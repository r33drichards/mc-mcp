A '''parrot''' is a [[tame]]able [[passive mob]] that spawns in jungle [[biome]]s. Parrots imitate [[sound]]s of nearby monsters and can perch on the [[player]]'s shoulders.

== Spawning ==
Parrots naturally spawn in groups of 1–2 in [[jungle]]s, [[bamboo jungle]]s, and [[sparse jungle]]s{{only|bedrock|short=1}} above [[log]]s, [[leaves]], [[grass block]]s, or [[air]].

Unlike most passive mobs, parrots cannot be [[bred]].

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Feather|edition=java|quantity=1-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Feather|edition=bedrock|quantity=1-2}}
}}
{{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs are dropped when parrots are killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Parrots fly around idly under normal circumstances, landing frequently to rest.<ref>{{tweet|MiaLem_n|846995981208096768|Yes they fly, as high as they want to. :) But they do get tired and prefer to have somewhere to land.|March 29, 2017}}</ref> They take interest in any nearby [[mob]]s, including those that are hostile to them, and follow them around closely. When attacked, they rapidly fly upward several blocks to flee.

Parrots also flap their wings to [[swim]], and to slow their falls and prevent [[fall damage]].

Parrots can be [[tame]]d by feeding them [[wheat seeds]], [[melon seeds]], [[pumpkin seeds]], [[beetroot seeds]], [[torchflower seeds]], or [[Pitcher Pod|pitcher pods]]. Each item fed has a {{frac|1|10}} chance of successfully taming them. Once tamed, {{control|interacting}} with a parrot makes it sit down and stand up.

A tamed parrot follows the [[player]] unless told to sit, and teleports if there is a distance of 12 blocks between it and the player (unless told to sit). A [[death message]] is displayed to a parrot's owner upon its death. 

{{IN|java}}, attempting to feed a parrot a [[cookie]] deals {{^|2|128}} damage to it, emitting [[Poison]] particles as it dies. {{IN|bedrock}}, attempting to feed a parrot a cookie also instantly kills it, but [[Fatal Poison]] is emitted instead. This is a reference to the fact that chocolate is toxic to parrots.

Unlike most [[animal]] mobs, parrots cannot [[breed]] and baby parrots do not exist.

=== Sitting on a shoulder ===
[[File:Parrot Shoulder.png|thumb|A [[player]] with a parrot on their shoulder.]]

A tamed parrot on the ground can be made to perch on its [[player]]'s shoulder by moving through the parrot. On its own, a tamed parrot can also fly to and perch on the player's shoulder, unless it has been told to sit. A player can have one parrot on each shoulder. Parrots always prefer a player's left shoulder first, if it is empty.

A parrot dismounts its player when the player:
* Lands on a higher surface ({{frac|1|2}} block up or higher)
* drops off a ledge of higher than {{frac|3|4}} of a block
* takes damage
* touches [[water]]
* touches [[powder snow]]
* is in creative [[flying]] mode
* starts gliding with an [[elytra]]<ref>{{bug|MC-118003}}</ref>
* sleeps on a [[bed]]
* submerges the player's head in [[lava]] (the parrot dismounts and burns even if the player has [[Fire Resistance]])

Parrots on a shoulder always look in the same direction the player's head is looking.

A parrot riding on an [[entity]] cannot take any [[damage]] (except [[void]] and {{cmd|kill}}).{{only|be}} 

But it may get hurt as soon as it dismounts, as when dismounting a player submerged in [[lava]].

A parrot sitting on the shoulder appears in the [[inventory]] interface.

{{IN|be}}, a parrot sitting on a shoulder prevents the player from entering a [[nether portal]].<ref>{{bug|MCPE-27950}}</ref>

If a player uses an [[ender pearl]] while parrots are on their shoulder, the parrots teleport with the player.

=== Imitating sounds ===
Parrots imitate the idle [[sound]]s of nearby [[monster]]s and {{in|bedrock}}, a few neutral [[animal]]s as well; they have a detection range of 20 blocks. The sound produced by the parrots is the same sound as the mob being mimicked at a higher pitch, the same pitch as the mob's baby variant. Occasionally, a parrot may imitate sounds of mobs that are not in the area.<ref>{{bug|MC-115509|resolution=Works as Intended}}</ref>

{{IN|be}}, they can also imitate neutral mobs such as [[endermen]], [[polar bear]]s, [[wolves]] and [[zombified piglins]]. {{IN|je}}, they can also imitate [[piglin]]s, [[hoglin]]s and [[piglin brute]]s. 

{{IN|java}}, parrots attempt to imitate [[happy ghast]]s, but without using the corresponding sound event.

Parrots don't imitate the sounds of [[skeleton horse]]s.<ref name="skelly">{{bug|MC-304373||Parrots don't imitate skeleton horses, endermen and zombified piglins}}</ref>

=== Dancing ===
Parrots dance near a [[jukebox]] if a [[music disc]] is inside it. Parrots even have the ability to dance while on a [[player]]'s shoulder.{{only|bedrock|short=y}} This is a reference to the Party Parrot meme.<ref>{{tweet|MiaLem_n|849665440733429761|It took you no time at all to find the party parrot easter egg! But there is one more you haven't found...|April 5, 2017}}</ref> They stop dancing when the track ends.<ref>{{bug|MC-157412|||F}}</ref>

The dancing radius is 3 blocks from the jukebox. If they dance and then fly beyond this radius, they stop dancing. A parrot does not dance if the music disc was inserted prior to it spawning, dismounting, or being within the 3 blocks range.<ref>{{bug|MC-115446|||WF}}</ref>
