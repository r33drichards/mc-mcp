A '''red mushroom''' is a variety of fungus that grows and spreads in dark areas. Mushrooms can generate small or [[Huge Mushroom|huge]] in size.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Red mushrooms can be [[instant mining|instantly mined]] with any tool, including by hand. Mining a red huge [[mushroom block]] drops up to 2 red mushrooms. [[Fortune]] does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.<ref>{{bug|MC-156657||Fortune doesn't work on mushroom blocks|Invalid}}</ref>

A red mushroom also breaks instantly and drops as an item if:
* the block below it is moved or destroyed
* a [[fluid]] flows over it
* a block next to it changes state, but only when it is ''not'' on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], or [[nylium]] and light level is 13 or higher
{{breaking row|Red Mushroom|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Red mushrooms naturally generate in poorly lit areas ([[light level]] of 12 or less). If this condition is met, each [[chunk]] has a {{frac|1|8}} (12.5%) chance to generate red mushrooms in the form of [[random patch]]es.<ref>{{IN|java}}, they rarely generate because they cannot generate underground due to {{bug|MC-244162}}.</ref>

Mushrooms also generate on the surface of a [[swamp]], [[old growth spruce taiga]], [[old growth pine taiga]], or [[mushroom fields]] biome, along with anywhere in [[the Nether]]. Unlike plants, they are able to generate on top of nearly any block type.

{{IN|java}}, they are commonly found in patches on the [[Nether roof]], and are the only blocks that can generate there. 

[[Witch hut]]s have a [[flower pot]] with a red mushroom inside. Mushrooms also generate inside "mushroom farm" rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s.

Red mushrooms planted on [[podzol]] can also be found around [[bogged]] and [[cave spider]] [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]]. 

==== Fallen trees ====
[[Fallen tree]]s can have up to 2 mushrooms generated on them.

{{block distribution|Red Mushroom}}

=== Huge mushrooms ===
Mining a red [[huge mushroom]] has a chance of dropping red mushrooms for each block mined.

=== Mob loot ===
{{Drop sources|Red Mushroom}}

[[Shear]]ing a red [[mooshroom]] drops 5 red mushrooms and permanently turns it into a normal [[cow]].

Shearing a [[bogged]] drops 2 mushrooms, both of which have a chance to be red.

An [[enderman]] holding a red mushroom drops it upon death.

A [[zombie]] riding a [[zombie horse]] has a 50% chance to drop a red mushroom upon death.

=== Trading ===
{{trade sources|Red Mushroom}}

== Usage ==
=== Planting ===
{{main|Mushroom#Planting}}
Red mushrooms can be planted and grown on blocks that have a full top surface in [[light]] levels below 13 and not directly underneath the sky, unless on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], or [[nylium]].

=== Mob food ===
Red mushrooms can be used to heal or tempt [[zombie horses]].

=== Huge mushrooms ===
{{main|Huge Mushroom#Growth}}
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a red mushroom, the mushroom has a chance to grow into a red [[huge mushroom]], provided that it is on a proper block ([[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]], or [[pale moss block]] at a light level of 12 or below; on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]] or [[nylium]] at any light level) and is free of [[solid block]]s within 5 blocks ''directly'' above the mushroom.

=== Spread ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Mushroom farming}}

When receiving a [[random tick]], a red mushroom has a 4% chance of spreading to a nearby block (including even above and below diagonally) if there are fewer than five red mushrooms in a 9×9×3 volume around the original mushroom.

=== Decoration ===
Red mushrooms can be planted in a [[flower pot]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Red Mushroom}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a mushroom into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Trivia ==
* The red mushroom is based on the poisonous ''[[wikipedia:Amanita_muscaria|Amanita muscaria]]'' (fly agaric).<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|1563155397115985920|I agree about the fly mushroom. I think Notch added it because it looks cool. The brown mushroom is a penny bun and is definitely edible. We currently aren't planning to change them, but we'll see in the future.}}</ref>
