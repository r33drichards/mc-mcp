|-
|[[File:MCB Chicken Blocker Render.png|100px]]
|Chicken
|Level 41
|Chickens are affected by gravity. Breaking blocks underneath them will cause them to fall toward the location of the broken blocks, and once they reach the end of the board, they count toward the goal.
|-
|[[File:MCB_Creeper.png|100px]]
|Creeper
|Level 61
|Creepers can be removed by making a match next to them, and they ignite. Making a second match near them while igniting causes them to explode, while failing to do so will reset the creepers' ignite counter.
|-
|[[File:MCB_Sheep_Render.png|100px]]<br>[[File:MCB_Sheep_without_Fur_Render.png|100px]]
|Sheep
|Level 10
|Sheep are used to collect wool by tapping on matching blocks right next to it. Once the wool is sheared off the sheep, it will eat the grass below it and regrow its wool. Sheep cannot be destroyed off the level and will stay until the amount of wool needed has been achieved, in this case the sheep will now be removed, and the shape will be filled by blocks.
|-
|[[File:MCB_Spider_Render.png|100px]]
|Spider
|Level 121
|Spiders will idle and can move around different lairs. If a spider is not defeated after 1 move, they will move in their lair or jump to a different one. After 2 moves, they prepare to launch a cobweb. After 3 moves, they launch the cobweb to a random block, creating a cobweb blocker in said block. This cycle repeats until they're defeated by making a match next to them.
|-
|[[File:MCB_Zombie_Render.png|100px]]<br>[[File:MCB_Zombie_with_Helmet_Render.png|100px]]
|Zombie
|Level 15
|Zombies move and idle around their zombie lairs which are inaccessible to blocks. Zombies can be removed by tapping on matching blocks right next to them. If all zombies within the lair are removed, the lair will disappear.
Zombies can come with either leather or gold helmets, increasing the number of matches required to remove them to 2 or 3 respectively.
