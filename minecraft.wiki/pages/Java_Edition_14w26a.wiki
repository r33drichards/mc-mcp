'''14w26a''' is the twenty-ninth [[snapshot]] released for [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]], released on June 25, 2014,<ref name="mojang">{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624075744/https://mojang.com/2014/06/minecraft-snapshot-14w26a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w26c|date=June 25, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> which adds the [[debug mode]] world type and the {{cmd|replaceitem}} command.

It was strongly advised to make a backup of a world before using this snapshot, because of block-corrupting problems that were not corrected until [[14w26c]].<ref name="mojang"/>
A potential means of recovering corrupted worlds using [[Programs and editors/Mapping#Map Editors|MCEdit]] is available.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/29551r/if_you_corrupted_a_large_project_or_lost_a_large/</ref>

This snapshot is the first after a decision to release snapshots on Wednesdays rather than on Thursdays.<ref name="mojang"/>

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[Debug mode]] world type'''
* Useful for [[resource pack]] makers.
* Hold {{key|shift}} and cycle through "World Type" to select it.
* Spectator mode recommended to avoid crashes (Creative mode can also be used without any effect on some machines).
* All possible blocks with all possible data values are generated. 
** They are arranged in a grid across height Y=70, with a [[barrier]] floor at Y=60.
* Blocks placed are deleted, and blocks destroyed are restored.
** There is a special generator option preventing this. It is called "debug_all_block_states". If the player changes this to "flat" or "default" in NBTexplorer, they are able to interact with the world. (Only for a short period though, on most machines there is a lot of lag or the game crashes - not recommended to play Survival on)

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|replaceitem <entity&#124;block> ...}}'''
* Can replace items in any inventory, including the inventories of mobs such as zombies.
** Full syntax: 
*** <code>/replaceitem entity <entity> <slot> <item> [amount] [data value]</code>.
*** <code>/replaceitem block <x> <y> <z> <slot> <item> [amount] [data value]</code>.
** Example: <code>/replaceitem entity @e[type=Zombie] slot.weapon minecraft:iron_sword 1 0</code> gives all the zombies iron swords.
** Example: <code>/replaceitem entity @p slot.hotbar.0 minecraft:fish 4 2</code> puts 4 clownfish in the players first hotbar slot.
** Example: <code>/replaceitem block ~ ~-1 ~ slot.container.5 minecraft:redstone_block 1 0</code> puts a redstone block in the 6th slot of a container 1 block beneath the player.

'''[[Gamerule]]s'''
* <code>sendCommandFeedback</code>
** If set to false, player-run commands don't show a success message.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* Switched to only/mostly using blockstates in the code, though not all block combinations are blockstates yet.

'''[[Command block]]s'''
* X/O button next to "Last output" in command block to turn off the last output string.

'''[[Furnace]]'''
* Empty furnaces now only accept fuel and empty buckets in the fuel slot.

'''[[Item frame]]s'''
* The wood part of the frame now uses the oak texture rather than the birch texture.

'''[[Melon stem]]s'''
* Changed model from [[File:Attached Melon Stem (N) JE3.png|32px]][[File:Attached Melon Stem (E) JE3.png|32px]][[File:Attached Melon Stem (S) JE3.png|32px]][[File:Attached Melon Stem (W) JE3.png|32px]] to [[File:Attached Melon Stem (N) JE4.png|32px]][[File:Attached Melon Stem (E) JE4.png|32px]][[File:Attached Melon Stem (S) JE4.png|32px]][[File:Attached Melon Stem (W) JE4.png|32px]]

'''[[Pumpkin stem]]s'''
* Changed model from [[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (N) JE3.png|32px]][[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (E) JE3.png|32px]][[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (S) JE3.png|32px]][[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (W) JE3.png|32px]] to [[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (N) JE4.png|32px]][[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (E) JE4.png|32px]][[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (S) JE4.png|32px]][[File:Attached Pumpkin Stem (W) JE4.png|32px]]

=== World generation ===
'''[[Old Customized|Customized]] world type'''
* Has an [[ocean monument]] toggle.

'''[[Swampland]]'''
* Re-added marsh-like areas which were removed in [[13w38b]] after initially being introduced in [[13w36a]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20221015041624/https://i.imgur.com/lQELvLX.jpg</ref>

'''[[Witch hut]]s'''
* No longer have a [[red mushroom]] inside the [[flower pot]].<ref>{{bug|MC-63820|||Fixed}}</ref>

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|execute}} '''
* Now has a <code>detect</code> argument (sub-command, only works when used with execute).
** Allows the <code>execute</code> command to run only if a block is detected at a specific location relative to the target.
** Example: <code>/execute @a ~ ~ ~ detect ~ ~-1 ~ minecraft:grass 0 say You are standing on grass.</code>.
'''{{cmd|fill}} '''
* Block limit changed from 4096 to 32768 blocks.
'''{{cmd|worldborder}}'''
** Now has an <code>add</code> argument.
*** Similar to the <code>set</code> argument, but can be used to add (or remove) a certain number of blocks to the world border distance.
*** Negative numbers can be used to remove blocks.
*** Example: <code>/worldborder add -75 </code> shrinks the world border width by 75 blocks.

=== General ===
'''[[Block models]]'''
* Instead of specifying uvs, the [[player]] can now choose textures to be projected onto the [[model]].

'''[[Resource pack|Resource]]s'''
* Reworked 3D resources, adding the possibility of new blocks with multiple textures.

* Items in [[first-person view]] no longer move up and down when switching between 2 identical items by changing the selected [[hotbar]] slot.
