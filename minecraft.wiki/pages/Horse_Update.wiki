The '''Horse Update''' is the name for {{el|je}} [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]], a major update released on July 1, 2013.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/06/minecraft-1-6-pre-release/|title=Minecraft 1.6 Pre-release|author=Jens Bergensten|website=Mojang.com|date=June 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725150604/https://mojang.com/2013/06/minecraft-1-6-pre-release/}}</ref> It added new features such as [[horse]]s, [[lead]]s, [[coal block]]s, [[carpet]]s, [[resource pack]]s and a new [[launcher]].

Development began the month after 1.5.1 was released. Eighteen development snapshots were released, from {{verlink|Java Edition 13w16a|13w16a}} to {{verlink|Java Edition 13w26a|13w26a}}. During the development period, [[Java Edition 1.5.2|1.5.2]] was released. Several iterations of the fourth launcher were released during this time period, from 0.1 to 1.2.2. Nearer the end of the snapshot cycle for the 1.6 update, Mojang focused primarily on fixing bugs, rather than adding new features.

The official name for the update, the Horse Update – was announced a week prior to the 1.6 prerelease on the ''Minecraft'' update tumblr (which is viewed in the launcher).

Mojang released the [[Java Edition 1.6-pre|1.6 pre-release]] on June 25, 2013. This included an [[easter egg]] where mobs named "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" were flipped upside down. The [[Java Edition 1.6.1-pre|1.6.1 pre-release]] was released on June 28, 2013, three days before the final release.
