'''Diamond leggings''' are a variant of [[leggings]] crafted from [[diamond]]s. They are the second-highest [[tier]] of leggings, having higher armor points, armor toughness, durability, and [[enchantability]] than [[iron leggings]]. They can be upgraded into [[netherite leggings]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have an extremely small chance to spawn wearing diamond armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

=== Trading ===

== Usage ==
When worn, diamond leggings provide {{armor|6}} [[armor points]] and {{armor|2}} [[armor toughness]].

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
Two damaged diamond leggings can be combined through [[crafting]] or using the [[grindstone]]. The durability of the used diamond leggings are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either leggings.

Diamond leggings can also be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[diamond]]s, with each diamond restoring 25% of the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. Two leggings of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods using the anvil preserves the leggings' [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A leggings can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a leggings, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
