=== Bee housing ===
[[File:HoneyDropletsExample.png|thumb|Dripping honey.]]
Bee nests and beehives can house up to 3 [[bee]]s at a time. They can enter through any unobstructed side, top, or bottom, but can exit only from the front, and only if it is unobstructed by a [[solid block]] (including a [[Opacity#Types_of_transparent_blocks|non-full solid block]] {{in|be}}).

Bees fly into a nest or hive at [[night]], during [[rain]], and after collecting nectar from a flower. They first look for one at the same coordinates as the last one they entered, but if there is no nest or hive there, or it already contains 3 bees when they arrive, they search the nearby area for another one.

[[Flint and Steel|Igniting]] a nest or hive allows any bees inside to escape, possibly catching fire as they flee.

=== Harvesting ===
{{Seealso|Tutorials/Honey farming}}

Once full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: [[honey bottle]]s and [[honeycomb]]s.

Each time a [[bee]] enters a nest or hive covered in nectar, it starts converting it to honey. After it is done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more nectar. If the bee hive or nest is in [[the Nether]] or in [[the End]] the bee exits as soon as it converts the nectar. When the bee exits, the hive increments its honey level by 1 and has a 1% chance to increment it by 2. Once it has the maximum honey level of 5, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it is not a full solid block, starts dripping honey [[particle]]s. (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron.) These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting.

To harvest a honey bottle, a player {{control|uses}} a glass bottle on the nest or hive; filling the bottle with honey. To harvest honeycombs, a player {{control|uses}} shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycombs. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance).

Alternatively, [[honey bottle]]s or [[honeycomb]]s can be harvested by [[Redstone mechanics|powering]] a [[dispenser]] containing either a [[glass bottle]] or [[shears]]. The dispenser must be directly facing the hive or nest.
[[File:Campfire beehive diagram max distance.png|thumb|This is the maximum distance a beehive can be from a [[campfire]] while applying the calming effect (5 [[block]]s).]]

Manually harvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the harvesting player, unless there is a [[fire]] directly beneath it or a lit [[campfire]] within five [[block]]s below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In ''Java Edition'', the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4–5 blocks below the nest.

=== Redstone component ===
Beehives and bee nests have a [[redstone comparator]] output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block, with a maximum signal strength of 5 once the block is completely full and ready for harvesting.

=== Note blocks ===
Beehives and bee nests can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sound.
