* The pillagers were previously mentioned by [[Jens Bergensten|Jeb]] in response to a suggestion posted on Reddit.<ref name="amount">https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/61n196/new_mob_idea_the_pillager/</ref>
*The Village & Pillage trailer has a few game mechanics that were not introduced in 1.14. At 34 seconds into the video, the player throws a sword, and at 44 seconds, a cleric throws [[Bluestone|a blue version of redstone]]. The blue redstone was later confirmed to have been a rendering error.<ref>{{tweet|chupacaubrey|1125130466955108353|Hey! Apparently there was a weird rendering error in the Village & Pillage trailer where some redstone wound up looking blue. This was not intentional. 😬 Just a mistake and not a reference or tease to anything. Sorry! 🙇🏻‍♀️|6 May 2019|archiveid=20190710053222}}</ref>
* The official artwork for the Village & Pillage update shows a [[witch]] holding a potion with one hand, despite the fact that witch's arms are always folded like those of a villager.
*On the ''China Edition'', the title screen is the Village & Pillage artwork, but with an extra vex and Steve flying with elytra.
