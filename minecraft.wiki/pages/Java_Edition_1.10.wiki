=== Blocks ===
[[File:Structure Void (item) JE1.png|32px]] '''[[Structure Void]]s'''
* It is an intangible block used to indicate to the structure blocks that certain [[air]] blocks can be overridden by previously existing blocks in the destination.
** Intended to be a replacement for the function [[barrier]] blocks used to convey (during early development), so they can form part of the structure itself.
* They are invisible and have a small hitbox.
** They are only visible when they are inside a structure being saved by a save [[structure block]]s and the toggle option "show invisible blocks" is true.
* Allows for empty spaces in a structure.
** Unlike air, it does not overwrite blocks where it is loaded.
** Example: If the player loads a 2 block high structure with air at the top and a structure void at the bottom into a 2 block high area of stone, the top block becomes air but the bottom remains as stone.

[[File:Magma Block JE1.gif|32px]] '''[[Magma Block]]s'''
* Found in [[the Nether]], generating 4 blobs per chunk between Y=27 and Y=36.
** It has a similar frequency to blocks like [[andesite]] in the [[Overworld]].
* Crafted using four [[magma cream]].
* Mobs and players take {{hp|1}} damage every second while touching it, similar to a [[cactus]].
** Unlike cactus or [[fire]], this block doesn't destroy items that touch it.
** Mobs avoid magma blocks that are in the way.
* Most mobs don't spawn on magma blocks. Exceptions are [[magma cube]]s, [[zombie pigmen]] and [[squid]].
* If the player is sneaking, wearing [[Frost Walker]]-enchanted [[boots]], or under the {{EffectLink|Fire Resistance}} effect, they do not take damage.
* If the player dies by standing on it, a new death message appears: "[Player] discovered floor was lava."
** If the player dies by the block, but after being damaged by a mob or player, the death message is: "[Player] walked into danger zone due to [Mob or Player]."
* Removes water blocks on top when [[block tick|randomly ticked]].
* It produces smoke [[particles]] under the [[rain]].
* It emits as much [[light]] as it receives from other sources.
** e.g. A magma block next to a torch emits light at level 13, as that was the light level it received from the torch.
*** If the torch were to be removed then it will search for the next brightest source of light; if no source is found then it will continue to emit the same amount of light as the torch.
*** It can emit daylight if it was exposed to the sun.
* Has a flowing magma animation.

[[File:Bone Block (UD) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] '''[[Bone Block]]s'''
* Crafted by filling a 3&times;3 square in the [[crafting table]] with [[bone meal]].
* Placing it in a crafting table yields 9 bone meal back.
* Found underground in desert and swamps as part of the [[fossil]] structure.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn Egg]]s'''
* [[File:Polar Bear Spawn Egg_JE1_BE1.png|32px]] [[Polar Bear Spawn Egg]]

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Polar Bear.png|32px]] '''[[Polar Bear]]s'''
* Adults and cubs spawn randomly as passive mobs in [[ice plains]], [[ice mountains]] and [[ice plains spikes]].
* When hit, adults attack the [[player]], and cubs run away (very fast, similar to baby zombies).
** Additionally, adults always attack the player when their cubs are around.
* Can swim faster in [[water]] than the player.
* Cubs follow their parents.
* Drops 0–2 [[raw fish]] (75% chance) or 0–2 [[salmon]] (25% chance), each increased by 1 per level of [[Looting]].

[[File:Stray JE1 BE3.png|32px]] '''[[Stray]]s'''
* 80% of [[skeleton]]s spawned above ground in [[ice plains]], [[ice mountains]] and [[ice plains spikes]] biomes are strays.
** All spawns where the skeleton does not have a view of the sky are normal skeletons.
** [[Spider]]s spawned in cold biomes have a chance of having a stray riding them.
* Acts mostly like a regular skeleton.
* Its <code>SkeletonType</code> tag is 2.
* Drops are the same as skeletons, but also have a 50% chance to drop 1 [[tipped arrow]] of {{EffectLink|Slowness}} when killed by the [[player]]. With Looting, chance increases to {{frac|2×level+1|2×level+2}}.
* Shoots tipped arrows of Slowness (0:30) at the target.

[[File:Husk JE1 BE1.png|32px]] '''[[Husk]]s'''
* 80% of [[zombie]]s spawned above ground in [[desert]], [[desert hills]] and desert biomes are husks.
** All spawns where the zombie does not have a view of the sky are normal zombies or zombie villagers.
* Behaves mostly like a regular zombie.
* Its <code>ZombieType</code> tag is 6.
* Does not burn in sunlight.
* Can spawn as a baby or as a [[chicken jockey]].
* Applies [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] when attacking, duration depends on raw [[regional difficulty]].
** Duration is equal to <code>7 × floor (RegionalDifficulty)</code> seconds.
** Hunger is only applied if the husk has an empty hand.
* Visually 2 pixels taller than a zombie, but has the same hitbox.

=== World generation ===
[[File:AllBoneFossils.png|thumb|249x249px|All fossils variations]] [[File:Fossil Spine 4.png|32px]] '''[[Fossil]]s'''
* Generates 15–24 blocks underground in [[desert]]s, [[swampland]] and their M and hills variants. Each chunk has a {{frac|1|64}} chance of generating a fossil.
* Composed of [[bone block]]s and some [[coal ore]], arranged as to resemble the skulls and spines of giant extinct creatures.
** There are 4 variants of the skull, and 4 variants of the spine sections.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Command]]s'''
* {{cmd|teleport}}
** Usage: <code>/teleport <Entity> [x] [y] [z] [<y-rot> <x-rot>]</code>
** Example: <code>/teleport @e[type=Cow] ~ ~ ~ 5 1</code>
** Teleports a selected entity to the executor's or player's relative position.

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* "Rule #1: it's never my fault"
* "Replaced molten cheese with blood?"
* "Absolutely fixed relatively broken coordinates"
* "Boats FTW"

'''[[Sounds.json#Sound_events|Sound events]]'''
* <code>block.enchantment_table.use</code>
* <code>entity.polar_bear.ambient</code>

'''[[Ambience]]'''
* Added new ambient sounds:
** <code>ambient/cave/cave15</code>
** <code>ambient/cave/cave16</code>

'''[[Options]]'''
* A new 'Auto-jump' toggle has been added, which automatically makes the [[player]] jump when running towards a one-block-tall obstacle.
** Enabled by default; can be disabled in [[options]].
** Brought from {{el|PE}}.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* A new tag <code>limit</code> for the <code>looting_enchant</code> function.
** Determines the maximum amount the player can expect to receive on mob drops when using the looting enchantment of any level.

'''[[Particle]]s'''
* A new <code>fallingdust</code> [[particle]] has been added.
** Appears underneath gravity-affected [[block]]s that generate, or have been placed with the use of bugs, suspended in midair.
** Sometimes appears whenever a gravity-affected block is placed without a support block below.
** Does not apply to [[dragon egg]]s.
** The particle collides with blocks.
** <code>fallingdust</code> can be summoned, making use of the <code>params</code> argument like <code>blockcrack</code> and several other particles do.
*** Example: {{cmd|particle fallingdust ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 0 1 0 @p 10}} summons a particle matching the color of lava (block 10)

'''NBT tags'''
* <code>FallFlying</code> byte tag
** Allows players, mobs and armorstands to use elytra when they fall
*** Mobs lose ability to fly after touching the ground
* <code>ZombieType</code> integer tag: Determines the kind of [[zombie]] a specific zombie is.
** 0: default, 1-5: villager, 6: husk.
** This tag, in effect, unifies the characteristics of being a zombie, a specific zombie villager and a husk into a single variable.
** Replaces the <code>IsVillager</code> and <code>VillagerProfession</code> tags.
* <code>ParticleParam1</code> and <code>ParticleParam2</code> integer tags for [[AreaEffectCloud]] entities.
** These work just like the two <code><params></code> arguments work, in {{cmd|particle}}.
** Example: {{cmd|summon AreaEffectCloud ~ ~1 ~ {Duration:600,Radius:2.0f,Particle:"iconcrack",ParticleParam1:351,ParticleParam2:3} }}
*** Summons a cloud of iconcrack particles with the texture of item 351 (dye), and data value 3 (cocoa beans).
** Example: {{cmd|summon AreaEffectCloud ~ ~1 ~ {Duration:600,Radius:2.0f,Particle:"blockcrack",ParticleParam1:12289} }}
*** Summons a cloud of blockcrack particles with the texture of block 1 (stone), and data value 3 (diorite), using the formula 1+(3×4096).

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|G}} toggles the visibility of [[chunk]] borders around the [[player]].
** Every time it is toggled, a message in chat appears.
** Shows a blue outline for the chunk the player is currently in and a yellow outline for individual [[air]] blocks in the vicinity of the chunk.
*** The blue outline in particular, outlines the chunk horizontally on top of the solid blocks on the ground.
*** The outlines extends arbitrarily up, but ends at [[bedrock]] level.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Structure block]]s'''
* The intended purpose is revealed.
** It is to allow the player to save and load different created structures in game, and offer a way to bundle such structures with the world.
* Are now available in item form; can be given or summoned.
** Similarly to [[command block]]s, its placement, destruction and modification are restricted to opped players in [[Creative]].
* Now comes with an integrated GUI and new textures.
* The block still has four modes, but each has a completely different texture than the original.
** '''Save''', S - build structure in world, tell the block where it is and it saves it to file.
** '''Load''', L - loads saved structure files, replacing blocks with saved blocks except for [[structure void]] blocks.
** '''Corner''', C - for automatic size calculation.
** '''Data''', D - for chest markers and other blocks that require data (default).
* Structures can be stored, bundled and loaded per world, in the "structures" folder
* Structures are limited to a size of 32 blocks in each direction.
* The coordinates used by the blocks are relative to themselves.
* When in use, it shows the outline of the structure it relates to in white
* Can rotate and mirror structures before they are placed on the three axis.
* L and S structure blocks can be activated by [[redstone]].
* Display a name tag above them indicating their mode and structure name.
* By toggling the option to show invisible blocks in save blocks, [[air]] blocks and [[structure void]] blocks will be made visible.
** Small blue cubes correspond to air blocks, red cubes correspond to structure void blocks (they are even smaller than the blue cubes).
* The game protects against maps saving arbitrary amounts of data to disk.

'''[[Dispenser]]s'''
* Can now equip [[shield]]s onto [[entities]].

'''[[End stone bricks]]'''
* The crafting recipe for End stone bricks now again gives four blocks instead of one.<ref group=note name="Release change" />

'''[[Rail]]s (all types)'''
* Bounding box for ascending rails is a full [[block]] (formerly only {{frac|5|32}} of a block tall).

'''[[Hardened clay]]'''
* Stained clay blocks are now named, for example, "Red Hardened Clay"
** Was previously, for example, "Red Stained Clay"

=== Items ===
'''[[Chorus fruit]]s'''

'''[[Ender pearl]]s'''
* Can now teleport riders from their mounts.

'''[[Firework rocket]]s'''
* Recipe now produces three rockets rather than only one.

'''[[Fishing rod]]s'''
* Can now pull items to the [[player]].

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Can now shoot while in a [[boat]].

'''[[Endermen]]'''
* Can now rarely spawn in [[the Nether]] with a {{frac|1|153}} rate.
** Compared to {{frac|100|153}} for [[zombie pigmen]].
* Can now naturally pick up [[netherrack]].

'''[[Magma cube]]s'''
* Spawn about twice as often in the [[Nether]].
** The rate is now {{frac|2|153}}, compared to {{frac|1|151}} before.

'''[[Skeleton]]s'''
* Skeletons holding a [[tipped arrow]] in their off hand now shoot that type of arrow.
** This overrides strays' normal shooting of slowness arrows.
** The arrows in the off hand are not consumed.
* Burning skeletons have a 50% chance of shooting flaming arrows if raw [[regional difficulty]] is 3 or greater.

'''[[Witch]]es'''
* Now drink a [[potion]] of Fire Resistance, if they don't already have the effect and the most recent [[damage]] taken (within the past 2 seconds) was fire damage.

'''[[Wolves]]'''
* No longer despawn.

'''[[Zombie]]s'''
* The "Zombie Generic Villager" is removed, due to the new <code>zombietype</code> tag.
* Chance of setting the target on fire when burning and duration of the effect now depends on raw [[regional difficulty]].
** Chance is now <code>(30 × RegionalDifficulty)%</code>; formerly 30% on Easy, 60% on Normal, 90% on Hard).
** Duration is now <code>2 × floor(RegionalDifficulty)</code> seconds; formerly 2 seconds on Easy, 4 on Normal, 6 on Hard.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Huge mushroom]]s'''
* Huge mushrooms have a {{frac|1|12}} chance of generating twice as tall as normal.
** These new mushrooms, which can be up to 13 blocks tall, can appear during world generation or by being planted by the [[player]].

'''[[Plains]] and [[sunflower plains]]'''
* Now have some trees in 5% of its chunks ({{frac|1|3}} large oaks, {{frac|2|3}} normal oaks).

'''[[Ice plains]], [[ice mountains]] and [[ice plains spikes]]'''
* Now don't spawn any passive mobs other than [[rabbit]]s and the new [[polar bear]]s.
* Also have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).

'''[[Mesa]]s, including all variants'''
* [[Hardened clay]] and [[stained clay]] no longer generate more than 15 blocks deep, if the mesa is more than 15 blocks above sea level.
* In addition to the normal 2 blobs of [[gold ore]] below Y=32, attempts to generate 20 blobs between Y=32 and Y=79.
* Generate the new type of [[mineshaft]]s, described below.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* New mineshaft type that generates in mesa biomes (including all variants).
** Placed so that the midpoint of the structure is near sea level, rather than so that the top is 10 blocks or more below sea level.
** Uses dark oak wood for wooden structures.
** New NBT tag <code>MST</code> on mineshaft structure pieces to indicate the type. 0 is the traditional mineshaft, 1 is the new mesa mineshaft.
* Features generate differently if above ground (i.e. the sky light where they generate is 8 or more). This is not dependent on mineshaft type.
** [[Cave spider]] spawners no longer generate if sky light is 8 or more.
** Various wooden pieces no longer generate if the block above is air and/or if sky light is 8 or more.
** [[Rail]]s in corridors are more complete if sky light is below 8.
*** 90%, versus 70% in 1.9 and in above-ground corridors.
** Ported from {{el|PE}}.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Village structures are no longer restricted by [[biome]] boundaries.
** Meaning that a village that starts in a valid biome can now spread into an adjacent invalid biome.
* Now generate in taigas (but not variants).
** They are made with spruce [[wood]].
* Savanna villages are now made with acacia wood instead of oak.
** In savannas, acacia logs replace cobblestone in all structures except churches, blacksmiths and the ground around wells.
* Blacksmiths in desert villages now generate with cobblestone rather than sandstone near the lava.
* Cobblestone is now generated around [[Village well|well]]s instead of gravel.
* Paths now only replace [[grass block]]s (with air above), [[water]], [[lava]], [[sand]], [[sandstone]] and [[red sandstone]], and no longer replace blocks below sea level. All other blocks are ignored, with blocks below (down to sea level) considered for replacement instead.
** This allows paths to generate properly under trees.
* Paths are made with different material depending on the existing terrain.
** If replacing grass blocks, the path is made from [[grass path]] blocks.
** If replacing water or lava, the path is made from [[planks]].
*** In desert villages, [[smooth sandstone]] is used instead of planks.
** If replacing sand, sandstone, or red sandstone the path is gravel on top of cobblestone.
*** In desert villages, sandstone is used instead of gravel and cobblestone.
*** In savanna villages, acacia logs are used instead of cobblestone.
* They have a 2% chance of being a zombie village, determined by <code>Zombie</code> NBT tag in <code>Village.dat</code>.
** All generated villagers are instead [[zombie villager]]s. These zombie villagers don't despawn (i.e. they have the <code>PersistenceRequired</code> flag set), but still burn in sunlight.
** There are no [[door]]s or [[torch]]es in the village.

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* No longer turn adjacent [[sand]] blocks in the ceiling into [[sandstone]] when generating.

'''[[End portal]]s'''
* Now replace any blocks inside the portal frame ring when activating.

=== Command format ===

'''[[Command]]s'''
* {{cmd|tp}}
** Can now teleport the [[player]] to a y-coordinate in the range &minus;4096 to 4096 (increased from &minus;512 to 512).
** Arguments <code><y-rot></code> and <code><x-rot></code> are now changed to <code><yaw></code> and <code><pitch></code>

=== General ===

'''[[Achievement]]s'''
* ''Hot Topic'' is now described as "construct a furnace out of eight ''cobblestone'' blocks" <ref group=note name="Release change" />
** Was previously "construct a furnace out of eight ''stone'' blocks".

'''[[NBT tag]]s'''
* <code>NoGravity</code> now works for all [[entities]], not only [[armor stand]]s.
** A mob in midair affected by it still responds to knockback by moving horizontally.
*** Although the AI will not permit any mob to move on their own, [[horse]]s and [[pig]]s ridden by the player move normally.
**** Very similarly, [[boat]]s in the [[air]] ridden by the player, move as if they were in [[water]].

'''[[Options]]'''
* <samp>[[options.txt]]</samp> now displays the [[data version]] the file was last saved in.
* [[Options#Video Settings|VBOs]] are now enabled by default, overriding old options when upgrading.

'''[[Particle]]s'''
* <code>fallingdust</code> particle now collides with blocks.

== Trivia ==
* This update has the fewest amount of snapshots to date, with a mere 3 compared to the 20–30 from previous and later updates.
** This started the period from 1.10 to [[Java Edition 1.12]] where Mojang reverted to pushing out updates quickly, similar to the updates before [[Java Edition 1.8]].
* The time span between the releases of the first snapshot, [[16w20a]], and the first pre-release, [[1.10-pre1]], is only 2 weeks, which is abnormally short by Mojang standards.
* This was also the fastest time between the first snapshot and full release, having been only about 3 weeks.
* 1.10 was released exactly 5 years before [[Java Edition 1.17|1.17]].
