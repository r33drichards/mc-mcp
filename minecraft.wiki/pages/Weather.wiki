[[File:Weather.png|thumb|The four main weather types, including clear weather, [[rainfall]], [[thunderstorm]], and [[snowfall]].]]
'''Weather''' in {{MC}} consists of occasional precipitation and storms that are temporary but global.<ref>{{Tweet|notch|55984678875836416|It's temporal and global|April 07, 2011}}</ref>

== Behavior ==
[[File:WeatherSkyComparison.png|thumb|upright|A comparison of sky light levels during different types of weather. {{IN|Be}}, both rainy and stormy weather are grayscale.]]

The type of weather that occurs depends on several variable factors, including the [[Biome#Temperature|temperature]] of the current biome, and the [[altitude]] in which it occurs. 

Players who have cheats enabled can change the current weather if they wish, using the {{cmd|weather}} command. {{IN|bedrock}}, {{cmd|toggledownfall}} also switches to inclement weather, or vice versa.

Weather changing with time can be toggled on or off using the {{cd|doWeatherCycle}} [[game rule]]. When set to {{cd|false}}, the weather stays the same indefinitely, unless altered using the {{cmd|weather}} command.

== Effects ==
Inclement weather reduces the sky [[light]] level, depending on the severity of the storm. Because of this, [[villager]]s return to their homes until the storm passes.

The sky itself darkens, to the point where celestial bodies (including the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[Moon#Stars|stars]]) are no longer visible. The clouds darken depending on the severity of the weather; note that the clouds themselves do not precipitate. Although the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.

=== Rain ===
{{Main|Rain}}

Rain occurs only in biomes with a temperature of 0.15–0.95. Rainstorms reduce the light level to 12 in full daylight.<ref>{{Tweet|notch|55982751265988610|You can't see sun/moon/stars while it's raining, and days are one level darker.|April 07, 2011}}</ref>

Rain extinguishes [[fire]]s (including [[Flame|flaming arrows]]<ref>{{tweet|notch|55977565839564800|I'm not making it solidify lava, as that would ruin all surface lava structures when the first rain hits. But it does put out fires.|April 07, 2011}}</ref>). However, it does not extinguish fires on [[netherrack]],<ref>{{tweet|notch|56265234951831552|it will not!|April 08, 2011}}</ref> and it does not [[obsidian|solidify]] [[lava]]. [[Mob]]s that are on fire are extinguished on contact with rain; this prevents [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s from burning during the day. Conversely, [[endermen]] and [[snow golem]]s may die due to their weakness to water. Endermen teleport randomly until they find a dry place. [[Blaze]]s and [[strider]]s that are brought into the [[Overworld]] take damage and eventually die from being in contact with rain.

[[File:Rainy Hills.png|thumb|A view of hills during rain.]]

Other interesting effects caused by rain:

* [[Fish (food)|Fish]] are more abundant during rain.<ref>{{tweet|notch|55981125994156032|Higher odds of catching fish while raining.. Good one. :D I'll try making it fill small holes with water, but it might be annoying.. brb|April 07, 2011}}</ref>
* [[Wolves]] shake themselves dry if they are not moving {{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
* [[Farmland]] becomes hydrated if it isn't already.<ref>{{tweet|notch|55972362432151552|Wolves get wet in the rain. Crops get watered. Anything else it should affect?|April 07, 2011}}</ref>
* Rain fills up [[cauldron]]s with [[water]], albeit slowly.

Rain [[particle]]s make noise when they hit a block, and this noise can be heard at any point within 16 blocks. These particles can be disabled by setting Particles to "Minimal" in the [[Video Settings]] menu.{{only|java}}

{{-}}

=== Snow ===
{{Main|Snowfall}}[[File:Snowing BE.jpg|thumb|An example of snow falling.]]

Snowfall occurs only in biomes with a temperature less than 0.15, or above a sufficient altitude. Like rainstorms, snowfall reduces the light level to 12 in full daylight. {{IN|be}}, [[leaves]] gradually take on a frosted appearance once snowfall begins in snowy biomes.

As it snows, [[snow layer]]s regenerate over all non-transparent blocks.<ref>{{tweet|notch|55919635593306112|Ice and snow will regrow, farms will autowater|April 07, 2011}}</ref> {{IN|be}}, these snow layers accumulate and grow over time. Snow does not cover [[Opacity|transparent blocks]].

Any entities on fire are not extinguished upon contact with snow.

=== Thunderstorm ===
{{Main|Thunderstorm}}
[[File:LightningStrike.gif|A lightning bolt strikes a [[tree]]. A creeper can be seen walking through the woods. If it had been closer to the strike, it would have become [[Creeper#Charged creeper|charged]].|thumb|width=199x199]]
Thunderstorms may occur in any biome and are combined with rain, snowfall, or clear weather depending on the temperature. They reduce the [[Light#Internal light level|internal sky light level]]. At noon the internal sky light level at surface is only 10. However, in mob spawning system, the light level from the sky is treated as if it were 0, allowing hostile mobs to spawn at any time of the day.<ref>{{Tweet|notch|57363403102105600|MUOAHAHA! Thunder Storms lower the brightness. That means daytime monsters during storms. This is freakily atmospheric.|April 11, 2011}}</ref>

==== Lightning ====
{{main|Thunderstorm#Lightning}}

[[Lightning]] occurs frequently during thunderstorms, if there is rain. It strikes randomly, creating [[fire]]s where it strikes, igniting any nearby flammable materials, but the rain usually puts the fire out before it can spread. Lightning can strike only blocks that are exposed to the rain.
Lightning does not occur naturally in biomes that are too hot or dry to have rain or so cold that it snows instead of rains, but can still be summoned with a channeling trident.<!-- Observations of no natural lightning in hot/dry/all snow biomes, that there is lightning in biomes that snow only above a certain altitude, and that channeling tridents still work, done in Java 1.19.2 -->

Lightning deals {{hp|5}} damage to entities on normal difficulty, not including the damage done by the fire it causes. It turns creepers into [[charged creeper]]s, [[villager]]s into [[witch]]es, [[pig]]s into [[zombified piglin]]s, and [[mooshrooms]] into their brown variants.

Lightning may randomly spawn a [[Skeleton Horse|"skeleton trap" skeletal horse]], with a chance of 3.75–7.5% on Easy, 7.5–20% on Normal, and 11.25–33.75% on Hard, depending on the [[regional difficulty]].

Thunder is a sound that occurs every time lightning strikes. It can be heard by the player up to 160,000 blocks away from the position of the lightning strike. Thunder is heard instantly, regardless the player's distance from the lightning strike itself.

Lightning may be manually summoned with the {{cmd|summon lightning_bolt}} command. While it is summoned as an entity, it cannot be referred to by [[commands]] or [[Commands#Selectors|selectors]].

If the player throws a trident enchanted with [[channeling]] during a thunderstorm, it summons a lightning bolt at the thrown area.

=== End flash ===
{{Main|End flash}}
[[File:Vibrant Visuals End flash.gif|thumb|An End flash {{in|Bedrock}}.]]
An end flash is a weather-like event that occurs in the End. Block lighting becomes purple tinted during the flash, which is more noticeable on lower brightness settings, and a sound effect plays. There is a 30 second delay between flashes, and each flash lasts between 5 and 19 seconds. End flashes are only visual, and thus do not affect gameplay. {{IN|bedrock}}, End flashes only occur when [[Vibrant Visuals]] is enabled, and are treated as global directional light sources, creating shadows.

== History ==
{{info needed section|the possibility that rain/snow textures were originally inverted in-game, as shown in the following forum post: https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/legacy-support/1841577-weird-rain-bug - testing in 22w14a did not reveal any such inversion existing, meaning it was likely fixed at some point between 1.2.5 and 22w14a}}

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
[[File:Void Rain.png|thumb|right|Rain falling into the void.]]

* Rain and snow still falls above the clouds. Notch's explanation is that the gray above the clouds during a storm is “another layer of clouds” and the origin of the rain.<ref>{{tweet|notch|130230769347067905|there's another layer of clouds above the low one! That's why the sky turns gray.|October 29, 2011}}</ref>
* Rain and snow are both considered the same weather effect by the game. This explains why there is no {{cmd|weather snow}} command.
* Rain and snow actually fall one block into the void (Layer -1). This can be seen in Creative Mode by floating in the Void. No particles are emitted from the rain, due to the absence of a block below it for it to fall on.
* Lightning does not have an image file associated with it. Thus, it is coded directly into the game engine, allowing for dynamic, realistic lightning.
*[[Helen Zbihlyj]] created a design document for a scientifically accurate rework of ''[[Minecraft]]'''s weather system.<ref>{{tweet|HelenAngel|1808933672143499454|Fun fact: there’s already a design document at Mojang with a scientifically correct & complete reworking of the weather system that would still make it biome-appropriate as it goes by thermotropic weather patterns. I know because I designed it. So the design doc is there.|July 4, 2024}}</ref>
