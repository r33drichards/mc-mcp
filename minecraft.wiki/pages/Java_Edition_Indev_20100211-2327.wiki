== Bugs ==
'''3 bugs reported'''
* The light level often wouldn't match the time of day.
* In some instances, performance would deteriorate and the game would become near-unplayable as a result.
* Due to the addition of daylight cycle, there is now a bug where during sunset and sunrise changes of the light level can cause extreme amount of chunk updates and temporary game lags. This bug remained in the game until [[Beta 1.8]].

== Trivia ==
* The [[al_version]] number of this version is 1.096, but the number of the [[Java Edition Indev 20100207-1703|previous version]] is 1.093. The two numbers between them might correspond to currently missing or [[Wikipedia:LWJGL|LWJGL]] updates. One of these updates may have been released on February 8.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(14:41:56) <Notch> I just updated openal for macos with the info from that thread."{{info needed|should be added info about "that thread"}}</ref>
