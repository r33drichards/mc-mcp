A '''hoglin''' is a breedable [[hostile mob]] found in [[the Nether]], and a source of [[porkchop]]s and [[leather]]. Hoglins are repelled by [[warped fungi]] that is placed in the world as well as active [[Nether portal]]s and [[respawn anchor]]s. It attacks by thrusting its tusks upward, which can also launch its target a short distance into the air.

'''Baby hoglins''' behave similarly, but have a much weaker attack (the weakest attack in the game) with normal knockback, and flee when hit.

== Spawning ==
Hoglins are found in herds of 3–4 in [[crimson forest]]s, respawning over time. They can spawn at any [[light level]] and on most solid blocks other than [[Nether wart block]]s and [[shroomlight]]s.{{Only|bedrock|short=BE}}

Hoglins spawn in certain types of [[bastion remnant]]s upon structure generation. They spawn frequently in the hoglin stable variant (specifically the large and small stables in the "lower" area, but never in the "upper" area with ramparts), and sometimes in the main "bridge entrance" at the upper half of the rampart in the bridge variant. Similar to the [[piglin]]s and [[piglin brute]]s there, these hoglins never despawn.

20% of hoglins spawn as babies.

Hoglins need at least a 1×1×1.5 area to spawn. While adult hoglins will spawn inside a top slab if there is enough room, they will not pathfind unless they have more space above them. Adult hoglins will pathfind if they are in a top trapdoor, however.

{{IN|Java}}, hoglins do not naturally spawn in the Peaceful [[difficulty]] except during [[world generation]] as part of [[bastion]]s, they are however, passive.

* {{xp|5}} if killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

Baby hoglins drop only experience when killed, at the same rate as adult hoglins. They are also the only baby [[animal]]s that drop experience.

== Behavior ==
Hoglins avoid being within 7 blocks of [[warped fungi]] (including in a [[flower pot]]), [[Nether portal]]s and [[respawn anchor]]s. They naturally sink in [[water]] and eventually drown.<ref>{{bug|MC-172102|resolution=WAI}}</ref> They also sink in [[lava]] and are vulnerable to [[fire]] damage.<ref>{{bug|MC-172087|resolution=WAI}}</ref> Hoglins can be led with a [[lead]] even though they are hostile. 

=== Hostility ===
Hoglins attack any [[player]] within 16 [[block]]s with a reach of 1.9 blocks. An adult knocks its target upward{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>This does not happen in Bedrock Edition due to {{bug|MCPE-74465}}.</ref>. Players can still be flung even if they block with a [[shield]]. Hoglins do not attack a player standing near [[Tags#blocks hoglin repellents|a block that repels them]], but instead run away from the block unless they have already chosen to attack. If a player has a hoglin on a lead, then the hoglin still attacks players who get within its attack range, but does not actively pursue and attack the player leading it.{{only|JE}} Hoglins are 60% resistant to knockback. Unlike other hostile mobs, they do not prevent a player from [[sleeping]].

Similar to [[piglin]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s, a player or mob attacking a hoglin provokes all nearby hoglins. Attacking a baby hoglin does not trigger this behavior.

If a piglin attacks a hoglin, all the hoglins in the area retaliate. Hoglins also flee if outnumbered and make retreating sounds. If the piglins are outnumbered by hoglins, they flee and make retreating sounds.

[[Piglin]]s do not hunt hoglins that spawn upon generation of [[bastion remnant]]s.

Like piglins, hoglins retaliate when attacked by a [[goat]]{{only|je}}<ref>{{bug|MC-227625}}</ref>.

=== Baby hoglins ===
Baby hoglins also attack the player, dealing much less [[damage]] and normal knockback. If the player attacks a baby hoglin, it temporarily flees.

Baby [[piglin]]s run near and ride baby hoglins. If there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.

=== Zombification ===
[[File:Hoglin being Zombified.gif|thumb|right|upright|A hoglin turning into a [[zoglin]]. Notice the texture change and the vibration.]]
If a hoglin spawns in or moves to the [[Overworld]] or [[the End]], it shakes and then transforms into a [[zoglin]] after 15 seconds. If the world is in Peaceful [[difficulty]], the zoglin disappears instantly. If not, the newly-created zoglin gets [[Nausea]] I for 10 seconds{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>This does not happen in Bedrock Edition due to {{bug|MCPE-70866}}.</ref>. This Nausea effect is only decorative and has no effect on the zoglin's behavior.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}

Hoglins can be bred with [[crimson fungi]]. It takes 5 minutes before the parents can be bred again, and it takes 20 minutes for baby hoglins to mature. Baby hoglins stay near their parents unless they see a player or get attacked, in which case they attack or run away. Feeding a crimson fungus to a baby hoglin reduces the remaining time for it to mature by 10%.

Hoglins cannot be bred when they are running away from warped fungi, respawn anchors, or Nether portals.

Feeding crimson fungi to a hoglin prevents it from [[despawning]], whether the breeding is successful or not. The baby hoglin produced by breeding does not despawn either.

Like the [[killer bunny]],{{only|java}} the hoglin is one of the only [[hostile mob]]s that can be [[bred]].

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*Hoglins run away from warped fungi because they dislike their smell.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1474319623478820879|Contrary to popular belief, Hoglins in Minecraft aren't actually afraid of warped fungus. They just think it smells really bad, so getting away from it takes priority over both breeding and fighting.|December 24, 2021}}</ref> When asked if Nether portals also smell bad to hoglins, Henrik responded that hoglins are annoyed by the sounds Nether portals make.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1474347357177323524|No, but the sound is annoying to them.|December 24, 2021}}</ref>
*Similar to the [[ravager]] originally being called "[[illager]] beast" before its official name was chosen by the community, the hoglin's name was also chosen by the community. Its initial placeholder name was "piglin beast".
*{{IN|Bedrock}}, there are unused texture files named {{cd|hoglin_meat_raw}} and {{cd|hoglin_meat_cooked}} that are textured identically to [[Raw Beef|raw]] and [[cooked beef]], respectively.
*[[Henrik Kniberg]] released a video<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UeeF4lMPnk Hoglin dance (blooper - not actually in the game)]; Henrik Kniberg - May 25, 2020</ref> of a group of hoglins killing a [[piglin]], then "celebrating" by bobbing their heads, then getting on their hind legs and dancing. This feature was never added into any snapshot and is not actually in ''Minecraft'', although the reverse situation has a small chance to occur, in which piglins dance after killing a hoglin.
*The hair and and body texture of the hoglin to not line up, as the body was inflated to avoid Z-fighting.
