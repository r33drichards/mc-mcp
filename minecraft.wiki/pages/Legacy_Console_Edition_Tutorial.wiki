The '''Tutorial''' is a world that introduces the [[player]] to the basic mechanics of ''Minecraft''. Available only in the [[Legacy Console Edition]], it allows newcomers to familiarize themselves with the game, primarily with the [[controls]] and the [[crafting|crafting system]]. The world and presentation differ depending on the version of the game it was created in; however, the basic tutorial mechanics remain the same. All versions begin with the [[player]] in a small, enclosed area where building, crafting, mining, and survival mechanics are introduced. The tutorial world contains twelve hidden [[chest]]s with [[music disc|music discs]] that the player can search for.

== Concepts covered ==
The tutorial walks the player through:

* Chopping [[wood]]
* Game [[Controls#Xbox 360 Edition|controls]]
* Creating [[planks]] and a [[crafting table]]
* [[Inventory]] use
* Creating basic [[tool]]s
* Using a [[furnace]]
* Building a shelter
* Surviving the night
* [[Sprinting]]
* [[Jumping]]
* [[Hunger]] and [[Health]]

''Other tutorials for features such as [[bed]]s, [[Nether portal]]s, [[trading]], [[boat]]s, [[piston]]s, [[brewing]], and [[fishing rod]]s are scattered throughout the world, but are not part of the main tutorial.''

== Tutorial area ==
[[File:Minecraft sign in Xbox 360 tutorial.png|thumb|275px|The ''Minecraft'' logo as it used to appear in the tutorial. ([[Xbox 360 Edition TU1|TU1]]-[[TU46]])]]
* The tutorial world depends on the version of the game that it is created in.
** The tutorial world on ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' introduces features added in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU46|TU46]], such as the [[Elytra]]. Since these two editions equate to the [[World of Color Update]], they currently use an older version of the tutorial world than the other [[Legacy Console Edition]]s.
** The tutorial world on ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'', and ''[[Wii U Edition]]'' introduces [[Update Aquatic]] features added in TU69.

* When a player joins the tutorial world, they are initially spawned into a small forest area with an incomplete miner's shelter. This basic tutorial area is enclosed by a natural wall. The player cannot leave this area until they have completed or skipped the basic tutorial, which teaches them aspects of the game including [[controls]], [[menu]]s, [[crafting]], [[smelting]], and [[building]]. In early iterations of the tutorial, players could learn about basic [[Redstone_mechanics|redstone]] contraptions, [[fishing]], and [[boats]] ([[Xbox 360 Edition TU1|TU1]]-[[Xbox 360 Edition TU11|TU11]]). This was changed in later updates ([[Xbox 360 Edition TU12|TU12]]+), as the basic tutorial area was simplified.{{info needed}}
** from [[Xbox 360 Edition TU46|TU46]] onward, the walls around the spawn area would become towering, giving a more claustrophobic feeling than the previous ones

* Once the player leaves the basic tutorial area, they can explore the rest of the tutorial world

* From [[Xbox 360 Edition TU5|TU5]] onward, twelve [[music disc]]s were hidden throughout the tutorial world. Players could explore the tutorial world to find them all. They were often hidden in various man-made structures, such as the Minecraft logo.

* From [[Xbox 360 Edition TU7|TU7]] onward, the immediate area outside of the tutorial world featured sub-tutorials for features such as [[enchanting]] and [[brewing]]. As new features were added with updates, respective tutorial areas were added as well.

* Some of the Tutorial worlds received updates when new features were added 
**The [[Xbox 360 Edition TU3|TU3]] update improved the [[Xbox 360 Edition TU0|TU0]] tutorial world with the following:
***[[Redstone component]]s were added to the spawn area, including a tutorial explaining [[piston]]s to the [[player]]
***A [[cobblestone generator]] bridge was added in front of the castle
***A secret [[Nether Portal]] was included inside the floating Minecraft logo
***An underwater cavity containing a full set of [[diamond]] [[tool]]s and [[armor]] was added next to the castle
**The [[Xbox 360 Edition TU9|TU9]] update improved the [[Xbox 360 Edition TU7|TU7]] tutorial world with the following:
***Added new structures for [[player]]s to explore
***The locations of the 12 [[music disc]]s were changed
**The [[Xbox 360 Edition TU14|TU14]] update improved the [[Xbox 360 Edition TU12|TU12]] tutorial world with the following:
***New tutorials were added for [[villager trading]], [[item repair]], and [[ender chest]]s
***Added new structures for [[player]]s to explore
***The locations of the 12 [[music disc]]s were changed

*In total, there are eight unique tutorial worlds ([[Xbox 360 Edition TU0|TU0]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU5|TU5]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU7|TU7]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU12|TU12]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU19|TU19]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU31|TU31]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU46|TU46]], and [[Xbox 360 Edition TU69|TU69]] respectively)
**Each distinct tutorial world featured unique world generation

*The main castle in the [[Xbox 360 Edition TU12|TU12]] and [[Xbox 360 Edition TU14|TU14]] tutorial worlds is a recreation of Edinburgh Castle in Edinburgh, Scotland<ref name=":0">"This is the seventh tutorial world from the Console Edition of Minecraft. It includes a tutorial area, The Edinburgh Castle, and various other structures throughout" (Tu14's Description on https://www.theminecraftarchitect.com/tutorial-worlds/tu14)</ref>
**[[Xbox 360 Edition TU31|TU31]] is a recreation of various structures from Scotland, which also contains the same recreation of Edinburgh Castle

* Tutorial worlds slowly became bigger and better. While early tutorial worlds only featured tutorials for basic features and a few builds, later tutorials included a swath of manmade structures for the player to explore, often [[w:Edinburgh_Castle|resembling structures]] in [[w:Scotland|real life]]<ref name=":1">https://www.theminecraftarchitect.com/tutorial-worlds/tu31 "This is the ninth tutorial world from the Console Edition of Minecraft. It includes a tutorial area and a variety of real-world structures from Scotland throughout" (TU31's Description on https://www.theminecraftarchitect.com/)</ref>.

* The names for the tutorial worlds originated from [[Xbox 360]] title updates
**''[[Xbox 360 Edition TU3|Title Update 3]]'', for example, is shortened to ''[[Xbox 360 Edition TU3|TU3]]''

== Trivia ==
* In the TU3-4 tutorial world, there is an underwater room containing a full set of diamond armor & tools. It is located to the right of the castle's tallest tower, outlined with white wool at the top.
* In the TU3-4 tutorial world, there is a lever on each side of the floating Minecraft logo. Flipping it reveals a concealed hallway with a lit nether portal in the middle. 
* In the TU3-4 tutorial world, there is a gravel "x" at the coordinates (213, 75, 55). Digging down reveals a dungeon with a skeleton spawner.
* In the TU5-6 tutorial world, chests on the outer portions of the world often fail to generate when the tutorial world is initially loaded. It's difficult to generate this tutorial world with all twelve chests. This glitch can occur in the TU7-11 tutorial world, yet it is less common..
* TU12-14 contain a recreation of Edinburgh Castle as the main area <ref name=":0" />
** it also reappears in TU31's tutorial world<ref name=":1" />
*TU31-45 is a recreation of various places in Scotland <ref name=":1" />
* The western main island of the TU19 tutorial world is based off of Isle of Skye and Stampy’s Island being based off Isle of Rum
* In the southwest corner of the TU19 tutorial world Stampylonghead’s House and SS Stumpy from the popular YouTube series 'Stampy's Lovely World' can be found along with two music discs.
* In the TU69 tutorial world, the world of the old TU46 tutorial world can be located south of the new spawn. The orientation in which the old spawn was sunken and aligned is a reference to the then [[Update Aquatic]].
* An empty version of the TU12 main area (Edinburgh Castle) also appears in TU31, it even includes the main spawn area. it's located northwest on the map <ref name=":1" />
