'''Crafting''' is the process of constructing [[tool]]s, [[item]]s, and [[block]]s in ''[[Minecraft]]'' that can be performed via the [[inventory]], a [[crafting table]], or automatically using a [[crafter]].

== Crafting system ==
=== Manual crafting ===
[[File:Crafting2x2.png|frame|2×2 Crafting grid ([[inventory]])]]
[[File:Crafting3x3.png|frame|3×3 Crafting grid ([[crafting table]])|alt=Crafting table grid]]
Players in [[Survival]] and [[Adventure]] mode, as well as [[Creative]] {{in|bedrock}} and [[Spectator]] {{in|java}}, have access to a [[2×2 crafting grid]] from their inventory screen. Players craft by arranging items in the crafting grid to match a given recipe. Small crafting recipes that are at most 2×2 can be made there, including wooden [[plank]]s, [[stick]]s, [[crafting table]]s, and [[torch]]es.

To craft more complex items, a crafting table must be created, placed, and {{control|used}}. This brings up an interface with a larger 3×3 crafting grid in which the player can use to craft any crafting recipe in the game. Recipes fitting the 2×2 grid can also be crafted in the crafting table's 3×3 grid. There is a [[recipe book]] button in the inventory where the player can access all of their unlocked crafting recipes.

Some recipes don't require their ingredients to be arranged in a specific way on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as ''"shapeless"'' recipes. For example, players may craft a [[fermented spider eye]] by placing its ingredients anywhere within the grid.

Most recipes must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid. These are commonly known as ''"shaped''" recipes. Ingredients in shaped recipes can be moved up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped horizontally, but not vertically. For example, a 3×1 recipe, such as [[bread]], can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3×3 grid, and a [[bow]] may be made with the strings placed on the left instead of on the right.

There are recipes that may not be moved or mirrored in this way. These are commonly known as ''"fixed"'' recipes. For example, dyes in banner recipes - only available {{in|bedrock}} - must be specifically placed to achieve the desired pattern. No fixed recipes exist in ''Java Edition'', but they can be added by [[data pack]]s, [[add-on]]s, or [[mod]]s.

Unlike other in-game actions such as [[smelting]], [[brewing]], and [[enchanting]], crafting is completely silent.

=== Automated crafting ===
Crafting can be automated using the [[crafter]].

The simplest way to do this is for the player to add the items for the crafting into the crafter manually, however this process can itself be automated using [[hopper]]s. In order to control which slots the hopper puts the item into it is possible to disable certain slots to prevent the input of items. When items are put into a crafter automatically they fill every enabled slot equally from left to right and top to bottom, in that order. If all slots are disabled, then hoppers connected to it cannot put items in it. 

The crafter can craft anything that a normal crafting table can.

Crafters require a [[Redstone mechanics#Redstone signal|redstone signal]] to activate.

Automated crafting is useful in both [[Tutorials/Organization|storage systems]] and [[Farming|automated farms]], as it provides a way to automatically craft items and blocks that otherwise requires manual input.

=== Recipe book ===
{{main|Recipe book}}
The recipe book is a mechanic that serves as a catalog of [[recipe]]s and as a crafting guide. It shows every crafting recipe that the player has unlocked. 

Crafting recipes are organized in several different categories. The categories differ between ''Java'' and ''Bedrock''.

{{IN|be}}, categories consist of craftable items from each [[Creative inventory]] tab.

{{IN|java}}, the categories are as follows:
* The first tab contains every unlocked recipe.
* The second tab contains utility items, [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, and [[armor]].
* The third tab contains building materials.
* The fourth tab contains [[food]], ingredients, and miscellaneous items.
* The fifth tab contains [[redstone]] materials.

=== Recipe system ===
{{main|Recipe}}
Recipes, including crafting recipes, can be configured by [[data pack]]s {{in|java}} or [[add-on]]s {{in|bedrock}}.

== {{anchor|Recipes}}Complete recipe list ==
To save space, some recipes are animated (requires [[wikipedia:JavaScript|JavaScript]]). On this wiki, shapeless recipes are marked with a pair of intertwined arrows on the crafting table graphic, while fixed crafting recipes are marked by an exclamation point. These symbols do not appear in the game.
