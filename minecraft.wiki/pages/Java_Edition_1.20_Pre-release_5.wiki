== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* {{cd|uniform}} font has been updated to use Unifont 15.0.03.
** During the updates of Unifont, some CJK unified ideographs in [[wikipedia:Plane (Unicode)#Supplementary Ideographic Plane|Plane 2]] were added to the basic Unifont font files for coverage of the [[wikipedia:Table of General Standard Chinese Characters|General Standard Chinese Characters]] set, and some in Plane 3, notably the character [[wikipedia:Biangbiang noodles|biang from Biangbiang noodles]].
** Updated full width punctuations and symbols in the range U+FF00 to U+FFEF so they no longer appear stretched.
** Minor updates to other individual glyphs, notably a much improved skunk glyph (U+1F9A8).<ref>[http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html GNU Unifont Glyphs - Unifoundry.com], [http://web.archive.org/web/20230523154307/http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html Archive on Wayback Machine]</ref>
