{{Q|“Taswell” is a farewell to a friend I only met for a little bit, but they passed away faster than anyone could have imagined. It was shocking, but I didn’t want to remember them for their death, but the happiness they showed every day of their life.|C418|c418.org}}

== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Taswell.ogg]]

"Taswell" starts off as a track of echoing, ethereal music with a dark undertone and high-pitched beeping with odd static-like periods in between. The beginning samples a ethereal droning melody from "imposter syndrome", a track from C418's album [[Minecraft: The Story of Mojang#Music|''one'']].<ref>https://youtu.be/pQkV_xUgxhQ?t=41</ref>

After some percussive ticking noises and a brief interlude of echoing vinyl static and chirping noises, it suddenly becomes an upbeat, though bittersweet song, with a high-pitched piano (layered with a reverbed synth) playing a cheerful, sparse melody, accompanied by a soft, fuzzy synth playing low, sliding arpeggios and a steady, soft synth drum beat. A flute joins in, as well as additional layers of percussion and a synth choir that sings a sliding melody and intensifies in sound as the song continues.

Later, the track expands into a more intricately layered, electronic track, consisting of many layers of electronic textures that fluidly move about. It starts playing quieter static-like periods at the end. Strange, almost organic-sounding electronic chirping noises can be heard throughout the track, as well as quiet reversed chimes. The track ends with the synth choir echoing away as a wooshing synth static sound winds down and a muffled organ arpeggio loops and fades out.
