=== Mob loot ===
A [[zombified piglin]] that spawns as a strider jockey holds a warped fungus on a stick instead of a {{ItemLink|golden sword}}, and has an 8.5%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 25%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} chance to drop it if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]], or upon death when angry. This chance is increased by 1%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 5%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 40%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} with Looting III.

== Usage ==
[[File:Strider riding.gif|A [[player]] shown using a warped fungus on a stick to ride a [[strider]].|thumb|350px]]
Similar to how a [[carrot on a stick]] is used to control [[pig]]s, the player can hold a warped fungus on a stick to control a [[strider]]. While holding the item, nearby striders within view are attracted toward the player. If mounted on a [[saddle]]d strider, the strider moves in the direction the player is facing while holding the warped fungus on a stick. Pressing the {{control|use}} control makes the strider go faster and reduces the item's durability by 1 for every speed boost. The boost lasts for a random length of time between 140 to 980 game ticks (7 to 49 seconds). If its durability reaches 0, it turns into a fishing rod.

The strider's ability to walk on [[lava]] makes it a safe transport across [[the Nether]]'s terrain.
