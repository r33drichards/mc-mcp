The '''Ever Realm''' is a fictional {{BE}} server appearing in the [[Minecraft (Dark Horse Comics)|Minecraft]] graphic novel series.

== History ==
{{Expand section}}
At an unknown time, a [[The Gang|group]] of kids began invested in the server, creating their own [[Hibiscus House|base]] and going on many adventures. Once their leader, [[Tyler]], moved away from town, they were left with {{MC}} as their primary method of hanging out. The group chose to surprise him when he got situated, and promised to complete one of their personal goals: constructing and defeating a [[Wither (Dark Horse Comics)|wither]]. However, the wither had other plans, forcing [[Evan]] to build it. Although Tyler was able to chime in and defeat it, this incident made him think they bailed on their plans, and grew distrustful of his own pals.

== Properties ==
Although depicted as a server within a video game, the Ever Realm is shown to behave more akin to reality, with players being depicted as lifelike and rarely wearing in-game items. Although areas are made out of identifiable [[blocks]] and inhabited by [[mobs]], it does not appear to follow any sort of grid, with objects being of varying degrees of cubic.<ref>{{Mcnet|new-graphic-novel|New Graphic Novel|May 25, 2019|[[Tom Stone]]}}</ref> As well, players on the server are shown to possess far greater power than a real world [[player]], being able to kill most mobs in a single hit, place down objects, permanently break constructs, and even be held captive.
