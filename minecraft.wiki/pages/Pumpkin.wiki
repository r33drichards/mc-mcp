A '''pumpkin''' is a [[block]] found in [[Random patch|patches]] in grassy [[biome]]s or grown from [[Pumpkin Seeds|pumpkin seeds]], which it can also be [[Crafting|crafted]] into. {{Control|use|text=Using}} [[shears]] on a pumpkin [[Carved Pumpkin|carves a face into it]] and drops pumpkin seeds.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Pumpkins can be mined using any tool, but [[axe]]s are the quickest way.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Pumpkin|Axe|sword=1|link=none}}

When a pumpkin is pushed by a [[piston]], it breaks and drops as an [[Item (entity)|item]]. It cannot be pulled.

=== Natural generation ===
Pumpkins naturally generate with the terrain in most [[biome]]s in the [[Overworld]]<ref>All Overworld biomes except {{biomeLink|Frozen Peaks}}, {{biomeLink|Jagged Peaks}},{{biomeLink|Lush Caves}}, {{biomeLink|Mangrove Swamp}}, {{biomeLink|Meadow}} and {{biomeLink|Stony Peaks}} {{in|je}}.</ref> in the form of [[random patch]]es. They require only [[grass block]]s with air above (clear of any plants such as [[flower]]s or [[short grass]]), and can generate regardless whether that grass block has a layer of [[snow]] cover. Practically speaking, this means that the occurrence of pumpkins in stony or sandy biomes, or in grassy biomes with few clear grass blocks, is comparatively rare. Each chunk has a {{frac|1|32}} chance to generate a pumpkin patch, making naturally-generated pumpkins rarer than [[diamond ore]]. 

Pumpkins naturally generate in stem farm rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s.

4 pumpkins generate naturally in [[wool]]en tents in [[pillager outpost]]s.

Pumpkins generate naturally as a [[pile]] (and in some farms) in [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]]{{only|be|short=1}} [[village]]s.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Pumpkin}}

=== Farming ===
{{Main|Tutorial:Pumpkin and Melon farming}}

Pumpkin farming strategies parallel those of [[melon]]s. Planted [[pumpkin seeds]] grow a central [[Pumpkin seeds#Pumpkin Stem|stem]] that, after maturing, generates pumpkins randomly on adjacent vacant dirt-based blocks ([[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[grass block]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]], [[pale moss block]], [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]). If a pumpkin is harvested without also cutting the central stalk, another pumpkin generates afterward without requiring replanting or waiting for the stalk to mature again.

Pumpkin stems take around 10 to 30 minutes to fully develop. They require a light level of 9 or higher to grow. [[Bone meal]] can be used on pumpkin stems to become fully-grown, but this does not produce a pumpkin immediately.

=== Carving ===
A placed pumpkin can be made into a [[carved pumpkin]] by {{control|using}} [[shears]], which drops 4 [[pumpkin seeds]] {{in|Java}} and 1 {{in|Bedrock}}. The targeted side becomes the face of the carved pumpkin, unless the top or bottom face of the pumpkin are targeted, in which case the carved side is on the side facing the player{{only|JE|short=1}} or south{{only|BE|short=1}}.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a pumpkin or carved pumpkin into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Since both pumpkin variants have equal compost values, carving pumpkins first and composting the additional [[Pumpkin Seeds]] can increase [[Bone Meal]] yield per pumpkin. 

=== Navigation ===
Similar to [[sunflowers]], which always face east, the stalk on the top of a pumpkin always points northwest.

=== Note blocks ===
Pumpkins can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "didgeridoo" sounds. This doesn't apply to carved pumpkins.<ref>{{bug|MC-145068}} resolved as "Works As Intended"</ref>
