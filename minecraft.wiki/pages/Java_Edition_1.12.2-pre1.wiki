== Trivia ==
* 1.12.2-pre1 was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* 1.12.2-pre1 has the same [[protocol version]] as [[Java Edition 1.12.2-pre2|1.12.2-pre2]], which means these versions are cross-compatible with each other.
* This version was released on the same day as [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]].
