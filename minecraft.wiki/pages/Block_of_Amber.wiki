A '''block of amber''', internally known as an '''amber block''', is a storage block made of [[amber gem]]s in [[24w14potato]]. They closely resemble blocks of gold in coloration.

=== Beacons ===
Blocks of amber can be used to "power" a [[beacon]]. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of amber blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7, and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely blocks of amber, as they may also contain [[blocks of iron]], [[blocks of gold]], [[blocks of diamond]], [[blocks of netherite]] or [[blocks of emerald]].

=== Note blocks ===
Blocks of amber can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bit" sounds.
