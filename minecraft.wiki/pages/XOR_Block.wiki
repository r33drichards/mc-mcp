In version [[4k-1]] of ''[[Minecraft 4k]]'', the only block is the '''XOR Block''',{{cn}} having a block ID of 1. Its texture resembles that of an XOR fractal.
It seems to be a test block as it was removed in version [[4k-2]] while more blocks were added.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Since the mechanic for breaking blocks had not been added yet in the version the XOR block was added, it cannot be obtained or broken.

=== Natural generation ===
In 4k-1, XOR blocks are scattered throughout the world in the same pattern every time the game is loaded. They generate more frequently at lower heights.

== Texture ==
{{info needed section|describe the code used - can be found at https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/MC-TextureGen}}

The texture for the XOR block was generated by the game at runtime (similarly to [[Procedural animated texture generation|what was done in Java Edition at that time for water and lava]]), rather than being stored inside of the jar as an image file.
