A '''decorated pot''' is a storage [[block]] crafted from [[brick]]s and/or [[pottery sherd]]s, with the items used individually affecting the appearance of its four side faces. It can store a single inventory slot's worth of [[item]]s, which cannot be seen or retrieved by hand without breaking the pot.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Decorated pots can be broken with any tool and are [[Instant mining|mined instantly]], even when under the [[Mining Fatigue]] effect. A decorated pot drops the four [[pottery sherd]]s or [[brick]]s used to craft it when mined with a [[pickaxe]], [[axe]], [[shovel]], [[hoe]] or [[sword]] '''''not''''' enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. It drops itself when mined with anything else, including tools listed above enchanted with Silk Touch. In either case, the tool does not lose durability.
{{breaking row|Decorated Pot|horizontal=1}}

A decorated pot breaks when hit by one of the following [[projectile]]s, causing it to shatter into sherds or bricks:
* [[Arrow]]
* [[Tipped Arrow]]
* [[Spectral Arrow]]
* [[Trident]]
* [[Firework Rocket]]
* [[Snowball]]
* [[Egg]]
* [[Fireball]]
* [[Small Fireball]]
* [[Dragon Fireball]]
* [[Wither#Wither Skull|Wither Skull]]
* [[Wind Charge]]
A decorated pot also shatters if a player collides with it while flying using [[elytra]] boosted by a [[firework rocket]].

A decorated pot drops itself if pushed by a [[piston]]. It also ''always'' drops itself when destroyed by an [[explosion]], similar to other precious blocks such as [[beacon]]s and [[shulker box]]es.<ref>{{bug|MC-263554||Decorated pots always drop when destroyed by explosion, regardless of explosion drop decays|WAI}}</ref>

Stored items are dropped when the decorated pot is broken, regardless of whether the pot shatters into sherds or drops itself. Breaking a pot is the only way to access the stored items without using a hopper.

{{IN|java}}, if the <code>cracked</code> block state is set to <code>true</code>, a decorated pot ''always'' drops sherds or bricks regardless of the breaking method.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
| ingredients = Any [[Pottery Sherd]] or [[Brick]]
| B1 = Any Pottery Sherd;Brick
| A2 = Any Pottery Sherd;Brick;Brick
| C2 = Brick;Any Pottery Sherd;Brick
| B3 = Brick;Brick;Any Pottery Sherd
| Output = Decorated Pot
| type = Decoration block
| description = It is possible to use any combination of bricks and [[pottery sherd]]s.
| showdescription = 1
}}

The decorated pot's side textures correspond to the item used in the crafting. If a pottery sherd is used, that side bears the texture of that pottery sherd, if a brick is used, that side bears the default texture.

=== Natural generation ===
Decorated pots naturally generate in [[trial chambers]], with [[loot]] inside. Decorated pots in the trial chambers are composed of either four bricks or three bricks and either one [[flow pottery sherd|flow]], [[guster pottery sherd|guster]], or [[scrape pottery sherd|scrape]] pottery sherd.

== Usage ==
Decorated pots can be used for decoration. Due to the top part of the decorated pot having no collision, other blocks can be placed on top of them, including other decorated pots and regular [[flower pot]]s, which are required to place a flower in the decorated pot.

Pressing the {{control|use}} control on a decorated pot causes it to play a wobble animation, triggering a [[vibration]] frequency of 11.

Decorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as a temporary building block, similar to [[scaffolding]] and [[slime block]]s, because they are easy to craft, stack to 64, and can be broken instantly by hand.

=== Storage ===
A decorated pot can store up to a stack of a single type of [[item]]. However, it fills instantly if an unstackable item like a sword, a filled bucket, or potions are stored in it. Unlike other containers, decorated pots have no GUI; items are inserted by {{control|interacting}} with the pot or by using [[dropper]]s, [[hopper]]s or [[crafter]]s. The only way to retrieve stored items is by breaking the pot or by using hoppers or [[minecarts with hopper]]s.

Decorated pots crafted without sherds can also serve as compact storage for [[brick]]s, as they are stackable; each can be crafted from four bricks and can be broken down into four bricks.

A [[redstone comparator]] can be used to measure the number of stored items.

== Sounds ==
=== Generic ===
Decorated pots switch to the shattered sounds immediately before breaking when destroyed by a non-Silk Touch tool.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Decorated pots were originally planned to generate in [[ancient cities]], but the idea was scrapped. 
* If an item that is not a [[brick]] or [[pottery sherd]] is applied to the side of a decorated pot using commands, it renders the same pattern as a brick.
* There are a total of <math>24+\frac{24^4+24(23)-24}{4}</math> (83,100) unique decorated pot states that can be created, because each of the 4 slots used to craft a pot can be any one of the 23 pottery sherds or a brick, and each pot has 4 symmetric rotations.
* The developers consider the decorated pots as a sort of {{W|piggy bank|newtab=1}} because recovering any items stored in it requires breaking the decorated pot.<ref>https://youtu.be/0yXEhvqwoH4?t=95</ref>
