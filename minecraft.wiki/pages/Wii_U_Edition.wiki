'''''Minecraft: Wii U Edition''''' was the edition of ''[[Minecraft]]'' developed by [[4J Studios]] and [[Mojang Studios]] for the [[wikipedia:Wii U|Wii U]]. It was announced on December 7, 2015, and released on December 17, 2015<ref>https://nintendo.com/us/games/detail/minecraft-wii-u-edition</ref> for US$29.99 on the Nintendo eShop. A retail disc version was released on June 17, 2016.<ref name="WiiUDisc" /> This edition was bundled with seven add-on packs, and sixteen additional packs were also available as downloadable content. Exclusive content based on Nintendo properties was also available for the game: a mash-up based on the Super Mario franchise was released in May 2016.

The ''Wii U Edition'''s most recent feature update is the [[Update Aquatic]].

As of the shutdown of the Wii U eShop on March 27, 2023, it is no longer possible to purchase this game digitally, though it can still be redownloaded if the game was previously purchased, and physical copies still function normally. All online functionality was later discontinued with the shutdown of the Nintendo Network on April 8, 2024.

== Development ==
In late 2013, [[Mojang Studios]] founder [[Markus Persson]] announced that there were no plans to port ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U, stating that he wasn't aware of any plans but agreed that "a Wii U version would make sense."<ref>https://ign.com/articles/2013/12/27/no-current-plans-for-minecraft-on-wii-u-says-notch</ref>

In June 2014, {{W|Shigeru Miyamoto}} and {{W|Shinya Takahashi}} were asked about porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U. Miyamoto stated:
{{Q|I haven't played it myself, but I have heard quite a bit about it. I think he <nowiki>[Takahashi]</nowiki> knows more about it than I do. But I like that style of game, and I look at Mario Maker as being something in a similar vein.|Shigeru Miyamoto|porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U<ref name=MCNinten>https://kotaku.com/what-nintendos-top-game-creators-think-of-minecraft-1593839008</ref>}}
Takahashi followed with his statement:
{{Q|We've always thought internally that using the <nowiki>[Wii U]</nowiki> GamePad would probably make for a Minecraft that's very easy to play. And, of course, if we were to do something with Minecraft on the 3DS, similarly we would probably do it where it would be easier to play and could probably reach a lot of kids.<br />What's interesting is that, in Japan, Minecraft is not popular in the way it is in the U.S. and Europe, so we've also thought that, if we were able to do a partnership like that, it might bring opportunity to help make Minecraft more popular in Japan.|Shinya Takahashi|porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U<ref name=MCNinten/>}}

In September 2014, [[Mojang Studios]]' [[Daniel Kaplan]] reiterated that there were no plans to bring ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U because he claimed that the user base for the Wii U was "very small".<ref>https://nintendolife.com/news/2014/09/wii_u_minecraft_looking_doubtful_as_dev_says_they_have_fulfilled_the_need_for_now</ref> This was not the case at the time of this post, as the Wii U was ahead of the Xbox One in terms of sales around the same time.

At [[MINECON 2015]], Mojang's COO [[Vu Bui]] was also asked about porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U. Bui stated:
{{Q|If I had my way, we'd be on everything. We want to continue to be available to all players, and that means being on new platforms because everyone uses something different.<br />I've never heard a reason why we haven't ended up on Wii U or 3DS. It just hasn't happened yet.|[[Vu Bui]]|porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U<ref>https://idigitaltimes.com/minecraft-wii-u-mojang-coo-teases-nintendo-could-actually-still-get-minecraft-457794</ref>}}

On November 11, 2015, PEGI accidentally leaked a rating for ''Minecraft: Wii U Edition''. The leaked rating was removed six days later.<ref>https://wired.com/2015/11/minecraft-wii-u/</ref><ref>https://wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-11/17/minecraft-wii-u-disappears</ref>

On December 7, 2015, the game was officially confirmed, and Mojang and {{W|Nintendo}} announced that ''Minecraft: Wii U Edition'' would be released on December 17th, 2015.<ref name="Mineintendo">https://nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/detail/cus6CvrWNFwHdXiQReI7yRZl_OcGxrDs</ref>

On May 9, 2016, Nintendo and [[Mojang Studios]] announced that there would be a special Super Mario-themed mash-up pack released for ''Minecraft: Wii U Edition'' on the May 19 for free.<ref name="WiiUDisc" /> Mojang also announced that a retail version of the game would be released on June 17, 2016.<ref name="WiiUDisc" />

== Gameplay ==
''Wii U Edition'' featured Off-TV Play, which allowed the game to be played exclusively on the Wii U GamePad's screen. There was some limited touchscreen functionality, allowing players to select items on their hotbar, navigate through the Crafting menu, and more. When asked about whether the Wii U GamePad could be used as a second screen for full inventory management, [[Owen Jones]] stated it was not planned at the time, but "it would be cool".<ref>{{tweet|Bopogamel|673970645559062528}}</ref> The Wii U GamePad was never usable as a second screen. Mii characters were used as the player's in-game username. In addition to the Wii U GamePad, the game was also playable with the Wii U Pro Controller, the Classic Controller, or the Classic Controller Pro.  Like the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita Editions, the World Size is always limited to the "Classic" 864x864 blocks, but the outer 2 blocks are unusable, resulting it being 862x862. Due to the Wii U not having a built in achievement system, they had an achievement system built into the game that is unique to other console editions.  The achievement system associated Mii Characters with achievements.    

=== DLC ===
The ''Wii U Edition'' came with six of the "most popular add-on packs" included.<ref name="Mojang Blog">https://www.mojang.com/2015/12/minecraft-wii-u-edition-now-available-on-the-eshop/</ref> This is the reason that ''Wii U Edition'' was more expensive than all of the other editions of [[Legacy Console Edition]].<ref>https://twitter.com/MojangSupport/status/686129012884639744</ref>

The following DLC was included in ''Wii U Edition'':<ref name="Mojang Blog" />

* [[Skin/Skin pack#Legacy Console Edition|Skin Packs]]:

== Trivia ==
* ''Wii U Edition'' (alongside the {{el|je}} and {{el|be}} for Windows bundle and the other versions of ''Minecraft'' for Nintendo platforms) was the most expensive edition of ''Minecraft'' to date, at US$29.99.
** This was due to the game releasing with 6 add-on packs included.
*** All DLC included with ''Wii U Edition'' were the same as the [[Xbox One Edition#Holiday Pack|Xbox One Edition Holiday Pack]], with the exception of the Halo Mash-up pack, which was released as additional paid DLC for the Wii U edition, having been previously exclusive to Xbox platforms.
* The ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'' was released exactly two years earlier, on December 17, 2013.
* The Nintendo eShop did not have a free demo for ''Minecraft'', unlike the PlayStation and Xbox.
