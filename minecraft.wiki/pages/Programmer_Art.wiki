'''Programmer Art'''{{only|je|short=1}} and the '''Minecraft Classic Texture Pack'''{{only|bedrock|ps4|short=1}} are [[resource pack]]s that primarily use classic ''Minecraft'' [[textures]] from before the [[Texture Update]]. The name was from who originally made the textures, being from [[Markus Persson]], the lead programmer of ''Minecraft'' at the time.

The equivalent resource packs are built into ''Java Edition'' and ''PlayStation 4 Edition'', and the latter is available as a free download on the [[Marketplace]] in ''Bedrock Edition''.

{{Quote|The classic Minecraft look you know and love! We recently updated the game with new and stylish textures, but if you prefer more of a retro flavor to your Minecraft, this is the pack for you! Why not try both packs and compare them yourself?|In-game description of the Minecraft Classic Texture Pack}}
