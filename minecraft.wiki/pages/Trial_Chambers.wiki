'''Trial chambers''' (inconsistently plural in-game<ref group="n">
* <code>trial_chambers</code> in-game ID
* "Step foot in a Trial Chamber" &ndash; "Minecraft: Trial(s) Edition" [[advancement]] {{in|java}}
* "Trial Chambers" &ndash; in-game structure name {{in|bedrock}}.
</ref>) are underground [[structure]]s that serve as a mid-game combat challenge.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-snapshot-23w45a|Minecraft Snapshot 23w45a|November 8, 2023}}</ref> They consist mostly of [[copper]] blocks and [[tuff bricks]], and are the only place where [[trial spawner]]s and [[vault]]s naturally generate. Trial chambers are also the only place where [[breeze]]s spawn, whose [[breeze rod]]s can be used to craft [[wind charge]]s. Various materials such as [[heavy core]]s and certain [[armor trim]]s are obtained exclusively by unlocking vaults in trial chambers. As it is the only source of breeze rods and heavy cores, the structure is also the location where [[mace]]s are obtained.

[[Ominous trial]]s can also take place here through [[Bad Omen]], where [[Trial Omen]] causes all trial spawners to become [[ominous trial spawner|ominous]], making them more difficult and providing greater rewards.

== Generation ==
Trial chambers generate underground in the [[Overworld]]. The starting room generates at an [[altitude]] of between Y=-40 and -20, but the structure is not restricted to those Y levels. In fact, the majority of the structure's rooms tend to generate between Y=-20 and 0.{{verify}}

Trial chambers can only generate in new chunks, specifically ones that did not exist prior to [[Java Edition 1.21|''Java Edition'' 1.21]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.0|''Bedrock Edition'' 1.21.0]].

The generation of trial chambers follows a grid of 34×34 [[chunk]] regions centered on the world origin (X=0, Z=0). There is always one trial chambers structure generated in each region at a random location, unless a deep dark biome cancels the generation of the trial chambers.

While the origin point of the structure ({{code|corridor_end}}) cannot generate within a deep dark biome, other parts of it can intersect a deep dark biome.

{{Calculator|chunkbase|pois=Tc|zoom=0.25}}

=== Locating ===
Trial chambers can be located using [[trial explorer map]]s, which are sold by journeyman-level [[cartographer]] villagers for 12 [[emerald]]s and a [[compass]]. The maps always point to the nearest trial chamber relative to the cartographer that does not already have a trial explorer map that points to it.

{{IN|je}}, a given villager always trades the same map, which is determined upon the trade unlocking.

An online seed map such as [https://mcseedmap.net mcseedmap.net] or [https://chunkbase.com chunkbase.com] may be used instead.

== Structure ==
{{Main|/Structure}}
[[File:Trial Chambers layout.png|thumb|Overhead view of a typical trial chamber layout.]]
The starting room of the structure is {{cd|corridor/end}}. This room connects to a chamber and a section of a corridor. At the end of the section of a corridor, an intersection links to another chamber and another section of a corridor is generated, but this time it ends on the atrium, which then leads to the entrance room.

The structure then branches out from some {{cd|corridor/straight}} pieces.

=== File structure ===
All trial chambers structures found below are located in the folder <samp>[[client.jar]]/data/minecraft/structure/trial_chambers</samp>{{only|java|short=1}} or <samp>data/behavior_packs/vanilla/structures/trial_chambers</samp>{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.

=== Components ===
==== Entrances ====
The trial chambers generate an entrance chamber, which contains multiple levels and always generate a 3x3 doorway made out of oxidized variants of chiseled copper, cut copper and copper blocks. Behind it is a 3x3x1 gap, which is visible by breaking the doorway or via [[Spectator]] mode. A vault is found in a high place, alongside with multiple chests behind copper block and chiseled copper pedestals. Most entrance chambers generate a vegetation platform in the center.

| ''Entrance 1'' is a two-story room with the first story containing a walkway and over is a copper grate leading into a hidden room with a bed and a chest with reward loot. The staircase over the walkway connects to the second floor.

The second floor contains a platform with vegetation and two chests over a ramp. The gate can be found opposite one of the chests. Also, there is an upper ledge containing a vault. There are three different vegetation platforms:
* An oak ({{cd|display_1}})
* A mangrove ({{cd|display_2}})
* A cactus ({{cd|display_3}})

Inbetween the two chests and right next to the vegetation platform is a trapdoor leading into a ventilitation-shaft like tunnel leading down to the first floor, which acts like a shortcut.

==== Corridors, atriums, and ends ====
[[File:Trial Chambers corridor.png|thumb|upright=0.80|An isometric view of a corridor.]]

The trial chambers feature two corridors ({{cd|corridor/straight}}). One connects to a {{cd|corridor/end}}; the other connects to {{cd|corridor/atrium_1}}, which connects to {{cd|corridor/entrance}} pieces. The corridors are divided by an intersection in different sides, making a L shape.

Addons such as decorated pots, flower pots, candles, tripwire traps, dispensers, chandeliers, stairs, platforms, vaults, and trial spawners may generate in the {{cd|corridor/straight}} pieces. Trial spawners are either melee, small melee, or ranged mob spawners, but never spawn [[breeze]] spawners.

Some {{cd|corridor/straight}} pieces have a copper door that can lead to either nothing (a stone wall)<ref>{{bug|MC-266451}}</ref>, a chamber, or a hallway.

* The second side layer is the middle side piece which also contains decor pieces.
* The third side layer is the upper side piece, which is a copper grate walkway and never generates any decor pieces.
Most straight pieces generate a copper door in any side layer or any side.

The following decor pieces generates at the main corridors:
* A barrel with random loot ({{cd|barrel}})
* Pile of unlit candles ({{cd|candle_1-4}})
* Potted dead bush ({{cd|dead_bush_pot}})
* Empty flower pot ({{cd|empty_pot}})
* Decorated pot with random loot which have no sherds ({{cd|undecorated_pot}}) or have one sherd ({{cd|flow_pot}}, {{cd|guster_pot}} or {{cd|scrape_pot}})

The following addons may generate:
* Tripwire trap ({{cd|arrow_dispenser}})
* Staircase bridge ({{cd|bridge_lower}})
* Chandelier {{cd|chandelier_upper}})
* Copper grate platform ({{cd|decoration_upper}})
* Gong ({{cd|head_upper}})
* Ladder in the sides connecting the first two layers ({{cd|ladder_to_middle}})
* Trial spawner walkway ({{cd|open_walkway}}, {{cd|open_walkway_upper}}, {{cd|walled_wallway}})
* Small staircase ({{cd|staircase}})

Other non-addon stuff can generate during pre-generation of the straight pieces:
* A wall blocking one side of the upper two layers ({{cd|straight_3}})
* Symmetrical staircases on the bottom level, a trial spawner on the center and a destructed copper grate walkway ({{cd|straight_6}})
* A wall blocking one side of the upper two layers, in which contains a vault ({{cd|straight_7}})
* A bridge leading into a trial spawner and a destructued copper grate walkway ({{cd|straight_8}})

==== Hallways ====
Hallways are smaller branches connected to some {{cd|corridor/straight}} pieces consisting of passageways, staircases, and a spiral staircase; they may contain chests. The other side of the hallway can generate either a stone wall, a dead end with a chest, or a chamber. Rarely, hallways generate in an intersection.

==== Chambers ====
Chambers are combat rooms, larger than encounters and can contain multiple trial spawners and vaults and at least one ominous vault. Multiple potential entrances can spawn in the chamber. Some can be sealed, but only one of these potential entrances can be connected to:
* Hallways.
* Intersections.
* Corridor ends.
* Some {{cd|corridor/straight}} pieces.

Most rooms generates a base in which various addons including copper grate hanging platforms and obstacles, corner and side structures, dispenser traps and corridor pots.

Each potential entrance, including the sealed ones, generates a disposal consisting of a hopper placed above a barrel, allowing the player to sort their inventory.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1801569900885942604|If you are referring to chests being empty, it's actually intentional that they have empty chests to help you put junk in to manage your inventory.|June 14, 2024}}</ref>

''Assembly'' is a large room, by default contains a platform with a ranged trial spawner and three vaults embedded on the wall. A back ledge generates on the opposite side of the platform, which contains a breeze trial spawner in front of it. Three potential entrances generate: one high up on the back ledge, one on the platform and one on a passageway that contains a vault and a staircase leading up to the main room.

Lower structure extensions generate in the floor and contains a series of copper grate obstacles and holes covered by oxidized copper trapdoors:
* {{cd|cover_1}}
* {{cd|cover_2}}
* {{cd|cover_3}}
* {{cd|cover_4}}

{{cd|cover_5}} and {{cd|cover_6}} contain {{cd|floor_dispenser}} over them, other variants include:
* A variant of the covers, but doesn't contain copper grate obstacles ({{cd|cover_7}})
* A small platform ({{cd|platform_1}})
* Two staircases leading down ({{cd|spawner_1}})

Upper structure extensions include:
* Hanging platforms made out of copper grates ({{cd|hanging_1-5}})
* Column leading down ({{cd|full_column}})

Staircases generate at the two sides of the back ledge. They are named {{cd|left_staircase}} and {{cd|right_staircase}}.
* A ladder ({{cd|staircase_1}})
* A staircase ({{cd|staircase_2}})
* A trial spawner selected from any category, but never Breezes ({{cd|staircase_3}})

''Chamber 1'' is a tall room, having four potential entrances on each side of the room in different heights. There seems to be nothing in this structure during pre-generation.

{{cd|c1_breeze}} is the center structure, generating in every {{cd|chamber_1}} room. It is a pillar with a breeze trial spawner over it. There is also a staircase ({{cd|lower_staircase_down}}) going onto it.

Upper structure extensions connect through the upper entrances:
* Copper block bridge ({{cd|grate_bridge}})
* Copper grate hanging platform ({{cd|hanging_platform}})
* Copper grate platforms connected through the entrance ({{cd|short_platform}})
* The same, but bigger ({{cd|short_grate_platform}})

The corners can generate up to two corner structures:
* Wall ({{cd|full_corner_column}})
* An upper ledge with two floors, with a ranged trial spawner on the second ({{cd|full_stacked_walkway_1}})
* An open walkway with a platform consisting of a ranged trial spawner and a vault ({{cd|full_stacked_walkway_2}}

* The structure ''c1_breeze'' is already generated and has a ranged trial spawner instead of a breeze trial spawner.
* The oxidized copper floor has been replaced into a tuff brick floor, with powder snow filling up the lowest copper block layer.
* The ominous vault is now embedded inside the pillar.
* Six tuff bricks covers or obstacles near the pillar generates there.

''Chamber 4'' is a small structure containing two floors and three potential entrances: two on the second floor and one on the lower floor.

The first floor contains a walkway with parts of it containing a copper grate pathway that leaves a 1-block high gap of air underneath, which the small melee mobs can crawl underneath there. Also, there is a vault over one corner of the room and contains a staircase leading up to the second floor.

The second floor is a wide bridge containing a vault on one corner of it and a wall over the staircase. There are two small melee trial spawners, one near the staircase and another on one side of the bridge. 

Unlike other chambers, there are no dispensers on the wall. Instead, players can find decorated pots with the same loot as the ones from the corridors.

{{anchor|Mob spawning}}
{{Main|Trial Spawner#Mob spawning}}

Natural hostile mob spawning is disabled within a trial chamber. Mobs spawn only from the [[trial spawner]]s. The number of mobs spawned scales with the number of players in range of each spawner, and breezes are spawned less per spawner and per player than other mobs.

When a trial chamber structure generates, one mob from each of the following categories is randomly selected for the trial spawners in that structure. Every mob within the same category has an equal chance to be selected. The breeze is in its own category and is thus guaranteed to be found in certain chambers.

== Loot ==
{{seealso|Chest loot}}
Loot is available from [[vault]]s, [[chest]]s, [[barrel]]s, [[dispenser]]s, and [[decorated pot]]s from within the chambers. Players who defeat a trial spawner each receive rewards; this loot scales depending on the amount of people who defeat the trial spawner.

=== Vaults ===
[[File:Trial Chambers Vault Pedestal Screenshot.png|thumb|A vault on its pedestal inside the trial chambers.]]{{anchor|Vault loot}}{{Main|Vault#Loot}}{{LootChest|trial-chambers-reward}}

==== Ominous vaults ====
[[File:Ominous Tweet Image.jpeg|thumb|An ominous vault on its altar-like structure inside the trial chambers.]]
{{Main|Ominous Vault#Loot}}
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-reward-ominous}}

=== Chests ===
==== Entrances ====
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-entrance}}

==== Intersections ====
The room where the loot is stored isn't actually an intersection, it is a corridor end.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-intersection}}

==== Supply ====
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-supply}}

=== Barrels ===
==== Intersection barrels ====
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-intersection-barrel}}

==== Corridor barrels ====
Despite being barrels, the corridor containers are referred to as chests by the game.

{{LootChest|trial-chambers-corridor}}

=== Decorated pots ===
[[File:Decorated Pot in Trial Chambers.png|295px|thumb|A [[decorated pot]] inside trial chambers.]]
In addition to the below, decorated pots may have flow, guster, or scrape designs, which yield their respective pottery sherds when broken, along with bricks for any blank sides.

{{LootChest|trial-chambers-corridor-pot}}

=== Dispensers ===

{{LootChest|trial-chambers-chamber-dispenser}}

==== Corridor dispenser ====
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-corridor-dispenser}}

==== Water dispenser ====
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-water-dispenser}}

=== Trial spawners ===
When all mobs have been killed, the [[trial spawner]] has a 50% chance of picking the [[trial key]], in which case it drops for all players. The other 50% of the time it drops one of the other items for each player.

{{LootChest|trial-chambers-trial-spawner}}

==== Ominous trial spawners ====
When all mobs have been killed, the [[ominous trial spawner]] has a 30% chance of picking the [[ominous trial key]], in which case it drops for all players. The other 70% of the time it drops one of the other items for each player.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The idea of trial chambers evolved from [[CornerHard]] pitching in a meeting to revisit the [[monster room]].<ref>{{twl|clip=y|KawaiiArbitraryNikudonKeyboardCat-BsrnVON_L8vehSz8}}</ref>
* The design of trial chambers was inspired by the architecture of {{w|Mesoamerica}}n civilizations, whose geometric designs fit well into ''Minecraft''. The design combines the aesthetic of ancient civilizations with a futuristic feel.<ref>{{ytl|bBr8BBrk1v8|ALL ABOUT THE TRIAL CHAMBERS|Minecraft|t=97s}}</ref>
* A scrapped chamber design appears in two [[YouTube]] videos showcasing the trial chambers and the trial spawners.<ref>{{ytl|lD7twuq1AoU| Minecraft 1.21: Early peek at trial chambers @ 0:40|Minecraft|November 16, 2023|t=40}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|FpE6q0nvVjA| Minecraft 1.21: A closer look at trial spawners @ 0:30|Minecraft|November 17, 2023|t=30}}</ref> It includes a trial spawner, two chests, and two redstone lamps with levers on top.
* [[Brandon Pearce]] thinks that whoever created trial chambers in-universe seem to be "pretty tinkery".<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1819129051249872907|I think whoever or whatever built the Trial Chambers seems to be pretty tinkery - it doesn't feel much far off from what is already done with dispensers and traps in the structure.|August 1, 2024}}</ref>
* In Java Edition, if a Trial Chamber is generated in a [[superflat world]] after being upgraded from a version before [[Caves & Cliffs|1.18]], (e.g. using custom presets or by upgrading an [[Updates|old world]] with new terrain), and a [[Trial Spawner]] pedestal is positioned so that the spawner is at [[bedrock]] level, (Y:0), the surrounding bedrock blocks are cleared to make space for it. This appears to be part of the pedestal's placement behavior. 
* As of version 1.21.5, Trial Chambers do not generate naturally in superflat worlds.
