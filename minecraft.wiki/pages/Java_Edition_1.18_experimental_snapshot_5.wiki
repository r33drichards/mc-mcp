'''1.18 Experimental Snapshot 5''' is the fifth experimental snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on August 25, 2021,<ref>{{Mcnet|new-world-generation-java-available-testing|New world generation in Java available for testing|August 25, 2021|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|pbd2pr/minecraft_118_experimental_snapshot_5_is_out||Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot 5 is out!|MrHenrik2|August 25, 2021}}</ref> which makes numerous changes and tweaks to world generation.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Removed the height-based spawning change that was made in snapshot 3.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Badlands]]'''
* Slightly decreased the size of Badlands.

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Carvers can now replace [[red sand]] and [[calcite]] during world generation.

'''[[Dripstone caves]]'''
* In world generation, grass is replaced with stone (if generated near grass).

'''[[Jungle edge]]'''
* Now generates naturally.

'''[[Lush caves]]'''
* Now generate with [[springs]].
* Were unintentionally made smaller and more fragmented.<ref>{{reddit|pfui87/minecraft_118_experimental_snapshot_6_is_out||Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot 6 is out!|MrHenrik2|September 1, 2021}}</ref>

'''[[Mountains]]'''
* Mountain tops are now more jagged and pointy.
* Mountain areas and peak biomes now are slightly larger on average.
* Raised the average mountain height

'''[[Mushroom fields]]'''
* Tweaked mushroom fields biome, now it matches the shape of the islands better.

'''[[River]]s'''
* Tweaked the depth of rivers and the steepness of river banks.
* They are less likely to be super deep or get cut off in flat areas. 
* Rivers integrate better with swamps, the river tends to get shallow and merge with the swamp instead of carving through.

'''[[Swamp]]s'''
* Moved swamps slightly more inland. 
* Swamp trees can grow in slightly deeper water than before, populating deeper marshes.

'''General'''
* Small lakes features are no longer placed in dry and hot biomes (desert, savanna, badlands). 
* Reduced the number of lake feature placements in other biomes.
* Water springs can generate in more types of blocks such as dirt and snow, increasing the likelihood of small mountain streams and waterfalls.
* Reduced the amount of shattered terrain and [[shattered savanna]] biome, replacing some of that space with flatter beaches instead.

== Fixes ==
* Fossils with diamonds no longer generate above deepslate level.
* Fixed an unintentional change from snapshot 4 that made mountains lower and smoother. 
** Small hills and overhangs (3D noise) generate more often in flat areas, like in the [[Java Edition 1.18 experimental snapshot 3|third experimental snapshot]].
* Fixed an indent in the code.</onlyinclude>
