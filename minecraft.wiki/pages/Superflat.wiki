[[File:Flatland.png|thumb|300px|A default superflat world.]]

'''Superflat'''{{only|JE|short=yes}} or '''Flat world'''{{only|BE|short=yes}} is a [[world type]] or a vanilla [[world preset]] that replaces the normal varied terrain of the [[Overworld]] with a completely flat surface composed of multiple layers and set to a single [[biome]].

A superflat world can be customized using presets, which change its layers and biome. {{IN|Java}}, presets can also change the [[feature]]s and [[structure]]s found in a superflat world, and an in-game menu allows players to fully customize the layers and the biome.

{{IN|Java}}, superflat can also refer to a dimension's generator type, with which the completely flat terrain can be generated in a specific dimension. See also [[Custom dimension]] and [[Custom world preset]].

== Structure ==
In the default superflat world, the terrain consists of one layer of [[bedrock]], two layers of [[dirt]], and one layer of [[grass block]]s, with the [[biome]] set to [[plains]]. {{IN|Java}}, [[village]]s generate relatively frequently, and [[stronghold]]s can also be found; {{in|Bedrock}}, no features or structures generate in flat worlds.

In the default superflat world, the surface of the world is completely flat and at Y=-60, except for villages and other structures if they are enabled. [[Mob]]s still spawn normally. Because of the low [[altitude]] of the world, [[slime]]s spawn frequently.

Superflat worlds allow the player to access [[the Nether]] and [[the End]] in the usual ways, which generate as normal.<ref>{{bug|MC-4998||The Nether and the End are not in Superflat world type!!! It's same as Default|WAI}}</ref>

== Customization ==
When [[Create New World|creating a new world]], the superflat generator can be changed to various presets or fully customized depending on the edition.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
[[File:Superflat Button.png|thumb|The Superflat world type button {{in|JE}}.]]
[[File:Superflat Customisation.png|thumb|The Superflat Customization screen, which appears after the "Customize" button is clicked.]]
[[File:Superflat Presets.png|thumb|The Select a Preset screen, which shows some predefined presets and also allows the player to customize the preset.]]
{{IN|je}}, upon selecting "Superflat" in the "World Type" button, the "Customize" button on its right becomes clickable. In the "Superflat Customization" menu, there are two buttons available to customize superflat worlds: the "Remove Layer" button, used for removing unwanted types of layers, and the "Presets" button, used for accessing the ''preset code string'' or selecting one of the nine ''default presets''. [[Data pack]]s can be used to customize the default presets or add new ones, see [[Custom world preset#Superflat Level Generation Preset]] for more information.

If the player can understand the [[#Preset code format|preset code syntax]], they can create presets of their own by entering valid information into the preset code box. The preset code can be highlighted and copied, allowing it to be shared with other players. Similar to how new worlds are shared through [[Seed (world generation)|seeds]], a preset code can be entered into this box to use it.

The preset code currently cannot fully describe a superflat level generation preset. Settings related to features and structures are inaccessible in the preset code. Using a preset code to recreate a world can only ensure that the blocks on each layer are the same, as well as the same biome, but cannot guarantee the same settings for features or structures. When using a preset code, the settings for features and structures are based on what default preset is currently selected on the list.
* If no preset is selected, only [[village]]s and [[stronghold]]s are generated.
* If the "Classic Flat" preset is selected, only villages are generated.
* If the "Overworld" preset is selected, all [[feature]]s in the [[Plains|plains biome]] (except [[monster room]]s), [[pillager outpost]]s, villages, strongholds, [[mineshaft]]s, and [[ruined portal]]s are generated.
* Note that for structures to be generated (on any preset), there is a separate setting "Generate structures" available in the [[Create New World#World|world creation screen]] which must be set to ON (the default setting).

{{Clear}}

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===

There is no interface for further customization. However, custom flat worlds are possible internally, and can be generated by modifying <code>FlatWorldLayers</code> in the world's <code>level.dat</code> file using an external editor. This was used for converting custom superflat worlds from {{LCE}} to the console versions of ''Bedrock Edition''.

{{IN|be}}, upon enabling "Flat world" in the "Advanced" settings tab, an additional setting allows the player to select a preset and view its block layers. Presets only affect the layers and the biome; terrain features and structures never generate in any of the presets.

=== Preset code format ===
{{Exclusive|Java|Section=1}}

The preset code is a string of numbers, semicolons(;), colons(:), commas(,), and asterisks(*). Each code has three main parts, divided by semicolons. They are:

* a list of one or more [[Java Edition data values|'''block IDs''']];
** The block list is a comma-separated list of block IDs, ordered from [[Altitude|layer -64 up]]; if the entry for a given block has an "*", the number before the "*" is the number of layers to be generated, and the string after is the block ID.
** A block can also be repeated over multiple layers simply by repeating the block's ID, e.g. <code>minecraft:glass,minecraft:glass,minecraft:glass,minecraft:glass</code> would give the same result as <code>4*minecraft:glass</code>.
* a valid [[Java Edition data values|'''biome ID''']];
* (optional, '''not after 1.16''') a list of '''feature generation options'''.
** Feature generation options (described below) may have additional parameters, for example <code>village(size=0 distance=9)</code> (in 1.13+ they have no effect). Multiple parameters are separated by spaces, rather than commas or semicolons.

|-
|village
|size<br>distance
| Generates [[village]]s, provided they exist in that biome type. Extremely large size values and low distance values generate many villages tightly grouped together<br>'''''size''''' determines the size of the village (default is 1, normal worlds have this set to 0, maximum is 65535).<br>'''''distance''''' is the maximum distance between villages (minimum is 9, default is 32).
| Plains,<br>Desert, <br>Savanna, <br>Taiga, <br>Snowy Tundra, <br>Snowy Taiga
|-
|mineshaft
|chance
| Generates [[mineshaft]]s. They generate in midair if no terrain is present to cover them.<br>'''''chance''''' determines how common mineshafts are (from 0.0 to 1.0, default is 0.01). Higher number, more common.
| ''All''
|-
|stronghold
|distance<br>count<br>spread
| Generates [[stronghold]]s.<br>'''''distance''''' determines how far strongholds are from the spawn and other strongholds (minimum is 1.0, default is 32.0).<br>'''''count''''' is the number of strongholds that exist per world (default is 3).<br>'''''spread''''' determines how concentrated strongholds are around the spawn (minimum is 1, default is 3). Lower number, lower concentration.
| ''All''
|-
|biome_1
| distance
| Generates biome-specific features. This enables [[igloo]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, [[desert pyramid]]s, or [[witch hut]]s.<br>'''''distance''''' for the maximum distance between features (minimum is 9, default is 32).<br>'''NOTE:''' [[desert pyramid]]s (and potentially other structures) are not generated solely by biome_1, and "desert_pyramid" must be added to the syntax. '''Both''' "biome_1" AND "desert_pyramid" must be added to the syntax for pyramids to generate. Putting "desert_pyramid" in your syntax without "biome_1" causes issues, and attempting to /locate a desert pyramid without biome_1 enabled effectively breaks your world. This applies to 1.14+ and potentially earlier game versions. This option may also be necessary with igloos, jungle pyramids, ocean monuments or witch huts, requires testing. <!--- Woodland mansions can be located without biome_1 enabled. --->
| ''varies''
|-
|dungeon
| ''None''
| [[Monster room]]s are generated, if possible.

|-
|decoration
| ''None''
| Causes plants, ores, and similar features to be generated according to the biome type. Stone, dirt, grass, sand, or mycelium are required for most features.
| ''All''
|-
|desert_pyramid
| ''None''
| Generates [[desert pyramid]]s.
| Desert (Hills)
|-
|lake
| ''None''
| Generates water [[lake]]s, sometimes with sand and sugar cane depending on biome.
| ''All''
|-
|lava_lake
| ''None''
| Generates lava [[lake]]s, with stone surrounding them. If all stone layers are removed in a preset that enables lava lakes, ores can generate in the stone around lava lakes, given the proper [[altitude]].
| ''All''
|-
|fortress
| ''None''
| Generates [[nether fortress]]es.

Several criteria must be satisfied before some features can appear:

* The biome ID must be correct. For example, at present villages can appear only in biome IDs <code>plains</code>, <code>desert</code>, <code>taiga</code>, <code>savanna</code>, <code>snowy_taiga</code>, and <code>snowy_tundra</code>.
* Structures must be turned on when creating new world. (This does not affect normal features such as trees, flowers, mushrooms, and giant mushrooms.)
* There must be suitable terrain for the structure to appear on or in. This applies to most features except for mineshafts and strongholds.
** Villages are a partial exception; they do not form in mid-air, but can form provided there is at least one solid block layer.
*** Villages always spawn at least 2 blocks above the void.

For example, to have an 'End' superflat world with [[end spike]]s, the biome ID must be <code>the_end</code>, and the top surface block must be [[end stone]]. In this particular case 'Structures' does not need to be turned on in the world options.

Attempting to use an incorrectly formatted preset code causes the game to default to the Classic preset.

{{Collapse|tail=1}}

==== Preset code example ====
Consider the following preset code: 

<pre style="word-break:break-all">minecraft:mossy_cobblestone,250*minecraft:air,minecraft:obsidian,minecraft:snow;minecraft:plains</pre>

It consists of the following elements:

* <code>minecraft:mossy_cobblestone,250*minecraft:air,minecraft:obsidian,minecraft:snow</code> — comma-separated list of [[Java Edition data values#Block IDs|block IDs]].
** <code>minecraft:mossy_cobblestone</code> — one layer of [[mossy cobblestone]] on layer -64.
** <code>250*minecraft:air</code> — 250 layers of [[air]], from layer -63 to layer 186.
** <code>minecraft:obsidian</code> — one layer of [[obsidian]], on layer 187.
** <code>minecraft:snow</code> — one layer of [[snow]], on layer 188.
* <code>minecraft:plains</code> — [[Java Edition data values#Biome IDs|biome ID]], in this case Plains.

== Multiplayer ==
{{IN|Java}}, the {{cd|level-type}} flag in <samp>[[server.properties]]</samp> must be set to <code>minecraft\:flat</code> for a [[server]] to generate as superflat.

The JSON object flag {{cd|generator-settings}} in <samp>[[server.properties]]</samp> defines further customizations of the world, such as block layers, biome, and structures. The syntax is shown in the example below:

<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}}: The root object.
**{{Nbt inherit/flat generator settings}}
</div>Example generation settings that recreate the "Classic Flat" preset:<syntaxhighlight lang="properties">generator-settings={"biome":"minecraft:plains","layers":[{"block":"minecraft:bedrock","height":1},{"block":"minecraft:dirt","height":2},{"block":"minecraft:grass_block","height":1}]}
level-type=minecraft\:flat</syntaxhighlight>{{IN|Bedrock}}, setting the ''level-type'' field in [[server.properties]] to "FLAT" will generate a flat world.
