A '''test block''' is a technical [[block]] that is used for [[GameTest|game test]]s.

== Obtaining ==
Test blocks are available in the [[Creative inventory]], under the ''Operator Utilities'' tab, and using the {{cmd|setblock}}, {{cmd|fill}}, or {{cmd|give}} commands. When placed, test blocks are unbreakable in [[Survival]] and have the same blast resistance as [[bedrock]].

== Usage ==
Cannot be placed in [[Survival]].
When placed, {{control|use}} the test block to open its GUI. The GUI opens only if the player is in [[Creative]] mode, and has [[permission level]] 2 or higher.

=== Start ===
Emits a constant redstone signal, similarly to a [[block of redstone]], when the test starts. This block is required to be part of the structure of a block-based test.

=== Log ===
Logs a message to the server log every time it receives a redstone signal. The message is set in the block's GUI.

=== Fail ===
Causes a test to fail when it receives a redstone signal.

=== Accept ===
Causes a test to pass when it receives a redstone signal. This block is required to be part of the structure of a block-based test.
