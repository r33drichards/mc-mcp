[[File:Clouds can have different sizes and shapes..png|thumb|upright=1.5|300px|Clouds can have different sizes and shapes.]]
'''Clouds''' are graphical effects in the Overworld [[sky]]. While serving a solely aesthetic purpose, they can be used to determine directions because they always move westward.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Fancy vs fast clouds.png|thumb|upright=1.5|300px|Comparison of Fancy clouds (left) and Fast clouds (right).]]The appearance of clouds varies depending on the [[graphics settings]] used either on the specific clouds one{{Only|je|short=1}} or the general graphics mode:

* '''Fast/Simple:''' Clouds are opaque instead of transparent. They do not change between day and night. Their color comes from the top of the fancy clouds. Their smallest horizontal dimensions are 8×8 blocks wide. {{IN|je}}, fast clouds are two-dimensional. Simple clouds {{in|be}} are also opaque, but remain 3D (three-dimensional), and are not affected by [[fog]]. Their appearance is similar to [[wikipedia:Cirrus cloud|cirrus clouds]].
* '''Fancy:''' Clouds are translucent, three-dimensional prisms, approximately four blocks tall and 12×12 blocks wide. The transparency can be affected by fog and the daylight cycle. They are similar in appearance to [[wikipedia:Stratocumulus cloud|stratocumulus clouds]].
* ''Fabulous!'' graphics in ''Java Edition'' also affect clouds, being the same as Fancy, but also being visible through transparent blocks and [[water]]. In ''Bedrock Edition'', clouds are always visible through transparent blocks and water, even with Simple graphics.
*[[Vibrant Visuals]]{{Only|be|short=1}} adds more layers of lighting to clouds, making them lighter on the edges and darker in the middle. The clouds also create shadows and when a cloud blocks the sunlight, the environment darkens. Because clouds use {{w|environment mapping}}, they are always reflected by water regardless of whether they are visible on the screen. In addition to weather and daylight tinting, clouds have unique tints based on the [[biome]]. Global light sources such as the sun also tint clouds with their color depending on how close the clouds are to the light source.
[[File:CloudsComparison.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|300px|The same clouds during different time and weather conditions.]]

Clouds are tinted light gray during the day, which changes to gray or dark gray depending on the [[weather]] and the [[daylight cycle]]. During the night, fancy clouds are more transparent. Rainfall and thunderstorms darken clouds even in dry biomes, but snowfall does not have any additional effects. {{IN|be}}, clouds gradually turn orange during sunset and sunrise at any graphics mode. Clouds color {{Color|rgb(191, 191, 191)}} during [[rain]] and {{Color|rgb(30, 30, 30)}} during [[thunderstorms]] in ''Bedrock Edition'', blended with regular cloud colors for 95%, and not applied in dry biomes with Vibrant Visuals.

The shape, dimensions, and color of clouds can be changed by modifying the <code>clouds.png</code> file located within <code>assets\minecraft\textures\environment</code> within the version's [[Minecraft.jar|JAR file]]. The file's dimensions can be changed to any size.

Clouds are made from individual square pieces. The game assembles clouds by placing cloud pieces one by one.

== Behavior ==
Clouds always float westward between [[Altitude|layer]] 192 and 196. They are not interactive, and simply float through blocks and entities. Unlike in real life, clouds themselves do not produce [[Weather|rain or snow]], meaning rain or snow continues even above the clouds.

The maximum distance in which clouds are rendered depends on the [[Video Settings|cloud distance]] setting {{In|je}} (max 128 chunks) or the [[Settings#Video|render distance]] {{In|be}}. With Vibrant Visuals, the cloud distance is controlled by a separate "Clouds" slider, which has for different options at a maximum of 128 chunks.{{Info needed|What are the steps and lowest value in Java Edition and the exact values in Bedrock Edition?}} Clouds do not render with a render distance of 3 chunks or lower.

Since clouds are rendered client-side, the position of clouds is different for each player on a [[server]].

Clouds retain their position even if the game is restarted. The position of clouds is persistent between worlds—if the player quits their current world and generates a new one, then travels to the same coordinates they were at in the previous world, the clouds appear in the same position as the previous world.
