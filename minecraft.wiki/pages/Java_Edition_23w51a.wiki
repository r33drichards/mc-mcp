'''23w51a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], released on December 18, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w51b|id=a|December 18, 2023}}</ref> which adds [[armadillo]]s and [[wolf armor]] along with many bug fixes.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Armadillo Scute JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Armadillo scute]]'''
* Dropped by [[armadillo]]s when [[brush]]ed.
* [[Dispenser]]s can be used to brush armadillo scutes off armadillos.
* Can be used to craft [[wolf armor]].

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Armadillo Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Armadillo spawn egg]]

'''[[File:Wolf Armor JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Wolf armor]]'''
* Crafted with 6 [[armadillo scute]]s in a harness shape.
* Protects [[wolves]] from damage.
** Wolf armor gives wolves the same protection level as [[diamond horse armor]].
* Using wolf armor on an adult tamed wolf equips the armor on the wolf, and using [[shears]] drops the armor.
** Only a wolf's owner can put on / shear off wolf armor. That also excludes dispensers.
* If a wolf dies while wearing armor, it drops the armor.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Armadillo JE1.png|32px]] [[Armadillo]]'''
* The winner of [[Minecraft Live 2023]]'s Mob Vote.
* A passive mob that spawns in [[savanna]] biomes with the same frequency as [[chicken]]s and [[pig]]s.
* Has {{hp|12}} health points.
* Can drop [[armadillo scute]]s either periodically or when brushed, but drops no loot when killed.
** Armadillos drop scutes at around the same rate as chickens lay eggs.
** Brushing takes some durability from the [[brush]].
* Can be bred with [[spider eye]]s.
* If an armadillo detects a threat, it rolls up.
** Threats include:
*** A player sprinting.
*** A player in a vehicle or mounted.
*** [[Undead]] mobs.
** Special cases where an armadillo don't roll up include when it is:
*** Fleeing.
*** In water or in the air.
*** On a leash.
** When an armadillo is rolled up it cannot walk nor eat, and isn't be tempted by food.
** While rolled up, armadillos continuously scan for threats. If no threats are detected for 3 seconds (60 ticks), they unroll.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Added the <code>generic.scale</code> attribute.
** Allows changing the size of any mob to anywhere between 0.0625 and 16 times their default size.
* Added the <code>generic.step_height</code> attribute.
** Determines the max height in blocks where a mob can walk above without jumping.
** Default is 0.6, and the valid range is from 0 to 10.
* Added the <code>generic.block_interaction_range</code> and <code>generic.entity_interaction_range</code> attributes.
** Determines the maximum range a player can interact with blocks and entities, respectively.
** They both range between 0 and 64, with the default value being 4.5 for blocks and 3 for entities.

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Added a subtitle for traveling through a Nether portal, "Portal noise fades".

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Turtle scute]]'''
* Renamed "Scute" to "Turtle Scute".

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* <code>FactorCalculationData</code> has been removed from mob effect instance tags.

'''[[Shulker]]s'''
* Are no longer able to destroy armor stands.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Llama spit]]s'''
* They now use a new damage type <code>spit</code> instead of <code>mob_projectile</code>.
* Are no longer able to destroy armor stands.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[Armadillo]]s are now required for the "Two by Two" advancement.
* The "The Parrots and the Bats" advancement can be granted by breeding armadillos now.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>27</code>.

'''[[Effect]]'''
* The background texture of the small effect UI has been changed.

== Experimental ==
These changes only take effect when the [[Update 1.21]] experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Trial spawner]]s'''
* Now have the same two default loot tables as they have in trial chambers.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[Breeze]]'''
* Added sounds for projectile deflection, 'charging up attack', the breeze being in the air, and a 'whirl' idle sound.
* Tweaked the existing sounds.
* Separate eyes textures have merged into the head.

==== Non-mob entities ====
'''[[Wind charge]]'''
* The texture has been changed. However, the in-game appearance is not affected.

== Trivia ==
* The scale attribute comes from the April fools snapshot [[Java Edition 23w13a or b|23w13a_or_b]] mainly taken from the attribute "minecraft:general.scale" or the "transform scale" command.
* 23w51a, along with [[Java Edition 23w51b|23w51b]], was released on the latest calendar date of all snapshots, on December 18. It beats [[Java Edition 15w51a|15w51a]] and [[Java Edition 15w51b|15w51b]] which were released on December 17.
