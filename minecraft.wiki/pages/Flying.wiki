'''Flying''' is the most versatile form of [[transportation]] and is available in [[Creative]] and [[Spectator]] mode.

== Controls ==
Flying is not limited by any processes such as [[Hunger|food depletion]], which limits [[sprinting]]. Flying can be [[Controls|toggled by double-tapping the "jump" key]] while playing in Creative mode (or when the "May fly" [[Host privileges#Player Options|privilege]] has been given to the player {{Only|console|}}) and can be activated at any [[altitude]]. The player can gain or lose altitude while flying by pressing the {{control|jump}} or {{control|sneak}} keys, respectively. Holding {{control|sprint}} allows the player to move faster while flying. In Creative mode, flying is automatically disabled if the player lowers onto a surface while in the air. {{Only|Java}} In Spectator mode, flying cannot be disabled because players can fly through all blocks. Flying increases the player's field of view by 10%; it is increased further when holding {{control|sprint}}.

== Speed ==
Flying makes the [[player]] move at around 10.92 meters/second (39.312&nbsp;km/h), which is approximately 250% of the normal walking speed, being 4.36 meters/second (15.724&nbsp;km/h). This is increased further when holding the {{control|sprint}} key to 21.6 meters/second (77.76&nbsp;km/h). When flying, friction is reduced to a level equivalent to when on [[ice]].{{Only|Java}} A player flying in [[fluid]]s or [[cobweb]]s neither sinks nor slows down. The [[Speed]] effect does not increase flying speed.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-61425}}</ref>
In the Spectator mode, scrolling up on the scroll wheel increases speed while scrolling down decreases it.{{only|je}} Players that stop flying drift a few blocks in the air.{{only|je}} Also, players automatically stop flying if they touch any surface.{{only|je}}

== Trivia ==
* The player can also sneak while flying by holding {{control|jump}} and {{control|sneak}} simultaneously during flight.
* If the player flies high enough in Creative mode, the [[sun]] or the [[moon]] can be seen through the fog when looking down, depending on which is below the horizon at the time; the player can also see the clouds at this time.
* A player who gets into a [[bed]] or starts riding an [[entity]] (e.g. [[minecart]] and [[horse]]) while flying resumes flying when leaving the bed or dismounting the entity.
