'''RenderDragon''' is the rendering engine used {{in|bedrock}}<ref name="Helen" /> that runs on {{w|DirectX}} (Windows builds),{{note|Available for Win32 (''[[Minecraft Education]]''),<ref>https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/24925482449684-NO-UWP-is-NOT-The-Way-Forward</ref> and GDK (''Bedrock Edition'')}} {{w|OpenGL ES}} (Android builds), [[w:Metal (API)|Metal]] (iOS and iPadOS builds), {{w|Vulkan}} (Nintendo Switch builds), and [[w:GNM (API)|GNM]] (PlayStation builds).

==Features==
RenderDragon features edge highlighting and new lighting techniques as part of the visual and performance upgrades, and ray-tracing support. It supports a range of graphics features, depending on the device's capability.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-98861|||Fixed}}</ref> While RenderDragon has improved performance on some devices, others have experienced degraded performance.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-142934}}</ref>

=== Ray tracing ===
{{Redirect|Ray Tracing|the joke mob added in [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]]|Ray Tracing (mob)}}

RenderDragon supports [[w:Ray-tracing (graphics)|ray-tracing]] with any {{w|DirectX Raytracing}} (DXR) 1.1 compatible graphics cards such as NVIDIA RTX Series or AMD RX 6000 Series or above.<ref>https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html</ref> However, the DirectX Raytracing API is not limited to these GPUs as it's been proven that RenderDragon's ray-tracing can be achieved through emulation.<ref name="reddit-mcrtx-on-linux">[https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/14dx4rb/minecraft_rtx_running_on_linux_using_wine_and_a/ Minecraft RTX Running on an RX 5600 XT] - Minecraft RTX running on an incompatible graphics card.</ref>

RenderDragon's ray-tracing feature can also be enabled through {{w|software rendering}} with extremely poor performance. On Windows 10/11, {{w|Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform}} (WARP) version 1.0.8 added a conformant DXR 1.1 implementation that can be used with RenderDragon.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1RZWdN6v04</ref>

While RenderDragon's ray-tracing is only officially a feature on the Windows 10/11 operating systems, it is possible to run ray-tracing on operating systems such as Linux, Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1. This is achieved using VKD3D.<ref name="reddit-mcrtx-on-linux" /><ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/windows7/comments/1am5849/rtx_on_windows_7/</ref>

With the release of [[Vibrant Visuals]] on {{el|BE}}, no further changes are planned for the legacy ray tracing mode.

=== Deferred Rendering ===
RenderDragon supports {{w|Deferred Rendering}}, a shading technique with various customizable lighting effects. It is used by [[Vibrant Visuals]],<ref>{{cite_Discord

==Trivia==
*According to [[Helen Zbihlyj]], RenderDragon was designed to be usable {{in|je}}.<ref>{{tweet|HelenAngel|1164832802254143489|Only if the Java team implements RenderDragon. RenderDragon was designed as such that it could be used in the Java codebase as well just in case the Java team wanted to use it.|August 23, 2019}}</ref> However, according to [[Felix Jones]], there's nothing in it that indicates this.<ref>{{tweet|Xilefian|1369694046847983623|From what I've seen so far, there's currently nothing in RenderDragon that indicates it is usable in the Java codebase. I'm not convinced it would be good for RenderDragon if Java Edition used it, for now it's best we don't pollute RenderDragon with Java Edition's many issues.|March 10, 2021}}</ref>
