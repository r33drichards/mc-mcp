'''16w04a''' is the fifty-first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on January 28, 2016.<ref name="blogpost_16w04a">{{link|url=https://www.mojang.com/2016/01/minecraft-snapshot-16w04a/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064018/https://www.mojang.com/2016/01/minecraft-snapshot-16w04a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 16w04a|author=Erik Broes|website=Mojang.com|date=Jan 28, 2016}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Running "Searge" as the command in a [[command block]] (without a preceding "/", also case insensitive) now sets <code>#itzlipofutzli</code> to the previous output.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Added a sound for taking damage from thorns.

'''[[Weather]]'''
* Rain sounds are now more ambient/less loud and sound more realistic.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Lily pad]]s'''
* Bounding box changed again, now {{frac|3|32}} block tall and inset {{frac|1|16}} from all sides (since [[15w49a]], was {{frac|15|256}} block tall and only three of the four edges were inset).

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Boat]]s'''
* Now move forward and backwards using the {{control|forward}} and {{control|backwards}} key, and steer left and right using the {{control|left}} and {{control|right}} keys respectively.
** The boat stays in one place when pressing the {{control|left}} and {{control|right}} keys at the same time, but the paddles are moving.
* Now faster and stay at a consistent speed, unlike previous snapshots.
* Now sink when underwater, or within flowing water of any depth.
* Crafting recipe no longer requires wooden shovel.
* Riding a boat no longer subjects water-sensitive mobs to being damaged by water, and no longer protects sunlight-sensitive mobs from being damaged by sunlight.
* The player now is dismounted onto land if possible.
* Now break [[lily pad]]s, instead of passing right through them.
* Now no longer pick up mobs larger than the boat

'''[[Minecart]]s'''
* Players no longer board minecarts when {{control|used}} while crouching.
