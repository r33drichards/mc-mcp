'''VILLAGER (and Pillager?) NEWS''' is a crossover with ''[[Villager News]]'', made to promote the [[Village & Pillage]] update, telling the story of a [[Villager (old)|villager]] who is assumed to not want the update.

== Summary ==
<onlyinclude>A crossover with the fan created ''Villager News'' series, the video begins much like that series does, with several villagers holding up [[signs]] before a [[Villager No. 5|news anchor villager]] announces the ''Village & Pillage'' update has "swept the realm." Apparently, one villager is "refusing to embrace our new way of life," with this causing such a stir that the news is reporting on the harassment of this villager by several others. The citizen insists that they ''will'' get the update, denying accusations of things they never said before another villager clarifies that they "thought they might" say those and made a video to explain the new features. The citizen is confused, flatly responding "what" before the scene transitions.

A narrator begins narrating, introducing viewers to "the most villager friendly update EVER!" From there they begin listing off various features, such as [[campfires]], [[sweet berries]], and a [[Panda]]. Then they list off various biomes villages can now spawn in, such as [[taiga]], [[deserts]], "panda," [[snowy plains]], [[savannas]], and then "...uh, [[fox]]!" They then announce that "[[Wandering Trader|villagers]] all over the realm are loving life," as a [[savanna]] armorer shows off their trades. Another from a snowy plains village begins gushing about how great things have been for them, showing off the new level mechanic while a [[raid]] occurs behind them. A taiga farmer then talks about their new job, before a group of nitwits begin destroying their crops. A [[ravager]] then kills a number of villagers, another villager denying "any bad things."

The video cuts back to the original villager, who is mortified by the ''Pillage'' in Village & Pillage, as the reporter says that they are satisfied with the update.</onlyinclude>
