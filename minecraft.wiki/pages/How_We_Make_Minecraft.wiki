'''How We Make Minecraft'''<ref>{{mcnet|how-we-make-how-we-make-minecraft|How we make How we make Minecraft|November 18, 2020|Tom Stone}}</ref> is a series on the ''Minecraft'' YouTube channel where [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]] reveal secrets on how [[Mojang Studios]] make game features. 

The series is split between several seasons, each with a distinctive purpose and personality. The first revolves squarely around Narrator and serves as a soft parody of documentaries, while the second is a buddy comedy featuring Narrator and [[M.A.R.I.L.L.A.]] infiltrating the company under mysterious conditions. The third returns the focus to Narrator, who is now depicted in a live action environment.

==== Summary ====
The video begins by "daring [the viewer] join us" into the mind of [[Tiny Jens]], whose thought process is depicted unfavorably. Moving on, Narrator introduces the show, showing two villagers using a giant [[cauldron]] to cook "the delicious soup that is ''Minecraft''." Unsatisfied with the analogy, a [[witch]] appears, before Narrator decides to explore the process of adding a new [[mob]] to ''Minecraft''. The mob, named [[Mobbo]], is deemed "categorically adorable" upon birth, and established to spit [[lava]], has a kazoo for a voice, steals [[block]]s to replace with the [[Block of Eternal Screaming]], and even consumes save files. After asking why Mobbo can't be added immediately, Narrator explains that introducing such a destructive mob could ruin the game's delicate ecosystem, as seen when the [[fox]] mob was too effective at finding food. They tone down Mobbo's abilities, such as having it spit spit instead of lava, like a llama, and proceed to film six hours of the two spitting at each other.

From there, Narrator goes into endermen picking up blocks, but only certain ones. This is so players wouldn't "return home from [[coarse dirt]] collecting" to finding their home made of screaming blocks. As such, Mobbo elects to do something selfless for the player, throwing a [[carrot]] in [[Alex]]'s face. From there, Narrator explains that every mob in ''Minecraft'' serves a unique purpose, from providing food to teaching lessons, like how the [[phantom]] restored faith in democracy. As such, Narrator suggests Mobbo be repurposed into bait, being caught by a phantom while [[Steve]] cheers, before being eaten themself. From there several "kawaii" mobs appear, which make Narrator scream out in agony.

The team balances cuteness with danger, resulting in mobs like [[dolphins]], [[polar bears]], and [[baby turtle]]s having both adorable and sinister qualities. To represent this struggle, Steve and Alex engage in a tug of war, The final version of Mobbo is adjusted to fit Minecraft's theme, blending charm and menace, as well as turning into Steve with blonde pigtails.

=== Crafting a Crafting System ===
{{Infobox video|date=August 21, 2020|length=6:31|image=How We Make Minecraft Crafting A New Crafting System Thumbnail.jpg}}{{YT|7F5yx3DZLSE}}

==== Summary ====
Narrator explains the [[crafting]] system in Minecraft. When the game first launched in 2009, it didn’t have crafting. Over time, crafting became a core part of the game. Narrator compares buying a table to crafting your own, highlighting how doing things yourself is more satisfying. The crafting grid starts small, but players unlock a larger grid as they progress. [[Crafting recipes]] need to make sense, and confusing ones are avoided. Durability of items encourages players to seek stronger materials. The crafting system is designed to be immersive and hands-on, keeping the game engaging. The narrator ends by teasing the next episode about shampoo use.

}}
{{YT|UlVZgIdoR_A}}

==== Summary ====
The narrator discusses Minecraft's unique art style. While other video games have highly realistic graphics, Minecraft's pixelated, 3D design is intentionally simple and can run on many devices. The game uses consistent visual design, so everything, from mobs to blocks, looks like it belongs together. The narrator shares how Minecraft's Lead Artist, Jasper, tries many different designs before finalizing one, like when redesigning the cobblestone texture. Minecraft’s blocks have only 256 pixels, so the game keeps designs simple to avoid clutter. The narrator ends with a joke about the art style and questions if they are fired.

=== The Sounds of Minecraft ===

|image=How We Make Minecraft The Sounds Of Minecraft Thumbnail.jpg
}}
{{YT|QUfUeHRguPM}}

==== Summary ====
The narrator explains how Minecraft's sounds are created. They talk about how hard it is to predict what players will do, so the music and sounds are designed to match the action and build suspense. For example, in the [[warped forest]] in the Nether, the lack of music makes it even spookier. Some sounds, like those in the [[soul sand valley]], are made using balloons to create unnatural noises. The game’s nighttime atmosphere is made scarier with sounds from mobs like [[zombie]]s and [[creeper]]s (called "Alans" by the narrator). The narrator also explains that [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] don’t talk because they are avatars for the player, making the experience more personal. Players can use [[note blocks]] to create their own music in the game. The episode ends with the narrator asking viewers to share their favorite Minecraft sound, joking about the narration.

}}
{{YT|lIJV_f-haBU}}

==== Summary ====
In this episode, the host explores the development process behind the [[Caves & Cliffs]] update and how major updates are designed for Minecraft. The episode delves into the concept of "design pillars," which are used to guide the development of features, with examples such as the [[Nether update]]’s focus on making the [[Nether]] unique. The Caves & Cliffs update aims to enhance caves by making them visually stunning and more interesting to explore while maintaining consistency with the [[Overworld]]. The episode also discusses the balance between catering to different playstyles, such as adding visual clues for mining and new redstone mechanics with the [[sculk sensor]] block. Additionally, it introduces the [[Dripleaf|big leaf plant]] block, which can be used for creating parkour challenges. The episode ends with the host humorously reflecting on the development process and teasing future updates.

}}
{{YT|_3s14F5r8bM}}

==== Summary ====
In this episode, the host humorously discusses the challenges of surviving in Minecraft's [[Survival mode]]. The episode delves into the game's design, where players start with nothing and must figure out how to survive, especially during the transition from day to night when hostile mobs appear. The host contrasts Minecraft with other games that provide power fantasies by offering a more vulnerable experience where players must manage hunger, health, and resources. The episode also highlights Minecraft's risk-reward system, where dying results in losing possessions but gives players a chance to retrieve them. The game’s balance of deadlines and challenges is emphasized, with a focus on making survival fair yet compelling. The host reflects on their own survival journey, humorously detailing the ups and downs of the experience, and concludes by joking about being trapped in the game.

}}
{{YT|DLSeGbecKMw}}

==== Summary ====
In this episode, the hosts explore the history and use of [[redstone]] in Minecraft. They explain how [[redstone]] first appeared as ''red ore dust'' in 2009 and was later reworked into the [[redstone dust]] used today, which transmits power like an electronic circuit. Redstone enables players to create functional machines and contraptions, adding depth to Minecraft. The episode touches on the niche nature of advanced redstone techniques, which can be intimidating but are highly rewarding for those who invest time in learning them. The hosts acknowledge that while Redstone is complex, it adds great value to the game, and there are many tutorials available to help players improve their skills. The episode ends with a humorous twist involving the host's failed time machine.

=== Breaking Minecraft ===
{{Infobox video|date=March 26, 2021|length=7:33|image=How We Make Minecraft Breaking Minecraft Thumbnail.jpg}}{{YT|PfYp18pKMQ0}}

==== Summary ====
In this episode, the hosts discuss the role of cheating and customization in Minecraft. They explain how cheat codes were once used in early games to help developers test levels. Minecraft allows players to cheat and customize their experience, particularly in [[Creative mode]], where they can build freely without survival concerns. The show introduces the concept of "slash commands," a tool that allows players to modify the game, and explains how these commands have a deeper connection to computer programming. The hosts also discuss how parts of Minecraft's [[Java Edition]] game engine have been opened up for public use, encouraging players to contribute improvements.

{{YT|zj7oviDVEh4}}

==== Summary ====
In this episode, the hosts discuss the ending of Minecraft. To complete the game, players must gather materials to create a portal, defeat the Ender Dragon, and reach the game's conclusion. They explain the difficulty curve in Minecraft, which is designed to help players gradually improve their skills while avoiding too much frustration. The hosts also talk about how the Ender Dragon boss fight has been updated over time. While the game has an ending, Minecraft continues to be updated, and the true end will come when players stop enjoying the game. The episode ends with a funny moment about the host's future and a nod to the ongoing development of Minecraft.

}}
{{YT|SGsDQc7HAIc}}

==== Summary ====
In the video, Minecraft introduces a new weapon: the [[mace]]. The mace does more damage the higher you fall. However, if you miss the attack, you'll take fall damage. The mace can only be crafted using materials from the [[Tricky Trials]] update, like [[breeze rods]] from fighting a breeze and [[heavy cores]] found in trial chambers. The mace is powerful but only useful in certain situations, like when you're high up, and it's not good in small spaces. The hosts talk about the challenge of adding new weapons and keeping the game fun and balanced.

}}
{{YT|TNtgwlzeJUc}}

==== Summary ====
The video humorously explains how new Minecraft structures like the [[trial chambers]] are made. Marilla, a funny computer, and a sarcastic narrator talk about the process of designing these dungeons. They wanted trial chambers to focus on combat and have vertical space, where players must pay attention to threats from all directions. The video shows that the chambers were designed to challenge players and encourage mining and building while exploring. Testing helped them adjust features like chest placement and even added golden pickaxes to nudge players toward mining in the dungeon.

}}
{{YT|Auc3DwWpEuQ}}

==== Summary ====
The video humorously explains how new hostile mobs are added to Minecraft. Marilla, the guide, and a funny narrator talk about how creating mobs, like the [[breeze]], is a careful process to keep the game balanced. They mention that each mob should add new challenges without making the game too hard, like the [[warden]] for expert players. The breeze was designed for mid-level players and went through many changes during testing, including using the jumping behavior of goats. The video shows that making new mobs for Minecraft takes time and testing.

==== Summary ====
The video humorously explains the process of adding new items to Minecraft. [[M.A.R.I.L.L.A.]] and the [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]] joke about spying on Mojang Studios and the challenges of game development. They emphasize that new items must be added carefully to avoid ruining the game. The [[wind charge]], a new item, lets players jump farther but can lead to falling if not used properly. The team decided to focus on parkour rather than combat for the wind charge because it was more fun. They also mention balancing game mechanics, ensuring every item has a flaw to maintain difficulty, and prioritizing fun over realism.

==== Summary ====
The video is a funny look at how Minecraft added the [[crafter]] for automated crafting. It features a playful conversation about spying on [[Mojang Studios]] and working as coffee makers. The characters talk about the challenge of adding automated crafting without taking away the fun of playing the game. They explain that the crafter is meant to make things easier but still keeps the game challenging, especially with Redstone. The crafter has a face and glowing eyes to show when it's working. The video ends with jokes about game development and making Minecraft.
