'''"11"''' refers to both a song composed by [[C418]], and a [[music disc]] that plays the song when inserted in a [[jukebox]]. The music disc is obtained from [[creeper]]s killed by [[skeleton]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
When killed by any [[skeleton]], [[stray]], [[bogged]], or [[parched]] (or [[wither skeleton]] if given a [[bow]] using commands), a [[creeper]] drops a random music disc, which has a {{frac|1|12}} chance to be "11".

Because [[TNT]] ignited by a flaming [[arrow]] attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with [[Flame]], or shooting through [[lava]] or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.<ref>{{bug|MC-210303|||WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-150884|||WAI}}</ref>

[[File:11.ogg]]

"11" begins with vinyl static, followed by the sounds of someone walking on or breaking [[stone]] blocks, heavy breathing, and rustling. Haunting background noises are heard throughout the recording, resembling the ambient sound effects that play in the game's caves (and by extension, the sounds of the disc [[Music Disc 13|"13"]]). After the background noises quiet down for a moment, metallic clicking or scraping noises can be heard, followed by coughing, sounds of page-turning, then more clicking or scraping.

The background noises resume more loudly, and the sounds of faster footsteps or breaking [[stone]] blocks can be heard, which accelerate until they are replaced with [[dirt]] sounds as the background noises approach. A loud, distorted noise is heard roughly just as the recording abruptly stops. At this point, one hears only quiet beeping, vinyl static, and a hissing noise, and the track ends.

"11" plays for exactly 1 minute, 11 seconds, and 111 milliseconds, making it the shortest music disc.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "11" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "11", it emits a redstone signal of 11.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Within the disc are sounds, in order of appearance, of stone{{sound||Stone_dig4.ogg}}{{sound||Stone_dig1.ogg}}{{sound||Stone_dig3.ogg}}{{sound||Stone_dig2.ogg}} and dirt or [[gravel]]{{sound||Gravel_dig1.ogg}}{{sound||Gravel_dig4.ogg}}{{sound||Gravel_dig3.ogg}}{{sound||Gravel_dig2.ogg}}. At the time disc "11" was made, footstep sounds, placing sounds, and breaking sounds were the same for the respective block. It is unknown exactly what the character was doing when these sounds were played.
* If the .ogg file for "11" is turned into a {{w|spectrogram}} in an audio editor, the static at the end displays an image of a face, presumably [[Steve]]’s, and the numbers 12418. The numbers are a visual signature, where "C" is hexadecimal for "12", and combined with "418" creates "[[Daniel Rosenfeld|C418]]".
* There is a track that is exclusive to the album ''[[Minecraft - Volume Beta]]'' called "[[Eleven]]", which has the same length of 1:11 and begins with the same vinyl static sound before being abruptly interrupted by a record scratching sound and switching to a new, calm piano piece.
* C418 once imagined that the "monster" chasing the person in "11" is himself "being a weird monster that occasionally records songs from strangers and then dies in '11.'"<ref>{{tweet|c418|119413441793495040|Yes! I now imagine C418 being a weird monster that occasionally records songs from strangers. And then dies in 11|September 29, 2011|archive=1}}</ref>
** [[Brandon Pearce]] stated that the [[warden]] mob is based on the "monster" heard at the end of "11".<ref>{{ytl|pH_6-ZVOUAk|Ask Mojang #11: All About Caves & Cliffs|Minecraft|OCtober 30, 2020}}</ref>
* Before [[Java Edition 1.13]], the [[data value]] of "11" was 11.
