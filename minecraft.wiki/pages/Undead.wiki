[[File:undead_preview.png|right|thumb|Various undead mobs.]]
'''Undead''' mobs are a group of [[monster]] [[mob]]s, many of which are [[hostile]], that usually drop either [[bone]]s or [[rotten flesh]] on death.

== Common properties ==
All undead mobs share the following properties:
* They are damaged by [[Instant Health]] and healed by [[Instant Damage]].
* They are not affected by [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* They take extra damage from [[Smite]].
* They do not take [[drowning]] damage ([[husk]]s and [[zombie]]s instead convert into zombies and [[drowned]], respectively.)
* They are not targeted by and cannot harm the [[wither]].
* They are considered a threat to [[armadillo]]s, making them hide in their shell.
* They are part of the {{cd|#undead}} [[entity tag]]{{only|JE}} and part of the {{Cd|code=undead}} [[family]]{{only|BE}}.
The majority of undead mobs catch fire under [[sun]]light, a property not found in any other mobs, and are also able to transfer the fire with their attacks. The notable exceptions to this are the [[Nether]]-native undead mobs, which are entirely immune to fire, and the [[desert]]-native undead mobs as well as [[skeleton horse]]s, which are not immune to fire but do not burn in sunlight.
The majority of undead mobs are unable to swim and sink in water, with the exceptions of [[camel husk]]s, [[zombie horse]]s and the two water-based undead mobs.

== Trivia ==
* The [[warden]] was classified as an undead mob in [[Deep Dark Experimental Snapshot 1]]. This property did not carry over to its official addition in snapshot [[22w12a]].
* Although undead mobs share the {{cd|#undead}} [[entity tag]], the tag is not directly responsible for most of their shared properties.
** Most of their shared properties are a result of entity tags that in vanilla contain the {{cd|#undead}} tag; the only property directly caused by the aforementioned tag is armadillos considering undead mobs a threat.
