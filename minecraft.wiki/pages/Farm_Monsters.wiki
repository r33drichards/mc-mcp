The '''farm monsters''' are hostile variants of [[cow]]s, [[chicken]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, and [[wolves]] in ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]''.

== Appearance ==
The infernal cow is a red variant of the regular cow with bigger horns and an angry face. The mummy sheep is a [[undead]] variant of the sheep that is wrapped in bandages. The skeleton pig is a undead variant of the pig that has its bones appearing. The hostile chicken has the same appearance as the regular passive chicken. The wolfman has blue fur, fangs, red eyes, and ripped brown clothing. It is never shown as a passive mob as it's passive variant resembles a human in the [[Halloween Mash-up|Halloween Edition mash-up pack]].

== Trivia ==
* A hostile variant of the wolves was later added in ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'', the [[Minecraft Earth:Skeleton Wolf|skeleton wolf]].
* A hostile variant of the chicken was later added in ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', being the mount of the [[Minecraft Dungeons:Chicken Jockey|chicken jockey]].
** In the [[Java Edition 2.0#Mobs 2|April fools update 2.0]] there was a feature which made chickens neutral. This meant they would attack you if you hit them.
* All the farm monsters are based on minifigures made by Mattel which in turn were based on the animals in the [[Halloween Mash-up|Halloween Edition mash-up pack]].
* The hostile chicken does have a Halloween themed skin resembling a gray rat in the mash up pack, but it wasn't ever added to the series or made into a minifigure.
