'''<samp>chest.png-atlas</samp>''' is a procedurally-generated [[texture atlas]] used to store textures for all [[chest]]s.

== Format ==
<samp>chest.png-atlas</samp> is a fixed-width 512&times;256-pixel file that store textures for all chests.

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.15|dev=Pre-release 1|Added <samp>chest.png-atlas</samp>, following the splitting of <samp>[[textures-atlas]]</samp>.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.19.3|dev=22w42a|As an optimization to resource pack loading, everything in the relevant directory is compiled into this atlas, rather than only those sprites which are used by the game. For this specific atlas, there is no resulting visual change.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=22w46a|A customizable atlas json file has been added which can be used to control which graphics are added to this atlas.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.19.4|dev=Pre-release 3|The way in which sprites are arranged on atlases has been changed considerably, resulting in atlas dimensions being generally smaller.
|This atlas can now be exported to the screenshots folder using {{key|F3+S}}.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.21.9|dev=25w31a|Mipmapped versions of this atlas are no longer generated.}}

==== Mipmapped versions ====
{{Removed feature|edition=java|section=1}}
Minecraft also originally generated mipmapped versions of this atlas, for unknown reasons. They were not used by the game at all - only blocks placed in the world which use the json model system use mipmapped textures.<ref>{{bug|MC-276568|||Fixed}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* Were all chest textures split and handled like block textures are with individual 16&times;16 sprites, the atlas would be half the size.
