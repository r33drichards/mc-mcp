[[File:texture inventory.png|thumb|<samp>inventory.png</samp> in ''Java Edition'' {{v|java}}.]]
<samp>'''inventory.png'''</samp> is a texture file currently used by the game to store the texture of the [[inventory]] in [[Survival mode]], the [[recipe book]] button, and [[status effect]] trays.

Prior to [[Java Edition 1.14]], it was a larger [[texture atlas]] which contained all icons for [[status effect]]s. It remained a texture atlas until [[Java Edition 1.20.2]], which split off all remaining textures.

== History ==
The file was compressed in 13w09c, 1.11-pre1 and potentially 1.13-pre1.
