'''15w44b''' is the thirty-eighth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on October 30, 2015<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20151030024129/https://www.mojang.com/2015/10/minecraft-snapshot-15w44b/</ref>, which adds the [[Luck]] and [[Bad Luck]] [[status effect]]s, makes various items available in Survival, and fixes bugs and crashes.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Potion of Luck]]'''
* Gives the [[Luck]] effect for 5 minutes.
* Also comes in splash and lingering potion forms as well as for tipped arrows ("Arrow of Luck").

'''Uncraftable potion'''
* Has no effect, unknown use.
* Cannot be obtained in Survival.
* Has tag <code>Potion:"minecraft:empty"</code>.
* Also comes in splash and lingering potion forms as well as for tipped arrows (just called "Tipped Arrow").

'''[[Tipped arrow]]s'''
* Now exist for mundane potions, thick potions, and awkward potions.
** Have no effects and are unobtainable since lingering potions of these kinds do not leave a cloud behind.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Status effect]]s'''
* New status effects: [[Luck]] and [[Bad Luck]].
** Increase/decrease the luck attribute by ±1 per level.
** Luck has a clover icon.
** Bad Luck has a withered clover.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* <code>generic.luck</code>, ranging from -1024 to 1024.
** Used when processing [[loot table]]s along with the <code>quality</code> or <code>bonus_rolls</code> tag. Currently used for opening chests and chest minecarts, fishing, and player-killed mob drops.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added <code>bonus_rolls</code> tag, to give additional rolls on a pool with good Luck (or to remove rolls with bad Luck).

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[End rod]]'''
* Can now be crafted using a [[popped chorus fruit]] in the bottom and a [[blaze rod]] on top.
** Yields 4 per craft.

'''[[Hay bale]]'''
* Falling onto a hay bale does only 20% of normal fall damage.
** The highest the player can fall, and live, without armor, is 100.27 blocks.
** The highest the player can fall with Feather Falling is 169.19 blocks.

=== Items ===
'''[[End crystal]]s'''
* Can now be crafted using an [[eye of ender]] in the middle, a [[ghast tear]] on the bottom and 7 [[glass]] blocks on the remaining squares.
* Are no longer dropped by undead [[horse]]s.

'''[[Fire charge]]s'''
* Once again shoot as [[blaze]] fireballs when ejected from a [[dispenser]] (since 15w33c they had shot as ender dragon fireballs).

'''[[Potion]]s'''
* Removed many unused base potions from the game.
** For a full list, see [[Java Edition removed features#Potions|removed features]].

'''[[Tipped arrow]]'''
* Can now be obtained in Survival.
** Splashing down a lingering potion first, then shooting regular arrows through that cloud produces a tipped arrow.
* For effects with duration, the duration is {{frac|1|8}} that of the corresponding potion.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Guardian]]s'''
* Rare drops from player kills on normal guardians are returned to what they were in [[Java Edition 1.8]], namely, they only include fish, and not fishing junk or fishing treasure.
** [[Elder guardian]]s still drop junk and treasure.

'''[[Horse]]s'''
* Horses, donkeys, and mules drop 0–2 leather, affected by Looting, which is a return to pre-[[15w43a]] behavior.
* Skeleton and zombie horses no longer drop end crystals; they again drop 1 bone or 1 rotten flesh, respectively.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Entity: <code>Arrow</code>
** <code>Potion</code> (string): Potion effect of the arrow.
*** e.g. {{command|summon Arrow ~ ~5 ~ <nowiki>{Potion:"minecraft:long_invisibility"}</nowiki>}}.
** <code>CustomPotionEffects</code> (list): List of custom potion effects.
*** e.g. {{command|summon Arrow ~ ~5 ~ <nowiki>{CustomPotionEffects:[{Id:1,Duration:100}]}</nowiki>}}.
* Entity: <code>AreaEffectCloud</code>
** <code>Potion</code> (string): Potion effect of the cloud.
*** e.g. {{command|summon AreaEffectCloud ~ ~5 ~ <nowiki>{Potion:"minecraft:long_invisibility"}</nowiki>}}.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Entities]]'''
* <code>TippedArrow</code> has been removed. <code>Arrow</code> is used instead.

'''[[Fishing]]'''
* [[Luck of the Sea]] and the new [[Luck]] effect affect fishing again, and effects stack. Each point increases the weight of treasure by 2, decreases the weight of fish by 1, and decreases the weight of junk by 2.

=== General ===
'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Replaced <code>luck_multiplier</code> with <code>quality</code>.
** Formula is now <code>weight += quality * luck</code>, formerly <code>weight += weight * luck_multiplier * luck</code>.
