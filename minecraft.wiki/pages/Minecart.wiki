A '''minecart''' is a ridable vehicle [[entity]] that runs on [[Rail (disambiguation)|rail]]s and can be used to transport both [[player]]s and [[mob]]s.

== Obtaining ==
Once placed, minecarts can be retrieved by {{control|attacking}} them for some time. One attack from a [[pickaxe]], [[sword]] or [[axe]] is enough for a minecart to drop in item form, provided the player's attack cooldown is reset{{only|java}}. A minecart is also destroyed if it makes contact with a [[cactus]], or if shot with a [[bow]]/[[crossbow]]. [[Critical hits]] are not applied to minecarts, although the particles suggest otherwise.

=== Entity loot ===
[[Minecarts with command blocks]] can be given to the player with the {{cmd|give}} command or through the [[Creative inventory]] under certain conditions{{only|je}}; [[minecarts with spawners]]{{only|je}} are available only via the {{cmd|summon}} command. Each drop 1 minecart when broken.

== Usage ==
[[File:RideableMinecart.png|thumb|right|A rideable minecart on rails surrounded by wooden slabs]]

A minecart can be placed in the same manner as most blocks, but only on top of a [[rail]]. Once placed, it may be derailed by pushing it off the end of the track. After this, it can be railed again by placing a rail directly below it or pushing it onto a track.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Anything crafted with the minecart functions similar to a regular minecart, but cannot be ridden.
{{crafting usage}}

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Steve Riding a Minecart.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Steve]] riding a minecart]]
{{see also|Transportation|Riding}}

Minecarts can be ridden by {{control|use|text=pressing the "use" control}} on them. Once inside, an external impulse may be needed to make the minecart start moving. The player can slowly move the minecart forward at about 8 [[block]]s per second while riding it, by pressing {{control|forward}}. If the [[Minecart Experiments]] experiment is enabled, the {{cd|minecartmaxspeed}} [[gamerule]] can be used to change minecart speed. If a mob walks in front of a moving empty minecart, it is pulled into the cart.

After rolling off of the end of a track, a minecart can be pushed around on open blocks. If a minecart is pushed onto or falls onto tracks, it "snaps" to those tracks. When riding a minecart, if the minecart lands on a rail, the player does not take any fall damage. <!--Minecarts and arrows don't interact anymore.-->

Unlike with [[bed]]s, there is no message above the hotbar{{only|Java}} or in [[chat]]{{only|Bedrock}} for attempting to enter a fully occupied minecart.<ref>{{bug|MC-161251||Attempting to enter an occupied bed displays a message over the hotbar, but attempting to enter an occupied vehicle does not|WAI}}</ref>

=== Dismounting ===
Players can exit the minecart by {{control|sneaking}} while riding it. When a player or mob dismounts a minecart, either by choice, by breaking the minecart, or by passing over a powered [[activator rail]], the minecart tries to find a safe ejection destination for the player one block away. First it checks the eight horizontally adjacent blocks in the following order of priority relative to direction of travel: right, left, rear right, rear left, front right, front left, rear, front. A valid destination has a block underneath with a solid (not necessarily full) top surface and a space with enough headroom and width for the passenger to fit in when standing at the center. The space can even contain liquid or have open trapdoors if the mob is slim enough, and presence of other mobs doesn't matter. If no valid destination exists on same horizontal level, the minecart then checks the blocks one above, then one below. For a player, the minecart also checks for crawlable destinations. If still none, the minecart chooses its own location. Once the minecart picks a destination, it actually ejects the passenger one block up in the air and the passenger settles down on its own. Under a low ceiling this may cause one tick of suffocation damage. The air drop exists to allow passengers to land on carpet or bottom slabs.

== Behavior ==
=== Speed ===
Minecarts have a predefined speed limit of exactly 8 blocks per second ''per axis of travel''. A minecart traveling diagonally can, therefore, travel up to 11.314 blocks per second.<ref group="note">The square root of 8<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup>. See [[wikipedia:Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean theorem]].</ref> When a minecart comes to a turn it moves diagonally across that turn.

[[Powered rail]]s powered by redstone give minecarts a boost of speed. Speed is gradually decreased if there are no powered rails to assist its movement, and an unpowered powered rail slows down a minecart rapidly and can stop minecarts even on slopes.{{Only|be|short=1}} The speed decreases at a faster rate when going uphill, compared to when moving horizontally, but a riding player can still move it uphill at the lowest speed {{In|be}}. A minecart does not need powered rails to assist its movement down a hill.

Anything in the way of the minecart brings it to a stop. Once a minecart has left the track, it rapidly decelerates within one or two blocks. When mobs touch a minecart, they affect it in the same way a player would, i.e. mobs that move up against a still cart set it in motion.

If a minecart is moving fast enough, it can skip across one block without a track and reattach to a track on the other side, at significantly reduced energy and speed. A minecart's hitbox can skip turns if the minecart is boosted using enough powered rails.<ref>{{bug|MC-179971||Minecart skips turns if too fast}}</ref>

The speed and momentum of a minecart can differ depending on whether or not it is empty, and in the case where a minecart has a container, the speed can differ depending on the quantity and type of items inside.

Moving minecarts become frozen when more than one chunk beyond the [[simulation distance]] of the nearest player, but resume their motion when a player comes within range.

=== Merged minecarts ===
{{IN|je}}, two or more minecarts can be merged by pushing them into each other so that they overlap. Merged minecarts move as a collective, like a train, and can be useful for long-distance transport because while moving in a straight line, they ''do not need powered rails to keep their speed''.

To summarize:
* Minecarts can also be merged by ''dropping'' a minecart on another minecart, but only if that minecart is on a rail.
* Merged minecarts do not lose speed while traveling on straight rails
* ''Corners'' in the rails might cause merged minecarts to unmerge.
* Minecarts with ''chest'' (even fully filled) can also be merged and also do ''not'' require powered rails.
* Merged minecarts can travel off-rail at half-speed (4 blocks/second). They can travel diagonally if the last rail is a turned rail.

=== Distance traveled by empty carts starting on a downward slope ===
This table shows the distance traveled by an unoccupied minecart, in meters, on a downward slope, with a boost (or no boost). The most efficient way is to use only 1 boost at the bottom of the incline on the flat surface. Using 2 increases distance by about 20% or 1.5 blocks. All distance trends based on the height seem to be logarithmic.
The carts started from rest, on a slope Height blocks up.

=== Collision ===
Minecarts are about the same size as a block (1×1). Because of this, a ladder, door, or trapdoor prevents it from falling down a 1×1 hole. Carts on [[rail]]s also ignore collision in certain situations. A cart traveling uphill, downhill, or on a curve with a block placed in front of it, goes through the block.<ref>{{bug|MC-8004||Minecarts glitch through the stop block of a track that ends with a turn or a downward slope}}</ref>

A minecart that reaches the end of a rail up against an opaque solid block bounces back, but if the block is transparent then it stops. The minecart can even bounce against an opaque block from a standstill if the rail underneath is powered. A player or mob riding in a minecart does not collide with or suffocate in any transparent blocks but suffocates inside opaque blocks.

Minecarts are completely unaffected by [[ice]], [[packed ice]], and [[blue ice]]<ref>{{bug|MC-8265||Minecarts don't slide on any sort of ice}}</ref>; they can also be destroyed by coming in contact with [[lava]], [[fire]] and [[cactus]], causing it to drop itself as an item. The last block can be used to automatically destroy the cart and collect it (with a [[hopper]]) at the end of a track.

=== Uphill and downhill movement ===
{{Development|java|section=13|experimental-je=Minecart Improvements|removed=done}}{{Schematic|caption=The cart collides with A instead of B.|
|AB+A|-|mc-$ew+ra-$wu|AB+B}}
A cart on an ascending rail performs its horizontal movement at a higher position, with the following effects:
* A cart traveling downhill does not collide with a block in front of it, but collides with a block one block higher.
* A cart can trigger a [[pressure plate]] or [[tripwire]] above its bounding box in this process, which can't detect the cart when checking for entities. If deactivated when the cart has not moved away, the pressure plate or tripwire is immediately retriggered.
** If updates originating from the pressure plate or tripwire break the rail, the cart appears at the higher position.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Minecart shake.gif|150px|thumb|Minecart shaking due to being on top of an activator rail.]]
Most [[mob]]s can be picked up when a minecart collides with them. The following mobs, however, cannot be picked up:
* [[Bat]]s, [[ender dragon]]s, [[warden]]s, and [[wither]]s in both {{JE}} and {{BE}};
* [[Iron golem]]s {{in|java}}
* [[Creaking]]s, [[NPC]]s, and [[agent]]s {{in|be}}
This is much different from boats, which can be entered only by mobs smaller than the boats; even large mobs like [[ghast]]s can enter minecarts. In addition to mobs, minecarts can also pick up [[boat]]s {{in|je}},<ref>{{bug|MC-113871||Boats and rafts can ride minecarts}}</ref> and [[armor stand]]s and [[camera]]s {{in|be}}.

A mob is picked up when a moving minecart on rails collides with the mob, or if the mob walks into a minecart on rails. Additionally, {{in|be}}, a minecart can pick up a mob even if stationary or off-rails. It is easier to pick up a mob when a minecart is turning.{{verify|is this true or just placebo? Does this apply to both Java and Bedrock?}} For the purposes of picking up mobs, the bounding box of a minecart is extended by 0.2 (approx. {{frac|3|16}}) blocks on each direction on the X and Z axes. This means that a minecart can pick up a mob even if the mob is not intersecting the minecart's hitbox. 

{{IN|je}}, mobs in minecarts (except unnamed [[endermite]]s) don't despawn, and don't count toward the mob cap.<ref>{{bug|MC-182897||Some passenger mobs don't count to the mob cap|WAI}}</ref>

Mobs cannot control the minecart, unless they are a [[jockey]] {{in|je}},<ref>{{bug|MC-71998||Minecarts that have passengers within them riding mobs can move automatically when not on rails}}</ref> and cannot exit the minecart unless the minecart is destroyed or moves onto an active [[activator rail]]. {{IN|be}}, it is also possible to force a mob out of a minecart by reeling it in using a [[fishing rod]].

Tamed [[pet]]s, as well as [[endermen]], cannot teleport out of minecarts.<ref>{{bug|MC-3866||Endermen, Tamed Wolves and Ocelots cannot teleport when in a Minecart|WAI}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Minecarts appear to float above the track, as their model has no wheels.
* If the player views their inventory while riding in a minecart, they appear sitting down in mid-air.
* The player can teleport to another minecart while sitting in a minecart by right-clicking a minecart in their range. This can be used as an elevator to quickly rise up when minecarts are placed on top of each other.
* If the sound is muted in the options while riding a minecart, and then turned back up, the minecart no longer makes noise in the client until the player exits the minecart.
* A minecart (alongside rails and powered rails) are used as Steve's Side-Special in the crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.
* Minecart are twice as fast in Legacy Console Edition.
