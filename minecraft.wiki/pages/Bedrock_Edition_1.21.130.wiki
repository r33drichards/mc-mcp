* Added nautilus, zombie nautilus, camel husk, and parched spawn eggs.

{{Animate|Wooden Spear.png;Stone Spear.png;Copper Spear.png;Iron Spear.png;Golden Spear.png;Diamond Spear.png;Netherite Spear.png|32px}} '''[[Spear]]'''
* New weapon that can be crafted in [[Wooden Spear|wood]], [[Stone Spear|stone]], [[Copper Spear|copper]], [[Iron Spear|iron]], [[Golden Spear|gold]], [[Diamond Spear|diamond]] and [[Netherite Spear|netherite]] versions.
** Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use.
** Copper, iron and golden spears can be smelted into the respective [[nugget]]s.
* Can be enchanted with the exclusive enchantment [[Lunge]], in addition to the available enchantments for [[sword]]s.
* Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage.
** Has extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons.
* [[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s and [[piglin]]s can spawn holding a spear.
* Has two attacks: jab and charge.
** Jab
*** Used by quick-pressing the {{control|attack|text=primary action button}}.
*** Is a low-damage attack with knockback.
*** Has a cooldown between attacks.
*** Wooden spears have the fastest cooldown, while netherite has the slowest.
*** Can hit multiple enemies.
** Charge
*** Used by holding the {{control|use|text=secondary action button}}.
*** Damage is based on spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target.
*** While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
**** Engaged: The spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Tired: Indicated by the spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Disengaged: Indicated by the spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The spear deals damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required thresholds.
*** The spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players.

* Added the {{cd|minecraft:kinetic_weapon}} item component.
** Description:
*** Allows an item to deal damage and other effects every tick while in use, to all unobstructed targets found in a straight line from the user's view vector.
*** Damage is computed based on both the user's and target's velocity projected onto the view vector (via dot product).
*** The more the user and target move toward each other and align with the view vector, the higher the damage.
*** After applying {{cd|"damage_multiplier"}} and {{cd|"damage_modifier"}}, the resulting damage is floored to the nearest lower integer.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|"delay"}}: Ticks to wait before applying damage and effects.
*** {{cd|"reach"}}: Range along the view vector where entities can be hit.
*** {{cd|"hitbox_size"}}: Extra tolerance on the raycast to detect entities.
*** {{cd|"damage_multiplier"}}: Multiplies the sum of the projected velocities.
*** {{cd|"damage_modifier"}}: Adds to the multiplied sum of the projected velocities.
*** {{cd|"damage_conditions"}}: Conditions that need to be satisfied for damage to be applied.
*** {{cd|"knockback_conditions"}}: Conditions that need to be satisfied for knockback to be applied.

** Requirements:
*** Requires the {{cd|"minecraft:use_modifiers"}} item component on the same item.
* Added the {{cd|"minecraft:piercing_weapon"}} item component.
** Description:
*** Allows an item to deal damage to all entities detected in a straight line along the user's view vector.
*** Items with this component cannot destroy blocks, as the attack action always takes priority, regardless of what the user is looking at.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|"reach"}}: Range along the view vector where entities can be hit.
*** {{cd|"hitbox_size"}}: Extra tolerance on the raycast to detect entities.
** Requirements:
* The {{cd|"minecraft:cooldown"}} item component now supports a {{cd|"type"}} field.
** Values:
*** {{cd|"use"}}: puts the item on cooldown when used, preventing further use until it expires, but still allowing attacks, mining, and interaction.
*** {{cd|"attack"}}: puts the item on cooldown when attacking, preventing further attacks until it expires, but still allowing use, mining, and interaction.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" and "Upcoming Creator Features" [[experimental]] toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
* Released {{cd|@minecraft/server}} version 2.4.0.
* Added {{cd|@minecraft/server}} version 2.5.0-beta.
* Added {{cd|EntitySwingSource}} for providing context of player swings to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent.swingSource}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions.swingSource}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* World:
** Added property {{cd|readonly}} {{cd|tickingAreaManager: TickingAreaManager}} to {{cd|beta}}.
*Added class {{cd|TickingAreaManager}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added interface {{cd|TickingArea}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added interface {{cd|TickingAreaOptions}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added class {{cd|TickingAreaError}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added enum {{cd|TickingAreaErrorReason}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added {{cd|BlockComponentRedstoneUpdateEvent}}, which can be subscribed by custom block components.
* Added {{cd|onRedstoneUpdate}} custom component subscription in {{cd|beta}} with the following conditions:
** Block has {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} component, otherwise CONTENT_ERROR is thrown.
*** Subscription is not queued if the {{cd|BlockComponentRedstoneUpdateEvent.powerLevel}} is less than {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} field {{cd|min_power}}.
'''API Infra'''
* Modernized {{cd|CommandOutputPacket}} serialization
** Max number of {{cd|"Output Messages"}} are now 100.
** Field {{cd|"Message Id"}}, set max size to 512 characters.
** Max number of {{cd|"Parameters"}} are now 512.
* Modernized {{cd|CommandRequestPacket}} serialization.
** Field {{Cd|"Request ID"}}, set max size to 39 characters.
'''[[Block]]s'''
* Added component {{cd|minecraft:support}}.
* Added a new block trait, {{cd|minecraft:connection}}, to expose behavior like [[fence]]s or [[glass pane]]s where blocks connect to other blocks around them. Using this trait with the example below adds the bool states {{cd|minecraft:connection_north}}, {{cd|minecraft:connection_east}}, {{cd|minecraft:connection_south}} and {{cd|minecraft:connection_west}}.
* Added component {{cd|minecraft:connection_rule}} behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle, which allows custom blocks to define whether other blocks with connection behavior - such as fences, [[wall]]s, [[bars]], and glass panes - can try to create a connection.
* Added [[Block tag (Bedrock Edition)|VanillaBlockTag]] {{cd|minecraft:has_fence_connections}} that can be used to identify a custom block as a block that creates connections like a fence; this tag is required to create connections between custom and Vanilla fences.
** The component and tag can be used along with the {{cd|minecraft:connection}} block trait to make a custom fence that creates connections like a Vanilla fence.
* Added new state {{cd|minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction}} to the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} block trait, which enables the {{cd|minecraft:corner}} with values {{cd|none}}, {{cd|inner_left}}, {{cd|inner_right}}, {{cd|outer_left}}, and {{cd|outer_right}} to provide similar behavior to how stairs in Vanilla work.
** When this is set, you can use the field {{cd|blocks_to_corner_with}} to decide the criteria with an array of block descriptors to determine what blocks to form a corner with.
*** With the Beta APIs toggle on, Vanilla Stairs have the tag {{cd|minecraft:cornerable_stairs}} available, and can corner with custom blocks with the same tag if the block also uses {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} block states.
*** The default behavior for this field is to corner with the same block name.
**** This all requires the Beta APIs toggle to be enabled on a world and the {{cd|use_beta_features}} flag on your block.
* The {{cd|minecraft:corner}} block state is now mirrored when used within a structure.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} component behind the Upcoming Creator Features experiment.
** Contains optional field {{cd|min_power}}, which defines the minimum value for incoming signal strength.
*** If signal strength is greater than or equal to this value, then the {{cd|onRedstoneUpdate}} event is sent to Scripts.
** Contains optional field {{cd|propogates_power}}, a boolean to control whether a signal can pass through this block or not.
* Modified {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} block component:
** Removed redundant experimental field {{cd|shaded}}.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:leashable}} block component, which allows custom blocks to receive a lead attachment creating a leash knot, including an offset field to change the position of the [[leash knot]]. Only available with the Upcoming Creator Features experiment enabled.
=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
* Debug drawing tech in {{cd|@minecraft/debug-utilities}} now supports rendering shapes in different dimensions:
** Added {{cd|setLocation(location: minecraftserver.DimensionLocation | minecraftserver.Vector3)}}: void method to DebugShape.
** The location property on {{cd|DebugShape}} has been changed to read only (use {{cd|setLocation}} above to modify the location).
** Added dimension readonly property to {{cd|DebugShape}}.
** Changed the constructors of all the debug shapes to instead take a variant of {{cd|Vector3}} or {{cd|DimensionLocation}}.
'''API Infra'''
* Modernized AvailableCommandsPacket serialization. Added these constraints:
** Chained Subcommand Data / Name max size set to 512 characters.
** Commands / Name max size set to 512 characters.
** Commands / Description max size set to 1000 characters.
** Commands / Chained Subcommand Indexes max size set to 250 elements.
** Commands / Overloads max size set to 250 elements.
** Constraints / Constraint Indices max size set to 250 elements.
'''[[Block]]s'''
* Blocks that use the {{cd|minecraft:placement_position}} block trait with the state {{cd|minecraft:vertical_half}} and {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} with the state {{cd|minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction}} now update the corner state immediately instead of a tick later.
