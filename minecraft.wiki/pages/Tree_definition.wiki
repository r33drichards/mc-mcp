== Minimum size ==
The minimum size determines how much space needs to be available for the tree to be able to place. This is done by checking a square area of varying widths at each vertical position of the tree. The available free height is calculated as the height until all square are free.

** {{nbt|float|min_clipped_height}} (optional) Value between 0 and 80 (inclusive). If specified and lower than the trunk height, specifies the minimum free height required for the tree to generate. Otherwise the trunk height is used instead.
** Additional fields depend on the value of {{Nbt|string|type}}, see below.
</div>

=== two_layers_feature_size ===

* {{nbt|compound|trunk_placer}}
** {{nbt|string|type}} One of <code>straight_trunk_placer</code>, <code>forking_trunk_placer</code>, <code>giant_trunk_placer</code>, <code>mega_jungle_trunk_placer</code>, <code>dark_oak_trunk_placer</code>, <code>fancy_trunk_placer</code>, <code>bending_trunk_placer</code>, <code>upwards_branching_trunk_placer</code>, or <code>cherry_trunk_placer</code>.
