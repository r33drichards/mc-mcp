'''Builders''' were [[Steve]]-skinned [[entities]] holding [[iron pickaxe]]s that could break and place [[block]]s. They were only available in the private development version [[Java Edition Beta 1.2_02 (20110517)]], which was never supposed to be released to the public.

== Spawning ==
Builders spawn when a world is created. ''Beta 1.2_02 (20110517)'' is the only version they are available in. They can also be spawned with an unknown command.{{verify|/summon didn't exist yet}}

== Behavior ==
[[File:XperiaSchematicBeta.png|thumb|200px|The structure the NPCs try to build.<ref><code>net/minecraft/client/gamemode/secret/Schematic.class</code></ref>]]

Builders explode and respawn after a couple of minutes.

Builders were designed to create a structure for the time lapse in the [[Minecraft -- Pocket Edition Available on Xperia PLAY|promotional video]] for ''[[Pocket Edition]]'''s release on the Xperia Play.<ref>{{ytl|sW6GM6g3un0|Minecraft -- Pocket Edition Available on Xperia PLAY|Minecraft|August 16, 2011}}</ref>

== Unused features ==
* There are two types of unused "Secret Builder" entities, different from the regular Builder. Both crash the game when enabled, unless modified to fix the crash.
** The first one holds a [[golden pickaxe]] that does not render in-game. It appears to have similar behavior to the [[Monster (entity)|monster]] entity, where it walks around and attacks the player.<ref><code>net/minecraft/client/gamemode/SecretBuilder.class</code></ref>
** The second roams around while holding an [[iron pickaxe]], but is not programmed to build a schematic or follow waypoints like the regular Builder.<ref><code>net/minecraft/client/gamemode/secret/SecretBuilder.class</code></ref>
