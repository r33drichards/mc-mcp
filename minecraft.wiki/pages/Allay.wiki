An '''allay''' <!-- ({{Audio|AllayPronunciation.mp3|/əˈleɪ/|link2=''uh-ʟᴀʏ''}}) -->is a small flying [[passive mob]] that follows the [[player]] who has {{Control|use|text=given it}} an [[item]], or any [[note block]] instrument it has heard in the last 30 seconds. It collects [[Item (entity)|dropped instances]] of its held item and drops them near the player or note block it is currently following.

== Spawning ==
[[File:Two Allays Pillager Outpost.png|thumb|right|Two allays in a cage near a pillager outpost.]]
[[File:Two allays.png|thumb|right|Two allays inside a woodland mansion cell.]]
Allays spawn only during [[Seed (world generation)|world generation]], but they can also be duplicated; see {{Section link||Allay duplication}} below.

Allays have a 50% chance of [[Mob spawning|spawn]]ing in dark oak cages near [[pillager outpost]]s in groups of 1-3.
Allays also have a 50% chance to spawn inside jail cells within [[woodland mansion]]s in groups of 1-3.

== Drops ==
Upon death, allays drop the item they are holding. Besides this, allays drop no other items or experience.

== Behavior ==
The allay's luminous texture allows it to be seen clearly in the dark, although it doesn't illuminate its surroundings. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], allays are emissive and have a blue glow in the dark.

The allay is small, peaceful, and flies aimlessly until a player gives it an [[item]] with their {{control|use}} key. The allay starts following the player and seeks out dropped versions of the same item to deliver them to the player. The allay returns to wandering around if any player takes its item back by {{control|using}} an empty hand on it.

The allay locks onto the player who last gave it an item. This allay follows the player from up to a 64-block cubic area away and seeks items up to a 32-block cubic area away from the player. After delivering items, the allay has a delay of three seconds until it can seek items again. An allay has a single inventory slot to hold a [[Inventory#Slots|stack of items]] (usually 64 items) in addition to the item it got from the player. While the allay does not discern [[enchantment]]s, [[Anvil mechanics#Renaming|special item names]], or items in [[shulker box]]es when it seeks, it still carries such items in separate trips.

Allays don't pick up any items if the [[game rule]] {{cmd|gamerule ''mobGriefing''}} is {{Cd|false}}, but the player can still give the allay items with the {{Control|use}} key. 

If the allay hears a [[note block]] play within 16 blocks of its location while delivering items, it instead delivers its items to the note block. Then it spends 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. The allay returns to targeting its player after 30 seconds. A [[Particles#vibration|vibration particle]] emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate that the allay has locked onto the note block. While an allay is focused on a note block, it responds only to sound from that note block, which resets the time until the allay loses interest. This in principle allows allays to focus on a single note block while other note blocks are playing in the vicinity, thus allowing many allays to work in parallel with different note blocks. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing [[wool]] between the note block and the allay can prevent this sound [[Sculk Sensor#Vibration detection|interaction]]. 

The allay can pick up items within a radius of about 1.3 blocks from itself and drop items up to 3 blocks away from its player or note block.

An allay performs a dance animation when there is a nearby [[jukebox]] playing. If the jukebox stops playing or if the allay gets too far away from the jukebox, it stops dancing.

The allay cannot enter water, although it attempts to gather underwater items. 

Allays cannot be harmed by their interacting owners. If they are harmed by another source, they fly away for a few seconds. When killed, allays drop the items they were holding. If an allay dies while holding a [[totem of undying]], it instead returns to full health and the totem is destroyed, as with any mob holding a totem of undying. Allays naturally regenerate {{hp|2}} per second if damaged.

{{IN|Java}}, {{Control|using}} a named [[name tag]] performs the item's normal function, and it's impossible to give it to the allay. However, tethering allay to a fence {{Control|using}} a [[lead]] will allow the player to give it to it. {{IN|Bedrock}}, {{Control|using}} a lead or a named name tag gives it to the allay, and the player can trigger the item's normal function by {{Control|sneaking}}.

Despite being flying mobs, allays can destroy [[turtle egg]]s when on top of them.<ref>{{bug|MC-248332||Bees, ghasts, phantoms, and allays can destroy turtle eggs}}</ref>

=== Allay duplication ===
[[File:Allay breeding.png|thumb|An allay duplicating.]]
If an allay is given an [[amethyst shard]] while it is dancing due to a nearby [[jukebox]] playing any [[music disc]], it splits into two allays (itself and a new allay) and the amethyst shard is consumed. After duplication, both allays have a five-minute cooldown before being able to duplicate again. Allays do not have a baby form.

When the duplication occurs, the second allay is freshly spawned in the same location as the allay being given the amethyst shard; it doesn't retain the original allay's attributes such as its custom name or attributes set via the use of [[commands]].

=== Teleportation ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
When a player teleports through a [[nether portal]], the player's allay teleports to them, even if it does not enter the portal.

When a player teleports through an [[end portal]], the allay teleports to [[the End]] only if a player gives the allay an item before teleporting and must be nearby the player as they teleport.

Allays holding an item follow the player through a portal if they are 21 blocks horizontally from the player or if they are within 22 blocks vertically of the player's legs. Allays do not travel through portals regardless of how close they are if they are tethered to a fence with a [[lead]].

{{Issue list}}

== Trivia == 
* The allay was originally planned for the [[Nether Update]].<ref name="TSM Allay">{{ytl|IXu7yKUmBEw|The Secrets of Minecraft: The Allay|Minecraft|Mar 29, 2022}}</ref>
* Some previous names considered for the allay were the wisp and the pixie.<ref name="TSM Allay">{{ytl|IXu7yKUmBEw|The Secrets of Minecraft: The Allay|Minecraft|Mar 29, 2022}}</ref>
* The allays were created to solve the problem of how players would build structures and collect resources in {{MCL}} while focusing on defending the Overworld.<ref>{{ytl|iM9KtHaDcUg|Minecraft Live 2022 @ 57:19|Minecraft|October 15, 2022|t=3439}}</ref>
* The reason why allay duplication uses amethyst shards is because the item is renewable, has a musical sound that fits with the allay, and it adds more value to [[amethyst geode]]s.<ref>{{Tweet|Badgerisi|1534925174394564615|Seen some questions as to why we landed om amethyst shards as the item for Allay duplication * They have a musical sound to them, which goes well with Allays * They are renewable, something we really wanted * The magical feeling of them resonates (pun intended) well with Allays|June 9, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|Badgerisi|1534925320784052224|Also, adding extra value to the Geodes felt proper as well|June 9, 2022}}</ref>
* According to the Meet the Allay article on [[Minecraft.net]], the reason why allays can be tamed by players is because they form a "magical connection" when that player gives it an item. This bond is what prevents players from accidentally harming their allay.<ref name="meet-allay">{{mcnet|meet-allay|Meet the Allay|May 27, 2022|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
* Originally, Mojang considered having allays naturally spawn within [[forest]] biomes. However, the reason they went with [[pillager outpost]]s and [[woodland mansion]]s, was because they wanted to highlight the companionship aspect.<ref name="meet-allay"/>
