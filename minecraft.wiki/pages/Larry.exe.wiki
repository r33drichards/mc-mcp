}}'''Larry.exe''' is a [[computer]] appearing in the [[Ice Cube Claims Adjuster]] series, running off "DeniedOS."<ref>{{Tweet|Minecraft|1956079958314635335|Gotta lock in next time because that claim is DENIED}}</ref>

== Appearance ==
Larry is an archaic computer model, evocative of the 1990s , with a large CRT monitor, yellowish white exterior, and a visible floppy disk drive. Below the monitor, three sticky notes can be seen. In the middle is one saying to "deny all claims," which is a running gag throughout the series, while another says Case #017265. A third, green note can be seen, but ineligible.{{More info}} The computer is personified by an approximately 20 × 17 file running on an operating system resembling {{Wikipedia|Windows 95}}. Within the window is a vaguely humanoid head shape, with visible ears made of two pixels, eyes shaped like asterisks or Xs, and a long mouth.

Behind the face is a wallpaper, seemingly referencing the classic wallpaper {{Wikipedia|Bliss (photograph)|Bliss}}, only recreated using [[short grass]] and [[moss block]]s.

== Personality ==
From what is shown, Larry is rather obedient, appearing at [[Ice Cube]]'s beck and call. However, they remain independent and show occasional opposition to orders. When forced to read out gibberish typed out by Ice Cube, they show subtle signs of pain and discomfort, and another time ask for respect directly.

== Properties ==
For a seemingly outdated computer, Larry is quite advanced, being able to recognize voice commands, read out text, and pull up instantaneous vmails. In spite of this power, it's been shown to glitch out and require force to realign. It is also implied to hold some sort of supernatural power, making a teleporting sound when appearing. On the desktop of the computer, it can hold at least seven folders, and can presumably be used to play {{MC}}.
