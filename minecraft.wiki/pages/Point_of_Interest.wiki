{{Missing information|POIs in ''Bedrock Edition''}}

'''Point of interest''' refers to particularly important [[blocks]] in the game. In the game, there is a dedicated space that saves only the location of points of interest, separate from the data for other blocks in the world, allowing quicker access to these points.

It is also sometimes referred to as '''POI''', an abbreviation for '''p'''oint '''o'''f '''i'''nterest.

== Mechanism ==
Points of interest are used by some [[entities]], [[items]], and [[blocks]]. They are saved as mca files in the Level format folders (the folder that stores world data inside the saves folder):
* <code>poi</code> folder (for the [[Overworld]])
* <code>DIM-1\poi</code> folder (for the [[Nether]])
* <code>DIM1\poi</code> folder (for the [[End]])

=== ID ===
* Each point of interest is assigned an ID. The ID does not necessarily match the block's ID; for example, a [[bed]] is <code>minecraft:home</code>.

* The ID saved in the mca files corresponds to the point of interest, and the block's ID is not saved. The IDs are listed in the table below.

=== free_tickets ===
* Each point of interest has a maximum number of entities that can be associated with it at the same time. The maximum number for each point of interest is shown in the table below.

* The number of available slots is stored in a value called <code>free_tickets</code> for each point of interest. For example, a [[Bell]] can be associated with up to 32 [[Villagers]]. If twelve Villagers are already associated with it, the value of <code>free_tickets</code> will be twenty. For blocks like the [[Nether Portal (block)|Nether Portal]], which cannot be associated with entities, the value is always set to 0.
