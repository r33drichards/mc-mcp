This article is about the '''mechanics of [[food]]''', including eating, hunger, saturation, exhaustion, and status effects. The mechanics of food are exclusively used by [[player]]s.

== Eating ==
[[File:Consumption time.gif|thumb|The consumption time difference between a honey bottle (2 seconds), bread (1.6 seconds), and dried kelp (0.8 seconds).]]
Eating is the process of consuming food items. Eating a food item requires holding {{control|use}}, and takes an amount of time dependent on the food's consumption time value.

=== Consumption time ===
Eating (or drinking) a consumable takes {{convert|32|gt|s}}, with the exceptions of [[dried kelp]] which takes half of the time ({{convert|16|gt|s}}), and [[honey bottle]]s which take 25% longer ({{convert|40|gt|s}}). [[Cake]] is a [[block]] and thus cannot be eaten in the hand, requiring the player to place it down and then {{control|use}} it.

=== Eating while at full hunger ===
In [[Survival]], food cannot be eaten while already at full hunger, with the exception of [[chorus fruit]], [[golden apple]]s, [[enchanted golden apple]]s, [[honey bottle]]s, and [[suspicious stew]]. This also applies to [[potion]]s, [[water bottle]]s, and [[milk bucket]]s. In [[Creative]] mode and Peaceful [[difficulty]]{{only|be}}, any food can be consumed at any time.

== Hunger ==
{{Redirect|Hunger|the status effect|Hunger (effect)}}
Hunger is a value that determines [[healing]], whether or not the player can [[sprint]], and whether or not the player is starving. Hunger is restored by eating food items. Hunger is lost by healing or by performing [[#Energy-intensive actions|energy-intensive actions]] that exhaust the player, and is the second value to be consumed by it, after [[#Saturation|saturation]].

The player's current hunger value is represented by the hunger bar ({{hunger|bar=20}}), which displays above the [[hotbar]] on the right side, opposite of the [[health bar]]. Each hunger point is represented by half a hunger icon ({{hunger|1|notag=1}}), and the maximum hunger value is 20. Hunger points can also be restored by applying the [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]] status effect. The hunger value does not drain on [[Peaceful]] difficulty, and always remains at the maximum value of 20.

=== Natural regeneration ===
[[File:Natural regeneration.gif|thumb|Gaining natural regeneration by being at {{hunger|bar=18}} or above.]]
If the hunger value is at 18 ({{hunger|bar=18}}) or above, or the saturation value is non-zero, the player's health naturally regenerates every 4 seconds (80 ticks). Saturation is used first, and then once fully drained, hunger is used instead. When the hunger value drops to 17 ({{hunger|bar=17}}) or below, natural regeneration stops.

=== Sprinting ===
{{main|Sprinting#Activating}}
If the hunger value is at 6 ({{hunger|bar=6}}) or below, the player loses the ability to [[sprint]].

=== Starvation ===
[[File:Starvation.gif|thumb|Taking starvation damage due to being at {{hunger|bar=0}}.]]
If the hunger value reaches 0 ({{hunger|bar=0}}), the player will begin to lose health due to starvation. Starvation damages the player by {{hp|1}} every 4 seconds (80 ticks). Starvation damage ignores [[armor]] and [[armor toughness]], the [[Protection]] enchantment, and the [[Resistance]] effect.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|111047534318858240|If the the food bar is empty in MC 1.8, it will slowly drop your health to 5 hearts on easy, to 0.5 hearts on normal, and kill you on hard|September 6, 2011}}</ref> Starvation damage stops taking effect when reaching certain health thresholds on certain [[difficulties]].
* On Easy difficulty, starvation damage stops when the player's health is at {{hp|10|total=20}} or below.
* On Normal difficulty, starvation damage stops when the player's health is at {{hp|1|total=20}} or below.
* On Hard difficulty, starvation damage does not stop at any health threshhold, and will kill the player by bringing them to {{hp|0|total=20}}.

== Saturation ==
{{Redirect|Saturation|the status effect|Saturation (effect)}}
Saturation is a value that determines healing, as well as the time until hunger begins to deplete. Saturation is lost by healing or performing [[energy-intensive actions]] that exhaust the player, and is the first value to be consumed by it, before [[Food mechanics#Hunger|hunger]].

The player's current saturation value is not visually displayed as a bar, unlike the hunger value. Instead, when saturation reaches zero, the hunger bar starts to shake or jitter periodically.

=== Saturation boost ===
[[File:Saturation boost.gif|thumb|Gaining saturation boost from reaching full hunger, consuming the saturation gained from the [[cooked porkchop]] to heal.]]
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Saturation boost<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/epy4hv/experimental_combat_snapshot_version_5/|title=Experimental Combat Snapshot - version 5|section=|website=[https://www.reddit.com/ Reddit - the heart of the internet]|author=[[Jeb]]|date=January 16, 2020|quote=…food rebalance: Saturation boost…|archive-url=}}</ref> is a mechanic exclusive to {{JE}} that regenerates health when the player's hunger bar is full ({{Hungerbar|20|9px}}). Saturation boost heals {{hp|1}} and consumes {{hunger|1.5}} saturation points every 0.5 seconds (10 ticks).

== Exhaustion ==
Exhaustion is incurred from doing certain energy-intensive actions, and certain actions exhaust the player more than others. Exhaustion first reduces saturation, and then reduces hunger.

Once the exhaustion level reaches 4.0, it resets to 0.0 and reduces the saturation by {{hunger|1}} if there is any saturation remaining. If the saturation is 0, it reduces the hunger by {{hunger|1}} instead.

== Effects ==
[[File:Eating Rotten Flesh.png|thumb|right|Getting the [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] effect from eating [[rotten flesh]].]]
Certain foods provide additional effects when eaten, both helpful and harmful. This can come in the form of gaining [[status effect]]s, clearing status effects, or teleportation.

* [[Chorus fruit]]s teleport the player [[Enderman#Teleportation|randomly]].
* [[Enchanted golden apple]]s provide [[Regeneration]] II for 20 seconds{{only|java}} or 30 seconds{{only|bedrock}}, [[Absorption]] IV for 2 minutes, [[Resistance]] I for 5 minutes, and [[Fire Resistance]] for 5 minutes.
* [[Golden apple]]s provide Regeneration II for 5 seconds and Absorption I for 2 minutes.
* [[Honey bottle]]s clear [[Poison]].
* [[Milk bucket]]s clear all [[status effect]]s.
* [[Poisonous potato]]es have a 60% chance to inflict Poison for 5 seconds.
* [[Pufferfish]] inflict [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] III for 15 seconds, [[Nausea]] for 15 seconds, and Poison II for 1 minute.
* [[Raw chicken]] has a 30% chance to inflict Hunger I for 30 seconds.
* [[Rotten flesh]] has an 80% chance to inflict Hunger I for 30 seconds.
* [[Spider eye]]s inflict Poison I for 5 seconds.
* [[Suspicious stew]]s inflict an effect dependent on the [[Suspicious Stew#Food|type of stew]].

=== Hunger effect ===
{{main|Hunger (effect)}}
The [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] effect removes {{hunger|1}} hunger or {{hunger|1}} saturation point every <math>\frac{40}\text{level}</math> seconds, and turns the hunger bar to a green color ({{hungerbar|20|9px|poisoned=1}}). It is inflicted by being attacked by a [[husk]], or by eating [[Pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]], [[rotten flesh]], or [[raw chicken]].

=== Saturation effect ===
{{main|Saturation (effect)}}
The [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]] effect replenishes {{hunger|1}} hunger point and {{hunger|2}} saturation points every 0.05 seconds (1 tick){{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-52353||Saturation status effect does not restore saturation points}}</ref> per level. It is applied exclusively through [[suspicious stew]] crafted with a [[blue orchid]] or [[dandelion]].

== Internal variables ==
Food mechanics utilize four variables, the values of which are stored in the [[player.dat format]]. Variables can be queried in-game with the following command: {{cmd|data get entity <player's name> <variable>}}{{only|je}}.
*<code>foodLevel</code>: The player's current hunger level, shown on the hunger bar. Its initial value on [[world]] creation or respawn is {{hunger|20}}.
*<code>foodSaturationLevel</code>: The player's current saturation level, which determines how fast <code>foodLevel</code> depletes and is controlled by the kinds of food the player has eaten. Its maximum value always equals <code>foodLevel</code>'s value and decreases with <code>foodLevel</code>. Its initial value on world creation or respawn is 5.
*<code>foodTickTimer</code>: This variable is used when <code>foodLevel</code> either exceeds 17 ({{hunger|bar=17}}), or is at zero. It increases on every [[tick]], and whenever it reaches 80 (4 seconds), it resets to zero and {{hp|1}} is added or deducted, depending on whether the player is saturated or starving. If the player has a full {{hunger|20}}, {{frac|1|6}} of {{hp|1}} times the player's <code>foodSaturationLevel</code> is restored, up to a maximum of {{hp|1}}, when <code>foodTickTimer</code> reaches 10 ({{frac|1|2}} second), and <code>foodTickTimer</code> is reset to zero.
*<code>foodExhaustionLevel</code>: The player's current exhaustion level, which determines how fast the <code>foodSaturationLevel</code> depletes. Its value is increased by the player's actions (see [[#Exhaustion level increase|Exhaustion level increase]] for specific values). The initial value is zero. When it reaches a value of at least 4, the total value is decreased by 4 and one point is subtracted from <code>foodSaturationLevel</code>, or <code>foodLevel</code> if <code>foodSaturationLevel</code> is at zero.
