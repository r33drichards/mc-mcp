This is a list of features which were broken by 12w18a's client-server logic split which remained broken into the full release of 1.3.1. As a relatively large number of things were affected by this change, and in many cases the differences are subtle or difficult to notice at a glance, this page serves to demonstrate these behaviors in more detail than is typically provided by the regular changelog.

== Summary ==

Note that due to the nature of these bugs, all of the features listed here only functioned in singleplayer prior to 12w18a &ndash; the reason they broke in the first place is because singleplayer was changed to use multiplayer logic internally and these features were not accounted for. Likewise, features that have since been fixed now function in both singleplayer and multiplayer.

== Still broken features ==
=== Specialized loading text ===
Loading screens would originally change their upper line of text to be specialized to the action that was being performed. When entering the Nether or End, the screen would respectively display "Entering the Nether" or "Entering the End". Leaving either dimension would display "Leaving the Nether" or "Leaving the End". Respawning after death would display "Respawning", while deleting the world after dying in [[Hardcore]] mode would display "Deleting world". All of these no longer occur since 12w18a. In [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], dimension backgrounds were added to distinguish the Nether or End dimension teleports, but the text has yet to be restored and there is still no loading screen displayed when respawning.

As Hardcore mode no longer deletes the world on death, the loading text for that can arguably be considered "fixed" by technicality &ndash; although no corresponding text is displayed for spectating the world either.

=== Notch dropping an apple on death ===
Prior to 12w18a, any player named "[[Notch]]" would drop an [[apple]] along with their inventory when killed in singleplayer. This no longer happens, and their inventory will simply be dropped as normal.

In the years since, Mojang has distanced themselves from Notch and removed most references to him from the game, following controversial statements he made on Twitter. Despite this, the associated bug tracker issue remains open.

=== Mob construction particles ===
When a [[snow golem]] was built, along with the snow golem, a cloak of snowflake particles would also be generated around it. Similarly, when building an [[iron golem]], a burst of [[snowball]]-textured particles would also be created at the instant of its spawning. In 12w18a, these particles would no longer appear at all, and the mobs would just phase into existence with no further effects.

When the [[wither]] was made spawnable, its spawning code also made it create snowball particles in much the same way that iron golems would. Being introduced after 12w18a, the particles produced by them never ended up able to be seen.{{Citation needed}}

In [[Java Edition 17w47a|17w47a]], due to changes to the breaking of blocks, particles would again be generated upon the creation of the golems and for the first time ever the wither. However, these particles are functionally and fundamentally different &ndash; where the particles were themed for the mob at first, these particles were simply the result of the constituent blocks being broken by the game, and as such were block breaking particles using the textures of the blocks in question.<ref>{{bug|MC-123338}}</ref> The actual particles for these three mobs still remain to be fixed.

=== Enderman teleport particles ===
{{more images|section=1}}
[[Endermen]] are programmed to create a trail of particles leading from their old location to their new location when teleporting, but this is not networked correctly. As a result, the particles did not appear in multiplayer and no longer appear at all since 12w18a. Note that due to [[#Instant entity teleportation|teleportation no longer being instant]], some particles may still appear &ndash; these are simply a result of the enderman happening to emit ambient particles mid-interpolation, rather than an effect intentionally programmed into the game. The original teleportation particles have yet to be fixed.

=== Ghast loading animation ===
When [[ghast]]s were first added, they would expand slightly before shooting a fireball, similarly to a creeper about to explode. This created the effect of the ghast "charging" a fireball, rather than just opening its mouth and firing it. However, the effect was not properly networked from the server to the client, causing it to not work in multiplayer. As a result, when singleplayer was changed to use an internal server, the effect broke there too. The expand code was removed entirely in [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]].
<gallery>

=== Minecart physics ===
Prior to the client-server split, minecarts were capable of pushing players, and would react immediately and change direction when pushed. However, minecarts no longer push the player, and turn very sluggishly.<gallery>

Minecart1.3.1.gif|Minecart in 1.3.1 and onwards
</gallery>

=== Instant entity teleportation ===
{{more images|section=1}}
Teleporting entities originally snapped straight from their old position to their new position, with no visible movement between them, as would be expected from a teleport. However, client-side interpolation is not turned off for teleporting entities in multiplayer (and singleplayer after 12w18a), causing them to instead appear to quickly travel in a straight line to the new position. This was reported on the issue tracker and closed as "Works As Intended".<ref>{{bug|MC-303560|resolution=WAI}}</ref>

=== Creative mode default items ===
Prior to 12w18a, creating or loading a singleplayer world in creative mode would automatically fill empty slots in the hotbar with specific blocks corresponding to each slot:
{{Hotbar
|Stone
|Cobblestone
|Bricks
|Dirt
|Oak Planks
|Oak Log
|Oak Leaves
|Torch
|Smooth Stone Slab
}}
These are the same blocks that Creative mode players spawned with from [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-1457|Indev version 20091223-1457]] until the mode's removal [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091231-1856|a few days later]]. When commands were added to singleplayer in [[12w16a]], these blocks would also be given when switching from Survival to Creative mode using the {{cmd|gamemode}} command. In 12w18a onwards, the player no longer receives these blocks.

== Partially fixed features ==
=== Directional damage tilt ===
Originally, taking damage would cause the camera to tilt toward the direction the damage came from. However, the direction value was not properly networked from the server to the client, causing the camera to always tilt left in multiplayer. As a result, when singleplayer was changed to use an internal server, the directional tilt broke there too. The code still existed and was broken until [[Java Edition 23w03a|23w03a]], despite being marked as "Won't Fix" on issue tracker before.
<gallery>
Pre 1.3.1 Screen Tilt.gif|Screen tilt used in versions before 1.3.1
Post 1.3.1 Screen Tilt.gif|Screen tilt used in versions after 1.3.1
</gallery>

It is worth noting that damage without an associated direction is still not fully fixed, as it will "remember" the direction of the previously taken directed damage. Prior to 12w18a, directionless damage would tilt the screen either left or right randomly. Refer to {{bug|MC-259212}} for more information.

=== Dragon egg trails ===
When first implemented, [[dragon egg]]s would leave a trail of particles upon performing a teleportation. This trail of particles would lead from their initial position directly to the position they teleported to. Like several other particle effects, these stopped appearing in 12w18a.

In [[Java Edition 1.4.3|1.4.3]],<ref>{{bug|MC-160}}</ref> the particles were restored, but they are broken &ndash; they are created by the client independently of the egg's actual teleport destination, and thus rarely point to the correct location. This has yet to be fixed.

</gallery>

=== Map behavior ===
[[Map]]s originally had the ability to draw in new terrain very quickly, and the marker indicating the player's location would update in real-time as the player moved and turned. Additionally, opening an existing map after a world reload would have its contents be visible immediately. Since 12w18a, terrain on maps (both new and existing) is now very slowly drawn in column-by-column, and the the position marker appears noticeably more choppy, only updating around three to four times per second.

[[14w28a]] greatly improved the speed at which terrain appears on maps to be near-instant, but the position marker remains unfixed.

=== Progress bars ===
When generating or loading a world or entering a given dimension, a green progress bar would appear on screen under relevant text. As of 1.3.1, this progress bar would no longer appear. For world generation and loading, a chunk graph was added in [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]] and a progress bar was re-added in [[Java Edition 1.21.9|1.21.9]]. However, dimension loading screens still show nothing.
<gallery>

== Fixed features ==
=== Darker thunderstorms ===
Prior to 12w18a, thunderstorms would darken the sky, clouds, and world lighting further than rain did. However, clients were not notified if the world was thundering so the sky appears to be like regular rain instead. This was fixed in [[Java Edition 13w39a|13w39a]], where thunderstorms now darken the sky again.

=== Health bar showing lost hearts ===
Originally when taking damage, the health bar would flash the hearts that had just been lost with a pale red color. This effect did not work in multiplayer, and thus broke when singleplayer was changed to an internal server. The animation was restored in [[14w32a]], and further enhanced so it now stacks lost hearts if damage is taken repeatedly in a short period of time.<ref>https://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/497362125476478976</ref>

=== Portal travel sound ===
Travelling to another dimension via the use of a [[nether portal]] or [[end portal]] would result in a dedicated sound being played on the dimension loading screen. However, this sound did not play in multiplayer, and the player would instead be teleported silently. Therefore, when singleplayer was changed to use a multiplayer server in 12w18a, the sound stopped playing in singleplayer too. In [[Java Edition 16w02a|16w02a]], this sound would now play again, but after transport to the dimension rather than on the loading screen.<ref>{{bug|MC-212651}}</ref>

=== Most server-side particles ===
Certain particles were created dependent on the server, and never showed up on clients connected to said servers. As a result, several particles simply stopped appearing in 12w18a and beyond. The majority of these were eventually fixed in [[Java Edition 19w14a|19w14a]].

The following particles stopped appearing in 12w18a:

* Particles from [[redstone torch]]es burning out
* Bursts of particles from successful [[breeding]]
** Active particles from animals in love mode stopped appearing in 1.9, for a likely similar server-related reason.<ref>{{bug|MC-93826}}</ref>
* Particles from mobs created by [[monster spawner]]s
* Particles from contact between [[water]] and [[lava]]
* Particles from placing an [[eye of ender]] in an [[end portal frame]]

=== Saving Level text ===
{{verify|Was this caused by the internal server? The text still displays in multiplayer in 1.2.5.}}

In the pause menu, the bottom left would display "Saving level.." for a few seconds as it saved the level. As of [[Java Edition 21w42a|21w42a]], the text "Saving world" shows in the bottom right whenever the game autosaves, regardless of if the player is in the pause menu. This can be toggled in the video settings.

=== Nether portal exit animation ===
Exiting a nether portal originally showed a [[screen effect]] combination, in which the nausea effect would ramp down and stop and the overlay would disappear. It occurred since 12w18a until it was fixed in [[Java Edition 1.20 Pre-release 1|1.20 Pre-release 1]].

As of 12w34a, the nether portal screen effects<ref>{{bug|MC-180}}</ref> and trigger sound<ref>{{bug|MC-193749}}</ref> will play even if the player arrives on the other side of a portal, making the brokenness of this exit animation hard to spot. It is still noticeable given that this wrong animation starts weak and gets more intense as if this were a newly entered portal, rather than beginning at full intensity.

<gallery>

The table below demonstrates the historical visual behavior of entering a nether portal, with time passing going to the right. Blank spaces show where the effect does not play, an animated nether portal texture shows when the effect is at full intensity, and a static nether portal texture shows where the portal animation is either accelerating or decelerating. The behavior types shown in the table are used within the following version ranges:

* Type 1: Alpha v1.2.0 &ndash; 12w17a (this behavior is the desirable one)
* Type 2: 12w18a &ndash; 12w32a
* Type 3: 12w34a &ndash; 23w18a

=== Ambient darkness effects ===
At night time, entity shadows would be hidden, the water overlay would be darker and the vignette would show up. In multiplayer however, the variable determining the strength of these effects was not updated even though it is a client-side feature. This was fixed in [[Java Edition 24w40a|24w40a]] where the effects were restored.

=== Sky instantly reflecting desired time after time change ===
{{In development|je||26.1|section=1|}}
Before 12w18a, the sky would instantly change its appearance after the sleeping animation, or after changing time with commands. As of 12w18a there is a noticeable delay before the sky's appearance actually changes as a result of the server only periodically sending time of day updates to clients. Fixed in [[Java Edition 24w44a|24w44a]] for the {{cmd|time}} command and in [[26.1 Snapshot 3]] for beds.
