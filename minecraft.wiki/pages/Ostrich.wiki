The '''ostrich''' was a proposed mob that was featured in the Biome Chooser at [[MINECON Earth 2018]], alongside the [[termite]], [[meerkat]] and [[fox]]. It was a large bird mob that would spawn in [[Savanna|savannas]] with termites. It could also dig its head into the [[Sand|ground]], referencing a common misconception about ostriches.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.clevelandzoosociety.org/z/2020/03/11/truth-or-tail-do-ostriches-really-bury-their-head-in-the-sand-when-scared-or-frightened|title=Truth or Tail: Do ostriches really bury their head in the sand when scared or frightened?|website=Cleveland Zoological Society|date=March 11, 2020}}</ref>

It, along with the rest of the biome, made it to the second round with 27.6%, but lost with 34.7%.
