* Equipped via the [[helmet]] armor slot.

** Unlike the pumpkin overlay, this cannot be turned off by pressing F1.
* Activates a [[shader]] when equipped.
* [[Sign]]s display the text "OBEY" while glasses are equipped, a reference to the science fiction movie [[wikipedia:They Live|''They Live'']].

'''[[File:Ankle_Monitor_(item).png|32px]] [[Ankle Monitor]]'''
* Equipped via the [[boots]] armor slot.
* When equipped in [[Survival]] mode, they can't be taken off.
** Can be taken off in [[Creative]] mode.
* Gives the wearer Slowness I and prints messages in chat if the wearer is far away from spawn at night, or in another dimension.
** The Slowness effect will expire and the printed messages will cease if the wearer returns to spawn, even at night.
* Stackable up to 64.

'''[[File:Smarter_Watch_(item).png|32px]] [[Smarter Watch]]'''
* Equipped on the off-hand slot.
* Shows the time above the [[hotbar]] where item tooltips are shown in [[wikipedia:Human-readable medium|human readable format]] (18:00, and 22:00 for example).
* Push notifications in the [[chat]] whenever a statistic reaches a significant milestone.
** Other messages are shown when the player takes [[damage]] and sometimes even shows [[item]] specific information in chat when items are crafted.
* Stackable up to 64.

== Changes ==
'''[[Mobs]]'''
* [[Zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s now have a chance of being equipped with any of the 3 equipment items added.
** When they wear the reality vision, they do not attack the [[player]], even if the player attacks them, nor do they retaliate against wolves, snow golems and iron golems. They also don't burn in sunlight.
*** Zombies with reality vision still attack [[villager]]s.
*** Zombies with reality vision can be "called" by zombies without reality vision to attack the player, tamed wolves, snow golems and iron golems.
*** Skeletons do not run away from wolves when wearing reality vision.
*[[Enderman|Endermen]] and [[Creeper|Creepers]] now have a chance of being equipped with reality vision
**Endermen do not react to being attacked by the player{{Needs testing|testing results are inconsistent, sometimes they attack the player, sometimes they just teleport a lot}}, but are still aggravated by looking at them without wearing a pumpkin.
***They will still attempt to teleport away from environmental damage, like lava (to varying success).
**Creepers are passive, do not retaliate and aren't scared away by ocelots, 
***They can still be ignited by [[Flint and Steel|flint and steel]].

'''[[Sign|Signs]]'''
{{None|The movie "They Live" is meant to be pronounced "/ðeɪ lɪv/", '''not''' "/ðeɪ laɪv/". Darn you, AntVenom.}}
* Signs have a different unique texture.
* Sign text is now green.
* Signs read "OBEY" while reality vision is equipped. This is a reference to science fiction movie [[Wikipedia:They Live|''They Live'']].

== Issues ==
1.RV-Pre1 is not supported due to being an [[Wikipedia:April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke, and therefore issues affecting it will be closed as "Invalid" in the issue tracker.<ref>{{bug|MC-100379|||Invalid}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* [[Sound]]s are saved in <code>minecraft/sounds/buzzwords/''sound_name''.ogg</code> where <code>''sound_name''</code> is replaced with the actual name of the sound, for example <code>equipvr.ogg</code>.
* The update was released before April 1st by the developers.
* The overlay for the reality vision in the assets folder, <code>cantseeshitcaptain.png</code>, is a reference to a popular meme from the TV show [[Wikipedia:Star Trek|''Star Trek'']].
** This is a rare occurrence of official swearing in Minecraft.
* The [[shader]] for the reality vision can be disabled by using [[F4]].
** However, when the [[player]] goes into [[third person view]], the shader is activated again.
* This version was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* Curiously, this pre-release uses a #.[letters]-Pre# format instead of a #.##-pre#
* This version features in the lowest number of additions and changes among all April Fool's Day joke versions.
