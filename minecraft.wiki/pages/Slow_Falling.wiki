'''Slow Falling''' is a [[status effect]] that causes midair [[entities]] to more gradually descend downward and avoid [[fall damage]], but prevents [[critical hit]]s and [[smash attack]]s.

== Mechanics ==
The affected entity falls at a much slower rate than normal, with a [[Gravity|terminal velocity]] of 9.8 m/s, and is unable to take fall damage when falling. However, the entity still takes damage from using an ender pearl. In addition, the entity cannot turn farmland into dirt by jumping on it.

Higher levels do not decrease fall speed further.

Effects on certain activities:
* Sprinting with the Slow Falling effect allows the [[player]] to jump across a gap of 5 blocks (6 blocks with enough momentum), compared to 4 (5 blocks with enough momentum) blocks normally.
* Unboosted elytra flight is twice as efficient, but four times slower. Boosts work at normal speed, but the momentum gained doesn't last as long.
* The player cannot land a critical hit while having this effect.<ref>{{bug|MC-190451|||WAI}}</ref>
* The player cannot perform a smash attack with the [[mace]] while having this effect.
