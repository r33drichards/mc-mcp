'''Capes''' are special commemorative items that are shown on the back of the player's [[skin]]. They are purely cosmetic and they do not alter any gameplay. Wearing a cape changes the appearance of the [[elytra]], fitting the look of the respective cape. Unlike skins, capes cannot be custom-made and have to be earned. In addition, they cannot be transferred between accounts. Some capes can be earned through various promotions, while other capes are not available to the general public.

Various [[mod]]s offer unofficial capes for players to use. These capes, however, are only visible to other users of those mods. Only capes added by [[Mojang Studios]] are featured below.

== Obtaining ==
With the exception of the [[Pan Cape]], capes that are available to the general public can only be obtained through limited-time promotions. They cannot be obtained after their respective promotions have ended. Some types of promotions that distribute capes are social media campaigns and [[event servers]]. In-person events, although rare, may also grant capes.

Modern capes are often distributed to both editions of the game at the same time, although logging into {{BE}} is sometimes required to activate such capes in {{JE}}.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/31550001045773-Get-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Capes-before-Promotion-End-Dates|website=Minecraft.net|title=Get Minecraft: Java Edition Capes Before Promotion End Dates|author=}}</ref>

== Overview ==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
[[File:MinecraftCapesSelection.png|thumb|479x479px|The Minecraft.net cape selection menu, as it would be viewed with a hypothetical account with all of the capes.]]

In {{JE}}, capes can either be equipped on the skin creation menu in the [[Minecraft Launcher]], or in the profile page on the [[Minecraft.net|Minecraft website]]. 

For about a decade after the introduction of capes in 2010, Java Edition capes could be split into five groups:
* Mojang capes, given only to Mojang employees.
* [[MINECON]] capes, distributed to attendees of the convention. Around 27,000 of these capes exist.<ref>https://namemc.com/capes shows a rough estimate of how many capes of each type have ever been equipped on Java Edition. Note that it is possible to hide previously equipped capes or to simply not equip an owned cape, both of which will cause a cape to not count towards these totals. This also does not include Bedrock Edition players, who may later add to the Java Edition counters of cross-platform capes if they equip a cross-platform cape there. Finally, as there is no way to detect capes that are removed from accounts by staff members, the totals will continue to count such capes. This does not happen under normal circumstances, but it has happened for personal capes that were given out by accident.</ref>
* Personal capes, which were given to single individuals as appreciation for something they did.
* Volunteer capes, given to contributors in various programs, such as [[Crowdin]], [[Mojira]], and the [[Realms]] map making program.
* Competition capes, given to those who had won competitions in Mojang's other games, ''[[Scrolls]]'' and ''[[Cobalt (game)|Cobalt]]''. These competitions were short-lived, with only the top players winning these capes, so only around 30 of these capes exist.

Of these, only MINECON capes were available to the public in significant numbers. Therefore, at the time, capes were far more exclusive items than they are today.

As ''Minecraft'' became more popular, however, this exclusivity caused capes, and accounts that had them, to become premier items on black markets.<ref>https://x.com/Marc_IRL/status/1319158179591344128</ref> Partly due to this, accounts with rare capes have been known to be common targets of hacking attempts<ref>https://x.com/cheapshot/status/1240855558619463680</ref><ref>https://x.com/billyK___/status/1666259127692083202</ref> and unwanted solicitation. This exclusivity grew in 2017 when MINECON events became livestreams and stopped distributing capes, leading to a period of almost five years between [[MINECON 2016]] and the account migration in 2021 where no new Java Edition capes could be obtained by the public.

Since the [[Java account migration|account migration]], which granted the [[Migrator Cape]] to all Java Edition players who migrated, various capes have been available to the general public without being tied to in-person events. This is likely in order to avoid the problems associated with the aforementioned exclusivity.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
[[File:MinecraftCapesSelectionBedrock.png|thumb|width=200x200|The Bedrock Edition cape selection menu, as it would be viewed with a hypothetical account with all of the capes.]]
In {{BE}}, capes can be equipped in the Capes section on the [[Character Creator]]. As Character Creator items, they are assigned a rarity, usually Legendary.

Capes are also available as part of some skins included in certain [[skin pack]]s, but they can only be equipped with their corresponding skin. Most notably, the [[MINECON 2016 Skin Pack]] included Steve and Alex skins wearing all [[MINECON]] capes from 2011 to 2016. However, these capes were locked to the skin pack, so they cannot be used with custom skins. For documentation purposes, capes from skin packs are considered to be separate from standard capes, which can be freely equipped with any skin. Statements about capes on this wiki will exclude these by default.

There were a few exclusive capes on Bedrock. Although cape support on Bedrock Edition was added on 2016, it was used exclusively for skin packs until 2019, when the [[Founder's Cape]] was released. A second cape, called the [[Pan Cape]], was given to all Bedrock Edition players for free starting in 2020 and is still given out to this day. Thus far, it is the only cape on either edition to automatically be given out to all players without any known time limit. 

Not long after this, however, the Java Edition account migration occurred, which ultimately led to the introduction of cross-platform capes.

On May 8, 2025, the Founder's Cape and Pan Cape were distributed to Java Edition players as well. The [[Progress Pride Cape]] is currently the only cape exclusive to Bedrock Edition.

=== Cross-platform capes ===
After the migration from Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts in 2021, ownership of both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition was tied to a single account. In 2022, both editions were merged into one bundle, ensuring that all players would always have access to both. These changes allowed capes to be obtained in both editions at the same time after fulfilling the requirements, which became the standard. All capes released to the public after the merger were released for both editions, with the sole exception of the aforementioned [[Progress Pride Cape]].

There may have been some hesitancy on Mojang's part to grant capes distributed through Bedrock Edition event servers to Java Edition accounts. This is supported by the fact that the [[Cherry Blossom Cape]] and the [[MCC 15th Year Cape]], the first two capes tied to event servers, were not originally announced for Java. Ultimately, both of these capes were added to Java Edition after the conclusion of their respective events. Since then, capes added by live events have been announced for and immediately granted to both editions upon completion of the requirements.

=== Legacy Console Edition ===
Two exclusive ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'' capes were known to exist, neither of which were permanently made available to the general public. The [[Microsoft Xbox Cape]] was available only for Microsoft employees, and the [[Xbox 1st Birthday Cape]] was temporarily shown on all players during the Xbox edition's first anniversary. There was apparently also a cape for Mojang employees, but its design is not known.<ref>{{tweet|PopsRamjet|1128979747382452224|archiveid=20220326205242|#minecraftmemories Time to pull another photo of out the archives :) Once upon a time we used to have the ability to turn capes on & off on in #MinecraftXBLA #MinecraftX360 This is the cape that Microsoft folks had when they played online! @mojang had one too & our 1st birthday!|May 16, 2019}}</ref>

Like Bedrock Edition, most of the [[Legacy Console Edition]]s also featured skin packs, some of which came with capes.

The now-defunct Xbox 360 marketplace had some cosmetic Xbox avatar items based off of capes available for purchase. These include avatar versions of the Xbox 1st Birthday Cape and all of the MINECON capes released before 2016. These can be viewed on the [[Xbox 360 avatar items]] page.

=== Customer support tool capes ===
Mojang has confirmed that a number of unused ''[[Java Edition]]'' capes have existed in the Customer Support tool, which have never been shown to the public. Some of them, such as the [[Birthday Cape]], were first given an owner a long time after they had been made.<ref>{{tweet|Marc_IRL|1482004621384204290|Just found this linked from the wiki 😜 I think this is one of the capes available in the CS tool forever ago, and I wanted to note the restraint it took to not add it to my account, because as soon as I did the world would know.
