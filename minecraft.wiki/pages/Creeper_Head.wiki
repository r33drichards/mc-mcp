A '''creeper head''' is the [[head]] of a [[creeper]] in the form of a [[block]]. It can only be obtained by killing a creeper using a different [[charged creeper]]'s [[explosion]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of creeper head.<ref>{{bug|MC-192905||Heads & Skulls have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Creeper Head}}
Creeper head drops itself when it's destroyed.
When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the creeper head always drops as an item.

=== Mob loot ===
Creeper heads are always dropped by a [[creeper]] if it dies due to a [[charged creeper]]'s explosion. {{IN|bedrock}}, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however {{in|java}} only one mob selected at random drops its head.<ref>{{bug|MC-63534|||WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
Creeper heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to [[sign]]s. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

=== Wearing ===
{{See also|#Renders}}

The player can wear creeper heads, similarly to [[pumpkin]]s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

==== Disguise ====
Wearing a creeper head reduces the detection range for [[creeper]]s to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from [[sneaking]] and from the [[Invisibility]] status effect.

{{IN|bedrock}}, wearing a creeper head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]].

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a creeper head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Creeper head is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].

=== Note blocks ===
Placing a creeper head above a [[note block]] causes the note block to play the [[creeper]]'s {{cd|primed}} (hissing) sound when activated. This is unlike other mob heads, as creepers don't make {{cd|ambient}} sounds.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.
