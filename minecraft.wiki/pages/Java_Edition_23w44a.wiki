'''23w44a''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.3]], released on November 1, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w44a|November 1, 2023}}</ref> which makes tweaks to commands, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Decorated pot]]s'''
* Now can utilize loot tables and read from the <code>LootTable</code> tag key.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bat]]s'''
* The model of the bat has been changed to match {{BE}}.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* {{cmd|link=none|execute (if{{!}}unless) function}} will no longer always fail if all functions had no return.
** If there were no {{cmd|link=none|return}}s in called functions, <code>if</code> will fail and <code>unless</code> will pass.
** First {{cmd|link=none|return}} in any of called functions will return (for a single context).

'''{{cmd|function}}'''
* If {{cmd|link=none|function ''<function tag>''}} runs multiple functions in combination with {{cmd|link=none|return run}}, execution will stop after first {{cmd|link=none|return}} in any of the functions.
* A single call to the {{cmd|link=none|function}} command will always have return when run with {{cmd|link=none|return run}}.
** For example, {{cmd|link=none|return run execute ''[split context]'' run function ''<some function with conditional return>''}} will always return after processing the first context.

'''{{cmd|return}}'''
* {{cmd|link=none|return run}} now always return.
** If there are no valid results from returned command, function containing {{cmd|link=none|return run}} fails (i.e. <code>success=0</code> and <code>result=0</code>).
* {{cmd|link=none|return run}} now propagates success value together with results value (previously it always set success to <code>1</code>).
* {{cmd|link=none|return run}} now also allows storing values, which means {{cmd|link=none|execute store ... run return run ''some_command''}} both stores value and returns it outside function.
* Added new subcommand {{cmd|link=none|return fail}}, to make whole function fail (i.e. return <code>success=0</code> and <code>result=0</code>).

'''{{cmd|tick}}'''
* The <code><nowiki><time></nowiki></code> parameter in the {{cmd|link=none|tick step}} command is now optional. The default value is <code>1</code>.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>23</code>.

== Experimental ==
These changes only take effect when the [[Update 1.21]] experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Chiseled copper]]'''
* Now can be crafted from a [[cut copper]] by stonecutting, resulting in a chiseled copper with the matching variant.

'''[[Copper door]] and [[copper trapdoor]]'''
* Updated block and item textures for all variants.

'''[[Tuff bricks]], [[tuff brick slab]], [[tuff brick stairs]], and [[tuff brick wall]]'''
* Updated block and item textures.

== Fixes ==
