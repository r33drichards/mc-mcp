A '''bee''' is a flying [[arthropod]]an [[neutral mob]] that lives in a [[bee nest]] or [[beehive]], and fills it with harvestable [[honey]] using nectar it gathers from [[flower]]s. Attacking a bee, or interfering with its home without proper precautions, causes it and all nearby bees to attack using their stingers. If a bee attacks something, it will lose its stinger and eventually die.

== Spawning ==
Bees are the only [[arthropod]] mob that can spawn in any [[difficulty]] including Peaceful.

=== Natural generation ===
Naturally generated [[bee nest]]s generate with 3 bees in them.

Naturally-generated birch or oak trees have equal chances to generate with a [[bee nest]], depending on the biome:

=== Saplings ===
[[Birch]], [[cherry]], and [[oak]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of any 1- or 2-block tall [[flower]]s, [[flowering azalea]], [[cherry leaves]], [[flowering azalea leaves]], [[mangrove propagule]], [[spore blossom]], [[pink petals]], or [[chorus flower]] have a 5% chance of having a [[bee nest]] containing 2–3 bees.

[[Mangrove]]s grown from [[mangrove propagule]]s have a 1% chance of having a bee nest containing 2-3 bees. Unlike birch, cherry and oak trees, no flowers are required for a bee nest to generate.<ref>{{bug|MC-249937||Propagules grown without a flower nearby can generate bee nests in the mangrove tree|WAI}}</ref>

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Upon death, adult bees drop {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]]. Like other baby animals, killing a baby bee yields no experience.

=== Breeding ===
Upon [[breeding]] with any flower successfully, {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.

== Behavior ==
Bees do not fly (like [[ghast]]s or the [[ender dragon]]), but instead hover a few [[block]]s above the ground similar to [[bat]]s and [[parrot]]s.

Bees are considered [[arthropod]]s and take increased [[damage]] from the [[Bane of Arthropods]] enchantment.<ref name="pre">{{Mcnet|minecraft-snapshot-19w36a|Minecraft Snapshot 19w36a|July 3, 2019}}</ref> They also take damage when touching [[water]].<ref>{{bug|MC-167148||Bees take damage upon contact with water|WAI}}</ref>

Bees can be attached to a [[lead]], even when angered. They can still attack while attached.

Bees usually venture up to 22 [[block]]s from their beehive to collect nectar from a viable plant or to attack someone. Bees can venture farther away if necessary.

Bees do not take damage from [[sweet berry bush]]es.

A bee can fly horizontally and vertically upward through scaffolding but does not fly downward. A bee does not fly through an open trapdoor or regular door on its own (a bee can be led through a [[door]] with a flower) but babies can fly through the gap above a fence gate in a 1×2 doorway. {{IN|je}}, Bees also spin on scaffolding if they are on top of it and cannot go anywhere.<ref>{{bug|MC-271388||Bees spin on scaffolding}}</ref>

Despite being flying mobs, bees can destroy [[turtle egg]]s when on top of them.<ref>{{bug|MC-248332}}</ref>

=== Pollinating ===
Bees leave their nest during the day. They fly around [[Bee Nest|their nests]] and are attracted to [[flower]]s (except [[closed eyeblossom]]s), [[flowering azalea]]s, [[flowering azalea leaves]], [[mangrove propagule]]s, [[pink petals]], [[cherry leaves]], [[spore blossom]]s, [[chorus flower]]s, [[cactus flower]]s, and [[wildflowers]], which are the valid plants for the bee to gather nectar from. Bees can gather nectar from [[wither rose]]s but receive the [[Wither (effect)|wither effect]]. As a result, bees can die.<ref>{{bug|MC-159396||Bees target wither roses and die|WAI}}</ref>
Bees can also gather nectar from [[open eyeblossom]]s, but get poisoned as result; they completely ignore [[closed eyeblossom]]s and are unable to gather nectar from them. 
Bees also completely ignore flowers in [[flower pot]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-168267}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-109956}}</ref>

After circling a flower for more than 400 ticks, a bee collects nectar. However, if the bee gets damaged, it ceases its efforts to collect nectar. A bee carrying nectar has nectar spots on its abdomen and drops nectar [[particle]]s to fertilize plants below the bee. 

Bees that have nectar may pollinate [[wheat crop]]s, [[potato crop]]s, [[carrot crop]]s, [[beetroot crop]]s, [[melon stem]]s, [[sweet berry bush]]es, [[pumpkin stem]]s, [[cave vines]], [[torchflower crop]]s, and [[pitcher crop]]s{{only|bedrock}} that they fly over. When one of these plants gets pollinated, it advances to another growth stage, similar to using [[bone meal]]. To pollinate a plant, a bee must be 1 to 2 blocks directly above the plant and must have a valid home hive. A bee can fertilize plants 10 times each time they have nectar. There is an approximately 5% chance each tick to attempt fertilization.

Afterward, the bee flies back into its hive/nest to make honey. It takes about 2 minutes for the bee to do this.

=== Housing ===
[[File:Bee and bee nest.png|thumb|A bee going into a [[bee nest]].]]
{{See also|Tutorial:Honey farming}}
Bees live together in colonies and take any [[bee nest]] or [[beehive]] that has enough space as its home. One bee nest/beehive can house up to 3 bees. Homeless bees search for empty beehives by wandering around generally in a northwest direction. Bees can enter a beehive from any side, but exit only from the front. One-way bee-gates can be made by using this mechanic.

Bees return to their nest when it [[rain]]s and during the [[night]]. This behavior extends to biomes that don't rain, such as the [[desert]]. They stay in their nest or hive for at least {{convert|2400|game tick|minute}} before coming back out. Bees in a nest/hive retain their data ([[health]], name, etc.). 

Breaking a nest or hive without [[Silk Touch]] releases all bees contained inside. If the nest or hive is harvested using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the bees are contained in the dropped item and can exit the nest/hive when it is placed again.

When a bee that has nectar enters and then leaves its nest or hive, the honey level of the nest/hive is increased by one; there is a 1% chance it is increased by two. When the honey level of that hive reaches 5, the [[player]] can harvest [[honeycomb]]s or [[honey bottle]]s. The honey level resets back to 0 when a honeycomb or honey bottle is harvested.

Because there is neither [[daylight cycle]] nor [[weather]] in [[the Nether]] and [[the End]], bees work without resting in these dimensions. This behavior is distinct from that of the [[villager]]s, which follow their daily routine according to the time in the [[Overworld]], regardless of which dimension they are in.

=== Attacking ===
{{main|Damage}}
All bees nearby are angered when an individual bee is attacked (unless the bee attacked is killed in one hit), honey or honeycombs are collected (unless a campfire is placed under the nest), or a bee nest/beehive is destroyed. Even destroying newly-placed uninhabited beehives anger nearby bees. Hitting or walking on a beehive does not anger bees; only destroying it angers them. When destroyed, a beehive releases any bees that it contained. If the beehive is destroyed with a [[Silk Touch]] tool, bees kept within the hive remain neutral, while those outside the hive also remain neutral.

[[File:Invisible stingers.png|thumb|The [[Invisibility]] effect does not cause stingers in stung players to disappear.]]
Bees attack and swarm the [[player]] as a group when angered, and the eyes of angered bees turn red. Collecting a [[honeycomb]] or a [[honey bottle]] from a nest or hive causes the bees that are currently in that nest or hive to leave and swarm the player unless a [[campfire]] is placed below the hive. Bees attack only once, similar to [[llama]]s, and non-aggressive [[panda]]s.

Bees do not deal any damage in [[Peaceful]] difficulty and are completely passive. They fly outside the beehive and search for flowers as usual.

If the player deflects a bee's attack with a [[shield]], the bee continues attacking until it succeeds in hitting the player.

When a bee's attack on a player succeeds, the player is [[poison]]ed. A bee loses its stinger after a successful attack, cannot attack further and does not retreat to its nest (even at night), and dies approximately one minute later. This can be delayed with potion [[effect]]s ([[Regeneration]]/[[Resistance]]/[[Absorption]]) that have a 255 potency.

It is possible to (quickly) breed at least one angered bee with another, even if it or they had stung and lost the stinger. However, they remain angered and still die later due to being stingerless.

Bees also swarm and attack other [[mob]]s when [[damage]]d, for example, if a [[skeleton]] accidentally shoots a bee.

Bees become neutral if they fail to land a hit on their target within 25 seconds. However, {{inUpcoming|java 26.1}}, bees never become neutral after being attacked.<ref>{{bug|MC-305388|resolution=WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|java}}, a bee's stinger is visible on the player as a small black dot after the bee successfully attacked.

=== Breeding ===
{{Main|Breeding}}

Bees follow [[player]]s holding any 1- or 2-block tall [[flower]]s (except [[closed eyeblossom]]), [[mangrove propagule]]s, [[flowering azalea]]s, [[flowering azalea leaves]], [[cherry leaves]], [[pink petals]], [[wildflowers]], [[spore blossom]]s, [[cactus flower]]s or [[chorus flower]]s. If the player is standing still and being followed by bees, the bees go toward the player, face the player, and rest on the ground. They do this until the player moves.

If bees are given any of the blocks listed above (except [[open eyeblossom]] and [[wither rose]]), they enter love mode and pair up to create baby bees, granting the [[player]] 1-7 [[experience]]. The parent bees have a cooldown of 5 minutes (6000 ticks) before they can be [[Breeding|bred]] again. Babies take {{convert|20|minute|in-game day}} to grow up. The growth of baby bees can be accelerated using flowers; each use reduces the remaining time by 10%. However, bees' growth timer and breeding cooldowns are frozen while working in a hive; thus, when rapidly growing a population, it may be desirable to temporarily remove the hives.

[[Wither rose]]s and [[open eyeblossom]]s cannot be used for breeding bees or growing baby bees. Feeding a bee a wither rose inflicts it with the [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect for {{convert|2|second|game tick}}, while feeding a bee an open eyeblossom inflicts it with [[Poison]] for {{convert|1.25|second|game tick}}. [[Closed eyeblossom]]s cannot be used to lead, breed or grow bees.

* Bees were made to be half a [[block]] in size because [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] considered this size to be the cutest.<ref>{{ytl|OZqNaEX8208|t=38m40s|MINECON Live 2019|Minecraft|September 28, 2019}}</ref>
* Bees pollinate the top half of [[sunflower]]s.
* In reality, juvenile bees are helpless, worm-like larvae, not smaller versions of adults.
* Also in reality, bees collect both nectar and pollen by pollinating flowers. The pollen is used as a primary food source by the bee colony, but has little direct importance to the formation of honey, which is made from the nectar and serves as another food source. Also, in real life, bees are scared of smoke and don't exit the nest or hive.
* However, bees losing their stingers and dying after attacking the player is consistent with real bees, as in reality their stingers are barbed and attached to vital organs, so the stinger gets stuck and causes fatal injuries to the bee once it tries to fly away and the stinger detaches.
