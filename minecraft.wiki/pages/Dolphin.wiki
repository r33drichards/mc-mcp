'''Dolphins''' are aquatic [[neutral mob]]s <!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO MAMMALS. MOJANG STUDIOS DOES NOT CONSIDER MOBS AS SUCH. --> that live in non-frozen [[ocean]]s. They grant a speed boost to [[player]]s that [[swim]] near them and follow the player while swimming.

== Spawning ==
Dolphins are found in groups (pods) of 1-2{{Only|je|short=1}} or 3-5{{Only|be|short=1}} in all [[ocean]] biomes, excluding frozen oceans and cold oceans{{Only|je|short=1}}. They spawn exclusively between levels 50 and 64.
Dolphins continuously spawn as long as their spawn requirements are met, and naturally despawn if no players are near by, similar to [[squid]] and [[nautilus]]es. 

{{IN|je}}, dolphins, squids, and nautiluses together make up the water creatures [[mob cap]].

Dolphins have a 10% chance to spawn as a baby.

* {{xp|1|3}}, if kill credit is given to the player.

Killing a baby dolphin yields neither items nor experience.

== Behavior ==
[[File:DolphinJumping.gif|thumb|Dolphins jumping in water.]]
Dolphins normally swim in pods, occasionally leaping out of the [[water]] to get air. They are also able to jump from one body of water to another. Additionally, they chase after [[player]]s in [[boat]]s but don't give the speed boost effect.

Players who [[Swimming#Sprint-swimming|sprint-swim]] within a 9 block spherical radius of a dolphin receive a swimming speed boost for 5 seconds, replenished as long as the player continues to sprint-swim within a 15 block spherical radius of a dolphin. [[Invisibility]] reduces both of these ranges like normal, based on the amount of armor the player is wearing. {{IN|java}}, the speed boost is granted by the [[Dolphin's Grace]] effect, while {{in|bedrock}} the player simply gets the speed boost without a status effect. The dolphin keeps following the player as long as they are sprint-swimming, allowing the player to swim under the speed boost for long distances.

{{IN|java}}, dolphins are lured by [[item (entity)|dropped item]]s that are inside nearby water blocks, knocking them around and chasing them. If the dolphin can not find a path to a dropped item, the dolphin may stay underwater to the point of [[drowning]].<ref>{{bug|MC-221510}}</ref> If the dolphin is in, or on, a [[waterlogged]] bottom [[slab]] or [[chest]] with an [[air]] block above, or a bubble column, the dolphin is prevented from drowning. 

When a player or another mob hits a dolphin (unless the dolphin is killed in one hit {{in|Java}}), the whole pod retaliates, attacking all at once, similar to [[wolves]] and [[zombified piglin]]s. Hostile dolphins remain hostile even if they are fed fish. Hostile dolphins are far more vicious {{in|bedrock}}.

Feeding dolphins [[raw cod]] or [[raw salmon]] improves their "trust" and interactions with the player, depending on the amount of fish fed. 

When dolphins are fed raw cod or raw salmon, they swim to the nearest [[shipwreck]] or [[ocean ruins]]; {{in|java}}, the structures a dolphin can locate are defined in the <code>dolphin_located</code> [[Tag#Structure tags|tag]]. Dolphins also avoid [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s.

Unlike most “animal” mobs, dolphins cannot [[breed]]. Baby dolphins can only be found when they naturally spawn. A baby dolphin eventually turns into an adult after 24000 ticks (20 minutes), and its growth time can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed fish. A baby dolphin fed a fish once per second grows up in approximately 48 seconds using 47 fish.

Dolphins do not deal any damage in [[Peaceful]] difficulty and are completely passive.

Unlike other neutral mobs, dolphins don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

=== Weaknesses ===
If a dolphin leaves the [[water]] in dry weather, it starts taking suffocation damage after two minutes, and eventually dies. It takes no damage out of water during [[rain]]. Regardless of weather, a dolphin on land actively seeks out a body of water, or seeks its target if in a hostile state.

They cannot survive without air, so if they stay submerged for about four minutes, they begin [[drowning]]. The [[water breathing]] effect prevents them from drowning.

Like most other aquatic mobs, dolphins cannot ride [[boat]]s.{{only|bedrock}}

Dolphins can be towed by a [[lead]].

{{IN|JE}}, the dolphin is an aquatic [[mob]], and is affected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment. {{IN|BE}}, it is only affected when in the water, since all mobs are affected by Impaling when in the water (in ''Bedrock Edition'').

=== Breeding ===
Dolphins cannot be bred by the player. Baby dolphins only occur through natural spawning in the wild.

== Trivia ==
*To create the [[sound]]s that the dolphins make in the game, [[Mojang Studios]]' lead sound designer, [[Samuel Åberg]], went to [[wikipedia:Kolmården Wildlife Park|Kolmården Wildlife Park]] to record [[wikipedia:Dolphin|real dolphins]].<ref>{{Mcnet|talking-dolphins|Talking Dolphins|May 19, 2018|Marsh Davies}}</ref>
*Dolphins originally had a separate head and body when shown in a clip at [[MINECON 2017]]. It is also shown in artwork for [[Java Edition 1.13]], the [[Bundles of Bravery - Official Trailer|Bundles of Bravery]] trailer, and a video about AI (AI in general, not [[mob AI]]).<ref>{{YouTube link|cpQVeaqdf9s|AI for Good: Solving Problems with AI|Minecraft|September 3, 2024}}</ref>
*Real-life dolphins don't suffocate outside of water; they breathe air like all mammals, although they can die of dehydration out of water.
*In 2018, a prediction poll was held in which Chinese users could vote on which Chinese animal they expected to see in Minecraft, to promote the release of Minecraft China. One of the options for voting was the possibly extinct baiji dolphin. The [[panda]] won the poll and was announced days later at [[MINECON Earth 2018]].<ref>https://mc.163.com/pe/client/activity/voteforanimalpc/</ref>
*Mojang has considered and rejected the suggestion to allow dolphins to be tamed or ridden.<ref>
