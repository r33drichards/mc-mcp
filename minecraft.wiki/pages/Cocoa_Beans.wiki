'''Cocoa beans''' are [[item]]s obtained from cocoa pods, and are used to plant more of them as well as to craft [[brown dye]] and [[cookie]]s.

'''Cocoa pods''' are [[plant]] blocks that can only be placed on [[jungle log]] sides and grow cocoa beans. They can be found naturally in [[jungle]]s.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|Java}}, cocoa beans are only obtained through the natural generation of cocoa pods, while {{in|Bedrock}}, they can also be found in bonus chests, from [[fishing]] inside the jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes and from [[trading]] with a [[wandering trader]]{{verify|Was it changed to sell brown dye instead to match Java Edition?}}.

The block itself can be obtained by inventory editing or [[add-on]]s {{in|Bedrock}}.

=== Natural generation ===
Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods, which are found on naturally-generated [[Log|jungle logs]] in [[jungle]] and [[sparse jungle]] [[biome]]s. Cocoa pods do not generate on jungle trees grown from [[sapling]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Breaking ===
Cocoa pods can be mined with any item, but [[axe]]s are the quickest. Fully grown cocoa pods drop 3 cocoa beans. Using a tool enchanted with Fortune does not increase the amount of cocoa beans dropped.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Cocoa|Axe|sword=1|link=none}}

=== Generated loot ===
1-2 cocoa beans can be found in 40% of bonus [[chest]]s {{in|Bedrock}}.
{{LootChestItem|cocoa-beans}}

=== Fishing ===
Cocoa beans can be obtained from [[fishing]] in a jungle {{in|Bedrock}}.

== Usage ==
=== Farming ===
[[File:Cocoaplant farm.png|thumb|A somewhat efficient cocoa pod farm, minimizing space and wood use.]]
{{main|Tutorial:Cocoa Bean farming}}
Placing cocoa beans on the side of a jungle [[log]] plants a new cocoa pod. The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on [[Log|jungle logs]], [[Wood|jungle wood]], [[Stripped Log|stripped jungle logs]] and [[Stripped Wood|stripped jungle wood]].

Cocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a [[Tick#Random tick|random tick]], giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. [[Bone meal]] can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their [[log]] or wood are removed by any means.

=== Composting ===
Placing cocoa beans into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{IN|Bedrock}}, cocoa beans are accepted as a direct substitute of brown dye in many recipes.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Cocoa Beans|Cocoa Pod}}

== Trivia ==
* In real life, a {{W|Cocoa bean|cocoa beans|newtab=1}} are the seeds of the {{W|Theobroma cacao|cacao tree|newtab=1}}, which grows pods that contain 20 to 60 beans each.
* Cocoa pods have a different hitbox for each size; however, the top is always 0.25 blocks below the top of the [[log]] it is on.
* If a cocoa pod grows while the player is standing next to it, the player is forced into the appropriate form of [[suffocation prevention]] depending on available space.
* {{IN|Bedrock}}, the pixels on top of the fully grown pod are 8/7 the size of those on the side.<ref>{{bug|MC-109055|||Fixed}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-152862}}</ref>
