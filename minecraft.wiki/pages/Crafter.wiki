A [[crafter]] is a low-capacity storage [[block]] that can use its contents to [[craft]] items when given a [[redstone]] signal, ejecting the results [[Item (entity)|into the world]] or into a container it is facing. Its inventory slots can be individually locked so [[hopper]]s and similar blocks cannot fill them, while not affecting [[crafting recipes]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Crafters can be mined with anything, but [[pickaxe]]s are the quickest.

== Usage ==
{{IN|je}}, crafters cannot be moved by [[piston]]s.

=== Container ===
A crafter has nine slots of inventory space, arranged in a 3-by-3 grid like a [[crafting table]]. Its GUI can be accessed by {{control|using}} it.

A slot can be enabled or disabled, which can be toggled by clicking on it when empty. Disabled slots cannot have items put in them.

[[Hopper]]s, [[dropper]]s and other crafters interact with crafters by inserting items into its inventory. Hoppers can remove ingredients as well. When an item is added:
* The crafter will look for an empty slot to insert that item into. It searches in standard reading order.
* So it searches the slots in this order: top left, top center, top right, middle left, middle center, middle right, bottom left, bottom center, bottom right.
* Only enabled slots are checked.
* If the crafter has all enabled item slots filled, then the item is added to the lowest count item stack of the same type. If there is a tie, it uses the same reading order described before.<ref>{{mcnet|minecraft-snapshot-23w42a|Minecraft Snapshot 23w42a|October 18, 2023}}</ref>

Hoppers and droppers can interact with all sides of the crafter, and added items follow the rules described above.

=== Redstone component ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Crafter}}

When a crafter receives a redstone signal, it waits for {{convert|4|game tick|second}} before ejecting one crafted item using the ingredients from the nine inventory slots. The crafted items are subsequently ejected from the front of the crafter. If the front of a crafter is facing a container (including another crafter), the crafted items are transferred into the container. If the container it is facing is full, or the item cannot be inserted into the container, the crafter ejects the item instead. Crafters interact with containers [[Dropper#Container interactions|similar to droppers]]. If a recipe has byproducts (e.g. empty bottles for honey blocks or empty buckets for cake) those are ejected after the crafted item.

For shaped recipes, the position of the items in the inventory matters. Because disabled slots prevent items from entering the slot, crafters can be used to craft any item in the game automatically without any input from the player, using a series of hoppers and/or droppers and the correct configuration of disabled slots for the recipe.

A hopper placed below a crafter collects the ingredients from the crafting grid, not the resulting item.

{{IN|java}}, unlike [[dispenser]]s and [[dropper]]s, crafters aren't affected by [[quasi-connectivity]].<ref>{{bug|MC-265943||Crafter cannot be powered above through an air block like dispensers/droppers/pistons|WAI}}</ref>

[[Comparator]]s can emit a redstone signal when reading from a crafter. The signal strength is equal to the number of crafting slots that are either disabled or occupied by an item. <ref>{{ytl|8jwAtfyxhlk|Minecraft Live 2023: Discovering the trial chambers! @ 9:31|Minecraft|October 15, 2023|t=571}}</ref> The stack size of the item has no effect on the comparators output signal e.g. having 1 stick in a slot vs having 64 sticks in that same slot both output the same comparator signal. An empty crafter with no disabled slots does not output any signal through a comparator. A crafter with every slot being disabled or containing an item (of any stack size) outputs a signal strength of nine through a comparator.
