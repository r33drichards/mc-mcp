A '''brown mushroom''' is a variety of fungus that grows and spreads in dark areas. Brown mushrooms can generate small or [[Huge Mushroom|huge]] in size.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Brown mushrooms can be [[instant mining|instantly mined]] with any tool, including by hand. Mining a brown huge [[mushroom block]] drops up to 2 brown mushrooms. [[Fortune]] does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.<ref>{{bug|MC-156657||Fortune doesn't work on mushroom blocks|Invalid}}</ref>

A brown mushroom also breaks instantly and drops as an item if:
* the block below it is moved or destroyed
* a [[fluid]] flows over it
* a block next to it changes state, but only when it is ''not'' on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], or [[nylium]] and light level is 13 or higher
{{breaking row|Brown Mushroom|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Brown mushrooms naturally generate in poorly lit areas ([[light level]] of 12 or less). If this condition is met, each [[chunk]] has a {{frac|1|4}} (25.0%) chance to generate brown mushrooms in the form of [[random patch]]es.<ref>{{IN|java}}, they rarely generate because they cannot generate underground due to {{bug|MC-244162}}.</ref>

Brown mushrooms also generate on the surface of a [[swamp]], [[old growth spruce taiga]], [[old growth pine taiga]], or [[mushroom fields]] biome, along with anywhere in [[the Nether]]. Unlike plants, they are able to generate on top of nearly any block type.

{{IN|java}}, brown mushrooms are commonly found in patches on the [[Nether roof]], and alongside red mushrooms are the only blocks that can generate there. 

Brown mushrooms also generate inside "mushroom farm" rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s.

==== Fallen trees ====
[[Fallen tree]]s can have up to 2 mushrooms generated on them.

{{block distribution|Brown Mushroom}}

=== Huge mushrooms ===
Mining a brown [[huge mushroom]] has a chance of dropping brown mushrooms for each block mined.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Shear]]ing a brown [[mooshroom]] drops 5 brown mushrooms and permanently turns it into a normal [[cow]].

Shearing a [[bogged]] drops 2 mushrooms, both of which can be brown.

An [[enderman]] holding a brown mushroom drops it upon death.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|brown-mushroom}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 3 brown mushrooms for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
=== Planting ===
{{main|Mushroom#Planting}}
Brown mushrooms can be planted and grown on blocks that have a full top surface in [[light]] levels below 13 and not directly underneath the sky, unless on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], or [[nylium]].

=== Huge mushrooms ===
{{main|Huge Mushroom#Growth}}
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a brown mushroom, the mushroom has a chance to grow into a brown [[huge mushroom]], provided that it is on a proper block ([[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]], or [[pale moss block]] at a light level of 12 or below; on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]] or [[nylium]] at any light level) and is free of [[solid block]]s within 5 blocks ''directly'' above the mushroom.

=== Spread ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Mushroom farming}}

When receiving a [[random tick]], a brown mushroom has a 4% chance of spreading to a nearby block (including even above and below diagonally) if there are fewer than five brown mushrooms in a 9×9×3 volume around the original brown mushroom.

=== Light source ===
Brown mushrooms emit a barely visible [[light level]] of 1.<ref>{{bug|MC-832|||WAI}}</ref> However, they do not emit light in flower pots.<ref>{{bug|MC-200055}}</ref>

=== Decoration ===
Brown mushrooms can be planted in a [[flower pot]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Brown Mushroom}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a brown mushroom into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

* The brown mushroom is based on the edible ''[[wikipedia:Boletus_edulis|Boletus edulis]]'' (penny bun).<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|1563155397115985920|I agree about the fly mushroom. I think Notch added it because it looks cool. The brown mushroom is a penny bun and is definitely edible. We currently aren't planning to change them, but we'll see in the future.}}</ref>
