A '''diamond''' is a mineral that can be obtained from [[diamond ore]] along with [[loot chest]]s, [[vault]]s, [[Ominous Vault|ominous vault]]s, and [[suspicious sand]]. It is required to craft diamond [[tool]]s, [[armor]], and [[enchanting table]]s and is also used to duplicate [[smithing template]]s.

== Obtaining ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Diamonds}}

=== Mining ===
{{see also|Diamond Ore#Natural generation}}
[[Diamond ore]] can be mined using an [[iron pickaxe]] or better. An ore drops a single diamond. If mined by any other tool, it drops nothing. If the pickaxe is enchanted with [[Fortune]], it has a chance of dropping an extra diamond per level of Fortune, allowing for a maximum of 4 diamonds with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], it drops an ore block rather than a diamond.

The ore is found at level 15 or lower, most commonly between -50 and -64; levels -58 and -59 are the preferred levels to mine at since they don't contain [[bedrock]], which starts spawning at -60.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|diamond}}

A [[vault]] may eject a diamond when activated by a player, giving diamonds limited renewability if multiple players activate the vault.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|Block of Diamond
|Output= Diamond,9
|type= Material
}}

=== Smelting ===

}}

== Usage ==
Diamonds are mainly used to craft high-tier armor and equipment, which can be upgraded to [[netherite]] armor and equipment. 

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Repairing ===
Diamonds are the repair items for the diamond [[tier]] and [[armor material]], and thus can be used to [[repair]] the following items in an [[anvil]] or [[grindstone]]:
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Helmet}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Chestplate}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Leggings}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Boots}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Sword}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Pickaxe}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Axe}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Shovel}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Hoe}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond Spear}}

=== Beacons ===
Diamonds can be used to select powers from a [[beacon]]. The player must select one of the available powers then insert a diamond into the item slot. 

A diamond can be substituted for an [[iron ingot]], a [[gold ingot]], an [[emerald]] or a [[netherite ingot]].
