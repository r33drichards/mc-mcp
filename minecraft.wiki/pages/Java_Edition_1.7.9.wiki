* Made Minecraft Realms button visible on title screen, but the functions of realms were not introduced yet.

'''Naming system'''
* Improved name conversion speed.

'''[[Skin]] system'''
* Added support for the new skin system.
* Loosened restrictions so NPCs and similar are still possible for now.
* Servers still have to send signed blobs to show skins, but there are no more timeout & "is it for this player" checks.
