'''Coal''' is a mineral [[item]] mainly obtained from [[coal ore]]. It is primarily used for crafting [[torches]] and [[campfire]]s, as well as [[fuel]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Mining ===
[[Coal ore]] when mined using a [[pickaxe]] drops 1 piece of coal. If the pickaxe is enchanted with [[Fortune]], it may drop an extra piece per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of 4 with Fortune III.

== Usage ==

{{crafting usage|Coal}}

=== Fuel ===
When used in a [[furnace]] as a fuel, a piece of coal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), like [[charcoal]]. Coal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than [[wood planks]] or wood logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting {{in|je}}, but outlasted by [[wooden slab]]s {{in|be}}. Though when smelting large amounts of items, converting the coal into a [[Block of Coal]] is even more efficient since 1 block of coal is made out of 9 coal but lasts 10 times as long as coal. 

Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by [[furnace minecart]]s. They provide three minutes of transit each.
