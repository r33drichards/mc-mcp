The '''lava spawner''' was a block that would repeatedly create [[lava]] on each of its four orthogonal sides.

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
Lava spawners can be broken instantly, regardless of held items.

{{Breaking row|Lava Spawner|horizontal=1|foot=1}}

=== Generated loot ===
Lava spawners could be found in [[Starting House]] [[chest]]s in stacks of 99 in in-20100124-2310, and stacks of 100 in in-20100128. Prior to this, they were added to the player's [[inventory]] by default in a stack of 5.

== Usage ==
[[File:Gears on infinite sources.png|thumb|right|As lava spawners are full solid cubes, placed [[gear]]s render on their sides.]]
The lava spawner has many visual and functional differences from normal lava:
* It is a full, solid cube block with full block collision.
* It does not damage entities.
* It does not emit light.
* All sides use the same still lava texture.

=== Creating liquids ===
Immediately after placement, the lava spawner creates blocks of lava on each of its four orthogonal sides. If these created blocks are removed, they get regenerated after enough time.

=== Sponges ===
Unlike with normal lava, lava spawners are deleted by [[sponge]]s.
