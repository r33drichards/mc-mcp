* Added [[Soul Speed]] enchantment.
** A new treasure enchantment only obtainable via [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>gold_ores</code> block and item tags.
** Contains gold ore and nether gold ore.
** Blocks in this tag require an [[iron pickaxe]] or better to be mined.
** Many recipes use this tag.
* Added the <code>piglin_repellents</code> item tag.
** Already existed in the prior snapshots as a block tag, but now extends to items.
** Contains soul fire torches and lanterns.
** [[Piglin]]s don't attempt to pick up items in this tag.
* Added the <code>soul_speed_blocks</code> block tag.
