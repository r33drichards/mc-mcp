A '''barrier''' is an [[invisible block]] used to create solid boundaries.

== Obtaining ==
Barriers cannot be obtained in the creative mode inventory and are only obtainable via commands such as {{cmd|give}}, {{cmd|item}} {{in|java}}, and {{cmd|replaceitem}} and {{cmd|give}} {{in|bedrock}} and cannot be broken in Survival mode.

{{IN|Java}}, barriers are available in the Creative inventory if cheats are enabled and the "Operator Items Tab" setting is turned on.

=== Natural generation ===
In normal worlds, barriers do not generate naturally. {{IN|java}}, they generate as the floor in [[debug mode]] worlds.

== Usage ==
[[File:Shown Invisible Blocks.png|thumb|The difference between air (top left) and barriers (bottom left) when "show invisible blocks" is enabled.]]
Barrier blocks are mainly used to build an impenetrable barrier that cannot be broken in standard Survival mode. For example, they can be used to protect a reserved area from entry by players, mobs, and other entities. Unlike other kinds of unbreakable blocks that could be used for this purpose (such as [[bedrock]]), barrier blocks are unobtrusive because they are invisible. Barrier blocks cannot be destroyed by [[TNT]], [[creeper]] explosions, or any other [[explosion]]s. Furthermore, they have a greater amount of blast resistance than any other unbreakable block.

Unlike other operator blocks such as [[command block]]s, barriers can be placed by players in Survival mode.

In the player's [[inventory]], the block is displayed as a red box with a slash through it, but when placed it is completely invisible.

Barriers are transparent to light and do not block [[beacon]]s. [[Fence]]s, [[iron bars]], [[glass pane]]s, and similar blocks do not visually connect with barriers. Barriers interact with blocks and mobs as a solid block. All dependent blocks can be placed on a barrier, such as [[torch]]es or [[redstone]], and it can suffocate mobs. Mobs cannot spawn on barriers.

In [[Creative]] mode, if a player is holding a barrier block in their hand, all placed barrier blocks display the barrier icon as a [[particle]]. This effect is client-side, and if a player holds a barrier block in Survival mode, the particle does not appear. In ''Java Edition'', barriers take a few seconds to appear and disappear when holding a barrier. In ''Bedrock Edition'', it disappears instantly. Barrier blocks are not shown if the particle setting is set to "minimal".

=== Waterlogging ===
Barrier blocks can be waterlogged by being placed into a water source block or by manually {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on them. {{IN|java}}, water cannot be placed in them or taken out by non-direct interactions such as [[dispenser]]s; this is allowed {{in|bedrock}}. {{IN|java}}, only players in Creative mode can waterlog or remove water from barriers, while {{in|bedrock}} there are no game mode restrictions. {{IN|java}}, water does not flow out of waterlogged barriers. See [[waterlogging]] for more details on what blocks can be waterlogged.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Barriers cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

== Trivia ==
* The symbol used is not compliant with [[Wikipedia:ISO 3864-1|ISO 3864-1]], as the diagonal line is mirrored.<ref>{{bug|MC-64322|resolution=WAI}}</ref>
* The barrier's vanilla block model defines only what texture to use for block breaking particles, and it does not have a parent model or anything that would give the block a physical shape.
* Barriers are hardcoded to not render any block model.<ref>{{bug|MC-131775}}</ref>
