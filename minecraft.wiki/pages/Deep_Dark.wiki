The '''deep dark''' is a [[cave biome]] that generates deep underground in the [[Overworld]] under [[Mountains|mountainous]] areas.

== Description ==
The deep dark is a [[Biome#Cave biomes|cave biome]] that generates deep underground beneath areas with a low [[World generation#Biomes|erosion]] value. The deep dark usually stays within the [[deepslate]] layer, although it can occasionally reach into the [[stone]] layer. Rarely, it can generate at up to y=124.

The biomes the deep dark generates under are the ones with the least [[World generation#Biomes|erosion]] and high altitudes. These are:

* Most often: [[jagged peaks]], [[stony peaks]], [[frozen peaks]], [[snowy slopes]], and [[grove]]s
* Often (plateaus): [[cherry grove]]s, [[meadow]]s, and [[savanna plateau]]s
* Less often: under [[badlands]], [[wooded badlands]], and [[eroded badlands]]
* Never: [[ocean]]s, [[river]]s, [[swamp]]s or [[desert]]s.

The deep dark is covered in large patches of [[sculk]] blocks surrounded by [[sculk vein]]s, which include sculk-related blocks such as [[sculk shrieker]]s, [[sculk sensor]]s and [[sculk catalyst]]s.

The biome is dimly lit; there is almost no [[glow lichen]], with the only natural light sources being sculk catalysts and [[lava]]. No [[mob]]s spawn in this biome (but [[monster room]]s can still spawn mobs<ref>{{bug|MC-249361||Dungeons can spawn in the deep dark, potentially distracting the upcoming warden|WAI}}</ref>.) However, the [[warden]] may appear if four [[Sculk Shrieker|shriekers]] are triggered, giving the player the [[Darkness]] effect.
	
The deep dark is the only biome where [[ancient cities]] can generate. Other structures and features that can be found in the deep dark include [[monster room]]s, [[stronghold]]s, and [[amethyst geode]]s. [[Mineshaft]]s and [[trial chambers]] never generate in a deep dark biome, although they may extend into one.

The deep dark can be a great biome for mining [[diamond]]s since they are most frequent at the deepest layers of the world and generate less frequently when exposed to air which the [[sculk]] protects them from. The [[sculk]] floors and walls can easily be destroyed with a [[hoe]], yielding a large amount of [[experience]], effective for hoes with [[Mending]].

While certain [[ore]]s that are exposed to [[air]] blocks have a chance to not generate, sculk blocks are considered a solid block during generation, causing many ores to be revealed under it. Other mobs do not spawn, so the warden is the only threat, which can be safely avoided by destroying all nearby shriekers.

== Issues ==

== Trivia ==
* The deep dark was originally "going to feel like an underwater biome, but with the water missing" along with "lots of floating jellyfish in the air and ghostly looking blocks." White, orange, teal, and lime green were some of the color themes meant for the deep dark. In these versions, the only source of light would have been bioluminescent blocks.<ref>{{ytl|Z4haZTbU9ZA|The Secrets of Minecraft's Deep Dark @ 2:57|Minecraft|June 24, 2022|t=177s}}</ref>
* If a [[single biome]] world is generated using the deep dark as the biome, it appears similar to a [[plains]] world with [[sculk]] patches present across the world's surface. [[Sculk shrieker]]s can spawn anywhere, making the [[warden]] a near constant threat. No other mobs spawn, with these exceptions:
** [[Pillager patrol]]s and [[phantom]]s still spawn naturally.
** [[Silverfish]] spawn via naturally generated [[infested stone bricks]].
** [[Bee]]s spawn via naturally generated [[beehive]]s.
* In a few images shown by [[Kingbdogz]] during the [[The Wild Update|1.19]] development cycle showed [[fossil]]s generating in this [[biome]] covered in [[sculk vein]]s which was confirmed to have been something they were "just testing out", and it never made it into the game.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1499449439756431363|Just to calm your expectations: the bone blocks are a test where we were seeing what it would look like if normal fossils might generate in the Deep Dark exposed. No idea if we'll actually use that idea.|March 3, 2022}}</ref>
