'''Nether wart''' is a fungus harvested from Nether wart crops and is used to plant them. It is an essential ingredient in almost every [[potion]]. Unlike other crimson plants, Nether wart doesn't have a warped equivalent, although [[warped wart block]]s exist.

'''Nether wart crops''' are found in [[Nether fortress]]es and [[bastion remnant]]s and used to grow Nether wart in [[soul sand]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Nether wart can be mined instantly with any tool. A fully mature Nether wart crop yields 2&ndash;4 Nether wart. This is increased by one for each level of [[Fortune]], this allows for a maximum of 7 Nether warts dropping from one crop. Less mature stages drop one Nether wart, even with the Fortune enchantment.

{{breaking row|Nether Wart|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Nether wart can generate in [[Nether fortress]]es in [[soul sand]] gardens around stairwells or in [[chest]]s. Nether wart can also generate in the courtyards of housing unit [[bastion remnant]]s. Because it only spawns in these specific structures, it's possible for a Nether fortress or bastion remnant to generate without Nether wart, though Nether wart may still be in chests in the fortress or bastion.

== Usage == 
=== Brewing ingredient ===
Nether wart's primary purpose is to [[Brewing|brew]] the [[awkward potion]], the base for all potions, but optional for Weakness.

=== Farming ===
{{main|Tutorial:Nether Wart farming}}
When planted on [[soul sand]], Nether wart grows through four stages, though the middle two stages use the same texture (the hitbox of stage 3 is three pixels taller). {{IN|java}}, the exact age can be seen using the [[debug screen]], and the ages range from 0 to 3. Each random tick, Nether wart has a 10% chance of growing one stage. At default random tick speed, each Nether wart grows one age step approximately every {{convert|13653|ticks|minutes}} on average, and fully grows from planting to harvest every {{convert|40960|ticks|minutes}} on average. The growth rate is not affected by light or any other environmental factors. [[Bone meal]] cannot be used on the Nether wart.

Nether wart can only be planted on [[soul sand]]. It cannot be planted on [[soul soil]]. It can grow in any [[dimension]].

Nether wart is ready to harvest when it reaches its fourth stage (age:3). Breaking a fully grown Nether wart drops 2 to 4 Nether wart, while an immature one drops a single Nether wart. Using a tool enchanted with fortune increases the maximum number of Nether wart dropped by 1 per level, for a maximum of 7 for a tool enchanted with [[Fortune|Fortune III]].

When Nether wart is harvested, it always drops onto the block of soul sand in which it was growing, unlike other plants, which can fall outside those boundaries.

=== Composting ===
Placing a Nether wart into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Note that one should preferably not craft Nether wart blocks for composting purposes. Using 9 Nether warts gives almost 95% chance of raising the compost level at least 4 times, while using a Nether wart block gives an 85% chance of raising it once.
