{{exclusive|java}}

The '''legacy solid''' [[block property]], usually simply called '''solid''', determines if a block is considered "solid" for a number of game mechanics. It is distinct from many other notions of solidity, such as whether the block is [[opaque]], [[conductive]], has a [[collision box]], is a [[full block]], or allows [[mob spawning]].

The '''blocks motion''' block property, also sometimes called '''blocks movement''', '''motion-blocking''', or '''movement-blocking''', is nearly synonymous with ''legacy solid'', with two exceptions: [[cobweb]]s and [[bamboo sapling]]s are ''legacy solid'', but they are not ''motion-blocking''. Since the two properties are so similar, it can be useful to consider ''motion-blocking'' a variant of ''legacy solid'' rather than a truly distinct property. As such, this article describes the effects of both variants.

Many gameplay mechanics are affected by the ''legacy solid'' property, including support for certain attached blocks like [[candles]], conversion of [[farmland]] to [[dirt]], destruction of [[cactus]], summoning of [[iron golem]]s, and [[pathfinding]]. Additionally, the ''blocks motion'' property influences random [[teleportation]] and certain [[fluid]] mechanics.

== Effects ==

{{Missing information|section|portal generation, and world generation}}

Both ''legacy solid'' and ''blocks motion'' are arguably misnomers, as many so-called solid blocks do not have [[collision]], do not graphically appear solid, and do not obstruct movement. Rather, these properties exclusively affect the (largely unrelated) game mechanics described in this section.

As the word ''legacy'' in ''legacy solid'' implies, these properties tend to be used by older game mechanics that predate introduction of other, more granular block properties. In some cases, their continued use may intentionally preserve historical behavior so as not to break players' designs.

=== Support, placement, and survival conditions ===

[[Item frame]]s, [[glow item frame]]s, and [[painting]]s can only be supported by ''legacy solid'' blocks and the side faces of [[redstone repeater]]s and [[redstone comparator]]s. [[Banner]]s, [[sign]]s, and [[cake]]s can only be supported by ''legacy solid'' blocks. Other attached blocks, including but not limited to [[torch]]es, [[button]]s, [[hanging sign]]s, and, [[ladder]]s, use other mechanisms to determine whether they have sufficient support and are '''not''' affected by the ''legacy solid'' property.<ref>https://joakimthorsen.github.io/MCPropertyEncyclopedia/?selection=placement_condition&filter=(placement_condition:No)</ref>

[[Cactus]] cannot be placed horizontally adjacent to any ''legacy solid'' block, and it uproots and drops as an item if a ''legacy solid'' block is placed horizontally adjacent to it.

[[Dirt path]] converts to dirt if any ''legacy solid'' block other than a [[fence gate]] is immediately above it. [[Farmland]] converts to dirt if any ''legacy solid'' block other than a fence gate or [[moving piston]] is immediately above it.

=== Fluid flow ===
{{Main|Fluid#Flow direction}}

Flowing [[water]] that is adjacent to two water source blocks will only form a new [[Water#Source_blocks|source]] above ''legacy solid'' blocks or other water sources.

[[File:Water flow with motion blocking.jpg|thumb|The upper water source block flows towards the bottom-left source block, but not the bottom-right, because [[glass]] ''blocks motion'' but [[ladder]]s do not.]]

A fluid will only [[Fluid#Spread|spread]] towards other blocks it can flow into, but the shape and flow direction of each specific fluid block is affected by which blocks around it are ''motion-blocking''. This means that if a fluid is trying to flow down to a diagonally adjacent fluid of the same type, but is prevented from doing so by a ''non-motion-blocking'' block, then the shape and flow direction of the top fluid will behave as if it still could.

=== Iron golem summoning ===
{{Main|Iron golem#Spawning}}

[[Iron golem]]s summoned by panicking [[villager]]s can only spawn on top of ''legacy solid'' blocks or [[powder snow]]. However, there are several exceptions: iron golems are explicitly prohibited from spawning on top of [[cactus]], [[glass]] (including [[stained glass]], [[tinted glass]], and their [[glass pane]] variants), [[leaves]], [[conduit]]s, [[ice]], [[TNT]], [[glowstone]], [[beacon]]s, [[sea lantern]]s, or [[frosted ice]], even though all of those blocks have the ''legacy solid'' property.

For historical reasons, the set of blocks naturally summoned iron golems may spawn on top of are sometimes referred to as '''solid-blocking'''.<!-- Specifically, that term was one of the properties defined by the old [[materials]] system. However, as of Java Edition 1.20.4, this set of blocks is only used for iron golem spawning via the quite explicitly named LEGACY_IRON_GOLEM spawn strategy. -->

=== Random wandering and teleportation ===

When [[mobs]] select a random target destination to walk, swim, or fly to, the selected destination is adjusted upwards until it is not inside of any ''legacy solid'' block.

When a [[dolphin]] checks to see if it can jump, it checks certain blocks along the path of the jump to ensure the path is clear. If the blocks are ''motion-blocking'' or do not contain [[water]], the jump fails.

When an [[enderman]] teleports, a player teleports by eating a [[chorus fruit]], or a [[cat]] teleports just before giving the player a morning gift, the y [[coordinate]] of the selected destination is lowered until the block immediately below it ''blocks motion''. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition: the selected destination also must not collide with any blocks or fluids, otherwise the teleportation attempt fails.

=== Breaking ice ===

When [[ice]] is broken above a ''motion-blocking'' block or a [[fluid]], the ice is replaced with a [[water]] source block. Otherwise, the ice is simply destroyed and replaced with air like any other block.

=== Heightmaps ===

Only blocks that are ''motion-blocking'' will be considered as part of the <code>OCEAN_FLOOR</code> and <code>OCEAN_FLOOR_WG</code> [[heightmap]]s. It is also used to determine the <code>MOTION_BLOCKING</code> heightmap, with the exception of any block that does not have an empty fluid state (meaning that [[fluid]]s and [[waterlogging|waterlogged blocks]] are excluded). The <code>MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES</code> has the additional exception of [[leaves]].

These heightmaps are used for various mechanics related to sky exposure (like [[weather]] and [[ice]] formation), underwater [[feature]] placement (like [[kelp]] patches and [[ocean ruins]]), [[mob spawning]], and [[world generation]] (like making sure underground features like [[fossils]] and [[buried treasure]] are placed below the ocean floor).
