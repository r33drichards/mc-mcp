A '''skeleton horse''' is an [[undead]] skeletal [[horse]] that sometimes spawns when [[lightning]] strikes as a [[hostile mob]]. Despite being undead, it does not burn in [[sunlight]].

A '''skeleton horseman''' is an [[iron helmet]]-wearing [[skeleton]] that rides and controls a skeleton horse, which becomes [[passive]] once separated from its rider.

== Spawning ==
{{anchor|Skeleton trap}}

A "skeleton trap" horse is a skeleton horse spawned from a fraction of [[lightning]] generated naturally by a [[thunderstorm]] (0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.25–6.75% on Hard [[difficulty]], depending on [[regional difficulty]]). {{IN|java}}, the lightning that spawns a trap horse doesn't strike nearby entities or spawn [[fire]]s. Lightning strikes created from a [[Channeling]]-enchanted [[trident]] and lightning strikes directed to a [[lightning rod]] ''never'' spawn a skeleton trap horse. The trap horse despawns after <abbr title="18,000 ticks">15 minutes</abbr> if not triggered (even if it is named). Trap horses will spawn in any biome where it can rain, even the [[mushroom fields]] and the [[deep dark]].<ref>{{bug|MC-305630||Skeleton horse traps can spawn in any biome where it can rain, including deep dark and mushroom fields}}</ref>{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

{{IN|je}}, skeleton horses do not spawn in Peaceful [[difficulty]], like hostile mobs.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

Baby skeleton horses cannot spawn naturally.

=== Skeleton Horseman ===
{{redirect|Skeleton Horseman|the powerful mob in {{MCD}}|Dungeons:Skeleton Horseman}}

The skeleton trap horse is triggered when a [[player]] approaches within 10 blocks of it, resulting in a lightning strike that does not start fires or damage nearby entities. When struck, the skeleton trap horse transforms into a '''skeleton horseman''': a [[skeleton]] riding a skeleton horse. It also spawns three additional skeleton horsemen in the vicinity.

The skeleton rider is equipped with an [[enchanted]] [[iron helmet]] along with an enchanted [[bow]]. Like regular skeletons, they also have a chance to spawn with various pieces of armor or with the ability to pick up equipment on the ground. The skeleton riders are always regular skeletons, and never spawn as [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], [[parched]], or [[wither skeleton]]s. Like the horses themselves, the skeleton riders are persistent, meaning they do not despawn unless the difficulty is set to "Peaceful".

{{IN|java}}, both the horse and rider have [[Damage#Immunity|damage immunity]] for 3 seconds after spawning. {{IN|bedrock}}, both the horse and rider are always immune to lightning. Once its skeleton rider is killed, the skeleton horse becomes completely passive, allowing for it to be ridden.

A skeleton trap horse, and therefore skeleton horsemen, can also be manually spawned using [[command]]s:

'''Java Edition'''<br>
{{cmd|/summon skeleton_horse ~ ~ ~ {SkeletonTrap:1}<nowiki/>}}

'''Bedrock Edition'''<br>
{{cmd|/summon skeleton_horse ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:set_trap}}.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Bone|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a player or [[tamed wolf]].
If saddled, it drops a saddle.{{only|java}}

Killing a baby skeleton horse yields no items or experience. {{IN|bedrock}}, killing a trap skeleton horse also yields no items or experience.

== Behavior ==
{{Infobox entity

}}
The skeleton horse is an undead mob that spawns and triggers a "skeleton trap" if the player gets too close. Once the skeleton rider is defeated, the skeleton horse becomes completely passive. Skeleton horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike [[sheep]], the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Skeleton horses can breathe in water.

{{IN|bedrock}}, skeleton horses prevent players from sleeping,<ref>{{bug|MCPE-172928||Cannot sleep with Skeleton Horse nearby}}</ref> and are targeted by the [[conduit]] like any regular hostile mob, even while tamed.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-175996||Conduits damage skeleton horses|Won't Fix}}</ref>{{until|BE 26.0}}

Skeleton horses can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Skeleton horses also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}). If an entity is riding a skeleton horse, they receive the same fall damage as the skeleton horse.

Skeleton horses have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

Unlike most passive mobs, skeleton horses don't panic when damaged.{{upcoming|JE 26.1|BE 26.0}}

Skeleton horses cannot be [[breed|bred]].

Other notes:
* The skeleton wears an iron helmet, unless it randomly spawned with some other headgear.
* The skeleton's bow and helmet are enchanted as if on an [[enchanting table]] at level 5–22. The exact level depends on [[regional difficulty]]; on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.
* The skeleton trap horse and the skeleton horse in a jockey are always adults.
* The skeleton in a naturally spawned skeleton horseman jockey does not despawn.
* A trap horse may spawn in areas that a regular horse may not, such as the middle of an ocean.
* A trap horse can trigger normally in clear weather (and often a player encounters a trap horse after the thunderstorm has cleared).
* The skeleton drops more experience orbs.
* The skeleton does not attack any mob that attacks the skeleton horse.

Differences/inconsistencies of skeleton horses with other undead mounts, such as [[zombie horse]]s, [[camel husk]]s, and [[zombie nautilus]]es:
*It count for the passive mob cap instead of the hostile mob cap.<ref>{{bug|MC-304371||Skeleton horses use the incorrect mob cap}}</ref>
*It is not valid for [[advancement]]s.<ref name="bug">{{bug|MC-303546||Zombie horses and zombie nautiluses count towards the "Monster Hunter" and "Monsters Hunted" advancements while skeleton horses don't|WAI}}</ref>
*It can still be leashed and fed with horse food items when ridden by hostile mobs.<ref>{{bug|MC-304372||Skeleton horses can be interacted when ridden by hostile mobs}}</ref>
*It cannot be tamed normally, as its tamed by default when the trap triggers.
*A skeleton horse spawned via a [[spawn egg]] can not be tamed or ridden.<ref>{{bug|MC-102949||Can't interact with a skeleton and a zombie horse that have been spawned from a spawn egg}}</ref>
*Its health and stats are not variable.<ref>{{bug|MC-188404||Naturally spawned skeleton horses do not have randomized stats}}</ref>
*It cannot wear [[horse armor]].<ref>{{bug|MC-304394||Skeleton Horses can't wear armor|Works As Intended}}</ref>
*[[Parrot]]s can't imitate them.<ref>{{bug|MC-304373||Parrots don't imitate skeleton horses, endermen and zombified piglins}}</ref>

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* ignored by the [[wither]].
* affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* a threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Skeleton horses are [[monster]]s, and as such, will never spawn if the [[game rule]] {{cd|spawn_monsters}} is set to false.<ref name="monster">{{bug|MC-89064||Lightning spawns Skeleton Horse when doMobSpawning/spawn-monsters is false.|Fixed}}</ref>

As they are under the {{cd|skeletons}} [[Entity type tag (Java Edition)|entity type tag]], [[creeper]]s drop  a [[music disc]] when killed by a skeleton horse. This can be done with the following command:
{{cmd|damage @n[type{{=}}creeper] 100 generic by @n[type{{=}}skeleton_horse]}}

=== Taming ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, the skeleton horse is always [[tame]]d. {{IN|java}}, a skeleton trap horse becomes tamed when struck by [[lightning]]. The other three skeleton horses are tamed when they are spawned.

{{IN|java}}, with the use of commands, a skeleton horse can be tamed in the same way as a regular horse, granting the [[Best Friends Forever]] advancement.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult skeleton horse to form a [[jockey]], if the skeleton horse has no riders.

== Statistics ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Horses}}

All horses have three "equine stats" that vary from horse to horse: health, maximum movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the horse is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.

=== Spawned values ===
When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands, spawning naturally, spawning as part of a skeleton trap, or using spawn eggs – horses are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.

==== Health ====
A skeleton horse's health is always 15. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A horse with an odd number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart. If the horse has lost one health point lower than the inflicted damage and did not regenerate, it has an odd number of health points, otherwise, it has an even number of health points.

==== Movement speed ====
Skeleton horse's speed is always 0.2;
the player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any [[status effect]] that affects the speed of a horse or a player.

See ''[[Transportation#Methods|transportation]]'' to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.

==== Jump strength ====
Jump strength ranges from 0.4–1.0, averaging 0.7.

A jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear {{frac|1|19|32}} blocks, while 1.0 is enough to clear {{frac|5|9|32}} blocks.

The jump strengths required to clear several block heights are:
{| class="wikitable" data-description="Jump strength"
! Jump Strength
! Blocks
|-
| 0.967||5.00
|-
| 0.848||4.00
|-
| 0.716||3.00
|-
| 0.565||2.00
|-
| 0.431||1.25 (player's jump height)
|}

== Usage ==
{{see also|Transportation}}

As with normal horses, skeleton horses can be ridden by a player. When ridden, they can be used to climb hills and jump fences because the skeleton horses can jump up to five block heights, versus the player's maximum of one (without jump boost).

Skeleton horses can be ridden in water at any depth without forcing the player to dismount. They sink to the bottom and can be ridden along the ocean or river floor.

Skeleton horses can be pulled or tethered with a [[lead]].

=== Equipment ===
[[File:Skeleton Horse GUI.png|thumb|right|GUI of a skeleton horse.{{only|JE|short=1}}]]
; {{el|java}}
Skeleton horses have the following slot available:
* {{SlotSprite|Saddle}} Saddle Slot: For equipping a [[saddle]].

Saddles can be placed on a tamed skeleton horse by holding it and then {{control|using}} on the skeleton horse, or by accessing its inventory. A skeleton horse’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the skeleton horse and using {{control|inventory}} control, or by {{control|sneaking}} and then {{control|using}} on the skeleton horse. 

The saddle can be removed by two methods:
* Removing the saddle from its slot in the skeleton horse's inventory.
* {{ctrl|Using}} [[shears]] on the skeleton horse.

Baby skeleton horses cannot be equipped, as they cannot be ridden.

; {{el|bedrock}}
A skeleton horse does not have an inventory and cannot be equipped with a saddle or horse armor. Despite this, the default texture file, like those of normal horses, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s, includes a chest.

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, skeleton horses can be controlled by the player without a saddle. {{IN|java}}, skeleton horses must be equipped with a saddle to be controlled. Like riding other entities, a player can travel into a [[nether portal]] or [[end portal]] while on a skeleton horse.

The player can control a tamed (and saddled {{el|java}}) skeleton horse with standard directional controls, {{control|jump}}, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control.

A player controlled skeleton horse automatically runs up any one block high slope. The skeleton horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Skeleton horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

Player controlled skeleton horses have the ability of "jumping charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on [[HUD]] is replaced by jumping charging bar. A controlled skeleton horse can be made to {{control|jump}} and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Skeleton horses are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.

Unlike normal horses, a skeleton horse does not force the player to dismount when it is under [[water]]; rather, it can be ridden underwater without drowning. The player can still drown underwater without the proper potions or enchantments, even when mounted on the skeleton horse. When underwater, its running speed and jump remain the same although it has a slower rate of descent.
