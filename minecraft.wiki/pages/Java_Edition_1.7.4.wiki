While it was not the last update to 1.7, it was the last one before the snapshots of [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]] started. This is the final version released in 2013.

A [[Java Edition 1.7.4 (pre-release)|pre-release for 1.7.4]] was released on December 9, 2013;<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|410022933323849728|We've pre-released a new version of Minecraft, 1.7.4, to fix some crashes.

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Chicken Jockey Revision 1.png|32px]] [[Chicken jockey]]'''
* Consists of a [[baby zombie]] riding and controlling a [[chicken]].
** Because the zombie is riding a chicken, it cannot take [[fall damage]].
** As it is a baby zombie, it does not burn up if exposed to [[daylight]].
* Extremely rare - every baby zombie spawned has a very small chance of spawning as a chicken jockey.
* [[File:Chicken Zombie Villager Jockey.png|32px]] [[Baby zombie villager]] chicken jockeys consist of a baby zombie villager riding a chicken.
* [[File:Chicken Zombie Pigman Jockey Revision 1.png|32px]] [[Zombie pigmen]] chicken jockeys can spawn in the [[Nether]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Shader]]s'''
* New 'Notch' shader.

=== General ===
'''Native broadcasting to <span class="plainlinks">[[Twitch]]</span>'''
* Microphone can be recorded too.
* Twitch chat integration in the game.

'''Twitch related [[Options#Broadcast Settings|settings]]'''
* Broadcast settings:
** Quality, framerate, bandwidth, send metadata, mic volume, system volume, compression, enable chat, and user filter (for the twitch chat).

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Sheep]]'''
* Sheep with the custom name "jeb_" change their color, fading between all 16 [[wool]] colors.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1seluj/rainbow_sheep_anyone_know_how_long_this_has_been/</ref>
** Commonly referred to as "rainbow sheep", "disco sheep", or "Jeb sheep".
** Color changes are visual effects only; does not affect wool drops.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Attribute]]'''
* The Sharpness enchantment now affects the "attack damage" attribute.

'''Rideable entities'''
* When dismounting entities, players are no longer moved as far.

'''Tab key'''
* If all auto-completable options begin the same, tab fills up the beginning - example: {{cmd|gamerule doM}} completes to {{cmd|gamerule doMob}}.

=== General ===
'''Mojang splash screen'''
* The logo has been changed so now it's red instead of red-orange, has 2 square corners, and the rounded corners are rounder. The text is now black instead of orange, the font weight is lighter (bold instead of black), and the face appears to be a custom hybrid of Insignia and Code pro.<!-- Look closely at the screen when minecraft is loading-->
* The Mojang splash screen is now hard-coded and can no longer be changed in [[resource pack]]s.

'''[[Minecraft Realms]]'''
* Servers now have an icon which is the face of the owner's [[skin]].
* Config screen is modified and layout is changed.
