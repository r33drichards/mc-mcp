== Removals ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Commands]]'''
* Removed command {{cmd|home}}.

== Fixes ==
'''5 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed a memory leak bug in the server.
* Riding carts and boats now works properly when the player travel long distances.
* Harvesting crops no longer yields fake [[Wheat Seeds|seeds]].
* Snowballs are given again.
* Fixed a door bug; doors would not close properly or get stuck open.</onlyinclude>

== Bugs ==
* In this version and [[Alpha v1.2.6]], if the [[player]]'s name is not set properly (which occurs in the modern [[launcher]]), they are always named "Player524". This makes multiplayer in this version impossible without the use of third-party tools, as two players cannot join a server with the same name.
