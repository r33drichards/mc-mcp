[[File:All Walls.png|thumb|All walls.]]
A '''wall''' is a decorative [[block]]. Like [[fence]]s, they can be used to create boundaries, because players and most [[mob]]s cannot climb or jump over them.

== Variants ==
There are 26 variants of walls:

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
All walls have the same crafting recipe shape, with six blocks of the same type resulting in six walls of the same type.

=== Stonecutting ===
All walls can be obtained by stonecutting. As with crafting, each used block results in one crafted wall.

== Usage ==
[[File:FloatingRabbit.png|thumb|right|Due to the wall's hitboxes being 1.5 blocks tall for mobs, this [[rabbit]] could be seen "floating".]]
Walls are one and a half [[block]]s tall for [[player]] or [[mob]] collisions, and one block tall for all other purposes, similar to [[fence]]s. This prevents [[player]]s and mobs from jumping over them, while using only one actual block space. A wall occupies the center space of blocks.

A wall block connects to side and top blocks in three ways:
* A wall block automatically connects to any horizontally adjacent connectable block surface, [[bars]] or [[glass pane]]. Although they connect horizontally to [[bars]] and [[glass pane]]s, they do not connect horizontally to [[fence]]s ([[fence gate]]s can be connected though).<ref>{{bug|MC-179830|||WAI}}</ref>
* The top of a connect-to-side part rises slightly to support any block immediately above if it covers the 2-pixel-wide area on the wall top from the four pixels at the center to the connected side.
* A wall block always has a center post connecting to the top if covered by a [[banner]], a [[pressure plate]], a ground [[torch]], [[soul torch]] or [[redstone torch]], a [[sign]], [[tripwire]], another wall block with a center post, or any block covering the four pixels at the center on its top ''without'' making the wall block raise its top on any two opposite sides.<ref>https://joakimthorsen.github.io/MCPropertyEncyclopedia/?selection=variants,tag_wall_post_override&filter=(tag_wall_post_override:No)</ref>

A wall block has a center post even if not covered by the blocks mentioned above, unless connecting to ''only two opposite sides'' or ''all four sides''. Without center posts, walls connect to other walls to create a large, flat wall.

Wall blocks are more efficient at fencing off mobs than a two-block high wall of regular blocks, costing half as many blocks, and being more space-efficient as well. However, a [[skeleton]] might shoot over the wall, a [[creeper]] could explode if a player is standing near the wall, a [[spider]] could still climb over the wall, and a [[camel]] can walk over the wall.

Unlike fences, if two walls are placed one block apart diagonally, the player cannot walk between them.

=== Note blocks ===
Walls can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Redstone ===
Walls can be used to give block updates (post placement updates {{in|je}}) to other walls under it when connected to another block; the walls under the connected wall will change the block state that controls the center post to the same state as the wall above if the wall above makes the wall below raise its top on any two opposite sides, which can be detected by an observer.  This sort of redstone is called wallstone.
