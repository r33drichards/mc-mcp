'''Minecraft is turning 15 | Come celebrate with us!''' is a promotional trailer, announcing the [[15 Days of Minecraft]] event.

== Summary ==
In a void of green, neon blocks, a 15 appears. As it does, a large assortment of [[Mob|mobs]], from [[Bee|bees]] to [[Noor]], as an announcer narrates that ''Minecraft'' is turning 15 in 2024. As an [[Iron Golem|iron golem]] lights several [[Firework Rocket|fireworks]] for [[Villager|baby villagers]] and an [[allay]], the announcer elaborates, saying that there are "presents" as a [[sheep]] cartwheels quite impressively. Describing it as a "blocktacular celebration," ''Minecraft'' is going to announce fifteen things across fifteen days to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the game ''Minecraft''. As this is explained, many things happen, such as a [[goat]] leaping onto a [[button]] that releases a flock of [[Parrot|parrots]], revealing a [[Character Creator|crafting cap]], and a [[warden]] does what appears to be a dance with a [[sniffer]].

After a [[cat]] awkwardly violates a [[creeper]]'s personal space, [[Alex]] dances around a [[Nether portal|Nether Portal]], tossing around [[Gold Nugget|gold nuggets]] as a [[piglin]] emerges, its interest piqued. An iron golem invites the camera into a hallway protected by an [[Iron Door|iron door]], where a [[spyglass]] is placed on the ground. Using it, it is revealed that, on the opposite end of the hallway, is a [[pillager]] also using a [[spyglass]], who runs away in fear upon being spotted. As the camera recedes down another path, a statue resembling [[Steve]] is shown, and looks away. The announcer promises "weird stuff," seguing into a room of skeletons dancing, who get disturbed by the intrusion and almost shoot the camera. The announcer and camera then move on to a picture of [[Jens Bergensten|Jens]] looking at a [[Hanging Sign|hanging sign]] in a [[Boat with Chest|boat with a chest]], which the announcer clarifies we are not meant to see and blurs.

The scene transitions into a study area, where a [[hoglin]] is resting, surrounded by various [[redstone]] blocks crafting [[Cake|cakes]]. A chest opens up, briefly revealing the [[Experience Mod LLC]] logo, before the camera is quickly ejected from the room and cut off by a goat closing the door. That same goat proceeds to break many of the creeper-like blocks encasing everyone, creating a tunnel that leads to an enderman. An [[arrow]] is shot at a [[Decorated Pot|decorated pot]], as a [[bat]] flies over to some villagers and an [[Wolf Armor|armored]] [[wolf]] around a [[campfire]]. The announcer promises that "it will be a blast," causing a [[frog]] to emerge and swallow the camera whole. Inside of the frog, it is revealed there is a [[Kelp (feature)|kelp forest]], with many [[Tropical Fish|tropical fish]], [[Glow Squid|glow squids]], and a [[pufferfish]].

The camera zooms out again, revealing Alex was reading a popup [[book]] of the previous scenes on a [[lectern]]. As she flips through various pages, a creeper emerges from inside the book, causing her to close the book and throw it away in a panic, right before it explodes. As the announcer announces "the ultimate ''Minecraft'' party and you're invited," many other mobs appear, including [[Steve]], [[Efe]], and [[Sunny]]. [[Zuri]] swoops in with [[elytra]], as the camera tunnels through another set of blocks as more and more mobs appear, before revealing the logo of the anniversary.
