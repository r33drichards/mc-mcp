'''Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3''' is the third pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.0.0]], released on October 6, 2011, which adds five new blocks including the [[brewing stand]] and [[enchantment table]], as well as the [[eye of ender]], five baby animal variants, [[experience]] levels, the [[enchantment glint]] effect, and completed [[potion]] mechanics.

The original version of the Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 was released shortly before 14:57 UTC on October 6 and included a debug feature where players spawned with full stacks of enchantment tables, [[bookshelves]], [[End portal frame]]s, and [[End portal block]]s in the hotbar.

Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3 was reuploaded at around 15:08 UTC, removing the debug blocks in the hotbar.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|121950027227734016|Third time's the charm! Minecraft Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3: http://assets.minecraft.net/1_9-pre3/minecraft.jar|6 Oct 2011}} (15:08 UTC)</ref>

== Technical ==
=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Added pie chart detailing CPU usage.

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed [[snow golem]]s being able to enter love mode.
* Fixed killing a player with a [[dispenser]] from crashing the server.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|120967470646439936|@Lladar @notch Ok thanks, fixed it|October 3, 2011}}</ref></onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* Due to a bug, multiplayer servers generate [[sky dimension]] chunks starting in this version. The biome of these chunks is random if saved in multiplayer, however, if they are saved in singleplayer, they change to [[plains]] biomes, no matter if snow had generated in the chunks. This was fixed by [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]].
