'''16w42a''' is the twelfth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on October 19, 2016<ref name="blogpost 16w42a">https://www.mojang.com/2016/10/minecraft-snapshot-16w42a/</ref> mainly to fix a bunch of bugs and crashes.

== Changes ==
'''[[Arrow]]s'''
* Now have a <code>crit</code> tag which determines whether the arrow deals [[critical hit]] damage.

'''[[Vex]]es'''
* Now do more damage - their attack damage on Easy has been increased from {{hp|3}} to {{hp|5}}, on Normal {{hp|4}} to {{hp|9}}, and on Hard {{hp|6}} to {{hp|13}}.
