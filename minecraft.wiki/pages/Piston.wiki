A '''piston''' is a [[block]] capable of pushing most [[entities]] and blocks when given a [[redstone]] signal. 

Some blocks cannot be moved, break when pushed or have other interactions with pistons. A piston can move up to twelve blocks at once.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A piston can be broken using any [[tool]] with equal efficiency, and always drops itself.
It is faster to break them with a [[pickaxe]]. The pickaxe is also the preferred tool for breaking the head when extended.<ref>{{bug|MC-171370|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Redstone component ===
Pistons are always placed facing toward the player. When powered, the piston's wooden surface (the "head") tries to start extending after a [[#Start delay|start delay]]. The extension takes {{convert|2|game tick|second}} to finish. When it extends, it pushes at most 12 blocks. The piston makes a sound that can be heard within a 31×31×31 cube centered on the activating piston. Any entities in the path of an extending piston (or any block it might be moving) are pushed along, when possible. If the entities cannot be moved, the block is pushed inside them, suffocating [[mob]]s when pushed into their [[eye height]] (assuming said block is solid).

When a piston loses power, its head retracts. Like the extension, the retraction starts after a [[#Start delay|start delay]] and takes {{convert|2|game tick|second}} to finish.

A piston that pushes a [[slime block]] bounces any entity that it displaces in the direction the piston is facing. Entities on top of a moving [[honey block]], or any other moving block,{{only|bedrock|short=1}} will also move with it. In addition, when a slime block or a honey block is moved by a piston, any movable block adjacent (not diagonally) to it also moves. See the "[[#Slime blocks and honey blocks|Slime blocks and honey blocks]]" section of this page for more details.

{{IN|be}}, blocks that require a support (such as levers) can be placed on the back or sides of a piston without being destroyed when that piston extends. {{IN|je}}, on the other hand, the majority of blocks that require a support are only safe to place on the back of pistons.

==== Soft inversion ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
When a piston that has a [[redstone torch]] attached to it is powered, the redstone torch turns off—and when said piston is depowered, the redstone torch turns back on: this mechanic is known by the community as ''[[soft inversion]]''.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-17909|||WF}}</ref><ref>"Explaining soft inversion: the Minecraft Bedrock Redstone bug that won't get fixed" – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUgKXTsLOA0</ref> Since soft inversion works even if the piston is being powered indirectly through a block, it can be used to toggle the state of a redstone torch from farther away compared to other powering methods. It's still possible to take advantage of soft inversion even if the piston cannot extend or retract.

==== Start delay ====
A piston won't extend or retract immediately when it is activated: this phenomenon is known as "start delay".

{{IN|be}}, the start delay is fixed at {{convert|2|game tick|second}}, meaning that the piston starts to extend or retract 2 game ticks after it is activated. Pistons can only activate on the input/consumer redstone tick ([[C-tick]]).

{{IN|je}}, the start delay can be 0 (activation in the same tick) or {{convert|1|game tick|second}} (activation in the next tick) depending on the [[Tick#Game process|game process]] in which the piston is powered:
* If the piston is powered and updated in the [[Tick#Scheduled tick|scheduled tick]] phase, [[random tick]] phase or block event phase, the piston activates in this game tick's block event phase, which means the start delay in this case is 0.
* If the piston is powered and updated during the [[entity]] phase or the [[block entity]] phase, or by player actions, the piston activates in the next game tick's block event phase, which means the start delay in this case is 1 tick. Notably, because blocks pushed by pistons arrive during the block entity phase (except when [[Sticky Piston#Block dropping|dropped]] by a sticky piston), in a chain of pistons each pushing a redstone block to activate the next, successive activations will happen 3 ticks apart.

=== Limitations ===
<!-- [[Push reaction]] redirects here. -->
Pistons can push most blocks, with the exception of the ones listed in the table below. 

Pistons cannot push blocks into the [[void]], above the [[build limit]], or beyond {{JE}}'s [[world border]]. They also cannot push more than 12 blocks. If the requirements for a block to be pushed are not met, the piston simply does not extend.

{{:Piston/Table}}

=== Powering pistons ===
[[File:Stacked pistons powered by one redstone line.png|alt=|thumb|Pistons powered by one line of redstone.]]

Pistons can be activated from any side, excluding from the head. {{IN|BE}}, redstone dust gets automatically redirected toward pistons if placed next to them (except for the head's side).

{{IN|JE}}, pistons can be powered from one block above compared to most redstone components: this property is called [[Tutorial:Quasi-connectivity|quasi-connectivity]] and can be used to make a [[Tutorial:Block update detector|BUD switch]], taking advantage of the fact that a piston powered through quasi-connectivity doesn't always get updated. With quasi-connectivity, a piston facing up can also be powered from the head's direction, which is otherwise impossible. Due to quasi-connectivity, a piston facing up that has a [[block of redstone]] on top of itself can extend but not retract: this happens because after the piston extends, it keeps receiving power from the redstone block.

=== Slime blocks and honey blocks===
{{Schematic
|caption=Piston A may extend because the slime block ignores the adjacent obsidian. Piston B may not extend because the diamond block is prevented from moving by the obsidian, as such the slime block also refuses to move.
|pi-e+A|SL|||pi-e+B|SL||-
||obsidian||||MB|obsidian
}}

When a [[slime block]] is pushed or pulled by a piston, adjacent blocks also move with the slime block, due to its stickiness. These blocks may in turn push other blocks, not just the blocks in the line in front of the piston. For example, a slime block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which in turn has to push additional ground blocks in the direction of motion just as if they were being pushed directly by a piston. The same occurs when a slime block is moved by another adjacent slime block. For example, a 2×2×2 cube of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled as a single unit by a piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube. A slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons or a block that can be broken by piston ignores that block. However, if an adjacent block could be moved, but is prevented to by the presence of an unmovable block, the slime block is prevented from moving as well and the piston does not extend.

Slime blocks' stickiness is unilateral, as such they can't be pulled by a non-[[sticky piston]] and they are not moved if an adjacent (non-slime) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2×2×3 structure of slime blocks may be pushed by a piston as long as no other movable block is adjacent to it. A piston cannot move itself via a "hook" constructed of slime blocks, but self-propelled contraptions can be created with multiple pistons. For more informations, see the article [[Tutorial:Flying machines]].

[[Honey block]]s work like slime blocks when it comes to moving other blocks, however honey blocks and slime blocks do not stick to each other. This allows, by alternating slime blocks and honey blocks, to have redstone contraptions which make use of these sticky blocks stay side by side without interfering with one another.

[[Glazed terracotta]] and the [[heavy core]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} have an interesting property: they ''do not'' stick to adjacent slime blocks or honey blocks, even though they can be pushed by pistons.

* When toggled between on and off rapidly with a gravity affected block (such as sand) above it, a piston can eventually break the block, which can be picked up as a resource. However, gravel broken this way never drops flint.
* Carpet can be placed on the piston extension block, and remains even if it is replaced with a solid block using {{cmd|setblock}}.
