A '''big dripleaf''' is a plant that generates within [[lush caves]]. Its leaf is a temporary platform; when stood on, it tilts down and drops its burden, resetting a few seconds later. The leaf can be [[powered]] to prevent it from tilting.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Big dripleaves can be obtained with any tool, but an [[axe]] is fastest. It also breaks when pushed with a [[piston]] or [[sticky piston]]. Breaking it at any spot on the plant causes the entire plant to collapse. 

Destroying a big dripleaf plant drops one big dripleaf for each stem block and the leaf.

=== Natural generation ===
Big dripleaves naturally generate within [[lush caves]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
[[Bone meal]] can be {{Control|used}} on a [[small dripleaf]] plant to turn it into a big dripleaf up to 5 blocks tall, as long as there is enough open space above it. Using bone meal on a big dripleaf plant makes it one block taller, creating an extra stem block (see [[#Growth]]).

=== Renewability ===
[[Wandering trader]]s sell [[small dripleaves]] for an [[emerald]]. Applying [[bone meal]] to small dripleaves turns them into big dripleaves, making them renewable.

== Usage ==
Big dripleaves consist of any number of non-solid stem blocks atop of each other and a single leaf as the uppermost block, which can be stood on by any entity like a normal block for {{convert|10|gt|s}}. After this time, it tilts down, becoming lower than a block and giving a player warning that it is about to collapse. After a 10 more game ticks, it tilts down and becomes temporarily non-solid. If the entity steps off the big dripleaf before it finishes starts tilting down, it still tilts down after the same amount of time. After {{convert|100|gt|s}}, the big dripleaf returns to its original position, and is again able to support any entity.

When the leaf is powered by redstone, it does not tilt or collapse. Powering the stem has no effect.

{{IN|be}}, the big dripleaf can only activate on the input/consume [[redstone tick]] (C-tick).

One-block tall big dripleaves can be used to make the player crawl. If a player is standing inside a big dripleaf when it is fully tilted, and the dripleaf returns to the untilted position, the player is left crawling underneath the leaf.

When directly hit with any projectile, the leaf immediately becomes temporarily non-solid. This cannot be prevented by powering it with redstone.

[[Frog]]s enjoy jumping on big dripleaves, although the dripleaf tilts down and drops the frog, unless the dripleaf is powered by redstone.

=== Placement ===
Big dripleaves can be placed only on top of [[clay]], [[coarse dirt]], [[dirt]], [[farmland]], [[grass block]]s, [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[mycelium]], [[podzol]], and [[rooted dirt]]. Big dripleaves can also be placed underwater. A big dripleaf is always one block tall when placed.

=== Growth ===
{{Control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on a big dripleaf makes it grow 1 block taller, unless there is a block above the leaf other than [[air]] or [[water]]. Unlike most plants, dripleaf does not grow by itself: bone meal must be applied for growth to occur.

=== Composting ===
Placing a big dripleaf into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
