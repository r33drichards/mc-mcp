The '''badlands plateau''' or '''mesa plateau''' was a variant of the [[badlands]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed {{in|je}}.

== Description ==
The badlands plateau featured large flat-topped hills composed of stratified colors of [[terracotta]] ranging in warm colors. Plateaus had steep edges that rose to within 20-30 blocks above sea level, where they quickly flatten. The top of these plateaus typically had scattered [[dead bush]]es. Occasional [[pond]]s appeared on plateau tops. The sides of the plateau occasionally revealed [[cave]]s and [[mineshaft]]s. [[River]]s that passed through badlands plateau biomes cut steep grooves, giving off the appearance of narrow canyons. These posed a fall damage hazard if the player was not careful. [[Canyon]]s would also generate here.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
