The '''Locked chest'''{{note|Capitalized in this way in-game, unlike other items or blocks}} or '''Steve Co. Supply Crate''' was a [[block]] intended to direct players to the [[Minecraft Store]], a site created as an [[April Fools' Day jokes#2011|April Fools' Day joke]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
When first introduced in [[Beta 1.4]], locked chests were indestructible except to explosions, which allowed it to drop.

From [[Beta 1.4_01]] up until its removal, locked chests could be broken instantly with any tool or by hand.

{{Breaking row|Locked chest|horizontal=1|foot=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
In Beta 1.4, if the date is April 1st of any year, the game picks a random location to generate a locked chest in every new chunk. If the chosen location is air and has a solid block below, a locked chest generates.

The server console outputs "added a chest!!" every time a locked chest generates.

== Usage ==
[[File:Locked Chest Message.gif|thumb|left|256px|The prompt that appears when the locked chest is used.]] 
The locked chest's initial purpose was to direct players to the [[Minecraft store]] at the URL [https://web.archive.org/web/20110401175108/https://www.minecraft.net/store/loot.jsp https://www.minecraft.net/store/loot.jsp]. Clicking the {{Control|use|text=use button}} would result in the dialog box to the left being displayed.

This functionality was exclusive to Beta 1.4; all later versions did not trigger this, and instead the block would disappear after a while, similar to [[leaves]].{{verify|is this the case for all versions pre removal?}}
{{-}}
=== Placement and orientation ===
Locked chests would decide their facing direction according to the blocks around them, generally making an attempt to face outward from walls. If their face was obstructed by a block, they would rotate accordingly to face away from said block.

Prior to Beta 1.8, said behavior was standard for directional blocks such as chests and furnaces. From Beta 1.8 onward, said blocks would instead face toward the player placing them, and would not change their facing direction depending on nearby blocks. The locked chest, being an unsupported block, was not subject to this change, and retained its old behavior up until its removal, making it unique in this aspect.

=== Fuel ===
Locked chests could be used as [[smelting|fuel]], lasting 1.5 items, the same as a regular [[chest]].

=== Note blocks ===
Locked chests can be placed under [[Note block|note blocks]] to produce the "bass" sound.

== Sounds ==
Locked chests did not have any unique sounds, such as an opening sound.

{{verify|did unique sounds for walking, punching, etc. exist at this point in development?}}

== Issues == 
Locked chest is a removed block and was an April Fools' joke, and as such issues relating to it cannot be fixed.

== Trivia ==
* Steve Co. Supply Crate is a reference to the ''[https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate Mann Co. Supply Crate]'' from [https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Team_Fortress_2 Team Fortress 2], where a [https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate_Key key] must be purchased for $2.49 in the in-game shop called ''Mann Co. Store'' in order to open the crate.
* At the time of the locked chest being added into ''Minecraft'', it looked identical to a normal chest. However, after Beta 1.8, when the chest model was updated to be smaller than a full block, the locked chest, a deprecated block at that point, remained with the old model, and as such would appear larger than an ordinary chest.
* If a Beta 1.4 world with Locked chests is updated to Release 1.7.2 or later, all locked chests turn into [[white stained glass]].
