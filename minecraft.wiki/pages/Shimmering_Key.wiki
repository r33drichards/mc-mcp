A '''shimmering key''' is an item added in [[25w14craftmine]] in Java Edition.

== Obtaining ==
Beating a special [[Mine (dimension) (April Fools' joke)|mine]] spawns a random shimmering key from the [[mine crafter]] block. 

Beating a normal [[Mine (dimension) (April Fools' joke)|mine]] has a 1 in 10 chance to spawn a shimmering key, this gives the player the possibility to obtain keys more than every 5th mine. 

Alternatively, a player can obtain a specific Shimmering Key with {{Cmd|/give @p minecraft:shimmering_key[minecraft:instant_room{{=}}{"structure": <structure>}]}}, where <code><structure></code> is one of the structure presets created for this snapshot.

== Usage ==
Shimmering keys can be used on a [[shimmering door]], which opens a menu. If the given key is valid and there is space behind the door to spawn the room it is trying to create, it then spawns a new room based on the key provided.

The keys tooltip shows the player which room type is created upon unlocking a shimmering door.

== Structures ==
When a new shimmering key is spawned from the [[mine crafter]] block, it comes with one of these structure presets in its <code>minecraft:instant_door</code> component:

== Trivia ==
* In the creative inventory, the Shimmering Key is in the Functional Blocks tab, despite being an item.
* Manually spawning a new Shimmering Key item with a valid <code>minecraft:instant_room</code> component allows the player to create a new room from a [[shimmering door]], as long as there's enough space to place the room. The room created is entirely dependent on the value of the component; without it, the key does not work.
