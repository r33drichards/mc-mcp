[[File:Swamp water fog.png|thumb|The dense, brown [[water]] fog in a [[swamp]].]]
'''Fog''' is a rendering feature intended for obscuring the player's view distance, usually for atmospheric effect or for seamlessly occluding sharp boundaries such as unloaded [[chunk]]s. While traditionally referring to [[render distance]], there are many other types of fog that can be encountered in-game under specific circumstances.

== Fog types ==

=== Render distance fog ===
[[File:Air fog.png|thumb|Default air fog is what causes the brighter sky color at zenith, and slight fading at the edge of the render distance.]]
This refers to fog that is dependent of the [[render distance]], which includes '''air fog''' in the Overworld and the End {{In|be}}, or general fog in all dimensions {{In|je}}.

The sight distance in the render distance fog is equal to the render distance, and the shape is a cylinder, which begins to appear at 92% of the render distance. Its color depends mainly on the [[biome]] the camera is in, and is affected by:
* the current day-time, and the [[Effect (dimension)|effect]] the dimension uses
** For the Overworld effect, the brightness of the color changes with day time.
** For the Nether effect, the brightness of the color is ''not'' affected by day time.
** For the End effect, the brightness of the color does not change with day time, but is 15% of the biome fog color.
* the current [[sky]] color<!--affected by lightning-->, and the render distance
** The smaller the render distance, the closer the color of the fog is adjusted to the sky color.
** When the render distance is 32, the color of the fog is not affected by the sky color.
* the direction the player is facing during a sunrise or sunset if the render distance is not less than 4
* the current [[weather]]
The base fog color is {{Color|#c0d8ff}} {{In|je}} and {{Color|#abd2ff}} {{In|be}}. In the [[End]], the fog color is {{Color|#a080a0}} in ''Java Edition'' and {{Color|#0b080c}} in ''Bedrock Edition''. In [[pale gardens]], the fog color is {{Color|#817770}}. 
[[File:Weather fog.png|thumb|Weather fog is colored gray and obstructs a larger part of the view distance.]]
In ''Bedrock Edition'', a separate type of render distance fog is used during [[precipitation]], known as '''weather fog'''. This fog is much denser; it appears at 23% of the render distance and becomes opaque at 70% of the render distance. The base color changes to {{Color|#666666}}, or {{Color|#403C44}} in pale gardens.

=== Environmental fog ===
{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}[[File:Environmental Fog.png|thumb|Environmental fog shown through the zoom of a [[spyglass]].]]
This refers to fog that renders ambiently inside chunks in the [[Overworld]]{{verify|is it dimension based, or does it depend on the [[dimension effect]]?}} that are far away from the player. This type of fog grows in strength at greater distances from the player and does not change with render distance.

==== Rain fog ====
Environmental fog grows in strength during [[precipitation]]. Rain-based fog becomes weaker when the player is not exposed to as much [[sky light]] (sky light is always the same regardless of the weather or [[daylight cycle]]). This creates the effect of the fog getting weaker when the player is not in the rain.

=== Special fog ===
This refers to fog used in special cases, which does not change with render distance.

==== Water fog ====
[[File:Transition fog mid.png|thumb|Water fog in a [[river]], after 5 seconds.]]
When the camera is in [[water]], a dedicated fog in the shape of a cylinder is applied to simulate this. Underwater fog progressively recedes with time spent underwater. The color and distance{{Only|be|short=1}} depends on the [[biome]] the camera is in (see {{Slink|Water|Color}} for a full list). {{IN|je}}, [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s have a thicker fog than most other biomes, which is controlled by the biome [[tag]] <code>has_closer_water_fog</code>.

When the camera descends into water, a much thicker initial fog is applied first, with the same color but obscuring the distance at 0.01 blocks, which is blended for 25% with regular fog at the start. The transition fog slowly disappears, being blended for 60% at 5 seconds and removed at 30 seconds.

==== Lava fog ====
[[File:Lava fog.png|thumb|Lava fog is so dense that it even fades held items on the [[HUD]].]]
When the camera is in [[lava]], an even thicker fog in the shape of a sphere is applied. Its color is {{Color|#991A00}}. With this fog, normally the player can see only 1 block away. The [[Fire Resistance]] effect can mitigate the fog so that the sight distance becomes 3 blocks. In [[Spectator]] mode, the fog is even less opaque to reveal objects located within up to half the render distance.

==== Powder snow fog ====
Being beneath [[powder snow]] imparts another fog in the shape of a sphere. Its color is {{Color|#9FBBC8}}. With this fog, normally the player can see only 2 blocks away. In [[Spectator]] mode, the fog becomes thinner so that things within half of the render distance are visible.

==== Nether fog ====
{{IN|be}}, sky and weather fog in [[Nether]] biomes has a specified range of blocks and does not change with the render distance, like other types of sky and weather fog. In the shape of a sphere, it begins to appear at 10 blocks and becomes opaque at 96 blocks. The color depends on the [[biome]], which is {{Color|#330808}} in [[Nether Wastes|Nether wastes]], {{Color|#1a051a}} in [[Warped Forest|warped forests]], {{Color|#330303}} in [[Crimson Forest|crimson forests]], {{Color|#1b4745}} in [[Soul Sand Valleys|soul sand valleys]], and {{Color|#685f70}} in [[Basalt Deltas|basalt deltas]].

=== Volumetric fog ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Vibrant Visuals volumetric fog comparison.png|thumb|A comparison of volumetric fog off vs on in a [[Pale Garden|pale garden]].]]
[[File:Vibrant Visuals underwater lighting.png|thumb|Volumetric fog applied underwater.]]
With [[Vibrant Visuals]] and [[ray tracing]], an additional type of fog is applied on top of regular fog settings. Volumetric fog has strong effect on how [[light]] behaves, which can be faded out, make the fog glow, or scatter into light shafts. The fog types used for volumetric fog are the same as all other fogs (sky, weather, water, lava, lava resistance). At Y=320 and higher, volumetric fog is not rendered.

All types of fog can scatter or absorb different colors light while it travels through air, [[clouds]], or water objects, which can provide additional colors for these objects.

With Vibrant Visuals, fog in water and air can affect how light shafts behave with the [https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Henyey-greenstein_phase_function Henyey-Greenstein G phase function].

The density, scattering, absorption, and Henyey-Greenstein G values for air fog are different for some biomes. Additionaly, color grading makes all types of fog appear in different colors for each biome.

== Fog modifiers ==

=== Height ===
If the world is not a [[superflat]] world, and the camera is not in lava and not in powder snow, the brightness becomes <code>power(clamp((y-minY)*0.03125,0.0,1.0))</code> of the original, which means that the color changes to pure black gradually from <code>minY+32</code> to <code>minY</code>.

=== Blindness and Darkness ===
[[Blindness]] and [[Darkness]] set the fog color to pure black in the shape of a sphere. The sight distance with Blindness is 5 blocks, while the sight distance with Darkness is 15 blocks. Both Blindness- and Darkness-caused fog fade out when the effect ends, while Darkness fog also fades in.

Blindness has a higher priority than Darkness. The two effects do not work if the camera is in lava or powder snow.

=== Wither ===
If there is a [[wither]] boss event, the color becomes darker and slightly redder.

=== Night Vision ===
If the camera is not in water, and the entity has no [[Darkness]] effect, [[Night Vision]] makes the color brighter.

=== Nether and ender dragon ===
If the entity has no Blindness or Darkness, in a dimension with the Nether [[Effect (dimension)|effect]],{{Only|je|short=1}} or a dimension where there's an ender dragon boss event, the sight distance in the render distance fog (not water, lava, powder snow fog) is half of the rendering distance, and the maximum sight distance is 96 blocks. The shape becomes a sphere.

== Objects unaffected by fog ==
Most things in the world are affected by fog. There are exceptions, most to all of which are presumably unintended:
* The [[world border]]<ref>{{bug|MC-223566}}</ref>
** Render distance fog is not used for the world border. It uses its own draw distance algorithm, which introduces inconsistencies.<ref>{{bug|MC-279571}}</ref> It being unaffected by fog is mainly visible via water, lava, powder fog, blindness and darkness fog.
* Chunk border lines<ref>{{bug|MC-220523}}, {{bug|MC-221254}}</ref>
** The [[core shader]] used for rendering these differs only from the normal shader used for translucent blocks in that it ignores fog. It is unknown if this was done intentionally, or is an oversight.
* [[Charged creeper]] armor<ref>{{bug|MC-279051}}</ref>
* [[Wither]] anti-projectile armor<ref>{{bug|MC-279052}}</ref>

In addition, the beams emitted by [[beacon]]s and [[end gateway]]s use an outdated spherical fog boundary, rather than the modern cylinder shape.<ref>{{bug|MC-279049}}, {{bug|MC-279050}}</ref> The intended behavior may be for beacon beams to be unaffected by fog, at least of certain types and in some directions.<ref>{{bug|MC-231123}}</ref>

== Custom fogs ==
{{For|the fog settings in resource packs|Fog definition}}{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|be}}, the currently active fog settings can be changed with the {{cmd|fog}} command, which has settings for every [[biome]]. These fog settings can be customized using [[resource packs]], or new fog settings can be added. When applying a fog setting to a biome, the identifier needs to be specified in the [[Resource pack#Biomes|client biome]] JSON files.

Active fog settings are determined from three aspects:
* Custom fog stack (from {{cmd|fog}} command)
* Fog settings for the current biome
* Default fog setting

Whenever the game needs to get the current fog, it checks the fog settings from these three aspects from the top (the newest fog setting in the fog stack from the command) to the bottom (default fog setting) in order, until it finds a fog definition for the current fog type.

In other words, this is equivalent to that all fog settings from the three aspects are applied one by one from the bottom (default fog setting) to the top (the newest fog setting in the fog stack from the command) in order. The fogs in a fog setting applied later overrides that of earlier fog settings. Each fog type works independently.

== Void fog ==
{{Outdated|section=1|edition=java}}

[[File:Void fog.png|400px|right]]

In prior versions of ''Java Edition'' (specifically [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release|Beta 1.8 Pre-release]] through [[14w34b]] inclusive, up to its removal in [[14w34c]]), a thick black fog was introduced. As the player descended below Y=26, this fog would start to appear. As the player traveled deeper, the fog at the edge of the render distance would become closer until the player reached the first layers of [[bedrock]], where visibility was reduced to just a few blocks, beyond which was complete darkness similar to the [[Blindness]] effect. The gray void particles started appearing below Y=7, as well as in the void.

The existence of this fog depended on a lack of sky lighting. If vent holes were opened up to allow skylight to enter an otherwise secluded underground space, void fog would no longer be present, so long as the player kept near this skylight source.

Void fog was removed late into 1.8's development for performance reasons and general community distaste.<ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|501766046681153536|Removed void fog today. Now we don't need to tick air blocks (seriously, WTH?), and honestly, who actually *liked* the void fog?|August 19, 2014}}</ref>

|{{HistoryLine||v0.10.0|dev=build 1|Render distance fog now covers <math>100[x-(x/3.2+30)]/x</math>% of the render distance, with <math>x</math> being the player's render distance in blocks.
|Render distance fog now becomes fully opaque at 20% of the distance between the player and the render distance limit.
|The 72 block minimum start distance for render distance fog has been removed.
|Water fog now becomes fully opaque 8 blocks away from the camera.
|Lava fog now becomes fully opaque 1 block away from the camera.
|[[Sky]] coloring is now visible through water and lava fog if the "Beautiful skies" toggle is enabled.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=build 2|All fog is now spherical and no longer changes based on the camera angle when [[fancy graphics]] is on.
|Render distance fog now covers <math>100[x-(x/2+32)]/x</math>% of the render distance, with <math>x</math> being the player's render distance in blocks.
|Render distance fog once again becomes fully opaque at the render distance limit.}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.12.1|dev=build 1|Added weather fog.}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.14.2|Render distance fog now covers <math>100[x-(x/2+12)]/x</math>% of the render distance, with <math>x</math> being the player's render distance in blocks.
|Render distance fog now becomes fully opaque 16 blocks under the render distance limit.}}
