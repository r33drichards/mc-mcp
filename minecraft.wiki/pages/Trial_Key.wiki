A '''trial key''' is an [[item]] obtained from [[trial spawners]] and some other containers in [[trial chambers]]. It is used to unlock a standard [[vault]] and obtain its loot.

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|trial-key}}

== Usage ==
{{control|Using}} a trial key on a standard [[vault]] (or [[ominous vault]] placed by [[commands]]) unlocks it, causing it to eject items and the trial key to be consumed. Vaults can only be unlocked once per [[player]], unless more than 128 players open it, which causes the first player on the list to be forgotten after all subsequent players open it.
