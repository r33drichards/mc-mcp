A '''companion''' is a player character that is controlled within ''[[Minecraft Blast]]''.

A player must choose a companion within the companion selection screen before playing the game. Six options are available. Unlike in {{MC}}, no custom companions can be brought into the game without using third party game mods. 

A companion interacts with in-game objects, mobs, and non-player characters (NPCs). The NPCs interact with the player's companion. The companion interacts with the player as well through the use of text bubbles.

In contrast to the companion, the player interacts with things outside the game, such as game menus like the companion selector, options, HUD elements, and developer interactions.
