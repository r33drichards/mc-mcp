=== Casting ===
On April 2, 2025, [[Jack Black]] and [[Jason Momoa]] were asked many questions in a Q&A for the film. Black was asked if he would be playing [[Herobrine]] in a sequel. His response was "Dude, you want to know if there’s Hero Brian in the sequel? We don’t know. We don't know... I hope so."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc4.com/dailydish/see-it-or-skip-it/exclusive-jack-black-jason-momoa-answer-questions-from-utah-kids-ahead-of-a-minecraft-movie/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Jack Black & Jason Momoa answer questions from Utah kids ahead of ‘A Minecraft Movie’|website=abc4.com|date=April 2, 2025}}</ref>

On April 4, 2025, [[Emma Myers]] and [[Sebastian Hansen]] told Yahoo UK how likely they thought a sequel would be. Emma said that she would love to do as many as they want, saying "Oh yeah, please. Minecraft 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 — as many as they'll have me in I would love to do!" Sebastian revealed that it would be  be "great [to] keep it going" but also is unsure how it could go about because of the way in which the movie tells a story entirely new to the world of the game so that means a potential sequel could go anywhere and do anything, which is an overwhelming concept.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/movies/will-be-minecraft-movie-2-cast-sequel-interview-095306480.html|title=Will there be A Minecraft Movie 2?
