'''Carpets''' are thin variants of [[wool]] that can be dyed in any of the 16 [[Dye|colors]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Carpets can be mined using any tool, or without a tool. Unlike wool, carpets are not destroyed quicker when using [[shears]].<ref>{{bug|MC-192893||Carpets have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Carpet|sprite=Carpets}}

=== Natural generation ===
;Igloo
White and light gray carpet can be found in [[igloo]]s. If its basement generates (50% chance), red carpet can also be found.
;Mansion
All carpet colors except orange and light blue{{only|bedrock|short=y}} generate within [[woodland mansion]]s.

;Village
Yellow, white, and green carpets generate in [[plains]] [[village]]s.

Lime, white, and green carpets generate in [[desert]] villages.

Blue and red carpets generate in [[snowy tundra]] villages.

Orange, white, and red carpets generate in [[savanna]] villages.

Purple, white, and red carpets generate in [[taiga]] villages.

;Ancient city
Gray, blue, light blue, and cyan carpets generate in [[ancient cities]].

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources|Any color Carpet}}

== Usage ==
Carpet has the same visual thickness as a [[pressure plate]]. It has a hitbox of {{frac|1|16}} of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on. This thickness prevents [[mob spawning]].

Carpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks, except [[air]]. When placed on [[grass]] or [[fern]], they break and the carpet is placed on the block below. When placed on [[vines]], the topmost block of vines breaks and the carpet is placed on the block below, any vines blocks below the first one don't break. It can even be placed over [[water]] blocks, but to do so you must target an adjacent block with a visible hitbox.

Carpet can be pushed and pulled by [[piston]]s but pops off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downward. It can also break falling sand and gravel.

Carpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on a light-emitting block in the floor, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time.

Carpets can be placed on top of [[fence]]s and [[wall]]s to allow the player to jump on top of them while still preventing animals and mobs from crossing. This is because mobs do not try jump over fences and walls, even with a carpet above. 

{{IN|je}}, if a [[campfire]] is placed beneath a [[beehive]] to pacify [[bee]]s, the campfire can be placed below ground and a carpet placed over the campfire to protect bees from the fire. {{IN|be}}, a carpet over a campfire removes the campfire's pacifying effect on bees.

If a carpet is placed so that it lays on top of a [[hopper]], the hopper can still collect [[item (entity)|items]] through the carpet. This is because hoppers can collect items from [[Solid block#Height|less than a full block]] above in ''Java Edition'', or less than {{frac|3|4}} of a block above in Bedrock Edition.

Carpets can also be placed over other carpets. Because mob AIs treats carpets as if they are [[air]] blocks, they used to be unable to walk over two or more layers of carpets. Nowadays, a mob will spin erratically upon walking onto a double carpet, and seemingly cancel their pathfinding attempt after a short while. Once targeting a new block or entity, they will either step off and resume their pathfinding normally, or walk onto another double-carpet block and spin again.{{only|je}} Double-carpet barriers can thus be traversed one block at a time, by any mob, and no longer work. Similarly, [[endermen]] are unable to teleport onto double carpet layers.

Carpets, similar to [[wool]], dampen vibrations from [[sculk sensor]]s. Placing or breaking a carpet does not create a vibration, nor does walking on one or throwing an item on one. They do not however prevent vibrations from other blocks from travelling through them.

=== Decorating llamas ===
[[File:All Llama swag patterns.png|thumb|right|All llama carpet patterns.]]

[[Llamas]] can be equipped with [[carpet]]s in their carpet slot ({{SlotSprite|Carpet}}). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back.

==== Enchanting ====
Carpets cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, {{in|java}} Creative mode, just like any other item, it can be enchanted with any enchantment using an anvil. While most enchantments have no effect, [[Thorns]], [[Feather Falling]], [[Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Blast Protection]], [[Curse of Binding]], and [[Curse of Vanishing]] apply their effects to the llama as expected.

=== Fuel ===
Carpet can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.335 items per carpet item.{{only|java}}

=== Breaking tall grass and vines ===
When placed on the top half of blocks like [[tall grass]], [[large fern]], or [[vines]] they break and the carpet drops as an item.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*If the player sprints across a carpet, the particle effects are those of the blocks that are directly below it.
*Carpets do not prevent the formation of [[ice]].
*Carpets can safely be placed on top of [[farmland]], although it does not protect the farmland from jumping entities.
*Double-layered carpet stops mobs from path finding.
