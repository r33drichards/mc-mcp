<br />
Some asymmetric aspects of certain rooms (like the chest in the altar room) can generate mirrored when compared to the blueprints below: in a nutshell, this happens because the generation of stronghold is hard-coded as orientation dependent. Particularly, the blueprints are exact when the rooms generate towards south (+Z) or west (-X) direction (when the player enters the room, is facing south or west), and are mirrored in the other two cases.

Note that any of the [[Stone Bricks|stone bricks]] that are part of the external walls in the blueprints below can be [[Mossy Stone Bricks|mossy]] (30%), [[Cracked Stone Bricks|cracked]] (20%) or [[Infested Block|infested]] (5%); the inner walls or floors in the single room, instead, are always made of regular stone bricks or cobblestone. Furthermore, the external wall of every room can not generate at all, if the room is floating in caves, resulting in disconnected stronghold parts and floating doors, chests, libraries.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/34dsgl/comment/cqts2b8/ "No... I wanted the strongholds to be a little messed up. The only room that has a guaranteed shape is the portal room.], That's also (unfortunately) why the EoE tracks the portal instead of the entrance." - jeb_</ref>
