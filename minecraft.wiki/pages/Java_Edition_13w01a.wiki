'''13w01a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on January 3, 2013.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130106004940/http://www.mojang.com/2013/01/minecraft-snapshot-13w01a/</ref> It mainly added an assortment of new [[redstone components]]. This is the first snapshot released in 2013.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Block of Redstone JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Block of redstone]]'''
* Stores redstone dust similar to [[blocks of diamond]], etc.
* Emits constant redstone power.
* Works as a pushable redstone power source.

'''[[File:Daylight Detector.png|32px]] [[Daylight sensor]]s'''
* Output power while receiving sunlight.
* The level varies depending on the time (more sunlight = more redstone power), and it does not function at night.

'''[[File:Hopper (D) JE1.png|32px]] [[Hopper]]s'''
* Places and takes out items in hoppers, [[chest]]s, [[furnace]]s, [[minecarts with chests]], [[dispenser]]s, and [[brewing stand]]s.
* Allows for the automation of many processes.
* Still a work in progress (as indicated by the inventory icon [[File:Hopper (item) JE1.png|32px]]).

'''[[File:Nether Quartz Ore JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Nether quartz ore]]'''
* New ore exclusive to the Nether.
* Drops 1 [[Nether quartz]] item when mined.
* Generates around [[netherrack]].

'''[[File:Redstone Comparator (S) JE1.png|32px]] [[Redstone comparator]]'''
* Has 3 inputs and 1 output. Input from the back is considered signal A, and whichever side gives the stronger signal is considered signal B.
* Has 2 modes: comparison and subtraction.
* In comparison mode, if A≥B, the output is A, otherwise output stays off.
* In subtraction mode, if A≥B, the output is A-B, otherwise output stays off.
* Replacement for the "capacitor" idea.

'''[[File:Trapped Chest.gif|32px]] [[Trapped chest]]s'''
* Gives out a signal depending on the amount of players looking inside. 1 player = 1 strength signal, 2 players = 2, etc.
* Crafted with a [[chest]] and a [[tripwire hook]].
* Large trapped chests can be staggered with large chests to allow more compact storage.
* Texture is slightly different than a normal chest, with a red stain around the latch.

'''[[File:Light Weighted Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[File:Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Weighted pressure plate]]s'''
* Detects item stacks.
* [[Light Weighted Pressure Plate|Gold]] version reaches full strength at 60 items.
* [[Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate|Iron]] version reaches full strength at 600 items.
* Linear, so 10 strength signal means twice as many items as a 5 strength signal.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Nether Brick JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Nether brick]]'''
* Used for crafting [[Nether bricks]].
* Obtained by smelting [[netherrack]].

'''[[File:Nether Quartz JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Nether quartz]]'''
* Item dropped from [[Nether quartz ore]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Locked chest JE4.png|32px]] [[Locked chest]]s'''
* Texture for the block was changed from [[File:Locked chest JE3.png|32px]].

'''[[Piston]]s'''
* Are more stable from previous versions.
** Sticky pistons are less sticky.{{info needed}}

'''[[Redstone circuit]]s'''
* Are now more consistent.

=== Items ===
'''General'''
* Now shows the item name in-game.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Now show the weapon someone was killed with.{{info needed}}

'''Inventory management'''
* Double-click items to fill the stack up as much as possible.
* Drag item stacks around to divide them up over the dragged-over slots.
* Drag item stacks around with the right mouse button to place one of that stack in each dragged-over slot, if that slot is not occupied already.
* Shift double-click an item stack to move all other item stacks of that kind to that part of the inventory.
* Press {{key|Q}} while the mouse is over an item in the inventory or a container to drop it.

== Bugs ==
* [MC-5711] Redstone torches attached to the side of a block do not pop off if the block supporting them is destroyed.
* [MC-5721] Dragging to spread an item out in the Creative inventory, then clicking on the inventory tab, and placing the 0 stack item down, the game crashes.
* [MC-5728] Infinite loop caused by subtraction mode comparators causes the world to be unplayable.
* Mineral duplication: players can exponentially dupe minerals by putting then in a crafting table with a block of their material, then double clicking on a mineral in the crafting table, works on the same principle as the method below.
* Crafted item duplication: any stackable crafted item can be duplicated by setting up its recipe in a crafting table, then double clicking an existing version of this item in the inventory. Requires at least one of that item to be present in the inventory. 

== Fixes ==
