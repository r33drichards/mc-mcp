'''Ms. Minerva''' is a teacher at [[Woodsword Middle School]], and a supporting character in {{WSC|0|1}}. She spends much of the story introducing various subjects to the heroes, her students, but gradually gets involved in the overarching conflict.

== Appearance ==
Minerva is a light skinned woman of average height. Her hair appears to be blonde and curly, tied up into a fluffy ponytail. Her wardrobe consists of a flannel jacket, a T-shirt with a lightning bolt, ballerina shoes, a long skirt, and several small bracelets on her left wrist.

Using a pair of [[VR goggles]], she is able to take on the persona of the Librarian. This avatar resembles a [[villager]] version of herself, with similar hair and glasses, but a longer (if noticeably thinner) nose and the attire of a [[plains]] villager.

During her time on vacation in {{Wikipedia|Greece}}, she wore Greek cultural attire.{{More info}}
