A '''piglin''' is a [[neutral mob]] found in [[the Nether]]. It is hostile to [[player]]s unless they wear at least one piece of [[golden armor]]. It can be given [[gold ingot]]s to [[barter]] for various [[item]]s. It wields either a [[golden sword]], [[golden spear]], or [[crossbow]], and uses either melee, spear charge, or ranged attacks, respectively. 

'''Baby piglins''' do not grow up, are passive, and take gold without giving anything in return.

== Spawning ==
Piglins spawn in groups of 4 in [[nether wastes]] and 3-4 in [[crimson forest]] biomes at [[light level]]s of 11{{only|Java}} or 7{{only|Bedrock}} and below. They can spawn on most blocks other than [[nether wart block]]s and [[magma block]]s.

Piglins spawn within [[bastion remnant]]s upon generation.

Each piglin has a 20%{{only|Java}} or 5%{{only|Bedrock}} chance to spawn as a baby.

{{IN|Java}}, piglins do not naturally spawn in the Peaceful [[difficulty]] except during [[world generation]] as part of [[bastion]]s. However, they are passive.

Every adult piglin spawns with a weapon: either a golden sword (45% chance), a golden spear (5% chance) or a crossbow (50% chance). Adult piglins can also spawn with golden armor, with each armor slot independently having a 10% chance to be equipped. Therefore, each piglin has a 34.39% chance to spawn with at least 1 piece of armor, and a 0.01% chance to spawn with a full set. Baby piglins never spawn with weapons or armor.

A baby piglin can also be spawned by {{control|using}} a piglin [[spawn egg]] on an adult piglin.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Piglin Head|notes=charged_creeper}}
|notes =
charged_creeper = Only when killed by a [[charged creeper]].
}}

If a piglin is killed in one hit while admiring a [[gold ingot]], the ingot drops. However, if the piglin is hit and not killed, the piglin stops admiring the item. This causes the item to vanish from its hands and subsequently not drop when the piglin is killed.

=== Equipment ===
Adults have an 8.5% chance of dropping each naturally held or worn <!-- might be possible to remove "held or worn" --> piece of equipment when killed by a player or tamed wolf. The dropped item has a random [[durability]]. Each level of [[Looting]] used to kill the piglin increases the drop chance for each piece of equipment by 1%.

Babies always spawn without equipment.

==== Weapons ====
A piglin naturally spawns with one of these weapons:
* {{ItemLink|Golden Sword}} (45%, or {{frac|9|20}})
* {{ItemLink|Crossbow}} (50%, or {{frac|1|2}})
* {{ItemLink|Golden Spear}} (5%, or {{frac|1|20}})

==== Armor ====
Adults sometimes {{info needed|What is the probability of each?}} spawn with 1-4 normal or enchanted pieces of armor, which may be:
*{{ItemLink|Golden Helmet}}
*{{ItemLink|Golden Chestplate}}
*{{ItemLink|Golden Leggings}}
*{{ItemLink|Golden Boots}}

=== Picked up equipment ===
Piglins always drop picked-up equipment upon death.

Piglins can pick up any type of armor or weapon, as long as the new equipment is better than the current equipment. See {{slink||Picking up items}}.

<!-- this doesn't belong in -->
{{IN|java}}, a picked-up item always [[drops]] with the same durability as when picked up.

{{IN|bedrock}}, armor {{info needed|Do picked up weapons take durability damage too?}} picked up by piglins can lose durability and even break (if it takes enough damage).

=== Other picked up items ===
Piglins do not drop any gold ingots, raw porkchops, or cooked porkchops that they have picked up. However, any other items they have picked up are dropped.

=== Experience ===
Adults drop {{xp|5}}, which is not affected by armor, if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]]. Baby piglins drop {{xp|5}}{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-175867}}</ref> or {{xp|1}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-178466|||WAI}}</ref>.

== Behavior ==
Piglins snort enviously while watching players holding a gold-related item.

Like [[villager]]s, piglins can open and close [[Wooden Door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s, but cannot open [[fence gate]]s, [[trapdoor]]s, or [[iron door]]s. They also cannot climb [[ladder]]s.

Piglins cannot swim and can drown if submerged.<ref>{{bug|MC-172102|||WAI}}</ref> They are not naturally immune to [[fire]] or [[lava]].<ref>{{bug|MC-172087|||WAI}}</ref>

Idle piglins retreat from [[zombified piglin]]s, [[zoglin]]s, [[soul fire]], [[soul torch]]es, [[soul lantern]]s, and lit [[soul campfire]]s. Piglins ignore soul fire items when pursuing the player, but still run from zombified piglins and zoglins. Baby piglins additionally retreat from [[wither skeleton]]s and [[wither]]s.

Crossbow piglins do not reload their crossbows when spawned, unlike [[pillager]]s. They reload only when provoked.

Baby piglins are passive and play with baby [[hoglin]]s, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.

Baby piglins can be given gold, but they do not give anything in return and run away. Baby piglins can also pick up and wear armor as well as hold gold tools or weapons. However, they are unable to pick up [[leather]].

Unlike many other mobs, piglins cannot be spawned holding any items in their off-hand; instead, the item in question is placed into their inventory or, if applicable, their main hand or an armor slot.<ref name="MC-172600">{{bug|MC-172600|resolution=WAI}}</ref> As a consequence, they cannot fire special ammunition from their crossbows, such as [[firework rocket]]s or [[tipped arrow]]s, and they cannot use a [[totem of undying]] alongside a melee weapon. If spawned with a [[gold ingot]] in their off-hand, the piglin immediately drops a random [[bartering]] good without examining the ingot.

=== Aggravation ===
Adult piglins are neutral if the player is wearing at least one piece of golden [[armor]]. Piglins are provoked by any player who: 
*Is not wearing any piece of gold armor.
**Short range, light aggravation
*Attacks a piglin or [[piglin brute]], regardless of whether the player kills it in one hit or not. 
**Long range, heavy aggravation to the damaged piglin, medium aggravation to other piglins
*Opens or breaks a [[chest]], [[trapped chest]], [[copper chest]], [[ender chest]],<ref>{{Bug|MC-172239|||WAI}}</ref> [[shulker box]],<ref>{{Bug|MC-189485|||WAI}}</ref> [[barrel]], [[minecart with chest]], or [[boat with chest]].
**Opening is short range, medium aggravation
**Breaking is mid-range, medium aggravation
*Breaks a [[block of gold]], [[gold ore]], [[gilded blackstone]], [[nether gold ore]], [[block of raw gold]], or [[deepslate gold ore]]. 
**Mid-range, medium aggravation

==== Aggravation range ====
[[File:Line of sight for piglins.png|thumb|right|Illustration of short range aggravation of piglins. Note the spherical range and that piglins behind walls are not aggravated because their line of sight is blocked.]]
* Short range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold [[armor]], or opening a container, piglins from up to around 15 blocks centered around the player become aggravated by the player if there is a straight line of sight to the player.
*Mid range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player breaking a {{Tooltip|golden block|Block of Gold, Gold Ore, Gilded Blackstone, Nether Gold Ore, Block of Raw Gold, Deepslate Gold Ore}} or a container, piglins from up to 16 blocks from the player’s feet become aggravated. No line of sight is required.
*Long range: When a piglin has been aggravated by a player damaging a piglin or [[piglin brute]], piglins from up to 16 blocks from the damaged piglin (rather than the player) become aggravated. No line of sight is required.

==== Light aggravation ====
*Light aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player not wearing gold [[armor]].
*The piglin can de-aggravate when the player puts on gold [[armor]], distracts the piglin with gold, or the piglin loses a line of sight with the player.

==== Medium aggravation ==== 
*Medium aggravation occurs when a piglin has been aggravated by a player opening/breaking a container or breaking a {{Tooltip|golden block|Block of Gold, Gold Ore, Gilded Blackstone, Nether Gold Ore, Block Of Raw Gold, Deepslate Gold Ore}}, or when a piglin witnesses a [[piglin brute]] or another piglin getting damaged by a player.
*Piglins under medium aggravation can be distracted with gold.
*A piglin already under light aggravation does not re-aggravate to medium aggravation. This means that if a piglin knows a player broke a {{Tooltip|golden block|Block of Gold, Gold Ore, Gilded Blackstone, Nether Gold Ore, Block Of Raw Gold, Deepslate Gold Ore}} near them after already going after them due to them not wearing gold [[armor]], the player can de-aggravate that piglin by putting on gold armor or losing the line of sight even though the player broke the {{Tooltip|golden block|Block of Gold, Gold Ore, Gilded Blackstone, Nether Gold Ore, Block Of Raw Gold, Deepslate Gold Ore}}.

==== Heavy aggravation ====
*Heavy aggravation occurs if a piglin is damaged.
*The piglin cannot be distracted by gold and is unable to barter while under heavy aggravation.

==== Other ====
*A player who is under the influence of the [[Invisibility]] effect can open containers in front of piglins without aggravating them. The player, while invisible, can also break containers or gold blocks without aggravating them.
*{{IN|java}}, a player under the [[Invisibility]] effect who is not wearing any armor can attack piglins without causing the piglins to retaliate. This is not the case with any other hostile or neutral mob because mobs attacked by an invisible player still attack the player.<ref>{{bug|MC-235027||Invisible players cannot provoke piglins, piglin brutes and hoglins when hitting/shooting them}}</ref>

Opening or breaking a [[hopper]] does not provoke piglins.<ref>{{bug|MC-178973|resolution=WAI}}</ref> Piglins do not react to the opening or breaking of other containers. Breaking a [[bell]] does not provoke them either, even though piglins admire them as gold.<ref>{{bug|MC-179104|resolution=WAI}}</ref>

When provoked, piglins remain hostile for 30 seconds.

Unlike other neutral mobs, piglins don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

=== Attacking ===
When a piglin is attacking, it holds its dominant arm and sword in front of it, similarly to a [[vindicator]].

Adult piglins are hostile toward [[wither skeleton]]s and [[wither]]s. 

Adult piglins congregate within 16 blocks and attack in hordes.

When attacking with a [[crossbow]], piglins shoot arrows every 2 seconds. {{IN|java}}, they walk backward (stopping if at the edge of a drop) as soon as the target is close. {{IN|java}}, their crossbows can break if it runs out of durability,<ref>{{bug|MC-163960|||WAI}}</ref> making the piglins use their fists, while {{in|bedrock}} their crossbows never break.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-67489}}</ref> Unlike mobs armed with [[bow]]s, they do not strafe from left to right while shooting. Also, unlike [[pillager]]s, piglins cannot fire [[firework rocket]]s or special kinds of [[arrow]]s, since they cannot hold them in their off-hand if spawned so.<ref name="MC-172600"/> Piglins with [[sword]]s and other [[item]]s rush at the player.

If a group of piglins successfully defeats their target, they gather at the site of their target's demise and emit "celebration sounds". However, piglins do not have a chance of dancing unless their target was a hoglin.

[[Iron golem]]s attack both adult and baby piglins; however, piglins do not attack iron golems without provocation.

The detection range of piglins is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin [[head]].

Piglins also retaliate to being rammed by a [[goat]].{{only|je}}<ref>{{bug|MC-227625}}</ref>

==== Hunting ====
[[File:Piglin celebrate hunt Revision 2.gif|thumb|upright|Piglin celebrating dance.]]
Piglins sometimes attack hoglins, causing other piglins and piglin brutes{{only|Bedrock}} in that area to attack the targeted hoglin as well.

Adults do not immediately attack adult [[hoglin]]s on sight, but a piglin has a random chance to decide to hunt a hoglin (this decision rarely happens if the piglin recently hunted, but other piglins can still start a hunt).{{verify|Is this true?}} Once that piglin attacks the hoglin, all other piglins and piglin brutes{{only|Bedrock}} in that area become hostile to the hoglin. If outnumbered by hoglins, the piglins flee, making "retreat" sounds. After defeating a hoglin (or any other [[entity]]), piglins have a 10% chance to do a "victory dance" by bobbing their heads, bodies and sticking out their arms like a T-pose.

Each piglin that sees a hoglin has a 10% chance of starting a hunt.{{verify|Piglin chances to start a hunt?}} Therefore, the more piglins there are, the larger the chance of a hunt occurring, as there are more opportunities for a hunt to begin. 

After a hunt, any nearby piglins pick up the porkchops or cooked porkchops the hoglin dropped, but not the leather.

Piglins that spawned as part of a bastion remnant during world generation do not hunt.

Piglin brutes also join in hunts started by piglins, but do not start a hunt themselves.{{only|Bedrock}}

==== Being distracted ====
Piglins briefly stop attacking when given gold items. If the player offers a gold ingot, [[bartering]] then takes place as it normally would. They resume attacking once the barter is complete. If the player distracts them with a gold item and equips a piece of gold armor while the piglin is examining the item, then the piglin ceases hostility. They may also cease hostility if distracted enough times. If the player breaks any gold-related block or hurt/kill a piglin and then distracts the piglin up to 5 times with a piece of gold armor equipped, the piglin ceases hostility entirely.

=== Bartering ===
[[File:Piglin Bartering Nether.gif|thumb|A piglin bartering in a warped forest.]]
{{main|Bartering}}
Adult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items when a gold ingot is dropped near them or when the player uses it while looking at them. The piglin "examines" the ingot for six{{only|Java|short=1}} or eight{{only|Bedrock|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448}}</ref> seconds, then drops a random item from the [[Bartering#Items bartered|chart]]. However, baby piglins examine the ingot and then run away without dropping an item. Piglins can also pick up items dropped by a [[dispenser]] or [[dropper]]. {{IN|java}}, the pool for what piglins can barter may be modified in a [[data pack]].

Piglins can still barter while riding another mob.

=== Picking up items ===
{{main|Geared mobs#Picking up gear}}
Piglins can pick up any [[item]]s they come across, except for [[leather]], and prefer [[gold]]-related items, which they actively seek out.

Each piglin has eight hidden [[inventory]] slots in which it can stack [[item]]s. A piglin with a full inventory does not attempt to pick up gold-related items, except gold ingots.

==== Equipping ====
A piglin automatically equips any armor or weapon it can pick up, as long as the new equipment is better than its current equipment. When this happens, the previously held or worn item is dropped, giving players another way to easily recover their equipment. Piglins also prefer gold over other armors.

When a piglin picks up a gold-related piece of equipment, it has to inspect the item first before equipping it. Inspecting the item takes six seconds. However, non-gold equipment, if preferrable, is equipped instantly. Piglins do not pick up any items when the {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is set to {{code|false}}.

Only a piglin with a crossbow can pick up crossbows.

A piglin picks up [[raw porkchop]]s and [[cooked porkchop]]s from 1 block, unless it has already done so within the last 10 seconds. However, a piglin does not seek out porkchops or go out of its way to collect them.

==== Piglin loved items ====
Items with the {{cd|piglin_loved}} [[tag]] are the only items that piglins want and pick up. When a piglin picks up one of these items, the player who dropped it (if it was dropped by a player) is given the [[advancement]]/[[achievement]] "O(oo)h Shiny!", unless the item was a gold nugget. Piglins aren't interested in other items, and can't be distracted by other items, even if the items are related to gold in some way.

Items that piglins love:
{{columns-list|
* {{BlockLink|Bell}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Gold}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Raw Gold}}
* {{ItemLink|Clock}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Gold Ore}}
* {{ItemLink|Enchanted Golden Apple}}
* {{BlockLink|Gilded Blackstone}}
* {{ItemLink|Glistering Melon Slice}}
* {{ItemLink|Gold Ingot}} (piglins [[barter]] something else in return)
* {{ItemLink|Gold Nugget}}
* {{BlockLink|Gold Ore}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Apple}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Axe}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Boots}} (worn after being examined)
* {{ItemLink|Golden Carrot}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Chestplate}} (worn after being examined)
* {{ItemLink|Golden Helmet}} (worn after being examined)
* {{ItemLink|Golden Hoe}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Horse Armor}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Nautilus Armor}} 
* {{ItemLink|Golden Leggings}} (worn after being examined)
* {{ItemLink|Golden Pickaxe}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Spear}} 
* {{ItemLink|Golden Sword}} (equipped if piglin is using a non-gold weapon or crossbow, or does not already have one)
* {{BlockLink|Light Weighted Pressure Plate}}
* {{BlockLink|Nether Gold Ore}}
* {{ItemLink|Raw Gold}}
}}

Baby piglins attempt to pick up every item (except leather), regardless of whether they love it, and they admire gold ingots and do not barter any items.

Adult piglins can pick up [[gold nugget]]s, but won't inspect them for bartering.  When killed, a piglin drops all of its items, except for gold ingots, raw porkchops, and cooked porkchops.

==== Despawning ====
Piglins that spawned in a bastion remnant during world generation, and piglins that have picked up or equipped items, do not despawn naturally.

=== Zombification ===
[[File:Piglin being zombified.gif|thumb|right|A piglin turning into a zombified piglin.]]
When in the [[Overworld]] or [[the End]], piglins transform into [[zombified piglin]]s after 15 seconds, retaining their armor, their name, and any items that they are holding. However, they cannot shoot a crossbow, using it instead as a melee weapon. Upon transformation, the spawned zombified piglin has the [[Nausea]] effect for 10 seconds{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>This does not happen in Bedrock Edition due to {{bug|MCPE-70866}}.</ref>; this is just a cosmetic effect. When a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops anything except equipped weapons and armor in its inventory; other items in its inventory disappear. In Bedrock Edition, if the game is set to [[Peaceful]] difficulty, the piglin despawns instead of transforming because hostile mobs do not exist in Peaceful difficulty. A piglin that returns to the Nether before 15 seconds remains unchanged, although the 15-second portal cooldown usually prevents them from returning during that time.

A piglin does not zombify outside the Nether if its {{cd|IsImmuneToZombification}} tag is set to {{cd|true}}. Piglins with their {{cd|NoAI}} tag set to {{cd|true}} also do not zombify.

In ''Java Edition'', if a piglin is inspecting/admiring a gold ingot or a gold-related item and then gets zombified while inspecting, it drops the gold ingot or the gold-related item.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* In ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', baby piglins make angry noises when any piglin gets angry.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-94090}}</ref>
* Piglin sounds were made by blending sounds of a Swedish domestic pig known as a "Linderödssvin".<ref>{{tweet|slamp0000|1379325769877446656|They’re all a blend of recordings of a swedish domestic pig ”Linderödssvin” and a real snorty session in the recording booth. Brutes had a unique session but a different personality.|April 6, 2021}}</ref>
* Originally, it was planned for piglins to have different ear flopping animations to represent their mindset and different emotions (excitement, fear and anger), but it was cut due to it being "not really that important and it's not worth going last mile to finish it".<ref>{{ytl|2paqmBrRuD0|06 Space Vadå prototyp @ 6:36|Agila Sverige|June 21, 2022|t=396}}</ref>
* The page for the Nether Update mentions that piglins have mined all of the [[netherite]] out leaving only the [[Ancient Debris|ancient debris]] behind.<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/nether</ref>
* During development of piglins, Henrik Kniberg thought piglins flopping their ears was a fun way of conveying emotion and played around with piglins having different ear animations for different emotions which included when in idle, piglin ears would move slowly from side to side, when the piglin is excited, the ears would flop quickly from side to side but this was scrapped due to it not being important and not worth going the last mile for it.<ref>https://youtu.be/2paqmBrRuD0?t=398</ref>
