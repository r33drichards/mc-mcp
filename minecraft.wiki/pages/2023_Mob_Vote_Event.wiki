The '''2023 Mob Vote Event''' was an [[Event servers|event server]] that was hosted as part of [[Minecraft Live 2023|''Minecraft Live'' 2023]], where players could participate in the yearly [[mob vote]]. There were two islands on the mob vote server. Players could travel the two islands by taking the boat found in the right side of the map. Each parkour had multiple checkpoints and level of difficulty. To complete the parkour the player had to ring the bell that was placed on top of the mob statues.
