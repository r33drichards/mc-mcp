A '''ravager jockey''' is the appearance of a [[ravager]] ridden by an [[illager]]. They are found in various waves during [[raid]]s.

== Spawning ==
=== Raids ===
{{Main|Raid#Raid wave composition}}

Like ravagers themselves, ravager jockeys spawn only during [[raid]]s in certain waves. Depending on the wave, they can have either a [[pillager]], [[vindicator]], or [[evoker]] rider.

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
A pillager-ravager jockey spawns in wave 5 and the extra wave (wave 6). 

A vindicator-ravager jockey and an evoker-ravager jockey spawn in wave 7.

Additionally, 0-1 pillager-ravager jockey and a vindicator-ravager jockey and an evoker-ravager jockey spawn in the extra wave (wave 8) in Hard [[difficulty]].

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
A pillager-ravager jockey spawns in wave 5.

A pillager-ravager jockey and an evoker-ravager jockey spawn in wave 7.

=== Summoning using commands ===
Ravager jockeys can also be manually spawned using [[command]]s. 

{{IN|Java}}, the [[illusioner]], an [[unused]] [[illager]], can also be spawned using commands. By extension, illusioner-ravager jockeys can be created.

Note: Ravager jockeys spawned this way cannot normally join raids. This can be configured using [[entity tag]]s.

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
Pillager-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon minecraft:ravager ~ ~ ~ {Passengers:[{id:pillager,equipment:{mainhand:{id:crossbow,count:1}<nowiki>}}</nowiki>]} }}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a pillager rider.

Vindicator-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon minecraft:ravager ~ ~ ~ {Passengers:[{id:vindicator,equipment:{mainhand:{id:iron_axe,count:1}<nowiki>}}</nowiki>]} }}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a vindicator rider.

Evoker-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon minecraft:ravager ~ ~ ~ {Passengers:[{id:evoker}]} }}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with an evoker rider.

Illusioner-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon minecraft:ravager ~ ~ ~ {Passengers:[{id:illusioner,equipment:{mainhand:{id:bow,count:1}<nowiki>}}</nowiki>]} }}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with an illusioner rider.

However, in ''Java Edition'', almost any mob can ride a ravager with commands, see [[Tutorial:Summoning jockeys]] for more information.

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
Pillager-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_with_pillager_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a pillager rider.

Raid Captain Pillager-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_with_pillager_captain_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a [[raid captain]] pillager rider.

Raider Pillager-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_for_raid_with_pillager_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a pillager rider, but the pillager drops raid-specific [[loot]] upon death.

Vindicator-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_with_vindicator_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a vindicator rider.

Raid Captain Vindicator-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_with_vindicator_captain_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a [[raid captain]] vindicator rider. 

Raider Vindicator-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_for_raid_with_vindicator_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with a vindicator rider, but the vindicator drops raid-specific [[loot]] upon death.

Evoker-Ravager Jockey:<br>
{{cmd|/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_for_raid_with_evoker_rider}}
* This command spawns a ravager jockey with an evoker rider.

== Behavior ==
{{main|Riding}}
{{Main|Ravager#Behavior|Pillager#Behavior|Vindicator#Behavior|Evoker#Behavior|Illusioner#Behavior}}

Ravager jockeys combine the behavior and power of the ravager and their rider. Often times, their movement is controlled by the rider. They attack [[player]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, [[snow golem]]s{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, and [[iron golem]]s. Because of their illager rider, they also flee from [[creaking]]s.

Like regular ravagers, the ravager has a chance to become stunned for a few seconds when their bite is blocked with a [[shield]]. However, their rider can still attack while the ravager is stunned.

Unlike most other jockeys, ravager jockeys can freely swim in [[water]] without immediately dismounting their rider. If a ravager jockey is fully submerged underwater it dismounts its rider, separating the jockey. The rider does not attempt to mount the ravager again after being dismounted.

The specific behavior of a ravager jockey depends on the rider. 

=== Pillager-ravager jockey ===
When attacking, the jockey moves into range and stops in place as the pillager loads and fires its [[crossbow]]. They stay a small distance away from their target, but the ravager can still bite if it gets close enough.

If the pillager is spawned without a crossbow or if it breaks, it becomes [[passive]].{{only|Java}} However, the ravager remains hostile, chasing and attacking targets.

=== Vindicator-ravager jockey ===
When attacking, the jockey rushes towards their target. The ravager and vindicator both attack normally.

If the vindicator is named "[[Easter eggs#"Johnny"|Johnny]]" it may attack the ravager, but the ravager never attacks it back.{{Only|Java}}

=== Evoker-ravager jockey ===
When attacking, the jockey rushes towards their target. The ravager bites while the evoker casts it spells, and the jockey slightly slows down as the evoker prepares to cast one.

The evoker may sometimes accidentally damage the ravager with its [[evoker fang]]s, but the ravager never attacks it back.

Summoned [[vex]]es damaged by the ravager’s roar do not attack it back.

=== Illusioner-ravager jockey ===
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}

When attacking, the jockey rushes towards their target until they get into range. It then starts strafing left-to-right, keeping distance as the illusioner shoots [[arrow]]s and casts its spells. The ravager can still bite if their target gets close enough.

When the illusioner creates its clones, they appear floating in the air and also sitting.
