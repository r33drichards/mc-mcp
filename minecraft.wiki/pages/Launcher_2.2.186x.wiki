== Changes ==
* Added transitions between all pages in the Launcher. To prevent motion sickness, one can enable (and disable) transitions under settings. Transitions come disabled by default.
* The filter for historical versions has moved in under settings.
* Patch notes content is now locally cached.

== Trivia ==
* In the changes section, it contained the text "¿dn ǝpᴉs-ʇɥƃᴉɹ uʍoɥs uǝɥʇ sᴉɥʇ sᴉ 'uʍop ǝpᴉsdn oʇ ǝƃɐnƃuɐl ǝƃuɐɥɔ noʎ ɟI" as an Easter Egg, which says "If you change language to upside down, is this then shown right-side up?".

== Fixes ==
* Login toast message now respects account migration dates.
* {{Bug|MCL-16797}} - Sculk sensor changes in 21w05a patch notes are not properly formatted.
* {{Bug|MCL-15385}} - Immediate crash on run Debian.
