'''Bedrock Editor v0.3.5''', is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on April 26, 2023, which fixes bugs.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/15239921044109</ref><ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/110</ref>

== Fixes ==
* Fixed a bug where the default command permission level of the client differed from what was displayed in a multiplayer session. Client permissions are now reflected properly in the UI
* Tool mode movement will now use the vanilla keyboard controls instead of hardcoded {{key|W|A|S|D|Space|Shift}} keys. Movement bindings can now be customized from the settings menu, but some keys might not be available if they are being used by other editor actions.
