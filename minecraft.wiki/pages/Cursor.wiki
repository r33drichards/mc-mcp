The '''cursor''' is a joke [[block]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]] with an animated texture that changes its color every second, toggling between lime and black [[concrete]].

== Obtaining ==
Cursors are available in the creative inventory, and naturally generate in the "terminal" dimension.

=== Breaking ===
Cursor requires a [[pickaxe]] to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
The block naturally generates in "terminal" dimension as the blinking "_" next to a "[[wikipedia:Drive_letter_assignment|C:\]]" made of lime [[concrete]]. It appears to be cycling between black and lime concrete in appearance, which is what the rest of the "terminal" dimension is made of.
