A standard set of ''Minecraft Labyrinth'' includes:<ref name=MCLabyrinthGameRules>[https://www.ravensburger.co.uk/gameinstructions/ecm/Spielanleitungen/242169_24684_X_web.pdf ''Minecraft Labyrinth'' game rules]</ref>

* One game board
* Thirty-four maze tiles
* Twenty-four picture cards, consisting of various items and mobs.
* Four playing pieces, consisting of Steve, Alex, Efe, and Sunny.
* Four pickaxes: two iron and two stone (both variants are used the same way for the "pickaxe rule" ([[#Pickaxe rule|see below]]))

== Setup ==

First, carefully remove the maze tiles, playing pieces, and picture cards from their respective punchboards. Then, shuffle the maze tiles and place them face up on the empty spaces on the game board to form a random maze of paths. One tile should be left over, which is used to move the maze.

Next, shuffle the twenty-four picture cards and distribute them evenly among all players. The picture cards are placed face-down in a pile in front of the player without looking at them. Then, the players choose a playing piece and place it on the starting space matching its color in one of the four corners on the game board.

If the "pickaxe rule" is used, each player also takes one pickaxe, placing it in front of them with the colored side face-up.

== Rules ==

The object of the game is to shift the maze tiles to clear a path to the items that the player is seeking and return to their own starting point.

=== Official rules ===

The player who most recently played ''Minecraft'' is the starting player. Otherwise, the youngest player is the starting player.

During a turn, the player must perform two consecutive actions, one after the other. Once the actions have been performed, play proceeds to the left of the starting player. Moving a player piece to the opposite end after it has been pushed off the game board does not count as an action.

Each player looks at the top picture card in their pile without showing it to the other players, indicating the first item for them to find.

=== Actions ===

==== Moving the maze ====

Twelve arrows around the edge of the board indicate wherever the player can insert the spare maze tile. On their turn, the player inserts the spare maze tile so that the tile at the opposite end is pushed out. The player cannot reinsert the push-out maze tile in the place that it was shifted from in the previous turn.

Any player pieces that are pushed off the board are immediately placed on the newly inserted maze tile on the opposite end of the board.

The spare maze tile must always be inserted, even if the player can reach the item they need without shifting any tiles.

==== Moving the playing piece ====

Once the maze has been moved, the player can move their playing piece as far as they can across a continuous path in the maze. The player may also pass through and end on spaces that contain other playing pieces. Alternatively, the player may choose not to move at all. If the player ends their move on an item they are looking for, then their respective picture card is placed face-up next to their pile, allowing them to look at the next card in their pile to find the next item.

==== Pickaxe rule ====

Once per game, the player can decide to use a pickaxe before moving their playing piece. When it is used, the player may pass through a wall as if it isn't there.

==== End of the turn ====

At the end of the player's turn, play proceeds to the player's left, repeating the actions as shown above.

=== End of the game ===

If a player collects all of the items on their picture cards and heads back to their starting space, the game ends immediately and that player is the winner.
