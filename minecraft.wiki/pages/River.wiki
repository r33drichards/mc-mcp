A '''river''' is a common aquatic [[biome]] that cuts through most land biomes. Rivers can serve as borders between various other biomes, and usually lead to [[ocean]]s, although they are also able to form loops.

== Description ==
Rivers are thin, lengthy biomes that frequently generate across the [[Overworld]], making up about 6.2% of the Overworld's area. They typically serve as a division between two different biomes, but can also split a single biome in two. They are filled with [[water]] up to sea level, though rivers may run dry in certain areas due to unusually high elevation. Saddle valleys in [[mountains]] can generate rivers, but often too high so that there's not any water. Rivers can vary a lot in width and depth, in generally flat areas rivers are usually around 10 blocks deep but in mountainous regions rivers can reach over 30 blocks in depth which is comparable to deep oceans. Sometimes rivers can also generate as lakes with small islands. Rivers often make giant loops as well, due to a quirk in the terrain generator.

[[Salmon]] and [[squid]] may spawn here. Along the riverbanks, occasional [[bush]]es and [[firefly bush]]es can be found, and [[sugar cane]] grows adjacent to water. Exposed grass takes on a bluish-green hue, similar to the meadow and birch forest biomes, and oak trees can rarely generate where there is available space. Riverbeds consist of [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], and [[clay]], and are one of the few places where clay generates, alongside lakes, [[swamp]] marshes, ocean hilltops, and [[lush caves]]. Atop the riverbed, [[seagrass]] commonly grows.

No fully-passive [[mob]]s spawn within river biomes themselves, but they frequently wander into them from the surrounding biomes if they can spawn there. Drowned can spawn underwater, as can [[salmon]] and [[squid]].

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:

== Issues ==
{{issue list|River}}

== Trivia ==
* Rivers override [[canyon]]s at or close to the surface level, causing the canyon to be abruptly cut off by a wall of stone. However, if the canyon is long enough, it may continue on the other side of the river.
** Canyons can generate underground in river biomes without being cut off.<!-- tested with river biome scale set to 9999999 -->
