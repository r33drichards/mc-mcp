* Has three variants: pearlescent (purple), verdant (green), and ochre (yellow).
** Which variant is dropped depends on the frog variant that eats the magma cube.
*** A pearlescent froglight is dropped if a warm (white) frog eats the magma cube.

'''[[File:Mud.png|32px]] [[Mud]]'''
* Found in mangrove swamp biomes.
* Can be created by using a [[water bottle]], directly or through a [[dispenser]], on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]] and [[rooted dirt]].
* Can be converted into [[clay]] by placing mud above a block with [[pointed dripstone]] underneath. The dripstone dries it out, producing a clay block.<ref>For the clay farming tutorial page, click [[Tutorials/Clay farming|here]].</ref>

}}

'''[[File:Reinforced Deepslate.png|32px]] [[Reinforced deepslate]]'''
* A new block only found in [[ancient cities]] shaped like a large frame.
* Unobtainable in Survival mode.
** Not craftable.
** Can be broken, but won't drop anything, even with [[Silk Touch]].
* Completely blast-resistant, immune to [[wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s. Takes an incredibly long amount of time to mine (82.5 seconds, which is almost 9 times longer than [[obsidian]] with a [[diamond pickaxe]]).
* Cannot be moved with pistons.

'''[[File:Sculk BE1.gif|32px]] {{Text anchor|[[Sculk]]}}'''
* Generates in the [[deep dark]] biome.
* Has an animated texture.
* Drops only [[experience]] when broken without [[Silk Touch]].
* Activates nearby sculk sensors and shriekers even when wool is placed on it.
* Sculk blocks grow when a [[mob]] dies near a [[sculk catalyst]].

'''[[File:Sculk Catalyst.png|32px]] [[Sculk catalyst]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome.
* Emits soul [[particles]] after a mob dies within 8 blocks, and grows sculk-related blocks.
** Spreads sculk blocks to wherever a nearby mob dies. The amount it spreads depends on the amount of experience the mob is meant to drop.
*** Even if the mob doesn't drop experience as it wasn't killed by a [[player]], the blocks would still spread based on the amount of experience it normally drops.
*** Experience does not drop in these cases.
** The charge decays over time, faster the farther away from the catalyst it moves.
*** If a charge decays more than 4 blocks away from the catalyst, it has a chance of creating either a [[sculk sensor]] (90%) or a [[sculk shrieker]] (10%).
*** If a charge decays more than 24 blocks away from the catalyst, it merely vanishes.
* Drops only [[experience]] when broken without [[Silk Touch]].
* Emits a light level of 6.
* [[File:Sculk Catalyst Bloom.gif|32px]] Blooms when activated.

* Can "shriek", emitting ring-like/sonic particles.
** Is activated by a [[sculk sensor]], [[redstone]] signal or player's stepping.
*** [[Sculk shrieker]]s summon [[warden]]s only if there isn't one within 48 blocks.
** Gives players the [[Darkness]] effect when activated.
** If activated three times, a warden is summoned from the ground.
*** Player has 4 levels of {{cd|warning_level}} (0-3), everytime activated, the levels increased by 1, and never decrease.
*** If a player had successfully summoned a warden, only one attempt is required to summon a warden next time.
* Drops only [[experience]] when broken without [[Silk Touch]].
* Has a {{cd|can_summon}} blockstate, which determines whether it can summon a [[warden]] and give the player [[darkness]] or not.
** Set to {{cd|true}} by default for sculk shriekers placed via worldgen.
** Set to {{cd|false}} by default for sculk shriekers placed by a player or generated via sculk spread.

'''[[File:Sculk Vein BE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk vein]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome on the edge of sculk patches.
* Generates in a layer on top of blocks, similar to [[snow]].
* Can be placed in all directions, like [[glow lichen]].
* Has an animated texture.
* Drops nothing when broken without [[Silk Touch]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Allay.png|40px]] {{Text anchor|[[Allay]]}}'''
* Voted to be in the update during [[Minecraft Live 2021]].
* Can find dropped blocks or items for a player, collecting the same items from the world as it holds in its hand.
** Picks up dropped items in loaded chunks and can carry up to a stack at a time,<ref>https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q81usv/comment/hgmfpl6</ref> and cannot duplicate items<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1447945258743091200|Allays are not item duplicators, they pick up items nearby on the floor that are the same item it has been given. So you could give it a dirt block, then it will find dirt blocks that are dropped, collect them, then return and drop them to you or a note block you've set up.|October 12, 2021}}</ref> or take items out of [[chest]]s.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1447945260366286853|They cannot get items from chests either. Only dropped items. You could feasibly use this for item sorting if you make a cool contraption :D|October 12, 2021}}</ref> It drops its collected items when in range of a [[note block]].
<!-- Do not add any information regarding the jukebox. As of now, it is confirmed that only the allay can drop items in range of a note block. Nowhere has it been stated by a Minecraft developer that the allay can also drop items in range of a jukebox. Adding the mention of a jukebox without a proper source stating such will be immediately reverted. -->
* If it holds an item it got from a player, it follows that player, up to a distance of 64 blocks away.
** It can be made to hold an item by interacting with the allay (pressing {{control|use}}).
** The item can also be removed by interacting with the allay (pressing {{control|use}}) while with an empty hand.
* Able to drop items at nearby [[note block]]s, and stay close to a note block that has been played near them.
* When a note block is played near them, that note block becomes their favorite one for 30 seconds, and they attempt to drop off items at that note block rather than at the player.
** Connecting with [[note block]]s is visualized by the vibration particle.
** Connecting with note blocks can be blocked by [[wool]], by placing wool between the allay and the note block.
* If they have items in their inventory, they attempt to give them to their owner.
* Sometimes spawn in cages next to [[pillager outpost]]s (similar to [[iron golem]]s), and inside [[woodland mansion]] jail cells.
* There is a 3 second delay for picking up new items after delivering items.
* Immune to damage from its owner while holding an item.
* Have {{hp|20}} health points and a natural health regeneration of {{hp|2}} per second.

'''{{animate|Temperate Frog JE1 BE1.gif;Cold Frog JE1 BE1.gif;Warm Frog JE1 BE1.gif|32px}} {{Text anchor|[[Frog]]}}'''
* Comes in three variants: temperate, warm, and cold.
** The temperate variant is orange, the warm variant is white, and the cold variant is green.
* Can croak, jump, swim, and slowly walk on land.
** Can jump over 5 blocks.
** Frogs are faster in water than on land.
** Prefer to jump to [[lily pad]] and [[big dripleaf]].
* Are able to target specific mobs as food, using a base attack strength of 10.
** Eats small [[slime]]s, dropping [[slimeball]]s.
** Eats small [[magma cube]]s, dropping [[froglight]]s.
* Can be tempted and bred using slimeballs.
** Lay [[Frogspawn|eggs]] on water after mating.
* Grow from [[tadpole]]s.
** Variants depend on the [[Biome#Temperature_2|temperature]] of the biome it turns from a tadpole to a frog in.
* Have {{hp|10}} health points.

'''[[File:Tadpole.png|40px]] {{Text anchor|[[Tadpole]]}}'''
* Grows up into a frog 20 minutes after birth, which can be sped up using slimeballs.
** Frog type depends on which temperature it grows in.
* Can be held in a [[water bucket]].
* Jump around like fish when on land, and eventually die.
** Panics on land and pathfinds to a nearby water source.
* Are hunted down by [[axolotl]]s.
** Also panics if there are axolotls nearby.
* Have {{hp|6}} health points.

'''[[File:Warden JE1 BE1.png|51x51px]] [[Warden]]'''
* The first fully blind mob ([[bat]]s have basic eyesight, both in-game and in the real world).
** Because of this, it stumbles as it walks.
** Has a sense of smell. It can detect and pathfind toward the general location of a player or mob through a "smelling" action.
*** Prioritizes smelling the player or mob that it is most suspicious of, rather than the one closest to it.
** Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it pathfinds toward the source of the movement.
*** It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.<ref group="note">The Warden does not attack non-mob entities but it does follow the vibrations that they make.</ref>
**** It does not attack other wardens.
*** When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to the [[sculk sensor]].
**** Seems to follow the same rules as the [[sculk sensor]] when detecting vibrations.
**** If any projectile (e.g. [[egg]], [[snowball]], [[arrow]]) lands near it, the warden inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating significant vibrations. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
*** Does not detect players that are [[sneaking]].
** Can detect players or mobs that have the [[Invisibility]] effect.
* Becomes more suspicious of a player or mob as it detects its location more through vibrations and/or smelling. When it suspects the target enough, it identifies its exact location, which aggravates it, causing it to pathfind toward the target to attack regardless of outside distractions.
* Spawns in the deep dark biome, specifically when a player activates sculk shriekers three times.
** It is the only mob that spawns in the deep dark biome.
* "Emerges" from the ground when spawned by [[sculk shrieker]]s.
** Digs back into the ground when it doesn't sense any vibration after 60 seconds.
*** Like how [[name tag]]s prevent despawning, name tags can also prevent wardens from being able to burrow back to the ground.
*** Wardens do not dig back when they're in water.
* A mob designed to be extremely difficult, intended to be avoided and fled from.
** Has {{hp|500}} health points (more than a wither, except {{in|BE}} on Hard mode, where wither has {{hp|600}} health) and does {{hp|30}} damage on Normal difficulty, bringing players wearing full [[Armor|netherite armor]] from full health to {{hp|7}} health points. Wardens also disable [[shield]]s when they hit the players with their fists, and are at least as fast as a walking player.
* Is immune to fire damage, knockback, and liquid slowdown.
* Drops a single [[sculk catalyst]] on death, as well as a negligible amount of experience, making slaying it not worthwhile at all.
** The warden doesn't qualify as a target for the [[advancement]] "Monster Hunter" and isn't needed to receive the advancement "Monsters Hunted" due to its role.
* Warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the [[Darkness]] effect.
** The core creates a low throbbing or "heartbeat" sound as it pulses. The sound and animation speed up rapidly as the warden gets more suspicious of or closer to attacking a player or mob.
* Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding the [[iron golem]] and [[enderman]] in height and width (the same).
* Can charge a ranged attack when the player is building high, hiding behind walls or being out of range of their melee attack.
** Their rib cages open up to shriek a sonically charged ranged attack that can penetrate walls and bypasses shields and armor (including the damage reduction by armor enchantments such as [[Protection]]).
** The ranged attack deals {{Hp|10}} damage in Normal and can hit at a horizontal distance of 15 blocks.
** The ranged attack can hit only one target at a time.

=== Non-mob entities ===
[[File:BoatsWithChests MinecraftLive2021.png|thumb|right|An image of two variants of the Boat with Chest shown during Minecraft Live 2021]]
'''{{animate|Oak Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Spruce Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Birch Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Jungle Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Acacia Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Dark Oak Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Mangrove Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png;Oak Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png;Spruce Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png;Birch Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png;Jungle Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png;Acacia Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png; Dark Oak Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png;Mangrove Boat with Chest (item) JE2.png|32px}} [[Boat with chest]]'''
* Similar to a [[minecart with chest]], but with a [[boat]] instead of a [[minecart]], so the player can take a journey on the water and carry things.
* Can hold only one entity.
* Crafted by combining a [[chest]] with any [[boat]].
* Comes in different wood plank variants, including the [[dark oak]], [[Jungle tree|jungle]], and the newly added [[mangrove]] wood plank variant.
* Opening its inventory or breaking it makes nearby adult [[piglin]]s angry.
* Breaking it drops itself and all its items.

'''{{Animate|Earth (texture) JE1 BE2.png; Wind (texture) JE1 BE2.png; Water (texture) JE1 BE2.png; Fire (texture) JE1 BE2.png|32px}} [[Painting]]'''
* Added unused paintings {{cd|d=and|earth|wind|fire|water}} from {{el|be}}.
** These paintings are not placeable by default, but can be added through [[commands]] (such as {{cmd|/summon painting ~ ~ ~ {variant:"water"} }}) or through a [[datapack]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Ancient City SE.png|32px]] [[Ancient city]]'''
* New structure that generates within the deep dark biome and includes all of the deep dark features within it.
* Extremely large in terms of size, always generated at Y=-52.
* Made of [[deepslate]] and its variants, [[basalt]] and its variants, and [[gray wool]].
* Contains [[soul sand]], [[soul fire]] and [[soul lantern]]s, as well as [[candle]]s and [[skeleton skull]]s.
* Contains mysterious frames made of [[reinforced deepslate]].
* Contains chests with unique loot, like [[echo shard]]s, [[disc fragment]]s, and the [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment.
** Other valuable loot includes the "[[otherside]]" music disc, potions of [[Regeneration]] II, [[enchanted book]]s, enchanted iron and diamond [[leggings]], enchanted diamond [[hoe]]s, and [[enchanted golden apple]]s.
** If the frame of [[reinforced deepslate]] generates with a chest in front, it always contains one [[golden apple]] (a hint about how to open the secret door below).
** Has different levels and open spaces, with several types of ruins and wall structures.
** Some of these structures contain dark oak [[log]]s, [[planks]], and [[fence]]s; cyan, light blue, and blue [[wool]] and [[carpet]]s; [[ladder]]s; [[ice]] and its variants; [[note block]]s; [[stone pressure plate]]s; and [[iron trapdoor]]s opened with [[lever]]s.
* Hidden underneath the frame of [[reinforced deepslate]] are several rooms containing [[redstone]] mechanisms that serve to introduce new players to their function.
** Each variant of the city center has a different redstone puzzle concealing the entrance, requiring slightly different strategies to solve.
** The mechanisms are made with [[redstone dust]], [[redstone torch]]es, [[redstone repeater]]s, [[redstone comparator]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, [[blocks of redstone]], [[sticky piston]]s, a [[sculk sensor]], a [[target]], and a [[lectern]].
** One variant includes a [[lever]], and another includes a [[furnace]] containing 24 [[deepslate]] and a [[wooden shovel]].

'''{{BiomeLink|Deep Dark}}'''
* New [[biome]] at the "deepest depths of the world".
* Tends to generate under continental/mountainous areas, exclusively within the [[deepslate]] layer between Y=-1 and Y=-64.
** Can extend above the deepslate layer, sometimes up to around Y=33.<ref>{{bug|MC-249213|||WAI}}</ref>
* Ancient cities can generate here.
* Wardens can spawn here through the activation of sculk shriekers.
* The surface contains patches of sculk-related blocks.
* Except from [[monster spawner]]s, no mobs other than wardens can spawn there, similar to [[mushroom field]]s.

'''{{BiomeLink|Mangrove Swamp}}'''
* A new swamp [[biome]] with teal water that often generates in warmer clusters, usually next to [[jungle]]s and [[desert]]s.
* Contains mangrove trees, a new type of tree, and are the only trees that can generate there (unlike the regular swamp, that can also generate [[oak tree]]s).
* Naturally spawns warm [[frog]]s and [[slime]]s, but there are no [[sheep]], [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s or [[chicken]]s.
* Does not generate [[witch hut]]s.
* The floor is coated with a layer of [[mud]] which goes all the way from the surface down to stone.
* [[Tropical fish]] can spawn in water.
* Water fog color is pale green instead of yellow like in the normal swamp.

'''{{Text anchor|Mangrove Trees}}'''
* New type of [[tree]] variant that is found in [[mangrove swamp]] biomes.

=== General ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Chat messages between players, as well as chat from the {{cmd|say}}, {{cmd|msg}}, {{cmd|teammsg}}, and {{cmd|me}} commands, are now cryptographically signed.
* Players are given a Mojang provided key-pair on startup.
* Chat styling is now handled via server resource packs with the translation key {{cd|chat.type.text}}.
* Servers can now define different chat-style formats for clients, which can now be controlled by the server through the {{cd|chat_type}} registry (found under the worldgen folder in the vanilla report).
** These are synchronized to clients when they join the server.
** The translation key or translation format can be defined, like {{cd|chat.type.text}} or {{cd|%s says: "%s"}}.
*** Chat can be similarly optionally narrated with a custom translation key or format.
** The entire message can have formatting applied, such as italics or a specific color (but currently not click or hover events).
* Servers can now enable chat preview, which displays a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box, showing how the message appears when sent.
** Can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring.
** Chat preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent.
*** The server then sends back the styled preview in real time.
*** This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed.
** Chat preview is also shown for chat-related commands, such as {{cmd|say}} and {{cmd|msg}}.
** A warning toast message is shown on the client when joining a server with chat preview, and it can be globally disabled in chat settings.
** Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is signed only when chat preview is enabled.
*** Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Secure Chat" in chat settings.

'''[[Chunk format]]'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|blending_data.min_section|blending_data.max_section}} that determines which sections are used for data for blending.

'''[[Data pack]] and [[resource pack]]'''
{{Resource pack format/value|9}}
*** This section has mandatory field {{cd|block}}, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths.
*** If any of files in packs added before one with {{cd|filter}} section matches any pattern inside {{cd|block}}, it is filtered out (i.e. treated as if not present in the first place).
*** {{cd|filter}} section does not apply to a pack containing it, only to packs loaded before it.
*** Both {{cd|namespace}} and {{cd|path}} can be omitted: if they are, the game works as if they had been specified as a ".*". Missing field matches every value. When they are included, these fields contain a regular expression pattern.
*** For example, adding pack with this section in {{samp|pack.mcmeta}} after vanilla pack hides all recipes and advancements defined by vanilla pack:
::::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
"filter": {
    "block": [
        {
            "namespace": "minecraft",
            "path": "recipes/.*"
        },
        {
            "namespace": "minecraft",
            "path": "advancements/.*"
        }
    ]
}
</syntaxhighlight>
* World presets/types and superflat world [[presets]] in "Create World" screen can now be controlled by datapacks.
** New registry types {{cd|d=and|worldgen/world_preset|worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset}} were added to data-driven presets (like "Amplified" or "Single Biome").

'''[[Debug screen]] and profiling'''
* Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and F3 debug screen.
** This is available only for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries.
* Added "Blending" row, above the "Noise Router" row.
* Added a heap memory allocation metric.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|HasLeftHorn|HasRightHorn}} boolean fields to goats' entity format.
** Decides the visibility and dropability of their horns.

'''[[Font]]s'''
* Added new glyph provider type {{cd|space}}, to allow creation of space-like glyphs.
** New provider has single argument called {{cd|advances}} which is map of codepoint to glyph advance (width).
** Rendering of space glyph is no longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in font).

'''[[Item modifier]]'''
* Added the item function {{cd|set_instrument}}, to sets item tags needed for instrument items to a random value selected from a tag, with following parameter:
** {{cd|options}}: a tag reference specifying the instrument options to randomly pick from.

'''[[Language]]'''
* Added Malay written in Arabic script (Jawi).<ref group=note>Also available for versions since [[Java Edition 22w11a|22w11a]].</ref>

'''[[Options]]'''
* A new accessibility slider has been added in the options menu called “Darkness Pulsing”.
** It controls how dark the Darkness effect gets when a warden or [[sculk shrieker]] gives it to the player.
* Added "Directional Audio" sound option, for 3D Directional Audio simulation.
** Uses HRTF-based directional audio to improve the simulation of 3D sound, making it easier to distinguish which direction a sound comes from (including if it is above or below the player).
** Requires HRTF compatible audio hardware.
** This option is best experienced with headphones.
** Toggled off by default.
* Added "Chat Preview" chat option, for enabling chat preview.
** Toggled on by default.
* Added "Only Show Secure Chat" chat option, for clients who prefers to always show the original, signed message.
** Toggled off by default.

'''{{samp|[[options.txt]]}}'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|chatPreview|onlyShowSecureChat}}.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Added new particles:

'''[[Player.dat format]]'''
* Added a new {{cd|LastDeathLocation}} field, which contains a {{cd|dimension}} string and a list of three integers representing the block position of the player's last death called {{cd|pos}}.

'''Protocol'''
* Servers now also send an additional icon and MOTD packet after a player has connected.
** This allows servers with {{cd|enable-status{{=}}false}} to set an icon and MOTD for players that successfully connect.
* Custom servers can now enable or disable chat preview for certain clients by sending a new network packet.

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Added server property {{cd|enforce-secure-profile}} to allow servers to requiring a player to having a Mojang-signed public key.
** Defaults to {{cd|false}}.
** Enforcing secure profiles prevent players without a Mojang-signed public key from connecting.
* Added server property {{cd|max-chained-neighbor-updates}} to limit the amount of consecutive neighbor updates before skipping additional ones. Negative values remove the limit.
* Added server property {{cd|previews-chat}} to enable chat preview.
** Defaults to {{cd|false}}.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added the following splash text:
** "Shriek like a Sculk Shrieker!"
** "Who let the frogs out?"
** "RIBBIT!"
** "Croak team!"
** "Nooooooooooooo!"
** "Flower forest TM perfume"

=== Non-mob entities ===
<!--; [[Item frame]]
* Now adjusts its hitbox to account for the larger size of a framed [[map]].-->

'''[[Minecart with chest]], [[minecart with furnace]], [[minecart with TNT]], and [[minecart with hopper]]'''
* Crafting [[recipe]]s are now shapeless.
* Now drop themselves when broken.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Custom world generation]]'''
* The dimension folder is no longer present in the vanilla world generation reference pack, but dimension files still work like they used to inside a custom data pack.
* There's a new file type that the data report generator can output in the {{cd|biome_parameters}} folder, containing all the biome parameters for the default vanilla dimensions.
* Custom dimensions no longer require a separate seed field, and in fact can no longer have a custom seed - the world seed is now always used for all dimensions.
* Dimension types now have two new fields for controlling monster spawns.
** {{cd|monster_spawn_block_light_limit}} is an integer controlling the block light needed to prevent monster spawns.
** {{cd|monster_spawn_light_level}} is an int provider which is evaluated to find a value to compare the current overall brightness with to determine if a monster should be allowed to spawn.

'''{{Text anchor|[[Swamp]]}}'''
* Temperate [[frog]]s can now spawn in swamps.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|bossbar}}'''
* Fixed rendering of boss bars, now they have the correct appearance even when several boss bars with the notched style are visible at once.

'''{{cmd|locate}} and {{cmd|locatebiome}}'''
* Merged into the new {{cmd|locate|link=none}} command:
** {{cmd|locate|link=none}} -> {{cmd|locate structure|link=none}}
** {{cmd|locatebiome|link=none}} -> {{cmd|locate biome|link=none}}
* {{cmd|locate biome|link=none}} now searches in 3D properly, which means it locates cave biomes correctly.
* {{cmd|locate biome|link=none}} now returns all three coordinates in the output.

'''{{cmd|placefeature}}'''

=== General ===
'''[[Bonus chest]]'''
* Now has a chance to contain [[mangrove log]]s.

'''[[Chunk format]]'''
* Removed {{cd|blending_data.old_noise}}, now existence of {{cd|blending_data}} in chunk data determines if a chunk is considered old.

'''[[Data pack]] and [[resource pack]]'''
{{Resource pack format/value|9}}
* Data pack format is now 10.
* The built-in vanilla pack, the report generated by the game, and the vanilla world generation reference pack now store their object keys sorted alphabetically (with the exception of type fields and parent fields, which get listed first).
** This makes diffing the files easier after changes, and avoids false positive changes from fields moving around.

'''[[Debug screen#More debug-keys|Debug keys]]'''
* Removed debug hotkey cycling render distance ({{key|F3+F}}).

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* The H for "humidity" has been changed for a V for "vegetation".

* {{cd|entity_interact}} should be dispatched more often when interacting with various mobs.

'''[[HUD]]'''
* Changed the texture of the "half" armor bar, moved the highlighted pixel from the right to the left.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* The special case size-dependent loot drops of [[slime]]s and [[magma cube]]s are now data driven and part of their loot tables, using the new sub-predicate types.

** "Floating Dream" and "Comforting Memories" can be played in all types of forests, jungles, and old growth taigas.

'''[[Options]]'''
* The description of the FOV effects setting now correctly mentions all gameplay effects rather than only speed effects.

'''[[Panorama]]'''
* Changed to reflect [[The Wild Update]], showing a mangrove swamp.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* The parameters to the {{cd|vibration}} particle have changed: instead of specifying the start position as an extra parameter, the regular source of the particle is now used.

'''Point of Interest types'''
* Removed {{cd|d=and|unemployed|nitwit}} {{cd|point_of_interest_type}}.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Renamed the {{cd|feature}} field in location predicates to {{cd|structure}}.
* {{cd|d=and|player|fishing_hook|lightning_bolt|catType}} fields have been replaced with {{cd|type_specific}}.
* {{cd|type_specific}} has field {{cd|type}} (one of {{cd|d=or|player|fishing_hook|lightning_bolt|cat}}) and same fields as removed fields.
* Example:
:* Before:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
 "lightning_bolt": {
   "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
 }
</syntaxhighlight>
:* After:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
  "type_specific": {
    "type": "lightning",
    "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
  }
</syntaxhighlight>
* {{cd|catType}} has been wrapped to match new format and now uses new cat variant names instead of texture names.

"catType": "minecraft:textures/entity/cat/british_shorthair.png"
</syntaxhighlight>
:* After:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
 "type_specific": {
    "type": "cat",
    "variant": "minecraft:british_shorthair"
 }
</syntaxhighlight>
* New {{cd|type_specific}} options:
** {{cd|frog}} has {{cd|variant}} field matching frog variant ({{cd|d=or|minecraft:warm|minecraft:temperate|minecraft:cold}}).
** {{cd|slime}} applies for slimes and magma cubes, has {{cd|size}} field matching slime size (smallest is 1).

'''Randomized events predictability'''
* Following randomized events are now more predictable, and no longer have a possibility of extreme behaviors:
** Placement and velocity of things dropped from [[dropper]]s or [[dispenser]]s.
** Placement and velocity of items spawned from containers upon destroy.
** Randomized {{cd|follow_range}} component attribute for mobs.
** Velocity of [[horse]]s spawned from skeleton traps.
