[[File:Action_bar_bed_too_far.png|thumb|The message "You may not rest now; the bed is too far away" is shown on the action bar.]]

The '''action bar''' is a space just above the player's [[hotbar]] where text can be displayed. Some gameplay elements, such as [[bed]]s, use this to give contextual hints to the player. Text can also be displayed here using the {{cmd|title}} command.

== Behavior ==
The action bar is displayed above where item names are shown when an item is selected in your hotbar, so an item name and action bar text can be shown on the screen at the same time.

When text is displayed here, it instantly appears and remains on the screen for approximately 1.5 seconds{{info needed}} before fading out. If another action bar message is sent, it instantly replaces the previous text without any transition/animation and remains there for the usual 1.5 seconds it normally would if it was not replacing anything.

{{IN|be}}, the opacity of the black background on the action bar can be adjusted in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].

== Gameplay uses ==
{{IN|be}}, certain messages are shown in the [[chat]] instead of the action bar.
