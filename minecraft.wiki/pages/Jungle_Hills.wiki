The '''jungle hills''' biome was a hills variant of the [[jungle]] biome that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
Similar to other hills biomes, the jungle hills featured steeper terrain, making it a more difficult variant of the already difficult jungle for survival purposes. The foliage generated was similar to its regular counterpart, with large or small [[Jungle tree|jungle trees]] (sometimes with [[cocoa pods]]), large or small [[oak trees]], [[melon]] patches, [[bamboo]], and [[Jungle Bush|jungle bushes]]. [[Ocelot|Ocelots]], [[Parrot|parrots]] and [[Panda|pandas]] also spawned here and [[jungle pyramid]]s generated here.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], jungle hills use a strong humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which fades the distance in an orange tint. Jungle hills have warm atmospherics, lighting, and color grading, which makes the biome look more humid and warm.

== Mobs ==
{{IN|Java}}, jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as jungles for ambient categories, and had different chances for the others, while {{in|Bedrock}}, jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as jungles.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
