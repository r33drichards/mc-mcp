'''Beta 1.21.60.27''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.60.27''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the fifth beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.60]], released on January 15, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/33502112973069-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-60-27|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.60.27|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=January 15, 2025}}</ref> which fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[Jungle bushes]]'''
*Now generate with [[oak leaves]] instead of [[jungle leaves]], to match {{edition|java}}.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-164963||Jungle bush generated differently with Java Edition.}}</ref>

=== Technical ===
'''Component'''
*Moved the {{cd|minecraft:compostable}} item component out of experimental and to {{cd|Release}}. Moved the related scripting apis out of {{cd|Beta}} to {{cd|Release}}.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "Creator Cameras: Focus Target Camera" experimental toggles.
=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[API]]'''
*Renamed {{cd|handleCounts}} interface to {{cd|HandleCounts}} in {{cd|@minecraft/debug_utilities}} module.

'''Experimental'''
*Focus Target Camera has {{cd|vertical_rotation_limits}} of {{cd|[0.0, 180.0]}} by default to reflect world space changes.
*Focus Target camera now stops targeting when either {{cd|clear}} from the camera command is used, or when the target is over 64 chunks away from the camera.

'''Stability and Performance'''
*Experimental support for applying a service-driven texture memory budget in low memory situations. When enabled, memory will be conserved by progressively reducing resolution of some textures as usage approaches the budgeted limit.
