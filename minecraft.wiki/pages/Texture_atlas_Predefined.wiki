{{For|atlases that have been removed from {{JE}}|Texture atlas/Predefined/Removed from Java Edition}}

Certain texture atlases are defined as image files themselves in resource packs, rather than being compiled at runtime. It appears that these are generally being phased out and split into constituent sprites.

== Lists of atlases ==

=== Current ===
The following texture atlas files are still in use as of [[Java Edition 1.21.11]]. It is not known if Mojang plans to split these into their constituent textures in the future, potentially replacing them with a procedurally-generated atlas.

[[Font]]s can also use a texture atlas system, however this is data-driven, unlike the following cases, which are hardcoded.

==== <samp>experience_orb.png</samp> ====
This file is used for each size of [[experience orb]]. The five last textures are unused. The changing coloration used for experience orbs is done via a hardcoded [[tint]] system, rather than proper animation as is done for most animated textures,<ref>{{bug|MC-276497}}</ref> and the translucency is also hardcoded instead of being controlled by the texture's alpha channel.<ref>{{bug|MC-276496}}</ref>
