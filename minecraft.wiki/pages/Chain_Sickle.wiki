A {{JP|'''Chain Sickle'''|鎖鎌|Kusarigama|lead=yes}} is a weapon consisting of a sickle on a metal chain. They can be created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
Chain Sickles are composed of a central chain, with a sickle on one end and a heavy weight on the other.

== Functionality ==
Chain Sickles can be used for close- and medium-range combat. As they can be swung to increase momentum and damage, they can be effective against other spinning techniques, like [[Yamabuki]]'s [[Obsidian Twin Blades#Techniques|''Kamaitachi'']].
