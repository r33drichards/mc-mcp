*Added hotkeys to take screenshots in game on controller and keyboard. On mouse/keyboard: {{Keys|F2}}. On controller: {{Xbtn|lb}} + {{Xbtn|rb}}, {{Psbtn|l1}} + {{Psbtn|r1}}, {{Nsbtn|l}} + {{Nsbtn|r}}.

=== Technical ===
'''AI Goals '''
*Removed the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.peek}} AI goal component that was never used.

'''API'''
*Changes to iterators to make them properly store their own state, be simplified and better handle common usages.
*The following APIs have been shipped out of experimental: {{cd|PlayerCursorInventoryComponent}} API, Target Selector for Actor Properties APIs, and the Block Record Player Component APIs.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Parsing {{cd|blocks.json}} now produces a Content Error if its {{cd|format_version}} is greater or equal than the block names it overrides.
*The {{cd|item_display_transforms}} field in block geometries no longer requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle.

'''[[Item]]s'''
*Item data versioned 1.16.100+ can now be overridden by item data versioned 1.16.100+ higher in the pack stack.
*Enables Creators to override 1.16.100+ data driven Vanilla items with 1.16.100+ data.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:storage_item}} item component to allow an item to store data of the dynamic container associated with it:
**This component requires that the bundles toggle is enabled.
**A dynamic container is a container for storing items that is linked to an item instead of a block or an entity.
**To use this component the item must have {{cd|minecraft:max_stack_size}} set to 1.
**The {{cd|max_slots}} field (1 to 64) defines the number of slots of the dynamic container.
**The {{cd|max_weight_limit}} field defines the maximum allowed sum of the weight of the items in all slots of the dynamic container.
***Items that stack to 64 weigh 1 each, those that stack to 16 weigh 4 each and unstackable items weigh 64.
**The {{cd|allow_nested_storage_items}} field allows for other items with a {{cd|minecraft:storage_item}} component to be put inside it.
**The {{cd|weight_in_storage_item}} (0 to 64) defines the additional weight the item adds when inside another storage item.
***A value of 0 means that this item is not allowed inside another storage item.
**The {{cd|banned_items}} field defines the items that are not allowed in the item's dynamic container.
**The {{cd|allowed_items}} field defines the items that are exclusively allowed in the item's dynamic container.
***If empty all items are allowed in the item's dynamic container.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:bundle_interaction}} item component to enable bundle-specific interaction scheme and tooltip.
**This component requires that the bundles toggle is enabled.
**To use this component the item must have a {{cd|minecraft:storage_item}} component defined.
**The {{cd|minecraft:bundle_interaction}} component interacts with the container created by the {{cd|minecraft:storage_item}} component.
**The {{cd|num_viewable_slots}} field (1 to 64) defines the maximum number of item stacks accessible from the top of the bundle, while other slots are hidden.
**Textures named {{cd|[item_name]_open_front}} and {{cd|[item_name]_open_back}} must be added to {{cd|textures/textures_list.json}}.

'''[[Trading|Trade Tables]]'''
*The Trade Table files are now versioned:
**TradeTier's {{cd|total_exp_required}} is a required member from version {{cd|1.21.30}}.
**TradeTier's {{cd|groups}} is a required member from version {{cd|1.21.30}}.
**TradeItem's quantity {{cd|min}} cannot be lower than {{cd|max}} from version {{cd|1.21.30}}.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" and "Bundles" experimental toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Items ====
'''[[File:Bundle Filled BE1.png|32px]] [[Bundle]]s'''
* Added bundles.
* A bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack.
* A bundle only fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types.
* Player can insert items into a bundle directly in the [[inventory]].
* Bundles have a tooltip that shows the items inside:
** If a bundle has less than 8 item types inside, the tooltip will show all of them.
** Otherwise, the tooltip will show the top two rows of items and the others will be hidden below.
* Player can select any of the visible items to pull out of the bundle:
** Use the scroll wheel on mouse, the right stick on a game controller, or tap on a touch device.
* When selecting an item to remove, the bundle icon shows that item poking out of the bundle.
* When holding a bundle in hand, player can empty it onto the ground.
* The bundle is crafted with one string above one leather:
{{Crafting
|B1=String
|B2=Leather
|Output=Bundle
|ignoreusage=1
}}

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[API]]'''
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerCursorInventoryComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.14.0}}.
