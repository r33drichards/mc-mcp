'''Suspicious sand''' is a fragile [[Falling Block|gravity-affected block]] found in various Overworld [[structure]]s. It can be [[brush]]ed to extract unique structure-dependent loot from it. It drops nothing if it breaks, and will break if it falls or is moved.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|java}}, suspicious sand drops as an [[item (entity)|item]] if it falls for more than 30 seconds, which can be achieved by falling into an upward [[bubble column]], or through two [[cobweb]]s stacked on top of each other.<ref>{{bug|MC-260073||Suspicious sand drops as an item after 30 seconds of existing as falling block|WF}}</ref> However, it does not retain its loot.<br>
{{IN|bedrock}}, suspicious sand can be obtained only through the [[Creative inventory]], using {{control|pick block}} in [[Creative]] mode and [[command]]s.

=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break suspicious sand is [[shovel]].
{{Breaking row|Suspicious Sand|Shovel|drop=0|horizontal=1}}
Suspicious sand drops nothing when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Suspicious sand generates naturally in buried rooms under [[desert pyramid]]s, as well as in the bottom of [[desert well]]s. It also generates within [[Ocean Ruins#Warm ocean ruins|warm ocean ruins]].

== Usage ==
=== Brushing ===
When a [[brush]] is {{ctrl|used}} on a suspicious sand, cracks start to appear on all sides of the block as the {{cd|dusted}} block state of the block starts to increase. If the suspicious sand being brushed is naturally generated, an item gradually emerges from the side where the player starts brushing. After 96 (6+20+30+40 per stage) [[game tick]]s (4.8 seconds), the item is extracted, and the suspicious sand is converted into [[sand]].

If the player stops brushing a suspicious sand, the block remains in its half-excavated state for a few seconds, before gradually returning to its unexcavated state one stage at a time.

=== Loot ===
The item obtained and the [[loot table]] of suspicious sand is dependent on which structure it has generated in. Items can be extracted only from naturally generated suspicious sand. When placed by the player, nothing is produced after brushing.

=== Turtle eggs ===
A [[turtle egg]] can hatch only if placed on suspicious sand, regular [[sand]], or [[red sand]].

=== Piston interactivity ===
Suspicious sand is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
