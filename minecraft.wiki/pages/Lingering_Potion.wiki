== Obtaining ==
=== Brewing ===
{{main|Brewing}}

{{brewing
  |Dragon's Breath
  |Matching Lingering Potion
  |base=Matching Splash Potion
  |ingredients=[[Dragon's Breath]] + <br>Matching [[Splash Potion]]
}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|lingering-potion-of-healing,lingering-potion-of-poison,lingering-potion-of-slowness,lingering-potion-of-weakness}}

=== Natural occurrence ===
{{main|Ominous Trial Spawner#Projectile spawning}}
During [[ominous trial]]s, each [[ominous trial spawner]] has an equal chance to randomly dispense one of these lingering potions on top of either a player or a mob it spawns:
* {{EffectLink|Wind Charged}}
* {{EffectLink|Oozing}}
* {{EffectLink|Weaving}}
* {{EffectLink|Infested}}
* {{EffectLink|Strength}}
* {{EffectLink|Speed}}
* {{EffectLink|Slow Falling}}
These lingering potions are directly dispensed into the world and cannot be obtained in the inventory.

== Usage ==
=== Creating area effect clouds ===
{{Infobox entity
| title = Area Effect Cloud
| image = Area Effect Cloud.png
| size = Height: 0.5 blocks<br>Width: Varies
| imagesize = 290px
}}

Lingering potions are thrown, like [[splash potion]]s, by {{control|using}} them. On impact they break, and after a second they create a lingering cloud with their effect. The cloud is made of the potion particles corresponding to the potion that was thrown. Unlike splash potions, lingering potions do not activate their effect immediately on impact.

The cloud starts with a radius of 3 blocks, decreasing to 0 over the course of 30 seconds. During the cloud's existence, any player or mob that walks into it after the first second gets the corresponding status effect; this decreases the radius by a {{frac|1|2}} block immediately, reducing the cloud's lifespan by 5 seconds.

For effects with duration, the duration applied by the cloud is {{frac|1|4}} that of the corresponding [[potion]]. For effects without duration such as healing or harming, the potency of the effect is {{frac|1|2}} that of the corresponding potion.

The effect may be applied consecutively if the player or mob remains in the cloud. For example, a player throwing the Lingering Potion of Healing II straight down consumes the cloud within a few seconds while being healed 5 times for a total of {{hp|20}} health. As far as healing is concerned, this makes the lingering potion much more powerful than the regular or splash potion, provided that the player is away from other mobs or players.

Lingering potions can also be thrown out of [[dispenser]]s like splash potions.

In ''[[Java Edition]]'', [[creeper]]s with potion effects will explode with their effect dropped as if a lingering potion was thrown.

=== Lingering water bottle ===
Like the [[Splash potion#Splash water bottles|splash water bottle]], a lingering water bottle puts out fire, damages [[endermen]], [[blaze]]s, [[strider]]s, and [[snow golem]]s by {{hp|1}}, and restores {{convert|1800|tick|second}} of air to [[axolotl]]s. {{IN|java}}, it creates no effect cloud, while {{in|bedrock}} it creates an effect cloud that extinguishes burning entities that walk into it. {{IN|bedrock}}, a lingering awkward, mundane, or thick potion acts similar to the lingering water bottle, being able to extinguish burning entities and damage endermen, blazes, and snow golems, but without the ability to put out fires.

==== Mud ====
Lingering water bottles can be {{control|used}} on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], or [[rooted dirt]] to turn it into [[mud]].<ref>{{bug|MC-249250}}</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Matching Lingering Potion}}

=== Filling cauldrons ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, using a lingering potion on a cauldron adds one level of that potion to the cauldron. Attempting to add a lingering potion to a cauldron with water, dyed water or a non-matching potion empties the cauldron and creates an explosion sound (but no actual explosion).

=== Uncraftable lingering potion ===
In [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']], the uncraftable lingering potion is a lingering potion with no effect that is unobtainable in [[Survival|survival mode]]. It is also available in potion and splash potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.

It can be obtained using the following command: <code>/[[Commands/give|give]] @s minecraft:lingering_potion</code>. It is also obtained when a lingering potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.

== Behavior ==
{{#lst:Splash Potion|thrownpotion}}

== Custom effects ==
{{Main|Data component format#potion contents}}
{{IN|java}}, lingering potions can be obtained with any status effect using {{cmd|give}} and the <code>potion_contents</code> data component.

== Sounds ==
{{edition|java}}:<br>
Lingering potions use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* A thrown lingering potion faces toward the [[player]] in first-person view while it appears rotated horizontally in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable [[item]]s ([[ender pearl]]s, [[egg]]s, [[snowball]]s, and all throwable potions).
* The [[Lingering Potion of the Turtle Master]] has the longest item name in the game.
** It's also composed of 6 words, more than any other item in the game other than items and books named through an anvil.
** "[[Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate]]" is the current longest name for a block tied with "[[Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks]]" (34 characters with spaces, 31 without) and "[[Copper Chest|Waxed Weathered Large Copper Chest]]" (34 characters with spaces, 30 without)
** The record holders in ''[[Minecraft Education]]'' are "[[Hardened Light Blue Stained Glass Pane]]" and "[[Hardened Light Gray Stained Glass Pane]]" (both at 38 with spaces, 33 without).
** Throughout Minecraft's history, the longest named block is the [[Quadruple Compressed Poisonous Potato Block]] in the [[Java Edition 24w14potato]] snapshot with a length of 43 characters with spaces and 39 without.
