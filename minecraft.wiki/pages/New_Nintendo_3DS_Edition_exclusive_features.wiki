* This is the only edition of the game wherein the [[splash]] text is not slanted and above the logo.

== Graphics ==
* [[Fire|Burning]] mobs emit large particles with fire's animation.
* Entity shadows move depending on the position of the [[sun]].
* At sunset, clouds turn pink.
* Water has smooth [[lighting]].
* Blocks emitting light, such as lit furnaces, powered redstone, glowstone and lava, have no shadows on their sides as other blocks do.
* The animations for the player burning, suffocating, entering a Nether portal and feeding animals are all changed from {{edition|je}}.
* Lava has a different animation when flowing.
* [[Zombie pigmen]] (including babies) only have an attack animation.

== World generation ==
'''[[World size]]'''
* Small, medium, and large. (672×672, 1344×1344, and 2016×2016).
** The max world size for this edition is larger than ''Wii U Edition''{{'}}s world size of 864×864, despite the 3DS being far less powerful than the Wii U.
** ''Pocket Edition'' has a smaller world size in megabytes than Legacy Console Edition, which allows it to have larger size worlds.
* The [[Overworld]] is centered at the world spawn point, not at 0,0; and the [[Nether]] is as well at its scaling of 1:3. The End dimension is centered at 0,0 with the same size as the Overworld.
** The [[End dimension]] has a barrier that generates at the same location as the edge of the Overworld for the particular world seed, despite it generating centered at 0,0 while the Overworld is centered at the world spawn point.
** The barrier can cut through the central End island or outer End islands, however, one can use ender pearls to cross the barrier.
* [[Biome]]s that would exceed the 128-block height limit are shrunk to fit in.
* Biome map seed parity with {{el|Pocket}} seeds between [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha|alpha 0.9.0]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.41|''Bedrock'' 1.17.41]], (32-bit seeds).
** Despite limited worlds, biome sizes match that of {{el|Pocket}}, meaning that even on large worlds, there are no more than about a dozen biomes per world, and most worlds do not have all biomes.
** Biome size and structure frequency is the same across all world sizes, so smaller worlds have less biomes and less structures.
* Outer End islands are shared in the same dimension/file as the central End island, more similar to ''Java''/''Bedrock'' than the Legacy Console splitting of outer end islands into separate areas. 
** The distance from the central End island to the outer End islands does not vary by world size.
* There are 4 [[End gateway]]s, regardless of world size. These generate x67 z67 blocks away in all four diagonal directions on the central End island, one End gateway for each corner outer End island.
* *A player must defeat the ender dragon before loading an outer End island for the corresponding End gateway to generate and function properly.
* At least one [[End city]] generates in most cases, but End ships are not guaranteed. In some cases, the height limit can cut off an End city.

'''[[Superflat]] world type'''
* Known as '''Flat'''
* ''Classic'' preset only; cannot be customized.
* Has no villages.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Blacksmith chests can have [[ink sac]]s and [[emerald]]s.
* Tables have carpets instead of pressure plates.
* Can generate in [[cold taiga]] and [[ice plains]] biomes, using Spruce Wood like the Taiga villages.
* Zombie village buildings are built with [[moss stone]] and [[cobweb]].
* Acacia logs don't replace cobblestone in Savanna villages.

'''[[Tree]]s'''
* A tree has a chance to have [[vines]] growing around the trunk, making a "dying tree".
** This includes trees grown from [[sapling]]s.
* Fallen trees are present.
** They are composed of a trunk lying on its side, sometimes with vines and [[mushroom]]s, and a stump one to two blocks away in the direction the rings are facing.

* Has a 1% chance of spawning as a [[spider jockey]].
** If in the Nether, they have a 1% chance of spawning as a [[wither jockey]], (This makes it more dangerous, because if the player is attacked, the [[player]] will get the Poison effect from the cave spider and the Wither effect from the wither skeleton)

== Gameplay ==
* <s>Support for stereoscopic 3D on New 3DS systems is planned for a future update.</s><ref>[[Special:Diff/1147139|Talk page edit by HelenAngel]]</ref>
** As this edition is now discontinued, it will not be added.
* ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' lacks online [[multiplayer]],<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-new-3ds|Minecraft on new 3DS!|September 14, 2017}}</ref> but as of version 1.4, local multiplayer is possible between two people.
* World types are Default and [[Superflat|Flat]]. World sizes are [[World size|Small]] (672×672), [[Medium]] (1344×1344), and [[Large]] (2016×2016). The size of a world cannot be changed once it is created. The ratio of [[The Nether]] to the [[Overworld]] is 1:3.
* The height limit is only 128, as in the Pocket Edition Alpha, although worlds can be larger than the [[Classic (world type)|Classic]] and [[World size|Small]] world types from Legacy Console Edition.
* There is a mob cap that is much stricter than Legacy Console Edition: only 24 enemies, 24 animals, 16 [[squid]], and 16 [[villager]]s can exist at one time. However, there is no cap on [[experience orb]]s, so it is possible to intentionally crash the game by throwing too many [[Bottle o' Enchanting|bottles o' enchanting]]. This was fixed in [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.9.19|1.9]]. There is a separate mob cap between the Overworld, the Nether, and the End dimensions.
* Instead of including the [[map]] item, the map and the player's [[coordinates]] are displayed on the Touch Screen. The Touch Screen is also used for [[inventory]] management and [[crafting]].
* ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' initially includes six skin packs: Standard, Biome Settlers Pack 1, Biome Settlers Pack 2, Redstone Specialists, Journey to the West, and Holiday Skin Pack 2015.
* There are three texture packs available from the start: Minecraft (the default), City, and Plastic. The City texture pack is 32×32.
* As of version 1.5, the Super Mario Mash-Up pack was added, as well as the Super Mario skin packs and texture packs, free of charge.
* As of version 1.7, [[The End]] is now accessible. Prior to the update, Strongholds still existed but the End Portal within them could not be activated.

== Crafting ==
The [[crafting]] menu shares similar block and item categories to that of [[Legacy Console Edition exclusive features#Crafting|Legacy Console Edition]], although armor is grouped with tools. 

As with [[Legacy Console Edition]], blocks and items are placed and grouped in completely different categories and tabs, compared to the Creative inventory.

=== Notes ===
* Crafting entries with an asterisk (*) do not appear [[2×2 grid|outside]] the [[crafting table]].
* As with the Creative inventory, there is no search tab, unlike the [[recipe book]] on ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition''. Players must instead browse the menus to find the item in question, or toggle to show craftable items only.
* The order of items changes depending on the items available in the player's inventory, as such, the order described is based on an empty player inventory.
* Due to the lack of banners and fireworks on ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'', there is no banner crafting or firework crafting tabs, nor a dye crafting tab, unlike Legacy Console Edition.

== Creative inventory ==
The [[Creative inventory]] was similar to that of [[Legacy Console Edition exclusive features#Creative inventory|Legacy Console Edition]], although with slightly different layouts of tabs, blocks, and items; to account for the set of blocks and items available in the Creative inventory on ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''.

A total of 856 different unique items are available in the Creative inventory on ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition''.

=== Differences ===
* There is no search tab, with all of the Creative inventory's items in a single tab, on ''New Nintendo 3DS''. Players must instead browse each individual tab to find the item in question.
* Stairs, slabs, and many colored materials use the old order of stairs, slabs, and colored materials from Legacy Console Edition prior to the [[World of Color Update]]; although colored beds use the same rainbow order as ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition''. Purpur stairs slabs are arranged differently compared to Legacy Console, not previously being placed at the end their sections of stairs and slabs.
* Potions and enchanted books are arranged in a way more like ''Bedrock Edition''.
* Unlike later versions of ''Java Edition'' or ''Bedrock Edition'', spawn eggs are not sorted alphabetically, nor are they sorted with most passive mobs before most hostile ones. Instead, hostile mob spawn eggs are listed before most passive mob spawn eggs; the order of which, has a lot of differences compared to Legacy Console.
* Unlike Legacy Console, all damage levels of anvils, and all levels of enchanted books, are available in the Creative inventory.
* Interestingly, a long mundane variant of lingering potion can be found in the Creative inventory on ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'', like on ''Bedrock Edition'', however, splash and regular potions don't show the long mundane variant. This item is exclusive to ''New Nintendo 3DS'' and cannot be found on either [[Legacy Console Edition]] or ''[[Java Edition]]''.
* Since Bedrock Edition 1.2.0, all blocks and items in the Creative inventory on ''New Nintendo 3DS'', can be obtained in the Creative inventory on ''Bedrock''.

== DLC ==
Version [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.5|1.5]] saw the addition of a online store, which sold texture packs, skins, and one mash-up pack. A few skins from each Skin Pack are available for free, as a demo, and new DLC packs were made available with each subsequent update, until the game was discontinued.
