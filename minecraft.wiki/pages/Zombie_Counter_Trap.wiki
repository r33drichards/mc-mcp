The '''Zombie Counter Trap''' (ゾンビカウンタートラップ, ''Zonbi Kauntā Torappu'') is a trap created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
Due to its nature as a trap, the Zombie Counter Trap blends in to its surroundings, resembling a regular plank on the ground.

== Functionality ==
When the Zombie Counter Trap is stepped on, it suddenly opens, launching whoever stepped on it backwards. As its name implies, it is designed for the creator to stand behind the trap, luring [[Zombie]]s to them and prompting them to step on the trap.
