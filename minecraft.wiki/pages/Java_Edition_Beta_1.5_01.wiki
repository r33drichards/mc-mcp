'''Beta 1.5_01''' is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]] released on April 20, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|notch|60682231227748352|Minecraft 1.5_01 is out, fixing a big pile of bugs|April 20, 2011}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in [[Beta 1.5]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Snow (layers 1) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Snow]]'''
* Now included in replaceable blocks category.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Wolf JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Wolf]]'''
* Spawn rate slightly reduced.

== Fixes ==
'''8 bugs fixed'''
* [[Block]]s can now be placed on [[snow]].
* [[Rain]] no longer goes through translucent blocks.
* Pumpkins are no longer worn backward on the [[player]]. This was also fixed (likely backported) in PC Gamer Demo.
* The game no longer crashes when [[rail]]s are placed next to [[detector rail]]s, or vice versa.
* [[Ladder]]s aren't climbable when spaced every other block.
* [[Wolves]] are less common than in [[Beta 1.5]], but still more common than in [[Beta 1.4]].
* Blocks cannot be placed back into the output slot of [[furnace]]s, thus fixing the [[statistic]] exploit.
* The game attempts to recover the [[world]] when a broken save file is detected.

== Bugs ==
* [[Minecart]]s can no longer be extinguished with [[water]].
* Taking an item out from the player's inventory crafting grid caused the game to crash.
