A '''wind charge''' is a throwable [[item]] that bursts into wind on impact, which can knock [[entities]] into the air and interact with [[door]]s, [[button]]s, [[lever]]s, and similar [[block]]s. They are obtained from [[breeze]]s, which also use a more powerful version as their main attack.

== Usage ==
A wind charge can be thrown by {{control|using}} it. After it is thrown, the wind charge is consumed.

Wind charges have a cooldown of 10 ticks (0.5 seconds) before they can be used again. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay on the wind charge that shrinks and must disappear before the player can use it again. If there are other inventory or hotbar slots containing wind charges, they are covered with the white overlay as well.<ref>{{bug|MC-88236||Ender Pearl/Chorus Fruit/Shield cooldown affects items throughout inventory and containers|WAI}}</ref> They can be used to activate [[button]]s, [[fence gate]]s, [[lever]]s, and non-iron [[trapdoor]]s and [[doors]]. They also ring [[bell]]s, break [[chorus flower]]s, extinguish [[candle]]s, and shatter [[decorated pot]]s.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Wind Charge Launching Player.gif|thumb|A player using the knockback from a wind charge to launch into the air.]]
Wind charges, when fired by players, dispensers, or breezes, fly in a straight line through the air. There is a random offset in a wind charge's trajectory over a cone-shaped region, spreading along the aimed trajectory, which can cause a wind charge to miss its target or hit something else.

When a wind charge directly hits an [[entity]], the entity takes {{hp|1}} [[damage]] and is knocked back 2.5 blocks unless the entity is resistant to knockback (e.g., [[squid]], [[warden]]s, [[ravager]]s). Also, a burst of wind appears and knocks back nearby entities without dealing damage to them. Mobs may be knocked high enough into the air to take additional fall damage upon landing. A wind charge that passes through fire or lava sets fire to any entities that it hits.{{only|bedrock}}

The wind burst also interacts with these blocks:
* ''Non-iron'' [[door]]s and [[trapdoor]]s are flipped.
* [[Fence gate]]s are flipped.
* [[Button]]s are pressed.
* [[Lever]]s are flipped.
* [[Bell]]s are rung and swung.
* Lit [[candle]]s (both standalone and on [[cake]]) are extinguished.

Wind charges can be deflected if hit with another projectile or a melee attack, similar to [[Fireball|ghast fireballs]]. [[Blast Protection]] reduces the knockback effect of wind charges.

Wind charges are distance attenuated by [[liquid]]s such as [[water]] and [[lava]]. They fly in a straight line, similar to fireballs.

Wind charges are two separate entities depending on their source. Wind charges shot by breezes are <code>breeze_wind_charge</code>s, while wind charges shot by players and dispensers are simply <code>wind_charge</code>s. This distinction is in place as the two types of wind charges have some different properties. <code>breeze_wind_charge</code>s cannot be obtained as items.

=== When used by players and dispensers ===
Wind charges fired by players and dispensers deal 10% more knockback than those fired by breezes, but have a much smaller burst area.{{more info|How much smaller? concrete values for both attributes would be helpful.}}

A player launched by wind charges shot by a player or a dispenser accumulates fall damage only when falling below the Y level where the wind burst hit. {{IN|BE}}, when throwing a wind charge, the projectile is slightly offset.

Unlike other forms of projectiles when fired on the move, wind charges slightly offset to whatever direction the shooter is moving, following close to the crosshair.
