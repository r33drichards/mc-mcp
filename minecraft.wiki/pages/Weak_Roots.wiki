'''Weak roots''' are a joke [[block]] added in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Weak roots have no assigned [[tool]], meaning they are mined at the same speed regardless of the tool used. Weak roots never drop as an [[item]] when mined, even with [[Silk Touch]].
{{Breaking row|horizontal=1|Weak Roots|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Weak roots naturally generate in the [[Potato dimension]] in [[wasteland]] biome, connected to a [[powerful potato]].

== Usage ==
Unlike [[strong roots]], weak roots don't grow. To achieve any growth, player must mine and replace the powerful potato block, which causes strong roots to grow from it.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Weak roots are destroyed when pushed by [[piston]]s. They do not stick to sticky pistons, [[slime block]]s or [[honey block]]s.
