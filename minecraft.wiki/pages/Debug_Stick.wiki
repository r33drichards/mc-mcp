The '''debug stick''' is an [[item]] used to edit the [[block states]] of [[block]]s. It is visually identical to a regular [[stick]], but with a glint (as if [[enchanted]]).

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|je}}, the debug stick is obtainable via [[commands]] such as {{cmd|/give}} or {{cmd|/item}}, or the [[Creative inventory]] if the player has the appropriate permissions. It can be obtained only in worlds with commands on.

{{IN|be}}, this item only exists in internal versions and privately released versions.

== Usage ==
The debug stick can be used to change block states. {{control|Hitting}} the block allows players to select the block state key they wish to change. For example, switching between the ''conditional'' and the ''facing'' block state keys for a [[command block]]. {{control|Using}} the block allows them to cycle through the valid values for the block state key, again as an example, the player can make the command block face, ''down'', ''east'', ''north'', ''south'', ''up'', or ''west'' if they chose the ''facing'' block state key. {{control|Sneaking}} while {{control|hitting}} or {{control|using}} cycles through the block state keys or values in reverse order.

It is notable that {{Control|using}} debug stick directly on an interactive block without {{Control|sneaking}} uses the block itself instead of the stick.<ref>{{bug|MC-200199||Right-Clicking on an Interactive Block with Debug Stick Uses the Block Instead of Changing Its States if Not Holding Shift|Invalid}} </ref>

The debug stick cannot be used while in Survival or Adventure mode. It works only in Creative mode with cheats enabled. In modes other than Creative, it acts like a regular item — although when {{control|using}} it on a block, the player swings the stick as if interacting with it (but nothing happens).

== Trivia ==
*An [[add-on]] made by Mineplex was showcased in [[MINECON Live 2019]], which had an editor stick for {{el|be}}, similar to the Debug Stick.<ref>{{ytl|OZqNaEX8208|MINECON Live 2019 @ 1:05:02|Minecraft|September 28, 2019|t=3902}}</ref>
