'''''Minecraft: Shape your World'''''<ref>{{Mcnet|shape-your-world|Shape Your World|May 1, 2024|Owen Jones}}</ref> is a marketing campaign and music video promoting the [[15 Days of Minecraft|15th Anniversary]] of the game. It was uploaded on May 1, 2024, teasing the [[15 Days of Minecraft]] event.

== Summary ==
The video begins with an office meeting where an old man is explaining something related to company economics. A woman in the audience looks bored. Suddenly, a [[Human|man with a guitar]] appears behind the old man and starts singing. The woman gets up from her chair and begins [[Breaking|mining]] through the floor with her fists.

The scene changes to a boy holding [[Carrot|carrots]], luring a [[pig]] from behind a bush. The singing man is sitting on the pig, playing his guitar. The boy leads the pig into a [[Fence|fenced]] area. Next, the singing man walks through the reception of a building. Dust falls from the ceiling, and the woman from the meeting crashes through the broken floor and escapes. The scene shifts to a man running away from a house covered in [[TNT]], connected by [[Redstone Dust|redstone dust]] to a [[lever]]. The man stops, crouches, pulls the lever, and the house explodes.

The singing man is shown riding a [[minecart]] through a [[mineshaft]]. He passes people working on ''Minecraft'' [[Painting|paintings]] and others dancing in blocky movements. The video cuts to a woman mining [[bricks]] with a [[pickaxe]], followed by a boy wearing [[Armor|iron armor]] and equipped with a [[shield]] and [[sword]], deflecting [[Arrow|arrows]]. Another scene shows a woman chopping down a [[tree]] with an [[axe]]. The next scene features a car made of bricks and wood being pushed by the armored boy, the woman with the pickaxe, with the woman chopping the tree going to ride it. The singing man rows past them in a [[boat]], playing his guitar.

The boat hits an elevated area, and the singing man rolls off. He stands up and finds himself at a wedding. The bride and groom cut a blocky [[cake]] with an axe. In the following scene, a girl presses a [[button]] on the [[Log|trunk]] of a tree. This activates a redstone mechanism that opens the [[door]] to a treehouse. Inside, the singing man is lying down, playing his guitar.

Another scene shows a man falling from a great height. As he approaches the ground, the singing man spills a [[Water Bucket|bucket of water]] below him. The man lands safely and continues walking. The final scene shows the singing man standing in the middle of all the people from the video, holding hands in a circle on a [[Plains|grassy plain]]. Large ''Minecraft'' builds can be seen in the background. The camera zooms out as the singing man finishes his song, and the words "''Minecraft - Shape Your World''" appear on the screen.
