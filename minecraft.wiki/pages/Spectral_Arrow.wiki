A '''spectral arrow''' is a type of [[arrow]] that inflicts the [[Glowing]] effect on hit in addition to dealing [[damage]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Picking up arrows ===
{{main|Arrow#Picking up arrows}}
Similarly to regular arrows, players can pick up spectral arrows that have been shot by dispensers, or other players in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode. Unlike regular arrows, spectral arrows shot by an [[Infinity]]-enchanted bow can be picked up, as they are not affected by the enchantment.

=== Bartering ===
Spectral arrows can be obtained through [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s, which has a {{frac|40|469}} (~8.53%) chance to give the [[player]] 6-12 arrows.

== Usage ==
{{main|Arrow#Common properties}}
Spectral arrows share many of the same characteristics as regular arrows as projectiles. See [[Arrow#Common properties]] for information on common properties shared by all arrows. 

=== Special properties ===
A spectral arrow confers the [[Glowing]] status effect for 10 seconds. The Glowing effect creates an outline of the target, which is visible through blocks, and colored based on the target's [[team]] (white by default). Even if a bow is enchanted with [[Infinity]], spectral arrows are still consumed.
