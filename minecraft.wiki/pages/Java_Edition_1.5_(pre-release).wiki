Pre-release '''1.5''' is the first and only pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on March 7, 2013.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-redstone-update-pre-release/|title=Minecraft Redstone Update Pre-release|author=[[Jens Bergensten]]|website=[[Mojang.com]]|date=March 7, 2013}}</ref> Despite the version number being identical, this version differs in code from the full release. This is the first pre-release released in 2013.

This pre-release was later reuploaded, and this reupload was used as the full release of 1.5; see [[Java Edition 1.5]] for that version.

An experimental version of the pre-release was uploaded by [[Dinnerbone]] to [[Mojira]] on March 12, 2013, to try to fix a white line bug.<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-1794?focusedCommentId=51987#comment-51987 MC-1794 (comment 51987)] – [[Nathan Adams]] on Mojira, March 12, 2013.</ref>
