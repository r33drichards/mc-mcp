A '''smoker''' is a block that cooks [[food]] twice as quickly as a [[furnace]], but cannot smelt anything else. It also serves as a [[butcher]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A smoker can be mined and obtained using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it does not drop itself.

Smokers drop their contents when broken.

=== Natural generation ===
Smokers can generate in [[butcher]] houses in [[village]]s.

=== Crafting ===

|type=Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
Smokers cannot be pushed by [[pistons]].{{only|java}}

=== Cooking ===
[[File:Smoker GUI.png|thumb|176px|The GUI for the smoker.]]
{{main|Cooking}}

Smokers are used to cook food [[item]]s twice as fast as a regular [[furnace]], taking only 5 seconds per item instead of 10. It is the counterpart to the [[blast furnace]], which is used to quickly smelt ores, metal tools and armor. When an uncooked food item and a [[fuel]] item are placed into the smoker, the block state changes to {{code|lit}} and the item cooks. Fuel is used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items cooked per fuel stays the same. The product can then be taken out of the output slot in the smoker's interface, or be collected using a [[hopper]].

Smokers cannot cook [[chorus fruit]], as [[popped chorus fruit]] is not edible.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a smoker has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to butcher and claim the smoker as their [[job site block]].

=== Light source ===
Smokers emit a light level of 13 when active, just like normal furnaces.

=== Custom name ===
By default, the interface of a smoker is labeled "Smoker", but this name can be customized by naming it in an [[anvil]] before placing it, or by changing the <code>CustomName</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command{{only|Java}}.

=== Lock ===
{{IN|je}}, a smoker can be "locked" by setting its <code>lock</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command. If a smoker's <code>lock</code> tag is not blank, the smoker cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the <code>lock</code> tag's text. For example, to lock a smoker at (0,64,0) so that the smoker cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Smoker Key", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 <nowiki>{lock:{components:{"custom_name":"Smoker Key"}}}</nowiki>}}.

=== Note blocks ===
Smoker can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
