'''Beta 1.21.120.21''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.120.21''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the second beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.120]], released on September 9, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/39436905010189-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-120-21|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.120.21|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=September 9, 2025}}</ref> which redesigns the [[pause menu]] and fixes some bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Copper Lantern]]''' and '''[[Copper Torch]]'''
* Copper lantern and copper torch have new textures to make them easier to distinguish from regular [[lantern]] and [[torch]].

'''[[Glass]]''' and '''[[Glass Pane]]'''
* Glass blocks and panes will now become slightly transparent if the camera is very close to them.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Copper Golem]]'''
*A copper golem with a flower on its head now drops a [[poppy]] when becoming a statue.

=== General ===
[[File:New_UI_-_Pause Menu_(Bedrock_Preview_1.21.120.21).png|thumb|The redesigned pause menu]]
'''[[Pause menu]]'''
* The pause menu has been updated with a new layout and design.

=== Technical ===
'''AI Goals'''
* Made the schemas for the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.dig}}, {{cd|minecraft:behavior.drink_milk}}, {{cd|minecraft:behavior.avoid_block}}, and {{cd|minecraft:behavior.avoid_mob_type}} stricter when parsing and will fail to load an entity JSON that has invalid data in versions 1.21.120 and newer.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* Custom blocks with textures in the {{cd|variations}} array no longer require the Upcoming Creator Features [[experiment]] toggle to work properly.
* The parameter {{cd|sampleWidth}} was removed from the [[water]] configuration JSON file, and consequently the file has a new format and was upgraded to version 1.21.120.

'''GDK'''
* ''Minecraft Preview'' for Windows now runs on the latest GDK (Game Development Kit).
** This update aligns the game with the standard distribution model on Windows platforms.
* File paths have been updated and upon first install load of this version of ''Minecraft Preview'', existing ''Minecraft'' worlds and content will shift to: {{Cd|%APPDATA%\Minecraft Bedrock Preview}}.
* Some players will still receive the UWP version of ''Minecraft Preview'' as this slowly rolls out for testing.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "Render Dragon Features for Creators" [[experimental]] toggles.

=== Additions ===
==== Techincal ====
'''[[API]]'''
* Added the {{cd|BlockRedstoneProducerComponent}} to {{cd|beta}}.
** Added {{cd|power}} read-only property.
** Added {{cd|getStronglyPoweredFace}} method.
** Added {{cd|getConnectedFaces}} method.

=== Changes ===
==== Techincal ====
'''API'''
* Dimension
** Removed {{cd|CompoundBlockVolume}} parameter from {{cd|fillBlocks}} in {{cd|beta}}.
* [[Loot table]] discovery API now includes information about Loot Item Conditions.

'''Graphical'''
* Updated point light tracking to be able to link to custom blocks.
