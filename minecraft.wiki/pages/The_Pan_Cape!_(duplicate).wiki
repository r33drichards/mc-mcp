The duplicate version of '''The Pan Cape!''' was originally the [[Mojang Studios Cape]], a cape meant exclusively for [[Mojang employees]]. Due to an exploit, the cape could be obtained by the public, and its design was changed to that of [[The Pan Cape!]]. The Mojang Studios Cape was then added again separately after the exploit had been fixed.

== Appearance ==
This cape appears identical to the [[The Pan Cape!]].

== Distribution ==
On December 10, 2021, this cape is given to those employed by Mojang Studios.

On December 13, 2021, it was discovered that the Mojang Studios Cape was available to purchase on the Marketplace through illegitimate means, however it was always available.

The cape was soon delisted.{{more info needed|What date (and time if possible) did it become to be delisted?}} Those who obtained the cape while it was still available were able to keep and use it.
