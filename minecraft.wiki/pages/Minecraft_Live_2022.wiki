It announced the [[Trails & Tales]] update as [[Java Edition 1.20]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.0]], the next update after [[The Wild Update]], and contained the [[2022 Mob Vote]]. in which the [[sniffer]] won over the other two mobs, the rascal and the  tuff golem. This was the last Minecraft Live to be performed live.

Minecraft Live 2022 announced the yet-unnamed [[Java Edition 1.20|1.20]] update to ''[[Minecraft]]'', which includes the voted-in [[sniffer]], [[Camel|camels]], [[Block of Bamboo|bamboo wood]], [[Hanging Signs|hanging signs]], [[Chiseled Bookshelf|chiseled bookshelves]] and [[Bamboo Raft|rafts]]. On March 2, 2023, the name of 1.20 was revealed, [[Trails & Tales]]. New seasonal adventures in {{el|mcd}} and new information about {{el|mcl}} were also announced. New default skins were announced to arrive in the game in a future update as well, which were later added in [[Java Edition 1.19.3]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.19.50]], respectively.

=== Main Show ===
As the show begins, several [[Frog|frogs]] leap in front of the [[Mojang Studios]] logo. [[Lydia Winters]] appears and introduces herself, explaining what's to come while standing in front of an animatronic [[pig]]. From there a [[Mojang cinematics|cinematic]] commences, continuing off the events of the announcement trailer. A minecart chain containing many [[Mob|mobs]] venture through a [[savanna]] and several other [[Biome|biomes]] on their way to the show. Along the way, several visual jokes are made, including [[Chicken|chickens]] being blown away by the carts, a [[husk]] sneezing onto a [[Magma Cube|magma cube]], and the [[Dungeons:Arch-Illager|Arch Illager]] expressing joy at the wonders of a [[Lush Caves|lush cave]]. 

Eventually, the cars are stopped by a trio of frogs "vibing" to a song while marching in a [[Mushroom Fields|mushroom field]], a callback to the announcement trailer, agitating the separate trio of frogs leading the track. After they leave, [[Alex]] refuels their [[Minecart with Furnace|furnace minecart]], continuing forward into the [[The Nether|Nether]], [[Ocean|underwater]], and finally into the [[Legends:Fatelands|Fatelands]], where several runts are on top of a [[Legends:Village|village]] well. As a [[Chicken Jockey|chicken jockey]] tries to keep up in a [[badlands]] biome, the Overworld is blinded by the sight of the event logo, ending the animation.

{{Main|Mob Vote}}[[File:MCLive2022MobVoteAllOptions.png|thumb|right|The three options for the mob vote.]]

As with previous events, viewers were able to vote for a new mob to be added to the game in a future update. Each mob received its own video justifying its inclusion.

Unlike previous years, in which the vote was conducted through Twitter during the show, the vote began on October 14 at noon EDT and ended the following day as the show began. The vote took place across three areas: a server on {{BE}}, through the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'', and on [[minecraft.net]]. Users were also able to change their vote during the 24-hour period.<ref>{{mcnet|minecraft-live-2022-back|Minecraft Live 2022 is back|September 8, 2022|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

The mobs that were on the vote were the sniffer, the rascal, and the tuff golem.

* The [[sniffer]]<ref>{{ytl|MPJ2dzVcOgg|Minecraft Live 2022: Vote for the Sniffer!|Minecraft|October 4, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2022-sniffer|Mob Vote 2022 Sniffer|October 4, 2022|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> is described as an ancient mob, that was thought to have been extinct, that is hatched from [[sniffer egg]]s, which can be found in chests in underwater ruins. This means they do not spawn naturally, and are extinct until revived by the player. Upon hatching, the sniffer can find ancient seeds, which can be used to grow new types of plants, which will also come with the sniffer. The sniffer won the vote by over half of the vote, and was added in the [[1.20]] update.

* The [[rascal]]<ref>{{ytl|9NXbtp9uhOI|Minecraft Live 2022: Vote for the Rascal!|Minecraft|October 5, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2022-rascal|Mob Vote 2022 Rascal|October 5, 2022|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> was a mob that would have been found underground in areas below y{{=}}0. The rascal would have given the player hints to help search for it, and would have also given the player an item if it was found three times. Once the rascal rewards the player with the item after it is found it will teleport away.

* The [[tuff golem]]<ref>{{ytl|5EYP3_yRD1k|Minecraft Live 2022: Vote for the Tuff Golem!|Minecraft|October 6, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2022-tuff-golem|Mob Vote 2022 Tuff Golem|October 6, 2022|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> was a golem that would have been built by the player; if a wool block was included while building it, the tuff golem would have worn a cloak matching the color of the wool block. The tuff golem was described as a statue that would have held and displayed any item, but when it wakes up, it would have also moved around while either holding an item, or pick up an item if it is not holding one. The tuff golem would have returned back to the spot that it woke up from before turning back into a statue. The tuff golem was one block tall so players can also stack them.

==== Result ====
The result was announced at the end of the show. It was stated during the show that over 3.5 million votes were cast<ref>{{ytl|iM9KtHaDcUg| Minecraft Live 2022 @ 1:07:57|Minecraft|October 15, 2022|t=4070}}</ref>, with the winning mob, the [[sniffer]], accounting for more than half of the votes. The number of votes for each mob were disclosed after the show.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1581377147838439424| The sniffer received more than half of your votes! 🤯<br><br>Mob Vote 2022 results:<br>Sniffer - 55.1%<br>Rascal - 27.7%<br>Tuff golem - 17.2%<br><br>#MinecraftLive|October 15, 2022}}</ref>
