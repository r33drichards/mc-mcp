'''"13"''' (in-game) or '''Thirteen''' (soundtrack name) refers to both a song composed by [[C418]], and a [[music disc]] that plays the song when inserted in a [[jukebox]]. The music disc is obtained from [[creeper]]s killed by [[skeleton]]s, or from various structures, where it is commonly found in [[monster room]]s and [[woodland mansion]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
When killed by any [[skeleton]], [[stray]], [[bogged]], or [[parched]] (or [[wither skeleton]] if given a [[bow]] using commands), a [[creeper]] drops a random music disc, which has a {{frac|1|12}} chance to be "13".

Because [[TNT]] ignited by a flaming [[arrow]] attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with [[Flame]], or shooting through [[lava]] or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.<ref>{{bug|MC-210303|||WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-150884|||WAI}}</ref>

{{Q|No human was harmed in the making of this recording.|C418|bandcamp.com}}
{{Q|“Thirteen” is a creepy little record you can find in Minecraft. I always wanted the player to find it somewhere deep within a cave, because it’s being played by a device, creating a creepy atmosphere. But it turns out it’s just a creepy song being played. We never actually did that in the game though.|C418|c418.org}}
[[File:13.ogg]]

"13" is a somewhat unsettling, cave-themed ambient piece consisting mostly of echoed synthesized ambient sounds that closely resemble those that play in the game's caves, resonating metallic clinks, and quiet wind blowing. The entire track is wholly engulfed in reverb.

At different points in the piece, muffled bow firings, a heavily reverbed hiss followed by a subsequent heavily reverbed explosion and echoed splashes can be heard in the background. The track goes silent for 8 seconds at the 1:30 mark.

The album version of "13" continues into "[[Excuse]]".

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "13" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "13", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 1.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The title "13" is a reference to the 13 cave ambience sounds that existed when the disc was added. Similar sounds can be heard throughout the track. 
* Because "13" was created in 2010, it actually uses older sound effects from earlier versions of the game for bow firing{{sound||Bow Shooting Old.ogg}}, arrow impacts{{sound||Arrow Old.ogg}}, explosions{{sound||Explosion Old.ogg}}, and water splashing{{sound||Water Splash Old.ogg}}, which have since been replaced. 
** The background noise also bears resemblance to a deeper version of the unused and removed [[Java Edition removed features#Audio loops|cave chimes]]{{sound||Cave chimes.ogg}}. Before the explosion, there was also the sound of a creeper fuse{{sound||Creeper fuse.ogg}} which is still used.
* C418 initially wanted the music disc to be found deep underground in a cave in-game, being played by some device.<ref>https://c418.org/albums/minecraft-volume-alpha/</ref>
