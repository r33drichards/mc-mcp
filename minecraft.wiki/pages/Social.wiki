[[File:Ore UI - Pause Menu - "Social" Tab Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The Social drawer allows access to all online social features in the game.]]
''Minecraft'' has several '''social''' features for connecting people with aspects from the game. Using the {{w|Xbox network}}, players can add online friends, [[Multiplayer|play together]], and share user data.

== Xbox network ==
{{Hatnote|Manage the Xbox profile [https://xbox.com/play/user here]}}
[[File:Xbox Minecraft profile.png|thumb|The Xbox profile in the Xbox app, on the ''Minecraft for Windows'' page.]]
When a player is signed in with a Microsoft account in-game, their ''Minecraft'' profile is synchronized with their Xbox profile. Most profile data generated in-game is visible in the Xbox profile, and vice versa. Unlike ''[[Java Edition]]'', the player's "Minecraft account" is the same as the player's Xbox account, instead of a separate username within the Microsoft account. The game can also be played without a Microsoft account, but all online features and achievements are inaccessible.

The Xbox account determines the '''gamertag''' of the user shown in-game, which can be different from their ''Java Edition'' username. The functionality of this gamertag is identical, it is the player's name visible for other players and required for certain [[commands]] selecting the player. The gamertag can be changed one time for free on the Xbox profile.

The Xbox profile has various social features and collects data from all games, social networks, and accounts connected to the profile. All instances of ''Minecraft'' can be purchased and managed, including all ''Bedrock Edition'' and ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'' versions for platforms, ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' (plus [[Dungeons:Downloadable content|DLC]]), ''[[Minecraft Legends]]'', and the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''. ''Minecraft for Windows'' is available for free for members of the "family group", when their Xbox accounts are connected to an Xbox account owning ''Minecraft''. Other features in the Xbox profile include managing the Game Pass (which includes ''Minecraft''), managing Xbox consoles, online status, activity feed, and tracking ''Minecraft'' profile data. Using a friends system, players can search and see any Xbox profile and add players as friends or follow them, allowing access to (group) chats, voice calls, and in-game social features.

On Windows computers, the Xbox Game Bar can be opened at any time (even in-game) with {{Keys|Win+G}}. Acting as an overlay, certain widgets from the Xbox app can be opened, including social features, [[screenshot]] and screen recording features, and device controls. The Xbox Game Bar also controls notifications including achievements and multiplayer invites. On Xbox consoles, most features from the Xbox Game Bar can be used in-game.

=== Privacy & online safety ===
Features from the Xbox network can be customized in the [https://www.xbox.com/user/settings/privacy-and-safety Xbox privacy settings], which notably affect the player's online experience in ''Minecraft''. Depending on the date of birth connected to the player's Microsoft account, these options may be locked and can only be edited from parental accounts. Parental accounts can also edit the privacy settings from other Xbox accounts connected to the "family group". Settings that affect ''Minecraft'' include visibility of profiles, friend and follower lists, online status, real name (if assigned), allowing friend requests/following, [[telemetry]] data, [[multiplayer]], and [[profanity filter]]ing. Most privacy settings can be changed to make them fully private, only visible for friends, or visible for anyone.

== PlayStation Network ==
On PlayStation consoles, the player's account is connected to the [[W:PlayStation Network|PlayStation Network]] instead of the Xbox network.{{Info needed|Can players also sign in with their Microsoft account to sync their gamertag and Xbox friends?}} While this offers mostly the same functionality as the Xbox network, profile data is collected separately and a different set of friends can be used. Unique features from the PlayStation Network are tracking and the rewards system of [[trophies]] instead of achievements, and the Marketplace is replaced by a "Store" connected to the [[W:PlayStation Store|PlayStation Store]]. The content and functionality is the same as the Marketplace, but packs are sold separately with [[tokens]].

== Features ==
{{See also|Tutorial:Menu screen/Bedrock Edition}}
Most features from the Xbox network are visible in-game, plus some additional functionality.

=== Profile ===
[[File:Ore UI - Profile Screen Menu "Overview" Tab (Bedrock).png|thumb|The Profile screen.]]
On the right side of the [[Inbox screen|Inbox]] button on the main menu and from any player button in other menus, the '''profile screen''' can be opened. A player's profile button shows the Xbox gamertag, an auto-generated skin face, and the online status. The online status can be either online (with a green dot) or offline, and activity in ''Minecraft'' games is shown below the name, such as "Playing Minecraft Dungeons", "In the Menus", and "Playing on a Realm - Creative Mode". On the profile screen, the player's real name can also be shown. In ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', a render of the currently selected skin is visible on the profile page.

[[Achievements]] can be accessed from the profile screen. For each achievement, the progress, gamerscore, requirements, and rewards are shown and can be expanded. The profile tracks all achievement progress, and general progress including percentage, rewards, and gamerscore. Achievement progress can also be viewed in the Xbox profile and is stored per game, meaning that achievements can be obtained multiple times for each platform version of ''Minecraft''. Redeemed achievement rewards are available on devices where the achievement has not been completed. The gamerscore is added to the general gamerscore in the Xbox profile, merged with gamerscore awarded from other games.

On PlayStation, the player earns trophies instead of achievements and gamerscore is not tracked, but rewards can still be obtained.

The game tracks four statistics on the Xbox profile, separated for each platform. These include the total amount of time played (in a world or server), the total amount of [[Block|blocks]] broken, all [[Mob|mobs]] killed, and the total distance traveled.

Lists of friends and followers can be opened from the profile screen which are synchronized to the Xbox profile.

==== Screenshots ====
[[File:Ore UI - Manage Showcase Gallery Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|A player's own showcase gallery.]]
When signed in, the player can take [[screenshots]] in-game from the [[pause menu]] or with a hotkey. Up to 100 are stored locally on the device and are not synchronized with the Xbox profile, but they are stored separately for each signed in player and can only be viewed from the profile screen. In the screenshot gallery, all screenshots can be managed and viewed, shared externally, or set it as a [[world]] thumbnail.

Up to 5 screenshots can be added to the showcase gallery, and one can be selected as featured screenshot. These screenshots are uploaded to the Xbox profile and visible for anyone with access to the profile, both in ''Minecraft'' and the Xbox app. The featured screenshot shows on the left side of the profile page, which defaults to a set of internal screenshots.

==== Other players ====
[[File:Ore UI - Profile (Other Player) Screen Menu "Overview" Tab (Bedrock).png|thumb|The profile screen of a different player.]]
Depending on the privacy settings, the profile page is (partially) visible for any other user in-game and in the Xbox app, and the player can view profiles from any other player using the player search feature or social drawer. For profiles of other players, the showcase gallery and featured screenshot can be seen, the gamerscore and achievement progress (but not individual achievements), the friends list, and statistics. The statistics can be compared to the player's own statistics, represented by blue and orange bars depicting the distribution of progress.

=== Friends ===
[[File:Ore UI - Multiplayer Screen Menu "Social" Tab - Friends Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The Social drawer in the [[play]] screen.]]
The Social drawer, accessible from the [[Play]] screen and the [[pause menu]], provides access to other players profiles and usage of the Xbox friends system. Through the "Search for players" menu, any player can be searched with their gamertag. The screen also shows recommended friends (followers, friends of friends, and previous friends), and players recently played with but not friends. It also allows to search for players using a QR code or share link containing the gamertag.

Any profile found in-game can be added as friend, which makes the player show on the social drawer and the friends list. At this point, the friend is considered ''added'', and the player who added them shows as ''follower'' for the friend. The friend can then add the player as well to make the friendship mutual, considered ''friends''. Friends and followers are visible in the Xbox app and for other players. Friends can be removed at any time, leaving the friend as follower if the friendship was mutual.

Friends can be marked as favorite to pin them to the top of all friend lists. Favorite friends show a heart-shaped online status icon. A player can be removed from favorites at any time.

Players can be blocked or muted. Blocking a player removes them from both the friends list and followers list and prevents them from appearing on any social feature again. Muting makes the player unable to join multiplayer worlds or send invites through the social network. Both actions can be undone from the profile screen.

=== Multiplayer ===
{{Main|Multiplayer}}Through the social network, players can join each other's multiplayer [[worlds]]. When players are mutual friends and not muted, all worlds with multiplayer enabled for friends in the [[edit world]] screen show as multiplayer worlds on the [[Play screen]]. A player can also be joined in the social drawer or from their profile screen. Multiplayer can be extended to friends of friends, which enables the option for joining a game from a player's profile in a friend's friends list.

A mutual friend's game can also be joined when they are playing in a [[server]]{{Verify|Tested for featured servers, includes external servers?}} or [[Realms|Realm]]. The latter requires access to the Realm, and also shows on the worlds tab of the Play screen.

In a world, Realm, or server, friends can be invited to join, where the friendship does not need to be mutual. This will send a notification from the Xbox app, and allows the player to join the world. Multiplayer game can be limited to invited players only. On a Realm, only members can be invited. The owner of the Realm can invite (non-mutual) friends at any time to the Realm, which will send an invite message to the player's [[Inbox]].

While in a world, active players can be found and managed in the social drawer in the [[pause menu]]. The host can change [[player permissions]], or kick the player. Players on Realms can also be banned, to prevent them from re-joining using invite links.

Members of a Realm server have access to [[Realms Stories]], which allows players to view activity data, members, and story posts. Screenshots can be uploaded to Realms Stories, which also uploads them to the Xbox profile (but remains private), making the screenshots accessible from any other device.

Other features from multiplayer games, including [[World Options#Multiplayer|multiplayer settings]], the [[chat]], and other interactions are managed on the multiplayer world or server outside the social features.

=== Parties ===
{{In development|bedrock|3=26.0|section=1}}
[[File:New UI - Pause Menu - Social Tab Screen Menu - Party Tab (Bedrock Preview 26.0.25).png|thumb|A party in the Social drawer in the pause menu, when the player is in a different world from the host.]]
'''Parties''' are groups of online players that can automatically join any world the owner is in. From the "Party" tab in the Social drawer, any party can be created or joined. A party can be created as an "Open" or "Invite only" party. Open parties are visible for any friends in the "Joinable parties" section, while invite only parties requires the leader to send an invite to join a party. Invites can be sent to online friends (not mutual) or players recently played with, and can be resent at any time. In the [[Settings#Party|Party settings]], the right to invite players can be extended to members of the party, allowing more people to join.
[[File:Party moving toast.png|thumb|The [[Toasts|toast]] that appears when a party is moving, and the player joins the world in seconds.]]
A party can have up to 15 members. When the leader joins a [[multiplayer]] world, all members of the party automatically join the world in a few seconds. Members are not required to join the world and can re-join at any other time. The leader can also join the world of a friend to move the party to that world; it is not required that the leader hosts the world. The leader can transfer the leadership to other members in the party.

The "Social" button shows player faces of the first four members of a joined party. The online status icon changes to blue for members of a party, and the leader has an additional icon.

=== Reporting ===
[[File:Ore UI - Report Bad Behavior Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The Report Bad Behavior screen when reporting a player.]]
Players can be reported to Mojang Studios staff in their profile screen. Additionally, the options for a [[screenshot]] in a player's showcase gallery and a post in [[Realms Stories]] allow to report content. For the latter, the report will be sent to Xbox Enforcement instead of Mojang Studios.
