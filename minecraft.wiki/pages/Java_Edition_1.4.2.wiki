=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Impulse Command Block JE1.png|32px]] [[Command block]]s'''
* Run editable commands when triggered by redstone
* Intended for adventure maps
* Can only be edited by ops in Creative mode, as long as <code>enable-command-block</code> in server.properties is enabled
* Only obtainable using {{cmd|give <''playername''> 137}}
* Can operate in silent mode where it doesn't display commands in the chat box

'''[[File:Beacon JE4 BE1.png|32px]] [[Beacon]]s'''
* Intended as an endgame block
* Continuously glows and gives a selected status effect to players within 16 blocks while beaming a beacon of light directly upwards (as bright as glowstone)
* Activated by building a solid pyramid of iron/gold/emerald/diamond blocks underneath and selecting an effect
** The cheapest configuration requires 9 blocks, while the best configuration requires 164 blocks
* Has to be directly exposed to the skylight to work
* Building square platforms of increasing size and the same material per layer activates it and increases range and status effect selection
* Viable materials are iron, gold, diamond, and emerald blocks
* Changing selected status effects costs 1 emerald, diamond, gold ingot, or iron ingot
* Gives off a light level of 15
* Unlockable effects, with an increasing amount of required layers of blocks required:
** [[Speed]] and [[Haste]]
** [[Resistance]] and [[Jump Boost]]
** [[Strength]]
* When all 4 layers of blocks underneath are built correctly, a second status effect can be chosen
** This second status effect is [[Regeneration]] or tier II of the previously chosen effect
* Effects given by the beacon have less intrusive particles than others on the screen, such as those of potions

'''{{Animate|Anvil JE1 BE1.png; Chipped Anvil JE1 BE1.png; Damaged Anvil JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Anvil]]s'''
* Used for repairing and combining enchanted items as well as for renaming any item/block at the cost of experience levels
* Tools can also be repaired using one piece of their material
* Enchantments that are the same are upgraded by one level as long as they are both the same level and the higher level exists
* Conflicting enchantments are removed and only the first one is kept
* Becomes damaged from using and dropping it - damage persists in inventory and splits up into 3 separate blocks: anvil, slightly damaged anvil, & very damaged anvil
* Can be placed in 4 orientations, but can't be moved by pistons
* Experience level cost depends on enchantment levels & rarities, whether the item is being renamed and whether the item has been used with an anvil before - maximum experience level cost is 39 levels, unless in Creative mode
** For a more detailed explanation of how enchantments are combined using the anvil, see the ''[[Anvil mechanics]]'' page
* Is affected by gravity and does 1 heart of damage to mobs and players it falls on per block it fell, excluding the first one - Players killed by a falling anvil cause the death message "''Player'' was squashed by a falling anvil" to appear in the chat
* Certain blocks are destroyed when an anvil falls on them: [[lever]]s, [[button]]s, [[torch]]es, [[redstone torch]]es, [[redstone repeater]]s, [[flower pot]]s, [[rail]]s, & mob [[head]]s

'''[[File:Flower Pot.png|32px]] [[Flower pot]]s'''

* Nearby pigs flock towards players holding it
* Pigs start slow but end up going about 5 [[block]]s per second
* Slowly loses [[durability]] when riding pigs
* The pigs 'eat' the [[carrot]] eventually, leaving the player a [[fishing rod]] and requiring another carrot to continue riding
* Can be {{control|used}} to give the pig a short speed boost

* Shoots two kinds of projectile - a blue one from the little heads, targeting mobs, and a dark one from the big head targeting players

* Preset format with example: 95;35:2;2x20;1;stronghold – 95 is the format version, followed by a semicolon and the layer information. Every new layer is separated by a comma and must consist of the block id (<code>35</code>) and can additionally have <code>:2</code> appended to specify <code>2</code> as the data value. Before that, the player can put <code>2x</code> to specify that this layer should be put <code>2</code> times. After a semicolon follows the biome id. After another semicolon follows all structures to be generated, including their options.
