An '''iron shovel''' is a variant of [[shovel]] that is crafted from [[iron ingot]]s. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the third-highest [[tier]] of shovel, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack damage, durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[copper shovel]].

==== Equipment ====
{{Main|Drops#Equipped items}}

[[Zombie]]s and [[husk]]s have a 0.67% (3.33% in Hard [[difficulty]]) chance of spawning with an iron shovel. They have an 8.5% (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) chance of dropping that shovel if they are killed by the player. The dropped shovel is usually badly damaged, and may be enchanted: 0%–25% on Normal difficulty and 3.125%–25% on Hard difficulty, varying with [[regional difficulty]], and enchanted as if on an [[enchanting table]] at level 5–22.

==== Raids ====
Vindicators and pillagers that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on Hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron shovel that is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment.{{only|bedrock}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources|Enchanted Iron Shovel}}

== Usage ==
=== Digging ===
An iron shovel can be used to break dirt and soil-type materials faster. When breaking a block, it uses 1 durability. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

=== Mining snow ===
An iron shovel can be used to break [[Snow Block|snow blocks]] or [[snow]] to obtain [[Snowball|snow balls]] without Silk Touch.

=== Dirt paths ===
An iron shovel can be used to create a [[dirt path]] by {{control|using}} (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}

=== Campfire ===
An iron shovel can be used to extinguish a [[campfire]].

=== Weapon ===
Iron shovels use 2 durability when used as a weapon.

==== {{JE}} ====
Iron shovels have an attack speed modifier of -3, meaning they take 1 second to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]]. Iron shovels deal {{hp|4.5}} damage.

==== {{BE}} ====
Iron shovels always attack instantly and do {{hp|4}} damage.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

An iron shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 62 durability points (25% of maximum durability). Two iron shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
An iron shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
