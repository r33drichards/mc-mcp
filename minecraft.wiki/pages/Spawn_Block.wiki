'''Spawn Block''' was a block that could be used by players in ''[[MinecraftEdu]]'' to set the world [[spawn point]].

== Usage ==
Placing a spawn block would update the world spawn point to that location. If a spawn block already existed in the world, the spawn point would always be overwritten in favor of the newest block. Breaking the active spawn block would reset the spawn point to the world origin, ignoring any other spawn blocks placed previously.

A spawn point set by a spawn block behaved identically to a world spawn point set by using commands. Student players also had the ability to teleport themselves to the current spawn block from their student menu. 

== Behavior ==
* Placing the block immediately resets the spawn point and a visual note is displayed with the new coordinates.
* Destroying the spawn block does not alter the current spawn point.
* Placing multiple spawn blocks simply resets the spawn point to last location placed.
* Students cannot destroy a spawn block, even when student building is enabled.
* Teachers can break a spawn block at any time.

== Availability ==
* Block can be found in creative inventory. Only teachers can see this block in their inventory.
* Can also be given in [[Teacher menu]] "give" section.
* Can be distributed by console command or with a [[command block]].

== Data values ==
ID of this block is '''3725'''.
