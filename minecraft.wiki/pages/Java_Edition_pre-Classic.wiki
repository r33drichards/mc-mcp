'''Pre-Classic''' is the name given to the prototype versions of ''Minecraft'' (what is now {{JE}}) developed before [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]]. It was the very first development phase of the game, lasting for not even a week; very early development of the game started around May 10<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.minecraft.net/about.jsp|title=About the game|website=Minecraft|date=June 2009|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090615065538/http://www.minecraft.net/about.jsp}}</ref> or 11<ref name="11th">[https://archive.org/download/Rotab-Minecraft-IRC-logs Rotab's IRC logs] on Archive.org; #minecraft.20090525.log. May 25, 2009 (UTC+2). "''(10:40:09) <@Notch> heh, the game game tech test video is from the 13'th''"[...]"''(10:40:18) <@Notch> that was after two days of work, so I started the 11'th, probably''"</ref> before ending a week later on May 16, 2009. There were no pre-Classic versions publicly released at the time. The original title was "''Cave Game''" until it was changed to "''Minecraft: Order of the Stone''", then to simply "''Minecraft''".

This phase began when [[Markus Persson]] (Notch) started working on a "Cave Game". He was influenced to create the game by ''[[Infiniminer]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Dwarf Fortress|Dwarf Fortress]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Dungeon Keeper|Dungeon Keeper]]'', as well as one of his previous games, ''[[RubyDung]]''.

The textures used for [[Grass Block|grass]] and [[stone]] blocks (the latter eventually being reworked for [[cobblestone]]) were from said game, and internally, the game's class files referred to it as "RubyDung". Other blocks and items were soon added, such as [[sapling]]s, [[dirt]], [[stone]], and [[planks]]. [[Mob (entity)|Mob]]s, which would later become the [[player]] model, were also added, with their model and texture reused from another of Notch's earlier games, ''[[Zombie Town]]''.

Little is known about this development phase, since it was never publicly released, and only Notch could test the versions. Some versions in this phase could previously be seen in videos on Notch's [[YouTube]] channel [[Nizzotch]], though most of the videos have been blocked in most countries for unknown reasons.

[[Cave game tech test|A tech test]] was shown in Notch's [{{ytl|F9t3FREAZ-k}} "Cave game tech test" video] ([{{ytl|ToEFJC1xjU8}}<nowiki> archive]) on May 13, 2009. The ability to place blocks was not present at the time.</nowiki>

This stage of development ended less than a week later on May 16, 2009. Four pre-Classic versions were later made available to the public through the [[launcher]], with the earliest being [[rd-132211]], originally developed on May 13, 2009. All of them are modified in 2013, making them technically not original.

== Trivia ==
* Breaking a block doesn't drop anything, as the ability to drop an item was not yet added.
* When loading a pre-Classic version using the [[launcher]], instead of the window title being "Minecraft" it is simply titled "Game".
* The name "Order of the Stone" was later reused in the spin-off game ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'' as [[Minecraft Story Mode:Order of the Stone|a legendary team of adventurers]].
* The [[Version formats#Pre-Classic|naming system in this phase]] Mojang retroactively used is "rd-''ddhhmm''", where "rd" stands for ''[[RubyDung]]'', an earlier project of Notch's, and the ''ddhhmm'' part is a timestamp referring to the build time in the Europe/Stockholm timezone: ''dd'' is day of the month, ''hh'' is the hour, and ''mm'' is the minute released, so for example, [[rd-132211]] was built on May '''13''' at '''22:11'''. An exception to this system is [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-20090515|rd-20090515]], which instead uses the full date in the year-month-day format.
* All pre-Classic versions that were made are considered [[Missing Java Edition versions|lost]] as the only archives of each version were modified on August 6, 2013.
