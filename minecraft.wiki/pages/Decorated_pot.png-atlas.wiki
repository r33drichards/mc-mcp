| All textures now have an extra pixel of padding in all four directions. This negatively impacts tiling efficiency.<ref>{{bug|MC-303675}}</ref>

==== Mipmapped versions ====
Before 25w31a, ''Minecraft'' generated mipmapped versions of this atlas, for unknown reasons. They were not used by the game at all - only blocks placed in the world which use the json model system use mipmapped textures.<ref>{{bug|MC-277473}}</ref>
