[[File:Debug controls.png|thumb|The list of debug keybinds as shown in-game under {{UI|[[Options]]|Controls|Key Binds}}.]]
A '''debug hotkey''' (or '''key binding''' in game) is used to access hidden information and trigger advanced settings in the game through {{Keys|F3 + ''<key>''}}, where ''key'' is usually a letter (A&ndash;Z), or just a single {{Key|F3}}, which is used to open the [[debug screen]]. When {{Key|F3}} is used as a modifier for debug hotkey combination, the debug screen is not opened (or closed if enabled).

The list for debug hotkeys can be viewed and changed under the "Debug" section of {{UI|[[Options]]|Controls|Key Binds}}.

Some debug hotkeys may be disabled by {{gmr|reduced_debug_info}} game rule.
