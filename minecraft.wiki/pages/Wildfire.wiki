The '''wildfire''', originally known as '''Mob D''' or the "'''Hovering Inferno'''", was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2017 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during ''[[MINECON Earth 2017]]'', alongside the [[barnacle]], the [[phantom]] and the [[great hunger]].<ref>{{mcnet|announcing-minecon-earth|Announcing... MINECON Earth|August 8, 2017|Owen Jones}}</ref>

It was a type of [[blaze]] with its body parts looking like [[shield]]s in order to defend itself from attacks. This mob would spawn with groups of blazes randomly to attack the player in the [[Nether]] with a dangerous shock wave attack. [[Jens Bergensten]] argued that viewers should vote for Mob D because it would make the Nether "even more scary and exciting".<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|931160039649431554|Choose which mob makes it into Minecraft during this year's MINECON Earth!
