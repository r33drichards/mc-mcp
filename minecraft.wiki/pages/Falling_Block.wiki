A '''falling block''' is the [[entity]] form of a block that appears when a gravity-affected block loses its support.

== Spawning ==
Falling blocks naturally spawn where gravity-affected [[block]]s lose their base of support. These blocks include:

{{IN|java}}, falling block entities can be spawned through {{cmd|summon}}. By tweaking the <code>BlockState</code> NBT tag, it is possible to summon any block as a falling block entity.

Although it has the same appearance as its corresponding block and is also affected by gravity, [[primed TNT]] is a different [[entity]].

== Behavior ==
A falling block continues falling until it lands on another block with a solid top surface. If it lands with the bottom center of its [[Hitbox#Entity|hitbox]] in a replaceable block ([[grass]], [[fluids]], [[vines]], [[air]], etc.), and the block below can support it (i.e. not a replaceable block), then the falling block returns to its block state. Otherwise, it breaks and drops as an [[Item (entity)|item]].

Like most other [[entities]], falling blocks are affected by [[explosion]]s and [[bubble column]]s, can be launched by a moving [[slime block]], can be pushed by [[piston]]s, can be slowed down by [[cobweb]]s, can slide down the side of a [[honey block]], and can travel through [[nether portal|nether]] and [[end portal]]s. However, they do not bounce on a stationary slime block and can neither be pushed nor slowed down by [[water]] or [[lava]].

Falling blocks pass through most entities without colliding with them, although projectiles such as [[arrow]]s bounce off them. They do not have [[health]], cannot be attacked and do not take [[damage]]. They are also immune to all [[status effect]]s.

By default, a falling block that has existed for more than 600 ticks (30 seconds) destroys itself and drops as an item. This can be changed by modifying the entity's <code>Time</code> NBT value. [[Suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]] also drop themselves after falling for more than 30 seconds,<ref>{{bug|MC-260073||Suspicious sand/gravel drops as an item after 30 seconds of existing as falling block|WF}}</ref> making this the only way to obtain suspicious blocks in [[Survival]] mode.{{only|java}}

Commands such as {{cmd|data}}{{only|java}} can change the moving and facing directions of a falling block, although there are no in-game mechanics that can alter a falling block's facing direction. They can be removed with the {{cmd|kill}} command.

Some falling blocks, like anvils and pointed dripstone, deal damage to players and mobs in the same block space where they land. The damage is dealt only on landing, and is not dealt to players and mobs that collide with them in mid-air. A falling block that deals damage can be [[summon]]ed if its <code>HurtEntities</code> tag is set to <code>true</code>. The amount of damage dealt per block fallen can be customized via the <code>FallHurtAmount</code> tag, and the maximum damage dealt can be customized via the <code>FallHurtMax</code> tag.

*{{nbt|compound}} Dynamic block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/entity}}
** {{nbt|compound|BlockState}}: The falling block represented by this entity.
*** {{nbt|string|Name}}: The [[resource location]] of the block.
*** {{nbt|compound|Properties}}: Optional. The [[block states]] of the block.
**** {{nbt|string|''Name''}}: The block state name and its value.
** {{nbt|byte|CancelDrop}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block should be destroyed instead of placed after landing on a solid block. When true, the block is not dropped as an item, even if the <code>DropItem</code> tag is set to true. However, if the entity is deleted due to its <code>Time</code> value being too high, this tag is ignored and an item is dropped depending on the <code>DropItem</code> tag. <code>CancelDrop</code> defaults to 1 for falling [[suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]], and 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
** {{nbt|byte|DropItem}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should drop as an item when it breaks. Any block that does not have an item form ''with the same ID as the block'' does not drop even if this is set.
** {{nbt|float|FallHurtAmount}}: Multiplied by the <code>FallDistance</code> to calculate the amount of damage to inflict. By default this value is {{hp|2}} for anvils, and {{hp|6}} for pointed dripstone.
** {{nbt|int|FallHurtMax}}: The maximum hit points of damage to inflict on entities that intersect this falling block. For vanilla falling blocks, always {{hp|40}}.
** {{nbt|byte|HurtEntities}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block should hurt entities it falls on. Defaults to 1 for [[Anvil|anvils]] and [[Pointed Dripstone|pointed dripstone]] and to 0 for the other vanilla falling blocks and any summoned falling block.
** {{nbt|compound|TileEntityData}}: Optional. The tags of the block entity for this block.
** {{nbt|int|Time}}: The number of ticks the entity has existed. When <code>Time</code> goes above 600, or above 100 while the block is at Y=-64 or is outside building height, the entity is deleted.
