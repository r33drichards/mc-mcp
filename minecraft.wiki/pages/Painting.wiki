'''Paintings''' are decorative [[entities]] that hang on walls. They have many different variants with different sizes when placed, which are chosen based on both the available space and random chance.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
To remove a painting from a wall, a player can {{control|attack}} it, {{control|break}} one of its supporting blocks, or {{control|place}} a block on the front of it (the block is placed on the wall behind the painting rather than being placed 1 block off of the wall). A painting can also be broken by an [[explosion]]. A painting always drops as an item when broken.

A painting can also be broken by throwing a projectile at it. The projectile can be any projectile with knockback or that does damage:
* {{EntityLink|Arrow}} (it disappears upon hitting a painting)
* {{EntityLink|Egg}} 
* {{EntityLink|Ender Pearl}}
* {{EntityLink|Fireball}}
* {{EntityLink|Llama Spit}}
* {{EntityLink|Shulker Bullet}}
* {{EntityLink|Small Fireball}}
* {{EntityLink|Snowball}}
* {{EntityLink|Trident}}
* {{EntityLink|Wind Charge}}
* {{EntityLink|Wither Skull|link=Wither#Wither Skull}}
* {{EntityLink|Fishing Bobber}}

=== Crafting ===

Paintings can be crafted with any color of [[wool]]. The color of the wool used does not influence the picture chosen when the painting is placed.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
[[File:All-paintings-1-21.png|thumb|360px|All paintings as of [[Java Edition 1.21.7]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.90]]. Note that the 2 &times; 2 paintings in the bottom right corner are only obtainable via [[commands]] and [[Creative inventory]].]]
Paintings can be placed on the sides of blocks that have the "[[legacy solid]]" [[block properties|property]] (this generally includes most fully or partially solid blocks, as well as some non-solid blocks such as [[sign]]s, [[banner]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, [[bamboo shoot]]s, and [[sculk vein]]s). They can also be placed on the sides of [[redstone repeater]]s and [[comparator]]s, despite them not being legacy solid.

Being an entity, paintings can simultaneously exist in the same space as blocks such as water or torches. Specifically, a painting can share the space with any block whose collision box does not intersect its hitbox. Paintings, however, cannot intersect other paintings or [[item frame]]s. Being an entity, paintings can be broken in adventure mode.

There are several different sizes of paintings, listed [[#Canvases|below]]. When placed, a painting checks for the amount of space it has around its center point. It then chooses a random canvas of the maximum size allowed in the available space. By arranging blocks on the wall, the player can ensure the painting is the size wanted.

A painting cannot cover an empty gap in a wall. When one of the supporting blocks is removed, the painting breaks after 20 game [[tick]]s (1 second), if no supporting blocks are replaced during that interval.

==== Preset paintings ====
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
{{IN|java}}, preset painting items are available in the "Functional Blocks" tab of the [[Creative inventory]]. The name, size, and author of the painting are displayed in the item tooltip. The "Operator Utilities" tab, if enabled, also contains the four [[#Unused paintings|unused elemental paintings]]. Unlike the regular painting item, these always place the same canvas.

=== Properties ===
Players and mobs are able to walk through paintings, as long as the blocks supporting the painting allow it (signs, open doors, etc). Secret doorways can be created this way. As mobs can pathfind through paintings, secret doorways are ineffective against them.

Paintings are non-flammable and allow [[light]] to propagate through them.

All paintings have MERS textures used in [[Vibrant Visuals]], used to define how light reflects on the texture. Only the roughness channel varies per pixel, all other channels are set to 0, except for ''Dennis'' which has different metalness and subsurface scattering values. For these textures, see [[List of painting textures]].

== Canvases ==
{{Redirect|Painting variant|the definition of painting variants in data packs|Painting variant definition}}
There are 47 paintings in the game. 40 of the paintings were made by [[Kristoffer Zetterstrand]], six were made by [[Sarah Boeving]], and one was made by [[Jens Bergensten]].

* The texture on the back of a painting is the same as the wooden planks texture, but with a yellowish color similar to that of [[chests]] (but slightly darker).
* The "Skull on Fire" painting contains a Minecraft world in the background, which is based on a screenshot taken by the artist in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2 01|Alpha 1.1.2_01]] (or earlier) on October 12, 2010, at 13:22:49 (UTC+2).<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928041338/https://imgur.com/HVhrbnH|title=The original (never publicly shared before) screenshot that Kristoffer Zetterstrand took and based his painting on.|website=Imgur}}</ref>
** The seeds for this world are -1044887956651363087 and -6984854390176336655 (both are the same), standing at X=-249.65, Y=91, Z=-29.04.<ref>https://pastebin.com/fzAY9ES4</ref><ref>{{reddit|iqg3ey||The original screenshot & seed of the Minecraft "Skull on Fire" painting has been found! <nowiki>[Minecraft@Home]</nowiki>|Tomlacko|September 10, 2020}}</ref>
* The "Skull on Fire" painting's texture was added in [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]]. However, the code for paintings to randomly display the part of the [[Kz.png]] texture that was to be occupied by the Burning Skull painting was added earlier, in [[Java Edition Beta 1.2_01|Beta 1.2_01]]. As there was nothing on this part of the texture except for a purple background grid, this is what would be displayed if the painting was randomly chosen, until the Burning Skull painting texture was actually added.
* The original "Skull on Fire" painting was given to Wojciech Mroczek, the winner of an official texture pack competition by Mojang.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110110003612/http://www.webhallen.com:80/minecraft/</ref><ref>https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/pixeludi-pack-texture-pack-compo-winner/</ref>
* The "Wither" painting was the first painting to be painted by someone other than Kristoffer Zetterstrand, instead being made by Jens Bergensten.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK5Y4k-vVXc|title=Who Made Minecraft’s (Formerly) LAST Painting?!|author=AntVenom|website=YouTube|date=29 October 2022}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{citation|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1tzav2/comment/cedagcy/|title=Here's some trivia for you...<br /><br />Since the paintings in Minecraft are down-scaled versions of real-life ones, (such as the one on topic, http://zetterstrand.com/work/pictures/2008/pointer750.jpg ), they have anti-aliased edges and more color gradients compared to other Minecraft art assets (blocks and items). So when I added the "Wither painting" (which isn't based on a real painting) I had to draw it using a soft brush tool instead of a hard pencil tool, to get the same visual effect. Obviously it doesn't compare to Zetterstrand's work, but... it's trivia.|website=Reddit|author=jeb_|date=December 30, 2013}}</ref>
* For Minecraft's 15th birthday, 25 new paintings were added to the game. Of those, 15 were created by the original painting artist Kristoffer Zetterstrand.<ref name="fifteenthanniversary">{{tweet|Minecraft|1785331050622640201|Minecraft is turning 15 this year, and to celebrate, we’re adding 15 new paintings!<br /><br />Coming to testing soon 🖼️|April 30, 2024}}</ref>
* The "Unpacked" painting's pig was scaled up by Sarah Boeving in order for it to pop out in the painting. <ref name=":2">{{ytl|x5roenGT1QI|THE ART OF MINECRAFT @ 4:10|Minecraft|July 13, 2024|t=250}}</ref>
