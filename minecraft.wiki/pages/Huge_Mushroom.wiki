'''Huge mushrooms''' are tree-like [[feature]]s that consist of [[mushroom block]]s. They can be found naturally in [[swamp]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, [[dark forest]], and [[mushroom fields]] biomes, or grown from a small [[mushroom]] by applying [[bone meal]] on it – small mushrooms do not turn into huge mushrooms naturally.

== Generation ==
Huge mushrooms naturally generate in [[swamp]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, [[dark forest]], and [[mushroom fields]] biomes.

== Growth ==
Huge mushrooms have a 40% chance to be grown by applying [[bone meal]] to a small red or brown [[mushroom]] that is planted on [[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]], or [[pale moss block]] with a sky and block [[light level]] of 12 or less, or on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]] or [[nylium]] at any light level. A minimum of 5 blocks above the mushroom must be free of solid blocks, although 7 blocks are necessary for most to spawn. 13 blocks are required for it to be possible to generate all types of huge mushrooms. Extra tall huge mushrooms have a ~5% chance of growing.

A huge mushroom does not grow above the height limit.

Any small mushroom placed does not grow into a huge mushroom naturally; bone meal must be applied.

== Construction ==
{{main|/Structure}}

A huge mushroom's height is normally between 5 and 7 [[block]]s inclusive, but have a {{frac|1|12}} chance to generate twice as high (minus 1 block), meaning they can be 9, 11, or 13 blocks tall.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/288c1n/are_there_supposed_to_be_super_tall_mushrooms/</ref>

[[File:Huge Brown Mushroom.png|thumb|upright|A huge brown mushroom]]
[[File:Huge Red Mushroom.png|thumb|upright|A huge red mushroom]]
To grow, the block under the huge mushroom's stem must be [[dirt]], [[podzol]], or [[mycelium]]. Light level does not matter if placed on [[podzol]] or [[mycelium]], but if placed on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]] or [[grass blocks]] both skylight and blocklight must be 12 or less. Each type of mushroom also has its own space requirements, which are described below.

=== Huge brown mushrooms ===
Huge brown mushrooms consist of a single stalk in the center, with a 7×7 canopy of brown mushroom blocks at the top with the corners missing. 

For the mushroom to grow, the lowest four blocks of the stem (i.e. the three blocks above the small mushroom being grown) must be air or leaves, and a 7×(height−3)×7 region above must similarly be clear of anything except air or leaves. Due to the space requirement matching the size of the canopy at the top, it is possible for a huge brown mushroom to grow with its canopy directly touching a mushroom next to it.

=== Huge red mushrooms ===
Huge red mushrooms, like their brown counterparts, have a single stalk in the center, but a different canopy, composed of five 3×3 slabs of red mushroom blocks arranged above and around the stalk, forming a 'dome'. Unlike brown mushrooms, red mushrooms only check the blocks directly above the small mushroom, and do not require the rest of the dome to be clear of other blocks. Blocks that mobs can't suffocate in, such as slabs, end portal frame and end portal, are replaced; full blocks remain unchanged.

=== Development ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine||June 14, 2011|link={{tweet|notch|80654817512525825}}|Notch showed a picture of a Beta 1.7 change-list. Although it was completely blurred out and was at first thought of as a joke, Notch later stated that one of the pictures with the new lighting system and the change list had a secret in them.
|One place where people discussed it was on the [http://www.minecraftforum.net Minecraft Forums], where it was discovered that the tabs at the top of the change list, which were partly covered, could be decoded based on the one pixel tall pattern available in the image.<ref>http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/379958-</ref>
|After a user named "tmcaffeine" successfully decoded the image, the tabs read: ExperienceOrb.java, changelist.txt, Level.java, Tile.java, HugeMushroomTile.jav(a?), '''HugeMushroomFeature'''.(java?), RandomLevelSource(cut).<ref>http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/380498-</ref>
|This led people to believe that huge mushrooms would be added, and indeed, later on Notch revealed a screenshot on Google+ in which two huge mushrooms could be seen as well as a [[village]].}}

==Issues==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* All huge mushrooms have exactly 45 blocks besides the stalk, so an average of 13.5 mushrooms can be obtained from each huge mushroom's cap.
* Red mushrooms are rarer than brown mushrooms, but this is not the case for huge mushrooms.
