'''v0.7.4 alpha''' is a minor update to ''[[Pocket Edition|Minecraft: Pocket Edition]]'' released on August 31, 2013 for Fire and on September 2, 2013 for Android and iOS. It fixes some of the bugs and crashes in [[Pocket Edition v0.7.3 alpha|v0.7.3]].

== Additions ==

=== Gameplay ===
* Added an "External" button in the edit section of world create menu, for IP-connecting to servers.
* Added a very faint sound when tools break, as well as a sound when [[flint and steel]] is used.
* Tapping and holding flint and steel on a [[creeper]] will cause the creeper to start explosion countdown.
* The [[splash]] now changes every time a world is quit, fixing {{bug|MCPE-4926}}.
* Added support for [[commands]], however no commands have been implemented yet.
* Added [[chiseled quartz block]] to survival mode.
* The [[moon]] now has different phases.

== Changes ==

=== General ===
* Clouds are now slightly darker, to correspond to the cloud color in Java Edition.
* The orbit size of the sun and moon around the player has been increased, fixing a sun and moon size problem, as well as the sun appearing in front of the clouds.
* After eating [[food]], a burp can be heard.
* [[Egg]]s can be thrown rapidly if the [[player]] keeps on tapping and holding the screen in both creative and survival.
* Each message displayed by the server now has a tag (e.g. 'Disconnected from server' now reads '<error> Disconnected from server').

=== Blocks and Items ===
* [[Fire]] now has idle sounds when the player is within proximity.
* Flint and steel now produces sound when used.
* [[Lava buckets]] can now be used as furnace fuel, smelting up to 100 items.
