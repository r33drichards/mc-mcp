'''Interaction range''' (also known as '''reach''') is the maximum distance a [[player]] can interact with a [[block]] or [[entity]] and perform an action. The default interaction range varies by situation.

When within the reach distance, targeted blocks are highlighted. {{IN|java}}, this manifests as an [[interaction box]] wireframe around the block, while {{in|bedrock}}, it can be customized through the "Outline Selection" option in video settings. Disabling this feature replaces the wireframe with a white highlight.

== ''Java Edition'' ==

{{IN|je}}, there are two types of interaction range, [[block]] interaction range (breaking reach) and [[entity]] interaction range (attack range), which are respectively controlled by two [[attribute]]s, <code>block_interaction_range</code> and <code>entity_interaction_range</code>. The default entity interaction range is 3 blocks in all other game modes and 5 blocks in [[Creative]] mode. The default block interaction range is 4.5 blocks in all other game modes and 5 blocks in Creative mode. The bonus effect in Creative mode is implemented via an [[Attribute#Modifiers|attribute modifier]].

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
{{IN|bedrock}}, the default interaction range is 5 blocks for keyboard, mouse, or controller inputs. For players using touch input, the reach extends to 12 blocks in Creative mode and 6 blocks in other modes.
