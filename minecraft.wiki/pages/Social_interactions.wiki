[[File:Social Interactions Screen.png|thumb|The Social Interactions screen]]
The '''Social Interactions''' screen is a graphical interface used to disable chatting with certain [[player]]s, and report players for messages, skins, usernames, or screenshots that go against the [https://www.minecraft.net/community-standards Minecraft Community Standards].

== Usage ==
{{Expand section}}
By default, the Social Interactions screen is opened by pressing {{keys|P}} on the keyboard. It can also be opened by clicking on the "Player Reporting" button on the pause menu in multiplayer games. The "All" tab lists all players who have joined the server, the "Hidden" tab shows players whose chat messages are hidden, and the "Blocked" tab shows players blocked using their [[Microsoft]] account. Attempting to open the screen in a [[Singleplayer]] world displays the message "Social Interactions are only available in [[multiplayer]] worlds".

== Player reporting ==
[[File:Account permanently banned.png|thumb|The screen seen if the player’s account has been permanently banned online.]]
[[Player]]s' skins, usernames, chat messages, screenshots, or Realms Stories posts may be reported to [[Mojang Studios]] by other players. All player reports are manually reviewed with the given context by Mojang staff.

Potential outcomes for a player report are as follows:<ref name=":0">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/7149823936781-Player-Reporting-in-Minecraft-Java-Edition#h_01GD13PG9R60SYNDV88FKFSHRH</ref>

* No action taken.
* Temporary, or permanent bans from online play.
* Banning the use of a reported skin.
* Banning the use of a reported username.

In the event of a banned skin, the player and any other players with the banned skin have theirs reset to a default skin.<ref name=":0" /> In the event of a banned username, the player with the banned username is temporarily suspended from online play until the username is changed.<ref name=":0" />

Most public third-party servers do not have in-game player reporting enabled due to technical reasons from the server software used (or disable it actively). However, the officially supported server hosting platform, [[Realms|Minecraft Realms]], has this feature fully enabled and functional, with no way to disable it.
