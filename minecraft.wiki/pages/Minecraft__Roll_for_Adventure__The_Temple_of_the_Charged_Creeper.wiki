== Summary ==
{{Quote|'''Roll the dice to create your very own [[Minecraft]] story in this tabletop game—with dice, instructions, and an adventure book!'''

When a [[village]] is raided by [[illager]]s, its poor [[villager|inhabitants]] seek the aid of a mighty [[hero]] to track down the invaders. They need someone brave, clever, and determined. They need you!

Make crucial decisions, craft powerful items, roll dice to battle mobs, and explore the [[Overworld]] on your epic journey to discover and destroy the mysterious [[Temple of the Charged Creeper]]. This book contains:

* A complete adventure book with a bestiary of wicked mobs and a collection of perilous adventure locations.
* Four dice to help—or hurt—you as you battle mysterious foes.
* A removable character sheet and rules reference to help you track your heroic progress (or to let you play with a friend as your narrator!).

So sharpen your [[sword]], prepare your [[pickaxe]], and grab your green dice. Your epic Minecraft adventure begins now!|Game description}}
