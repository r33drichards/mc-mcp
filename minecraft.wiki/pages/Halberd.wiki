A {{JP|'''Halberd'''|ハルバード|Harubādo|lead=yes}} is a large bladed polearm, consisting of an axe blade topped with a sword blade. They can be created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
Halberds are extremely long weapons, towering over [[Nico White]]. The majority of this length is taken up by the handle, a long stick, which the primary combat portion of the halberd is attached to. This takes the form of an axe blade, with sword blades sticking out of its back and top.

== Functionality ==
As a polearm, halberds can be used for close- and medium-range combat.
