'''21w03a''' is the sixth snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on January 20, 2021, which adds [[glow squid]], [[glow ink sac]]s, [[glow lichen]], [[glow item frame]]s, and fixes bugs.<ref>{{snap|21w03a|January 20, 2021}}</ref> This is the first snapshot released in 2021.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Glow Item Frame JE1 BE3.png|32px]] [[Glow item frame]]s'''
* Placeable entities which appear to glow.
* Do not affect the light level, only appearing as if lit up themselves.
* Items placed inside also glow.
* Crafted using an [[item frame]] and a glow ink sac.
* Includes application to [[map]]s.

'''[[File:Glow Lichen (texture) JE1.png|32px]] [[Glow lichen]]'''
* A naturally occurring light source found rarely in caves, growing on any face of a block.
* Has a light level of 7.
* Obtained with [[shears]], otherwise breaks.
* Does not spread naturally, although [[bone meal]] can be used to spread it.
** It spreads to adjacent spaces horizontally, up to 4.
* Can be waterlogged.
* Unlike [[vines]], it does not pop off when underwater, and is not climbable.
* Up to 6 can be put on the same block space, merging into one block.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Glow Ink Sac JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Glow ink sac]]s'''
* Dropped by glow squid when killed.
* Can be used to craft glow item frames.
* Can be used to make text glow on [[sign]]s.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Glow Squid Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Glow squid spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Glow Squid JE1.gif|32px]] [[Glow squid]]'''
* Originates from the mob with [[MCE:Glow Squid|the same name]] from ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.
* Underwater mob that behaves like a regular [[squid]].
* Does not naturally spawn yet.
* Is attacked by [[axolotl]]s without provocation.
* Drops glow ink sacs when killed.
* Does not affect the light level, only appearing as if lit up itself.
* Stops glowing for a short time and swims away fast after taking damage.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dripstone block]]s'''
* Can now be crafted from 4 [[pointed dripstone]].

'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Can now be tinted with glow ink sacs to make the text glow.
** Glowing signs do not affect the light level, only appearing as if the text itself is illuminated.
** A new <code>lit</code> [[block state]] had been added to indicate whether the sign text is lit up.
** Regular [[ink sac]]s can be used to remove the glowing effect.
** Now has sounds for being dyed.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Added unique death messages for dying from falling on a stalagmite.
** "<player> was impaled on a stalagmite" and "<player> was impaled on a stalagmite whilst fighting <entity>".
** Previously, this death would use the generic fall damage death messages.

'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* The [[chiseled polished blackstone]] crafting recipe is now unlocked by having a [[polished blackstone slab]], instead of polished blackstone.

'''[[Subtitle]]s'''
* Changed <code>Lava drips into cauldron</code> to <code>Lava drips into Cauldron</code>.
* Changed <code>Water drips into cauldron</code> to <code>Water drips into Cauldron</code>.
* Changed <code>Shulker bullet explodes</code> to <code>Shulker Bullet explodes</code>.
* Changed <code>Shulker bullet breaks</code> to <code>Shulker Bullet breaks</code>.

=== General ===
'''Block models'''
* Made the vines block model much simpler.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Changed the error message for failing to connect to the authentication servers. Now says they are "not reachable" instead of "down for maintenance".

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added glow squid to the <code>axolotl_always_hostiles</code> entity type tag.

'''[[Obfuscation map]]'''
* Changed the license included in the obfuscation map.

'''World selection'''
* Added unique warnings for downgrading a world.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Removed the following languages due to incomplete translations:
** Gothic
** Kabyle
** Maori
** Mohawk
** Nuk
** Ojibwe
** Talossan

'''[[Custom|Customized world]]'''
* World height/depth can now be adjusted to a max of Y=-2048 to Y=2031, mountain and cave generation scales accordingly similar to amplified world type.<ref>https://youtu.be/9WpkDr1gXq8</ref><ref>https://youtu.be/tH76tx-AnWI</ref>
