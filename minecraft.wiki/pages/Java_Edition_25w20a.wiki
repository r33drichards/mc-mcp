** Has a [[comparator]] output of 10 when played in a [[jukebox]].

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|dialog}}'''
* A new command that shows dialog to clients.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|dialog show <targets> <dialog>}}
*** Show dialog to player(s).
*** {{cd|<targets>}} - player name, UUID or a player selector.
*** {{cd|<dialog>}} - a namespaced ID from {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry or inline dialog value as described above.
*** Returns number of players in targets argument.
** {{cmd|dialog clear <targets>}}
*** Clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible.
*** {{cd|<targets>}} - player name, UUID or a player selector.
*** Returns number of players in targets argument.

** "[[Lilypad (song)|Lilypad]]"
** "[[O's Piano]]"
* The same songs have been added to the [[menu screen]] music rotation.

=== General ===
'''[[Dialog]]s'''
* Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user.
* Dialogs are stored in a {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry, but can also be defined inline
* Dialogs are an experimental feature.
* To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title.
** Clicking on this warning leads to a dialog that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content.
** It also gives user an option to leave current world to avoid them being locked in infinite loop of dialogs.
* Dialogs can be displayed by server in {{cd|play}} and {{cd|configuration}} connection phases.
** However, only inline registries are allowed in {{cd|configuration}}, since registries are not yet available in that phase.
* Dialogs always close after user selects any action.
* Dialogs by default will also close after {{key|Escape}} key is pressed.
** When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below.
** This behavior is configurable.
* When dialog screen is closed, game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay.
** That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any.
* Dialogs screens will pause the game in singleplayer mode.
* Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu.
** This replaces and expands "Server Links" button added in previous versions.
* Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
** Header with title and warning button.
** Body elements (labels, inputs, buttons and submit actions), scrollable if needed.
** Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions.
