'''Granite''' is a [[block]] of igneous [[rock]], found in [[ore (feature)|large pockets]] underground.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Granite can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Granite|Pickaxe|Wood|link=none}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
Granite can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[ore (feature)|ores]]. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, granite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generates 2 times per chunk in ores of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has 1⁄6 chance to generate ores of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. {{IN|BE}}, granite can replace stone, andesite, diorite, polished andesite, polished diorite, and polished granite. {{IN|JE}}, granite can replace stone, andesite, diorite, tuff, and deepslate.

In addition, granite generates as part of large copper [[ore veins]], [[coral reef]]s{{only|be}}, and in [[Village#Desert|desert village]] armorer houses.

== Usage ==
Granite has the same [[Explosion#Blast resistance|blast resistance]] as [[ston]]e, meaning it can be used as a substitute for stone when building.

== Trivia ==
* {{w|Granite}} rock comes from underground {{w|magma chamber}}s that turned cold. It is often pinkish in color because of its {{w|alkali feldspar}} minerals.
** {{w|Diorite}} is another magma chamber rock, but it has less {{w|quartz}} in it than granite. This is in accordance with granite's crafting recipe in ''[[Minecraft]]'', which consists of nether quartz with diorite.
