'''Jens "Jeb" Bergensten''' is the Chief Creative Officer<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/credits</ref> at [[Mojang Studios]].

== About ==
Jeb joined Mojang on December 1, 2010, as a game developer.<ref name="intro">{{Tumblr|notch|1619018018|Introducing: Jens!|November 19, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140706/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1619018018/introducing-jens}}</ref> Starting out as a back-end developer for ''[[Scrolls]]'', Jeb became increasingly involved in the development of ''Minecraft'', implementing features like [[wolves]], [[piston]]s, and map structures ([[village]]s, [[stronghold]]s and [[nether fortress]]es). Jeb later took the lead position in ''Minecraft'' development in December 2011 when [[Markus Persson]] stepped down.<ref>{{Tumblr|notch|13633493969|Och med dom orden så passar jag micken.|December 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202205113/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/13633493969/och-med-dom-orden-sa-passar-jag-micken}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|142605178762305536|As of yesterday, @jeb_ is the lead developer on Minecraft!<br>http://notch.tumblr.com}}</ref> On December 12, 2012, he announced that he would also take the lead of ''[[Pocket Edition]]''.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|278859663095779328|As of today I will take the lead role for Minecraft: Pocket Edition, as well as the PC version.

In April 2013, Jens together with Markus Persson were included the annual ''{{Wikipedia|Time (magazine)|TIME}}'' 100 listicle of the most influential people in the world.<ref>http://time100.time.com/2013/04/18/time-100/slide/markus-persson-and-jens-bergensten</ref>

== Quotes ==
{{Q|'''Jeb, you've added a lot of things to Minecraft — which one is your favorite?'''<br><br>The random structures, like [[stronghold]]s and [[Nether fortresses]]. It was challenging to do — when they're generated, the game doesn't know what the terrain looks like. The game has to make a lot of assumptions, which may result in [[village]]s with [[ravine]]s running through them, or villages that are half-submerged in [[water]].|Jeb in ''[[Minecraft: Essential Handbook]]''||Jeb twitter 2010 to 2016.jpg}}{{Q|I think Minecraft unleashes people's creativity and helps them collaborate, but also teaches them things like geometry, languages and maths, so yes, I do think that the world would be a better place if everyone played Minecraft.|Jeb at [[Minecraft Live 2020]]||Mojavatar Jens 200x296.png}}
