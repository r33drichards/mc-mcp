'''Mycelium''' is a particularly rare variant of [[dirt]] that is only found naturally in [[mushroom fields]] biomes. It has a particle effect that resembles tiny [[wikipedia:Spore|spores]] being released constantly from the surface.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Mycelium can be obtained by mining it using a tool with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment. If mined with any other tool or by hand, it drops [[dirt]]. A [[shovel]] is the fastest tool to collect it.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Mycelium|drop=0|shovel}}

=== Natural generation ===
Mycelium generates in [[mushroom fields]] biomes in abundance.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Endermen]] can pick up mycelium blocks, and drop the block they are holding if killed.

== Usage ==
=== Spread ===
Mycelium can spread to any [[dirt]] block within one space above, one sideways, or three down. Mycelium needs at least [[light level]] 9 above it, while dirt needs at least light level 4 above it and must not be covered by any light-impeding block or any [[opaque]] block. Mycelium reverts to dirt when covered by a light-impeding block above, and the light level at that block is below 4. The death and spread behaviors are checked when a [[random tick]] lands on the block.

If there is a plant on a dirt block when mycelium spreads to it, the plant pops out and drops as an item.

=== Dirt path ===
Mycelium can be turned into a [[dirt path]] by {{control|using}} any type of [[shovel]] on it.

=== Effect on plants and mobs ===
* [[Mushroom]]s and [[Nether Fungus|Nether fungi]] can remain on mycelium blocks in any light level, unlike the situation on other blocks, where mushrooms are broken (dropping as items) during block updates in high light.
* [[Huge mushroom]]s can grow on mycelium, just as they can grow on [[dirt]], [[grass block]]s, or [[podzol]].
* Mycelium cannot be directly tilled with a [[hoe]] to make [[farmland]].<ref>{{bug|MC-8231||Mycelium and podzol cannot be tilled with hoes}}</ref>
** However, it can first be converted to dirt path using a shovel, then tilled with a hoe to create farmland.
* [[Sniffer]]s cannot dig on mycelium.<ref>{{bug|MC-260259||Sniffers cannot dig nor find seeds on mycelium|WAI}}</ref>

=== Death ===
Mycelium dies and changes to [[dirt]] a random time (when a [[random tick]] lands on the block) after it has been covered by any [[opaque]] blocks. Transparent blocks can kill mycelium in a similar manner if they cause the light level above the mycelium to be four or below (like water does) and the surrounding area is not otherwise sufficiently illuminated.

== Trivia ==
* In real life, {{W|mycelium|newtab=1}} is the part of a {{W|fungus|newtab=1}} that gathers nutrients. Mycelium consists of web-like threads known as {{W|hyphae|newtab=1}}. Mycelium can be considered the roots of a fungus, whereas the mushrooms can be considered the fruits. Mycelium itself does not produce spores, although its particle effect in ''Minecraft'' may look like spores.
