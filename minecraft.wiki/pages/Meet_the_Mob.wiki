{{Quote|A chilling sound rings out across the world and all its dimensions. The sky darkens. Somewhere, someone has done something either very brave or very foolish: they’ve summoned a Wither.|Marsh Davies in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-wither Meet the Wither]}}

{{Quote|There you have it - a potential pig ended up becoming Minecraft's most iconic monster. So next time you're making a bacon sandwich, make sure to be extra careful to lay the bacon horizontally. Otherwise, who knows? Maybe you'll accidentally make a Creeper sandwich and then BLOW YOUR OWN MOUTH OFF.|Tom Stone in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-creeper Meet the Creeper]}}

{{Quote|“Oh what fun!” you say, upon seeing a tiny zombie riding an adorable chicken. “A tiny zombie riding an adorable chicken! I'm going to skip over and pet it. After all, what could possibly go wrong?”|Emily Richardson in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-chicken-jockey Meet the Chicken Jockey]}}

{{Quote|Covered in blue robes and accompanied by two llamas, the mysterious Wandering Trader is just what its name suggests – a travelling salesman, journeying the Overworld in search of customers willing to exchange their shiny emeralds for rare and exotic items.|Per Landin in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-wandering-trader Meet the Wandering Trader]}}
