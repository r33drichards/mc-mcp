== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[World options]]'''
* Level theme (normal, hell).
** Normal: The default map theme. The map's contents are based off the level type option. The weather is partly cloudy and [[tree]]s generate.
** Hell: Features significantly less lighting during the day. All surface water is replaced with lava. Mushrooms are abundant on the surface.{{verify|edition=java|type=untestable}} Surrounding water also becomes lava.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Deep floating maps now have layers of islands.
* Flowers no longer generate naturally.
* Fog is now darker in darker areas.<ref>{{link|https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/113579-map-modes?page=4|title=''I've noticed that fog color is now based on how dark your surroundings are. I didn't notice this in the earlier version, so I'm assuming this is new. It makes a cool eyes adjusting to the light effect when entering and leaving caves.''|author=MCFUser1359|website=Minecraft Forum|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref>
* Mipmapping is now enabled.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(13:55:53) <Notch> Oh, and that version up there has experimental mipmapping"</ref>

== Bugs ==
'''2 bugs reported'''
* [[Water]] texture is glitched by mipmapping.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: (13:58:31) <Notch> that water does look crap, yes"..."(14:12:36) <VurtualRuler98> Notch, is it mipmapping water?"..."(14:13:00) <VurtualRuler98>A small circle of water texture"..."(14:13:08) <VurtualRuler98> Then I see tiny blue dots, followed by tinier orange dots"..."(14:54:02) <Wirtualnosc> And about water outside and inside map, water boundaries look ugly :/"..."(14:54:05) <Quatroking> also there's still weird stuff in the water"</ref>
* Looking at [[Tree]]s and looking down on islands drop performance.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(14:01:09) <VurtualRuler98> I'm on an island, I get 3fps when looking down"..."(14:02:49) <Dilt> crowds of trees, i look at them and my FPS goes from managable 20 to like 5"</ref>
