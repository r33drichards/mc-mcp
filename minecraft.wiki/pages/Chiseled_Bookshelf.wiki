'''Chiseled bookshelves''' are [[block]]s that can hold [[book]]s, [[books and quills]], [[written book]]s, [[enchanted book]]s, and [[knowledge book]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Chiseled bookshelves can be destroyed with any [[tool]], but an [[axe]] mines it the fastest. When broken, all contained books are dropped as items. The block itself drops only when broken using a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]].<ref>{{bug|MC-261722||Chiseled bookshelf doesn't drop without using the silk touch enchantment|WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
Chiseled bookshelves cannot be moved by [[piston]]s.{{only|je}}

=== Holding books ===
[[File:Chiseled BookshelfTextures.png|thumb|All of the chiseled bookshelf textures before [[Java Edition 22w46a|22w46a]].]]
Chiseled bookshelves can hold up to six [[book]]s, [[books and quills]], [[written book]]s, [[enchanted book]]s, and/or [[knowledge book]]s. There is no GUI; books are instead added into the bookshelf by {{ctrl|using}} on a slot with a book. Doing so places a book in that slot. {{ctrl|Using}} on an occupied slot removes the book from that slot.

Chiseled bookshelves do not increase the power of [[enchanting table]]s.

=== Redstone signal ===
[[File:chiseled_bookshelf_power.png|thumb|100px|The correspondences between slot and signal power.]]
A [[redstone comparator]] sends a signal (1–6) indicating the last slot interacted with. When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0.

An [[observer]] can detect when a book is added or removed from the bookshelf.

=== Hoppers, minecarts with hoppers, and droppers ===
[[Hopper]]s and [[minecarts with hopper]]s can insert and remove books from the bookshelf. As with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot. [[Dropper]]s behave similarly when inserting books into the bookshelf.

When a hopper that is not already 100% full fails to remove a book from a non-empty bookshelf because there is no room for the book in the hopper's inventory, that is still counted as an "interaction" with the slot. Thus, a hopper that cannot remove any of the books effectively sets the last-interacted slot to the last non-empty slot in the bookshelf.<ref>{{bug|MC-257178||Chiseled Bookshelf redstone behavior is inconsistent|Fixed}}</ref>

=== Fuel ===
Chiseled bookshelves can be used as fuel in furnaces to smelt 1.5 items.

=== Note blocks ===
Chiseled bookshelves can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce a "bass" sound.
