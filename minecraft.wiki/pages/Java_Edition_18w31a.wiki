'''18w31a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13.1]], released on August 1, 2018,<ref name="18w31a">{{snap|18w31a|August 1, 2018}}</ref> which adds some new features, changes some existing features, optimizes performance, and fixes many bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''{{EnvLink|Chunks}}'''
* Added a concept of force-loaded chunks to the game, and a command ({{cmd|chunk}}) to toggle force-loading on and off.

'''Block [[tag]]s'''
* Added the tag <code>minecraft:underwater_bonemeals</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Conduit]]s'''
* Are now properly waterlogged.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Fish]]'''
* Now have a 5% chance of dropping bone meal when killed.

'''[[Squid]]'''
* Now spawn only in rivers, oceans, or beaches.

=== Items ===
'''[[Bone meal]]'''
* When used in water of warm ocean biomes, it now has a chance to grow [[coral]].

=== Command format ===
'''[[Scoreboard]]s'''
* The [[Scoreboard#Players commands|scoreboard operator]] <code>%=</code> was changed from using Java's native <code>%</code> to using <code>Math.floorMod</code>. This causes the operator to use floored [[wikipedia:modulo|modulo]] instead of truncated modulo, so now <code>-1 % 7</code> wraps to 6 instead of returning -1.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/93pmai/minecraft_snapshot_18w31a/e3fkwrj</ref>

'''Functions'''
* Line numbers in function parse error logs now start with 1 (was 0).

=== General ===
* Performance has been optimized.
