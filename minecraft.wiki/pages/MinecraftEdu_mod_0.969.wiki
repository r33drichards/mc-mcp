It is based on [[Java Edition Beta 1.8.1]],<ref>[[MinecraftEdu mod 0.969#logs|MinecraftEdu Logs]]: "''<@kulttuuri> We will try to aim next release to be also available for individuals, so that has taken some time from us (had to develop separate mod install tool and such for it), but now we are mostly just waiting for the bugfixes for 1.0 and next release that could be merged into Edu!''" (November 22, 2011)</ref> which adds the [[logo]] for the game, a new [[block]], minor changes, and gameplay news.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Spawn Block.png|width=32x32]] [[Spawn Block]]'''
* Would update the world spawn point to that location. If a spawn block already existed in the world, the spawn point would always be overwritten in favor of the newest block.
** Spawn points set by the spawn block behaved identically to world spawn points set using commands.
** Student players also had the ability to teleport themselves to the current spawn block from their student menu.

=== General ===
'''Title screen'''
* Added logo: [[File:MinecraftEdu logo 1.png|width=133x133]]
** The logo doesn't have any [[splashes]].

=== Gameplay ===
* User transfer panel.

=== Other ===
* Game server menu.

* The student outfit image no longer has a blue background, an arrow was added to the "Cancel" button, and the tab that is currently selected is now black instead of gray.
