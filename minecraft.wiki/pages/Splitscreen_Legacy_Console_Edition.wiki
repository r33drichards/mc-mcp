'''Splitscreen''' is a console-exclusive feature that allows up to four players to play on one screen at the same time. It is supported in the [[Legacy Console Edition]] (excluding [[PlayStation Vita Edition|PS Vita]]) on [[mini games]] and {{w|peer-to-peer}} online multiplayer. 

== Gameplay ==

Splitscreen requires a screen with an output of at least 720p or higher. On television screens, this can be achieved using either an [[Wikipedia:HDMI|HDMI]] or [[Wikipedia:Component video#RGB analog component video|RGB component cable]].

Splitscreen can be activated by connecting additional [[Controller|game controllers]], up to 4 players can play in splitscreen at the same time. In order to trigger splitscreen, the second party must press the Start button ({{xbtn|360start}} on Xbox 360 or {{psbtn|3start}} on PlayStation 3) on their controller, and then select a user profile in the console where their progress is saved, whether locally or online. {{only|Xbox 360}}

The game splits the screen into multiple segments, with each segment being controlled by a player and showing their camera perspective. Each segment also shows the player's [[username]] on the top right screen. For two player splitscreen, a "2 Player Split-Screen Vertical" option can be enabled in the settings to split the screen vertically. Splitscreen essentially enables a [[multiplayer]] game for a [[singleplayer]] [[world]], where players can work together to reach certain objectives. Note that the [[render distance]] decreases with every additional player joining the multiplayer game.

In three player splitscreen, the screen layout is split into four segments, in which the fourth segment is blank.

Splitscreen can be played on online multiplayer games, such as [[mini games]] and worlds with "Online game" enabled. However, on Xbox 360, this requires all players to have an {{w|Xbox Live Gold}} subscription (now called Xbox Game Pass Core, Standard, and Ultimate), otherwise, they are not able to play together. Alternatively, players can play on a guest account for online splitscreen, however they must be signed in from the start. On PlayStation 3, online splitscreen is free and does not require a subscription.

Local splitscreen is separate, being offline and thus not requiring an Xbox Live Gold subscription.

=== Console support ===

Because of the resolution requirement, splitscreen cannot be played through {{w|Off-TV Play}} on the {{w|Wii U GamePad}} in the ''[[Wii U Edition]]''. However, the ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' supported splitscreen even without a TV, purely because its screen has a higher resolution of 720p over the Wii U Gamepad's 480p screen.

The ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'' is the only version of the Legacy Console Edition that does not support splitscreen. This is because the Vita's native resolution is too low, and because it's a single player handheld system.
