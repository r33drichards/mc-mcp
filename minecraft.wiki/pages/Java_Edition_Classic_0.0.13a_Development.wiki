* '''Additions'''
** Added a thin black block selection outline.
** Pressing Esc now opens the pause menu, with options to return to game, generate a new level and save/load level, the last of which doesn't do anything. 
* '''Changes'''
** Changed the game's resolution from 640×480 to 854×480.
** The block being used is once again shown in the top right corner.
** Made swimming and sinking faster than before. 
** Holding the {{ctrl|jump}} key no longer allows for autojumping.
** Jump height reduced back to just over 1 block instead of just over 1.5 blocks.
** This is the earliest version in the launcher where holding down <kbd>R</kbd> no longer causes the player to cycle between different locations - holding the key now has the same effect as simply pressing it.
** Lava is no longer transparent and has a thick, red mist when underneath it.
** Changed the texture of saplings from [[File:Oak Sapling JE1.png|32px]] to [[File:Oak Sapling JE2.png|32px]]
** The generated world is now completely flat. When generating a new level from the pause menu, the world is of a long shape (32×64×512), but still flat. It is worth noting that caves can still generate in these worlds.
* '''Trivia'''
** This is the version available in the launcher, added to it among several other versions on August 6, 2013.
** This is the only 0.0.13a developer build that is available in the launcher.

== World size test (2) (May 21, 2009) ==
{{Unreleased version|section=1}}
* '''Changes'''
** The world is now 1024×64×64 instead of 512×64×32 in size, and generates actual terrain.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(10:48:56) Notch_: and I just tried making a 1024x64x64 map. It's nuts [...] (10:49:06) Notch_: it's basically a looong gauntlet of hills and lakes"</ref>
** Terrain has been updated to the 0.0.13a_03 format.
** Dirt layer is now more uniform.
*** There is always a single block of dirt after grass and before stone.
** If water generates next to lava on world generation, it now produces stone.
* '''Trivia'''
** It is very likely this version has the new level generation screen, however this is not confirmed.
