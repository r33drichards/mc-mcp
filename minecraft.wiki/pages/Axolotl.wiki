An '''axolotl''' is a passive aquatic [[mob]] found in [[lush caves]] that hunts most other aquatic mobs, and can assist [[player]]s with aquatic combat and grant them [[Regeneration]]. They can also be carried around in a [[bucket]].

== Spawning ==
Axolotls [[Mob spawning|spawn]] underwater in the [[lush caves]] biome and when there is a [[clay block]] less than five blocks below the spawning space.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Colors ===
Axolotls can be one of five colors: pink (leucistic), brown (wild), gold, cyan and blue. 

When breeding axolotls, there is a {{frac|1|1200}} (0.083%) chance of the offspring having the blue mutation, leaving {{frac|1199|1200}} (99.917%) chance of matching one of the parents (including blue parents).

Blue axolotls cannot naturally spawn and can only be obtained through breeding.

== Drops ==
Axolotls drop nothing when killed besides 1 [[experience]] when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Axolotls are passive toward players, can be attached to [[lead]]s, and follow players holding a [[bucket of tropical fish]] on either the main hand or the off-hand. When a player kills a mob that is in combat with one or more axolotls, axolotls remove [[Mining Fatigue]] from the player, and give the player [[Regeneration]] I for {{convert|100|tick|second}} per axolotl in the fight, up to a duration of {{convert|2400|tick|minute}} {{in|java}}, and uncapped {{in|bedrock}}.

Axolotls attack the following mobs, dealing {{hp|2}} points of damage per attack:
{{columns-list|
* {{EntityLink|Cod}}
* {{EntityLink|Drowned}}
* {{EntityLink|Elder Guardian}}
* {{EntityLink|Glow Squid}}
* {{EntityLink|Guardian}}
* {{EntityLink|Pufferfish}}
* {{EntityLink|Salmon}}
* {{EntityLink|Squid}}
* {{EntityLink|Tadpole}}
* {{EntityLink|Tropical Fish}}
}}

After killing a non-hostile mob, there is a two minute cooldown before another non-hostile mob can be hunted. Axolotls prioritize attacking hostile mobs over non-hostile mobs.

If an axolotl takes damage underwater, it may play dead, dropping to the ground for {{convert|200|tick|second}} while gaining Regeneration I. Hostile aquatic mobs ignore healing axolotls. There is a {{frac|1|3}} chance for an axolotl to play dead to recover {{hp|4}}. In addition, if either a random integer from 0–2 (inclusive) is less than the amount of incoming [[damage]], or the axolotl's health before the damage is dealt is less than 50% of its maximum health, it plays dead. 

Axolotls can leave the water and wander about on land. When an axolotl leaves the water, it wanders as far as 8 or 9 blocks beyond the water's edge before returning to the water, as long as there is water at least 2 blocks deep within 16 blocks of the axolotl. If 2-block-deep water is outside this range, the axolotl can wander off randomly on land in search of more deep water, and die after {{convert|6000|tick|minute}} exposure out of water. Axolotls are not attracted to shallow (1 block deep) water. They require water at least 2 blocks deep within 16 blocks to pathfind to the water.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-122278}}</ref>

Being hit with a splash water bottle or lingering water bottle will restore {{convert|1800|tick|second}} of air to the axolotl.

Axolotls can also die out of water as passengers in a boat. Unlike [[fish]] and [[squid]], axolotls do not die on land in [[rain]] or in a [[thunderstorm]].

Unlike most mobs, axolotls cannot be moved by flowing water. However, they are still affected by [[bubble column]]s.

As aquatic mobs, they take extra [[damage]] from the [[Impaling]] enchantment {{in|je}}. Unlike other aquatic mobs, they cause nearby [[pufferfish]] to inflate.

Axolotls picked up with a [[water bucket]] and re-spawned do not despawn.

Naming a [[bucket of axolotl]] in an [[anvil]] also sets the name of the axolotl inside{{only|je|short=1}}. The name remains with the axolotl if it is picked up by another bucket.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}

Axolotls follow players holding [[buckets of tropical fish]] within 10{{only|java|short=1}} / 16{{only|bedrock|short=1}} blocks. Additionally, baby axolotls follow adults.

A player can [[breed]] axolotls by using buckets of tropical fish. After breeding, a baby axolotl spawns and 1–7 [[experience]] is generated. The parents cannot be bred again for 5 minutes {{in|je}} or 1 minute {{in|be}}. The baby axolotl has a {{frac|1|1200}} chance to be the rare blue variant; otherwise, it inherits the color of one parent at random.

Baby axolotls take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} buckets of tropical fish. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.

An axolotl loses its willingness to breed if it is picked up in a bucket and released after it is fed but before it reaches its mate. It must be fed another bucket of tropical fish to become willing to breed again.
