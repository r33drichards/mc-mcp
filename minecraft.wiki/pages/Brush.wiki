A '''brush''' is a [[tool]] used in [[archaeology]] to excavate [[suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]] for different items. It can also brush [[armadillo]]s for [[armadillo scute]]s.

== Usage ==
=== Brushing ===
{{Control|Using}} the brush on any block (apart from suspicious blocks) displays a brushing animation, slowing down the player and creating breaking [[particles]], but not actually damaging the block or brush.

==== Suspicious blocks ====
{{Main|Suspicious Sand|Suspicious Gravel}}
When continuously brushing [[suspicious sand]] or [[suspicious gravel]], an item dependent on the [[structure]]'s loot table slowly emerges from it until it drops out, and the block turns into regular [[sand]] or regular [[gravel]], depleting 1 [[durability]] point on the brush. It takes 96 [[game tick]]s (4.8 seconds) to brush a single suspicious block.

If the player stops brushing a suspicious block, the block remains in its half-excavated state for a few seconds, before gradually returning to its unexcavated state one stage at a time.

==== Armadillos ====
When {{Control|using}} the brush on an [[armadillo]], it drops a single [[armadillo scute]]. Brushing an armadillo removes 16 points of durability from the brush. A brush with full durability and no enchantments can brush an armadillo four times {{in|java}} or five times {{in|bedrock}} before breaking.

=== Repairing ===
