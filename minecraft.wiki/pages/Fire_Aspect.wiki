'''Fire Aspect''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[sword]]s, [[mace]]s, and [[spear]]s that [[Burning|ignites]] entities hit with melee attacks.

== Obtaining ==
Fire Aspect can be obtained from [[enchanting table]]s, drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]],{{only|bedrock}} books obtained by [[fishing]], librarian [[villager]]s, and in the following structure loot chests: [[desert pyramid]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[ancient city|ancient cities]], [[mansion]]s, [[pillager outpost]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, and from vaults in [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
Fire Aspect adds 80 fire-ticks (4 seconds of burning) per level to the target. Because the first hit is caused by the item with this enchantment, the first second of fire damage is not recognized. Targets receive {{hp|3}} and {{hp|7}} damage with level I and II respectively.

Formula to calculate the fire damage, expressed in {{hp|1}}: <code>damage = (''level'' × 4) – 1</code>

When a mob that normally drops raw meat is killed while it is burning, or if a mob is killed directly by the enchanted weapon, even if it is in water, it drops cooked meat.

{{IN|be}}, {{Control|using}} an item enchanted with Fire Aspect on an unlit [[candle]] or [[campfire]] lights it. Additionally, doing this on a block of [[TNT]] or [[minecart with TNT]] causes it to ignite.

=== Specific cases ===
If Fire Aspect is applied to a trident by use of [[command]]s or an [[anvil]] in Creative, the enchantment does not cause the weapon's thrown projectile to set targets on fire or ignite [[TNT]], [[TNT minecart]]s, [[candle]]s, and [[campfire]]s. Instead, [[Flame]] has the igniting effects, but doesn't set targets on fire either.

== Immune mobs ==
Both Fire Aspect and Flame are nullified on all [[Nether]] exclusive mobs other than [[piglin]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, and [[hoglin]]s due to fire and lava immunity. [[Ender dragon]]s, [[wither]]s, and [[warden]]s are also immune. Normal [[skeleton]]s and [[endermen]] are not immune even in the Nether.
