{{for|the official {{MC}} server list|Official Minecraft Server List}}
''Minecraft'' includes an in-game '''server list''' for [[multiplayer]] in which users can join and save the [[server]]s they visit. Players can see if a server is online, check how many player slots it has, and how good the connection to the server is.

When first loading up the multiplayer list, the [[player]] receives a warning regarding [[:en:File:Multiplayer_disclaimer.png|online play not being rated.]] If the player wishes not to see this again, there is an option that disables the warning permanently.

== ''Java Edition'' ==

The server list allows players to save a new server on the list, join an already existing one, or directly connect to a server by manually specifying the server address.

Servers appear on the list in a set order, which can be changed by hovering over a server icon and using the arrows to move the server up or down on the list. Alternatively, player can hold {{key|Shift}} and press the up {{key|&uarr;}} and down {{key|&darr;}} arrow keys on the [[controller|keyboard]].

Once a server is added, it appears on the list and contains four main elements:

* '''{{va|Server icon}}''' and '''server title''' on the first row, which shows the server icon in 64x64 pixel size and the title specified by the player. The server icon can be specified by adding {{cd|server-icon.png}} image file into the [[server.jar]]'s working directory. By default, if the server icon is not specified, it shows a grayscale [[pack.png]] as a fallback.

* '''{{va|Message of the day|MOTD}}''' (often abbreviated as '''MOTD''') on the second row, which shows a short message from the server. The message can be specified through {{cd|motd}} option in the [[server.properties]], and supports the [[Formatting codes|legacy formatting codes]] for text customization. By default, the MOTD is written as "A Minecraft Server".

* '''Status indicator''' on the top right, which shows the number of online players in the server, and a network bar indicator that shows how good the player's connection to the server; when hovering over the indicator, a tooltip shows the player's {{w|Lag (video games)#Ping time|ping time}} to the server.

The game automatically lists [[LAN|LAN-based servers]] at the bottom, usually containing the server's [[operator|owner]], world name, and address on the {{w|Local area network|local network}}.

The ping icons correspond to the following ping times:
{| class="wikitable pixel-image"
!Icon
!Server ping time
|-
|[[File:Ping_unknown.png|width=20x20]]
|Can't connect to server
|-
|[[File:Ping_5.png|width=20x20]]
|Between 0 and 150ms
|-
|[[File:Ping_4.png|width=20x20]]
|Between 150 and 300ms
|-
|[[File:Ping_3.png|width=20x20]]
|Between 300 and 600ms
|-
|[[File:Ping_2.png|width=20x20]]
|Between 600 and 1000ms
|-
|[[File:Ping_1.png|width=20x20]]
|Above 1000ms
|}

[[File:Ore UI - Play Screen Menu "Servers" Tab - Other Server (Bedrock).png|400px|thumb|right|The "Other Server" list shows additional servers added by the player.]]

The server list essentially functions the same as ''Java Edition'' counterpart, except it has a separate section where players can join [[featured servers]] that have partnered with [[Mojang Studios]].

Players can add external servers on the "Other Server" section. These servers are sorted by the most recently played first on the list. This feature is unavailable for console versions of ''Bedrock Edition''.

When a server is selected, the right side of the screen provides detailed description about the server:
* For featured servers, it shows the server's banner alongside the ping strength and player count, and the next row shows the server's title. The second and third row are reserved for the server's description and activities.
** The server activities are specified by the server operator themself, they usually show and promote [[Server#Minigame|minigames]] and unique features of the server itself.
* For external servers, the top header shows ping strength and player count, with bottom rows showing the server's name, address, and port.
** The server's MOTD can be seen on the list under the server's name. Although shown on the client, the official [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]] does not provide an option to specify the server's MOTD. Instead, the MOTD can be specified using a third-party software, like [https://geysermc.org/ GeyserMC].

LAN-based servers are shown on the [[Select World#Worlds|"Worlds" tab]] instead.

The ping icons correspond to the following ping times:
{| class="wikitable pixel-image"
!Icon
!Server ping time
|-
|[[File:Ore_UI_-_Loading_Ping_Icon_(Bedrock).png|link=|width=20x20]]
|Can't connect to server
|-
|[[File:Ore_UI_-_Low_Ping_Icon_(Bedrock).png|link=|width=20x20]]
|Between 0 and 150ms
|-
|[[File:Ore_UI_-_Medium_Ping_Icon_(Bedrock).png|link=|width=20x20]]
|Between 150 and 300ms
|-
|[[File:Ore_UI_-_High_Ping_Icon_(Bedrock).png|link=|width=20x20]]
|Between 300 and 600ms
|}

== Public server list ==
=== Official Minecraft Server List ===
{{main|Official Minecraft Server List}}
The Official Minecraft Server List is published by GamerSafer and Mojang Studios. It includes variety of servers for players to choose, such as [[Server#Minigame|minigame]]s, [[SMP]]s, [[creative]] builds, and more. The website also includes server badges, which are awarded by GamerSafer, and show additional safety features they provide.

All servers listed on the website are required to comply with [https://aka.ms/MCUsageGuidelines Minecraft Usage Guidelines] (MUG) and [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula End-user license agreement] (EULA), and have been vetted by both GamerSafer and the [https://x.com/IP_Justice Mojang Enforcement Team]. They must also provide official contact information and state the purpose of the server.

=== Community server list ===
Several websites provide a place for server owners to publicly advertise their servers, listing IP addresses and other information about these servers. There were two sites of note (both defunct): the official Classic server list maintained by [[Mojang Studios]] and the [https://minecraftforum.net/servers public server list] at the [[Minecraft Forums]]. Since Minecraft Forums has shut down their public server list as of June 27th 2018 the only alternative to find Minecraft Servers to play on ''Java Edition'' is through a public server list found online. There are many popular server lists that mirror how Minecraft Forums system worked when it was live.
<!-- A LIST OF SITES IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED ON THIS WIKI. DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER LINKS. -->
