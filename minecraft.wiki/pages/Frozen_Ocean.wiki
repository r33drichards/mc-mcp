The '''frozen ocean''' is a cold variant of [[ocean]]s covered by [[Iceberg (feature)|icebergs]]. The water's surface is partially covered with [[ice]], where [[snowfall]] may occur and [[polar bears]] can spawn.

== Description ==
[[File:Ocean colors.png|thumb|200px|The separate colors of each ocean variant {{in|java}}.]]
The frozen ocean has low temperature and often borders [[snowy beach]]es. They generate next to [[snowy plains]], [[ice spikes]], and [[snowy taiga]]s usually, but they can also generate next to regular [[taiga]] biomes, resulting in incorrect and weird generation. Like the standard and cold oceans, it has a gravel seabed, though the water's surface is mostly frozen. Neither seagrass nor kelp generates on the seafloor, leaving it entirely barren and reminiscent of pre-[[Update Aquatic]] oceans. Large [[iceberg]]s made of [[snow block]]s, [[packed ice]] and a bit of [[blue ice]] frequently generate on the surface.

Frozen oceans have varying temperatures across their landscapes, and have a more noticeable effect in that colder patches have snowfall and ice sheets, while warmer patches have rainfall (up to a certain height) and unfrozen water. See also [[Biome#Temperature]].

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], frozen oceans use default environmental settings with a strong cold color grading, making the biome appear colder blue.

== Sounds ==
When in any ocean biome, unique ocean [[ambience]] play randomly. Normal overworld tracks also play, alongside "Axolotl", "Dragon Fish" and "Shuniji", as the requirements for those are merely to be underwater rather than biome-determined.

== Trivia ==
*Before [[1.18]], regular and deep frozen oceans could generate near any kind of biome. It was somewhat common to see an [[iceberg]] bordering a [[desert]], [[savanna]] or [[badlands]] in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''. Until 1.18, frozen oceans had a rough regular ocean border to minimize this effect in ''[[Java Edition]]''.
