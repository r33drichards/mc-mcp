'''16w02a''' is the forty-ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on January 13, 2016.<ref name="blogpost">{{link|url=https://www.mojang.com/2016/01/minecraft-snapshot-16w02a/||archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202011018/https://www.mojang.com/2016/01/minecraft-snapshot-16w02a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 16w02a|author=Searge|website=Mojang.com|date=Jan 13, 2016}}</ref> This is the first snapshot released in 2016.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Volume slider labeled "Voice/Speech" under "Music & Sounds".
** Intended to be used for voice acting in custom maps.<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|687741330995429376|that's the idea, yes|January 14, 2016}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Air]]'''
* Now translatable into other languages, for the purposes of superflat customization.

'''[[Beacon]]s'''
* Now immediately activate when placed on valid pyramids.

'''[[Bedrock]]'''
* Can no longer drop itself as an item.

'''[[Stone button]]s'''
* Now break faster with pickaxes.

'''[[Wooden button]]s'''
* Now break faster with axes.

=== Items ===
'''[[Armor]]'''
* Changed damage/armor values again to protect armored players against "backstabbing" creepers.
** Reduction in effective defense points due to attack strength no longer takes the effective defense below 25% of the armor points.
** Max (20) armor points damage reduction increased back to 80% (was 66% since [[15w36a]]).

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Mobs are now knocked back from non-entity damage sources such as cacti (reverted in [[16w03a]]).

'''[[Ender dragon]]s '''
* When summoned using {{cmd|summon EnderDragon}}, stay in the same position no matter what.
** Unlike summoning a dragon with <code>{NoAI:1b}</code>, it still flaps its wings.
** These dragons do not show their boss health bar, nor do they take damage from any attack other than {{cmd|/kill}}.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Armor stand]]s'''
* Marker <code>ArmorStand</code>s now only outlines their equipment when glowing.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|help}}'''
* Now outputs various [[Easter eggs#Searge says|messages]] prefixed by "Searge says:" when run in a command block.

'''{{cmd|playsound}} '''
* Now accepts a sound <code><nowiki><source></nowiki></code> as its second parameter.

'''[[Selector]]'''
* <code>m</code>
** Now supports both negation and literal gamemode values. 
*** Example: <code>@p[m=!1]</code>, <code>@p[m=c]</code>, and <code>@p[m=!spectator]</code>.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Combat'''
* Attack cooldown does not have as great an effect on damage: reduction is linear 50%–100% rather than quadratic 0%–100%.
