| The [[Evoker King]] has evolved into the [[Evoker Kid]], a total noob who wants to experience everything the world of [[Minecraft]] has to offer. Unfortunately, he walks into danger at every turn, so it’s up to [[Morgan]], [[Harper Houston|Harper]], and their friends to keep him safe. But even more unfortunately in the real world, they’ve all been sent [[Ironsword Academy Middle School]] for the remainder of the school year. Now they’re all noobs who will have to navigate the strange new school’s hallways, try to make friends with new kids, and avoid a principal who would like nothing better than to shut down their video game time. Can they get the Evoker Kid to a safe destination before someone pulls the plug on their Minecraft server… permanently?!
