== Synopsis ==

Journeying into the unknown is a scary prospect, but together Guy and Summer can navigate any challenge. The two castaways strike out in this curious, blocky world, searching for a way home. As they cross the Overworld—traversing frozen wastelands and scorching deserts—the pair makes an exciting discovery: a community populated by villagers!
 
Guy and Summer settle in to learn more about their new friends, trading with the residents and exploring the surrounding area as they work out the next steps in their voyage. But with monstrous mobs and perilous pitfalls around every corner, they soon find that they might be needed here more than they’d thought.
 
When a villager disappears, their investigation uncovers new foes—ones so powerful that this might spell the end of their adventure. Drawing on the lessons they’ve learned along the way, Guy and Summer must work together to protect the village.<ref name=MCTheVillage/>

==Trivia==
{{spoiler warning|section|this book|You may want to [[Minecraft: The Village#Gallery|skip]] this section. }}

*In the book, Guy saw 'Soul Speed' as an option from an enchanting table, which is impossible in-game as it is a treasure enchantment. Similarly, Summer obtained Frost Walker, which is another treasure enchantment.
*Near the end, Guy found out in a book that it takes 4 ender pearls (along with blaze powder) to craft an eye of ender, whereas it only takes one in-game.
*After Guy got poisoned by a witch, he drank a milk bucket in the middle of a raid. All of a sudden, the raiders stopped calling more people. However, in the game drinking milk ''during'' a raid wouldn't do anything as the [[Raid Omen]] effect has already been triggered. 
<!-- I know the spoiler warning is practically useless, but I don't have a good idea on fixing it. -->
