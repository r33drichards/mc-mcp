A '''potato village''' is a joke version of the [[village]], added in [[Java Edition 24w14potato|24w14potato]]. It generates in the [[Potato dimension]].

== Generation ==
Potato villages can generate in [[arboretum]], [[corruption]], or [[fields]] biomes. It often generates partially or even completely over the [[void]], creating a small island for itself.

== Structure ==
Potato villages are very similar to plains villages, but instead using potato blocks. A [[potato]] variant of [[villager]]s spawn in this structure, as well as normal [[iron golem]]s and [[cat]]s like in other [[Village|villages]].

Farms use [[poison farmland]] and [[potato stem]] instead of farmland and [[Log|logs]], and housed are connected with roads made of [[poison path]]s. [[Potato fruit]] is generating both in piles (instead of hay bales) and as a light source, held by [[potato pedicule]]s. Houses are made of potato stems, [[Potato Stairs|stairs]], [[Potato Door|doors]], and [[Potato Planks|planks]], as well as [[expired baked potato bricks]], [[taterstone]] and its variants, [[strong roots]] and blocks of lime [[Potato Peels|potato peels]].

Small stations with [[Frying Table|frying tables]] are features unique to potato villages. Besides the frying table, these contain [[Potato Stairs|potato stairs]], a [[bamboo pressure plate]], and an [[item frame]] with a potato in it. A small tree-like object, made out of [[potato leaves]] and pedicules, generates above the frying table. One [[composter]] generates behind it.

Another feature unique to potato villages are hedge mazes, made out of potato leaves. These do not seem to serve any purpose besides decoration.

== Loot ==
Potato villages have the same loot as normal [[village]]s.
