The '''Bacon Cape''' is a personal [[cape]] that was briefly given out.

== Distribution ==
This cape was given to Miclee by [[Notch]] for his idea of adding [[pigmen]].<ref>{{tweet|notch|25340387308601344|@Micleee There you go.}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|28832121068|@Micleee thank you!}}</ref> The cape was made by Miclee himself.<ref>{{tweet|micleee|24153383925452801|Bored, so I made a bacon cape. http://i.imgur.com/1YJIQ.png}}{{dead link}}</ref>

The cape, however, was revoked due to a large influx of players asking Notch for their own capes.{{Cn}}
