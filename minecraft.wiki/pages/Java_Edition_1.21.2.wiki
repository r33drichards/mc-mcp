=== Items ===
''' [[Banner pattern]]s '''
* Two new banner patterns have been added to achieve parity with {{BE}}:
** [[File:Field Masoned Banner Pattern JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Field masoned banner pattern]]
** [[File:Bordure Indented Banner Pattern JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Bordure indented banner pattern]]

''' [[File:Bundle_JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Bundle]] '''
* A new item that can hold a mixed stack of up to 64 items.
* Crafted from a [[string]] and a piece of [[leather]].
{{Crafting Table
|B1 = String
|B2 = Leather
|Output = Bundle
}}
* Can be dyed into 16 colors. Once dyed, the color can not be reset to default.<ref>{{bug|MC-276814|||Invalid}}</ref>
{{Crafting Table
|A1 = Any Bundle
|B1 = Matching Dye
|Output = Matching Dyed Bundle
}}
* Items that stack up to 16 take up more space, while items that do not stack take up the entire bundle (except other bundles).
** [[Shulker box]]es can not be placed in bundles.
** Bundles can be placed in other bundles; this takes up 4 slots plus the number of slots already used by the inner bundle.
* Has a tooltip that shows the items inside.
** If a bundle has less than 8 item types inside, the tooltip shows all of them.
** Otherwise the tooltip shows the top 3 rows of items and the others are hidden below, always showing at least 12 item types.
* When holding a bundle in hand, the player can throw out one group of items onto the ground by pressing {{control|use}}.
* It is possible to select any of the visible items to pull out of the bundle.
** Pressing {{control|use}} takes the selected item, or the first item if nothing is selected.
** Using the scroll wheel selects a different item.
** When selecting an item to remove, the bundle icon shows that item poking out of the bundle.

=== Mobs ===
''' [[File:Dolphin.png|32px]] [[Dolphin]], [[File:Glow Squid.png|32x32px]] [[glow squid]], [[File:Squid.png|32x32px]] [[squid]] '''
* Now have a baby variant to achieve parity with {{BE}}.

''' [[File:Salmon.png|32px]] [[Salmon]] '''
* Now have small and large variants to achieve parity with {{BE}}.

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[Death messages]] '''
* Added a new death message for when killed by a mace smash attack.
**'''{{ph|player/mob}} was smashed by {{ph|player/mob}}'''
**'''{{ph|player/mob}} was smashed by {{ph|player/mob}} with {{ph|item}}'''

''' [[Sound]]s '''
* Added unique break, fall, hit, place, and step sounds for [[monster spawner]]s.
{{collapse
|title=The new sounds:
|content=
{{Sound table/Block/Monster spawner/JE}}
}}

=== General ===
''' [[Experiments]] '''
* Added the [[Minecart Improvements]], [[Redstone Experiments]], and [[Winter Drop]] experimental data packs.

''' [[Language]]s '''
* Added support for [[w:Høgnorsk|High Norwegian]].

''' [[Options]] '''
* Added new video setting "Reduce FPS when" that controls when the game limits its maximum frame rate.
** Options include：
*** AFK: FPS limited to 30 if the game hasn't received input for 1 minute, and further limits FPS to 10 after 9 minutes. Also limits FPS to 10 when the game is minimized.
*** Minimized: Only limits FPS to 10 when the game is minimized.
** Defaults to AFK.
* Added new accessibility setting "Increase block outline contrast" that increases the contrast of the outline shown on blocks.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
''' [[Loom]] '''
* Now requires [[field masoned banner pattern]] and [[bordure indented banner pattern]] to craft corresponding banners.

''' [[Nether portal]] '''
* Reduced teleport cooldown for [[minecart]]s and [[boat]]s from 15 seconds to 0.5 seconds.
* Reduced teleport cooldown for [[projectile]]s from 15 seconds to 0.1 seconds.

''' [[Redstone torch]] '''
* The textures and models have changed.

''' [[Redstone comparator]]s and [[redstone repeater]]s '''
* The powered models have changed to include the updated redstone torch textures and models.

''' [[Slime block]]s '''
* Now cancel fall damage when sneaking.

=== Items ===
''' [[Banner pattern]]s '''
* Added unique item textures for each banner pattern.
* Each banner pattern item now includes their pattern in their name instead of as a subtitle.

''' [[Bee nest]]s and [[beehive]]s '''
* Now show information about their honey level and number of bees in their inventory tooltip.
* Now use their "full" texture when held or in the inventory, and they are at max level of honey.

''' [[Bundle]] '''
* No longer experimental.
* Updated textures, models and sounds for bundles.
** Bundle icon has new models and textures.
** The bundle UI has new textures and scaling.
** Added a new sound for when failing to add an item to a bundle.
* Now only drop one group of items at a time when {{control|used}} in the hotbar, instead of all contents at once.

''' [[Carpet]] '''
* Now shows the enchantment glint on [[llama]]s when enchanted.

''' [[Carved pumpkin]] '''
* Equipping it on the player's head now removes the player marker from other players' [[map]]s.

''' Dyed [[shulker box]] '''

''' [[Ender pearl]] '''
* Thrown ender pearls now load and tick chunks around them in a 3x3 chunk area.
** Now ensure that the chunk they are in or travel into is always loaded and ticking.
** An ender pearl creates a ticket for chunk loading any time it moves into a new chunk, and also periodically every 10 seconds.
** They also load chunks when crossing to a new dimension, so that they can always continue to travel.
** This ensures that ender pearls can always land, and makes cross dimensional ender pearl traveling more predictable.
** Now unload when a player logs out, and reappear whenever that player logs back in, similar to how mounts currently behave.

''' [[Milk bucket]] '''
* Drinking a milk bucket in Creative mode no longer gives the player an empty bucket.

''' [[Shield]] '''
* Enchanted shields now have the same reduced glint as enchanted armor.

''' [[Smithing template]]s '''
* Are now named after their template type instead of the generic "Smithing Template" name.
** They instead specify that they are a smithing template through a subtitle in the hover text.

''' [[Splash potion]] '''

''' [[Suspicious stew]] '''
* Recipes for suspicious stew are now shown in [[recipe book]].

''' [[Wolf armor]] '''
* Now shows the enchantment glint on [[wolves]] when enchanted.

=== Mobs ===
''' [[Bat]] '''
* Can now spawn at any height, not just below sea level, as long as it is dark enough and there is a solid block to spawn on.

''' [[Bee]] '''
* Now wander around randomly for less time after exiting a nest/hive.
* If a bee has a known nest/hive, it travels less far from it, thus being less likely to get lost.
* Significantly increased the amount of time a bee can take to return to a known nest/hive before it gives up trying to return home.
* Bees are now a lot less likely to get stuck on corners or when they are close to a nest/hive they are trying to return to.
* Bees are also now a lot less likely to try and pathfind to a flower they cannot reach.

''' [[Blaze]] '''
* Changed the texture for the bottom face of a blaze's rods from [[File:Blaze rods_JE1_(facing_NWU).png|32px]] to [[File:Blaze rods_JE2_(facing_NWU).png|32px]].

* No longer have a minimum distance required to attack a target.

''' [[Squid]] '''
* There is a 5% chance of squid spawned in groups in the wild to be a baby squid.

* Added new variations to the hallways, including "Encounters": short challenges leading to a larger chamber.
* Numerous changes are made, such as removing the [[oak tree]] in <code>corridor/entrance_1</code> and tweaking <code>corridor/straight_6</code>{{info needed|Full list of changes?}}
* Beds in intersections now have their colors randomized.
* Replaced the empty chests at the entrance of chamber with a hopper and barrel to better show the players that these are meant for disposal and inventory management.

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[Advancement]]s '''
* The Over-Overkill advancement now requires a smash attack.

''' [[Creative]] mode '''
* Throwing items out of the inventory quickly in creative mode is now throttled.

''' [[Damage#Drowning|Oxygen]] bar '''
* Added an empty state for air bubbles ([[File:Empty Bubble (icon).png|class=pixel-image|18px]]) along with a wobble when the player is drowning.
* Added a popping sound for when bubbles pop on the oxygen bar, increasing in pitch depending on the oxygen left.

''' [[Raid]]s '''
* A triggered raid no longer starts if the raiders cannot find a place to spawn within a reasonable distance of the village they are trying to raid.

== Experimental ==
=== Minecart Improvements ===
{{main|Minecart Improvements}}

==== Changes ====
''' [[File:Minecart JE4 BE2.png|32px]] [[Minecart]]s '''
* Minecarts articulate their movement better when going fast, riding on the rail all the time.
** Minecarts now smoothly turn along with the track and are less likely to halt or derail.
* Can now jump better.
** They keep their vertical momentum when the track ends with a slope.
** Minecarts tilt to visually articulate while in the air.
** No rail grinding sound is played when minecarts are flying through the air.
* Can no longer be placed within another minecart by the player.
** Dispensers are allowed to stack minecarts.
* Can now consistently be placed next to each other along a track
* Can now pick up mobs more consistently when moving along a track
* Minecarts no longer forcefully snap to the center of a block when landing on a rail.
** Minecarts snap to corners along the diagonal, and snaps after being pushed by a piston.
** This allows for piston bolts and similar contraptions.
* Minecarts now more easily come to rest at opposing slopes.
* Minecarts no longer tilt during a short fall, or when they are falling straight down.
* Minecarts are now placed (or dispensed) with the correct rotation straight away when put on rails.
** They are also placed with the correct rotation onto slopes.
* Minecarts no longer phase through blocks on slopes when going up or down, they collide instead.

''' [[Game rule]]s '''
* Added new gamerule <code>minecartMaxSpeed</code> that changes the maximum speed of minecarts.
** Defaults to <code>8</code> and goes up to <code>1000</code> blocks per second.
** Setting it to a specific value does not guarantee that a minecart reaches that particular max speed - there are built in air resistances and similar effects that the speed added through slopes or powered rails need to overcome.
** This gamerule only exists in worlds with the experiment Minecart Improvements enabled.

''' [[Options]] '''
* Added a new accessibility setting that makes players follow the rotation of minecarts they ride.
** Defaults to off.
** Only has effect when within a world with the experiment Minecart Improvements enabled.

=== Redstone Experiments ===
{{main|Redstone Experiments}}

==== Changes ====
''' [[Redstone wire]] '''
* The performance impact of redstone wire (connected blocks of redstone dust) has been improved.
* Now only triggers block updates on blocks that may receive power from the wire.
* Before a line of wire causes block updates, the new signal strength of all connected wires is set.
* The update order around redstone wire has been changed. 
* Updates now have a left-first preference, meaning the left side is updated first if both sides of a fork have equal power.
** This removes most of the random behavior.
** The remaining edge cases that are still random are situations where the wire gets powered from above or below without enough context.

** Is active during night and dormant during day.
* Sends a trail of particles toward the connected creaking when the creaking gets hit by the player.
** Particle speed is affected by the distance of the creaking from the heart block.
* Mining the block is most efficiently done with an axe, but it only drops when using a [[Silk Touch]] tool.
** When creaking heart block is destroyed, the connected creaking is removed.
* A [[redstone comparator]] that is attached to the creaking heart block outputs a signal strength dependent on the distance to the connected creaking.

''' [[File:Invicon Pale Hanging Moss.png|32px]] [[Pale hanging moss]] '''
* Pale hanging moss generates naturally in the pale garden biome under the foliage of pale oaks.
** Pale hanging moss does not grow randomly but can be bonemealed to grow down.

===== Mobs =====
''' [[File:Creaking JE1.png|x32px]] [[Creaking]] '''
'''<!-- Technically the creaking is a dummy mob the actual mob with the properties described is called the transient creaking. I don't know how to mention that though due to formatting. Please don't change until a unanimous consensus is met. --> '''
* Spawns at night in the pale garden biome if there is a creaking heart block that has been generated in a pale oak tree.
** Is not affected by light levels but spawns and despawns based on day/night cycle.
* It follows and attack players up to 32 blocks away from its creaking heart block.
** An activated creaking does not move if a player is looking at it.
** A player wearing a carved pumpkin on their head can look at creaking without it freezing in place.
* Creaking is invulnerable to damage.
** When hit, a particle trail is shown between the creaking and the creaking heart block it is connected to.
** When the creaking heart block the creaking is connected to is destroyed, the creaking is removed, with no loot or experience dropped from the mob.
* Cannot enter [[boat]]s without the use of glitches.
* Creakings spawned from a creaking heart can not go through portals without the use of glitches.
* Creakings spawned from a creaking heart can not be named with a [[name tag]].
* The creaking spawn egg spawns a creaking mob that is not connected to a creaking heart. The creaking mob persists through day and night, loads and saves, and takes damage from attacks and other damage sources. It has one point of health (half a heart).
** Creakings summoned from the creaking heart cannot be spawned with a spawn egg, nor can they be summoned with commands. They can only exist as a part of the creaking heart block.

** Generates naturally in the pale garden biome. 

===== General =====
''' [[Sound]]s '''
* Ambient sounds in the pale garden biome do not come from the biome settings but are generated by blocks found in the biome.
** Pale hanging moss emits subtle atmospheric sounds when it is attached to pale oak logs and pale oak leaves.
** Creaking heart block emits a set of eerie sounds when it is active during night and surrounded by logs on all sides.

==== [[Shader]]s ====
''' [[Shader]] program configurations '''
* Can now specify preprocessor define directives to be injected into the shader source, which can be referenced in the shader
** In the vanilla assets, this is used to combine multiple shaders into one program. For example, <code>rendertype_cutout</code>, <code>rendertype_solid</code>, <code>rendertype_cutout_mipped</code>, <code>rendertype_transluscent</code> and <code>rendertype_tripwire</code> now use the <code>terrain.fsh / .vsh</code> shaders. Define directives are used alongside an <code>#ifdef ALPHA_CUTOUT</code> statement in the <code>terrain.fsh</code> program to control if the shader program should discard transparent pixels.
** These can be specified in a new <code>defines</code> object in the root of the shader json file
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt | compound}} The root tag
** {{nbt | compound | defines}} Preprocessor directives that can be used in shader programs.
*** {{nbt | compound | values}} Preprocessor directives with a value, can be used with <code>#ifdef</code>, <code>#ifndef</code> or directly as a variable in a program.
**** {{nbt | string | value}} A preprocessor directive. The key is the name of the directive. It can be anything, but must be in all capitals. Injected as <code>#define <key> <value></code> at the top of the shader source.
*** {{nbt | list | flags}} Flag directives, can be used with <code>#ifdef</code> or <code>#ifndef</code> in a program.
**** {{nbt | string | flag}} The name of a flag. This can be anything, but must be in all capitals. Injected as <code>#define <key></code> at the top of the shader source.
</div>
* The <code>blend</code> field has been removed, as it had no use
* The <code>attributes</code> field has been removed, instead the <code>Position</code> attribute is always bound
* The <code>vertex</code> and <code>fragment</code> shader references in program definitions are now namespaced ids
** A vertex shader <code><namespace>:<path></code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.vsh</code>
** A fragment shader <code><namespace>:<path></code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.fsh</code>

''' Uniforms '''
* The <code>ChunkOffset</code> uniform in terrain shaders has been renamed to <code>ModelOffset</code>
* The <code>Time</code> uniform for post-processing shaders has been replaced with the <code>GameTime</code> uniform from core shaders 
* There are 9 new uniforms that are available in the new <code>lightmap</code> shader.
** <code>AmbientLightFactor</code>, <code>SkyFactor</code>, <code>BlockFactor</code>, <code>UseBrightLightmap</code>, <code>SkyLightColor</code>, <code>NightVisionFactor</code>, <code>DarknessScale</code>, <code>DarkenWorldFactor</code> and <code>BrightnessFactor</code>

''' Imports '''
* The <code>#moj_import</code> directive now supports namespaced includes with absolute paths
** <code>#moj_import <<namespace>:<shader program>></code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/include/<shader program></code>
* Relative imports are not namespaced and behave as before

''' Post-processing effects '''
* Post-processing effect configurations have been moved from <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/post</code> to <code>assets/<namespace>/post_effect</code>
* Vertex and fragment shaders used by post-processing effects have been moved from <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/program</code> to <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/post</code>.
* The format of post-processing effect configurations have been updated.
* <code>name</code> has been renamed to <code>program</code>, and is now a namespaced id of a shader program configuration.
** <code><namespace>:<path></code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.json</code>.
* <code>intarget</code> and <code>auxtargets</code> have been merged into a single <code>inputs</code> list, as specified by the input format below.
* <code>outtarget</code> has been renamed to <code>output</code> with the same format.
* <code>targets</code> is now a map between target name and target definition, as opposed to a list
** Inline target names are replaced with an empty object
*** For example, <code>["swap"]</code> becomes <code>{"swap": {}}</code>
** Target definitions with a specific size remain the same, with the <code>name</code> field moved into the map key
*** For example, <code>[{"name": "potato", "width": 16, "height": 16}]</code> becomes <code>{"potato": {"width": 16, "height": 16}}</code>

''' Inputs '''
* For both render targets and texture inputs, the following fields may be specified:
** {{nbt | string | sampler_name}} The prefix to set up both <code>_Sampler</code> and <code>_Size</code> uniforms.
** {{nbt | boolean | bilinear}} (default: false) If true, the input is sampled with a bilinear filter. For render targets, this replaces the removed <code>use_linear_filter</code> field on the pass definition.

* For inputs from a render target, the following fields may be specified:
** {{nbt | string | target}} The render target id, a namespaced id. Either a custom target id defined in the same file, or <code>minecraft:main</code> to reference the main screen target. This replaces the former <code>id</code> field, which was a free-form string.
** {{nbt | boolean | use_depth_buffer}} (default: false) Set to true to sample from the depth texture, false to sample from the color texture. This replaces the former <code>:depth</code> suffix applied to the target id.

* For inputs from a static texture, the following fields may be specified:
** {{nbt | string | location}} The location to a static texture file that can be sampled by the effect. As the <code>id</code> field did before, this resolves to a texture at <code>assets/<namespace>/textures/effect/<path>.png</code>
** {{nbt | int | width}} Width of the texture in pixels, must be a positive integer.
** {{nbt | int | width}} Height of the texture in pixels, must be a positive integer.

''' External inputs '''

** These are instead imported in the same way as the <code>minecraft:main</code> target.
** <code>translucent</code>, <code>itemEntity</code>, <code>particles</code>, <code>weather</code>, <code>clouds</code> are now <code>minecraft:translucent</code>, <code>minecraft:item_entity</code>, <code>minecraft:particles</code>, <code>minecraft:weather</code>, and <code>minecraft:clouds</code> respectively.
* The entity outline processing shader similarly imports the <code>minecraft:entity_outline</code> target

''' Core shaders '''
* Some core shaders now share the same shader programs.
** The <code>rendertype_clouds</code> shader no longer gets the cloud texture sampler.
** The <code>rendertype_cutout</code>, <code>rendertype_solid</code>, <code>rendertype_cutout_mipped</code>, <code>rendertype_transluscent</code> and <code>rendertype_tripwire</code> shaders now use the <code>terrain.fsh</code> and <code>terrain.vsh</code> programs.
** The <code>rendertype_armor_cutout_no_cull</code>, <code>rendertype_breeze_wind</code>, <code>rendertype_energy_swirl</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_cutout_no_cull_z_offset</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_cutout_no_cull</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_cutout</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_no_outline</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_smooth_cutout</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_solid</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_translucent_emissive</code>, <code>rendertype_entity_translucent</code> and <code>rendertype_eyes</code> shaders now use the <code>entity.fsh</code> and <code>entity.vsh</code> programs.
* Most UI elements such as buttons, the inventory, menu backgrounds, the hotbar, etc are now rendered with <code>position_tex_color</code> instead of <code>position_tex</code>

=== Changes ===
==== [[Commands]] ====
''' [[Data component format|Data components]] '''
<code>minecraft:potion_content</code>
* Added {{nbt|string|custom_name}} field.
** Used to generate the name of the item. The game uses the translation key <code>item.minecraft.<item type>.effect.<value></code>. 
** This name has a higher priority than the <code>minecraft:item_name</code> component, but lower than the <code>minecraft:custom_name</code> component.

==== [[Data pack]]s ====
''' [[Enchantment definition|Enchantments]] '''
* Added support for enchantment trigger <code>projectile_spawned</code> in the following items:
** Snowballs
** Tridents
** Small fireballs
** Thrown potions
** Ender pearls
** Fishing rod
** Firework rocket
** Wind charge
** Eggs

''' [[Loot table]]s '''
* Sheep shearing is now controlled by loot table found as <code>shearing/sheep</code>.
* Mooshroom shearing is now controlled by loot table found as <code>shearing/mooshroom</code>.
* Snow golem shearing is now controlled by a loot table found as <code>shearing/snow_golem</code>.
* The tool value (used for functions like <code>match_tool</code>) is now available for some additional loot table types.
** <code>archaeology</code> - used brush.
** <code>vault</code> - inserted key (not available when displaying items).
** <code>shearing</code> - shears.

''' [[Predicate]]s '''
* New entity sub-predicate for testing sheep wool.
** Fields:
*** <code>sheared</code> - optional boolean.
*** <code>color</code> - optional wool dye color.

''' [[Trim]]s '''
* All equippable items with an equipment model defined support rendering trims, based on the <code>trim</code> component.
* Trim textures are loaded from the appropriate folder in the <samp>textures/trims/entity</samp> directory.
** For example, armor with wolf_body layers fetch trims from <samp>textures/trims/entity/wolf_body</samp>

==== [[Resource pack]]s ====
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>42</code>.
* Removals and renames of some deprecated translations is now automatically applied at startup.
** Packs that used those translations need to re-add them manually.
** The full list is available in <code>/assets/minecraft/lang/deprecated.json</code> file inside the game's built [[w:JAR (file format)|JAR]] file.
* Added support for emissive layers for block models.
** Added an optional <code>light_emission</code> field to block model elements.
** Integer value between 0 and 15, with 0 being the default value of no light emitted.
** If specified and non-zero, this behaves as the minimum light level that the element can receive.
* The texture map for the arrow and bee stinger models have been updated.
* The model and UV mapping of the Dragon Egg have been updated.
* The tooltip background and frame may now be customized by replacing sprites:
** <code>tooltip/background</code>: The background of the tooltip
** <code>tooltip/frame</code>: The frame appearing around the tooltip
** Items with a custom <code>tooltip_style</code> component uses sprites with IDs:
*** <code><namespace>:tooltip/<path>_background</code> and <code><namespace>:tooltip/<path>_frame</code>
* The <code>nine_slice</code> GUI sprite scaling mode has a new optional boolean (true or false) property: <code>stretch_inner</code>
** If <code>true</code>, the inner parts of the texture (i.e. not the corners) are stretched instead of tiled
** If not specified, defaults to <code>false</code> as before.
* The appearance of a highlighted slot can now be customized by replacing sprites (this supports the use of animated textures):
** <samp><code>container/slot_highlight_front</code></samp>: The sprite to render in front of highlighted slots.
** <samp><code>container/slot_highlight_back</code></samp>: The sprite to render behind highlighted slots.
* Likewise, the appearance of a highlighted item within the bundle can be customized with the following sprites:
** <code><samp>container/bundle/slot_highlight_front</samp>.</code>
** <code><samp>container/bundle/slot_highlight_back</samp>.</code>
* The appearance of highlighted items has been updated to improve visibility of the item.
* The models and UV mapping related to the [[torch]] and blocks containing [[redstone torch]] have been updated.
** The "inverted" model now uses 6 separate faces creating the same effect as a model with a negative size.
** The UV layout for the inverted model was updated.
* Added texture and sound for tweaked air bubble UI.
** New texture added for empty air bubble.
** Sound added for when air bubble pops.
* Added <code>container/bundle/slot_background</code> texture for bundle slot background.

''' [[Model]]s '''
* All [[Item (entity)|item]] models can now use the <code>broken</code> property in model overrides that was previously limited to just the [[elytra]].
** This has a value of 1 if the item has 1 durability left, or 0 otherwise.
* The appearance of equipment when equipped by players or certain mobs can now be customized by defining 'equipment models' in the [[resource pack]].
** [[Equipment]] model definitions are loaded from <code>assets/<namespace>/models/equipment/<path>.json</code>
*** These can then be referenced by the <code>equippable</code> component with a model id of <code>namespace:path</code>
** The model definition is an object with fields: <code>wolf_body</code>, <code>horse_body</code>, <code>llama_body</code>, <code>humanoid</code>, <code>humanoid_leggings</code>, <code>wings</code>
*** All fields are optional, and can be used to specify a list of layers for the given model layer type
*** Each field contains list of layer objects:
**** <code>texture</code>: namespaced texture location for this layer
***** <code>namespace:path</code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/equipment/<layer_type>/<path>.png</code>
**** <code>dyeable</code>: object with fields (optional), specifying how this layer behaves when dyed (in the <code>dyeable</code> item tag, and has <code>dyed_color</code> component)
***** <code>color_when_undyed</code>: RGB color integer (optional)
***** If specified, this layer is tinted by the color contained in the <code>dyed_color</code> component
****** If the item is not able to be dyed or is not currently dyed, then it is tinted based on the color specified by <code>color_when_undyed</code>
****** If <code>color_when_undyed</code> is not specified and the item is not dyed, the layer is hidden
**** <code>use_player_texture</code>: boolean (default: <code>false</code>), true if this layer texture should be overridden by a texture given by the player
***** Only used for <code>wings</code> layers, which overrides with the player's custom elytra texture

==== Servers ====
''' Network protocol '''
* Added <code>minecraft:client_tick_end</code> server-bound packet during play phase, sent when the client finishes processing its current tick.<!-- Changelog says Vanilla doesn't use it but it's wrong. -->
* Added ability for custom servers to override the order that players appear in the 'tab list'.
** This is controlled by a non-negative ordering index that is sorted highest to lowest.
* The client now shares the state of the 'Particles' limiter option to be used by custom servers.

''' [[Hardcore]] '''
* Hardcore is now implemented properly in the server software.
** Prior to this, the <code>hardcore</code> option in [[server.properties]] only controlled whether the player can respawn after death. It could be changed independently the world's hardcore mode (set on the world creation screen), which only controlled whether the client is informed hardcore mode is enabled on the server (which in turn decided on the hearts texture and death screen) and forced hard difficulty.
** The world's hardcore mode is now used for controlling whether the player can respawn, informing the client that the server is hardcore mode and forcing hard difficulty.
** The <code>hardcore</code> option in server.properties is now only used for enabling the world's hardcore mode during world generation.

''' [[server.properties]] '''
* Added the option <code>pause-when-empty-seconds</code>.
** When set to a positive value, causes the server to pause when no player has been online for that many seconds.
** Defaults to <code>60</code>.
* Removed the options: <code>spawn-animals</code> and <code>spawn-npcs</code>.
* Added the option <code>text-filtering-version</code>.
** Defaults to <code>0</code>.
** The purpose of this option was not announced.

''' [[Realms]] '''
* Extended the <code>text-filtering-config</code> in order to support an internal migration for Realms profanity filtering.
** Servers currently utilizing the <code>text-filtering-config</code> can continue to do so without any changes.

==== General ====
''' [[Telemetry]] '''
* Added some information about data pack structure (for example, data-driven registries) to generated reports.
