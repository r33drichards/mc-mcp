'''13w09a''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on February 26, 2013.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20200728074157/http://www.mojang.com/2013/02/minecraft-snapshot-13w09a/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General '''
* A way for mobs/entities to ride other mobs/entities.
** They no longer dismount upon reload.
** Mobs can now be spawned riding other mobs.

== Changes ==
=== Entities ===
* Player riding on an entity keeps it when logging off (the entity disappears along with player) and is still riding the entity upon logging back on.

=== General ===
'''[[Font]]s'''
* Fonts are now changeable.
* Added HD font support.

'''[[Language]]'''
* Updated language files.

'''[[Lighting]]'''
* Smooth lighting can now be changed to <code>Minimum</code>, <code>Maximum</code> & <code>Off</code>. 
** Minimum uses the old smooth lighting, and maximum fixes a bug with stairs.

'''[[Texture pack]]s'''
* Animated blocks and items in texture packs now require the animation definition.
