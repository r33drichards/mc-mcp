'''"chirp"''' refers to both a song composed by [[C418]], and a [[music disc]] that plays the song when inserted in a [[jukebox]]. The music disc is obtained from [[creeper]]s killed by [[skeleton]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
When killed by any [[skeleton]], [[stray]], [[bogged]], or [[parched]] (or [[wither skeleton]] if given a [[bow]] using commands), a [[creeper]] drops a random music disc, which has a {{frac|1|12}} chance to be "chirp".

Because [[TNT]] ignited by a flaming [[arrow]] attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with [[Flame]], or shooting through [[lava]] or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.<ref>{{bug|MC-210303|||WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-150884|||WAI}}</ref>

[[File:Chirp.ogg]]

"chirp" is a retro tune with a sample from the 1970 MATTEL Bossa Nova Style Program Disc<ref name=":0">{{ytl|G89vIy8Guj4|Optigan Program Disc: Bossa Nova Style|t=22}}</ref> playing in the background, along with a vaporwave-like version of "mall".

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "chirp" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "chirp", it emits a redstone signal of 4.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* "chirp" uses the same accompaniment samples as "The Orb of Dreamers" from the ''[[wikipedia:LittleBigPlanet|LittleBigPlanet]]'' series.<ref>{{ytl|3Jnubcn2G-Y|Daniel Pemberton - The Orb Of Dreamers}}</ref> The samples come from the {{w|Optigan}} disc "Bossa Nova Style".<ref name=":0"/> C418 stated that it was coincidental.<ref>{{tweet|1=c418|2=314472205109043200|3=Remember when people thought I plagiarized LittleBigPlanet music? Yeah, the Optigan is a lovely instrument that I will never utilize again.|4=March 20, 2013|archive=1}}</ref>
* The texture used for the music disc "chirp" was previously used for the [[camera]] tripod texture prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]].
