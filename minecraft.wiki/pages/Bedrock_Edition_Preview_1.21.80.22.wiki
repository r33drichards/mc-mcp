'''Beta 1.21.80.22''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.80.22''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the third beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.80]], released on March 26, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/35325653515149-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-80-22|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.80.22|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=March 26, 2025}}</ref> which adds [[flat]] world presets, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===

*Player can now have more variety in your flat worlds with the following presets:
**Classic Flat (The classic flat world)
**Tunnelers' Dream

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''UI'''
*Updated the friends drawer status to tell if a friend is playing in the same world as a player.

=== Technical ===
'''Block Components'''
*Removed Upcoming Creator Features experiment requirement for field {{cd|isotropic}} in {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} component.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*From 1.21.80 onward, when using a {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} component or {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} component, you must include both.

'''[[Commands]]'''
*Released {{cmd|place structure}} and {{cmd|place jigsaw}} out of the Data-Driven Jigsaw Structures experiment.

'''Components'''
*Added validation for block asset references in components.
**Content errors will log missing block references for the following components:
***item component {{cd|minecraft:digger}}
***item component {{cd|minecraft:entity_placer}}
***item component {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}}
***spawn rules component {{cd|minecraft:spawns_on_block_filter}}
***spawn rules component {{cd|minecraft:spawns_on_block_prevented_filter}}
***spawn rules component {{cd|minecraft:spawns_above_block_filter}}
**{{cd|can_be_stolen}} has been moved from {{cd|presets}} back to being a direct sub-field of the {{cd|minecraft:leashable}} component.

'''Documentation'''
*Include {{cd|biome}} and {{cd|client_biome}} JSON files in generated documentation.

'''Goals'''
*Added fields to {{cd|minecraft:behavior.tempt}} goal:
**The {{cd|stop_distance}} field specifies a custom distance for when the tempted mob should stop moving towards the player.
**The {{cd|on_start}} field specifies the event to trigger when the goal starts.
**The {{cd|on_end}} field specifies the event to trigger when the goal ends.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:behavior.float_tempt}} goal, which allows a tempted mob to move in a line towards the player:
**This goal is a variant of the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.tempt}} goal and shares the same fields
**Requires the mob to be in a floating state (e.g. use the {{cd|minecraft:navigation.float}} component)

'''[[Structure]]s'''
*Exposed new fields to data driven jigsaw structures: {{cd|start_height}}, {{cd|dimensional_padding}}, {{cd|pool_aliases}}, {{cd|max_distance_from_center}}
*Made {{cd|height_map_projection}} optional and changed {{cd|anchor}} to {{cd|start_jigsaw_name}}

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" and "Locator Bar" experimental toggles.

=== Additions===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
:{{cd|@minecraft/server 2.0.0-beta}}
*{{cd|EntitySkinIdComponent}} has been changed to read-only in version {{cd|2.0 beta}}
*Added property {{cd|localizationKey}} to {{cd|Entity}}, {{cd|Block}}, and {{cd|ItemStack}} which returns the key used for finding the localized names of these objects.
:Added new Container APIs:
*{{cd|contains(ItemStack)}}: Attempts to find an instance of an item inside the container.
*{{cd|firstEmptySlot()}}: Finds the index of the first empty slot inside the container.
*{{cd|irstItem()}}: Finds the index of the first item inside the container.
*{{cd|find(ItemStack)}}: Find the index of the first instance of an item inside the container.
*{{cd|reverseFind(ItemStack)}}: Find the index of the last instance of an item inside the container.
:Custom Commands
*Added support for custom commands authored in script. The new {{cd|CustomCommandRegistry}} is provided when listening to {{cd|ModuleStartupEvent}}. 
**Additional types added:
***{{cd|CustomCommandRegistry}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandPermissionLevel}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandParamType}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandResult}} and {{cd|CustomCommandStatus}}

=== Changes ===
==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Player locator bar]]'''
*Dots are now shown representing players in spectator mode to other players also in spectator mode on the locator bar.

==== Technical ====
