A '''trident''' is a [[weapon]] that can be used to perform {{Control|attack|text=melee attacks}}, or be {{Control|use|text=thrown}} as a [[projectile]] that is not slowed down by [[water]]. It can rarely be obtained either from trident-wielding [[drowned]] or from [[trial chambers]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|trident}}

=== Mob loot ===
6.25% of naturally-spawned [[drowned]] {{in|java}}, or 15% of naturally-spawned drowned {{in|bedrock}}, spawn with a trident of random durability as their natural weapon. When a drowned with a trident is killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]], it has a 8.5% chance {{in|java}} or a 25% chance {{in|bedrock}} of dropping the trident. This chance is increased by 1% with each level of [[Looting]].

Only naturally-spawned drowned can spawn with a trident. Zombies converted to drowned never spawn with tridents. A trident held by a drowned has a chance to be [[enchanted]]. The [[Loyalty]], [[Impaling]], and [[Channeling]] enchantments function the same, while [[Riptide]] has no effect for the drowned.

=== Thrown tridents ===
Tridents thrown onto the ground by a player can be picked up; however, tridents thrown by [[drowned]] cannot be picked up, similar to arrows shot by [[skeleton]]s and other arrow-firing mobs. 

Only the owner of a trident thrown in Creative mode or enchanted with [[Loyalty]] can pick it up; other players in Creative and players in Survival mode, including its owner, cannot pick up a trident thrown in Creative.

=== Attacking ===
==== Melee attack ====
Pressing {{control|attack}} while holding a trident deals damage to both [[mob]]s and players. Tridents deal {{hp|9}} melee damage and, in {{JE}}, have an attack speed of 1.1. Upon damaging a mob or player, the trident's [[durability]] decreases by 1. The trident's melee attack does not have any [[special attack]] mechanics that are unique to it, unlike all other melee <abbr title="Items classified as weapons due to being in the Combat tab of the Creative inventory.">weapons</abbr>.<ref group="note">[[Sword]]s can do [[sweep attack]]s, [[axe]]s can do [[crushing blow]]s, [[mace]]s can do [[smash attack]]s, and [[spear]]s can do both [[jab attack]]s and [[charge attack]]s.</ref>

==== Ranged attack ====
[[File:Steve aiming with Trident.png|thumb|upright|Steve aiming with Trident]]
[[File:Trident throwing.gif|thumb|right|Throwing a trident {{in|java}}.]]
Pressing and holding {{control|use}} while holding a trident charges it. When released at full charge, the trident is thrown and deals damage to any [[entity]] it hits. It flies on a ballistic trajectory similar to that of an [[arrow]]. If the trident hits a block, it sticks to the block. If it hits an entity, it bounces off the entity and lands nearby. It is also blocked by [[shield]]s and can be retrieved once it lands on the ground. Thrown tridents can trigger wooden [[button]]s, wooden [[pressure plate]]s, and [[target]] blocks. A trident can be thrown at a [[chorus flower]] or [[pointed dripstone]] to break it, which causes the block to be dropped as its respective item. Unlike other projectiles, the trident does not slow down when thrown through water or lava.

Tridents take 1 durability damage when thrown, regardless of whether they hit an entity or not. Tridents with 1 durability or less remaining cannot be thrown.<ref>{{bug|MC-163946||Tridents with one durability remaining can be thrown|Fixed}}</ref> {{IN|java}}, tridents despawn after 60 seconds if they are not picked up, just like [[arrow]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-125817||Tridents thrown in survival despawn after one minute}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, thrown tridents do not despawn. When thrown at the [[ender dragon]] while it is perched, they are deflected and lit on fire, in the same way as arrows.

{{IN|java}}, thrown tridents only damage one entity.<ref>{{bug|MC-125325||Tridents will not cause damage to entities after it falls from a block it was stuck in|Works As Intended}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, a trident can damage multiple entities as long as it touches a solid block before damaging the next entity; for example, a [[piston]] can move a trident into a mob.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-60933||A single trident can hurt multiple mobs in one throw|Works As Intended}}</ref> Subsequent hits from the same throw still count as player damage, meaning that mobs drop [[experience]] and [[Looting]] can be used, but the trident does not lose additional durability.

{{IN|bedrock}} and [[Java Edition Combat Test 4]], tridents can be shot by [[dispenser]]s regardless of enchantment.

{{:Calculators/Projectile motion|name=Trident|type=1|gravity=-0.05|dragx=0.99|dragy=0.99|hideproperties=1|hidedynamics=1}}

=== Drowned ===
{{main|Drowned}}
A drowned holding a trident throws tridents at its target every 1.5 seconds, dealing {{hp|9}} [[damage]] in Normal [[difficulty]]. A drowned can throw unlimited tridents, and these tridents cannot be picked up by the [[player]].

A [[villager]] can be converted into a [[zombie villager]] if it is killed by a trident thrown by a drowned. The chance of conversion is 0% on Easy [[difficulty]], 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a drowned can use the trident's melee attack if its target is within three blocks. The melee attack deals {{hp|9}} damage.

A drowned's trident can be [[enchanted]]. The Loyalty, Impaling and Channeling enchantments work the same as they would for a player, while Riptide has no effect for drowned.

==== Enchantment behavior ====
Tridents have exclusive access to the [[Impaling]], [[Loyalty]], [[Riptide]], and [[Channeling]] enchantments.

===== Impaling =====
{{main|Impaling}}
Tridents [[Enchanting#Summary_of_enchantments_by_item|enchanted]] with [[Impaling]] increase damage against mobs in certain conditions depending on the game version. {{IN|java}}, the enchantment deals extra damage to all [[aquatic]] mobs. {{IN|bedrock}}, it deals extra damage to players and mobs that are in water or rain. In the [[Java Edition Combat Tests]], it has both of these effects.

===== Loyalty =====
{{main|Loyalty}}
Tridents enchanted with [[Loyalty]] return to the thrower after hitting an entity{{only|java}}/hitting and bouncing off an entity then hitting a block{{only|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-51726|||WF}}</ref> or directly hitting a block. A Loyalty-enchanted trident fired from a [[dispenser]] just sticks to the block it strikes. Higher levels of enchantment result in shorter recovery times. {{IN|java}}, throwing a trident enchanted with Loyalty into the [[void]] destroys it,<ref>{{bug|MC-125755|||WAI}}</ref> while {{in|bedrock}} it automatically returns to the player. Loyalty-enchanted tridents can take [[fire]] damage but still return to the player if thrown in [[lava]]. This is especially helpful in [[the Nether]] if the [[player]] is using the trident instead of a [[bow]]. If a trident enchanted with Loyalty attempts to return to a player with no available inventory space, the trident floats near the player until inventory space becomes available.

===== Riptide =====
{{main|Riptide}}
Tridents enchanted with [[Riptide]] launch the player a certain distance and do not leave the player's hand when thrown, with the distance increasing for higher enchantment levels. They can be thrown only if the player is standing in [[water]] or if it is raining on the block they are standing on. If the player charges it but walks into a nearby dry area, the charge is canceled. If the player throws a Riptide trident and collides with a mob, the mob takes melee damage (including critical damage if the player is falling). {{IN|java}} tridents enchanted with Riptide take one durability damage upon throwing and lose an additional 1 durability if it collides with an entity on both editions. Each level of Riptide increases the distance traveled by six blocks. The enchantment at level one launches the player nine blocks, fifteen blocks at level two, and twenty-one blocks at level three. Using [[Riptide]], nearby players or mobs are dealt [[Harming|splash damage]] within an 8.25×8.25×4.25 cubical area. It stacks with the [[Impaling]] enchantment and [[Strength]] effect. Critical hits do not increase splash damage, but affect the target.

A trident with the [[Riptide]] enchantment can be used to propel a player wearing [[elytra]], but only in [[rain]]y weather, during snowy weather in certain biomes<ref>{{bug|MC-128169}}</ref> or while the [[player]] is in a body of water. A Riptide trident can boost the player to speeds as high as 125 blocks per second,<ref>{{bug|MC-147173||Using riptide tridents while elytra flying can boost the player to excessive speeds}}</ref> much faster than the 33.5 blocks per second speed achievable using [[firework rocket]]s.

===== Channeling =====
{{main|Channeling}}
Tridents enchanted with [[Channeling]] summon a lightning bolt if there is a thunderstorm, although only upon hitting a mob or player standing in the rain as well as a [[Lightning Rod|lightning rod]] placed in the rain.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* If a [[player]] throws a Loyalty-enchanted trident and the player's inventory subsequently fills, the trident hovers around or through the player's skin until an [[inventory]] slot opens, which it fills immediately. Multiple tridents can be 'queued' to re-enter the player's inventory in this manner.
* {{IN|java}}, if a trident is enchanted with sword enchantments (for example, via an [[anvil]] in [[Creative]] mode or through commands), the effects of most enchantments are applied even when the trident is thrown. The only exception is [[Fire Aspect]], which is applied exclusively on melee attacks.<ref>{{bug|MC-166282||Trident with Fire Aspect enchantment puts entities on fire only when used as a melee weapon|Invalid}}</ref>
* Thrown tridents pass through [[Nether portal block]]s without being transported to [[the Nether]] or the [[Overworld]].
* Using a trident enchanted with Riptide while riding an entity cancels the charge and does nothing.
* The sounds of tridents were recorded by [[Samuel Åberg]] from metal rulers.<ref>{{ytl|f0k7JNFGhms|Growth & Evolution - Part 3: 15 Years of Minecraft|Minecraft|t=479s}}</ref>
* A drowned with trident which later drops its trident as an item, enchanted with Loyalty I, shows a trident-returning animation, while still wielding earlier.
* In a behind the scenes video for ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', [[Jason Momoa]] can be seen holding a trident, which is a reference to his role as Aquaman in the DC films.<ref>{{ytl|Q2llFFHsQO0|A MINECRAFT MOVIE - A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JASON MOMOA|Warner Bros Pictures|t=58s}}</ref>
