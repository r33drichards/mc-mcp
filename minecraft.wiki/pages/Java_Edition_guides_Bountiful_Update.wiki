|-
| [[Enchanting]]
|
* Enchanting now costs from 1 to 3 pieces of [[lapis lazuli]] as well as [[XP]].

* The player still needs the same minimum total levels to unlock it.
* The actual enchantment calculations are the same.
* One and only one of the possible enchantments is displayed in the tooltip.
* The enchantments the player would get on a specific kind of [[tool]] don't change until the enchanting happens.
** This enchantment seed is stored per player.
* Leveling up takes longer.
* Level V enchantments can now appear on an item, without the use of an [[anvil]].
* Looting now gives an extra 1% chance of getting rare loot per level.
