'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Game now detects critical data pack issues, like missing required tags that prevent the world from being loaded.

'''[[Java Edition distance effects|Distance effects]]'''
[[File:Rain precision error.png|thumb|right|An example of the rain and lava smoke particles at 20 million blocks prior to 1.16-pre1. Note the clustering.]]
* Certain game mechanics, mainly a handful of different particles, have been modified to use 64-bit ([[wikipedia:Double-precision floating-point format|double-precision]]) precision where they previously used 32-bit ([[wikipedia:Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]]).
* As a result, the effects appear in the correct places even if the player is far away from the spawn point (with effects being the most extreme when over 16,777,216 blocks away).
* The following precision loss errors are fixed:
** [[Lava]] embers and popping sounds should now originate from the correct positions.<ref>{{bug|MC-167046}}</ref>
** [[Campfire]] embers should now be generated at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-167042}}</ref>
** Particles from [[rain]] hitting the top of blocks should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-1735}}</ref>
** Smoke emitted by lava during rain should appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-171037}}</ref>
** Smoke emitted by campfires during rain should appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-185480}}</ref>
** Particles from [[redstone dust]] should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-182748}}</ref>
** Particles from [[redstone repeater]]s should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-167971}}</ref>
** Particles from nether biomes should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-170872}}</ref>
** Particles from adding [[eyes of ender]] to [[end portal frame]]s should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-161969}}</ref>
** Particles dripping from [[leaves]] during rain no longer snap to block corners and are correctly randomized across the underside of the block.<ref>{{bug|MC-167091}}</ref>
** The book of the [[enchanting table]] now opens properly at high distances; previously there were cases where the player could be pressed right up to the block, yet the book would not acknowledge them.<ref>{{bug|MC-167044}}</ref>
** [[TNT]] ignited by other explosions now appears at the right locations at high distances.<ref>{{bug|MC-167047}}</ref>
** [[Detector rail]]s at high distances were not always being correctly powered and depowered, which has been fixed.<ref>{{bug|MC-183174}}</ref>
** Mob pathfinding caused mobs to randomly swivel at high distances.<ref>{{bug|MC-177723}}</ref>
** Mob spawning would also break down, spawning mobs at block corners and sometimes inside of other blocks.<ref>{{bug|MC-167103}}</ref>
** Generation of [[minecarts with chests]] in [[mineshaft]]s now spawns them at the intended positions.<ref>{{bug|MC-167421}}</ref>

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed sweet berry bushes from the <code>prevent_mob_spawning_inside</code> block tag.
* The <code>piglin_loved</code> item tag now uses the <code>gold_ores</code> item tag instead of listening gold ore and nether gold ore individually.
* Added [[gold nugget]]s to the <code>piglin_loved</code> item tag.
