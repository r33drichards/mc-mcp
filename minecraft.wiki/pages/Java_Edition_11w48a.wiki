'''11w48a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.1]], released on December 1, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|142250239871561729|I've been a little off lately, but here's the weekly Minecraft snapshot: assets.minecraft.net/11w48a/minecraft.jar  (+minecraft_server.jar)|December 1, 2011}}</ref> which modifies [[farmland]], [[apple]] drop chances, and [[void fog]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Farmland JE3 BE3.png|32px]] [[Farmland]]'''
* Farmland can now only be trampled if the [[player]] jumps/falls on it; [[walking]] no longer affects it.
* [[Mob]]s can similarly trample farmland by jumping on it, but not by walking.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Apple JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Apple]]s'''
* Now have a {{frac|1|200}} (0.5%)  chance of dropping from [[oak leaves]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Void fog]]'''
* Void fog has been removed in Creative mode.

'''{{BiomeLink|Taiga}}'''
* Changed temperature value from 0.3 to 0.05, making taigas generate with snow again.
