'''[[Chunk]]s''' store the terrain and entities within a 16×384×16 area in The [[Overworld]], and 16×256×16 in [[The Nether]] and [[The End]] by default. They also store precomputed lighting, heightmap data for Minecraft's performance, and other meta information.

== NBT structure ==
{{See also|Region file format|Anvil file format}}

Chunks are stored as tags in regional Minecraft Anvil files, which are named in the form {{code|r.x.z.mca}}. They are stored in [[NBT format]], with the following structure (updated for 1.18):
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag.
**{{nbt|int|DataVersion}}: Version of the chunk NBT structure.
**{{nbt|int|xPos}}: X position of the chunk (in absolute chunks from world {{cd|x|z|d=,}} origin, '''not''' relative to the region).
**{{nbt|int|zPos}}: Z position of the chunk (in absolute chunks from world {{cd|x|z|d=,}} origin, '''not''' relative to the region).
**{{nbt|int|yPos}}: Lowest Y section position in the chunk (e.g. {{cd|-4}} in 1.18).
**{{nbt|string|Status}}: Defines the world generation status of this chunk. It is always one of the following: {{code|minecraft:empty}}, {{code|minecraft:structure_starts}}, {{code|minecraft:structure_references}}, {{code|minecraft:biomes}}, {{code|minecraft:noise}}, {{code|minecraft:surface}}, {{code|minecraft:carvers}}/{{Code|minecraft:liquid_carvers}}, {{code|minecraft:features}}, {{code|minecraft:light}}/{{Code|minecraft:initialize_light}}, {{code|minecraft:spawn}}, or {{code|minecraft:full}}. All status except {{code|minecraft:full}} are used for chunks called ''proto-chunks'', in other words, for chunks with incomplete generation.
**{{nbt|long|LastUpdate}}: Tick when the chunk was last saved.
**{{nbt|list|sections}}: List of {{nbt|compound|Compounds}}, each tag is a section (also known as sub-chunk). All sections in the world's height are present in this list, even those who are empty (filled with air).
***{{nbt|compound}} An individual section.
****{{nbt|byte|Y}}: The Y position of this section.
****{{nbt|compound|block_states}}
*****{{nbt|list|palette}}: Set of different block states used in this particular section. The vanilla implementation never includes any unused entries upon writing, so this array will never contain more than 4096 entries, and the indices in the data array will be at most 12 bits long. However the vanilla implementation is also able to handle larger palettes when reading.
******{{nbt|compound}} A block
*******{{nbt|string|Name}}: Block [[resource location]]
*******{{nbt|compound|Properties}}: List of [[block state]] properties, with {{cd|name}} being the name of the block state property
********{{nbt|string|''Name''}}: The block state's name and its value.
*****{{nbt|long-array|data}}: A packed array of 4096 indices pointing to the palette, stored in an array of 64-bit integers ({{nbt|long|Longs}}).
******If only one block state is present in the palette, this field is not required and the block fills the whole section.
******All indices are the same length. This length is set to the minimum amount of bits required to represent the largest index in the palette, and then set to a minimum size of 4 bits. Since 1.16, the indices are not packed across multiple elements of the array, meaning that if there is no more space in a given 64-bit integer for the whole next index, it starts instead at the first (lowest) bit of the next 64-bit integer. Different sections of a chunk can have different lengths for the indices.
****{{nbt|compound|biomes}}
*****{{nbt|list|palette}}: Set of different biomes used in this particular section. The vanilla implementation never includes any unused entries upon writing, so this array will never contain more than 64 entries, and the indices in the data array will be at most 6 bits long. However the vanilla implementation is also able to handle larger palettes when reading.
******{{nbt|string|Name}}: Biome [[resource location]]
*****{{nbt|long-array|data}}: A packed array of 64 indices pointing to the palette, stored in an array of 64-bit integers ({{nbt|long|Longs}}).
******Biomes in a world are stored in cells of 4×4×4 blocks, and only store 64 individual entries. Biomes at the block level are smoothed based on the cells.{{Info needed}}
******If only one biome is present in the palette, this field is not required and the biome fills the whole section.
******All indices are the same length: the minimum amount of bits required to represent the largest index in the palette. These indices do not have a minimum size. As with block states, the indices are not packed across multiple elements of the array. Different sections of a chunk can have different lengths for the indices.
****{{nbt|byte-array|BlockLight}}: 2048 {{nbt|byte|Bytes}} stores the amount of block-emitted light in each block. Makes load times faster compared to recomputing at load time. Omitted if no light reaches this section of the chunk. Light level is stored as 4 bits per block, 2 blocks sharing a byte: starting at 0, even blocks take the first nibble, and odd blocks the second one. 
****{{nbt|byte-array|SkyLight}}: 2048 {{nbt|byte|Bytes}} stores the maximum sky light that reaches each block, regardless of current time. If the sky light data for a section is omitted you should look at the light data of the section directly above it. Take the 16x16 layer at the bottom of that section and repeat that light data 16 times to recompute the data for the omitted section. If there is no section above the current one, you are at the top section of the chunk. The light data for this top section should be set as completely bright (<code>0xF</code> for each block). The format of how these levels is stored is the same as for BlockLight.
**{{nbt|list|block_entities}}: Each {{nbt|compound|Compound}} in this list defines a block entity in the chunk.
***See [[Block entity format]].
**{{nbt|compound|CarvingMasks}}: Only for ''proto-chunks'' '''(not confirmed for 1.18 format)'''.
***{{nbt|byte-array|AIR}}: A series of bits indicating whether a cave has been dug at a specific position, stored in a byte array.
***{{nbt|byte-array|LIQUID}}: A series of bits indicating whether an underwater cave has been dug at a specific position, stored in a byte array.
**{{nbt|compound|Heightmaps}}: Several different [[heightmap]]s corresponding to 256 values compacted at 9 bits per value (lowest being 0, highest being 384, both values inclusive). The 9-bit values are stored in an array of 37 {{nbt|long|Longs}}, each containing 7 values ({{nbt|long|A Long}} = 64 bits, 7×9 = 63; the last bit is unused). In versions prior to 1.16 the heightmaps were stored in 36 {{nbt|long|Long}} values, where the bits were arranged in an uninterrupted "stream" across all values, resulting in all 2304 bits being used. The 9-bit values are unsigned, and indicate the amount of blocks above the bottom of the world. This means that converting a world to 1.18 adds 64 to every value.
***{{nbt|long-array|MOTION_BLOCKING}}
***{{nbt|long-array|MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES}}
***{{nbt|long-array|OCEAN_FLOOR}}
***{{nbt|long-array|OCEAN_FLOOR_WG}}
***{{nbt|long-array|WORLD_SURFACE}}
***{{nbt|long-array|WORLD_SURFACE_WG}}
**{{nbt|list|Lights}}: A List of 16 lists that store positions of light sources per chunk section as shorts, only for ''proto-chunks'' '''(not confirmed for 1.18 format)'''.
**{{nbt|list|Entities}}: A list of entities in the ''proto-chunks'', used when generating. As of 1.17, this list is not present for fully generated chunks and entities are moved to a separated region files once the chunk is generated, see [[Entity format#Entity Format|Entity format]] for more details '''(not confirmed for 1.18 format)'''.
***{{nbt|compound}}: An entity.
**{{nbt|list|fluid_ticks}}: A list of {{nbt|compound|Compounds}}
***Each {{nbt|compound|Compound}} in this list is an "active" liquid in this chunk waiting to be updated. See [[#Tile tick format|Tile Tick Format]] below.
**{{nbt|list|block_ticks}}: A list of {{nbt|compound|Compounds}}
***Each {{nbt|compound|Compound}} in this list is an "active" block in this chunk waiting to be updated. These are used to save the state of redstone machines or falling sand, and other activity. See [[#Tile tick format|Tile Tick Format]] below.
**{{nbt|long|InhabitedTime}}: The cumulative number of ticks players have been in this chunk. Note that this value increases faster when more players are in the chunk. Used for [[Difficulty#Regional difficulty|Regional Difficulty]].
**{{nbt|compound|blending_data}}: This appears to be biome blending data, although more testing is needed to confirm. {{More_info}}
***{{nbt|int|min_section}}: This appears to be the lowest chunk section the chunk has. {{More_info}}
***{{nbt|int|max_section}}: This appears to be the highest chunk section the chunk has. {{More_info}}
**{{nbt|list|PostProcessing}}: A List of 24 {{nbt|list|Lists}} that store the positions of blocks that need to receive an update when a ''proto-chunk'' turns into a full chunk, packed in {{nbt|short|Shorts}}. Each list corresponds to specific section in the height of the chunk.
***See [[#ToBeTicked format|ToBeTicked format]] below for a description of the coordinate packing format. A common use case for this to is make liquids flow after generating a source block, such as springs in caves.
**{{nbt|compound|structures}}: Structure data in this chunk.
***{{nbt|compound|references}}: Coordinates of chunks that contain ''starts''.
****{{nbt|long-array|''Structure Name''}}: Each 64-bit number of this array represents a chunk coordinate (i.e. block coordinate / 16), with its X packed into the low (least significant) 32 bits and Z packed into the high (most significant) 32 bits.
***{{nbt|compound|starts}}: Structures that are yet to be generated, stored by general type. Some parts of the structures may have already been generated. Completely generated structures are ''removed'' by setting their ''id'' to "{{cd|INVALID}}" and removing all other tags.
****{{nbt|compound|''Structure Name''}}: Only the structures that can spawn in this dimension are stored, for example, EndCity is stored only in the end chunks.
*****{{nbt|list|Children}}: List of structure pieces making up this structure, that were not generated yet. Absent if id is {{cd|INVALID}}.

== Block format ==
In the Anvil format, block positions are ordered YZX for compression purposes.

The coordinate system is as follows:
* '''X''' increases East, decreases West
* '''Y''' increases upward, decreases downward
* '''Z''' increases South, decreases North

This means indices are ordered like in a book, with its top to the North, read from beneath and with words written backward: each letter is a different X-index, each line a Z-index, and each page a Y-index. In case of a flat 2D array, the Y-index is omitted, and the array reads like a single page.


Each section is a 16×16×16-block area, with up to 16 sections in a chunk : from 0 at the bottom, to 15 on top. Empty sections are not saved. Each section has a "Y" byte for its Y-index (0 to 15), a "Palette" list linking IDs to block states, and a "BlockStates" long array storing the IDs per block location, compressed by fitting multiple IDs inside each entry (see [[Chunk_format#NBT_structure|NBT_structure]] above for details on the compression). There might be an additional section at the top and or bottom of the world used to store light, so that light travels properly over and under the world limits.

The pseudo-code below shows how to access individual block information from a single section.

<pre>
byte Nibble4(byte[] arr, int index){
	return index%2 == 0 ? arr[index/2]&0x0F : (arr[index/2]>>4)&0x0F;
}
int BlockPos = y*16*16 + z*16 + x; 
compound Block = Palette[change_array_element_size(BlockStates,Log2(length(Palette)))[BlockPos]];
string BlockName = Block.Name; 
compound BlockState = Block.Properties; 
byte Blocklight = Nibble4(BlockLight, BlockPos); 
byte Skylight = Nibble4(SkyLight, BlockPos);
</pre>

== Tile tick format ==
Tile Ticks represent block updates that need to happen because they could not happen before the chunk was saved. Examples reasons for tile ticks include redstone circuits needing to continue updating, water and lava that should continue flowing, recently placed sand or gravel that should fall, etc. Tile ticks are not used for purposes such as leaf decay, where the decay information is stored in the leaf block data values and handled by Minecraft when the chunk loads. For map makers, tile ticks can be used to update blocks after a period of time has passed with the chunk loaded into memory.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} A Tile Tick <section begin="tile tick format" />
** {{nbt|string|i}}: The ID of the block; used to activate the correct block update procedure.
** {{nbt|int|p}}: If multiple tile ticks are scheduled for the same tick, tile ticks with lower p are processed first. If they also have the same p, the order is unknown.
** {{nbt|int|t}}: The number of ticks until processing should occur. May be negative when processing is overdue.
** {{nbt|int|x}}: X position
** {{nbt|int|y}}: Y position
** {{nbt|int|z}}: Z position <section end="tile tick format" />
</div>

== ToBeTicked format ==
This {{nbt|list|List}} is always present, and contains 16 {{nbt|list|Sublists}}, each representing one of the "sections" of the chunk. Those inside lists may contain {{nbt|short|Shorts}}, each representing a packed coordinate relative to the section : The 4 most significant bits are always 0, then each group of 4 bits (or nibble) represents a section-relative coordinate, from 0 to 15. The order of sections in the list appear to be ordered from bottom to top, and the packing order of the coordinates is {{cd|0ZYX}}, where {{cd|0}} refers to the chunk section. When converting ''proto-chunks'' to full chunks, only coordinates that are stored in PostProcessing appear to receive a tick update, tick updates stored in {{cd|block_ticks|fluid_ticks|d=and}} are ignored. {{verify|Further testing needed for confirmation.}}
