== Changes ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Projectile]]s'''
* Changed scaling.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Target selectors]]'''
* Changed handling of <code>r=</code> in entity selectors.
** Now based on the position of the entity and not on the center of the block anymore - meaning that <code>r=0</code> only selects entities at the exact same position.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Traveling'''
* Made [[player]]s invulnerable during [[dimension]] changes.

== Fixes ==
