This page documents textures that are, or once were, present in Minecraft but are not actually used.

Specifically, only textures that were ''fully unused'' are included here. Textures that were previously used for a feature in older versions are not listed, nor are textures that later became used in a future update—even if the texture was updated before being used. Examples include cobwebs, crying obsidian, calibrated sculk sensors, the original end stone texture, the original two sandstone texture variants, and the pigman (which was later retconned into the piglin). Unused duplicate textures are generally not listed unless they are tied to another unused texture or were changed later on.

A more quantitative, but less analytical, list of unused textures of varying levels of notability can be found here.

=== Removed ===

==== Classic white texture ====
In the versions of <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> used between [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.14a|0.0.14a]] and [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.14a_08|0.0.14a_08]] there is a white texture which was not used in any in-game block. It may have been an early experimental [[snow]] texture, as [[Notch]] had stated interest in adding snow and ice before this point,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20090529032513/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/110593679/winter-is-an-awesome-idea-i-can-see-snow-and-tiles</ref> or it could relate to clouds, as they were added in the same version. This texture was removed from <samp>terrain.png</samp> in [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.15a (Multiplayer Test 1)|0.0.15a]].

==== Chair textures ====
From [[Java Edition Indev 20100206-2034|Indev 20100206-2034]] to [[Java Edition Infdev 20100627|Infdev 20100627]] two textures were present in <samp>terrain.png</samp> which were based off of the [[oak planks]] texture. The first texture is commonly recognized to be the side view of a chair, and the other texture is often interpreted as being either the front view of a chair or the side view of a table, although the latter was never mentioned by Notch and as such this interpretation remains speculative.

Indev 20100206-2034 also added a duplicate oak planks texture. This may have been intended to be used for such blocks as well (as the back or seat portion), or it may have simply been the texture copied for the other two textures to be cut from. This was removed earlier than the other two textures in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100607|Infdev 20100607]].

In [[Java Edition Infdev 20100618|Infdev 20100618]], the chair texture specifically changed to be slightly darker. The [[door]] and [[ladder]] textures, which were relatively close to it on <samp>terrain.png</samp>, were also darkened in that version, and the second texture remained completely untouched.

During the period of time where these textures existed in <samp>terrain.png</samp>, Notch made multiple statements of plans to implement chairs,<ref>[[wordofnotch:659506746|"Asynchronous saving and loading, and slightly more complex save files"]] – The Word of Notch, June 3, 2010</ref><ref>[[wordofnotch:666612436|"I got my Pandora yesterday"]] – The Word of Notch, June 5, 2010</ref> alongside mentions of other furniture (like doors, signs and ladders).<ref>[[wordofnotch:660061390|"Lo and behold, now I need larger blocks"]] – The Word of Notch, June 3, 2010</ref><ref>[[wordofnotch:673782427|"Finally, an update"]] – The Word of Notch, June 7, 2010</ref>

Intriguingly, these textures were added in the exact same version as [[wheat crop]]s and farming mechanics were. Crops of invalid data values (8 and beyond, as wheat normally only grows to 7) would overflow to the next line of <samp>terrain.png</samp>, due to how wheat models and texture selection were defined at the time. Data values 11 and 12 specifically happened to use the exact spots where these two textures were positioned, resulting in wheat with these data values appearing as rather broken chairs.

</gallery>

Mojang have since rejected the idea of adding "furniture" blocks to the game, as their existence would "inhibit natural creativity".<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360005029872-Previously-Considered-Suggestions</ref>

==== Coral block texture ====
In [[Java Edition Infdev 20100629|Infdev 20100629]], a [[coral block]] texture was added to <samp>terrain.png</samp>. It was composed of several transparent, black, white and various shades of gray pixels. It was removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.4|Alpha v1.0.4]] with its position being taken by the snowy [[grass block]] side texture.

Around the same time the texture was added to <samp>terrain.png</samp>, Notch mentioned an attempt to add coral blocks to the game, according to a post on The Word of Notch documenting a failed attempt to draw a realistic-looking coral block texture.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130104104219/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/746938105/the-server-is-back-up</ref> The texture's hyperbolic appearance resembles early iterations of coral blocks showcased at Minecon in 2017.

Unused code for coral blocks was found in [[Java Edition Beta 1.2_02 (20110517)|a development build of Beta 1.2_02]], allowing randomly colored coral blocks to be created in-game. While the remaining code does not specify which spot in <samp>terrain.png</samp> corals would have used, the random coloring implies it would have been a grayscale texture such as this one.

==== Grass block top texture duplicate ====
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3|Beta 1.6 Test Build 3]], a duplicate of the grass block top texture was added to <samp>terrain.png</samp>. This version also added [[grass]] and [[fern]]s, which appear adjacent to this texture.

Interestingly, in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5|Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5]], despite being completely unused in-game, this texture was actually changed alongside other block textures that changed in this version. The actually used grass block texture also changed in this version, however despite both textures being identical beforehand, the Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5 textures made the two textures visually distinct from each other.

The <samp>terrain.png</samp> used in [[Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha]], being based off of the <samp>terrain.png</samp> from [[Java Edition 1.0.0]], also includes this texture. It was also present in ''Xbox 360 Edition'' since its inception, due to initially being based on [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]].

The texture was eventually removed from ''Java Edition'' in [[Java Edition 13w02a|13w02a]] and ''Pocket Edition'' in [[Pocket Edition v0.8.0 alpha build 2|v0.8.0 alpha build 2]] due to the deprecation of <samp>terrain.png</samp> in those versions. It was removed from ''Xbox 360 Edition'' in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU12|TU12]] due to being replaced by the vertical [[dispenser]] texture, although it still technically persists in the base game as the original <samp>terrain.png</samp> was never removed, despite never being used in TU3 onward.

==== "Footprints" texture ====
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release|Beta 1.8 Pre-release]], a texture possibly composed of three footprints was added to <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp>. Its intended use is unknown. The texture was eventually removed in [[Java Edition 13w03a|13w03a]] due to <samp>terrain.png</samp>'s deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and <samp>results.png</samp>.

This texture also carried on to ''Pocket Edition'' in v0.2.0 alpha due to the <samp>terrain.png</samp> used then being based off of the one from ''Java Edition'' 1.0.0, before its removal in v0.8.0 alpha build 2.

The texture was also present in ''Xbox 360 Edition'' since [[Xbox 360 Edition TU0|TU0]] due to said version including a copy of [[Java Edition 1.2]]'s <samp>terrain.png</samp>. It was re-replaced by a [[Placeholder texture#Texture atlas blank spaces|lilac placeholder texture]] in TU12.

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Unknown 3 (texture) JE1 BE1.png|160px]]}}
</div>

{{-}}

==== "Village border" ====
These textures, also added to <samp>terrain.png</samp> in Beta 1.8 Pre-release, remained unused and were removed in 13w03a per <samp>terrain.png</samp>'s deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and <samp>results.png</samp>. These textures were said to have been used to mark the edges of [[village]]s as seen in the [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]] PAX demo,<ref>2013 TCRF page revision: https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Minecraft:_Java_Edition/Unused_Graphics&oldid=158074#Village_Border</ref> however footage of these textures in action does not seem to exist.

The "edge" texture was carried to ''Pocket Edition'' in v0.2.0 alpha, however the "corner" texture was not, as its place was taken up by the [[info_update]] texture. The "edge" was removed in v0.8.0 alpha build 2 alongside many other such textures.

Both textures were present in ''Xbox 360 Edition'' since TU0 due to said version including a copy of ''Java Edition'' 1.2's <samp>terrain.png</samp>. In TU12, the "edge" was replaced by the bottom texture of the [[block of quartz]] (later known as the [[smooth quartz]] texture), and the "corner" by the top texture of the [[hopper]].

==== Beta/Release white texture ====
The last of four unused textures added in Beta 1.8 Pre-release, this white texture was located alongside the three others. Its use is also unknown (potentially, it could be meant to be a "snowy" overlay for [[sapling]]s), and was removed in 13w02a per <samp>terrain.png</samp>'s deprecation in 13w02a and the subsequent removal of it and <samp>results.png</samp>.

This texture never appeared in ''Pocket Edition'' Alpha, as its position was taken by the texture for [[info_update2]].

The texture was present in ''Xbox 360 Edition'' since TU0 due to said version including a copy of ''Java Edition'' 1.2's <samp>terrain.png</samp>. It was re-replaced by a lilac placeholder texture in TU12.

==== Paeonia ====
The [[paeonia]] was a [[flower]] type originally planned for implementation in [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]]. Originally revealed by [[Jeb]] in a screenshot,<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/dE8ljlJMLb/ "I've been adding a bunch of new flowers to #minecraft. One of them is the pink Paeonia, as it was the main flower for our wedding"] – [https://www.instagram.com/jebkhaile/ @jebkhaile], August 16, 2013</ref> the flower was never implemented, being superseded by the [[peony]].

<div style="text-align:center">
<gallery>

</div>

However, the texture for the paeonia was still added to the game's texture files in [[Java Edition 13w36a|13w36a]] as <samp>flower_paeonia.png</samp>, alongside all the actually implemented flowers. This texture persisted in the files for over four years, eventually being removed in [[Java Edition 17w47a|17w47a]] without a doubt due to resource changes and [[the Flattening]].

Interestingly, despite the texture being completely unused throughout its presence in the game files, paeonias were redone in the [[Texture Update]] beta packs. The texture is present in the {{BE}} default resource pack, having been added along with the other texture update textures.

==== Barrel variants ====
In a [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.9.0.0|beta 1.9.0.0]] resource pack template, two subsequently unused [[barrel]] textures were added, though it is uncertain if they were ever in any releases.{{verify}}<ref name="RPTemplate">https://web.archive.org/web/20190105195053/https://meedownloads.blob.core.windows.net/worlds/Vanilla_Resource_Pack_Beta_1.9.0.zip</ref> The "empty" texture visually resembles the later-introduced open texture. What these textures were specifically intended for remains unknown.

==== Wax block ====
A texture for a wax block was added to the game files in [[Java Edition 19w34a|19w34a]]. This texture was removed in [[Java Edition 19w42a|19w42a]], as it was never actually intended to be used.<ref name="CancelledApiculture">https://twitter.com/cojomax99/status/1183761380228452355</ref>

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Wax Block (texture) JE1.png|160px]]}}

As this was a lone texture, it is implied that it would simply be rendered as a full cube:

==== Root vines ====
In [[Java Edition 21w05a]], this texture called <samp>root_vines_head.png</samp> was added to the <samp>assets/minecraft/textures/block/</samp> directory. This was an early design for [[cave vines]].<ref>{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1464675027228442626|root_vines_head.png was just a prototype texture that we forgot to remove :) Was a placeholder for glowberry vines|November 27, 2021}}</ref> There is no known "body" texture despite this being implied by this texture being named "head" alongside the naming of existing cave vines.

=== Unused ===
==== <samp>debug.png</samp> and <samp>debug2.png</samp> ====
In [[Java Edition 15w31a|15w31a]], these two textures were added to the game, where they remain to the current day. Given their name, they are used for debugging purposes by Mojang. It appears that there are the letters N, E, S, and W on the texture of debug2, all placed at different rotations. This could possibly be used for rendering, with the letters signifying the 4 cardinal directions. 

<samp>debug.png</samp> could be made to appear in-game in certain [[Java Edition 1.13]] snapshots due to being defined as the particle texture for [[bubble column]]s, meaning actions that would result in the creation of particles (such as falling from a height onto the edge of a block next to a bubble column) would show particles with this texture. They could also be seen when the bubble column was pushed by a [[piston]].<ref>{{bug|MC-125280}}</ref>

==== Studded armor ====
[[File:Studded armor possible render.png|thumb|A speculative render of what Studded Armor could have looked like]]
[[Studded armor]] refers to four [[armor]] item textures which were found in the initial versions of <samp>[[items.png]]</samp>, alongside the leather armor, chain armor and plate (iron) armor sets. First appearing in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091231-2255|the second December 31, 2009 build]], the sprites technically did see use in-game, but this is of little significance as all sprites on <samp>items.png</samp> were used at the time, with basically no functionality. These textures were taken directly from one of [[Notch|Notch's]] games ''[[Legend of the Chambered 2]]''.

<div style="text-align:center">

Studded Chestplate (item) JE1.png|Chestplate

</div>

The textures were ultimately removed some time between [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100204-1541|the 4th]] and [[Java Edition Indev 20100206-2034|6th of February, 2010]] in preparation for the actual implementation of armor and its mechanics.

{{-}}

==== Quiver ====
The [[quiver]] was another item texture which existed in <samp>items.png</samp> from [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091231-2255]], but which persisted for much longer. Having its origins in [[Legend of the Chambered]], one of Notch's prior games, the texture was also included among the first item sprites in the game. While it too technically existed as an item, it was also ultimately nonfunctional and only existed for testing purposes.

Its texture was changed [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100122|on the 22nd of January, 2010]] by flipping it horizontally from its original orientation.

<div style="text-align:center">
<gallery>
Quiver JE1.png|Original texture

</gallery>
</div>

The texture remained in <samp>items.png</samp> for as long as <samp>items.png</samp> itself existed, and even outlived it, becoming an individual file in [[13w02a]] with <samp>items.png</samp>'s splitting, and still not being removed in [[Java Edition 13w24a|13w24a]] with the advent of [[resource pack]]s despite many other unused textures being deleted.

Despite the quiver texture continuing to exist in the game unused, [[Jeb]] stated in 2011 he would not add quivers to the game as an item.<ref>[[User talk:Jeb mojang#Quiver|"No"]] – [[user:Jeb mojang|Jeb]], April 24, 2011</ref>

During the development of [[Java Edition 1.9]], [[Dinnerbone]] posted a 2×204960 image on Twitter<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|595224755126534144|The following picture is meaningless and is probably not even worth your time clicking on it.|May 4, 2015}}</ref> which could be reformed into a 854×480 Minecraft screenshot, clearly depicting the quiver as a usable item in the inventory, where it had what seemed to be a dedicated slot alongside a slot for [[arrow]]s.<ref>{{reddit|34too2/nathan_adams_on_twitter_the_following_picture_is|cqxxz2i|context=0|It's not meaningless.|FiredPlayer (now deleted)|May 4, 2015}}</ref> He shared another screenshot of the quiver in the inventory a few weeks later, with the quiver slot in a different location.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|601714812436029440|I also had to rearrange the Creative inventory a little, too, to make the new slots fit. I don't think it's too bad.|May 22, 2015}}</ref> On June 30, 2015, Dinnerbone stated that he scrapped quivers as he felt that holding arrows in the off-hand felt "more natural."<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|615853908553019393|I'm removing quivers again.

</div>

As a result of this scrapping, with there no longer being any planned future uses for the texture, it was ultimately removed from Java Edition in 1.9's first snapshot: [[Java Edition 15w31a|15w31a]].

The quiver texture was also present in ''Pocket Edition''{{'}}s <samp>items.png</samp> file from the beginning and, reflecting the behavior of early Indev, was even unintentionally assigned to an invalid ID item.{{info needed|I definitely remember this being the case, but confirmation is needed}} It remained part of Items.png and its successor [[Items-opaque.tga]] until the texture atlas was replaced with invidual item textures. It was removed at an unknown time but later re-added,{{verify}} and is still present in ''Bedrock Edition''{{'}}s vanilla resource pack. It was also present in the Legacy Console Edition from the start, being replaced by the [[end crystal]] item texture in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU43|TU43]] and equivalent versions. The texture is also present in every version of ''Pi Edition''.

==== Unused camera item texture ====
Prior to the addition of [[camera]]s in [[Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha]], an unused item texture resembling a handheld camera existed next to the texture for the actual [[camera]] entity. It would be replaced by a [[Music Disc blocks|"blocks" music disc]] texture with the full addition of the camera.

==== Ruby ====
[[Rubies]] were intended to be the original currency used for [[trading]]. They could be seen in a screenshot released by Jeb on 21 May 2012,<ref>https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/204619936616808451</ref> in which the trading system was first being tested. While it was later decided that [[emerald]]s would take their place as a currency, a ruby texture was still in [[Java Edition 12w21a]]'s <samp>items.png</samp> file alongside the emerald. The unused ruby texture which was present in the game differed from the version shown in the screenshot, however; both versions of the texture are shown below for the sake of comparison.

<div style="text-align:center">

</div>

Alongside emeralds, 12w21a also implemented [[emerald ore]] as a method of obtaining them. However, the texture used for emerald ore was accidentally set to a texture seemingly intended for ruby ore,<ref>https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/205641953742819328</ref> and translation strings in the game's language files included references to rubies and ruby ore:
* <code>item.ruby.name=Ruby</code>
* <code>tile.oreRuby.name=Ruby Ore</code>

[[Java Edition 12w21b]] was swiftly released to give emerald ore its intended release texture, and the translation strings were removed in the full release of [[Java Edition 1.10]].

<div style="text-align:center">
<gallery>

</div>

Emeralds were decided upon over rubies as [[Dinnerbone]] stated he had red-green color blindness, and had difficulty distinguishing between ruby ore and [[redstone ore]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217030931/http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1621716-15-new-blocksitems/#entry19977082|title=We actually didn't go with rubies and changed to emeralds at last minute for the villager trading because I'm colour blind and couldn't easily spot the difference between the ruby ore and redstone ore until I was up close.|author=Dinnerbone|website=[[Minecraft Forum]]|date=December 29, 2012}}</ref>

Despite being completely unused throughout its existence in the game files, it, like the quiver, inexplicably survived the splitting of <samp>items.png</samp> and remained in the game as an unused texture file for much longer than expected. It even beat the quiver in longevity, remaining unused in the game for close to a decade prior to its removal in [[Java Edition 21w13a]].<ref name="UnusedFiles">{{bug|MC-108636}}</ref>

The texture was added to ''Pocket Edition'' in [[Pocket Edition v0.8.0 alpha build 2]]. It was eventually removed in [[Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1|the first v0.14.0 build]], but later re-added and is still present in the vanilla resource pack. The texture was also added to ''Xbox 360 Edition'' in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU9|TU9]], and remained in the console editions until [[Xbox 360 Edition TU54|TU54]] and equivalent versions, in which it was replaced by one of the textures used for [[bed]] items.

[[mce:Ruby|The name "Ruby" was reused for a currency]] in the now-discontinued game ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'', using completely different textures from those present in the main game.

Rubies were reimplemented as a joke feature in [[23w13a_or_b]] snapshot, where they could replace the [[Emerald]] item model via a specific vote.

==== Banner item textures ====
During the [[Java Edition 1.8]] snapshots, starting with [[Java Edition 14w30a]], there were two unused item textures, "banner_base" and "banner_overlay", probably intended to be used together as a recolorable inventory icon for [[banner]]s. The texture for "banner_base" was removed in [[16w41a]] and the texture "banner_overlay" was removed in [[17w47a]].

A texture for a crystallized honey item was added to the game files in [[Java Edition 19w34a|19w34a]]. This texture was removed in [[Java Edition 19w42a|19w42a]], as it was never actually intended to be used.<ref name="CancelledApiculture"/>

==== Unused potions ====
{{BE}} has unused [[potion]] textures for many [[effect]]s, along with their [[splash potion|splash]] variants. These effects are: [[Absorption]], [[Blindness]], [[Haste]], [[Health Boost]], [[Hunger]], [[Mining Fatigue]], [[Nausea]], [[Resistance]], [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]], and [[Levitation]], as well as the [[Luck]] potion textures also present {{in|JE}}. These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha]], except for the potion of levitation, which was added in [[Pocket Edition 1.0.0]]. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the [[texture update]] in [[Bedrock Edition 1.10.0]]. Strangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.

The texture is mostly identical to that of [[Steve]], with the main difference being another layer of hair being present in the hat layer. Two potentially misplaced yellow pixels also appear on the head. It was removed [[Java Edition Indev 20100214-2|two days later]].

==== Door entity ====
{{info needed section|File is dated about 4 hours earlier than terrain.png in inf-20100607}}
On 3 June 2010, Notch discussed on his blog plans to add different types of furniture to the game, which included [[door]]s. These postings include discussions of implementing said furniture in the form of entities as opposed to blocks, as was previously done for [[painting]]s in Indev, with Notch also stating his successful reimplementation of [[sign]]s the previous day<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210118183930/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/659506746/asynchronous-saving-and-loading-and-slightly-more</ref> as a [[block entity]].<ref name="doors2">https://web.archive.org/web/20210225110701/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/660061390/lo-and-behold-now-i-need-larger-blocks</ref> If implemented as a block entity, this would allow doors to have a smooth opening and closing animation,<ref name="doors2" /> similarly to what was added for [[chest]]s a bit over a year later by converting them from normal blocks.

Doors were ultimately added [[Java Edition Infdev 20100607|on the 7th of June, 2010]], as a relatively normal block, which would instantly open or close when interacted with, having no continuous animation in the process as had been mentioned. However, the <samp>/item</samp> directory in <samp>[[minecraft.jar]]</samp>, which stored the textures for other non-mob entities at that time such as [[minecart]]s and [[arrow]]s, gained a texture called <samp>door.png</samp> in this same version, which is without a doubt linked to said opening/closing animation. An early iteration of the oak door can be seen in it, with empty space filled out in solid purple in a fashion resembling the [[Placeholder texture#Texture atlas blank spaces|placeholder texture from <samp>terrain.png</samp> and <samp>kz.png</samp>]] as well as the checkerboard [[missing texture]].

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Door (texture) JE1.png|320px|class=pixel-image]]}}
</div>

An interesting thing to note about this door texture is the absence of any windows, a significant difference from the door actually implemented in the June 7th Infdev build, the top half of which does have a transparent window. The item form, however, still did not have a window in it until [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.1|Alpha v1.0.1]].

<div style="text-align:center">

This door entity texture was one of many unused textures removed in 13w24a with the reconfiguring of game assets and the introduction of resource packs as the successor to texture packs.

{{-}}

==== <samp>villager.png</samp> ====
[[Villager]]s were added to ''Java Edition'' in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease|the first Beta 1.9 prerelease]], with their textures located together in a dedicated subfolder of the mob textures folder: <samp>/mob/villager</samp>. However, another texture was added in this version, called <samp>villager.png</samp>, which is directly in the mob folder itself rather than the villager subfolder. (It is not to be confused with the "generic" file also called <samp>villager.png</samp> which is located in the villager subfolder, which was later used for [[nitwit]]s.) This texture is completely unused, and closely resembles Steve, but with significant modifications to fit a different entity model.

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Villager (texture) JE1.png|320px|class=pixel-image]]}}
</div>

If this texture is applied to a villager through use of a custom texture pack, the overall appearance is glitchy, implying that the model it was intended to be used for had changed since, and was eventually developed into the villager model that was actually released.

Along with many other unused textures, <samp>villager.png</samp> was removed in 13w24a when texture packs were succeeded by resource packs.

{{-}}

==== Villager, vindicator, evoker, and witch hood ====
[[File:Witch in 18w50a.png|thumb|Witch hood seen on [[18w50a]].|213px]]
[[File:MEET THE EVOKER.png|thumb|Evoker hood seen on Meet the Evoker.|211x211px]]

[[Evoker]]s, [[vindicator]]s and [[witch]]es are hostile [[mob]]s based off the [[villager]]s, and they have an unused hood texture.

The evoker hood can be seen in the [[minecraft.net]] article "[https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-evoker Meet the Evoker]" and the witch hood can be seen in [[18w50a]].

Prior to the [[Village & Pillage]] update, the villagers also had unused hood textures.

The hoods on the evokers, vindicators, and witches were removed in [[Java Edition 1.18 Pre-release 5]].<ref>{{bug|MC-162038}}</ref>

{{-}}

==== Early ender dragon textures ====
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4]], two unused [[ender dragon]] textures, titled "body" and "dragon", were added, probably left over from an earlier phase in development, as they resemble other pre-release ender dragon textures that Notch shared on twitter. They were removed in [[Java Edition 1.6.1]].

==== Skis ====
In [[Java Edition 12w50a|12w50a]], a snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.4.6]], a texture named <samp>skis.png</samp> was added to the game. 1.4.6 was released close to Christmas of 2012. The texture was never actually intended to be used, and instead added by Dinnerbone as a [[wikipedia:red herring|red herring]].<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|283392354851901440|Bingo.|December 24, 2012}}</ref> 

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Skis (texture) JE1.png|64px|class=pixel-image]]}}
</div>

Like many other unused textures, it was removed in 13w24a with the switch to resource packs. The texture was once again reimplemented as a joke feature in [[Java Edition 23w13a or b|23w13a_or_b]].

In the ''Bedrock Edition''{{'}}s vanilla resource pack, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby [[cat]] exists. However, it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.

=== Removed ===

==== Footprint particle ====
{{See also|Particles}}
The particle itself was removed in snapshot [[17w47a]], and the texture file was removed in snapshot [[Java Edition 21w13a|21w13a]].<ref>{{bug|MC-108636}}</ref>

[[File:Particle footstep.png|thumb|Footstep particles on sand.]]

The footstep [[particle]] was introduced, but never used in-game. It was removed in snapshot [[Java Edition 17w47a|17w47a]], as part of ''[[The Flattening]]''. They were later added as an easter egg item in the [[Java Edition 20w14∞|20w14∞]] April Fools snapshot with the [[resource location]] <code>minecraft:footprint</code>. It could be obtained in the "missing" dimension or using the {{cmd|give}} command. The particle itself was readded in [[Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime|22w13oneblockatatime]], which is spawned when the player walks around. It was once again readded in [[Java Edition 24w14potato|24w14potato]] which is shown when the player has the Sticky effect and walks around.

{{-}}

==== Light blue particles ====
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.4|Beta 1.4]], two blue particles were added to <samp>[[particles.png]]</samp> of completely unknown use. They visually resemble water droplets, possibly implying early plans to add the water dripping event later added in 1.0.0, or a change to existing water splash effects. These particle textures were eventually removed in [[Java Edition 19w06a|19w06a]] due to the splitting of <samp>particles.png</samp> into its constituent textures, with unused particle textures being removed outright.

The textures were also added to ''Pocket Edition'' in v0.1.0 alpha due to its <samp>particles.png</samp> being the same as the version from Beta 1.4. It existed in ''Bedrock Edition'' up to release 1.16.

==== Angry villager head ====
In [[Java Edition 12w34a|12w34a]], a texture resembling an angry-looking [[villager]] head was added to <samp>particles.png</samp>. However, it remained unused. This texture was also removed in 19w06a due to being unused.

This unused texture was added to ''Pocket Edition'' in [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha build 1|v0.12.1 alpha build 1]] due to it changing to use a <samp>particles.png</samp> based on the one from 12w34a. It still exists in ''Bedrock Edition''{{'}}s <samp>particles.png</samp> as of 1.16.

==== Elephant toothpaste ====
{{info needed section|Was this experiment also shown off at one of the minecon livestreams? Likely worth mentioning}}
An unused particle called <samp>elephant_toothpaste.png</samp> was added to the chemistry pack of ''Minecraft Education'' in an unknown version.{{info needed|What version?}} It appears to be a particle atlas similar to that of campfire smoke, recolored to appear lighter.

{{w|Elephant's toothpaste}} is a popular demonstration in introductory chemistry, but was later scrapped.

The texture is still used in ''Bedrock Edition'', being functional using the 3 [[compounds]] being Soap, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Potassium Iodide using the [[lab table]] which creates the elephant toothpaste fountain tinted yellow.

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Elephant toothpaste.png|10px]]}}

{{-}}

==== Soul lava ====
In an unknown build of [[Bedrock Edition 1.16.0]],{{info needed|What build?}} a "soul lava" particle was added to <samp>particles.png</samp>. It can be seen that this particle is to the "lava" particle texture what the soul flame particle is to the ordinary "flame" particle. It appears completely unused.

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:Soul Lava (texture) BE1.png|80px]]}}
</div>

Unlike normal [[campfire]]s, soul campfires do not emit any type of ember. This is due to there being no defined particle for a soul ember,<ref name="JEsoul">{{bug|MC-185482}}</ref> something which this texture would fill in. However, despite this, the texture is yet to make any appearance in ''Java Edition''<ref name="JEsoul" /> and remains unused in ''Bedrock Edition''.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-121516}}</ref>

{{-}}

==== Copper lava ====
In [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.21.110.23]], a "copper lava" particle was added to <samp>particles.png</samp>. It can be seen that this particle is to the "lava" particle texture what the copper flame particle is to the ordinary "flame" particle. It appears completely unused.

=== Villager speech bubble ===
[[File:Unused villager speech bubble.png|thumb|100px|A villager speech bubble]]

The villager speech bubble is an image that was added along with the villager.png file in the jar when the trading system was added. It showed a trade, where [[raw chicken]] could be sold to [[villager]]s for another raw chicken. Both raw chickens have the old raw chicken texture. During an interview about villagers, [[Jeb]] offered a possible explanation: "We did some experiments with thought bubbles, but it didn't look good. So in the end, after I'd been lead on Minecraft for a year, we just decided to add an interface instead." <ref>{{citation|url=https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-villagers|title=Meet the Villagers|author=[[Marsh Davies]]|website=Minecraft.net|date=March 13, 2017}}</ref>

The texture was partially overwritten by the selection arrows. It was removed in snapshot [[Java Edition 23w31a|23w31a]].<ref>{{bug|MC-264467}}</ref>

=== waterterrain.png ===
{{info needed section|
* File is dated 2010-06-14 14:40 in inf-20100615
* What was Notch saying in his blog around this time in relation to flowing liquids?}}
In [[Java Edition Infdev 20100615|the 15 June 2010 Infdev release]], a texture file named <samp>waterterrain.png</samp> was added to the jar file. Resembling <samp>terrain.png</samp> in name, dimensions and the use of similar lilac textures in empty spots, it featured a multitude of different directional symbols.

This was added in the same version that implemented new flowing mechanics for water and lava.

<div style="text-align:center">
[[File:waterterrain.png|256px]]
</div>

Ultimately, flowing liquids simply used a 32×32 texture each (which remained within <samp>terrain.png</samp>), rotated accordingly depending on the flow direction (which could be orthogonal, diagonal or knightwise, the last of which this sheet did not account for), and this file fell into disuse. It was eventually removed in Alpha v1.2.2 with the addition of texture pack support.

{{-}}

=== watercolor.png ===
[[Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3]] introduced this file to the <samp>/misc/</samp> directory in the jar file. This image was a color map intended to be used depending on the [[biome]], similarly to the existing <samp>grasscolor.png</samp> and <samp>foliagecolor.png</samp>, where a color would be selected from a point on the image depending on temperature and humidity.

Intended for use on water, with the game even containing unused code around the time of its introduction which would apply it to water,<ref>https://twitter.com/craftycodie/status/1464312766886465545?s=20</ref> it ultimately remained unused, with water maintaining a constant color regardless of biome at the time. This may or may not be due to water's texture being blue at the time, rather than the gray or white required for an effective tint, and as such multiplying it with a color would yield undesirable results (tinting already-blue water with another shade of blue would just make it much darker and unsightly); since water's texture was [[Procedural animated texture generation|generated at runtime rather than defined as an image]], actually making water's raw texture be gray would be a non-trivial task.

<div style="text-align:center">
{{darkbg|[[File:watercolor.png|256px]]}}
</div>

Biome-tinted water was first introduced in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease]], but only to a limited extent, as swamps were the only biome to have a tint defined, and as water's texture was still blue by default, swamp water had to be tinted green to make it appear browner.

When procedurally-generated animated textures were replaced by texture files in 13w02a, the water texture was still inherently blue, even though making it gray or white would have been an easy task at this point and would allow <samp>watercolor.png</samp> to be used for biome-dependent water colors.

<samp>watercolor.png</samp> was ultimately removed in 13w24a alongside many others due to it remaining unused.

When [[Java Edition 18w15a]] expanded on biome-dependent water tints (and made the water textures white to accommodate this), the subject biomes still remained limited, as swamps and different temperature oceans were the only{{verify|test cold biomes since they're different in 1.17}} biomes to have colors which differed from the default color specified. These colors were values explicitly specified per biome, rather than taken from a colormap like <samp>watercolor.png</samp>. As a result of this approach, there are currently several oversights in the current game where special water colors have not been defined for certain biomes even when they should be.<ref>{{bug|MC-239129}}</ref>

Reimplementing and actually using this file for the majority of biomes, like is done for grass and foliage, with swamps and possibly a few other biomes being the only remaining special-cased biomes, would likely resolve this issue in its entirety, as there would no longer be a need to specify water colors in biome json files; a blank entry would cause the game to seek out a value from the color map, which is what happens currently for grass and foliage.

=== Selected and unselected ===
Squares labeled "SEL" and "UN SEL" (likely "SELECTED" and "UNSELECTED") can be found in "textures\gui\container\creative_inventory\tabs.png". Purpose is unknown, though they could possibly be used as a template for the selected tabs and unselected tabs with the rest of tabs.png.

It was removed in snapshot [[Java Edition 23w31a|23w31a]].
