The '''Redstone Update''' is the name for {{el|je}} [[Java Edition 1.5|1.5]], a major update released on March 13, 2013. Among the main changes were a number of new [[redstone components|redstone]]-related blocks, including the [[Redstone Comparator|comparator]], [[hopper]], [[dropper]], [[Daylight Sensor|daylight sensor]], [[Trapped Chest|trapped chest]], [[Weighted Pressure Plate|weighted pressure plates]] and [[Block of Redstone|block of redstone]]. A new decorative block – [[Block of Quartz|block of quartz]], crafted from [[Nether Quartz|Nether quartz]] – was also added. Also included was a [[scoreboard]] system, a new [[texture pack]] format and a [[light]]ing engine optimization.

The Redstone Update was announced at the ''Future Updates with the Minecraft PC Team'' and ''The Future of [[Plugin API|Mod API]]'' talks at [[MINECON 2012]].<ref name="gspot-mod">https://web.archive.org/web/20130305180746/http://www.gamespot.com/minecraft/videos/6400551</ref>

Development began shortly after 1.4.6 was released. Sixteen development snapshots were released, from {{verlink|Java Edition 13w01a|13w01a}} to {{verlink|Java Edition 13w10b|13w10b}}, with a few snapshots being quickly re-released straight after to fix bugs without changing the client version number. During the development period, 1.4.7 was released. Nearer the end of the snapshot cycle for the 1.5 update, Mojang focused primarily on fixing bugs, rather than adding new features.

Mojang originally planned to release a pre-release version of The Redstone Update on February 28, 2013, and the official update in the first week of March.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130228145425/http://www.mojang.com/2013/02/minecraft-snapshot-13w09a/</ref> However, the pre-release was delayed as Mojang was trying to fix more bugs before a stable release,<ref>{{tweet|jeb|307505870839902208|Minecraft snapshot 13w09c, pre-release next week instead:|March 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130304005418/http://www.mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-snapshot-13w09c/</ref> and was subsequently released on March 7.
