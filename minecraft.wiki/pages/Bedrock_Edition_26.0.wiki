*** {{cd|minecraft:capped}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:the_end}}

'''Blocks'''
* Added {{cd|use_liquid_clipping}} field to the {{cd|detection_rules}} in {{cd|minecraft:liquid_detection}}
** "{{cd|true}}" means the block will use the "{{cd|collision_box}}" to visually clip the water.
** "{{cd|false}}" ignores liquid clipping, which will render water across the whole block.
** Defaults to {{cd|true}} prior to {{cd|format_version}} 1.26.0.
** Defaults to {{cd|false}} for {{cd|format_version}} 1.26.0 and after.
* Updated {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} renamed field {{cd|propogates_power}} to {{cd|propagates_power}}.
* The option {{cd|alpha_masked_tint}} in {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} no longer requires "Upcoming Creator Features".
* Released {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} from experimental for {{cd|format_version}} >= 1.26.0.
* Added block permutation component validation for geometry and material instance components. If one is added, the other one will need to added.

* Updated the {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component:
** Changed {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} so DOWN face is rotated 180 degrees, this brings it in parity with non data driven full blocks and Java full blocks.
** The old geometry can still used by explicitly using the identifier {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block_v1}}.
** Any existing blocks using {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} that have a {{cd|format_version}} less than 1.26.0 will look the same and internally be considered as {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block_v1}}.
* Released {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} improvements from experimental and removed requirement of format version 1.21.130 or higher for those improvements.
** Can now have an array of collision boxes.

'''[[Camera]]'''
* Provided the script API for supporting entity type families in the aim assist.

'''Components'''
* Updated {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_X}} behavior components:
** Made schemas stricter when parsing and will fail to load an entity json that has invalid data in versions 1.26.0 and newer:
*** {{cd|min_look_time}} and {{cd|max_look_time}} - deprecated and has been replaced properly with {{cd|look_time}}.
**** Uses of {{cd|min_look_time}} and {{cd|max_look_time}} will get upgraded automatically.
**** {{cd|look_time}} - takes {{cd|min}} and {{cd|max}} as a range.
** These changes affect the following behavior components:
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_entity}}
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_player}}
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_target}}
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_trading_player}}
** Previous usage of the following definitions will not be automatically upgraded to preserve old behavior:
*** {{cd|look_time}} - this was not correctly parsed prior to version 1.26.0, and always resulted in default values being assigned to {{cd|min_look_time}} and {{cd|max_look_time}}.
*** {{cd|target_distance}} - was used in some definitions and it was never passed to the component.
**** This would just silently fail and assign default values to the component.

'''[[Block components|Block Components]]'''
* Released the component {{cd|minecraft:connection_rule}} from experimental for block format versions 26.0 or higher.
* Released the component {{cd|minecraft:support}} from experimental for block format versions 26.0 or higher.

* Changed the {{cd|swing}} field to default to {{cd|true}} in the {{cd|minecraft:interact}} component.
* Split the {{cd|minecraft:breedable}} component into two:

*** {{cd|blend_attributes}}
*** {{cd|inherit_tamed}}
*** {{cd|mutation_factor}}
*** {{cd|mutation_strategy}}
*** {{cd|random_variant_mutation_interval}}
*** {{cd|random_extra_variant_mutation_interval}}
*** {{cd|deny_parents_variant}}
*** {{cd|breeds_with}}
*** {{cd|combine_parent_colors}}
*** {{cd|property_inheritance}}
*** {{cd|parent_centric_attribute_blending}}
** {{cd|minecraft:breedable}} now only contains data about how an entity uses breeding behavior.
*** The way it spawns the child entity is via the {{cd|minecraft:offspring_data}} component.

** Default value: {{cd|0.0}}

'''[[Item components|Item Components]]'''
