'''17w47a''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on November 22, 2017<ref>{{snap|17w47a|November 22, 2017}}</ref>, which added a new type of [[pumpkin]], [[debug stick]]s, an item form of many blocks which previously could only be placed using commands, tweaked the placement conditions for many blocks, performed [[The Flattening]], and much more.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Oak Button (S) JE3.png; Spruce Button JE1 BE1.png; Birch Button JE1 BE1.png; Jungle Button JE1 BE1.png; Acacia Button JE1 BE1.png; Dark Oak Button JE1 BE1.png|32px}} {{Animate|Oak Pressure Plate JE3 BE1.png; Spruce Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png; Birch Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png; Jungle Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png; Acacia Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png; Dark Oak Pressure Plate JE1 BE1.png|32px}} {{Animate|Oak Trapdoor JE3.png; Spruce Trapdoor JE1 BE1.png; Birch Trapdoor JE1 BE1.png; Jungle Trapdoor JE1 BE1.png; Acacia Trapdoor JE1 BE1.png; Dark Oak Trapdoor JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Button]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, and [[trapdoor]]s'''
* Can now be made from all six types of wood.

'''[[File:Pumpkin JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Pumpkin]]s'''
* New block, without the face.
* Previous pumpkin block has been renamed to "Carved Pumpkin".
** Right-clicking a pumpkin block with [[shears]] turns it into a carved pumpkin and makes it drop 4 [[pumpkin seeds]].

=== Items ===
'''{{Animate|Oak Wood (UD) JE3.png; Spruce Wood (UD) JE3.png; Birch Wood (UD) JE3.png; Jungle Wood (UD) JE3.png; Acacia Wood (UD) JE4.png; Dark Oak Wood (UD) JE4.png|32px}} {{Animate|Red Mushroom Block (ESU) JE1 BE1.png; Brown Mushroom Block (ESU) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[File:Mushroom Stem (ESU) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[File:Oak Slab JE3 BE2.png|32px]] [[File:Smooth Quartz Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[File:Smooth Red Sandstone JE1.png|32px]] [[File:Smooth Sandstone JE3.png|32px]] [[File:Smooth Stone JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bark]], [[mushroom block]], [[mushroom stem]], [[petrified oak slab]], [[smooth quartz]], [[smooth red sandstone]], [[smooth sandstone]], and [[smooth stone]]'''
* Now have item forms in the creative inventory.

'''[[File:Debug Stick.gif|32px]] [[Debug stick]] '''
* Cycles between different block states.
** Left-clicking cycles through states; right-clicking cycles through values. 
** Shift-clicking cycles through the states or values in reverse order.
** Only obtainable through commands

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* New option when editing a world to make a backup and open the backups folder.
* An option in chat settings to toggle automatic command suggestions (defaults on, otherwise hit tab to bring them up).

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values#Block IDs|Numeric block IDs]] no longer exist; there is no longer a limit to distinct possible block IDs.
* Blocks with a collision box now have matching bounding boxes.
** Affected: [[anvil]]s, [[brewing stand]]s, [[cauldron]]s, [[fence]]s, filled [[end portal frame]]s, [[glass pane]]s, [[hopper]]s, [[iron bars]], [[lily pad]]s, [[piston]]s, [[stairs]], and [[vines]]
** Updated the collision box of anvils and hoppers.
** Does not affect blocks with a collision box smaller than their [[model]], such as [[soul sand]] and [[snow]] layers.
* Blocks now emit the block breaking particles according to their size.
* The outline for block hitboxes can now have other shapes than just one cuboid. This causes the outline of stairs and other blocks to match with the hitbox.

'''[[Banner]]s'''
* Now make a sound when placed.

'''[[Bed]]s'''
* Now require a block below it as a support. 
** Previously, this was only required when placing the bed and the block could be destroyed afterward without the bed being destroyed.

'''[[Button]]s'''
* Can no longer be placed on top of [[piston]]s.

'''[[Cacti]]'''
* Now break if [[sign]]s or [[banner]]s are placed directly next to it.
** Previously, these blocks couldn't be placed like this.

'''[[Chest]]s and [[trapped chest]]s'''
* Can now be put directly next to their double variants instead of requiring one block between them.
** Shift right-clicking a chest or trapped chest next to a chest or trapped chest respectively doesn't make the two chests or 2 trapped chests combine into a double chest or double trapped chest.

'''[[Cocoa bean]]s'''
* Can now be placed when aiming at blocks that it cannot be placed on if there is an adjacent block that they can be placed on.
* Can now replace replaceable blocks such as snow, fire or grass when placed by the player.

'''[[Dispenser]]s'''
* Crafting it no longer requires a fully repaired [[bow]].<ref name="damage">{{bug|MC-122844}} (resolved as "Works as Intended")</ref>

'''[[Door]]s'''
* Can now be placed by aiming at the side of a block.

'''[[Enchanting Table]]'''
* "Enchantment Table" has been renamed to "Enchanting Table".

'''[[Fence gate]]s and [[pumpkin]]s'''
* Placing them no longer requires a block below.

'''[[Head]]s'''
* Now make a sound when placed.
* Can no longer be placed inside entities.
* Player heads have been renamed from "Head" to "Player Head".

'''[[Infested block]]s'''
* Now break instantly, regardless of a tool that the player is using.
** When broken with [[Silk Touch]], the non-infested counterpart of the block drops.

'''[[Lever]]s'''
* Flicking it on now displays redstone [[particles]].
* Can no longer be placed on top of [[piston]]s.

'''[[Note block]]s'''
* Are no longer [[block entities]].
** Hence now pushable by pistons.

'''[[Redstone comparator]]'''
* Now has a bottom texture plane.

'''[[Redstone repeater]]'''
* Now has a bottom texture plane.

'''[[Redstone wire]]'''
* Now makes a sound when placed.

'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Now make a sound when placed.

'''[[TNT]]'''
* Removed the <code>explode</code> block state (explode on punch).<ref name="explode">{{bug|MC-122563}} (resolved as "Works as Intended")</ref>

'''[[Vines]]'''
* Multiple vines facing different directions, including on the bottom of blocks, can now be placed in the same block space.

=== Items ===
'''[[Carrot on a stick]]'''
* Now craftable with a damaged fishing rod.<ref name="craft">{{bug|MC-123196}} (resolved as "Works as Intended")</ref>

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* Using them on blocks without collision box now spawns the mob inside that block rather than next to it.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Witch hut]]s'''
* Now generate with a [[mushroom]] in the [[flower pot]].
** Previously, they were completely empty.

=== Non-mob entities ===
''' [[Armor stand]]s'''
* Can now be placed inside water, lava and fire just like any other replaceable block.
* Can no longer step up blocks.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|blockdata}}'''
* Removed in favor of {{cmd|data}}.

'''{{cmd|particle}}'''
* Particle names now use [[resource location]]s.
* Old ID → new ID:
** <code>mobspellambient</code> → <code>minecraft:ambient_entity_effect</code>
** <code>angryvillager</code> → <code>minecraft:angry_villager</code>
** <code>blockdust</code> and <code>blockcrack</code> → <code>minecraft:block</code>

'''{{cmd|playsound}}'''
* {{key|Tab}} auto-completes custom sound events.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Because of [[Java Edition 1.13/Flattening|The Flattening]], certain blocks and items have been moved around in their respective groups, for example, the [[purpur block]] is now after [[obsidian]].
* [[Mushroom block]]s, [[farmland]] and [[grass path]] are added to the inventory, under the ''Decoration Blocks'' group; blank [[firework rocket]]s are added to the ''Miscellaneous'' group; and bark, smooth stone, sandstone, red sandstone and quartz are added to the ''Building Blocks'' group.

=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition 1.13/Flattening|The "flattening"]]'''
* Numeric block metadata completely phased out in favor of block states.
* Split, merged, created, deleted, and renamed a lot of [[block]]s, block states, block entities and [[item]]s.
** Blocks and items previously differing because of damage value have gotten their own id, for example <code>white_wool</code> instead of <code>wool:0</code>
** Damage has been moved to the tag <code>tag</code> and is only used by tools, armor and maps.
** Files and commands no longer use <code>data</code> or <code>set_data</code>.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Are being updated.
** <code>stat.(stat)</code> is now <code>minecraft.custom:minecraft.(stat)</code>.
** <code>stat.(stat).minecraft.(block/item/entity ID)</code> is now <code>minecraft.(stat):minecraft.(block/item/entity ID)</code>.

'''[[Superflat]] customization'''
* Preset strings no longer use a version number.
