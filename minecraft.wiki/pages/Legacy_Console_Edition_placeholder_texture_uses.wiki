This page documents all known cases where [[placeholder texture]]s are or were used in vanilla ''[[Legacy Console Edition]]''.

For this page, due to the nature and intended use of placeholder textures, "vanilla" is defined in a much more strict sense than normal: alongside having no mods installed, use of non-default [[texture pack]]s is also forbidden, as these can allow for arbitrary blocks, items and so on to point to copies of the placeholder texture.
