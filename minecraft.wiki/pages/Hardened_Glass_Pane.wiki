A '''hardened glass pane''' is a type of block obtained by crafting with [[glass pane]]s and several compounds. It also comes in 16 colors as [[Hardened Stained Glass Pane|stained variants]], although a player must first dye regular glass panes into [[stained glass pane]]s beforehand.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Unlike a normal glass pane, a hardened glass pane drops as an [[item]] to be picked up again when broken with any tool or by hand. It also takes significantly longer to break.
