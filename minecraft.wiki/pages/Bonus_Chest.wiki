The '''bonus chest''' is a structure-like [[feature]] that appears near the [[player]]'s spawn if the "Bonus Chest" option is toggled on the "[[Create New World]]" screen. It generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including [[tool]]s, [[block]]s, and [[food]].

== Generation ==
If the "Bonus Chest" option is set to "ON" in the "More World Options..." {{in|java}} or "Game Settings" {{in|bedrock}} part of the "[[Create New World]]" screen, a single bonus chest is generated in the world, no matter how many players there are. It appears somewhere near the player's initial spawn point, within the chunk at the world spawn point, with up to four [[torch]]es generated around it on adjacent blocks. It always generates on the highest block, and cannot generate naturally nor with the {{code|/place}} command if it reaches the build limit.

The Bonus Chest option is not available in [[hardcore]] mode, thus making the bonus chest unavailable as well.

{{IN|java}}, on [[server]]s, the bonus chest can be enabled by running the server with the {{code|--bonusChest}} argument.

== Construction ==
Bonus chests contain a single chest surrounded by four [[torch]]es. The torches may be overridden if the torch locations are obstructed by other blocks such as uneven ground, trees, or leaves, or they may instead float.
