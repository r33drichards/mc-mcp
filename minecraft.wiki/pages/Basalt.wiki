'''Basalt''' is a [[block]] found in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Basalt drops as an item if mined by any [[pickaxe]]. If mined by any other tool, it drops nothing.

{{Breaking row|Basalt|Pickaxe|Wooden|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Basalt generates naturally as [[basalt pillar]]s, which are found in the [[soul sand valley]] biome. They also generate in the [[basalt deltas]] biome as regular terrain and as part of [[basalt columns]]. {{IN|java}}, they also generate in [[blobs]], which attempt to replace [[netherrack]] 75 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3–7 from [[altitude|levels]] 0 to 127 in [[basalt deltas]] biomes.

Basalt can also be found naturally as part of [[bastion remnant]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
[[File:Basalt generator.gif|thumb|A simple basalt generator]]
Basalt also generates when [[lava]] flows into a space that is on top of [[soul soil]] and adjacent to [[blue ice]]. The flowing [[lava]] is then replaced with basalt.

== Usage ==
Basalt's only current use is as building material. Like [[log]]s and [[quartz pillar]]s, basalt blocks point perpendicular to whatever block face they are placed on.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Geologically, {{w|basalt}} is a volcanic rock that cools from mafic lava flows. Mafic lava is runny, much like [[lava]] in [[the Nether]], and under the right conditions it can cool into the stacks of [[basalt columns]], much like those seen in [[basalt deltas]].
** Basalt makes up most of Earth's sea floor, as well as {{w|Iceland}} and the {{w|Hawaiian Islands}}.
* Despite being an extrusive igneous rock, basalt has a lower mining time than [[granite]] and [[diorite]], which are intrusive.
* Basalt is the only rock-like block to have both a polished and smooth variant.
