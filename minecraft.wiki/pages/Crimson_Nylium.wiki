'''Crimson nylium''' is a variant of [[netherrack]] that generates in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Crimson nylium drops itself only when mined with a [[pickaxe]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]; if mined with a normal pickaxe, it drops [[netherrack]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Crimson Nylium|drop=0|Pickaxe|Wooden}}

=== Natural generation ===
Crimson nylium generates in the [[crimson forest]] biome.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
Crimson nylium is dropped when an [[enderman]] dies while holding it.

=== Chest loot ===
{{LootChestItem|crimson-nylium}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{ctrl|Using}} [[bone meal]] on [[netherrack]] that is placed next to or adjacent to crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into nylium of that type. [[Air]] must be above the netherrack during this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a [[dispenser]] with bone meal directly into that netherrack block.  If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread.

=== Renewability ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
As [[netherrack]] generates in [[Nether portal]]s spawn floating, using bone meal on netherrack turns them into nylium, making them renewable.

== Usage ==
Similar to [[grass block]]s and [[mycelium]], crimson nylium decays (based on [[random tick]]s) into netherrack when an [[opaque]] block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath [[water]] or [[lava]].<ref>{{bug|MC-173356|||WAI}}</ref> It decays when covered with [[snow]].<ref>{{bug|MC-174639|||WAI}}</ref>

Like mycelium and [[podzol]], [[mushroom]]s can remain on nylium blocks in any [[light]] level. [[Huge mushroom]]s can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on nylium.

[[Crimson Fungi]] can likewise be grown into [[huge crimson fungi]] using [[bone meal]], although the fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal is never consumed.

Similar to [[grass block]]s, the player can apply [[bone meal]] to crimson nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generates vegetation that occurs in its native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly [[crimson forest]] vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly [[warped forest]] vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occassionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5×5 area, centered on the nylium block on which bone meal is used. 

=== Note Blocks ===
Crimson nylium can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

* The name is a portmanteau of "[[The Nether|Nether]]" and "[[Mycelium]]", the name of the part of a fungus analogous to roots.
