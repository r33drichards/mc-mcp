'''Cheese''' is a joke [[food]] and a [[block]] that can be eaten by the player. It generates on [[The Moon]] as the main ground block, referencing a common joke about the moon being made of cheese.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cheese drops itself if it has not been bitten. Once the cheese is bitten, it cannot be recollected even with the use of [[Silk Touch]].

=== Mob loot ===
Upon death, [[moon cow]]s drop 0-2 cheese. The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of [[Looting]], for a maximum of 5 cheese blocks with Looting III.

=== Milk bucket ===
If the <code>minecraft:instacheese</code> [[vote]] is active, using a [[milk bucket]] on the ground places cheese, similarly to [[powder snow]]. It cannot be picked up into the bucket again.

== Usage ==
Similar to [[cake]]s, cheese can be eaten when placed in the world. However, unlike cakes, the cheese block is divided into 8 smaller cubes. Clicking on one of them eats only the selected part, unlike cakes, where slices cannot be chosen.

Eating cheese restores both hunger and oxygen, allowing the player to survive on the Moon.
