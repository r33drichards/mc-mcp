'''1.16.210''' is a minor update to {{el|be}} released on March 9, 2021, which adds new ambient sounds to [[the Nether]], and fixes bugs.<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360057677072-Minecraft-1-16-210-Bedrock-|title=Minecraft - 1.16.210 (Bedrock)|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=March 9, 2021}}</ref> While it was not the last update to 1.16, it was the last one before the beta builds of [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.0|1.17.0]] started.

Development phases contained some of the [[Caves & Cliffs]] features through [[experimental gameplay]], which were not included in the full release for this update but are part of [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.0|1.17.0]].<ref>{{tweet|MattGartzke|1334183958586683396|My understanding is that Experimental Features only exist in Beta releases.}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|MattGartzke|1364622682201882626|You'll see more 1.16 versions before seeing 1.17. Increasing the second octet is still a little ways off, even though we're still testing Caves and Cliffs features. At the end of the day, it's just a version number.|25 Feb 2021}}</ref>
