The '''modified badlands plateau''' or '''mesa plateau mutated''' was a rare variant of the badlands that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

==Description==
The modified badlands plateau featured smaller plateaus and somewhat harsher terrain than the badlands plateau, mimicking large plateaus that have weathered more over time. Because of the more variable elevation of the plateaus, more colors of [[Stained Terracotta|stained terracotta]] were exposed. [[Eroded badlands]] replaced the usual thin desert border that this biome variant shared with other biomes. The modified badlands plateau was the second rarest biome in ''Minecraft'', after the [[Modified Jungle Edge|modified jungle edge]], and was only present in about 1/5 of the badlands biomes, and almost always (98% chance) came with an eroded badlands bordering the edges and modified wooded badlands plateaus surrounding it at the center.

== Mobs ==
Modified badlands plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as badlands.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
