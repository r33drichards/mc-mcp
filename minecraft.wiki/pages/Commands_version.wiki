Presents the server's game version information to the client on the [[chat]].

== Usage ==
{{see also|version.json}}

Prints the server's game version information on the chat, such as the name, protocol version, and the [[Pack format|resource pack and data pack formats]].

This is similar to the {{key|F3+V}} [[debug hotkey]], but presents server side info instead of client side.

The following is an example of what would be printed to chat on [[1.21.8]]:
<pre style="font-family:Minecraft">
Server version info:
id = 1.21.8
name = 1.21.8
data = 4440
series = main
protocol = 772 (0x304)
build_time = Tue Jul 17 08:00:57 EDT 2025
pack_resource = 64
pack_data = 81
stable = yes
</pre>
