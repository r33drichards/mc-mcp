== Usage ==
{{See also|Tutorial:Hunger management}}
To eat an enchanted golden poisonous potato, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. It restores {{hunger|2}} points of hunger and 9.6 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

Unlike most foods, enchanted golden poisonous potatoes can be eaten even if the hunger bar is full.

The enchanted golden poisonous potato provides:
*[[Absorption]] IV for 2 minutes (providing {{hp|16|absorption=1}} points of absorption health)
*[[Poison]] VIII for 20 seconds (dealing {{hp|20}} damage)
*[[Luck]] and [[Bad Luck]] for 5 minutes

Damage from Poison can be reduced by armor with [[Protection]] or [[Resistance]] effect, resulting in net gain of health points.

== Trivia ==

* The crafting recipe is a reference to the old crafting recipe of the [[enchanted golden apple]].
