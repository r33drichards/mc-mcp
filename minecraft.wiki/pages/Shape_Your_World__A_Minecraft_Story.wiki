'''Shape Your World: A Minecraft Story''' is a live action short film themed after the [[Chase the Skies]] [[game drop]]. Released on the {{w|International Day of Friendship}}, the video tells the story of two teenagers named Sally and Sully who are separated, but are able to reconnect through video games.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-boo-agency_shape-your-world-a-minecraft-story-celebrating-activity-7356375398986719232-ZyJx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADdy8wsBcTksodH13v_sRKlptiHH1ZyFhRI|title=Celebrating International Day of Friendship by introducing the world to the short story of Sully & Sally.<br><br>Because when you miss your friend, just* add water.<br><br>Minecraft is more than a vast creative sandbox, it’s a whole world of stories waiting to be discovered.

== Summary ==
A boy named Sully says goodbye to his girlfriend, Sally, whose parents are moving away to {{Wikipedia|Australia}}, both incredibly saddened by the situation. As Sully retreats into his room and sulks, he decides to play ''[[Minecraft]]'', apparently on [[Christmas]]. As he sees a present chest, he's reminded of a gift Sally had given him, realizing it's a [[dried ghast]]. He takes it into the bathroom and hydrates it with the sink, discovering it's a real, living [[ghastling]]. As it flies up into the air, it makes a mess of the room and flies out the window.

An unknown amount of time later, the creature has matured into a [[happy ghast]], Sully somehow having crafted a [[harness]]. As he prepares for a journey, he sneaks in wearing a bathrobe and hesitates before jumping out the bathroom window. Together, the ghast takes the boy on a ride through the clouds, all the way down under. Flying above the desert, the boy calls out to Sally, who is relieved to see that her idea worked. The two join each other on the ghast, and fly off into the sky.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Today is the International Day of Friendship! it's a perfect time to remember those shared Minecraft moments: adventuring into the depths together, planning a perfect base, or successfully raiding a friend's chest moments after they log off. Minecraft can help you stay connected, no matter how far apart you might be.

It's a little known fact that our unique flying mob - the Happy Ghast - also has the ability to bring people together in even more imaginative, cinematic ways.

DISCLAIMER: Mounting a huge flying mob and using it to traverse the earth IRL is both silly and dangerous.

== Trivia ==

* At one point, text appears on screen saying "don't jump from windows onto mounts in real life. It's a Minecraft thing." This is a callback to a similar gag in [[Minecraft: Shape Your World]], where a disclaimer was given for using a [[water bucket]] to survive a fall.
* Travelling from Stockholm to Australia in a straight line (a distance of approximately 12,500 km or 7,700 miles at least) using a [[happy ghast]] with the in-game [[Transportation#Methods|speed of 3.5 m/s]] would take more than 40 (real-life) days.
* The short was primarily made using practical effects, with minimal CGI and no generative AI.<ref name=":designrush" />
