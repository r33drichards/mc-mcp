While there is a version mislabeled as "rd-20090515" in the launcher, loading it will just run [[rd-161348]], which is after rd-20090515 and the last version of pre-classic.

=== General ===

'''[[Light]]'''
* Shadows have been brightened.

== Technical ==
==== Level generation ====
* Unless a {{cd|level.dat}} from an older version is launched, the world is no longer flat.
* Loading a world from older pre-Classic versions causes all blocks to become stone.

== Trivia ==
* This version is the version shown in the "Minecraft progress." video.{{cn}}
* The "rd" before the version number stands for [[RubyDung]], a game Notch was working on before ''Minecraft'', whose codebase was later reused for ''Minecraft''.
* A duplicate of rd-161348 in the launcher is labeled "rd-20090515", however, rd-20090515 is not on the Minecraft download servers, and attempting to download it downloads rd-161348 instead, a later version.
