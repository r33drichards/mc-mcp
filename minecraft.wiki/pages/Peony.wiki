A '''peony''' is a tall [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[pink dye]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A peony can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A peony also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Peony|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===

Peonies generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[forest]]s, [[flower forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[old growth birch forest]]s, and [[dark forest]]s biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a peony, the flower drops a copy of itself.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, peonies can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Like other tall flowers, peonies cannot be placed inside [[flower pot]]s. 

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with peonies, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding===
Peonies can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a peony have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a peony into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of peonies yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
