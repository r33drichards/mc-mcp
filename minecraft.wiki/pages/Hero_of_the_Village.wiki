'''Hero of the Village''' is a [[player]]-exclusive [[status effect]] obtained by defeating a [[raid]] and lasts 40 minutes, during which players receive discounts from [[Trading|villager trades]], and {{in|je}}, gifts from villagers.

== Effect ==
{{IN|java}} the effect's level will be that of the defeated raid; {{in|bedrock}} there is only one level.

Players receive discounts from all [[villager]]s, including ones from villages other than the one the raid was defeated in. The [[wandering trader]]'s trades are only affected {{in|bedrock}}.

Hero of the Village is a [[status effect]] and can be removed through all conventional methods, such as drinking [[milk]] or dying.

=== Animation ===
[[File:Hero of the Village Bedrock Animation.gif|The {{BE}} animation for the Hero of the Village effect activating.|alt=|thumb|280x280px]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, upon the effect being given a short animation of the effect icon appearing on the screen plays, similar to a [[totem of undying]].

=== Price decrement ===
Level I Hero of the Village decreases the cost of the first item in a [[Trading|villager trade]] by 30% of the initial price, each additional level decreases the price by an another {{frac|1|16}} (6.25%) for a total price discount of 55% at level V. The discount is rounded down but always at least 1.

Example: Level III would give a 42.5% discount. For trade with 14 [[emeralds]] as the cost, the discount would be 5 emeralds (rounded down from 5.95 emeralds), for a final price of 9 emeralds.

This effect stacks with [[Trading#Sale_prices|other price changes]] but uses the initial price before other discounts for determining its own discount.

=== Gifts ===
{{exclusive|java}}
Upon obtaining the effect, villagers randomly throw items from a certain pool at the player as rewards, listed below. In order for a player to have gifts thrown to them, they must have Hero of the Village, the villager must be able to see them, and they must be within 5 blocks of the villager. After throwing a gift, a villager enters a cooldown lasting between 30 seconds and 5min 30 sec. Villagers give gifts only while idle, working, or meeting at the town center (bell). They do not give gifts during the night when they should be sleeping.
