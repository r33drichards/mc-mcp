'''Quick Play''' is a feature available in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'', allowing players to directly join a [[singleplayer]] world or a [[multiplayer]] server, by skipping the screens and menus in-between.<ref>{{mcnet|quick-play-coming-java-and-bedrock-edition|Quick Play is coming to Java and Bedrock Edition|February 12, 2024}}</ref>

== Usage ==
[[File:Launcher Quick Play.png|thumb|The launcher with the Quick Play bar in the top right.]]

Quick Play instances are created automatically once you play in a world or a server. They appear as icons stacked next to the green "Play" button on the ''Java Edition'' or ''Bedrock Edition'' tabs of the launcher. By hovering over the icons with the mouse, all buttons are shown separately and show the name, installation, last played date, multiplayer type, and game mode. 
Instances are sorted from the most recently played (bottom) to the least recently played (top).

There are a total of five slots. Once they are all filled, playing another world causes the oldest instance to be removed from the list, and the newest instance to be added. This behavior can be avoided by pinning instances; however, pinned instances still count for the five slots.

Quick Play works for both [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']] and [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock Edition'']], and creates instances for [[worlds]], ''Editor'' [[projects]], [[servers]] and [[Realms]]. Realms can also be opened through Quick Play from the "Realms" tab.

If one plays a world with the same name, the icon is reused.

=== Disabling Quick Play ===
[[File:Launcher settings Quick Play.png|thumb|Settings related to Quick Play in the launcher.]]

Quick Play can be toggled in the [[Minecraft Launcher#Settings|launcher settings]]. Disabling it does not remove instances, therefore enabling it again displays previously saved instances.

To actually remove quick play instances, you can click on the "Delete All Quick Play Entries" button. After a confirmation dialog, it deletes all instances, pinned and unpinned, of the user currently logged in.

== Options ==
[[File:Edit Quick Play Game Java.png|thumb|The edit window for Java Edition quick play.]]
[[File:Edit Quick Play Game Bedrock.png|thumb|The edit window for Bedrock Edition quick play.]]

Quick Play instances can be customized by clicking on the button at the right of quick play icons.

An instance icon can be changed. For [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']], these are the same 3D-rendered icons as the ones for [[Minecraft Launcher#Installations|installations]]. For [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock Edition'']], these are 2D square icons. It is also possible to select a custom icon, which must be 128x128 pixels in size.

An instance can be pinned, which moves it to the very left. On the edit screen, pinned and non-pinned instances are separated by a vertical bar. To change order of pinned instances, you have to unpin and pin again an instance.

The third option, "Show Title Initial", displays the first letter of the instance name on the icon, in uppercase. For example, on the first image on the right, checking this option would display an uppercase white "M" in front of the logo.
