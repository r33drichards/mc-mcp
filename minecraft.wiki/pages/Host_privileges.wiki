{{exclusive|legacy console}}

'''Host privileges''' are an option exclusive to the [[Legacy Console Edition]], allowing the [[player]] to enable or disable the [[daylight cycle]], [[weather]] cycle, keep [[inventory]], [[mob spawning]], and mob griefing. Enabling this option deactivates [[achievements]] or trophies permanently for this world.

== World-creating options ==

=== Daylight Cycle ===
Turns on or off the [[daylight cycle]]. Defaults to enabled.

=== Weather Cycle ===
If disabled, the [[weather]] does not change. If enabled, the weather changes to clear, [[rain]], [[Thunderstorm|thunder]], or [[Snowfall|snowy]] (in [[Biome#Cold biomes|cold biomes]]). Defaults to enabled.

=== Keep Inventory ===
When enabled, your inventory stays when you die.

=== Mob Spawning ===
If enabled, mobs spawn naturally. If disabled, mobs don't spawn naturally (except for [[vindicator]]s and [[evoker]]s in [[woodland mansion]]s, [[villager]]s in [[village]]s and [[elder guardian]]s in [[ocean monument]]s). Mobs can still spawn through [[monster spawner]]s and [[spawn egg]]s. Defaults to enabled.

=== Mob Griefing ===
If disabled, mobs don't change [[blocks]]. [[Creeper]] [[explosion]]s don't destroy [[blocks]], [[sheep]] don't turn [[grass block]]s into [[dirt]] by eating it, snow golems don't cover the ground with snow, [[evokers]] aren't able to change colors of sheep, and [[endermen]] don't pick up blocks. Defaults to enabled.

== In-game options ==
In game, the host and players set to "moderators" can change all options listed above and below.

=== Game modes ===
The player can change the default and their own [[gamemode]].

=== Difficulty ===
The player can change the [[difficulty]].

=== Weather ===
The player can change the weather into:
* [[Rain]] (and [[Snowfall|snow]]; only in [[Biome#Cold biomes|cold biomes]])
* [[Thunderstorm]]
* Clear (removes [[weather]])

=== Time of day ===
The player can change the [[Daylight cycle|time of day]] into [[Daylight cycle#Day|day]] or [[Daylight cycle#Night|night]].

==== Day ====
Setting the time to 1000.

==== Night ====
Setting the time to 13000.

=== Teleportation ===
In [[multiplayer]], the player can teleport to other players. Players can also teleport other players to themselves.

=== Set World Spawn Point ===
Pressing the button for world spawn point changes the [[player]]'s default [[World Spawn#Individual spawn|spawn]] point.

== Player Options ==
The host player and players set as moderators can enable or disable these options in the player menu. All players set as moderators must be allowed by the host or other moderator players to enable or disable these options. Moderator players can change these options on other players (except the host).

=== Disable Exhaustion ===
If enabled, the hunger bar for this player never depletes unless naturally healing, and if the hunger bar is empty the player does not take starvation damage. Additionally, this allows the player to only need {{Hunger|1}} or more hunger points to naturally regenerate health, instead of needing {{Hunger|17}} or more to naturally regenerate health. Can be enabled or disabled in all game modes except Creative.

=== Invisibility ===
If enabled, allows the player to become fully [[Status effect#Invisibility|invisible]] and invincible. This includes damage from the [[void]]. Additionally, this causes the player to be unable to attack other players, player-created [[iron golem]]s, [[snow golem]]s, tamed [[wolves]], [[parrots]], [[horses]], [[donkeys]], [[mules]], [[llamas]], and [[skeleton horse]]s.

=== Flying ===
If enabled, the player can enable or disable flying on all game modes except Creative.

=== Set Player Spawn Point ===
Sets the player's spawn point. If the spawn point set by this command gets obstructed, causes the player to spawn at the [[World Spawn|world spawn point]].
