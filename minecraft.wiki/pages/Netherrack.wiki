'''Netherrack''' is a frail stone [[block]] found abundantly in [[the Nether]]. [[Fire]] lit on top of netherrack burns indefinitely and cannot be extinguished by [[rain]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break netherrack is [[pickaxe]]. Netherrack needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time increases and the block drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Netherrack|Pickaxe|Wood}}
Netherrack drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Netherrack makes up most of [[the Nether]]'s terrain, and also generates as part of [[ruined portal]]s in the [[Overworld]] and the Nether.

Netherrack generates as part of bridge and treasure room [[bastion remnant]]s.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Nylium ===
[[Nylium]] drops a netherrack block when it's destroyed using a pickaxe that's not enchanted with [[Silk Touch]].

=== Post-generation ===
Crimson or warped [[nylium]] transforms into netherrack if a solid, opaque [[block]] is directly above it, or when it is covered by [[snow]].<ref>{{bug|MC-174639||Snow on top of nylium turns the nylium to netherrack|WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|bedrock}}, netherrack generates as part of [[nether portal]]s spawned floating, making netherrack [[Renewable resource|renewable]].

== Usage ==
Netherrack can be used as a cheap building block. Because of its abundance and softness, it can be used to construct temporary structures that can be used for scaffolding, blockage, or other purposes.

When netherrack's top is lit on [[fire]], the fire burns indefinitely and isn't put out by [[rain]]. This fire can spread to [[flammable]] blocks adjacent to the netherrack. 

{{ctrl|Using}} [[bone meal]] on netherrack placed next to warped nylium or crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into more warped or crimson nylium.

If rain falls on netherrack, it produces smoke particle effects, similar to that of [[fire]].

== Trivia ==
* The "blood" on the old netherrack texture was originally intended to be red moss.<ref>{{tweet|notch|28440473768|@PBKelson It does? ;-) It's hard to draw red moss in few pixels.|Oct 22, 2010|name=[[Markus Persson]]}}</ref> Moreover, Notch was stating that Minecraft will remain blood-free shortly before the [[Halloween Update]] release, when the block was added.<ref>{{tweet|notch|28693823783|@mahouyuki_bot That's a good point..|Oct 25, 2010|name=[[Markus Persson]]}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|28771764228|I wont be using the gory texture after all. I want to keep minecraft blood free.|Oct 26, 2010|name=[[Markus Persson]]}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|28772018815|@InsanityOnABun there hasn't been blood in MC ever. It's a conscious decision that i forgot when i saw the awesome texture.|Oct 26, 2010|name=[[Markus Persson]]}}</ref> 
** Despite being a common fan name before the addition of tooltips in [[Java Edition Beta 1.0]], "bloodstone" has never been an official name for the block, with the earliest endorsed term being "netherstone".<ref name="netherstone"/>
* Analyzing netherrack in a [[material reducer]] reveals it to be a volcanic silicate rock rich in mercury.{{only|be|ee}}
