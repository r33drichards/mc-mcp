{{Disambig}}

'''Insomnia''' is a mechanic in ''Minecraft'' that allows [[phantoms]] to spawn around players that have not entered a [[bed]] or died for three in-game days (1 hour or 72000 ticks). This value is specifically defined by the "Since last rest" [[statistic]] and can be disabled with the command “/gamerule doInsomnia false.” 

'''Insomnia''' may refer to:
* {{EntityLink|Phantom}}s - phantoms may only spawn when a player has insomnia.
* [[Sleeping]] - Sleeping or entering a bed are methods to reset the insomnia counter.
* {{cmd|gamerule doInsomnia}} - A gamerule that enables or disables insomnia, and thus, phantom spawning.
