The '''windswept savanna''' or '''savanna mutated''' is a shattered and mountainuous variant of [[savanna]] that generates in areas with high [[World generation#Biomes|erosion]] close to [[swamp]]s and other [[windswept]] biomes. The terrain consists of huge cliffs and floating islands covered with [[coarse dirt]], [[stone]], and the regular savanna vegetation.

== Description ==
The extraordinarily rare windswept savanna variant generates in areas with high [[World generation#Biomes|erosion]] and [[weirdness]], as well as medium [[continentalness]] and temperate to high [[Temperature|temperatures]]. It is full of extremely steep mountains, enormous overhangs, [[floating islands]], and huge [[Water|waterfalls]] and [[Lava|lavafalls]], with higher and rougher terrain than the [[Windswept hill|windswept hills]] biome, and can peak at Y=256. [[Acacia Tree|Acacia trees]] can peak up to Y=264. Large and deep lakes often form on the bases of the mountains.

Windswept savanna biomes can often generate standalone bordering other [[biomes]] that aren't just the default savanna, with these biomes usually being temperate or warm. Windswept savannas can't generate in regions with cold or snowy biomes which means that these biomes can be found in extreme terrain. Despite being a highland biome, the [[deep dark]] doesn’t generate under windswept savanna.

Farm animals spawn as warm variants in this biome. [[Armadillo|Armadillos]], [[Horse|horses]] and [[Donkey|donkeys]] still appear like in regular savannas, as do hostile [[zombie horse]]s during the [[nighttime]], making this the only [[Windswept Hills|windswept hills]] biome to contain them. In ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', [[Llama|llamas]] also live here.

The terrain is covered with a mixture of [[Grass Block|grass block]] patches and [[coarse dirt]] patches, with a large amount of exposed [[stones]]. [[Tall grass]] doesn't generate here {{in|java}}. [[Village|Villages]] and [[Pillager outpost|pillager outposts]] cannot generate in this biome.<ref>{{bug|MC-128686||Villages and pillager outposts don't spawn in windswept savannas}}</ref>

The steep generated mountains make this variant almost unsuitable for shelter and even just exploring quite hazardous, due to the sharp cliffs often risking fatal fall damage if not above [[water]]. Additionally, the giant overhangs often reduce skylight on the terrain below them, not only enough to spawn [[hostile mobs]] in daylight, but to produce complete darkness similar to [[Cave|caves]], further adding to the difficulty of this biome.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], windswept savannas use warmish atmospherics, lighting, and color grading similar to [[jungles]], although they use default volumetric [[fog]].
