'''1.11-pre1''' is the first and only pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.11]].<ref name="1.11-pre1-blog">https://www.mojang.com/2016/11/minecraft-111-pre-release-1/</ref> This is the final pre-release released in 2016.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Observer]]s'''
* Changed the front (detecting side) texture to be an "observing face".
** Same texture is used for facing up and down, although facing down: points with the top of the face towards north, and when facing up: points with the top of the face towards south.
** The texture is a hybrid of the rejected observer texture ([[File:Observer (front texture) pBE20160502.png|16px]]) for [[Pocket Edition]], and the previous texture.
* Redstone output side now blinks when it outputs power.

=== Items ===
'''[[Enchanted book]]s'''
* Curse of Vanishing, Unbreaking III and Mending now appear in the tools as well as the combat tab of the [[Creative inventory]].

=== General ===
* Added a warning message for players using Java 7 or 6.
* Cleaned up translation files to no longer use <code>%d</code>.
