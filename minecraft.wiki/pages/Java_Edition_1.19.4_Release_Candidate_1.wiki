'''[[Display]]'''
* Changes to interpolation:
** Interpolation always starts at the beginning on client tick.
** Field {{cd|interpolation_start}} is replaced with {{cd|start_interpolation}}, with a different meaning.
** {{cd|start_interpolation}} describes amount of ticks from the start of next client tick after receiving an update to start of interpolation.
*** For example, value 0 means that interpolation starts at the beginning of next client tick after receiving the update.
** {{cd|start_interpolation}} is not stored in entity data.
*** When using {{cmd|data}} commands, if interpolated value is updated, but {{cd|start_interpolation}} is not present in modified tag, interpolation continues from the time of previous update, but with new values.
