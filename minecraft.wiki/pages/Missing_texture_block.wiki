{{disambiguation}}

The term '''missing texture block''' is ambiguous and discouraged; there are multiple objects which fit this description, but none embody it fully:

* The [[locked chest]] used the missing texture in the versions leading up to its removal
* The [[missing model]] has been and is still used for handling invalid or nonexistent model data

For a list of objects which may be considered a "missing texture block", see [[Java Edition missing texture and model uses#Missing texture]] and [[Java Edition missing texture and model uses#Missing model]].
