A '''cow''' is a [[passive mob]] found in most grassy [[biome]]s and are a source of [[leather]], [[raw beef|beef]], and [[milk]]. They have three variants based on the [[temperature]] of the [[biome]] they spawn in.

== Spawning ==
Cows [[Mob spawning|spawn]] naturally in the [[Overworld]] in most grassy biomes except for [[snowy plains]], [[meadow]]s, [[cherry grove]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, and [[pale garden]]s. They spawn in small herds, with a set spawn rate for each biome. 

Cows also require a well-lit [[grass block]] to spawn on and at least two blocks of space above it.

{{IN|JE}}, herds of four cows spawn on grass blocks. 
Individual cows rarely may spawn after world generation.

{{IN|BE}}, herds of 2–3 cows spawn on grass blocks. 
Individuals regularly spawn on grass after world generation.

Cows sometimes spawn inside animal pens, stables, and butcher house backyards in [[village]]s upon world generation.

{{Control|Using}} [[shears]] on a [[mooshroom]] converts it into a cow.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Variants ===
{{Redirect|Cow variant|the cow variant found in mushroom fields biomes|Mooshroom|the definition of cow variants in data packs|Mob variant definitions#Cow}}
Cows have 3 variants; temperate, cold, and warm. The variant is determined by the biome the cow spawns in.

{{Farm animal variants}}

If a cow is spawned via spawn egg or command in any biome not listed, it spawns as a temperate cow.

== Drops ==
=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} experience orbs upon a successful breeding.

=== On death ===
An adult cow drops:
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Raw Beef|notes=not_burn|quantity=1-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Steak|notes=burn|quantity=1-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Leather|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
*{{xp|1|3}} experience orbs are dropped when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].
Killing a baby cow yields no [[item]]s nor [[experience]].

=== Milking ===
An adult cow can be milked by {{Control|using}} a [[bucket]] on it, yielding a [[milk bucket]].

== Behavior ==
[[File:Minicow.png|thumb|A baby cow, compared to a regular cow.{{until|First Drop 2026}}]]
A cow moos and huffs occasionally while wandering aimlessly, but tends to stay in well lit and grassy places. They avoid water unless following a player and always avoid [[rail]]s and falls that cause [[fall damage|damage]]. If harmed, the cow flees for a few seconds.

Cows follow players holding [[wheat]] within a six block radius.

=== Breeding ===
{{Main|Breeding}}
{{See also|Tutorial:Animal farming}}

Cows follow players holding [[wheat]] but stop following when separated from the player by at least 10{{Only|JE}} or 16{{Only|BE}} blocks. Additionally, baby cows follow adults.

A player can [[breed]] cows by using [[wheat]]. After breeding, a baby cow spawns and 1–7 [[experience]] is generated. The parents cannot be bred again for 5 minutes. The variant of the offspring is inherited from one of the parents and does not depend on the biome they are bred in.

Baby cows take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} wheat. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up. It moves to another adult cow if it is separated from its parent by more than 24 blocks. Baby cows prefer to follow adult cows instead of players holding wheat.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Cow.png|thumb|width=165x165|A temperate cow ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], and {{InUpcoming|be 26.0}}, [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult cow to form a [[jockey]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*Cows in the [[PC Gamer Demo|PC Gamer ''Minecraft'' Demo]] are branded with a 'PCG' logo on their side.
*[[Markus Persson]] stated in a Tumblr post that all "breedable" peaceful mobs displayed traits of both genders and could breed with any other individual of their species.<ref>{{Tumblr|notch|28188312756|Gender in Minecraft|July 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728170757/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft}}</ref> This applies to cows as they have horns and give milk (although there are some cattle breeds wherein females exhibit horns).
