[[File:Zombie chasing villager with hitboxes.png|thumb|right|A [[zombie]] chasing a [[villager]] with their hitboxes visible by using {{Keys|F3 + B}} debug hotkey.]]

A '''hitbox''' defines the physical boundary (or an approximation) of a [[block]] or [[entity]]. Hitboxes are used in the calculations of collisions and targeting.

Unlike with block models, all hitboxes' sizes are hard-coded and cannot be changed independently without modification.

{{IN|je}}, hitboxes can be seen through the {{Keys|F3 + B}} [[debug hotkey]].

== Entity hitboxes ==
=== Bounding box ===
[[File:Entities' hitboxes comparison.png|thumb|right|Several entities with different bounding box sizes next to each other. From left to right, the shortest to tallest: [[chicken]], [[pig]], [[cow]], [[creeper]], [[zombie]], and [[enderman]].]]

An entity's bounding box manages their collision with blocks and other entities. It's also used for detecting hits and other interactions from [[player]]s, [[villager]]s, [[arrow]]s, and other entities. {{IN|JE}}, it's shown as a white color coded hitbox around the entities' [[model]], and moves with the entity but maintains a static orientation without rotating.

When the bounding boxes between two entities overlap, a small force is applied to each entity proportional to the distance between them to push them away from each other horizontally. Because there is no vertical collision, it is possible to put multiple entities in the same block by dropping them in from above.

An entity's bounding box can transform into different shapes depending on certain situations, typically unique to the entity itself. For instance, a [[pufferfish]] when approached by players gradually expands its shape, from unpuffed, to semi-puffed, then to fully puffed. It instantly shrinks its shape back to normal once it cools down. Players can also change their bounding box by [[sneaking]], [[crawl]]ing, [[swim]]ming, [[gliding]], or any other means.

Bounding boxes can be scaled by {{attr|minecraft:scale}} attribute, or for specific entities, like [[interaction]], it can be changed by modifying [[Interaction#Entity data|their entity data]].

=== Eye height ===
[[File:Wither skeleton and villager eye height.png|thumb|right|A [[wither skeleton]] has a taller eye height hitbox (red) than a [[villager]], making it suffocate in the barrier block above it.|alt=]]

The eye height shows an entity's eyes placement. It's used for detecting when an entity is submerged in a [[fluid]] or phasing through a solid block. In this state, the game usually times the entity [[drowning]] or [[suffocating]]. In ''Java Edition'', it's shown as flat red lines typically appearing on entities' eyes or head.

The eye height is also used to determine if two [[entities]] can see and follow each other by their eye contact.<ref name="eye-contact">{{mcnet|how-crawling-came-minecraft|How crawling came to Minecraft|July 21, 2020|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref> A long blue tint placed in-line with the eye height hitbox shows which direction entities are looking ([[view angle]]).

=== Passenger attachment point ===
The passenger attachment point is a hitbox that shows the point where an entity passenger is attached on a [[Transportation|mountable entity]]. It's shown as a small green hitbox. It appears on a mountable entity when it is [[Riding|mounted]] by another entity, and aligns precisely with the bottom side of the hitbox.

== Block hitboxes ==
=== Collision box ===
{{Anchor|Block collision}}

<div>[[File:Fence and gate collision box.png|200px]]</div></div>

|class=nomobile}}
<div class="mobileonly">[[File:Fences_hitboxes_height.png|thumb|[[Fence]]s have a one [[blocks tall]] interaction box, but with 1.5 blocks tall collision box.]]</div>
The collision box manages a block's collision with entities. They are usually shaped in cubes, but some may have different shapes, like [[slab]]s, [[lectern]]s, [[lily pad]]s, [[fence]]s, [[wall]]s, and [[stair]]s.

A collision box may not be present for all blocks; [[non-solid block]]s such as [[grass]], [[sign]], [[button]], [[lever]], and [[torch]] have no collision box.

While most blocks have their collision box identical to their interaction box{{Note|The interaction box is considered with an empty context. Thus, for example, [[light (block)|light]] will always have an empty collision box, even when the entity is holding the light item. However, [[block states]] are still considered}} or an empty collision box if it is a non-solid block, some may have a different collision box compared to their interaction box counterpart. For instance, a [[lectern]]'s collision box does not extend into the upper part of their interaction box, and a [[fence]]'s collision box is a bit taller than their interaction box. The table below shows all the exceptions {{in|JE}}:{{note|In the table, trios like 1×2×3 represent a box in the shape of a cuboid with 1 pixel in X, 2 pixels in Y, and 3 pixels in Z.

{{IN|JE}}, it is possible to visualize the collision boxes by enabling {{cd|[[Debug_renderer#visualize_collision_boxes|visualize_collision_boxes]]}} in the debug renderer. It is also possible to see when the [[debug property]] {{cd|SHAPES}} is enabled, indicated by a dark gray outline.

=== Interaction box ===
<!-- [[Interaction box]] redirects here. -->
[[File:Barrier_Outline_Box_(held).png|thumb|200px|A [[barrier]] block's interaction box is shown when hovered by the [[crosshair]].]]
The interaction box manages block interactions with [[players]], such as block placement, destruction, {{control|use}} actions, etc. When looking at the given block, the interaction box is shown as a black outline around the block's edges; this is especially visible in the [[barrier]] block. The interaction box appears only if the block the player is looking at is inside of the [[interaction range]].

A block's interaction box is usually contained within its own 1×1×1 cube space. However, some blocks, such as the ones reported below, are capable of extending outside of this space.

*The arm of an extended [[piston]] &ndash; specifically the part that protrudes into the piston's block space.<ref>{{bug|MC-124459}}</ref>

* The very top part of a [[lectern]]'s head.{{only|je}} This is particularly noticeable when a block is placed above the lectern, making the lectern's outline overlap with the block.

* The extended top of an opened [[shulker box]].

The interaction box isn't visible when aiming the [[crosshair]] at the part that extends outside of the cube.<ref>{{bug|MC-158827}}</ref>

{{IN|je}}, the interaction box outline is cyan ({{color|#57ffe1}}) with a small black outline if {{UI|Options|Accessibility Settings|High Contrast Block Outlines}} is enabled. When the [[debug property]] {{cd|SHAPES}} is enabled, the interaction box outline is white.

== Miscellaneous hitboxes ==
<!--[[File:Campfire's smoke particles colliding with barrier block.png|thumb|right|160px|Smoke particles passes through [[glass block]], but collides with [[barrier block]].]]
Incorrect. It could collide with the glass!
-->

=== Blocks visual box ===

In most instances where the ''Minecraft'' uses [[w:line_clipping|line clipping]] for detection, it utilizes the collision box and the interaction box of the blocks. For example, when a player tries to interact with a block, the game draws a line from it to the [[interaction range]] and look for the first block whose line intersects its interaction box. And the game draws a line in the direction of movement to find the first collision box to limit movement instead of crossing it.

However, there are five situations in the game where line clipping uses neither the interaction box nor the collision box, instead, the game uses the ''visual box''. The visual box attempts to simulate what a sight would look like; however, most game sight simulations, such as a [[mob AI]] searching for a target, use line clipping with a collision box.

For [[fence]]s, [[mud]], [[snow]], and [[soul sand]] the visual box and the interaction box are identical. For [[copper bars|all copper bars]], [[copper grate]]s, [[glass]], [[glass pane]], [[iron bars]], [[powder snow]], [[stained glass]], [[stained glass pane]], and [[tinted glass]] the visual box are empty. For all other blocks, the visual box and the collision box are identical.

Note that many [[transparent blocks]] have an empty visual box; this is so they can be ignored when drawing a line of sight, because they are transparent. However, not all transparent blocks are ignored; for example, the [[barrier]], [[ice]], and [[leaves]] have a full visual box.

Below are all the uses of the visual box {{in|JE}}:

* '''Third-person view camera:''' To position the [[third-person view]] camera, the game calculates the distance from the player based on the visual box, avoiding collisions with it.

* '''Looking the creaking:''' Visual boxes are used by a [[creaking]] to know if it is in a player's line of sight; if so, it stops. This is different from [[endermen]], which use the collision box to detect when a player is looking at them.

* '''Trial spawner detect player:'''  When the [[trial spawner]] attempts to detect a player to its activation, or detect a player with [[Trial Omen]], the player needs to be looking at the spawner, and for that, a visual box is used. However, if the spawner already has a player in its list of detected players, new players will not need to look at the spawner, unless they want to use the Omen effect to converted the spawenr into [[ominous trial spawner]].

* '''Trial spawner mob spawning:''' When attempting to spawn a mob, the trial spawner checks if the position where it might will spawn is visible starting from the center of the block where it is located. For this, it using the visual box.

* '''Ominous item spawner:''' When an [[ominous item spawner]] spawns on top of an entity (because of a ominous trial spawner), it first defines a point ''p'' as a point between 2 and 5 blocks above the top of the entity's hitbox. After, it creates a liner clipping from the entity to that point ''p'', stopping at the point ''p'' or in a block below of a first block that the visual box was find by the clipping. Note that with this, if an entity is directly below, for exemple, a glass block, the ominous item spawner will be spawned on top of the glass.

=== Particles collision box ===
Some [[Particles_(Java_Edition)|particles]] have physics, for example the [[Campfire#Particles_and_smoke_signals|smoke particles from campfires]]. Particles with physics have a collision box that collides with collision box of blocks. Upon collision, the particle's motion is brought to zero along one of the axes, depending on the direction of the collision.

However, particles are generated regardless of whether their collision box intersects the collision box of a block, and when this happens the particle ignores the collision box. 

A lit [[campfire]] creates smoke particles between 0 and 2 blocks above it, with a [[w:Triangular_distribution#Symmetric_triangular_distribution|symmetric triangular distribution]], by the formula {{cd|pos.getY() + random.nextDouble() + random.nextDouble()}}, when {{cd|pos.getY()}} is the Y coordinates of the campfire and {{cd|random.nextDouble()}} is a random number between 0 and 1. Each particle has a 4×4×4 pixels (0.25×0.25×0.25 blocks) collision box. Therefore, the closer a collision box is above the campfire, the more likely a smoke particle is to pass through it, and when the collision box is at 2.25 blocks or more, no particle will pass through it. 

For example, 71.9% of smoke particles pass through a [[Solid block|full collidable block]] one block above the campfire, 28.1% pass through a top [[slab]] one block above the campfire, 3.13% pass through a full collidable block two blocks above the campfire, only 0.195% pass through a [[cauldron]] two blocks above the campfire, and no particle passes through a top slab two block above the campfire.{{note|1=This calculation was performed using the formula {{math|1-F_X(x-0.25)}}, where {{math|F_X}} is the [[w:Cumulative_distribution_function|cumulative distribution function]] of {{math|X}}, {{math|X}} is the random variable with a triangular distribution with parameters a=0, b=2, c=1, and {{math|x}} is the vertical distance between the campfire and the block collision box. Thus, the probability of a smoke particle passing through a collision box that starts {{math|x>1}} blocks above the campfire is {{math|1-(x-0.25)^2 / 2}} if {{math|x ≤ 1.25}}, {{math|(2.25-x)^2 / 2}} if {{math|1.25 < x < 2.25}}, or 0 if {{math|x ≥ 2.25}}}}

== List of entities' hitbox sizes ==
{{Anchor|List of entities' hitboxes}}

Most [[entities]]' bounding boxes are shaped in {{w|cuboid}}s, and do not always overlap with the [[model]]s of the entities. For example, the [[witch]]'s bounding box does not include the upper part of its hat, and the [[wither]]'s bounding box does not include the two heads on its sides. Because most bounding boxes are cuboids, it is standard to measure them by their '''width''' and '''height''', with both being measured in [[blocks tall]].

=== Base hitbox size ===

Below is a table of every entities' hitboxes, mainly sourced from ''Java Edition'', unless stated otherwise. The list shows sizes of the entities' '''base bounding box''' size; other hitboxes may be noted.<ref group="note">In the game's code, most entities bounding boxes are defined in {{jcp|net.minecraft.world.entity.EntityType}} class. Baby variant of mobs are not defined there, instead typically in [[Entity format#Entity inheritance|each individual mob class]].</ref>

Some entities' hitbox size is marked with "'''Varies'''", this indicates that the entity has variable hitbox sizes, see {{slink||Variable hitbox size}}. For others, "'''None'''" marks that the entity does not have hitbox, and "'''N/A'''" indicates no data is available yet for the entity in the wiki. An empty cell indicates that the entity may not have hitbox or no data is available yet ("'''None'''" or "'''N/A'''").

{{hatnote|Hitbox data are sourced either from in-game or the [[:Category:Entities|entities' articles]].}}

<!-- Go to [[Hitbox/Entities' hitboxes]] page to update the hitbox table data -->
{{/Entities' hitboxes}}
{{clear}}

=== Variable hitbox size ===
{{Anchor|Variable hitbox sizes}}

The size of an entity's hitbox is not necessarily static and may change depending on certain situations. For instance, a player's hitbox gets smaller while crouching, and a pufferfish's hitbox changes while its puffing. Some entities may also spawn in different sizes, like [[slime]], [[magma cube]], and [[salmon]]{{only|be}}.

Below is the list of entities whose hitbox can change sizes given specific situations or states:

== Issues ==
{{issue list|hitbox}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|je}}, the visually shown entity hitboxes that appear when {{keys|F3+B}} sometimes do not render where the hitbox actually is, as it is just highlighting the area relative to the position of the entity that has the hitbox. This can be quite prominent if the player runs {{cmd|tick freeze}} when a mob is moving.
* {{IN|je}}, if an entity has the [[Invisibility]] effect, its hitbox is not visually shown when {{keys|F3+B}} is pressed.
