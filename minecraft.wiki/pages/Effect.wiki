[[File:Mob Effect.png|thumb|width=373x373|Various active effects listed in the [[Creative inventory]] {{in|java}}.]]
An '''effect''' (also known as a '''mob effect''' or '''status effect''') is a condition that affects an [[entity]], either negatively, positively, or neutrally. Effects can be inflicted in various ways throughout the game, including consuming [[potion]]s and some [[food]] items, being in the range of active [[beacon]]s and [[conduit]]s, and being attacked by or close to certain [[mob]]s.

The {{command|effect}} [[command]] allows [[player]]s to inflict effects upon themselves and other [[entities]].

== Behavior ==
[[Entities]] inflicted by an effect experience various changes for a duration of time. For most effects, higher levels increase the [[Potency|strength of the effect]]. As long as the effect is active, effect-dependent [[particles]] emanate from the position of the inflicted entity. Effects provided by [[beacon]]s and [[conduit]]s emit semitransparent particles.[[File:Speed effect.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|An example of an effect displayed in the inventory.]]{{IN|java}}, a [[player]] can open their [[inventory]] to see any current effects afflicted upon them, as well as the levels and duration of each. {{IN|bedrock}}, effects are displayed in a separate screen, which can be opened by pressing {{key|Z}} on a keyboard, pressing {{xbtn|oneview}}/{{psbtn|4touchpad}}/{{psbtn|5touchpad}}/{{nsbtn|minus}} on a controller, or tapping the effect icon when using touch controls.

Any number of different effects (including opposing effects such as [[Strength]] and [[Weakness]]) can be simultaneously active on an entity. However, it is not possible to apply the same effect multiple times, even if they are of different levels. When applying an effect already active on the player, higher levels overwrite lower levels, and higher durations overwrite lower durations of the same level.

{{IN|java}}, when a stronger version of an effect is applied to an entity (excluding the player) that already has a weaker version of the same effect, the weaker effect remains but is hidden. If the weaker effect has a longer duration, the weaker effect will return after the more potent one expires. {{IN|bedrock}}, when a stronger effect overrides a weaker effect, the weaker effect is deleted and does not return.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-74059||When a stronger effect overwrites a weaker effect the weaker effect is gone forever}}</ref>

A [[player]] can remove all of their effects by either drinking a [[milk bucket]], [[dying]], or being saved from death by a [[totem of undying]]. Additionally, [[Poison]] can also be removed by drinking a [[honey bottle]].

Any [[damage]] dealt by effects is classified as [[magic damage]] and completely bypasses [[armor]], making it effective at harming highly armored targets; however, the [[Protection]] enchantment still reduces the damage taken from effects.

== List of effects ==
{{IN|JE}}, positive effects have blue text in potion information and are displayed on the upper row of effects in the [[heads up display|HUD]], while negative effects have red potion text and are displayed in the bottom row. Neutral effects have the blue potion text and are listed with the negative effects in the bottom row in the heads up display. If the effect is a beacon effect, then it also has a blue outline. {{IN|BE}}, negative effect names in potion and tipped arrow tooltips are shown in red; positive and neutral effect names in these contexts, and all effect names in the "Mob effects" screen, are shown in white.

=== Effect colors ===
{{Main|Effect colors}}
Each effect has an associated color, used to represent it in particles, [[potion]]s, and [[tipped arrow]]s. If a potion or tipped arrow stores multiple effects (such as potion/arrow of the Turtle Master, or a custom potion created via [[commands]] {{in|java}}), the colors of each effect are blended together. Entities affected by multiple effects, however, emit particles for each active effect separately, without blending the colors.

=== Effect potency ===
A [[status effect]]'s potency is how strong or effective it is. Some effects do not get stronger as its potency increases, but most do.

It is not possible to apply the same effect multiple times, even if they are of different levels. When applying an effect already active on the player, higher levels overwrite lower levels, and higher durations overwrite lower durations of the same level.

{{IN|Java}}, when a stronger version of an effect is applied to an entity that already has a weaker version of the same effect, the weaker effect remains, but is hidden. The weaker effect returns after the stronger effect expires, if the weaker effect has a longer duration. {{IN|Bedrock}}, when a stronger effect overrides a weaker effect, the weaker effect is deleted and does not return.

==Issues==
{{issue list}}

==Trivia==
*When having multiple effects, the effects' timers are reduced by 1 second each simultaneously, regardless of when the [[player]] took each potion. This is because they use the same "seconds counter" that "ticks" every 20 game ticks to save memory. For example, if the [[player]] drinks one [[potion]] and another different potion that doesn't reset the timer 5.5 (or any non-integer amounts) seconds later, both effects' timers subtract 1 second from both of them simultaneously.
*When a [[creeper]] has an effect and explodes {{in|java}}, it leaves an [[area effect cloud]] for each effect that it had before it exploded.
*Drinking a potion of [[Leaping]] II, a potion of [[Slow Falling]], and a potion of [[Swiftness]] II, the player can jump a 9 [[block]] gap.
*Effects shown on the [[HUD]] disappear when the player is in a [[GUI]].
