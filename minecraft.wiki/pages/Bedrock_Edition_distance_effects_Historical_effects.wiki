|The terrain generation breakdown beyond X/Z ±2,812,333.
|[[File:BE_Terrain_Breakdown_-_Void.png|width=64x64]]
|Areas that are normally high enough to generate jagged peaks or frozen peaks instead generate monolith-like structures that extend all the way to the world height limit, as well as areas that solely contain ice from sea level to the bedrock layer. The exact effects on the terrain differ between 32-bit and 64-bit builds of the game.

In Beta 1.18.0.20 or newer, the terrain breakdown due to inadvertently introduced alongside as a result of the terrain generation rewriting process.
