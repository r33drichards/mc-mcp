'''v0.16.0 alpha''', the first release of the '''[[Boss Update]]''',<ref name=MojangPEPost>[https://www.mojang.com/2016/08/sneak-peek-boss-update-is-coming-to-pocket-and-windows-10 "Sneak Peek: Boss Update coming to Pocket & Win 10"] - Mojang, August 29, 2016</ref> is a major update to [[Pocket Edition]], [[Gear VR Edition]], and the [[Windows 10 Edition]] Beta that was released on October 21 and 25, 2016. It adds many new features, such as [[commands]], [[beacon]]s, [[ocean monument]]s and [[guardian]]s, as well as the [[wither]] and [[elder guardian]].

The update was intended to be released on all platforms on October 12, 2016, when discussed at  [[MINECON 2016]]. However, near the intended release time, a critical bug was discovered, forcing the release to be delayed by a few days. The iOS release did not come out until 4 days after the other platforms' release date due to a long certification process. 

This was the last major update in the [[Bedrock Edition version history#Pocket Edition Alpha|Alpha]] development phase of the game – the next major update, v1.0.0, would mark the full release of ''Pocket Edition'' and its derived versions.
