'''13w06a''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on February 7, 2013<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/02/minecraft-snapshot-13w06a/</ref> which adds the [[minecart with spawner]].

13w06a was reuploaded later on February 7, 2013, to fix a crash on the loading screen<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|299558328336523264|Okay, redownload the snapshot. It's all good now!|7 Feb 13}}</ref> and remove a debugging feature that replaced other [[minecart]]s with minecarts with spawners.

== Additions ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart with spawner]]'''
* NBT structure is 100% the same as with normal mob spawners.
* Not an obtainable item, can only be added as an entity with external editors.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Fence]]s'''
* The [[hitbox]]es of fences with inner corners have changed - they now much more closely match the shape of the fence itself, rather than being its convex hull (a solid cuboid).

'''[[Piston]]s'''
* Now extend instantly if they're not pushing a block.

=== General ===
'''[[Lighting]]'''
* Some new lighting optimizations.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* The hitboxes of fences no longer lose precision at extreme coordinates.

== Fixes ==
