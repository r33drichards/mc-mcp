== Summary ==
The trailer begins on a shot of a [[taiga]], as the [[sun]] rises and the narrator says "let's go to a place, where everything is made of blocks." [[Steve]] appears on a [[beach]], and then wanders through [[plains]] into another taiga, before climbing a [[Windswept Hills|mountain]] and appearing in a [[cave]]. In a cold [[Biome|region]], Steve begins placing planks, slowly building a house with a [[cobblestone]] ceiling and [[glass]] windows, planting a farm as it [[Rain|rains]].

Now appearing in a [[desert]], Steve stands high on a [[Sand|dune]], as the narrator promises "the most significant sandbox you'll ever set foot in." Steve then appears on a castle made of [[Smooth Stone Slab|smooth stone slabs]] and [[netherrack]], before using a [[piston]] to push cobblestone, and riding a [[minecart]]. In a [[forest]], Steve and a [[Player|friend]] are collecting and placing resources respectively. Indoors, Steve crafts an [[Iron Chestplate|iron chestplate]], and rushes out into the [[night]] with a full [[Armor|set]] to fight a [[zombie]]. In the same biome, Steve finds a cave, and spots a [[creeper]] inside. Steve then appears in a forest in daytime, and runs off, concluding the trailer.
