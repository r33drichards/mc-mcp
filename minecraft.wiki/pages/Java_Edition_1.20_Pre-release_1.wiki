'''1.20 Pre-release 1''' (known as '''1.20-pre1''' in the launcher) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.20]], released on May 10, 2023,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-20-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 1|May 10, 2023}}</ref> which brings more parity from {{BE}} and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bed]]s, [[carpet]]s, and [[wool]]'''
* Colored variants can now be dyed any other color.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|data}}'''
* {{cd|string}} data sources now accept negative boundaries, which are interpreted as index counted from the end of the string.

=== General ===
'''[[Damage type]]'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|outside_border|generic_kill}}.
** Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type {{cd|outside_border}} instead of {{cd|in_wall}}.
** Forcibly removing an entity using i.e. the {{cmd|kill}} command now uses damage type {{cd|generic_kill}} instead of {{cd|out_of_world}}.

'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Changed death message used for the {{cmd|link=none|kill}} command.
** Changed from  "<''player''> fell out of the world" to "<''player''> was killed".
* Changed death message used for deaths caused by the world border.
** Changed from  "<''player''> suffocated in a wall" to "<''player''> left the confines of this world".

'''[[Loot table]]'''
* Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic.
** The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables.
** Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence identifier, which means a loot table will produce the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.
** The identifier of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified as a [[resource location]] in a new field called {{cd|random_sequence}}.

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Changes in encoding.
** The file is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback.
** File is now written with UTF-8 encoding.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed {{cd|d=and|pumpkin|melon}} from {{cd|#maintains_farmland}} block tag.
* Added {{cd|d=and|generic_kill|outside_border}} to {{cd|#bypasses_armor}} damage type tag.
* Added {{cd|generic_kill}} to {{cd|d=and|#bypasses_invulnerability|#bypasses_resistance}} damage type tags.
