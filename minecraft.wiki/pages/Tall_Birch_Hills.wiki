The '''tall birch hills''' or '''birch forest hills mutated''' was a rare variant of the [[birch forest]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition.''
== Description ==
Like the other hills biomes, the tall birch hills biome had hillier, rougher terrain, along with the taller birch trees of the [[Old Growth Birch Forest|old growth birch forest]] variant. The hills were steep in this biome, comparable to the [[windswept hills]] biome.

Unlike most hills biomes, this biome used to generate as a 'modified hills' biome, making it much rarer but also bigger in size.

== Mobs ==
Tall birch hills used the same mob spawning chances as birch forests.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
