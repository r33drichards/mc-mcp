Baby mobs are smaller variations of their adult counterparts, having small bodies, relatively big heads (with some exceptions), and faster walking speeds. Their sounds are the same as their adult variants but 50% faster and are pitched up by 6 [[Wikipedia:Semitone|semitones]]. The only exception to this is [[tadpole]]s, which are a wholly unique mob from [[frog]]s. Many baby mobs have different interactions or behaviors compared to their elders, which depend on the mob. For example, baby sheep cannot be [[shear]]ed for their [[wool]]; baby [[cow]]s, baby [[mooshroom]]s, and baby [[goat]]s cannot be [[milk]]ed; and baby [[piglin]]s take [[Gold Ingot|gold]] but do not [[barter]]. Most baby mobs do not drop [[loot]] or [[experience]] when killed, with the exception of items they pick up. The following baby mobs do drop loot and/or experience:
* Baby [[zombie]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s, [[drowned]], [[zombified piglin]]s, and [[zoglin]]s (both loot and experience)
* Baby [[hoglin]]s (only experience)
* Baby [[piglin]]s (only experience, less than adults)

=== Baby-like ===
The following mob is the baby variant of another mob, but is a separate mob, unlike the other babies.
* {{EntityLink|Tadpole}}, baby-like variant of {{EntityLink|Frog}}

== Behavior ==
Most baby animals choose and follow an adult within 8 blocks of the same species, regardless of whether it is their parent. Babies can choose new targets to follow whenever they do not have a valid target, such as when the previous target dies or moves further than 16 blocks away. Tamed baby wolves and baby cats follow their owner if the parent is absent or sitting. Baby animals that do not follow adults consist of:
* [[Tadpole]]s (which do not follow [[frog]]s)
* [[Snifflet]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-260272|||WAI}}</ref>
* Baby [[turtle]]s<ref name="not_follow_adults_je">{{bug|MC-185516|||WAI}}</ref>
* Baby [[ocelot]]s<ref name="not_follow_adults_je" />
* Stray baby [[cat]]s<ref name="not_follow_adults_je" />
* Wild baby [[wolves]]<ref name="not_follow_adults_je" />
* Baby [[rabbit]]s{{Only|Java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-158608|||WAI}}</ref>

Baby mobs that are not animals never follow adult mobs.

[[Ghastlings]] occasionally follow nearby players, most land animals and [[villager]]s within a range of 16 blocks, and they prioritize following players.

== Variants ==
When a baby of a species with different fur/pattern variants is born, they usually inherit the pattern of one of their parents, chosen at random, with some exceptions: 
* In the case of [[sheep]], if the parents have "compatible" colors (meaning that their corresponding [[dye]] items could be combined into a third dye), the baby inherits a mix of the parents' colors. 
* In the case of [[mooshroom]]s, breeding two of the same variant has a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1024</sub> chance to spawn a mooshroom of the opposite variant. Breeding two mooshrooms of differing variants has an equal chance of a baby mooshroom of either type.
* In the case of [[horse]]s, there is a <sup>13</sup>⁄<sub>45</sub> chance of having a random color/markings instead of matching either of its parents.
* In the case of [[axolotl]]s, a baby axolotl bred by a player (not found in the world) has a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1200</sub> chance to be the rare blue variant, with this being the only way to obtain this variant. Otherwise, it inherits the color of one of its parents at random.
* [[Frog]]s do not inherit their variants from their parents. A frog's variant is determined by the biome it matures from a [[tadpole]] in.
* In the case of [[goat]]s, the baby has a 2% chance to be a screaming goat. Similarly, when breeding a normal goat and a screaming goat, the baby has 50% chance to be either one of the two sound variants, and when breeding two screaming goats, the baby will always be a screaming variant.

== Spawning ==
Baby animals can be manually spawned by {{control|using|use}} [[spawn egg]]s on a grown animal{{only|java}}{{upcoming|be 26.0}}. This also works on zombies or variants. Baby animals may also be spawned using the {{cmd|summon}} command with a negative {{code|Age}} tag; for example, using {{cmd|summon sheep ~ ~ ~ {Age:-100} }} spawns a baby sheep at the player's position, that matures in 100 [[tick]]s (5 seconds). For baby mobs that don't grow up like zombies and [[piglin]]s, the {{code|IsBaby:1}} tag is used instead.[[File:Feed graphic for baby.png|alt=picture of two graphs showing grow time relationship of feedings to minutes |border|right|thumb|325x325px|Feed graphic for baby animals in ''Java Edition''.]]

The following mobs have a baby variant, but they cannot breed:
* {{EntityLink|Dolphin}}
* {{EntityLink|Happy Ghast}}
** Ghastlings can be spawned by placing [[dried ghast]]s in [[water]] and waiting.
* {{EntityLink|Mule}}
* {{EntityLink|Piglin}}
* {{EntityLink|Polar Bear}}
* {{EntityLink|Squid}}
** {{EntityLink|Glow Squid}}
* {{EntityLink|Undead|Undead monsters}} ([[zombie]], [[husk]], [[drowned]], [[zombie villager]], [[zombified piglin]], [[zoglin]], [[zombie horse]], [[skeleton horse]], and [[camel husk]])
** Baby variants of the zombie horse, skeleton horse, and camel husk do not spawn naturally and are not obtainable.
*** The baby camel husk only exists {{in|je}}.
* {{EntityLink|Piglin}}
* All of these baby variants [[mob spawning|spawn]] naturally, except for ghastlings.

== Growing up ==
Most baby mobs take 20 minutes to grow up. This can be accelerated by feeding them their breeding item. Green sparkles appear similar to those caused by [[bone meal]]. {{IN|Java}}, each feeding usually reduces the remaining time before the animal grows up by 10%. The less time remains, the less time is saved by each feeding, making it inefficient to feed an animal continuously until it becomes an adult. After the eighth feeding, the time saved by one feeding is less than a minute, as shown in the graph. {{IN|Bedrock}}, each feeding saves 10% of the total time rather than the remaining time, so no more than ten feedings are needed to age up a single baby.

[[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[camel]]s have different mechanics: different breeding items grow babies by different amounts, and each item ages babies by a constant time rather than a percentage of the remaining time.

=== Non-ageable ===
These baby mobs are all [[monster]]s and they do not grow up. The only baby monsters that can grow up are the undead mounts (besides zombie horses {{in|bedrock}}) and baby hoglins.
