'''18w08b''' is the twenty-second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on February 22, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w08a|February 21, 2018}}</ref>, which added three types of [[fish mob]]s and [[fish bucket]]s, a crafting recipe for [[dried kelp block]]s, and changed the [[player]]'s underwater visibility.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Fish bucket]]s'''
* [[File:Bucket of Cod JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Cod bucket]]
* [[File:Bucket of Salmon JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Salmon bucket]]
* [[File:Bucket of Pufferfish JE1.png|32px]] [[Puffer fish bucket]]
* When {{control|used}}, they place a water source block and spawn the corresponding [[fish]] inside it.
** Unused texture for an upcoming "[[clownfish]] bucket" added to the game files.  

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Cod Spawn Egg JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Cod spawn egg]]
* [[File:Salmon Spawn Egg JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Salmon spawn egg]]
* [[File:Pufferfish Spawn Egg JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Pufferfish spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
* Added [[fish]] as mobs.
* They need [[water]] to live. Outside of water, they flop around before suffocating.
* They can be caught with a [[water bucket]].
** [[File:Cod.gif|32px]] [[Cod]]
*** Spawn in [[cold ocean]], normal [[ocean]], and [[lukewarm ocean]] biomes.
*** Swim in groups of up to 9 cod.
** [[File:Salmon.gif|32px]] [[Salmon]]
*** Spawn in [[frozen ocean]], [[cold ocean]] and [[river]] biomes.
*** Swim in groups of up to 6 salmon.
** [[File:Pufferfish small.gif|32px]] [[File:Pufferfish medium.gif|32px]] [[File:Pufferfish large.gif|32px]] [[Puffer fish]]
*** Spawn in [[lukewarm ocean]] and [[warm ocean]] biomes.
*** Inflate themselves when a [[player]] gets near.
*** Cause 7 seconds of [[Poison]] to nearby players.
*** They drop 1 [[pufferfish item]] when killed.

=== General ===
* [[Dried kelp]] can now be crafted into [[dried kelp block]]s, which can be crafted back into dried kelp.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
* Warm and lukewarm oceans now have sand floors.
* Deep warm ocean biomes no longer generate.

=== Gameplay ===
* Changed natural water visibility.
** The longer a player stays underwater, the better they are able to see. (Maximum underwater visibility is given when a player stays underwater for 1 minute)
** The [[Water Breathing]] status effect and [[Respiration]] enchantment no longer grant enhanced vision underwater.
