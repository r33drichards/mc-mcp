[[File:Relic.ogg]]

"Relic" begins with vinyl static and record grain before abruptly bursting out into an upbeat 8-bit tune of low audio quality. The song later uses the main melody of "A Time of Legends" and "The Well of Fate" from the [[Minecraft Legends:Original Game Soundtrack|original soundtrack]] of ''[[Minecraft Legends]]'', played on the same 8-bit synthesizer. Later in the song, a bass is added to the noise. There is slight record grain and pitch warbling throughout the song.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "Relic" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] facing 
into a jukebox playing "Relic", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 14.
