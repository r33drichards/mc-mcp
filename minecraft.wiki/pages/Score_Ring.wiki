The '''score ring''' is a block-like rendering exclusively found in the Glide [[mini game]] in the [[Legacy Console Edition]], which generate as rings that players fly through in score attack mode. It comes in emerald, gold and diamond variants. Despite seeming like a block the cubes that make up a score ring are not blocks and are stored separately from blocks in the world files.

== Rendering ==
Rings made of score ring blocks are found throughout Glide maps in score attack mode, held in the same location depending on the map. Each color of ring block forms a different sized ring: 9×9 block rings are made of green ring blocks, 7×7 block rings are made of yellow ring blocks, and 5×5 block rings are made of blue ring blocks. Due to an oversight, there is an inaccessible green ring in the Body map, which can be seen (but not gone through) if you go out of bounds.

== Usage ==
Flying through rings made of ring blocks in score attack mode earns the player points. Smaller rings earn the player more points: green rings give 3 points, yellow rings give 5 points, and blue rings give 7 points.
