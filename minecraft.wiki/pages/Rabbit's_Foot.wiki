A '''rabbit's foot''' is a [[brewing]] and tempting item obtained from [[rabbit]]s and [[camel husk]] [[husk]] riders.

== Obtaining ==

=== Mob loot ===
Each [[rabbit]] has a 10% chance to drop a rabbit's foot when killed by the [[player]]. This chance can be increased by 3% per level using a [[sword]] enchanted with [[Looting]].

A [[fox]] sometimes spawns with a rabbit's foot in its mouth, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a [[food]] item, which causes the fox to drop the rabbit's foot.

=== Cat gifts ===
