'''Dirt''' is a [[block]] found abundantly in most [[biome]]s under a layer of [[grass block]]s at the top of the [[Overworld]] as well as in [[Ore (feature)|patches]] underground.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break dirt is [[shovel]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Dirt|Shovel}}
Dirt drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Dirt comprises the majority of the upper terrain layers in most Overworld biomes, bridging the gap between [[stone]] and [[grass block]]s in various thicknesses.

There are approximately 1,850 dirt blocks per [[chunk]] in [[plains]], [[forest]], [[snowy plains]], [[jungle]], and [[windswept hills]] biomes. In [[village]]s, dirt generates naturally as part of several different structures. In [[woodland mansion]]s, dirt generates in several types of rooms. Four blocks of dirt generates as part of each [[ancient city]] near the center. Dirt can also generate in [[trail ruins]] and at the base of trees in [[trial chambers]] entrances.

Dirt can generate in the Overworld in the form of [[Ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. Dirt attempts to generate 7 times per [[chunk]] in blobs of size 0–160 at Y=0–160, in all biomes. It can replace [[stone]], [[granite]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], polished granite{{only|be|short=1}}, polished andesite{{only|be|short=1}}, polished diorite{{only|be|short=1}}, [[tuff]]{{only|je|short=1}}, and [[deepslate]]{{only|je|short=1}}.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] that picks up and holds a dirt block drops it upon death.

=== Block drops ===
[[Farmland]], [[dirt path]]s, grass blocks, [[mycelium]], and [[podzol]] drop dirt if broken without [[Silk Touch]]. Farmland and dirt paths{{only|java|short=1}} drop dirt even if broken with Silk Touch.

=== Post-generation ===
[[Farmland]] turns into dirt if either a [[mob]] jumps on it, a solid block is placed over it, or nothing is planted on it and it is not within four blocks of [[water]].

A [[dirt path]] immediately turns into dirt if a solid block is placed over it.

[[Coarse dirt]] can be tilled with a [[hoe]] to become dirt.

Tilling [[rooted dirt]] with a hoe turns it into normal dirt and yields a [[hanging roots]] item.

Grass blocks and [[mycelium]] can die under various circumstances (Most often when a solid, opaque block is placed on top of them). When they die, they turn into dirt.

=== Renewability ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Dirt farming}}
By tilling coarse dirt, the player can convert [[gravel]] into dirt. Two blocks each of gravel and dirt become four blocks of coarse dirt, which can then be placed and tilled. Since gravel is renewable through [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s, this makes a renewable source of dirt.

Another way to obtain renewable dirt makes use of [[moss block]]s. [[Azalea]] converts the moss block below it into rooted dirt when grown into a [[azalea tree|tree]]. {{IN|be}}, most [[sapling]]s will convert the [[Moss Block|moss]] directly below it into dirt, sometimes a minute after it's grown into a tree. {{IN|java}}, large [[spruce tree]]s convert up to about 100 moss blocks into podzol when grown. Since moss can be converted from stone using [[bone meal]], and stone can be renewably generated with water and [[lava]], dirt can be renewably created as long as there is access to water, lava and moss blocks.

A third way to obtain renewable dirt is by buying podzol or rooted dirt from [[wandering trader]]s. However, only 18 blocks of podzol or 10 blocks of rooted dirt can be purchased from each trader, so this method cannot be performed on a large scale.

== Usage ==
Dirt's primary use is for farming, but due to its abundance, it can also be used as a highly available building block or as temporary scaffolding.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Farming ===
Dirt has the ability to grow [[sapling]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[mushroom]]s, [[sweet berries]], and [[bamboo]], which can be planted directly in dirt under appropriate conditions.

Using a [[hoe]] on dirt turns it into [[farmland]], enabling [[wheat seeds]], [[pumpkin seeds]], [[melon seeds]], [[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[beetroot seeds]], [[pitcher pod]]s, and [[torchflower seeds]] to be planted on it.

=== Dirt path ===
{{Control|Using}} a [[shovel]] on dirt turns it into a [[dirt path]].

=== Grass and mycelium spreading ===
{{see also|Grass Block}}
When a dirt block is adjacent to a grass block and is exposed to a [[light]] level of at least 4, it is eventually converted into a grass block at random intervals.

[[Mycelium]] spreads in a similar fashion, but requires a light level of at least 9.

=== Mud ===
{{control|Using}} a [[water bottle]], [[splash water bottle]] or [[lingering water bottle]] will convert the dirt into [[mud]].
