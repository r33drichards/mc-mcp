'''How to Play''' is a guide built into all versions of the [[Legacy Console Edition]]. It is intended to help new ''Minecraft'' players familiarize themselves with the controls of the game, as well as its various features and mechanics. The guide contains 33 pages in total (34 in the ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', and 35 in the ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]''). It can be accessed at any time from the [[title screen]] or the [[pause menu]], under the ''Help & Options'' section.

This article is a reproduction of the game's How to Play guide in its entirety, with some reformatting and internal linking as needed for optimal presentation as a wiki page. The controls shown in the guide vary between different consoles; as such, this article shows the default controls for both Xbox and PlayStation.

=== World of Color Update (Xbox One and Nintendo Switch) ===
{{Empty section}}

== Basics ==
[[Minecraft]] is a game about placing [[block]]s to build anything you can imagine. At night [[monster]]s come out, so make sure to build a shelter before that happens.

Use {{Xbtn|360thumb-right}} <small>(Xbox)</small> / {{Psbtn|3thumb-right}} <small>(PlayStation)</small> to look around.

Use {{Xbtn|360thumb-left}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-left}} to move around.

Press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to jump.

Push {{Xbtn|360thumb-left}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-left}} forward twice in rapid succession to [[sprint]]. While you hold {{Xbtn|360thumb-left}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-left}} forward, you will continue to sprint until you run out of sprint time or have less than {{Hunger|6|16|notag=1}}.

Hold {{Xbtn|360rt}}/{{Psbtn|3r2}} to mine and chop using your hand or whatever you are holding. You may need to [[Crafting|craft]] a [[tool]] to mine some blocks.

If you are holding an item in your hand, use {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}} to use that item or press {{Xbtn|360b}}/{{Psbtn|3circle}} to drop it.

== Multiplayer ==
Minecraft on the ''[console]''{{fn|name=consoletext|

== HUD ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - HUD.png|right|frameless]]

The [[HUD]] shows information about your status; your [[health]], your remaining oxygen, your [[hunger]] level, and your [[armor]] (if you are wearing any).

If you lose some health but have 9 or more {{Hunger|2|16|notag=1}}, your health will automatically replenish. Eating food will replenish your {{Hunger|2|16|notag=1}}.

The [[Experience Bar]] is also shown here. The number shows your current Experience Level, and the bar indicates how many Experience Points are required to increase your Experience Level.<br />
Experience Points are gained by collecting Experience Orbs. You can get Experience Orbs by:
* Killing [[mob]]s
* Mining certain block types
* [[Breeding]] animals
* [[Fishing]]
* Smelting [[ore]] in a [[furnace]]

The hotbar shows the items that are available to use. Use {{Xbtn|360lb}}/{{Psbtn|3l1}} and {{Xbtn|360rb}}/{{Psbtn|3r1}} to change the item in your hand.<br />
Some items can be placed in your [[Dual wield|offhand slot]] for quick use; [[Map]]s will allow you to look at them while using something else, and [[Arrow]]s in the offhand slot will be used first.

== Battle Mini Game ==
[[Battle (mini game)|Battle]] is a frantic last-man-standing fight to the death, where players will have to scavenge the arenas for [[chest]]s containing [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], and [[food]] in order to survive and to have an advantage over other players.<br />
The last player alive, or the player with the most kills when the level time ends, is the winner!

=== Gameplay ===
At the start of the game, the players are placed in a lobby area while other players are joining the game. Once there are a minimum number of players in the lobby, a timer will start; although if all players press {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} to declare themselves ready the game will start immediately.<br />
Once the players enter the first arena, they will be locked to a podium position while everyone is loading and a timer will count down to the start of the game. Once the timer runs out, the players are released from their podiums, but will be invulnerable for a short time to allow them to find a weapon.<br />
After the grace period, the battle begins!<br />
Each round lasts a set time, or until there is only one surviving player. The game will then progress to the next arena, and all of the dead players will respawn.

=== Restrictions ===
In Battle, players are not able to build or mine; it's all about finding the weapons, armor, and food needed to survive!

=== Spectating ===
When a player dies, they will be able to watch the action as a spectator; either by following a surviving player, or by flying around the arena as a [[Bat]], [[Parrot]], [[Vex]], or floating [[head]]!

=== Match Reports ===
At the end of a round, there will be a match report showing the statistics for the round.<br />
Players will be awarded medals for their achievements (or lack of achievements) in the round.

== Tumble Mini Game ==
[[Tumble]] is a fast paced last-man-standing mini game, where players try to destroy the blocks beneath the other players, causing them to fall into [[lava]].<br />
The last player alive in the level is the winner!

=== Gameplay ===
At the start of the game, the players are placed in a lobby area while other players are joining the game. Once there are a minimum number of players in the lobby, a timer will start; although if all players press {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} to declare themselves ready the game will start immediately.<br />
Once the players enter the first arena, the game begins.<br />
Each round lasts a set time, or until there is only one surviving player. The game will then progress to the next arena, and all of the dead players will respawn. Once a single player has won 3 rounds, players will be returned to the lobby.

=== Spectating ===
When a player dies, they will be able to watch the action as a spectator; either by following a surviving player, or by flying around the arena as a [[Bat]], [[Parrot]], [[Vex]], or floating [[head]]!

=== Game Stats ===
At the end of a game, there will be a scoreboard showing the statistics for that game.<br />
Players will be awarded medals for their achievements (or lack of achievements) in the game.

== Glide Mini Game ==
[[Glide (mini game)|Glide]] is a fast paced [[Elytra]] Mini Game. There are 2 variants:<br />
'''Score Attack:'''<br />
Fly through score rings to gain points. The player with the most points is the winner, but you still have to reach the end for your score to count!<br />
'''Time Attack:'''<br />
Speed is of the essence! The player who reaches the end in the fastest time is the winner.

=== Lobby ===
At the start of the game, the players are placed in a lobby area while other players are joining the game. Once there are a minimum number of players in the lobby, a countdown timer will start; although if all players press {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} to declare themselves ready the game will start immediately.

=== Gameplay – General ===
Glide is all about flying without power; you can gain speed by diving, but you'll stall if you climb too steeply.<br />
In Glide you will find Thermals and Speed Boosts. There are 2 types of each:

==== Thermals ====
'''Fixed (White)''': These lift you up to a set height.<br />
<span style="color:#6AFFFF">'''Natural (Blue)'''</span>: These lift you up based on your speed and angle; the longer you stay in a Natural Thermal, the more height you will gain.

==== Speed Boosts ====
<span style="color:#F5F669">'''Directional (Yellow)'''</span>: These boost you in the direction the arrows point.<br />
<span style="color:#FFB800">'''Omni (Orange)'''</span>: These boost you in the direction that you are facing on entering.

=== Gameplay – Score Attack ===
In Score Attack the goal is to score as many points as possible by flying through rings. You still have to reach the end for your score to count.

<span style="color:#1CAE1C">'''Green'''</span> Rings = 3 Points.<br />
<span style="color:#FFFF6A">'''Yellow'''</span> Rings = 5 Points.<br />
<span style="color:#6AFFFF">'''Blue'''</span> Rings = 7 Points.

The player who crosses the finish line with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the tied player with the fastest time wins.

=== Gameplay – Time Attack ===
In Time Attack, the goal is simply to reach the end as quickly as possible. The player with the single fastest time in any of the three rounds is declared the winner!

=== Hurry Up! ===
After any player finishes the course, a timer will start. The timer will be shortened every time another player reaches the end, so hurry up!

=== Solo ===
Glide can also be played Solo in either variant for practice; you can even restart the race by pressing {{Xbtn|360b}}/{{Psbtn|3circle}}, or go back to the last checkpoint by pressing {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}}.

=== Checkpoints ===
When a player dies, they will respawn at the last checkpoint that they reached. Checkpoints are also marked by beacons – passing through a checkpoint will also flash "Checkpoint!" on screen, and play a sound. There is no limit to the number of times you can respawn, but the clock keeps running!

=== Game Stats ===
At the end of a game, there will be a scoreboard showing the statistics for that game.<br />
Players will be awarded medals for their achievements (or lack of achievements) in the game.

== Creative Mode ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Creative Mode.png|right|frameless]]

The [[creative mode]] interface allows any item in the game to be moved into the player's [[inventory]] without the need for mining or crafting the item. The items in the player's inventory will not be removed when they are placed or used in the world, and this allows the player to focus on building rather than resource gathering.<br />
If you create, load or save a world in Creative Mode, that world will have achievements <small>(Xbox)</small> / trophies <small>(PS)</small> and leaderboard updates disabled, even if it is then loaded in Survival Mode.<br />
To [[fly]] when in Creative Mode, press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} twice quickly. To exit flying, repeat the action. To fly faster, push {{Xbtn|360thumb-left}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-left}} forward twice in rapid succession while flying. When in flying mode, you can hold down {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to move up and {{Xbtn|360thumb-right-click}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-right-click}} to move down, or use {{Xbtn|360dpad-up}}/{{Psbtn|3dpad-up}} to move up, {{Xbtn|360dpad-down}}/{{Psbtn|3dpad-down}} to move down, {{Xbtn|360dpad-left}}/{{Psbtn|3dpad-left}} to move left, and {{Xbtn|360dpad-right}}/{{Psbtn|3dpad-right}} to move right.

{{Clear}}

== Inventory ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Inventory.png|right|frameless]]

Press {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}} to view your [[inventory]].

This screen shows the items that are available for use in your hand, and all of the other items that you are carrying. Your [[armor]] is also shown here.

Use {{Xbtn|360thumb-left}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-left}} to move the pointer. Use {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to pick up the item that is under the pointer. If there is more than one item here this will pick them all up, or you can use {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} to pick up just half of them.

You can place items down again by using {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}}. With multiple items on the pointer, use {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to place them all or {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} to place just one.

If the item you are pointing at is armor, you can quick move it to the correct armor slot by pressing {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}}.

It is possible to change the color of [[Leather Armor]] by [[dyeing]] it. You can do this in the inventory menu by picking up the dye you want to use, then pressing {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} while the pointer is over the piece of armor you want to dye.

{{Clear}}

== Chests ==

=== Chest ===
[[File:LCE How to Play - Chest.png|right|frameless]]

Once you have crafted a [[Chest]], you can place it in the world and then open it with {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}} to store items from your [[inventory]].

Use the pointer to move items between your inventory and the chest.

Items in the chest will be stored there for you to swap back into your inventory again later.

{{Clear}}

=== Large Chest ===
[[File:LCE How to Play - Large Chest.png|right|frameless]]

Two chests placed next to each other will be combined to form a Large Chest. This can store even more items.

It is used in the same way as a normal chest.

{{Clear}}

=== Ender Chest ===
[[File:LCE How to Play - Ender Chest.png|right|frameless]]

All [[Ender Chest]]s in a world are linked. Items placed into an Ender Chest are accessible in any other. However, the contents of the Ender Chests are different for each player. This allows players to store items in any Ender Chest, and retrieve them from other Ender Chests in different positions in the world.

{{Clear}}

== Crafting ==

=== Crafting ===
In the [[Crafting]] interface, you can combine items from your [[inventory]] to create new types of items. Use {{Xbtn|360x}}/{{Psbtn|3square}} to open the crafting interface.

Scroll through the tabs at the top using {{Xbtn|360lb}}/{{Psbtn|3l1}} and {{Xbtn|360rb}}/{{Psbtn|3r1}} to select the type of item you wish to craft, then use {{Xbtn|360thumb-left}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-left}} to select the item to craft.

The crafting area shows the items required to craft the new item. Press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to craft the item and place it in your inventory.

Scroll through the tabs on the left using {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}} and {{Xbtn|360rt}}/{{Psbtn|3r2}} to switch between regular crafting, Banner crafting, and Firework crafting.

You can also use the 'Classic Crafting' interface by enabling this option in the Settings/User Interface menu. This will disable the automatic crafting of items, and instead use the method found in the [[Java Edition|Java version]] of Minecraft where you have to manually place ingredients in the right pattern in the grid to produce the item you want. More information on the patterns required is available on the [[Crafting#Complete recipe list|Minecraft wiki<!-- NOTE: The Minecraft Wiki is capitalised as "Minecraft wiki" in-game; do not change this. --> page]].

=== Crafting Table ===
You can craft larger items using a [[Crafting Table]].

Place the table in the world and press {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}} to use it.

Crafting on a table works in the same way as basic crafting, but you have a larger crafting area, and a more varied selection of items to craft.

== Furnace ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Furnace.png|right|frameless]]

A [[Furnace]] allows you to change items by firing them. For example, you can smelt [[Iron Ore]] into [[Iron Ingot]]s in the Furnace.

Place the Furnace in the world and press {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}} to use it.

You need to put some [[fuel]] into the bottom of the furnace, and the item to be fired in the top. The furnace will then fire up and start working.

When your items have been fired, you can move them from the output area into your [[inventory]].

If an item your inventory pointer is over is an ingredient or fuel for the furnace, you can quick move it to the correct slot by pressing {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}}.

{{Clear}}

== Dispenser ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Dispenser.png|right|frameless]]

A [[Dispenser]] is used to shoot out items. You will need to place a switch (for example, a [[lever]]) next to the dispenser to trigger it.

To fill the dispenser with items press {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}}, then move the items that you want to dispense from your [[inventory]] into the dispenser.

Now whenever you use the switch, the dispenser will shoot out an item.

{{Clear}}

== Brewing ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Brewing.png|right|frameless]]

[[Brewing]] [[potion]]s requires a [[Brewing Stand]], which can be built at a [[crafting table]]. Every potion starts off with a [[Water Bottle|bottle of water]], which is made by filling a [[Glass Bottle]] with water from a [[Cauldron]] or water source.<br />
A Brewing Stand has three slots for bottles, so can be used to make three potions at the same time. One ingredient can be used over all three bottles, so always brew three potions at the same time to best use your resources. Brewing Stands need fuel, so you'll need to acquire some [[Blaze Powder]] too.<br />
Putting a potion ingredient in the top position of the Brewing Stand will make a base potion after a short time. This doesn't have any effect by itself, but brewing another ingredient into this base potion will give you a potion with an [[effect]].<br />
Once you have this potion you can add a third ingredient to make the effect last longer (using [[Redstone Dust]]), be more intense (using [[Glowstone Dust]]), or turn into a harmful potion (using a [[Fermented Spider Eye]]).<br />
You can also add [[gunpowder]] to any potion to turn it into a [[Splash Potion]], which can be thrown. The thrown Splash Potion will cause the potion effect to be applied over the entire area that it lands in.<br />
By adding [[Dragon's Breath]] to a Splash Potion, you can make a [[Lingering Potion]] which leaves a gas cloud on the ground when thrown. Anything walking into this cloud will have the potion's effect applied to it.<br />
The source ingredients for potions are :- <!-- [sic] -->

<div style="font-weight:bold">
* [[Nether Wart]]
* [[Spider Eye]]
* [[Sugar]]
* [[Ghast Tear]]
* [[Blaze Powder]]
* [[Magma Cream]]
* [[Glistering Melon]]
* [[Redstone Dust]]
* [[Glowstone Dust]]
* [[Fermented Spider Eye]]
* [[Pufferfish]]
* [[Golden Carrot]]
* [[Rabbit's Foot]]
* [[Dragon's Breath]]
</div>

You'll need to experiment with combinations of ingredients in order to find out all of the different potions that you can make.

{{Clear}}

== Enchantment ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Enchantment.png|right|frameless]]

The [[Experience Points]] collected by picking up Experience Orbs can be used to [[enchant]] [[Sword]]s, [[Bow]]s, [[Axe]]s, [[Pickaxe]]s, [[Shovel]]s, [[Armor]], and [[Enchanted Book|Books]].<br />
When an Enchantable item is placed in the slot below the book in the [[Enchantment Table]], the three buttons to the right of the slot will display some enchantments with their Experience Level cost and [[Lapis Lazuli]] cost.<br />
If you do not have enough Experience Levels or have not provided enough Lapis Lazuli to use some of these, the relevant cost will appear in red; otherwise it will be shown in green.

The actual enchantment applied is randomly selected based on the cost displayed.

If the Enchantment Table is surrounded by [[Bookshelf|Bookshelves]] (up to a maximum of 15), with a one block gap between the Bookcase and the Enchantment Table, [[Standard Galactic Alphabet|arcane glyphs]] will be seen coming from the book on the Enchantment Table and the potency of the enchantments will be increased.

All of the ingredients for an Enchantment Table can be found within the [[village]]s in a world, or by mining and cultivation of the world.

Enchanted Books are used at the [[Anvil]] to apply enchantments to items. This gives you more control over which enchantments you would like on your items.

{{Clear}}

== Anvil ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Anvil.png|right|frameless]]

[[Experience|Experience Levels]] can be used to repair, enchant or rename items with the [[Anvil]].<br />
All items can be renamed, although only items with [[durability]] can be repaired or have [[enchantment]]s from [[Enchanted Book]]s applied to them.<br />
An item can be repaired by placing it in one of the input slots on the left, along with either some raw materials of the item, like [[Iron Ingots]] for an [[Iron Sword]], or combined with another item of the same type.<br />
Combining items is more efficient when done with an Anvil, and additionally, if either of the items were enchanted, the finished product may have enchantments from either of the inputs.<br />
Enchanted Books can apply enchantments to items by combining them at an Anvil if the Book's enchantment is suitable. Enchanted Books can be found in [[Chest]]s within [[Monster_Room|dungeons]], or enchanted from normal [[Book]]s at the Enchantment Table.<br />
There is a chance that the Anvil will be damaged with each use and after enough punishment it will be destroyed.

{{Clear}}

== Farming Animals ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Farming Animals.png|right|frameless]]

If you want to keep your [[animal]]s in one place, build a [[fence]]d area of less than 20×20 blocks and have your animals inside it. This ensures that they will still be there when you come back to see them.

{{Clear}}

== Breeding Animals ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Breeding Animals.png|right|frameless]]

The [[animal]]s in Minecraft can [[breed]], and will produce baby versions of themselves!<br />
To get animals to breed, you will need to feed them with the right food to get them to go into 'Love Mode'.<br />
Feed [[Wheat]] to a [[cow]], [[mooshroom]], or [[sheep]]; [[Carrot]]s or [[Beetroot]] to a [[pig]]; any kind of [[Seeds]] to a [[chicken]]; [[Carrot]]s, [[Golden Carrot]]s, or [[Dandelion]]s to a [[rabbit]]; uncooked [[Fish#Items|fish]] of any kind to an [[ocelot]]; or any kind of [[meat]] to a [[wolf]]; and they'll start looking for another nearby animal of the same species that is also in Love Mode.<br />
When two animals of the same species meet, and both are in Love Mode, they will kiss for a few seconds – then a baby animal will appear. The baby animal will follow their parents for a while before growing into a full sized animal itself.<br />
After breeding, an animal won't be able to enter Love Mode again for about five minutes.<br />
There is a limit to the number of animals it is possible to have in a world, so you may find that animals don't breed when you have a lot of them.

{{Clear}}

== Trading ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Trading.png|right|frameless]]

It is possible to [[trade]] items with [[villager]]s. Each villager has a profession; they can be [[Farmer]]s, [[Butcher]]s, [[Blacksmith]]s, [[Librarian]]s or [[Priest]]s, and this affects the type of items they might trade.<br />
You can find a list of all the trades a villager is offering in the trading menu. A villager may modify or add to its trades whenever a player trades with it, although a trade might become temporarily disabled if it is used too frequently.<br />
Trades usually involve buying or selling a number of items for [[emerald]]s.<br />
If you do not have the items required for a trade, the items are shown in red.

{{Clear}}

== Horses ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Horses.png|right|frameless]]

[[Horse]]s and [[Donkey]]s are found mainly in open [[plains]] and [[savanna]]s. A [[Mule]] is the offspring of a Donkey and a Horse, and cannot [[breed]]. [[Llama]]s can only be found in Savannas and [[Extreme Hills]].<br />
A player can ride any adult Horse, Donkey, Mule, or Llama. Only Horses can be armored, and only Mules, Donkeys, and Llamas can be equipped with saddlebags for transporting items.<br />
By using a [[Lead]] on a Llama, other Llamas will naturally follow and form long caravans that can haul large quantities of items at once. Llamas can also be clothed with [[carpet]]s.

Horses, Donkeys, Mules, and Llamas must be [[tamed]] before they can be used. A player can tame a horse by riding it and staying on while it tries to buck them off. When Love Hearts appear around the horse, it has been tamed and will no longer attempt to throw the player off. To steer a horse, the player must equip it with a [[Saddle]]. Press {{Xbtn|360thumb-right-click}}/{{Psbtn|3thumb-right-click}} to dismount from a horse.

Saddles can be bought from [[villager]]s or found inside [[Chest]]s hidden in the world.<br />
Tame Donkeys, Mules, and Llamas can be given saddlebags by attaching a Chest to them. These saddlebags can then be accessed whilst riding or sneaking.

Horses and Donkeys (but not Mules) can be bred like other animals using [[Golden Apple]]s or [[Golden Carrot]]s. Llamas can be bred using [[Hay Block]]s.<br />
Foals will grow into adults over time, although feeding them [[Wheat]] or Hay will speed this up.

== Beacons ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Beacons.png|right|frameless]]

Active [[Beacon]]s project a bright beam of light into the sky and grant powers to nearby players. They are crafted with [[Glass]], [[Obsidian]], and [[Nether Star]]s (which can be obtained by defeating the [[Wither]]).

Beacons must be placed so that they are in sunlight during the day. Beacons must be placed on [[Beacon#Pyramids|Pyramids]] of [[Block of Iron|Iron]], [[Block of Gold|Gold]], [[Block of Emerald|Emerald]], or [[Block of Diamond|Diamond]].<br />
The material that the Beacon is placed on has no effect on the power of the Beacon.

In the Beacon menu you can select one primary power for your Beacon. The more tiers your pyramid has the more powers you will be able to choose from. A Beacon on a pyramid with at least four tiers also gives the option of either the [[Regeneration]] secondary power or a stronger primary power.

To set the powers of your Beacon you must sacrifice an [[Emerald]], [[Diamond]], [[Gold Ingot]], or [[Iron Ingot]] in the payment slot. Once set, the powers will emanate from the Beacon indefinitely.

{{Clear}}

== Fireworks ==
[[Firework]]s are single-use decorative items that can be launched by hand or from [[Dispenser]]s. They are crafted with [[Paper]] and [[Gunpowder]], but you can also add [[Firework Star]]s to give your Fireworks awesome explosions!<br />
The colors, fade, shape, size, and effects (such as trails and twinkle) of Firework Stars can be customized by including additional ingredients when [[crafting]].

You can craft a Firework or Firework Star in the standard 2×2 Crafting interface, but using a [[Crafting Table]] will let you add more ingredients for more impressive displays.<br />
When in either crafting interface, switch to the Fireworks type by pressing {{Xbtn|360rt}}/{{Psbtn|3r2}} twice.

First, create the Firework Stars you want by adding ingredients with {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}} to change the color, shape, and effect of the Firework Star, then pressing {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to create a Firework Star.
* A [[Dye]] will set the color of the explosion of the Firework Star.
* A [[Fire Charge]], [[Gold Nugget]], [[Feather]], or [[Head|Mob Head]] will set the shape of the explosion.
* A trail or a twinkle can be added using [[Diamonds]] or [[Glowstone Dust]].

Remember that you don't need any Firework Stars to craft a Firework, but they are nice to have.<br />
When you're done, hit {{Xbtn|360rb}}/{{Psbtn|3r1}} to move on.

Next, you can add Fade to as many Firework Stars as you'd like. Select the Firework Star you want to add a Fade to, then add dyes with {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}} to make that Firework Star fade to that color after exploding.<br />
When you've added as much Fade as you like, press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to create the star, then {{Xbtn|360rb}}/{{Psbtn|3r1}} to move to the Firework Rocket Group.

You can choose to add as many Firework Stars as you like to the crafting grid to add them to the Firework.<br />
Filling more slots in the crafting grid with Gunpowder will increase the height at which all of the Firework Stars will explode.

Once you're done, press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to craft your completed Firework!

== Banners ==
[[Banner]]s are highly customizable decorations that can be placed either free standing, or attached to other blocks. To get started with banner crafting, open up a [[Crafting Table]] and switch to the Banners type by pressing {{Xbtn|360rt}}/{{Psbtn|3r2}}.

You'll need some [[wool]] and a [[stick]] to craft the base of your banner; try using dyed wool for a more colorful base. Press {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}} when you have picked your base to start adding patterns.

Next, you can add up to 6 patterns to your banner to make it unique. The last pattern you select will always be on top, so make sure to add your backgrounds first. Remember that nothing is permanent until you press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} Create, so don't be afraid to experiment!

There are loads of patterns to play with, split into five different groups that you can navigate by pressing {{Xbtn|360lb}}/{{Psbtn|3l1}} and {{Xbtn|360rb}}/{{Psbtn|3r1}}.<br />
Every pattern can be added in different colors using dyes, and some patterns require other items too.<br />
Add a pattern by pressing {{Xbtn|360y}}/{{Psbtn|3triangle}}, and when you're done press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} to add the completed Banner to your inventory!

You can also copy a completed banner to a blank banner of the same base color, so don't worry about memorising<!-- The game says "memorising", not "memorizing", despite the rest of the paragraph using American English spellings --> how you made your favorites.

== Hoppers ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Hoppers.png|right|frameless]]

[[Hopper]]s are used to insert or remove items from containers, and to automatically pick up items thrown into them.<br />
They can affect [[Brewing Stand]]s, [[Chest]]s, [[Dispenser]]s, [[Dropper]]s, [[Minecarts with Chests]], [[Minecarts with Hoppers]], and other Hoppers.

Hoppers will continuously attempt to suck items out of a suitable container placed above them. They will also attempt to insert stored items into an output container. If a Hopper is powered by Redstone it will become inactive and stop both sucking and inserting items.

A Hopper tries to output items in the direction it is pointing. To make a Hopper point to a particular block, place the Hopper against that block while [[sneaking]].

{{Clear}}

== Droppers ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Droppers.png|right|frameless]]

When powered by Redstone, [[Dropper]]s will drop a single random item contained within them onto the ground. Use {{Xbtn|360lt}}/{{Psbtn|3l2}} to open the Dropper and then you can load the Dropper with items from your [[inventory]].<br />
If the Dropper is facing a [[Chest]] or another type of container, the item will be placed into that instead. Long chains of Droppers can be constructed to transport items over a distance, but for this to work they will have to be alternately powered on and off.

{{Clear}}

== Nether Portal ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - Nether Portal.png|right|frameless]]

A [[Nether Portal]] allows players to travel between the [[Overworld]] and [[The Nether]]. The Nether can be used to fast-travel in the Overworld; traveling one block distance in The Nether is equivalent to traveling 3 blocks in the Overworld.<br />
This means that if you build a second portal in The Nether and exit through it, you will be 3 times further away from your entry point than the distance that you walked.

A minimum of 10 [[Obsidian]] blocks are required to build a portal, and the portal needs to be at least 5 blocks high by 4 blocks wide.<br />
Portals can be up to 23 blocks high by 23 blocks wide as long as they are rectangular.

Once the frame is built, the portal can be activated by igniting the interior of the frame. This can be done using the [[Flint and Steel]] item, or the [[Fire Charge]] item.

Examples of portal construction are shown in the picture to the right.

{{Clear}}

== The End ==
[[File:LCE How to Play - The End.png|right|frameless]]

[[The End]] is another dimension which can be reached through an active [[End Portal]]. The End Portal can be found in a [[Stronghold]], which is deep underground in the [[Overworld]].<br />
To activate the End Portal, you'll need to put an [[Eye of Ender]] into every [[End Portal Frame]] block that doesn't have one.<br />
Once the portal is active, jump into it to go to The End.

In The End you will meet the [[Ender Dragon]], a fierce and powerful enemy, along with many [[Enderman]]<!-- not Endermen -->. Make sure you are well prepared for the battle before going there!

Atop eight pillars of [[Obsidian]], there are [[Ender Crystals]]<!-- not End Crystals --> that the Ender Dragon uses to heal itself. The first step in the battle is to destroy each of these. The first few can be reached with [[arrow]]s, but several are protected by an [[Iron Bars|Iron Fence]] cage; you will need to build up to them.

While you are doing this, the Ender Dragon will be attacking by flying at you and spitting balls of Ender Acid!<br />
If you approach the [[Egg Podium]] in the centre<!-- not center --> of the spikes, the Ender Dragon will fly down and attack you. This is where you can really do some damage to it!<br />
Avoid the acid breath, and target the Ender Dragon's eyes for the highest damage. If possible, bring some friends into The End to help you with the battle!

Once you are in The End, your friends will be able to see the location of the End Portal within the Stronghold on their [[map]]s, so they can easily join you.

{{Clear}}

== End Cities ==
After killing the Ender Dragon, an [[End Gateway Portal]] will generate. Throwing an [[Ender Pearl]] into the portal will teleport you to an outer End island.<br />
[[End Cities]] spawn on outer End islands, and contain some very valuable loot.

Exploring End islands is dangerous, though, so be sure to pack plenty of food and other useful items like Ender Pearls.

== Elytra ==
[[Elytra]] are an item that can be equipped to allow [[gliding]]. Elytra are equipped in the chest slot, as if they were a piece of [[armor]].

Elytra cannot be crafted, but are found in [[Item Frames]] in rare [[End Ship]]s, guarded by fearsome [[Shulker]]s.<br />
When equipped with Elytra, a player can press {{Xbtn|360a}}/{{Psbtn|3cross}} while falling to start gliding. Note that you need to be quite high to really get the full effect!<br />
While gliding, you can steer by looking around. If you look downwards, you'll move faster – but you'll also hit the ground sooner. If you look upwards, you'll gain some height – but do it for too long and you'll stall, falling instead of rising!<br />
As you fly, your Elytra will lose [[durability]]. You can repair them by combining them with a [[Phantom Membrane]] at an [[Anvil]]. If they break mid-flight you'll fall, so be careful.

== Oceans ==
There are lots of different kinds of [[Ocean]] in Minecraft; they can be [[Warm Ocean|warm]], [[Cold Ocean|cold]], [[Deep Ocean|deep]], or even [[Frozen Ocean|frozen]]!

Each Ocean type has different plant and animal life.<br />
Warm Oceans are filled with beautiful [[Coral reef]]s, teeming with [[tropical fish]]; be careful with Coral though, as it needs water to survive.

Many Oceans will contain [[Shipwreck]]s and [[Underwater Ruins]], filled with [[chest]]s full of powerful loot free for the taking – if you can breathe underwater. You may even find a [[Explorer Map|map]] to [[buried treasure]]!

Only the deepest Oceans may contain [[Ocean Monument]]s, large underwater temples protected by powerful [[Guardian]]s!

== Ocean Mobs ==

=== Fish ===
There are a few types of [[fish]] in Minecraft, each with their own distinct flavor. [[Salmon]] swim up rivers, [[Cod]] travel together in shoals, [[Tropical fish]] have a huge variety of color and species, and [[Pufferfish]] will poison anyone that gets too close!<br />
Fish can even be scooped up in [[Bucket]]s for safe transportation.

=== Squid ===
[[Squid]] casually float about, minding their own business – until attacked, when they squirt out a cloud of ink to escape!

=== Dolphins ===
[[Dolphin]]s are clever and sociable animals that will swim with you if they're nearby. They may even help you go faster!<br />
Feeding [[raw Cod]] to a Dolphin might even make it want to help you in other ways… they know where everything is on the Ocean floor.

=== Sea Turtles ===
[[Sea Turtle]]s travel the Oceans, swimming very far but always returning home to lay their eggs.<br />
Sea Turtles can be bred by feeding them [[Sea Grass]], which can be found on the Ocean floor.

=== Drowned ===
When a [[Zombie]] spends enough time underwater, it becomes one of the [[Drowned]]; a terrifying monster that can swim after its target, or hurl [[Trident]]s if it has found any.<br />
Drowned can drop [[Nautilus Shell]]s, which can be crafted together with a [[Heart of the Sea]] into a [[Conduit]].

=== Guardians ===
[[Guardian]]s are very powerful defenders of [[Ocean Monument]]s that attack with their laser eye beams!<br />
Don't mess with them unless you're sure you're ready!

== Conduit ==
[[Conduit]]s can be crafted with eight [[Nautilus Shell]]s and one [[Heart of the Sea]].<br />
An active Conduit will give nearby players the [[Conduit Power]] Status Effect, which lets them breathe underwater, see in the dark, and mine blocks faster.<br />
Players will only get Conduit Power if they are underwater, or standing in the rain.

To activate a Conduit, place it underwater with every surrounding block also filled with water.<br />
It will also need a frame made of [[Prismarine Block]]s, [[Dark Prismarine Block]]s, [[Prismarine Bricks]], or [[Sea Lantern]]s. It's fine to use a mix.

The frame should be constructed in tight rings around the nine central water blocks, with the Conduit right in the middle. The more blocks used in the frame, the larger the area the Conduit can affect.<br />
Once the frame has the maximum number of blocks (three full rings), the conduit will also attack nearby enemies!

== Scaffolding (PlayStation 4 only) ==
{{Exclusive|PlayStation 4|section=1|nocat=1}}

[[Scaffolding]] can help you create huge structures safely! You can walk inside Scaffolding and stand on it.<br />
If you have a column of Scaffolding you can climb it by standing in the middle and holding the {{Psbtn|4cross}} button.<br />
If you want to climb down again, hold the {{Psbtn|4thumb-right-click}} button.

Scaffolding needs support. You can only place 4 Scaffolding blocks horizontally without them touching a different block.<br />
When you attempt to place the 5th Scaffolding block without proper support, it will fall. Scaffolding can be built up into huge towers very quickly without moving – placing a Scaffolding block on top of another will place it at the very top of the pile, rather than just on top of that block.

When Scaffolding is broken it will also break every Scaffolding block that was being supported by it.<br />
This will let you quickly clean up your Scaffolding by breaking the supporting blocks!

== Raids (PlayStation 4 only) ==
{{Exclusive|PlayStation 4|section=1|nocat=1}}

While exploring the world you may encounter a [[Pillager]] encampment or patrol. Pillagers are always looking for [[village]]s to raid.<br />
[[Pillager Captain]]s carry banners. Killing one will give you the [[Bad Omen]] status effect. Entering a village with the Bad Omen status effect will trigger a [[Raid]], and waves of enemies will start attacking the village!

Defeating all of the raiders will end the Raid, and you will gain the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect.<br />
[[Villager]]s tend to be very grateful to their heros, so be sure to check back with them. You might get a good deal on some [[trades]].

== Banning Levels (Xbox only) ==
{{Exclusive|Xbox 360|Xbox One|section=1|nocat=1}}

If you find offensive content within a level you are playing, you can choose to add the level to your Banned Levels list. If you would like to do this, bring up the Pause menu, then press {{Xbtn|360rb}} to select the Ban Level tooltip. When you attempt to join this level in the future, you will be notified that the level is in your Banned Levels list, and given the option to remove it from the list and continue into the level, or back out.
