'''The Update that Changed the World'''<ref name=mojang>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://mojang.com/2013/10/minecraft-1-7-the-update-that-changed-the-world/|title=Minecraft 1.7: The Update that Changed the World|website=Mojang|author=Dinnerbone|date=October 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=mcupdate>{{citation|url=https://mcupdate.tumblr.com/page/4|title=Minecraft News|website=mcupdate.tumblr.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250424033642/https://mcupdate.tumblr.com/page/4}}</ref> is the name for {{el|je}} [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]], a major update released on October 25, 2013. It added many new features such as a new terrain generator, many new [[biome]]s and biome variations, [[stained glass]], [[red sand]], new [[tree]] types, a new spawn system, new fish and a new fishing system with rewards, many new [[flower]]s, many more customization options, custom-size [[Nether portal]]s up to 23×23, [[minecarts with command block]]s, and many new [[commands]].

Development began two months after [[Java Edition 1.6.2|1.6.2]] was released. Fourteen development snapshots were released, from [[Java Edition 13w36a|13w36a]] to [[Java Edition 13w43a|13w43a]]. Several iterations of the [[launcher]] were released during this time period, from [[Java Edition 1.2.3|1.2.3]] to 1.2.8. Also during the development period, [[Java Edition 1.6.4|1.6.4]] was released. Near the end of the snapshot cycle for the [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]] update, [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] focused primarily on fixing bugs, rather than adding new features.

The official name for the update, "The Update that Changed the World",<ref>{{tweet|dinner|392672150542647296|It's here! 1.7 pre-release!|October 22, 2013}}</ref> was only announced three days prior to the 1.7.2 release on the [[MCUpdate]] tumblr blog<ref name=mcupdate/> (which was displayed in the old launcher).

Mojang released the [[Java Edition 1.7|1.7 pre-release]] on October 22, 2013, the [[Java Edition 1.7.1|1.7.1 pre-release]] on October 23, and the [[Java Edition 1.7.2-pre|1.7.2 pre-release]] on October 25, shortly before the official release of the update.
