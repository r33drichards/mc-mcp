'''Green shrubs''' were variants of the [[short grass]] block ID with block metadata with a value from 3 to 15 inclusive {{in|java}}. Unlike the intentionally-implemented [[shrub]], their color changed depending on the biome. A [[bush]] is the equivalent block in the current game.

== Obtaining ==
When [[Breaking|broken]] normally, green shrubs had a {{frac|1|8}} chance of dropping wheat seeds, due to being a type of grass. This drop rate is affected by [[Fortune]] like normal grass as well. Green shrubs could be obtained as an item using [[shears]].

== Appearance ==
Unlike the normal shrub, which was not tinted per biome, the green shrub was, hence its name. This gives rise to many visually distinct colorations:
