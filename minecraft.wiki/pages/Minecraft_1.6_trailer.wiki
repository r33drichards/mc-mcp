'''Minecraft 1.6 trailer''' is a trailer, promoting the then-upcoming release of [[Java Edition Beta 1.6]], produced by the YouTube channel [[Hat Films]].

== Summary ==
A narrator ponders about the size of the [[Overworld]], as [[djh3max]] is shown stranded on an [[island]]. Sad, the narrator says "some may never see their friends again," as [[Alsmiffy]] sits in a library, surrounded by [[paper]]. Suddenly, the release of the update inspires him to make a [[map]], as it's revealed that the paper came from [[Trottimus]] throwing them down from a hole in the wall.

The scene flashes to Alsmiffy at a crafting table, crafting the paper out of [[Sugar Cane|sugar cane]], dropping several blocks of [[obsidian]], hitting the table with a [[Diamond Pickaxe|diamond pickaxe]], and then actually making a map. Excited by the invention, he goes outside, and begins running around with it, running into a [[cactus]] before resuming hyperfixation. After traveling across many areas trying to fill it up, he promises to help find djh3max's [[pumpkin]] Wilson.

Meanwhile, Trottimus is apparently filming a nature documentary, highlighting a [[pig]] in a [[forest]] and [[Short Grass|foliage]]. Suddenly, Alsmiffy dies to a [[creeper]], leaving several stacks of maps in his place. In a post-credits scene, after a promise the update will come that week, djh3max is still lost. Believing his [[Fire|flame]] is dying out, he ponders for a way to keep it going, when suddenly a map falls out of the sky. Praising [[Markus Persson]] as a god, he throws the map into the fire.
