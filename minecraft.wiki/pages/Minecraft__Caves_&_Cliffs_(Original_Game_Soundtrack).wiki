'''''Minecraft: Caves & Cliffs (Original Game Soundtrack)''''' is the second soundtrack for ''[[Minecraft]]'' by [[Lena Raine]], in collaboration with [[Kumi Tanioka]]. It was released on Spotify on October 20, 2021, followed by other platforms the following day.

The album includes 10 songs for a total length of over 45 minutes. The tracks were implemented as ambient music for the Overworld, with some being mostly exclusive to the new biomes introduced in [[Caves & Cliffs]] as of [[Java Edition 21w42a]] and [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.18.0.22]]. ''otherside'' is implemented as a [[music disc]] in the same update. ''Ancestry'' was later added in [[Java Edition 22w16a]] as music for the deep dark biome.
