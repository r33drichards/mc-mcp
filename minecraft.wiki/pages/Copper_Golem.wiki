A '''copper golem''' is a buildable [[passive mob]] that takes [[item]]s out of [[copper chest]]s, and attempts to store them in nearby wooden [[chest]]s and [[trapped chest]]s. A chest examined by a copper golem must either be empty, or contain the [[item]] type it is holding, for the golem to place anything inside of it. 

If not [[waxed]], a copper golem [[oxidize]]s over time and eventually turns into a [[copper golem statue]], dropping its currently held items.

== Spawning ==
=== Creation ===
{{FakeImage|align=none|style=display:block;float:right;margin:0 1em 1em 0;|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Carved Pumpkin|s=Block of Copper| p | s}}|Copper golem build configuration. The block of copper may be any oxidation stage or waxed state.}}
A copper golem is created by placing a [[block of copper]] of any [[oxidation]] stage, then placing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o’lantern]] on top. The [[pumpkin]] must be placed last, whether by the player, a [[dispenser]], or an [[enderman]]. The building pattern also works horizontally or upside-down, as long as the pumpkin is the final block placed.

On creation, the [[block of copper]] is replaced by a [[copper chest]], and a copper golem spawns at the location of the [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]]. The [[oxidation]] stage of the copper golem and the copper chest matches that of the block of copper used to create it. A [[waxed]] block of copper can also be used, but the golem and the chest are not waxed.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-223868|||WAI}}</ref> If a golem is built with the block of copper placed next to an existing copper chest (that is not already part of a large copper chest), the two chests combine into a large copper chest, just as they would if the new copper chest had been placed manually.

=== Reanimation ===
{{ctrl|Using}} an axe on an unwaxed and unoxidized [[copper golem statue]] causes it to reanimate into a copper golem.

When using a [[copper golem spawn egg]], it spawns the golem on its own, without a [[copper chest]]. A copper golem spawned this way is unoxidized and unwaxed.
{{-}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Copper Ingot|quantity=1-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}}}

=== Shearing ===
When a copper golem has been given a [[poppy]] by an [[iron golem]], it can be [[shear]]ed to drop 1 poppy.

== Behavior ==
When idle, copper golems wander aimlessly while avoiding obstacles and environmental hazards. Copper golems can also open and close non-iron [[door]]s. They occasionally spin their heads or stare at players. They are completely passive to players and other mobs, and run around in a panic if attacked. Unlike most other passive mobs, copper golems do not suspend their behavior when more than 32 blocks from a player.

When in a body of [[water]], copper golems sink to the bottom. They do not swim or [[drown]], but they can still move laterally and step up full [[block]]s as if they were on land, similar to [[iron golem]]s and [[undead]] mobs.

Like iron golems and [[snow golem]]s, copper golems do not take fall damage. However, they still avoid walking off drops that would otherwise cause them harm.

The yellow eyes of copper golems are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]], and the rest of the body is metallic, reflecting all types of light.

=== Chest interactions and item transportation ===
[[File:Copper golem take item BE1.gif|thumb|200px|A copper golem taking an item from a copper chest (the chest is excluded for clarity).]]
If a copper golem is not holding an item, it opens the nearest [[copper chest]] (regardless of its oxidation or waxed status) and attempts to take out up to 16 of the first item it finds. It takes 3 seconds to stop and examine each copper chest it visits. If the copper chest is empty, the copper golem moves on to the nearest copper chest it has not opened. The copper golem can remember up to 9 copper chests that it has previously opened. If it checks 10 copper chests and still cannot find an item, it wanders around for 7 seconds, forgets which copper chests it has opened, and continues searching for a copper chest to take items from.

If a copper golem is holding one or more items, it opens the nearest wooden [[chest]] or [[trapped chest]] and attempts to put the items into it. It takes 3 seconds to stop and examine each chest it opens. If the chest is empty or if the chest contains the same type of item that the copper golem is holding, the golem attempts to add its items to the chest. {{IN|java}}, a copper golem cannot distinguish between different [[potion]] contents, types of [[tipped arrow]]s, or [[suspicious stew]] types, but it can {{in|bedrock}}. In both editions, a copper golem ignores durability, enchantments, shulker box contents, custom names, or any other data. While a copper golem is holding an item, the player can press {{ctrl|use}} on the golem with an empty hand to take the item from it, dropping the item on the ground.

If it cannot add items to a chest, the copper golem moves on to the nearest chest that it hasn't visited. The copper golem can remember up to 9 chests it has previously visited. If it checks 10 chests and still cannot place its items, it wanders around for 7 seconds, forgets which chests it has opened, and continues searching for a chest to put its items in. The copper golem forgets all the chests that it has previously visited when it successfully deposits an item in a chest.

Copper golems cannot see the contents of chests (either wooden or copper) without manually opening and examining them, and do not remember correct item matches.

When a copper golem deposits items in a chest, it attempts to add them to the frontmost available slot. If the deposited item is stackable, it avoids adding to existing stacks in any slot other than the frontmost available one. 

If the chest or copper chest a copper golem is walking toward can no longer be opened (e.g. it has a [[cat]] sitting on it) or is destroyed, the copper golem marks the position as visited and moves on.

Copper golems do not simultaneously open a chest that another non-player entity, such as another copper golem, is already interacting with.

Copper golems search for chests and copper chests in a 65×17×65 cubic area centered on the copper golem's block position. Copper golems can not interact with chests located more than one block above them or more than two blocks below them. However, they try to reach chests if they can find a path. If a chest is two blocks below them, copper golems fall on the chest, even if they can't come back up.

Copper golems interact only with wooden chests, trapped chests and copper chests. They ignore [[Item (entity)|items dropped on the ground]], [[ender chest]]s, [[minecarts with chest]]s, [[barrel]]s, [[boats with chest]]s, and all other containers.

=== Oxidation ===
Non-waxed copper golems have four stages of oxidation (unoxidized, exposed, weathered, and oxidized). Shortly after becoming fully oxidized, a copper golem turns into a [[Copper Golem Statue|statue]]. {{control|Using}} an [[axe]] on an oxidized copper golem removes the oxidation from the golem one stage at a time, as do [[lightning bolt]]s.

Copper golems can be waxed with a [[honeycomb]] to prevent the oxidation from progressing, lightning bolts from removing the oxidization, or fully oxidized golems from turning into statues. Wax can be removed by {{control|using}} an axe on the golem. {{IN|je}}, unlike copper blocks, waxing or unwaxing a copper golem does not grant the "Wax On" and "Wax Off" advancements.<ref>{{bug|MC-300096||Waxing copper golems doesn't grant the advancement "Wax On"|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-300099||Scraping wax off copper golems doesn't grant the advancement "Wax Off"|WAI}}</ref>

A copper golem takes between 7 hours and 7 hours and 40 minutes (420&ndash;460 minutes, or 21&ndash;23 in-game days; plus one tick if the mob is in its initial state or was just scraped with an axe) to oxidize to the next stage. Since the timer is based on [[gametime]], it advances even if the golem is not located in a loaded [[chunk]]. As the mob begins to oxidize (exposed copper golem), it becomes discolored and develops green spots. As the oxidation continues (weathered copper golem), the mob becomes a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized copper golem), the mob is teal with several green spots. Like [[copper bulb]]s, the texture of the eyes of the copper golem dims as it oxidizes. However, the golem itself does not emit any [[light]], regardless of oxidation level.

=== Turning into a statue ===
{{main|Copper Golem Statue}}
Once fully oxidized, a copper golem has a 0.58% chance per [[tick]] to become a [[copper golem statue]] and take a random pose, provided it is ''not'' [[waxed]] and is fully located in [[air]] (that is, a copper golem cannot turn into a statue while underwater or standing on a partial block such as a [[slab]], as part of its hitbox is not located within an air block). This process takes on average 8.62 seconds. During the transformation, any items held by the copper golem are [[drops|dropped]]. If the golem was named using a [[name tag]], it keeps its custom name.

{{control|Using}} an axe on a copper golem statue removes the oxidization one stage at a time. If the statue is unoxidized, scraping it with an axe reanimates it into an unoxidized copper golem.

=== Poppy ===
[[File:Golems with flower.png|thumb|A copper golem with a poppy on its head.]]
[[Iron golem]]s occasionally hold out a [[poppy]], which a copper golem can take and place on top of the rod on its head. Using [[shears]] on the copper golem drops the poppy. Alternatively, it drops when the copper golem turns into a [[copper golem statue]].

Setting the value to <code>-1</code> automatically sets the oxidation time randomly from <code>504000</code> to <code>552000</code> + the current <code>gametime</code>.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The copper golem's original design pitch was made by developer [[Ulraf]].<ref> https://youtu.be/2cxUNoWNy50?t=2542</ref>
* Spinning animation variants for the weathered and oxidized copper golem exist within the animation files, but as of now they share the same animation as the unoxidized spinning animation.
* Sprites of copper golems appeared as an easter egg in the [[2022 Mob Vote Event]], [[2023 Mob Vote Event]], and the [[Eerie Mojang Office Party]] server.
* The copper golem became the second [[community vote]] losing mob to be later added to the game, having lost the [[2021 mob vote]] to the [[allay]], after the [[frog]] and [[mangrove swamp]] content was implemented in [[The Wild Update]].
