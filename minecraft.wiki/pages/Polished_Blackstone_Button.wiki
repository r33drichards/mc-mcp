A '''polished blackstone button''' is a variant of the [[button]] that shares many common properties with [[stone button]]s. Like stone buttons, a polished blackstone button is a non-solid [[block]] that produces a temporary [[redstone]] signal when pressed.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A polished blackstone button is most easily broken with a [[pickaxe]]. It drops itself as an item when broken using any [[tool]].

A button is removed and drops as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed.
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space.{{only|java}}
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

=== Placement ===
Buttons can be placed by {{control|using}} it on a surface.

They can be attached to the side, bottom and top of any full opaque block.

If placed on the top or bottom of a block, the button can face any direction.{{only|java}}

It can also be attached to the top of a fence {{in|be}}.

More information about placement on transparent blocks can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

=== Redstone power ===
A button can be used as a [[monostable]] redstone [[Redstone components#Power components|power source]] (it automatically deactivates shortly after being activated).

Buttons are usually in an inactive state, but can be temporarily activated by players. A polished blackstone button can be activated by a player {{control|using}} it or when hit by a [[Wind Charge|wind charge]]. [[Mob]]s cannot activate buttons directly.

When activated, a polished blackstone button remains active for exactly {{convert|1|second|redstone tick|game tick}}.

While active, a button:
* powers any adjacent [[redstone dust]] to [[Redstone circuit#Power|power level]] 15, including beneath the button
* powers any adjacent [[redstone comparator]]s or [[redstone repeater]]s facing away from the button to power level 15
* strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15
* activates any adjacent [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]], including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.

When a button changes state it provides a [[Redstone circuit#Redstone update|redstone update]] to all redstone components adjacent to itself (including above and below), and to all redstone components adjacent to its attachment block.
