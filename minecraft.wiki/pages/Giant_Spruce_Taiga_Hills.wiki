== Description ==
The giant spruce taiga hills was a variant intended to be a more mountainous version of the {{Abbr|giant spruce taiga|now known as old growth spruce taiga}}, like all other hills biomes. However, both ''[[Java Edition]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' had generation issues.

{{IN|java}}, due to a likely error in the way terrain height is calculated, there was no difference in the terrain between giant spruce taiga and giant spruce taiga hills. Specifically, the game used internal values known as {{code|setBaseHeight}} and {{code|setHeightVariation}} when generating hills biomes, but these values were the same for both giant spruce taiga and giant spruce taiga hills, resulting in no actual difference between the two. This was the only hills biome in the game with this issue.<ref>{{bug|MC-140690||Giant Spruce Taiga Hills has no difference with Giant Spruce Taiga|Fixed}}</ref>

{{IN|bedrock}}, this biome generated as a much hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, even more mountainuous than regular hills biomes.{{Verify|This seems to be the case when comparing many different examples, but is it actually true?}} The hills often reached the generation limit, and the tall trees made this the biome with the second highest blocks (up to Y=158), after the [[Shattered Savanna Plateau|shattered savanna plateau]]. However, this biome generated the same trees as the [[giant tree taiga hills]] (not giant spruce trees, but giant pine trees), making this biome hardly distinctable from the giant tree taiga hills.

== Mobs ==
Giant spruce taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as giant spruce taigas.

The following mobs naturally spawned here:
