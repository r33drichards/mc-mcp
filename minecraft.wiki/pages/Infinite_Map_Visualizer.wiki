'''Infinite Map Visualizer''', also known as '''level previewer''', was a feature which was added in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100616-2210]] as a replacement of [[Indev]]'s [[isometric screenshot]] maker, but later removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.1|Alpha v1.1.1]]. It was exclusive to the browser version of ''[[Minecraft]]''.

The level previewer was hosted on http://minecraft.net/infdev/preview.jsp ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100830063004/http://www.minecraft.net/infdev/preview.jsp archive]), and was removed between September 14 and September 26, 2010.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20101001000000*/http://www.minecraft.net/infdev/preview.jsp</ref> However, it remained in the game's source code until [[Java Edition 12w18a|12w18a]].<ref>{{Citation|url=https://drinkybird.net/2024/09/resurrecting-minecraft-level-previewer/|title=Resurrecting Minecraft's long-dead isometric level previewer|date=4 September 2024|website=drinkybird.net|archive=1|archive-time=20240916091710}}</ref>
