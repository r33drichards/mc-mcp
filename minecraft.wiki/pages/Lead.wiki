'''Leads''' are utility [[item]]s used to leash and lead certain [[entities]]. Leashed entities can be tied to [[fence]]s or other entities by {{Control|using}} the fence/entity while [[sneaking]]. A lead can be removed from an entity by [[shearing]] it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
[[Wandering trader]]s always spawn with 2 [[trader llama]]s, each held with a lead. When a trader llama is detached, either by killing it or the wandering trader, dragging them far apart, using shears, or putting the llama in a [[boat]] or a [[minecart]], the lead drops at the llama's position.

=== Leashing mobs ===
[[File:SuspendedPigs.png|190px|thumb|One block tall mobs, such as pigs, suspend at 7 blocks above the ground.]]
[[File:SuspendedCows.png|190px|thumb|Two block tall mobs, such as cows, also suspend at 7 blocks above the ground.]]

{{control|Using}} a lead on a [[mob]] ties the lead to the mob, allowing it to be moved by the player. Multiple mobs can be held by leads at once, but each mob held requires its own lead. Mobs can also be attached to other mobs with leads.

It is possible to leash the following mobs and other entities:
{{columns-list|colwidth=11em|
* {{EntityLink|Allay}}
* {{EntityLink|Armadillo}}
* {{EntityLink|Axolotl}}
* {{EntityLink|Bee}}

* {{EntityLink|Snow Golem}}
* {{EntityLink|Squid}}
* {{EntityLink|Strider}}
* {{EntityLink|Trader Llama}}
* {{EntityLink|Zoglin}}
}}

These mobs can only be leashed when not hostile:
* {{EntityLink|Nautilus}}
* {{EntityLink|Wolf}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie Nautilus}}

These mobs can only be leashed when not mounted by a hostile mob:
* {{EntityLink|Camel Husk}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie Horse}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie Nautilus}}

Additionally, [[bat]]s, [[panda]]s, [[fish]], [[tadpole]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, [[NPC]]s, [[agent]]s, and monsters other than the ones listed above can be leashed using a map editor or [[NBT]] editor.

With a mob on a lead held by the player, {{control|using}} the lead on any type of [[fence]] attaches the lead to it with a visible knot, tying the mob to it. Multiple leads may be attached to one fence post. A mob tied to a fence tends to stay within 5 blocks of the fence post.

Pressing the {{control|use item}} control on a leash knot will leash any player-leashed mobs to the leash knot, or if the player is not currently leashing any mobs, leash all mobs leashed to the leash knot to the player.

[[Sneaking]] and pressing the {{control|use item}} control on a leashable mob while already having other mobs leashed will leash any leashed mobs to the new mob. If a [[boat]] or any leashable mob that cannot fit into a boat is leashed to a [[happy ghast]] (aside from another happy ghast), it will be attached in a four-leash configuration hanging below the happy ghast.

A lead is broken by pressing the {{control|use item}} control on the leashed mob again, hitting the knot, removing or pushing the attached fence post, or using [[shears]] on a leashed mob or a leash knot. Leads also break when hit by projectiles. Whenever a lead is removed or broken, it drops as an [[item (entity)|item]] at the location of the mob. However, it does not drop when unleashed in Creative mode.{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-79639|MCPE-79639|Unleashing a mob in creative mode drops an unnecessary lead|WF}}</ref> A lead does not break if the attached animal dies.

A lead can stretch a maximum of 12 blocks (16 if the leashed mob is a [[happy ghast]]). If the mob can move toward the player or fence post, it does so. If not, or if the mob is moving quickly away from the player, the lead breaks. The lead also breaks if the player uses a [[firework rocket]] while using [[elytra]].

When the player or the knot is more than 7 blocks above the ground, the mob being leashed becomes suspended.

Most mobs that can be leashed can still be leashed even if attacking the player leashing them, and any attached leads do not break.

[[Wolves]], [[nautilus]]es and [[zombie nautilus]]es cannot be leashed after becoming angry. Despite this, if they become angry while already leashed, the lead does not break, but it cannot be reattached when broken through other methods while the mob is still angry.

A lead does not prevent mobs from despawning if they normally would despawn.

When moving downward and accelerating toward the ground, leashed mobs accumulate fall damage and take it if they hit the ground while still accelerating. When moving up or decelerating (such as when the lead is stretched to its limit), the fall distance is set to one block and the mob therefore does not take any fall damage if it touches the ground.

If the player walks into and back out of a [[nether portal]] while holding a lead connected to a mob, the lead remains attached to the mob. However, if a mob attached to a lead walks into a nether portal, the lead breaks and drops as an item in the other dimension.

A lead can be used to remove a mob from a boat without needing to break the boat, if the mob can normally be leashed.

{{IN|be}}, if a chunk unloads while containing a leashed mob (either by the player walking too far away, or traveling to another dimension via a portal), sometimes the lead breaks and drops as an item, leaving the mob free to wander around.<ref>[[bugtracker:MCPE-157182|MCPE-157182]]</ref>

Boats are unaffected by leads if a player is a direct passenger to a boat. Leads still work on boats with a player riding a mob that is riding the boat.

A leash knot is an [[entity]] created when the [[player]] right-clicks a fence post while having a [[mob]] leashed. It can be destroyed by attacking it, which detaches all [[mob]]s bound to the post and drops the leads.

=== Summoning ===
Using the command {{cmd|summon minecraft:leash_knot <X Y Z>}}, it is possible to summon a leash knot without using a fence. A leash knot spawned this way does not have a leash attached to it.

{{issue list|Lead|Leash|-leading}}

== Trivia ==
[[File:Steve wearing Lead.png|100px]] [[File:Alex wearing Lead.png|100px]]
* The lead is named "leash" in the texture file.
* If a [[player]] goes to sleep while holding a mob on a lead, the lead remains attached.
* {{IN|Java}}, when using the {{cmd|item}} command to put a lead in a player's head slot, the item gets rotated and positioned in such a way that it looks like the player is wearing a monocle.
* {{IN|je}}, when placing a block on a fence and while leashing a mob or boat, the block prevents it from being placed and the leash knot places instead.
