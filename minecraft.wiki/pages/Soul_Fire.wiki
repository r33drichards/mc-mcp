'''Soul fire''' is a dimmer turquoise variation of [[fire]] that is created when [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]] is ignited. Soul fire deals more damage than normal fire and does not spread.

== Obtaining ==
Soul fire cannot be obtained as an item under any circumstances {{in|java}}, though {{in|bedrock}} soul fire may be obtained as an item via inventory editing.

=== Breaking ===
Soul fire is immediately destroyed when broken. When [[shears]] are used to break soul fire, they don't lose [[durability]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Soul fire|any|drop=0|foot=1}}
Soul fire drops nothing when destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Soul fire naturally generates in the [[soul sand valley]] biome in the Nether. It exclusively generates on soul soil; it does not generate on soul sand within either the same biome<ref>{{bug|MC-175325}}</ref> nor in the [[nether wastes]] biome.<ref>{{bug|MC-184561}}</ref>

Soul fire also generates in [[ancient cities]].

{{Block distribution}}

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Soul fire can be placed on [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]] using [[flint and steel]] or a [[fire charge]], and explosions from sources like beds or ghast fireballs can ignite soul fire as well. Unlike regular fire, it can be placed only on the top of a block.

When placed, a soul fire burns and does not extinguish by itself. [[Water]] that touches soul fire extinguishes it.

It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.<ref>{{bug|MC-182709}}</ref>

=== Burning entities ===
[[Player]]s and many [[mob]]s burn when exposed to soul fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly. While inside a soul fire block, the fire inflicts [[damage]] at a rate of {{hp|2}} per tick, twice as many as with the normal [[fire]] (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second) unless the player or mob has [[Fire Resistance]] or a total [[Fire Protection]] of 7 or higher.{{only|bedrock|short=1}} When the player is on fire outside the soul fire block, they take damage at {{hp|1}} per second, the same as with normal fire.<ref>{{bug|MC-170828||Soul fire sets entities on normal fire|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-66081||Soul fire sets entities on normal fire|WAI}}</ref> This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful [[difficulty]], so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the soul fire (stored in a <code>Fire</code> tag shared by all [[entities]]). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by [[powder snow]], [[rain]], [[water]], or a [[cauldron]].

{{See also|Fire#Burning}}

=== Extinguishing ===
Soul fire never extinguishes unless punched or when it receives a block update and finds there is no soul soil or soul sand below it.

Punching or hitting a soul fire block extinguishes it, making the ''Fire extinguished'' sound (see below). Hitting soul fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on soul fire also extinguishes it. Water and lava extinguish soul fires that they flow into, and thrown [[Splash Potion#Splash water bottles|splash]] and [[Lingering Potion|lingering]] water bottles extinguish soul fires in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.<!--{{Info needed|is this also true for soul fire?}} tested in 25w19a-->

Mobs on fire are extinguished when in water or in a [[cauldron]] containing it. In the latter case, one layer of water disappears.

=== Piglins ===
Soul fire repels [[piglin]]s. [[Piglin brute]]s are not repelled by soul fire.

== Trivia ==
* While soul fire was not announced until [[MINECON Live 2019]], a similar-looking blue fire was seen in the spin-off game ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', years earlier.
* Soul fire cannot normally be placed on any other block other than soul sand or soul soil, even if it's placed with {{cmd|setblock}}.{{only|java}} {{IN|Bedrock}}, soul fire can be placed on other blocks with {{cmd|setblock}}.
