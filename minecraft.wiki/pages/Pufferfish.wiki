'''Pufferfish''' are [[Bucket of aquatic mob|bucketable]] aquatic [[neutral mob]]s found in [[ocean]]s. Although they never seek out mobs to attack, they defensively inflate themselves when approached too closely by [[player]]s, [[axolotl]]s, or non-aquatic mobs, dealing damage and inflicting [[Poison]] on them.

== Spawning ==
{{IN|java}}, pufferfish spawn in groups of 1-3 in warm, lukewarm, and deep lukewarm ocean biomes, subject to [[Fish#Spawning|fish spawning requirements]]. If trying to spawn inside a waterlogged solid block, the pufferfish uses the bigger "puffed" size to determine if it collides with anything solid.

{{IN|bedrock}}, pufferfish spawn underwater at around 12–32 blocks away from the player in groups of 3–5 in [[warm ocean]] biomes, and only on the surface; that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top. They are considerably rarer than tropical fish, with only {{frac|1|5}} of fish groups or {{frac|2|9}} individual fish (within the warm ocean biome) spawning as pufferfish.

}}

* {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Unlike other [[fish]], pufferfish don't swim in schools.

Pufferfish inflate themselves when approached by the player, most mobs, including [[tripod camera]]s{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}} and [[armor stand]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-132239|||WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-35807|||WAI}}</ref>

The player may collect a fish by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on it, giving the player a [[bucket of pufferfish]]. Fish placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. {{control|Using}} the bucket against a block empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it. An empty bucket may be used as well.{{only|bedrock}}

Pufferfish can not be bred and only spawn in designated biomes.

=== Weaknesses ===
Like other fish, pufferfish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around like [[guardian]]s for a while until they start suffocating and then die like [[squid]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, they rotate when flopping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.<ref>{{bug|MC-126819||fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fills with water|WF}}</ref>

The [[Impaling]] enchantment affects pufferfish due to being aquatic{{only|java}} or simply being in water{{only|bedrock}}.

Pufferfish are actively hunted down by [[axolotl]]s, [[nautilus]]es and [[zombie nautilus]]es.

=== Defenses ===
A pufferfish inflates when approached by a player in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode, a [[drowned]], an [[axolotl]], or any non-water mob within 2 blocks of its hitbox, going from unpuffed, then semi-puffed, to fully puffed. Going near a semi-puffed or fully puffed pufferfish inflicts the player/mob with three or six seconds of {{EffectLink|Poison}} based on the inflation level, and touching one in its puffed or semi-puffed form deals damage separate from the Poison.

Pufferfish also instantly inflate to their fullest form after taking any kind of damage.{{only|bedrock}} After inflating, they slowly deflate to their normal shape as long as a threat is out of range. If the player/mob leaves the radius while the pufferfish is in its semi-puffed stage, it deflates back to normal.

[[Undead]] mobs are unaffected by the Poison effect, but they still take damage when they come into contact with pufferfish.

A pufferfish that inflicts damage on a mob other than a creeper or a ghast by touching it provokes that mob to retaliate.

In [[Peaceful]] difficulty, pufferfish do not inflict damage or Poison to player.{{only|java}}

Pufferfish can deal damage to players at a longer distance compared to mobs.<ref>{{bug|MC-265281||Pufferfish attack range is inconsistent between mobs and players|WAI}}</ref>

=== Entity data ===
Pufferfish have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.

{{el|java}}:
{{main|Entity format}}
<section begin="entity data"/><div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} Entity data
** {{nbt inherit/entity}}
** {{nbt inherit/mob}}
** {{nbt|byte|FromBucket}}: 1 or 0 ({{cd|true}}/{{cd|false}}) - if {{cd|true}}, the fish has been released from a bucket.
** {{nbt|int|PuffState}}: A value from 0–2.
*** {{cd|0}} means the fish is deflated
*** {{cd|1}} means it is halfway puffed-up
*** {{cd|2}} means it is fully puffed-up
</div><section end="entity data"/>
A pufferfish's damage and Poison time are directly related to its current {{cd|PuffState}} data value, which can be changed using the {{cmd|data}} command.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Pufferfish}}

== Trivia ==
* In real life, pufferfish use their spikes for intimidation purposes and not to inject venom. Their flesh is toxic, which is [[Pufferfish (item)|reflected accurately]] in-game.
* There are three textures for the three different {{cd|PuffState}} data values in ''Minecraft''. A {{cd|PuffState}} value greater than 2 does not visually increase the pufferfish size, but does create a bigger shadow on the ground. All sizes of pufferfish textures are contained in the same texture file.
