An '''old growth birch forest''' or '''birch forest mutated''' is a variant of the [[birch forest]], notable for its trees, which are taller than those found in the normal birch forest.

== Description ==
   
The old growth birch forest features [[Birch|birch trees]], half of which are significantly taller than normal with trunks up to 14 blocks tall. These tall birch trees are exclusive to the old growth birch forest and cannot be grown with a normal birch sapling. [[Bee Nest|Bee nests]] can be found on 0.2%{{Only|Java}} or 0.035%{{Only|Bedrock}} of the trees. Flowers that naturally generate in the biome include the [[Rose Bush|rose bush]], [[Lilac|lilacs]], [[Peony|peonies]], [[Lily of the Valley|lily of the valley]] and the very common [[wildflowers]]. Small patches of up to five [[Bush|bushes]] are also present, and [[Firefly Bush|firefly bushes]] often generate where the biome borders a [[river]].  

Additionally, [[trail ruins]] may generate here as opposed to regular birch forests.  

Old growth birch forests replace birch forests in positive [[World generation#Biomes|weirdness]] and consequently often border rivers as well as their regular biome variant. Uncommonly, they also border [[Forest|forests]], [[plains]], [[Dark Forest|dark forests]], [[Sparse Jungle|sparse jungles,]] mountain [[Grove|groves]], [[Taiga|taigas]], [[Swamp|swamps]], [[Windswept Forest|windswept forests]], [[Windswept Savanna|windswept savannas]] and very rarely [[Old Growth Pine Taiga|old growth pine taigas]], [[Old Growth Spruce Taiga|old growth spruce taigas]], [[Jungle|jungles]], [[Bamboo Jungle|bamboo jungles]] or [[Pale Garden|pale gardens]]. Just like other biomes that generate independently of continentalness and erosion values, old growth birch forests can also generate next to [[Beach|beaches]], [[Stony Shore|stony shores]] and [[ocean]] biomes. They cover about 2.179% of the [[Overworld|Overworld's]] area, making them slightly rarer than birch forests, and only a little more common than dark forests. 

Due to the abundance of birch trees combined with the amount of logs the tall birch trees provide, the old growth birch forest offers a good biome choice for [[Survival]]. Food is also plentiful, as the biome is home to farm animals and honey-producing bees. Furthermore, the leaf canopies of both normal and tall birches are less dense than those of [[Dark oak|dark oak trees]] in dark forests, allowing more sunlight to reach the ground and reducing the number of hostile mobs that can hide from sunlight during daytime.
