== Summary ==

=== Pre-show ===
There was a 15-minute Community Pre-Show before the main event, featuring content creators discussing Minecraft. The hosts who presented the Pre-Show were YouTubers Aimsey and Shadoune666.

=== Tutorial ===
Due to the increasing popularity of ''Minecraft'', an influx of new players are learning about Minecraft for their first time, as noted by [[Jens Bergensten]]. This summons a transition featuring a happy ghast moving upwards to reveal a new excerpt. It is introduced by a new voice, comforting that there is no wrong way to play ''Minecraft'' and then follows on the first few steps to [[craft]] a [[crafting table]] and a [[wooden pickaxe]]. The narrator is then interrupted by a voice call from Jens who warns to not dig straight down but instead is hastily stopped by the narrator and digs straight down anyway. This causes the narrator to fall a large distance and finds himself in a [[trial chamber]]. Havoc is unleashed in the trial chamber, causing the narrator to struggle and pause the game to look online and research how to defeat a mistakenly named [[breeze]]. Following the search, he scrolls pass successive bursts of short-form content admitting he became distracted and forgot his original intention. Finally, he leaves the reimagined version of the Internet, and preaches yet again there is no right or wrong way to play the game, noting the numerous tutorials made by the community if the player ever becomes stuck.

=== The Copper Age ===
After the tutorial, the devs talked about many of the Copper Age features, including what the community has done with the shelf, how they made the sound effects, mentioning "that it has no ambient sound, and that its sounds came from its movements",  and the Copper Golem statue. During this, they showed a list of all the Copper Age features they will add on the 30th. After all of this, they said that the Happy Ghast was cuter than the Copper Golem, cueing the Happy Ghast song.

=== Happy Ghast Music Video ===

{{Expand section}}
A vibrant music video about the [[Happy Ghast]] was played in the livestream.

=== Stories from ''Minecraft'' ===
The segment transitions from a rotating happy ghast and is then voiced by Agnes Larsson, mentioning her surprise with the community's creativeness. Leading from a short, humorous clip, Agnes introduces three individuals whose life involves the usage of Minecraft outside of the game, first beginning with Tee Nuchit.

Tee Nuchit, an aspiring 19-year-old architect from Sweden, firsts describes an anecdote of a friend inviting him to a ''Minecraft'' server. Due to the long distance between the two, Tee wanted to show where he lived and through ''Minecraft'', built his hometown, Falun, except it is set in 1920 CE. He describes the process of building in the game crossing similarities with his sketches of imaginary buildings in real life, which then inspired him to pursue the career of architecture. Without ''Minecraft'', his life "would have have been so much different."

Agnes expresses how the in-game world can be used in a variety of ways, being a "source of inspiration" for the next person, Travess Smalley. An artist from the USA, he creates art that can be "translat[ed] on and off of computers," due to becoming enamoured by the different patterns formed by the rotation of [[glazed terracotta]] in a 4×4 grid which became a theme for some of his works. He continues to describe the game being the stimulus for his ideas describing how the procedural generation of each world caused him to use randomness and chance more in his pieces.

Once again, Agnes describes the limitless opportunities created by ''Minecraft'', revealing an elderly woman from Uruguay. Known online as Aqmadre, she is a ''Minecraft'' streamer who first became exposed to the game through her two sons, both of which are also streamers, where she occasionally appeared in the background of their own streams. This caused a fascination to those interacting in the streamers' communities, asking to introduce who she was. She recalled a moment, when first starting to play, where she encountered a [[creeper]] who then proceeded to explode in front of her, evoking a scream. Later, she reflects her positive experiences with the game and the community, being able to have the chance to help so many people.
