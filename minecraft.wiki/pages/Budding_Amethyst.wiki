'''Budding amethyst''' is a fragile block found in [[amethyst geode]]s that grows [[amethyst cluster]]s over time. It drops nothing if it breaks, and cannot be moved from where it is found. 

== Obtaining ==
Budding amethyst can only be obtained via the [[Creative inventory]] or with [[commands]], as it is unobtainable by [[Survival]] means, even using a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]].

=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break budding amethyst is a [[pickaxe]]. Budding amethyst needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase.

Budding amethyst drops nothing when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Budding amethyst generates naturally as part of [[amethyst geode]]s, replacing 8.3% of the [[blocks of amethyst]] in the innermost layer of the geode.

{{block distribution}}

== Usage ==
=== Growing into amethyst clusters ===
An amethyst bud placed on a budding amethyst (rather than any other block) grows over time, regardless whether it was placed by the player or spawned by the budding amethyst itself. That bud goes through three growth stages – small, medium, and large – before reaching its 4th and final growth stage as an amethyst cluster, which drops [[amethyst shard]]s when mined.

{{IN|Java}}, the below logic can be applied:
#Per [[random tick]], updates will occur to any given block in the loaded chunk every '''68.27''' seconds on average if the chunk center is within 128 blocks of a player's location.
#Choose ''one'' randomly-selected side of the  six-sided block. This random choice is done without considering if growth is possible, so if a direction is chosen that cannot grow an amethyst bud, the random tick does not perform any work.
#There is a 20% chance to either create a new amethyst bud in air or [[Water#Source_blocks|still water]], or to increment the growth stage of an existing amethyst bud, if that bud is attached directly to this block (two adjacent budding amethysts do not speed up growth of a bud between them, as each bud is attached to just one block).
#There are 4 growth stages.
As such, the math can be applied if a player is within random tick range as:

(68.27 seconds average for random ticks) x (20% chance of growth for any given single side) x (6 sides) x (4 growth stages) = 68.27×5×6×4 = 8192 seconds average, also 2 hours 16 minutes 32 seconds, also 6.827 in-game days.

{{IN|Bedrock}} a new amethyst bud can also form in [[flowing water]], removing the water block in the process.

=== Sound ===
Uniquely among other blocks a budding amethyst makes a quiet overlay sound when generally interacted with as well as its block breaking sound when hit with a projectile.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Budding amethyst is destroyed when pushed by a [[piston]]. It cannot be pulled by a [[sticky piston]].

== Trivia ==
* [[JAPPA]] has said the reasoning for the 'x' pattern on the block is because "the plane-crystals grow out of it."<ref>https://twitter.com/JasperBoerstra/status/1331669460126740480</ref>
* According to [[Agnes Larsson]], budding amethyst cannot be obtained without commands in Survival mode because the developers wanted to encourage players to return to the same amethyst geode repeatedly, rather than mining away the budding amethyst and farming it at their home. This functions in a similar way to the [[monster spawner]].<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/taking-inventory--amethyst-shard</ref>
* According to [[Cory Scheviak]], budding amethysts were inspired by [https://coppermind.net/wiki/Atium atium] from the fantasy novel series ''{{w|Mistborn}}''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHTuSFeGGhI&t=1953s</ref>
