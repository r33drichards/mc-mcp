A '''soul sand valley''' is a dry [[biome]] located in [[the Nether]]. It is formed of large caverns with [[Nether fossil]]s and different blocks, mainly including [[soul sand]] and [[soul soil]].

== Description ==
The soul sand valley makes up around 17% of the Nether by volume. It can generate next to any other Nether biome except for the [[warped forest]].

The soul sand valley is mostly composed of [[soul sand]] and [[soul soil]], with [[gravel]] found on its coastlines. [[Soul fire]] is scattered throughout the biome and [[Nether fossil]]s poke out of the terrain. Near these fossils are [[dried ghast]]s. It lacks a diverse set of [[plant]]s, with the only native vegetation being [[crimson roots]] and [[mushroom]]s, although [[crimson fungi]] and [[huge fungi]] may spawn where the biome borders a [[crimson forest]]. Its fog is cyan and the air particles are gray as the sounds of winds and the voices of ghosts fill the air. Giant columns of [[basalt]] called [[basalt pillar]]s can be found stretching from the floor to the ceiling. Caverns, [[Nether fortress]]es and even [[bastion remnant]]s can also be found in the soul sand valley.

[[Glowstone blob]]s can be found in this biome, although they are significantly rarer than in other Nether biomes,<ref>{{bug|MC-171520||Glowstone clusters cannot generate in Soul Sand Valley biomes|WAI}}</ref> since the ceiling of this biome is made of soul sand or soul soil below which glowstone blobs cannot generate; they can still occasionally generate in caves and canyons in this biome,<ref>{{bug|MC-192936||Glowstone clusters generate on netherrack in Soul Sand Valley|WAI}}</ref> because the ceiling is made of [[netherrack]].

== Trivia ==
* Despite its name, the soul sand valley isn’t actually a valley due to its cave-like generation.
* In the official artwork of the [[Nether Update]], a [[wither skeleton]] can be seen in the soul sand valley instead of normal [[skeleton]]s, despite wither skeletons not naturally spawning there.
