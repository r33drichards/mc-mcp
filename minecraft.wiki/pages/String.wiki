'''String''' is an [[item]] that can be used as a [[crafting]] material or placed as '''tripwire''' to allow [[tripwire hook]]s and [[observer]]s to detect [[entities]] that touch it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Tripwire can be {{control|broken}} instantly with any [[tool]], dropping string. Tripwire is also removed and drops string as an [[item]] when:

* [[Water]] flows into its space
* A [[piston]] pushes it or moves a [[block]] into its space

Tripwire is destroyed without dropping string if [[lava]] flows into its space.

A [[cobweb]] drops string when it is broken in these ways (see also {{section link|Cobweb|Usage}}):

* Breaking a cobweb with a [[sword]]
* Pushing a cobweb with a [[piston]]
* [[Water]] breaking a cobweb by flowing over it (flowing [[lava]] destroys cobwebs without leaving string)

=== Natural generation ===
Five pieces of tripwire generate naturally in every [[jungle pyramid]]. Several tripwires can generate inside [[trial chambers]] next to [[dispenser]]s as traps.

=== Mob loot ===

{{Drop sources|String}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|string}}

=== Fishing ===
String has a 0.5% ({{frac|1|200}}) chance of being caught when [[fishing]] with an unenchanted [[fishing rod]]. The chance decreases to 0.4% ({{frac|1|250}}), 0.3% ({{frac|1|333}}), and 0.2% ({{frac|1|500}}) if the fishing rod is enchanted with [[Luck of the Sea]] at enchantment levels I, II, and III, respectively.

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s may [[barter]] 3-9 string with a chance of ~4.26% ({{frac|20|469}}) when given a [[gold ingot]].

=== Cat gifts ===
{{main|Cat#Gifts}}
Tamed [[cat]]s have a 70% chance of giving the [[player]] a gift when they wake up from a [[bed]], and the gift has a 16.13% chance to be a string.

== Usage ==
String can be used as a crafting ingredient and tripwire can be used as a [[redstone circuit]] component. It can also be used to keep [[player]]s from ender-pearling through that space.

String can be placed as tripwire, which detects entities intersecting with it (players, mobs, items, etc.).

; Placement

To place tripwire, {{control|use}} string while pointing at a surface facing the space the tripwire should occupy.

{{Schematic | caption =
'''Tripwire Circuit'''
|SB|th-$w|tw-$ew|tw-$ew|tw-$ew|th-$e|SB
}}
: A line of tripwire blocks can form a simple "circuit" when placed without gaps in a straight line (1 to 40 blocks long) between two [[tripwire hook]]s that face inward toward the tripwire blocks. Multiple tripwire circuits can intersect one another, and the tripwire at each intersection can activate each circuit it belongs to.

; Activation
A tripwire block is activated by any [[entity]] intersecting the tripwire [[hitbox]], except [[spectator]]s and [[AreaEffectCloud|area effect clouds]]. {{IN|Java}}, the following entities also do not activate tripwire: thrown [[eyes of ender]], the [[ender dragon]], [[marker]]s, and [[item]]s clipped into [[solid block]]s. Notably, there are some entities that still activate tripwire despite otherwise ignoring block collisions while moving, such as [[vex]]es{{only|java}}, and thrown [[eyes of ender]]{{only|bedrock}}. Active tripwires ''do not'' produce redstone power, despite their active state being referred to in-game as "powered". An [[observer]] facing a tripwire will pulse whenever it is activated or deactivated, even if it is not attached to any tripwire hooks.

; Behavior{{Info needed|This section may be accurate only for Java Edition}}
When any entity activates an inactive tripwire, the tripwire first [[Block update|updates]] its immediate neighbors, and then searches to the south and west looking for [[tripwire hook]]s to signal to update (no search is done toward the east or north). A search in any given direction is successful if a hook is found fewer than 41 blocks away, is facing toward the updater tripwire, and is connected to the updater tripwire by a continuous line of tripwire blocks.

After these updates are processed, the activated tripwire [[Tick#Scheduled_tick|schedules a block tick]] at its own position to be processed 10 [[game tick]]s later. If the tripwire is still active during this scheduled tick, it checks whether there are any entities that should keep it activated. If there are any, the tripwire stays activated and schedules another block tick on itself for 10 game ticks later. If there are no entities that should keep the tripwire activated, the tripwire deactivates and sends the same updates as when initially activating – namely, a neighbor update and a "south-and-west signal" for tripwire hooks to update. This same set of updates is also sent when tripwire is broken (including by being washed away by spreading [[water]] {{in|java}}).

If any tripwire hook is signaled to update and finds itself to be part of a valid tripwire circuit, it becomes active and produces a redstone signal in much the same way a [[button]] does.

A tripwire hook activates for 5 redstone ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag) when any of its tripwires are destroyed, except when [[shears]] are used to destroy the tripwire.

Tripwire does not prevent mobs from spawning.
