'''Haste''' is a [[status effect]] that increases [[mining efficiency]] and [[attack speed]].{{only|Java}}

== Effect ==
Haste increases attack speed by 10% per level{{only|je}} and increases mining speed by 20% per level{{only|je}} or <math>(1+0.2n)\times1.2^n</math> times of mining speed without Haste{{only|be}} (<math>n</math> represents the level of Haste). Negative levels decrease mining and attack speed, similar to [[Mining Fatigue]].

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Haste.
*All [[mob]]s are unaffected by Haste as they cannot mine blocks.

== Interaction with Mining Fatigue ==
[[Mining Fatigue]] III inflicted by [[elder guardian]]s prevents the player from [[instant mining]] most blocks regardless of the Haste effect, along with a huge decrease of mining speed. However, lower levels of Mining Fatigue can be overcome by Haste of level III or greater, with a resultant reduced Haste effect.

== Notes ==
* Above levels 5, the [[player]]'s arm does not move while mining.
* Haste decreases the charging time of [[sweep attack]].{{only|java}}
* An alternative method of increasing mining speed is the [[Efficiency]] enchantment. Its effects stack with Haste.
