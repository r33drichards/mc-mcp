The '''Humble Bundle Mojam''' was an annual charity event in which the [[Mojang Studios]] team and other developers create a series of collections ("bundles") of video games that are sold and distributed online at a price determined by the purchaser. Sales of bundles are split between the developers/creators, the Humble Bundle operators, and one or more charities including Child's Play, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity: water, and the American Red Cross, with the buyer able to set the revenue split between these groups.

The first Mojam event took place on February 17, 2012 and lasted for 60 hours.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120302112951/http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/humble-bundle-mojam-2/</ref> During this time, [[Mojang Studios]] crafted a brand-new game from scratch, called ''[[Catacomb Snatch]]''. Using the results of a poll in which both the most and least voted for categories were mixed together, the game features an "RTS-shoot 'em up" genre and "steampunk-Ancient Egypt" theme.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120302113908/http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/humble-bundle-mojam/</ref> The Humble Indie Bundle website featured live-stream footage of the development, and took donations; those who donated received access to the game not only once it was completed, but when the developers released stable builds during the event. The bundle also featured ''Fists of Resistance'' from Oxeye Game Studio and ''The Broadside Express'' from Wolfire Games. Oxeye Game Studio's game used the secondary options from the poll, creating a "dungeon crawler-beat 'em up" with a post apocalyptic World War II theme, while Wolfire Games created a game with the same genre and theme as [[Mojang Studios|Mojang Studios']] ''Catacomb Snatch''.<ref>Rose, Mike (15 February 2012).

The 60 hours ended with a total of over $440,000 sales, and over 79,000 bundles sold. However, the sale was temporarily extended, allowing for "last chance" purchases. The sale officially ended with 81,581 bundles distributed for a total of $458,329.98.  All funds were distributed to four charities: Child's Play, Electronic Frontier Foundation, charity: water and the American Red Cross.<ref>Rose, Mike (20 February 2012).
