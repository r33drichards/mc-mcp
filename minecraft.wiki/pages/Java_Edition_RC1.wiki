=== Sound Update ===
Alongside the release of this version, the asset server was updated with the following new sounds:

* The [[chest]] opening and closing now has its own sound, different from the door sound.
* [[Experience orb]]s now make a twinkling sound when collected.
* The entity damage sound has been changed to a genderless bone-cracking sound.
** Players and all mobs make the same bone-cracking sound when taking fall damage.
* Eating and drinking now have sounds.
* [[Blaze]]s have been given an ambient breathing noise.
* [[Endermen]] now have their own sounds instead of using zombie sounds. {{info needed|are these any different to the current sounds?}}
** When they teleport, it sounds like a shortened version of the Nether portal sound.
* [[Magma cube]]s now make sounds.
* [[Silverfish]] now make sounds.
* [[Arrow]] landing was changed to a more twangy sound.{{note|The sound was renamed, meaning older versions of the game still play the old version, unlike the firing sound.}}
* [[Tool]]s and [[armor]] now make a breaking sound, and have a breaking animation.

The following sounds were replaced with new versions on the asset server; thus, the updated sounds also applied to older versions of the game.

* The [[arrow]] firing and thrown item ([[snowball]], [[egg]], [[fishing rod]] and [[eye of ender]]) sound was changed.
* Wooden and iron [[door]]s, [[trapdoor]]s and [[fence gate]]s' opening and closing sounds were changed.
* [[Explosion]]s now have several new, slightly differing sounds instead of just one.

== Fixes ==
'''7 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed wooden door bug from Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6 (sound effect).
* The "Particles" option no longer overlaps the warning when playing on far render distance with a 32-bit Java installation.
* Fixed the bug that caused the player's experience level to revert to 0 again after The End credits are finished from Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6.
* The full names of Scaevolus and Hippoplatimus are now used in the ending credits.
* The player can now chat while entering a portal in multiplayer.
* Obsidian's mining time was increased to 8 seconds from ~3 seconds in 1.9 Prerelease 6.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* When RC2 was initially uploaded, the changing of the version number to RC2 was forgotten, causing it to be displayed as RC1.<ref>{{tweet|notch|135762958759362562|Forgot to change the version number to "RC2". We're professional. :D|November 13, 2011}}</ref> This was later fixed in a reupload.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|135763426105499648|Uploaded new RC2 that says "RC2" \o/|November 13, 2011}}</ref>
* As with [[RC2]], RC1 was released on the latest calendar date out of all release candidates, on November 13.
* Pressing B allows the player to go into Creative mode without cheats.
