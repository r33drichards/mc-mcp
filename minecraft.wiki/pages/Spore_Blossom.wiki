A '''spore blossom''' is a ceiling-hanging decorative block that emits green [[particles]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Spore blossoms can be broken instantly with any [[item]] or by hand. Harvesting a spore blossom with [[shears]] consumes the [[durability]] of the shears for no additional benefit.
{{breaking row|Spore Blossom|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Spore blossoms can be found only on the ceilings of [[lush caves]].

{{Block distribution}}

== Usage ==
Spore blossoms can be placed only on the underside of any block except [[leaves]].

They emit two kinds of particles: one falling straight downwards, disappearing after a certain distance{{info needed|How many blocks?}}; the other spreading to a large area, up to 22 blocks, floating around in the air, spreading further away as they slowly fall down.

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with spore blossoms, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Spore blossoms can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a spore blossom have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Spore blossoms can be put into a [[composter]] with a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
