*** A shortcut to this directory is available via the "Open My Data" button on the telemetry data collection screen.

'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* Makes changes to the "Open to LAN" screen.
* Now allows selecting the port on which to host the LAN world.
* The game mode and allow cheats buttons are now initialized with the default values of the world.

'''[[Music]]'''
* The Wild Update music has been tweaked to be slightly less loud.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Merged the "Minimum" and "Maximum" options for the smooth lighting video setting, since there's no difference between them.

'''Protocol'''
* The network protocol now supports adding player entities to the world without being added to the 'tab' player list.
* Servers can now lazily distribute players' profile public keys along with their first chat packet.
* Message 'headers' within the secure chat protocol no longer need to be distributed when private messages are sent.
* Contextual message references are now deduplicated for efficiency within the Secure Chat network protocol.
* Profile public keys are now refreshed without reconnecting.
* Clients now reset their chat session on receiving a login packet.

'''[[Realms]]'''
* The "Realms News" button now shows a confirmation screen before opening the link.

'''[[Recipe]]s'''
* Many recipe files were made to be formatted more consistently.
* Blocks and items that are crafted using nine of a single item are now considered shapeless recipes, though this has no impact on gameplay.
* Crafting book categories/tabs can now be controlled by recipe definitions.
* Categories available for <code>shaped</code>/<code>shapeless</code> and various special crafting recipes:
** <code>building</code>
** <code>redstone</code>
** <code>equipment</code>
** <code>misc</code> (default)
* Categories available for smelting, <code>blasting</code>, <code>smoking</code>, <code>campfire_cooking</code>
** <code>food</code>
** <code>blocks</code>
** <code>misc</code> (default)
* Some crafting books collapse multiple categories into a single tab.
* The exact mappings might change in the future.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>12</code>.
* Removed "fixers" for resource packs with versions <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> (pre-flattening).
** Game no longer tries to adapt packs with those versions to the current version.
* To improve loading performance, block and item textures are now loaded before they are processed by block and item models.
** By default, textures not in the <samp>textures/item</samp> and <samp>textures/block</samp> directories are no longer automatically recognized and fail to load.
* Can have configuration files now, located in the new <samp>atlases</samp> directory, that control which images are included in the atlases. That directory contains following JSON entries for configuring atlases:
** <code>blocks</code>: textures used by block and item models.
** <code>banner_patterns</code>, <code>beds</code>, <code>chests</code>, <code>shield_patterns</code>, <code>shulker_boxes</code>, <code>signs</code>: used to render some special-case models.
** <code>mob_effects</code>: textures used for effect icons in the UI.
** <code>paintings</code>: textures used for paintings.
** <code>particles</code>: textures used for particles (referenced by the <code>textures</code> field in files within the <samp>particles</samp> directory).
* If multiple packs include those files, they are merged by their order within the pack (same as tags in data packs).
* Inside these files is a JSON object with a single list called <code>sources</code>.
** Every entry in <code>sources</code> runs in during load, in order of definition, adding or removing new files to the texture list; to be later referenced by block models, particles, etc.
* Types of sources:
** <code>directory</code>: lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, across all namespaces.
*** <code>source</code>: directory in pack to be listed (relative to <samp>textures</samp> directory)
*** <code>prefix</code>: string to be appended to the sprite name when loaded.
** <code>single</code>: adds a single file.
*** <code>resource</code>: location of a resource within the pack (relative to <samp>textures</samp> directory, implied <code>.png</code> extension).
*** <code>sprite</code>: sprite name (optional, defaults to <code>resource</code>).
** <code>filter</code>: removes sprites matching the given pattern.
*** <code>namespace</code>, <code>path</code>: patterns (regular expressions, regex) of ids to be removed (only works for entries already in the list), if omitted, any value is matched.
** <code>unstitch</code>: copies rectangular regions from other images.
*** <code>resource</code>: location of a resource within the pack (relative to <samp>textures</samp> directory, implied <code>.png</code> extension)
*** <code>divisor_x</code>, <code>divisor_y</code>: used for determining the units used by regions.
*** <code>regions</code>: list of regions to copy from the source image.
**** <code>sprite</code>: sprite name.
**** <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>: coordinates of the top-left corner of the region.
**** <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>: size of the region.
*** Values such as <code>x</code> are transformed to real image coordinates via dividing by their divisor, and then multiplying by the real image size.
* Example:
** If a pack has a file named <samp>assets/test/textures/fancy/iridium.png</samp> and source is <code>{"type": "directory", "source": "fancy", "prefix": "custom/"}</code>, the texture is available in models as <code>test:custom/iridium</code>.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Various wood types now have unique sounds when placed, broken, or walked on.
** There are three sets of unique sounds: Overworld wood types, Nether wood types, and bamboo.
* Step sounds can now be heard when walking on [[carpet]]s, [[lily pad]]s and [[small amethyst bud]]s.
* Step sounds can now be heard when walking through [[crimson roots]], [[glow lichen]], [[nether sprouts]] and [[warped roots]].

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed {{cd|#non_flammable_wood}} block tag.
* Removed {{cd|#overworld_natural_logs}} item tag.
* Added crimson roots, glow lichen, lily pad, moss carpet, nether sprouts, small amethyst bud, warped roots and {{cd|#wool_carpets}} to the {{cd|#inside_step_sound_blocks}} block tag.

'''Telemetry'''
* Added <code>WorldUnloaded</code> event, and removed client Java version from the <code>WorldLoaded</code> event.
** They are required events.
** Data includes game mode, client or server modded status and game version.
** Can be used to calculate how long the world session has lasted (in seconds and ticks).
** Data from <code>WorldLoaded</code> is sent when a world is launched, and data from <code>WorldUnloaded</code> is sent when a world is shut down (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).
* Added 2 new optional events:
** <code>PerformanceMetrics</code>
*** Data includes frame rates, rendering performance, memory usage, operating system, and the modded status of the client and server.
*** With game version, it can be used to compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.
** <code>WorldLoadTimes</code>
*** Data includes the total time in milliseconds for the world to load, whether this was a new world, as well as game version and platform details.
*** Can indicate what impacts load times when added new features or do larger technical changes.

'''User interface'''
* When tabbing through buttons, tooltips are displayed above or below them.
* Tooltips displayed when hovering are displayed next to the cursor.
* Tooltips from focused buttons (focused by pressing tab) take priority over tooltips from hovered buttons.
* Updated [[knowledge book]] textures on crafting UI and [[tutorial hints]] to the revision updated in the [[texture update]].

'''General'''
* Migrated linear algebra types to Java OpenGL Math Library (JOML).
* Translation files and <samp>pack.mcmeta</samp> are now including non-ASCII characters (encoded as UTF-8) directly instead of using escape sequences.
* Optimized some exceptionally slow cases of structure lookup.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the 1.20 experimental data pack is enabled, the exception to this is the re-addition of [[bundle]]s, which only takes effect when enabling its respective experimental data pack.

* Block of bamboo can be crafted from 9 [[bamboo]] and can be stripped like other wood logs.
* Bamboo planks crafted from block of bamboo yield only 2 planks compared to 4 for wood logs.

'''[[File:Bamboo Button JE3.png|32px]] [[Button]]s, [[File:Bamboo Door JE1.png|32px]] [[door]]s, [[File:Bamboo Fence (EW) JE1.png|32px]] [[fence]]s, [[File:Bamboo Fence Gate JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[fence gate]]s, [[File:Bamboo Planks JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[planks]], [[File:Bamboo Pressure Plate JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[pressure plate]], [[File:Bamboo Sign (0) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[sign]]s, [[File:Bamboo Slab JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[slab]]s, [[File:Bamboo Stairs JE2.png|32px]] [[stairs]], and [[File:Bamboo Trapdoor JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[trapdoor]]s'''
* Added their [[bamboo]] variants.
* Bamboo planks can be crafted using 1 block of bamboo (stripped or unstripped) to craft 2 bamboo planks.

'''{{Animate|Chiseled Bookshelf (S 0) JE2.png; Chiseled Bookshelf (S 63) JE2.png|32px}} [[Chiseled bookshelves]]'''
* Can be crafted with 6 planks and 3 wooden slabs.
* Can store up to 6 books, books and quills, written books, and enchanted books.
** Books in chiseled bookshelves can be added or removed from any slot by targeting the specific slot.

* Do not increase the power of [[enchanting table]]s.
* Require a [[Silk Touch]] axe to mine.

'''{{Animate|Oak Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Spruce Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Birch Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Jungle Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Acacia Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Dark Oak Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Mangrove Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Bamboo Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Crimson Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png; Warped Hanging Sign JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Hanging sign]]s'''
* A more expensive version of normal signs, which can be crafted with 2 [[Iron Chain|chain]]s and 6 [[stripped log]]s, resulting 6 of them.
* Has a total of 10 wood variants: [[Oak Hanging Sign|oak]], [[Spruce Hanging Sign|spruce]], [[Birch Hanging Sign|birch]], [[Jungle Hanging Sign|jungle]], [[Acacia Hanging Sign|acacia]], [[Dark Oak Hanging Sign|dark oak]], [[Mangrove Hanging Sign|mangrove]], [[Bamboo Hanging Sign|bamboo]], [[Crimson Hanging Sign|crimson]], and [[Warped Hanging Sign|warped]].
* Can be hung up in the following ways:
** Underneath a block that provides support in the center, like a fence or an iron bar.
*** When the hanging sign is placed underneath a non-full block, or when placed while sneaking, chains take on an upside-down v-shape. Signs in this configuration can be placed in 16 different angles, similar to an armor stand.
** Underneath a full block.
*** When the hanging sign is placed underneath a full block, chains are on parallel sides of the sign. Signs in this configuration can be placed in the 4 cardinal directions, North, South, East, and West.
** Attached to the solid side of a block.
*** When attached to the side of a block, its chains are parallel, hanging onto a horizontal bar sticking out from the side of said block. Hanging signs in this configuration display text perpendicular to the side of the block they were attached to.
** Attached to the side or underneath another hanging sign.
*** This displays the same way as being placed underneath a non-full block.
* Cannot be placed directly on the ground without support from the side or above.
** However, hanging signs that have a horizontal bar do not break when the supporting block is removed.
* If it is hanging underneath of a block and that block is broken, the hanging sign also breaks immediately.
* Unlike regular signs, the space available for text is much smaller.
* Text can be dyed with any color of dye and tinted with [[glow ink sac]]s to make text glow.

'''[[File:Piglin Head JE1.png|32px]] [[Piglin head]]'''
* [[Piglin]]s now drop their heads when killed by a charged [[creeper]].
* Piglin head flaps its ears when powered by redstone, or when worn by a player while walking, similar to the [[ender dragon]] head.

'''[[Player head]]'''
* Now can contain a {{nbt|string|note_block_sound}} NBT tag.
** Must be a [[resource location]] for a valid sound event.
** When present, this determines the sound a [[note block]] makes when the head is placed on top of it.

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Advancement]]'''
* [[Camel]]s are now required for the "Two by Two" advancement.
* "Glow and Behold!" advancement can be obtained by using a [[glow ink sac]] on a [[hanging sign]] now.
** The description now says "Make the text of any sign glow".
