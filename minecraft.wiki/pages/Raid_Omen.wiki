== Effect ==
When the Raid Omen expires, a [[raid]] begins. {{IN|java}} the center is the position where the player triggered the start of a raid after the Raid Omen expiration. {{IN|bedrock}}, it is the village center. See [[Raid]] for details. 

{{IN|java}}, Raid Omen's potency alters the raid composition and rewards. See [[Raid]] for details.  

Raid Omen is a [[status effect]] and can be removed through all conventional methods, such as drinking [[milk]] or dying.

The player can still receive the Raid Omen effect in Peaceful difficulty via commands (all pillager captains despawn in Peaceful), but does not trigger a raid if in a village.

=== Animation ===
[[File:Raid Omen Bedrock Animation.gif|The [[Bedrock Edition]] animation for the Raid Omen effect activating.|alt=|thumb|280x280px]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, when a player receives the effect, the effect's icon appears on the screen in a short animation, similar to the animation that plays when a [[totem of undying]] activates.

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s, [[ender dragon]]s and [[illager]]s are immune to Raid Omen.
*All mobs except for the [[player]] are unaffected by Raid Omen.

==Trivia==
The immedeate effects of a raid omen are entirely negative (summoning waves of destructive illagers) but the effect is considered neutral. This is probably because defeating a raid results in the positive [[Hero of the Village]] status effect, offsetting the initial negative effects of the raid.
