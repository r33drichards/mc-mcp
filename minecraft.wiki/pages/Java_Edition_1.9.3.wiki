'''1.9.3''' is a minor update to {{JE}} released on May 10, 2016,<ref>{{link|url=https://www.mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-193/||archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-193/|title=Minecraft 1.9.4|author=Searge|website=Mojang.com|date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> which adds the {{cmd|stopsound}} command, limits the Y-value of {{cmd|tp}}, and improves ''Minecraft''{{hairsp}}'s networking libraries. It is not compatible with [[Java Edition 1.9.2|1.9.2]] servers. However, due to an incorrect snapshot warning when loading a world saved in an older version, 1.9.3 was replaced by [[Java Edition 1.9.4|1.9.4]] on the same day.

== Additions ==
=== Commands ===
'''{{cmd|stopsound}}'''
* Permits the player to choose which specific sounds should be stopped from playing.
** Syntax: {{cmd|stopsound <targets> [<nowiki><source></nowiki>] <sound>}}.

== Changes ==
=== Commands ===
'''{{cmd|tp}}'''
* No longer teleports the player to a y-coordinate outside the range &minus;512 to 512.

=== General ===
'''Networking'''
* As of the release of this version, the [http://netty.io Netty] networking library that ''Minecraft'' uses, now checks [https://sessionserver.mojang.com/blockedservers sessionserver.mojang.com/blockedservers] when connecting to a multiplayer server, and if the server is on the blocked server list, it reports to the user that the server is unavailable.
** The blocklist consists of servers in violation of the [https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula Minecraft EULA] (End User License Agreement).
** This affects all versions that depend on the Netty library, back to version [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]] snapshot [[13w41a]].
* Better memory use of pathfinding and [[biome]] caching.
** This prevents memory leaking.
