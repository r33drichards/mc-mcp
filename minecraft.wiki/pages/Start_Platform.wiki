A '''start platform''' is a structure generated when a player enters a [[Mine (dimension) (April Fools' joke)|mine]] in the [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine|25w14craftmine]] snapshot. It comes ready with a [[crafter]] and lever, enabling the player to craft items early game.

== Generation ==
This structure spawns in [[Mine (dimension) (April Fools' joke)|mines]] at the player's spawn point. There is only one start platform per mine. 

== Structure ==
Start platforms match the style of mine exits, using [[Deepslate Tiles|deepslate tiles]], [[stripped pale oak wood]], and [[Resin Bricks|resin bricks]] in the shape of a small hut. Four deepslate pillars hold up the ceiling with a [[shroomlight]] on top to light up the structure.
