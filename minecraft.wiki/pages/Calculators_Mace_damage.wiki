This interactive tool calculates how much damage attacking with a [[mace]] would do when falling from a certain height, measured in blocks.

In the vast majority of cases, any attack performed when falling with a mace is a critical attack, and therefore the option is enabled on this calculator by default. A non-critical falling attack can happen if the attack is performed when the mace's attack cooldown has not reset.

Note that the values are theoretical. Typically, a longer fall distance is required due to players not pressing {{control|attack}} at the exact instant that they are about to land.
