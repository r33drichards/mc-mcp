The '''torch (burnt-out)''' is a joke feature introduced exclusively in [[Java Edition 2.0]]. They are created when a normal [[torch]] burns out.

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
Like a normal torch, a burnt-out torch breaks instantly and drops itself when broken using anything. Tools do not lose durability when used to break burnt-out torches.
{{breaking row|Torch (Burnt-out)|horizontal=1}}
After a normal torch is placed, when it is [[random tick]]ed, it becomes a burnt-out torch.

== Usage ==
Burnt-out torches can be re-lit with [[flint and steel]], turning them back into regular [[torch]]es.
