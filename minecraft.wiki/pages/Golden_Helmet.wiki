A '''golden helmet''' is a variant of [[helmet]] that is crafted from [[gold ingots]]. It is the seventh-highest [[tier]] of helmet, having higher armor points and durability than a [[leather cap]]. Like all [[golden armor]], [[piglin]]s are attracted to golden helmets, and do not attack any player wearing one.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], and [[piglin]]s have a small chance to spawn wearing golden helmets. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

== Usage ==
When worn, a golden helmet provides {{armor|2}} [[armor points]].

=== Piglins ===
As with other pieces of gold armor, [[piglins]] do not attack players wearing golden helmets unless provoked or attacked.

Piglins are also attracted towards golden helmets on the ground and equip them after inspecting them.

A golden helmet can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[gold ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A golden helmet can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a golden helmet, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
