{{Quote|Monty is a gentleman scholar on a mission to unpick the secrets of the world. He’s fascinated by animals and plants, and what delicious things they can be turned into when sufficiently pulped. With his mind focused on these higher things, or his belly, Monty often overlooks the realities of the world around him – like where he is, or the danger that an intriguing specimen of [[the Nether]]’s ecosystem might pose, or the probability that [[Scout]] will stab him if he tries to dissect her pet [[wolf]] again.|[[Marsh Davies]]<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-mags-colourful-characters|Meet the Mag’s Colourful Characters|August 11, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>|image=Marsh Davies Mojang avatar.png}}
