'''Sugar cane''' is a [[plant]] block that generates near water. It is used to craft [[sugar]] and [[paper]], making it an essential resource for making [[book]]s, [[map]]s, and [[firework rocket]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Sugar cane can be mined instantly with anything.

When the spot a sugar cane block is placed in becomes unsuitable, such as when the supporting block is removed, the sugar cane block uproots and drops as an item. When all adjacent water is removed, sugar cane uproots on the next block update or [[random tick]].

A sugar cane block drops itself as an item if a piston tries to push it (trying to pull it does nothing) or moves a block into its space.
{{breaking row|Sugar Cane|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Sugar Canez.png|thumb|250px|Naturally-occurring sugar cane near a river.]]
Sugar cane can generate naturally near [[water]] and [[ice]], as two ({{frac|11|18}} chance), three ({{frac|5|18}} chance), or four ({{frac|2|18}} chance) blocks tall. Rare taller sugar canes can be found if the world generator places two smaller canes on top of each other. It generates in approximately 0.8 sugar cane per chunk seeing as how they only generate near bodies of water.

Sugar canes attempt to generate 10 times in any Overworld biome<ref>All Overworld biomes except {{biomeLink|Frozen Peaks}}, {{biomeLink|Jagged Peaks}},{{biomeLink|Lush Caves}}, {{biomeLink|Mangrove Swamp}}, {{biomeLink|Meadow}} and {{biomeLink|Stony Peaks}} {{in|je}}.</ref>, which requires water. An extra 10 attempts are made in [[swamp]] biomes, and 50 in [[desert]] biomes, which makes sugar cane twice as frequent in swamps and six times as frequent in desert biomes, making the banks of [[river]]s that cut through deserts lined with sugar canes.
Sugar cane cannot generate in caves.<ref>{{bug|MC-214959||Sugar cane generated in cave|Fixed}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-135812||Sugar canes can generate in caves|Fixed}}</ref>

{{block distribution}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell sugar cane for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Sugar cane may be placed only on a [[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[suspicious sand]], [[moss block]], [[Pale Moss Block|pale moss block]], [[mud]] or [[Muddy Mangrove Roots|muddy mangrove roots]] that is directly adjacent to [[water]], a [[waterlogged]] block, or [[frosted ice]] (not merely above or diagonal to water), or on top of another sugar cane block. The adjacent water block can be covered with another block, whether [[opacity|opaque or transparent]], and sugar cane can still be placed and grow next to it. 

=== Farming ===
{{main|Tutorial:Sugar Cane farming}}
[[File:Sugarcane dist.png|thumb|Distribution of the time it takes sugar cane to grow fully (height 1 -> height 3) on Java Edition]]
[[File:Underground Sugar Farm.png|200px|thumb|An underground sugar cane farm.]]

Sugar cane can generate naturally up to any number of blocks tall, but grow only to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top sugar cane block has received 16 random [[Tick#Block tick|block tick]]s (i.e. on average every 18 minutes on ''Java Edition''<!-- Average 68.27 seconds/tick * 16 ticks/growth = 18.2 minutes --> or 54 minutes on ''Bedrock Edition'', but the actual rate can vary widely). 
Sugar cane grows regardless of light level, even in complete darkness.
[[File:4-block tall sugar cane.png|thumb|Naturally generated sugar cane ranging from 2 to 4 blocks tall.]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, [[bone meal]] can be used to instantly grow sugar cane to three blocks. Only one bone meal is consumed. {{IN|java}}, bone meal cannot be used on sugar cane.<ref>{{bug|MC-73963||Can't use bone meal on cacti or sugar cane|WAI}}</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Placing sugar cane into a [[composter]] has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Sugar cane is destroyed when a piston tries to push it. It can not be pulled by pistons.

=== Biome colors ===
The [[Block colors|coloration]] of sugar cane is dependent on the [[biome]] they are in. A block always uses the color set to its location, regardless of how it was placed or of its source.

{{IN|BE}}, biome colors also appear on [[Map|maps]].<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|130658|Grass/foliage colors on maps still use the colors from Alpha v1.1.2_01 and earlier / do not change color with biomes|June 2, 2018}}</ref>

These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm, which depends on the biome's temperature and downfall. See [[biome colors]] for more information.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*When a sugar cane is broken at the second level, the time resets (for example, if a two-block high sugar cane is broken, but is just about to grow to the third stage, it would reset that time).
*By placing more sugar canes on top of a sugar cane plant, it is possible to create tall sugar canes (up to the maximum building height), although they do not naturally grow this high.
*Before sugar cane received an official name, they were sometimes referred to as [[bamboo]], a block added 9 years later. Other names were "reeds" and "papyrus", the former of which being both the original in-game name and internal name.
*Due to its water-displacing properties, sugar cane can interestingly be used to create underwater paths, allowing [[player]]s to move at normal speed and breathe if it is two blocks in height.{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-929||Sugar cane can be placed underwater|WAI}}</ref>
