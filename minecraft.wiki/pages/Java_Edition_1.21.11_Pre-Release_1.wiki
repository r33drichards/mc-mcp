'''1.21.11 Pre-Release 1''' (known as '''1.21.11-pre1''' in the launcher) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.21.11]], released on November 19, 2025.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-21-11-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.21.11 Pre-Release 1|November 19, 2025}}</ref>

A separate [[unobfuscated version]] of 1.21.11 Pre-Release 1 was released, titled '''1.21.11 Pre-Release 1 Unobfuscated''' (or '''1.21.11-pre1_unobfuscated''' when in the launcher). This is an experimental version released in preparation for obfuscation being removed from {{JE}} clients and servers.<ref>{{Mcnet|removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition|Removing obfuscation in Java Edition|October 29, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Data component format]]'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:attack_range}}
** Enables a custom attack range when using the item.
** Overrides the normal entity interaction range for player.
** Regular melee attack range is computed for mobs based on the distance of the target hitbox to their hitbox. This component modifies that distance check by adjusting minimum and maximum padding for the attack hitbox.
** Mobs using {{cd|minecraft:kinetic_weapon}} will have their attack range applied in the same way it applies to players.
** Format: object with fields
*** {{cd|min_reach}}: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid.
**** Default value: {{cd|0.0}}, valid from {{cd|0.0}} to {{cd|64.0}}
*** {{cd|max_reach}}: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the attacker to the target to be considered valid.
**** Default value: {{cd|3.0}}, valid from {{cd|0.0}} to {{cd|64.0}}
*** {{cd|hitbox_margin}}: float, the margin applied to the target bounding box when checking for valid hitbox collision.
**** Default value: {{cd|0.3}}, valid from {{cd|0.0}} to {{cd|1.0}}
*** {{cd|mob_factor}}: float, the multiplier applied to the {{cd|min_range}} and {{cd|max_range}} when checking for valid distance when item is used by a mob.
**** Default value: {{cd|1.0}}, valid from {{cd|0.0}} to {{cd|2.0}}

'''[[Settings]]'''
[[File:1.21.11-pre1 VV Java Tech changelog.png|300px|thumb|An announcement on Rotated Grid Super Sampling.]]
* Added texture filtering in video settings.
** Controls the method used to sample textures when they are viewed at an angle or from a distance.
** Available values are "None", "RGSS", and "Anisotropic".
** The default depends on the selected graphics preset as well as the computer's graphics card capabilities.{{note|AMD GPUs use "RGSS" on the "Fabulous!" preset instead of "Anisotropic" as using "Anisotropic" on AMD GPUs does not perform well.<ref>{{Cite Discord

}}</ref>}}
** "RGSS" (Rotated Grid Super Sampling) is a shader-based filtering method that improves texture clarity at a moderate performance cost.
*** This is available on all hardware.
** "Anisotropic" is a hardware-based filtering method that improves texture clarity even further.
*** The maximum anisotropy may be "2x", "4x", and "8x", controllable by a separate slider.
*** If the graphics card does not support it, anisotropic filtering will do nothing.
*** This significantly impacts [[w:Video random-access memory|VRAM]] usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count).

'''[[Splash]]'''
* Added "Music by [[Hyper Potions]]!"

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Leather horse armor]]'''
* The texture is now the same as in {{BE}}.
* Both the item and the equipment assets have been split into a tinted base layer and an overlay layer.

'''[[Spear]]s'''
* Changed the swap animation scale of all spears from {{cd|1.9}} to {{cd|1.95}}.{{source code ref|Before:<code>"swap_animation_scale": 1.9"</code><br/>After:<code>"swap_animation_scale": 1.95"</code>}}
* The player can now continue to deal damage to the target if they keep charging at it after the initial hit, and mobs can do the same.
* Golden spears are now a [[piglin]]-preferred weapon.
* [[Skeleton variants]] and [[drowned]] no longer pick them up.
* [[Zombified piglin]]s can now charge with the spear and not just jab with it.
* Spears are now placed after [[sword]]s in the [[Creative]] inventory.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Camel Husk]]'''
* No longer sink in water while ridden by a player.

'''[[Nautilus]] and [[zombie nautilus]]'''
* The heads of the Nautilus and Zombie Nautilus now clip less through their shells.
* Baby Nautilus now uses nautilus swimming sounds instead of fish swimming sounds ({{cd|entity.fish.swim}}).
* The [[nautilus shell]] drop is now affected by [[Looting]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancements]]'''
* The "[[Mob Kabob]]" advancement is now a goal advancement instead of a challenge advancement.

=== General ===
'''[[Data component format]]'''
* {{cd|min_reach}}, {{cd|max_reach}} and {{cd|hitbox_margin}} have been moved from {{cd|minecraft:piercing_weapon}} and {{cd|minecraft:kinetic_weapon}} into a new component {{cd|minecraft:attack_range}} to allow all melee weapon types to use them.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|94.0}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|75.0}}.

'''[[Tag (Java Edition)|Tags]]'''
* Entity Type Tags
** Added {{cd|camel_husk}} to {{cd|#can_float_while_ridden}} tag.
* Item Tags
** Added {{cd|golden_spear}} to {{cd|#piglin_preferred_weapons}} tag.

'''[[Textures]]'''
* {{cd|texture}} section of {{cd|*.mcmeta}} files has a new {{cd|alpha_cutoff_bias}} field that controls alpha bias for cutout textures.
** There is no limit for this value technically, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than {{cd|1.0}} or lower than {{cd|-1.0}} since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent.
** Default value for this field is {{cd|0.0}}, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it's too "opaque".
** Only used for lower mips of cutout textures, does not change the alpha of first mip level, and has no effect on other textures.
