[[File:MCB Boosters.png|thumb|250px|The four boosters that can be created in a level]]
'''Boosters''' are stackable power-ups in ''[[Minecraft Blast]]'' that can be obtained through gameplay or through the [[Crafting Masters (Blast)|crafting masters]] rewards system. Some boosters can be activated before a level to start a level with the boosters' corresponding special items while others can be used in-level.

== Obtaining ==
Pre-level boosters can first be unlocked within level 5, where boosters are given for free within playing the level, the boosters will then be placed randomly in the level. Completing level 5 grants players with 3 boosters for each of the three pre-level boosters. In-level boosters are unlocked within level 8 where the first in-level booster which is a pickaxe will be given for free which lets the player try out the booster.

Boosters can be obtained freely with the use of the crafting masters or the "On Fire" event/mechanic in which players are tasked to break a specific amount of yellow blocks which rewards players with a number of boosters or an infinite amount of boosters with a time limit. Boosters can also be created within a level by combining specific numbers of the same colored blocks together.

{{main|On Fire! (Blast)}}
If a level is beaten first try, a pop-up will show up on the next level explaining the "On Fire" mechanic where free boosters will be randomly spawned in for the player at the start of the level. If a level is not beaten within the first try or if the player quits, the "On Fire" mechanic resets.
