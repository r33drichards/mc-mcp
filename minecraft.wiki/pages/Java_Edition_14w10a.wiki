'''14w10a''' is the fourteenth snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on March 6, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307083916/https://mojang.com/2014/03/minecraft-snapshot-14w10a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w10a|date=March 6, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> which adds the <code>showDeathMessages</code> [[game rule]].

== Additions==
=== Command format ===
'''[[Gamerule]]'''
* <code>showDeathMessages</code>
** Toggles whether or not death messages are visible (in chat).

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added "So sweet, like a nice bon bon!"
* Added "Popping tags!"

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* <code>stat.crouchOneCm</code>
** Detects how many centimeters (0.01 blocks) that the player has moved while crouching.
* <code>stat.sprintOneCm</code>
** Detects how many centimeters (0.01 blocks) the player has moved while sprinting.
* <code>stat.timeSinceDeath</code>
** Detects how much time has passed (in [[tick]]s) since the player's last death.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''Block models'''
* Converted more blocks: repeaters, comparators, beds, hoppers, doors, melon/pumpkin stems, cake, and lily pads.
* Changed trapdoor models.
* Rotation can now be done in increments of 22.5 degrees on a single axis.
* Being able to override not just a model, not just a block's model, but an individual block variant's model.
* F3+T and F3+S now reload models.
* The [[missing model]] has changed from [[File:Missing Model JE1.png|32px]] [[File:Missing Model (anisotropic filtering) JE1.png|32px]] to [[File:Missing Model JE2.png|32px]] [[File:Missing Model (anisotropic filtering) JE2.png|32px]], and is now much more widely used as many more blocks have been converted to use models.
*[[Iron bars]] now render their top/bottom texture even when connected to other iron bars from above or below.<ref>{{bug|MC-50349||Iron Bars and glass panes are rendered incorrectly when connected}}</ref>

'''[[Item frame]]s, [[painting]]s'''
* Improved position handling.{{info needed|what does this mean?}}

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Cat]]s'''
* Now display death messages in chat to their owner.

'''[[Skeleton]]s'''
* Flee when being attacked by wolves, instead of fighting back.

'''[[Wolves]]'''
* Now attack skeletons automatically, like how they attack [[sheep]] automatically.
* Now display death messages in chat to their owner.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|clone}}'''
* Minor tweaks to make it more reliable.

'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* Testing for scores now also works in <code>@e</code> entity selector.
* Added scoreboard team property to disable death messages: {{cmd|scoreboard teams option <name> deathMessageVisibility}} with options <code>never</code>, <code>hideForOtherTeams</code>, <code>hideForOwnTeam</code>, <code>always</code>.
* Command {{cmd|scoreboard players}} can now filter by NBT data.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative mode]]'''
* Players in creative mode can now damage entities even if they are flagged invulnerable.

'''Item tooltips'''
* The NBT <code>HideFlags</code> now has a 5th bit (value of 32) that hides potion effects

'''Villager [[trading]]'''
* A new NBT <code>rewardExp</code>, which can be set to true or false, that controls villagers giving xp for trading.

=== General ===
'''[[Twitch]] broadcasting'''
* Now requires a confirmation before starting.

'''UUID'''
* All player lists now are converted to be UUID-based automatically.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* Almost certaintly as a result of the block model conversion, lily pads no longer appear glitched at exactly 8,388,608 blocks out and invisible from 8,388,609 blocks and beyond.
