'''23w43a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.3]], released on October 25, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w43a|October 25, 2023}}</ref> which adds copper and tuff family blocks under experimental features, introduces a new look for bats, adds {{cmd|tick}} command, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|tick}}'''
* A new administrative and debugging command which allows the player to control the ticking flow and measure the performance of the game.
** Requires elevated permissions (admins and above), and so it is not by default available in [[command block]]s and [[data pack]]s.
** Syntaxes:
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick query}}
**** Outputs the current target ticking rate, with information about the tick times performance.
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick rate <rate>}}
**** Sets a custom target ticking rate to the specified value. The value <code>rate</code> must be greater than <code>1.0</code> and lower than <code>10000.0</code>.
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick freeze}}
**** Freezes all gameplay elements, except for [[player]]s and any [[entity]] a player is [[riding]].
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick step <time>}}
**** Only works when the game is frozen. It runs the game for the specified number of ticks and then freezes the game again.This allows to step through the game a set amount of ticks at a time.
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick step stop}}
**** Stops the current stepping process, and re-freezes the game.
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick unfreeze}}
**** Unfreezes the game and resumes all gameplay elements.
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick sprint <time>}}
**** Runs the game while ignoring the set ticking target rate for the specified number of ticks. At the end of the sprint, the game resumes the previous ticking target and display performance information about the tick times while sprinting.
*** {{cmd|link=none|tick sprint stop}}
**** Stops the current {{cmd|link=none|tick sprint}}, and resumes the previous ticking target.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Jigsaw block]]'''
* Added two new input fields in the edit screen.
** Selection priority
*** When the parent piece is being processed for connections, this controls the order in which this jigsaw block attempts to connect to its target piece.
*** Jigsaws are processed in descending priority order and randomly within the same priority.
** Placement priority
*** When this jigsaw block connects to a piece, this is the order in which that piece is processed for connections in the wider structure.
*** Pieces are processed in descending priority order with the default insertion order breaking ties within the same priority.
** This functionality has been added to support the ability for jigsaw structures to generate branches in a depth-first order, as well as give finer control over ordering of connections.
** All existing jigsaw blocks default their selection and placement priority to 0, resulting in the same behavior as before these two configurable values were introduced.

=== Items ===
'''[[Arrow]]s'''
* Special arrows, such as [[spectral arrow]]s, no longer revert to regular arrows when shot and picked up.

'''[[Ender pearl]]'''
* Thrown ender pearls produce a teleportation sound on impact.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bat]]'''
* Their model, animations, and texture have been updated.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>22</code>.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* In NBT format for entity type <code>arrow</code> and <code>spectral_arrow</code>:
** Added {{nbt|compound|item}}.
*** This field is the item that will be picked up.
* In NBT format for entity type <code>trident</code>:
** Renamed {{nbt|compound|Trident}} to {{nbt|compound|item}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>20</code>.
** <code>bat.png</code> has been updated for the new bat model.
** Added block models, items models and block state definitions for the following blocks:
*** {{cd|d=and|chiseled_copper|exposed_chiseled_copper|weathered_chiseled_copper|oxidized_chiseled_copper|copper_grate|exposed_copper_grate|weathered_copper_grate|oxidized_copper_grate|copper_bulb|exposed_copper_bulb|weathered_copper_bulb|oxidized_copper_bulb|copper_door|exposed_copper_door|weathered_copper_door|oxidized_copper_door|copper_trapdoor|exposed_copper_trapdoor|weathered_copper_trapdoor|oxidized_copper_trapdoor|tuff_stairs|tuff_slab|tuff_wall|chiseled_tuff|polished_tuff|polished_tuff_stairs|polished_tuff_slab|polished_tuff_wall|tuff_bricks|tuff_brick_stairs|tuff_brick_slab|tuff_brick_wall|chiseled_tuff_bricks}}.
** Added unique sprites for the following blocks:
*** {{cd|d=and|chiseled_copper|exposed_chiseled_copper|weathered_chiseled_copper|oxidized_chiseled_copper|copper_grate|exposed_copper_grate|weathered_copper_grate|oxidized_copper_grate|copper_bulb|exposed_copper_bulb|weathered_copper_bulb|oxidized_copper_bulb|copper_door|exposed_copper_door|weathered_copper_door|oxidized_copper_door|copper_trapdoor|exposed_copper_trapdoor|weathered_copper_trapdoor|oxidized_copper_trapdoor|chiseled_tuff|polished_tuff|tuff_bricks|chiseled_tuff_bricks}}.

=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''{{Animate|Chiseled Copper JE1 BE1.png;Exposed Chiseled Copper JE1 BE1.png;Weathered Chiseled Copper JE1 BE1.png;Oxidized Chiseled Copper JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Chiseled copper]]'''
* Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Can be crafted both in [[crafting table]] and [[stonecutter]]:
** When in crafting table, consume 2 [[cut copper slab]]s from the same type, resulting in 1 chiseled copper with the same type.
** When in stonecutter, consume 1 [[block of copper]], resulting in 4 chiseled copper from the same type.

'''{{Animate|Copper Bulb JE1 BE1.png;Exposed Copper Bulb JE1 BE1.png;Weathered Copper Bulb JE1 BE1.png;Oxidized Copper Bulb JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Copper bulb]]'''
* A light-emitting block that can toggle its light emission through redstone pulses.
* Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Can be crafted in crafting table with a cross pattern, by 3 blocks of copper from the same type, 1 [[blaze rod]] in the center slot, and 1 [[redstone dust]] in the bottom slot, resulting in 1 copper bulb with the same type.
* They emit less light the more oxidized they are. From less oxidized to most oxidized, they emit block light levels of 15, 12, 8, and 4, respectively.
* While powered by a redstone signal, a redstone crystal in the center of them glows.
* They have following properties:
** Only toggle their light on or off when receiving a redstone pulse. Their state isn't changed if the source of the redstone pulse is removed.
** When the light is on, redstone comparators read a signal strength of 15.
** Don't conduct redstone power.

* Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Works like wooden doors in that they can be opened and closed by the player as well as redstone.
* Can be crafted as other doors, with blocks of copper from the same type (instead of [[copper ingot|ingots]], as in [[iron door]]s).
