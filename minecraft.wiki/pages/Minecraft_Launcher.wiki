The '''''Minecraft Launcher''''' is the main game downloader and launcher for ''[[Minecraft: Java Edition]]'' and one of the game downloaders and launchers for {{BE}}, {{MCD}}, and {{MCL}}. It is available for {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}}, {{w|macOS}} and {{w|Linux}}, but ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition'' and ''Minecraft Legends'' can be played only on Windows 10 & 11, and ''Minecraft Dungeons'' only on Windows 7 or later.

== Features ==
[[File:Launcher login.png|right|thumb|The initial login screen]]
[[File:Minecraft Launcher Animated Loading Screen.webp|thumb|The initial loading screen]]
On the initial login screen, users must log in with a pre-existing Microsoft account, otherwise they can create a new one by clicking the link. Subsequent logins can be done in the "Settings" tab.

On the left side, a "News" tab, a tab for each game, and the ''Minecraft Launcher'' "Settings" tab can be seen.

The top left corner of the ''Minecraft Launcher'' contains the user's Xbox gamertag for the currently active account (which might differ from their ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' username)<ref>https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360052640612</ref>. By clicking on it, users can manage or log out of their active account, and see a "Help" page with various links to helpful resources.

== ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' ==
[[File:Launcher JE tab.png|alt=The default view of the Minecraft: Java Edition on the Minecraft Launcher|thumb|The default view of the ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' on the Minecraft Launcher]]
There are 5 tabs on the [[Java Edition]] page: Play, Installations, Realms, Skins, and Patch notes. 

The main "Play" section allows the user to download (if needed) and launch ''[[Minecraft: Java Edition]]'' with the "Play" button, and also includes an installation selection on the left (which sorts installations by last played), the user's ''Java Edition'' username on the right, and a list of the latest news for the game from [[minecraft.net]] below. 

* One can launch multiple instances of the game by pressing the "Play" button while the game is running. 
* If the device is not connected to the internet, the game can be run in offline mode, but only if the game has been initially downloaded.
* If the user isn't logged into an account that has purchased the game, the "Play" button appears as a "Play demo" button that downloads and launches the [[demo version]] of the game.

There is also a "Patch notes" section where the patch notes of the game's update can be seen, including the snapshots (if enabled).

=== Installations ===
[[File:New Installation.png|thumb|Creating a new installation.]]
{{anchor|Version Control}}
<!--The anchor for the Version Control page. Please move this with the version control information or update that page if this one splits.-->

In the "Installations" section, custom installations can be created and edited. There are buttons to sort and search installations, as well as checkboxes to enable installations with "Releases", "Snapshot", and "Modded" versions of the game. Installations are stored in [[launcher_profiles.json]] (or launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json when using the new Minecraft Launcher for Windows) in the game's directory ([[.minecraft]]).

By default, there are installations for the "Latest release" and for "Latest snapshot" (if enabled), both of which the game versions cannot be changed. A new installation can be created by clicking the "New installation" button and an existing installation can be edited by clicking on it. There is a "Play" button that launches the selected installation and a folder icon that takes to the installation's game directory. The ellipses button contains the options to edit, duplicate, or delete an installation.

On the create/edit installation page, the following can be changed:
* Icon, by selecting one of the default ones or adding a custom one. Custom icons must be a <samp>.png</samp> and 128×128 pixels in size.
* Name, by default called "<unnamed installation>".
* Version, which includes access to older releases and snapshots (if enabled).
* Game directory, the location of where the game files are saved, the default being [[.minecraft]]. The location can be typed in or selected using the "Browse" button.
* Resolution, which changes the game's windows size. It has a list of resolutions, or a custom one can be typed in.
* Java executable, by default uses the bundled java runtime.
* JVM arguments, such as heap size or enabling [[debug renderer]]s not normally accessible in the [[debug screen]] such as mob pathfinding.

Before, it was possible for the users to manually set a [http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html logging configuration] (see [[Minecraft Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg merge/Debugging|Debugging]] for more info), however this doesn't seem to work anymore.<ref>{{bug|MCL-17489||Launcher does not allow to use a custom Log4J configuration|Won't Fix}}</ref>

A specific game version's server jar can also be downloaded by selecting the version in the list and pressing the "Server" button next to it.

=== Backward compatibility ===
[[File:HowtoOldVersion2019.png|thumb|Selecting older versions in the create new installation screen.]]

The ''Minecraft Launcher'' has the ability to play most older releases of the game (and older snapshots, if enabled) by default, but also some older versions prior to [[Java Edition 1.0.0]]. In order to see these versions in the installations section, the player must enable "Show historical versions of ''Java Edition''" in the ''Minecraft Launcher'' settings tab. Because these versions are outdated and unsupported, they may contain bugs and errors that are not present in newer versions. It is recommended to run old versions of the game in a separate directory and backup worlds to avoid save corruption or other problems.<ref>{{cite|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754852-How-to-Change-Game-Version-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition|title=How to Change Game Version for Minecraft: Java Edition|website=Minecraft Help Center}}</ref>

Once historical versions are enabled, the following can be accessed:
* Most [[Java Edition Beta|beta]] versions. 
* Most [[Java Edition Alpha|alpha]] versions.
* One [[infdev]] version.
* Four [[Java Edition Classic|classic]] versions.
* Five [[pre-classic]] versions (However [[rd-20090515]] is a duplicate from [[rd-161348]]).<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|364762596387205120|2 classic versions, an infdev version and a version before minecraft was called minecraft have been added to the launcher!|August 6, 2013}}</ref>
This list of versions is populated by <code>[[version_manifest.json]]</code>.

Some issues with these older versions include:
* Some sounds are wrong; [[bow]]s, [[door]]s, and [[explosion]]s use their sounds from [[RC1]], even in versions released prior to it. In versions before [[Alpha v1.1.2_01]], sounds do not work at all.
* [[Skin]]s and [[cape]]s are missing in versions prior to [[Java Edition 1.7.6|1.7.6]], as earlier versions used a different skin server, which has since been shut down.
* In [[Alpha v1.0.15]] and from [[Alpha v1.2.0]] to [[Alpha v1.2.6]], the ''Minecraft Launcher'' does not set the player's name properly, resulting in everyone using default names: "Player" followed by a random 3-digit number. This makes multiplayer difficult to play, as a player's location and inventory is reset every time they relaunch their client.
:* In [[Alpha v1.2.5]] and Alpha v1.2.6 specifically, players are always named "Player524". Playing multiplayer in these versions is impossible, as joining a server kicks off other players with the same name.
* As a side effect of the above, and as a result of old authentication servers being shut down, online mode no longer works in versions before [[Beta 1.8]].

=== Realms ===
In the "Realms" section, the user can buy, play, and manage a ''[[Realms|Minecraft Realm]]''. Players can choose their Installation of choice before launching a realm.

=== Skins ===
[[File:Minecraft Launcher The skin section *animated*.webp|thumb|The skins section]]
In the "Skins" section, the user can view and change their in-game skin. By default, the skin is either [[Player|Steve, Alex, Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, or Efe.]]

In the Skins library, skin can be applied by clicking "Use". The skin can also be edited, duplicated, chosen to be either wide or slim, or delete by clicking the ellipsis button. By default, the library contains the default Steve, Alex, Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, and Efe skins, which can be duplicated or applied, but not removed. Custom skins can also be uploaded by clicking the "New skin" button.

Visiting this section without purchasing the game displays a button that redirects to the [https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft-java-edition ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' store page].

=== Patch Notes ===
This section shows cards of the patch notes. Each card contains an image on top and the text below stating the name of the patch notes. When clicked, this displays the patch notes.

== ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition'' ==
There are 7 tabs on the [[Bedrock Edition]] page: Play, Realms, Creator Tools, Marketplace, FAQ, Installation and Patch notes.

The main "Play" section allows the user to download or purchase (if needed) and launch ''[[Bedrock Edition|Minecraft: Bedrock Edition]]''<ref name=":0">[https://x.com/MinecraftWikiEN/status/1833601184923361451?t=eVwtKRcXjZlqT9lp96oDSA&s=19 “Minecraft for Windows” has been renamed to “Minecraft: Bedrock Edition” in the Launcher] - [https://x.com/MinecraftWikiEN?t=w_1EMaIo-6Fw9Ud5C4Xzng&s=09 @MinecraftWikiEN] (Minecraft Wiki) on X (formerly Twitter), September 10, 2024</ref> with the "Play" button and also includes an installation selection on the left to choose between the latest release or the latest ''[[Preview]]''. The [[Minecoins]] balance is shown on the right which opens a Minecoins purchase screen when clicked. The latest game news from [[minecraft.net]] and [[Bedrock Edition#System requirements|system requirements]] are shown in a scrollable section below. [[Quick Play]] is accessible and can be managed from the top-right.

* If the device is not connected to the internet, the game can be run in offline mode, but only if the game has been initially downloaded.
* If the user is on an unsupported device, a warning appears with a link to a website with supported devices, the "Play" button got replaced with "Not Playable on this Device".
* If the user isn't logged into an account that has purchased the game, the "Play" button appears as a "Play demo" button that links the player to Microsoft Store to download and launch the [[demo version]] of the game.
The Play section is decorated with key art from the latest named update and allows ''[[Minecraft: Pixel Drift]]'' to be played in place.
[[File:Launcher BE tab.png|alt=The default view of the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on the Minecraft Launcher|thumb|width=283x283|The default view of the ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition'' on the Minecraft Launcher]]

[[File:Marketplace Pass Section.png|thumb|width=288x288|The Marketplace Pass section]]
In the "Marketplace Pass" section, the user can subscribe to the [[Marketplace Pass]] and access to the 150+ Marketplace content that changes every month.

== Command line usage ==
{{msgbox|title=Important Note|text=On Windows, this works only on the old Unified Minecraft Launcher and NOT the Microsoft Store version.|type=issue|mini=1}}
{{missing information|section|the default host of the proxy (if available) and the --nativeLauncherVersion flag}}
The ''Minecraft Launcher'' can be invoked using the command line by typing {{cd|%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Minecraft Launcher\MinecraftLauncher.exe}} in Windows, {{cd|minecraft-launcher}} in Linux or {{cd|/Applications/Minecraft.app/Contents/MacOS/launcher}} in Mac.[[File:Minecraft Launcher Command Line Args.png|thumb|The Help Message when using MinecraftLauncher.exe --help]]
As of version [[Launcher 2.2.25xx|2.2.25xx]], the ''Minecraft Launcher'' has these command-line options available for ''Minecraft: Java Edition'':
* {{cd|--demo}} - This launches the demo version of the game, much like if the game hasn't been purchased yet.
* {{cd|-h, --help}} - This option displays a help message on how to run it in the command line.
* {{cd|--clean}} – This option deletes the "<samp>game</samp>" and "<samp>runtime</samp>" folders, including their contents, from the working directory.
* {{cd|--launcherui}} - This option presents the login screen.
* {{cd|-w, --workDir}} – This option, followed by a path (relative or absolute), changes the location (and/or name) of the <samp>.minecraft</samp> folder.
** Can be used to create a portable installation of the game. For example, {{cd|--workDir}} (or {{cd|--workDir<nowiki>=</nowiki>.}}) can be used to make the ''Minecraft Launcher'' use the current directory (no matter what the current folder is called).
* {{cd|--nativeLauncherVersion}} - .
* {{cd|--tmpDir}} – This option, followed by a path (relative or absolute), changes the location (and/or name) of the <samp>tmp</samp> folder.
* {{cd|-l, --lockDir}} - This option, followed by a path, restricts the installation directory to a specified folder.
* {{cd|--winTen}} – This option adds support for Windows 10. Since the ''Minecraft Launcher'' now supports Windows 10 fully, this option is unnecessary and seems to have no effect.
* {{cd|--proxyHost}} - This option changes where the host of the proxy is.
* {{cd|--proxyPort}} - This option changes the default port from {{cd|80}} to a custom one.
* {{cd|--disableGPU}} - This disables GPU acceleration in the ''Minecraft Launcher'', which might fix issues when playing ''Minecraft''..
* {{cd|--debugGPU}} - This opens up a new window showing debug information, like "Graphic Feature Stats", which shows if Hardware acceleration is enabled on certain features, and an option to copy the content to the clipboard. These might be useful for troubleshooting purposes.

== Uninstalling the old ''Minecraft Unified Launcher'' ==
Source: [https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/4412266387213 "Uninstalling the Old Minecraft Unified Launcher"] – Minecraft Help Center.

This applies only to players using Windows 10 or newer. Older versions of Windows are not able to use the new ''Minecraft Launcher for Windows''. With the addition of a new launcher, you can uninstall the old launcher to remove any confusion between the two. For clarity, the new launcher is referred to as the "''Minecraft Launcher for Windows''" and the old launcher as the "''Minecraft Unified Launcher''". 

How to uninstall the ''Minecraft Unified Launcher'' (old launcher):

# Click the start menu in Windows (windows icon in the bottom left).
# Type in "Add or remove programs" and click the top entry.
# Search for "''Minecraft Launcher''". The launcher to uninstall displays '''Mojang''' underneath the title "''Minecraft Launcher''".
# Click the three dots shown to the left of the "''Minecraft Launcher''" title and select "Uninstall".

Now only one launcher should be installed. Run the ''Minecraft Launcher for Windows'' to ensure it still works; if it doesn't, reinstall using Microsoft Store.

Launcher or game mods may need to be migrated or re-installed to the new ''Minecraft Launcher for Windows'' installation location before uninstalling the old launcher. Check with the mod developer for more detail.

== History ==
{{Hatnote|The Launcher is a separate piece of software from ''Minecraft''. For its versions history, see [[Launcher version history]].}}

=== Java applets ===
'''Java applets''' were the original way to run ''Minecraft''. It worked using a {{W|Web browser|web browser}}, and was used by some players to play the game<ref>https://jvm-gaming.org/t/browser-applet-games/36314/2</ref>, even after the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' was introduced.
* This software had a size of around 4.5 MB, excluding additional assets.
* The applet version relied on the Java plugin, which was later considered insecure and then discontinued.<ref>https://www.fortinet.com/blog/industry-trends/java-browser-plugin-is-dead-long-live-html5</ref>
* The applet was often used to violate the ''Minecraft'' [https://www.minecraft.net/eula EULA].

{{issue list|projects=mcl}}

== Trivia ==
*In version 2.2.2529 release notes there's text that reads: T⍑ᒷ ᔑ ̇/𝙹ꖎ𝙹ℸ ̣ ꖎᓭ ᔑ∷ᒷ リ𝙹ℸ ̣ ∴⍑ᔑℸ ̣ ℸ ̣ ⍑ᒷ|| ᓭᒷᒷᒲ - which translates to "THE AXOLOTLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM".
*Both Alpha and Classic versions of ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' are listed as "old_alpha", despite them not being the same.<ref>{{bug|MCL-9589||Versions of Classic, Infdev, etc. are still labeled as being part of the Alpha development phase|Won't Fix}}</ref>
*The ''Minecraft Launcher'' doesn't store passwords locally. Instead, it uses a 'refresh token'.
*The current ''Minecraft Launcher'' is the eighth launcher for ''Minecraft: Java Edition'', and the third that was built to automatically update itself.
*Game crashes are reported to Mojang Studios through [[Hopper (crash utility)|Hopper]].
*The legacy ''Minecraft Launcher'' can be downloaded {{dl|eabbff5ff8e21250e33670924a0c5e38f47c840b|custom|name=launcher.jar|title=here}} (version 1.6.93, ~4.6MB as opposed to the modern launcher's ~85MB). However, the legacy ''Minecraft Launcher'' is incompatible with Microsoft accounts and was discontinued in Q2 2021 due to account migration.
*In version 2.3.240, the pig on the ''Minecraft Launcher'' screen was given a crown in light of popular ''Minecraft'' YouTuber [[Technoblade]] passing away due to [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351048 cancer].
*The Armadillo loading screen animation is scaled to 1280×720 (16:9) but was originally 646×364 (&approx;16:9.02), causing distortion to the animation.
