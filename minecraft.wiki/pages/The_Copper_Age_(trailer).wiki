'''The Copper Age''' is an official trailer for [[The Copper Age]], revolving around [[Sunny]] discovering the many uses and quirks of [[copper golems]].

== Summary ==
On a dark and stormy night, [[Sunny]] begins work on a [[copper golem]], cautiously placing a [[Jack o'Lantern|pumpkin]] on a [[block of copper]] Sure enough, a golem appears, eager to work, and tempts Sunny to place items into its [[Copper Chest|chest]]. Some time passes, Sunny bringing in a [[lantern]], [[copper bulb]], and [[copper ingot]] for the golem, but a [[zombie]] appears. Terrified, Sunny runs away, which confuses the golem.

Later, Sunny emerges in the base exhausted from an apparent fight, covered in several [[arrows]]. They place a [[golden apple]] onto a [[shelf]], and empty out precious goods into the chest nearby. Later again, Sunny enacts an experiment with [[TNT]], and the copper golem accidentally walks right into it, setting fire to the base. After that problem is presumably resolved, Sunny tends to a [[brewing stand]], and realizes the copper golem is oxidizing. Distraught that it's become a [[Copper Golem Statue|statue]], Sunny brings it outside to be put to rest at a memorial, but realizes it can be brought back to life using a [[copper axe]]. The copper golem springs to life once again, and the two hug, ending the story.
