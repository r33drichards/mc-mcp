'''18w19a''' is the thirty-third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on May 8, 2018,<ref name="18w19a">{{snap|18w19a|May 8, 2018}}</ref> which added the [[Dolphin's Grace]] effect and changed some IDs, mainly to biomes.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Effect]]s'''
* [[File:Dolphin's Grace JE1.png|32px]] [[Dolphin's Grace]].
** Acquired by swimming near [[dolphin]]s.
** Makes the player swim faster.

=== Fluids ===
'''[[Logic]]'''
* Separated some of the logic for blocks and fluids.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|987293762069155841|Trying to extract parts of BlockState into StateHolder<T> and turn BlockStateDefinition into StateDefinition<T> so I can use the same system for liquids|April 20, 2018}}</ref>
** Current fluids:
*** <code>minecraft:empty</code>
*** <code>minecraft:flowing_water</code>
*** <code>minecraft:water</code>
*** <code>minecraft:flowing_lava</code>
*** <code>minecraft:lava</code>
** The fluid at a location is currently dependent on the block at the location; currently there still are water and lava blocks. <!-- i.e. this change hasn't happened yet: https://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/988712909315493888 -->
* Added two new fluid [[tag]]s: <code>minecraft:lava</code> and <code>minecraft:water</code>.
* This system is mostly internal; it cannot be directly interacted with yet.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Buffet]] worlds'''
* New generation type: "Caves".
** Creates [[Nether]]-like generation.
