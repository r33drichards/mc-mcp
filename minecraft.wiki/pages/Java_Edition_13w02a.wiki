* Due to major texture storage changes in this snapshot, certain unused or invalid blocks (like [[locked chest]]s) no longer have a texture to use and will [[crash]] the game if rendered into view.
* Mining an empty jukebox creates an invisible "Air" item. Interacting with the item will crash the game and likely delete the chunk the jukebox was in.<ref>{{bug|MC-2711||resolution=fixed}}</ref>

'''13w02a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on January 10, 2013.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130112233704/http://www.mojang.com/2013/01/minecraft-snapshot-13w02a/</ref>

An experimental version of 13w02a was released by [[Dinnerbone]] on [[Mojira]] to try to fix an issue with white textures.<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-6764?focusedCommentId=35251#comment-35251 MC-6764 (comment 35251)] – Nathan Adams on Mojira, January 11, 2013.</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Activator Rail JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Activator rail]]s'''
* Used to trigger [[minecarts with TNT]].
* Need to be powered by [[redstone]].
* Transmit power up to 8 activator rails far.
* Crafted the same way as normal [[rail]]s except without a stick in the middle.

'''[[File:Block of Quartz JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Block of quartz]]'''
* New building block.
* Made by using 4 pieces of [[nether quartz]] in a square.

'''[[File:Chiseled Quartz Block (UD) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Chiseled quartz block]]'''
* New building block.
* Crafting recipe is 2 [[quartz slab]]s vertically.

'''[[File:Quartz Pillar (UD) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Pillar quartz block]]'''
* New building block.
* Crafting recipe is 2 blocks of quartz vertically.

'''[[File:Quartz Stairs (N) JE1.png|32px]] [[Quartz stairs]]'''
* New stair block. 
* Crafting recipe is the same except that it is made out of any quartz block.

'''[[File:Quartz Slab JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Quartz slab]]s'''
* New slab block.
* Crafting recipe is the same except that it is made out of any quartz block.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart with TNT]]'''
* Triggered by [[activator rail]]s.
* Crafting recipe is a [[TNT]] block on top of a [[minecart]] (allowing for creation in the 2&times;2 inventory).
* When it derails, it explodes instantly, ignoring the usual timer delay.
* Explodes even more violently the faster it goes.
* In Creative mode, when left clicked while moving, the minecart with TNT explodes.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Now includes the cause of death, the player the deceased player was fighting at time of death, and the name of the item used to kill.
* For death messages for fall damage, a complicated system was introduced.
** There are now two types of messages, "[player] <first>" and "[player] <first> and <last>".
*** <first> can be:
**** fell [off a ladder/off some vines/out of the water/fell from a high place]
**** was [shot/pummeled/blown/fireballed/knocked] [off a ladder/off some vines/out of the water/from a high place]
**** was [shot/pummeled/blown/fireballed/knocked] [off a ladder/off some vines/out of the water/from a high place] by [player/mob]
*** <last> can be:
**** into a pool of lava
**** fell out of the world
**** into a patch of fire
**** into a patch of cacti
**** got finished off by [player/mob]
**** got finished off by [player/mob] using [item]
**** got finished off using [item]
** There are 352 different death messages for falling. (Technically there are 416 because the verb "blown" exists twice in the en_US.lang file.)

== Changes ==
{{info needed section|ID changes for empty minecarts and minecart with furnace/chest}}
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Anvil]]s'''
* Improved naming of containers.
** Renamed chests, trapped chests, dispensers, furnaces, brewing stands, and enchantment tables display the new name in their GUI where the normal name used to appear.

'''[[Hopper]]s'''
* Is now controllable by [[redstone]] – players can power it to disable item forwarding.
* Added a proper icon.
* Is no longer considered wooden (cannot be used as a fuel in a furnace, etc.).
* New crafting recipe uses [[iron ingot]]s rather than [[stone]].
* The redstone signal emitted when a [[redstone comparator]] is placed against it directly has changed.
** 1 item gives a signal strength of 1, a 1/3 of a stack (21 for items which stack to 64) gives a signal strength of 2.
** The number of full stacks x 3 = signal strength.
** E.g. 2 stacks of an item/block give a signal strength of 6, while 2 potions also give a signal strength of 6 (because a potion occupies one stack).

'''[[Lava]] '''
* Changed textures.
* Now flows more quickly in [[the Nether]].
* Enclosed hidden lava [[spring]]s now generate in the Nether.

'''[[Redstone comparator]]'''
* Updated texture.
* When fed by containers, they now start giving out a signal as soon as 1 item is in the container, allowing for empty container detection.

'''[[Slab]]s'''
* The final [[seamless Stone Slab|"seamless" stone slab]] (and, by extension, [[smooth stone]]) has been removed as a result of the addition of quartz slabs.

'''[[Trapped chest]]s'''
* Now in "Decoration Blocks" tab in [[Creative inventory]].

=== Mobs ===
'''General '''
* Improved naming of [[spawn egg]]s.
** Mobs spawned from renamed eggs have the name of the egg and the names appear in the [[Server#Death messages|death message]].
** Mobs can now display their custom name as nametag using [[NBT]] data. 

'''[[Skeleton]]s'''
* Improved aiming.
* Now shoots from 15 blocks away, instead of 10.
* Accuracy changes with [[difficulty]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Changed the chests to [[minecarts with chests]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Language]]'''
* Updated language files.
** Language files can now be updated via the background downloader (no need for a new Minecraft release).

'''[[Missing textures and models]]'''
* Changed the missing texture from {{pximg|Missing Texture JE1.png|64px}} to {{pximg|Missing Texture JE2.png|64px}}.
* Is now present in the [[texture atlas]]es <samp>[[stitched_terrain.png]]</samp> and <samp>[[stitched_items.png]]</samp>.

'''[[Texture pack]]s'''
* Textures now use one file per block/item, which are stitched together at runtime – texture sizes don't need to be consistent.
* Any block and item can be animated by putting the frames underneath each other in the right .png – player can use an optional .txt to specify frame order and duration.
* Textures for animated blocks or items (water, lava, fire, nether portal, compass and clock) are no longer procedurally generated, and now have their own texture files.
* Existing texture packs are "automagically" converted.
* Vanilla textures are used if texture files are missing.
