'''Baron Sweetcheeks''' is a pet hamster raised by [[Ms. Minerva]] and her class, appearing as a secondary character in [[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles|''Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles'']]. Throughout the series and its followups, he provides a source of near-comic relief. He is eventually joined by fellow pets [[Duchess Dimples]] and [[Prince Pellets]].

== Appearance ==
Sweetcheeks is an ordinary, if slightly stylized hamster. He has a round, potato or eggplant shaped body, with beady eyes and tiny limbs. In certain artwork, he is depicted with yellowish brown fur.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-Into-Game-Woodsword-Chronicles/dp/1405293802/132-9941804-9392251?psc=1|title=Minecraft: Into the Game (Minecraft Woodsword Chronicles #1)|website=Amazon}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780008510848-minecraft-woodsword-chronicles-volume-1|title=Minecraft Woodsword Chronicles Volume 1|website=Libro.fm}}</ref>

== Personality ==
Based off all available evidence, Baron Sweetcheeks acts identical to a normal hamster. He is known to eat a special hamster cookie at least once per day. During his introduction he is shown to be very curious and adventurous, but is described as frightened outside, implying either cowardice or a break of repetition. 

== Biography ==

=== Woodsword Middle School ===
{{Expand section|Complete tenure}}
At an unknown time, Sweetcheeks was adopted to be raised by the children of [[Woodsword Middle School]], with [[Morgan Mercado]] having several experiences with him. On her first day, [[Ash Kapoor]] was introduced to the hamster. Morgan explained what he knew about the hamster, leading to Ms. Minerva suggesting he take time off from raising him so Ash can get to know the responsibility, which she accepts. Several weeks later, she ends up taking him home for the night. Somehow, he manages to escape his cage and runs loose into the house, Ash frantically searching for him. When Morgan arrives he helps her figure out he must be in the backyard, which proves to be correct, Baron terrified going down a slide. 

On a later day, [[Doc Culpepper]] discovered a swarm of [[Bats (Woodsword Chronicles)|bats]] living inside of a ventilation shaft. Just as she tried to warn Minerva and her class, they broke free and began to overwhelm the classroom, everyone trying to evacuate. In the chaos, Sweetcheeks is almost left behind, Ash saving him at the last second. After everyone regroups, Sweetcheeks is kept inside of the computer lab for safety until the situation can be resolved. By Saturday the bats are successfully relocated to a personalized home, and thus Baron is allowed to return to the classroom.

Although he was now free from trouble, Doc appeared to take a liking to Sweetcheeks, and requested to borrow him at a later point while working on an [[Project Coral Restoration|aquarium project]].

== Trivia ==

* Following the release of Into the Game!, the name Baron Sweetcheeks was mentioned in multiple articles on [[Minecraft.net]]. However, these were in reference to [[hoglins]], not the character. It's unclear if there is an intended connection.<ref name="meethoglin">{{mcnet|meet-hoglin|Meet the Hoglin|Oct 19, 2019|Tom Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|announcing----minecon-live|Announcing...

* According to an interview with [[Nick Eliopulos]], the name Baron Sweetcheeks came to him on the spot while pressed for time, trying to think of something absurd.<ref>{{Mcnet|new-books--woodsword-chronicles|New Books: Woodsword Chronicles|May 15, 2019|Tom Stone}}</ref>
* Baron Sweetcheeks’ food comes in a container with his own face on it.
