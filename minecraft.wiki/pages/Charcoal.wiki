'''Charcoal''' is an [[item]] obtained by smelting [[log]]s or [[wood]]. It is used as [[Smelting|fuel]], or for crafting [[torch]]es and [[campfire]]s. Unlike [[coal]], charcoal cannot be traded with [[villager]]s or crafted into a [[block of coal]]. Coal and charcoal also cannot stack together. It can be used as a substitute for coal, as both charcoal and coal have an equivalent duration when smelted.

== Obtaining == 
=== Mining ===
A [[campfire]] broken without the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment drops 2 charcoal.

=== Smelting ===

=== Fuel ===
When used in a [[furnace]] as a fuel, a piece of charcoal lasts 80 seconds (smelting up to 8 items), the same as coal. Charcoal used as fuel lasts more than 5 times longer than [[wood planks]] or [[wood]] logs used as fuel, being more efficient than any other use of wood for smelting {{in|Java}}, but outstripped by [[wooden slab]]s {{in|Bedrock}}. 

Coal and charcoal are also the only fuels accepted by [[furnace minecart]]s. They provide three minutes of transit each.
