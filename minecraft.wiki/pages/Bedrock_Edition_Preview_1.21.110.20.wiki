'''Beta 1.21.110.20''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.110.20''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the first beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.111]],{{note|1.21.110 is not a version of the game and its betas are instead part of 1.21.111.|name=1.21.111}} released on July 22, 2025,<ref>{{mcnet|minecraft-preview-1-21-110-20|Minecraft Preview 1.21.110.20|July 22, 2025|Jay Wells}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/38234446024333-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-110-20|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.110.20|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=July 22, 2025}}</ref> which adds [[shelf|shelves]] and [[copper golem statue]]s, changes [[dye]] textures, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Copper Golem Statue.png; Exposed Copper Golem Statue.png; Weathered Copper Golem Statue.png; Oxidized Copper Golem Statue.png|20px}} [[Copper Golem Statue]]'''
* Copper golem statue is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants.
* Copper golem statue oxidizes over time and can be waxed like copper blocks.
* The pose of the block can be changed by interacting with it.
* If the copper golem statue has no oxidation when interacted with using an axe, the block will turn into a copper golem again.
* When connected to a redstone comparator, the copper golem statue block emits a redstone signal based on its current pose.

'''{{animate|Spruce Shelf.png; Oak Shelf.png; Birch Shelf.png; Dark Oak Shelf.png; Pale Oak Shelf.png; Mangrove Shelf.png; Cherry Shelf.png; Crimson Shelf.png; Warped Shelf.png; Bamboo Shelf.png|32px}} [[Shelf]]'''
* The shelf is a new type of decorative block which comes in all wood variants.
* The shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any stripped log, stripped stem, or block of stripped bamboo, filling the top and bottom row.
** This recipe produces 6 shelves.
{{Crafting
|A1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|B1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|C1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|A3 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|B3 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|C3 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|Output = Matching Shelf, 6
|type = Decoration block
|ignoreusage=1
}}
* The shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
** Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot.
** The shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an item frame.
* While a shelf is powered by redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered shelves will connect.
** Interacting with a single powered shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar.
** Interacting with two connected shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar.
** Interacting with three connected shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar.
** It does not matter which of the connected shelves the player interacts with.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Fire]]'''
* Some blocks that could catch fire with flint and steel, like the top stone slab or wood stair, will now also catch fire during fire explosion, such as those from fireballs.
* Glass blocks will now catch fire with flint and steel or fire explosion.

=== Items ===
'''[[Copper armor]] and [[Copper tools|tools]]'''
* Hostile monsters now have a chance to spawn with copper armor equipped.
* Hostile monsters can pick up and use copper weapons and armor.

'''{{Animate|Black Dye BE2.png;Blue Dye BE2.png;Brown Dye BE2.png;Cyan Dye BE3.png;Gray Dye BE3.png;Green Dye BE4.png;Light Blue Dye BE3.png;Light Gray BE3.png;Lime Dye BE3.png;Magenta Dye BE3.png;Orange Dye BE3.png;Pink Dye BE3.png;Purple Dye BE3.png;Red Dye BE4.png;White Dye BE2.png;Yellow Dye BE3.png|32px}} [[Dye]]s'''
* Dye colors now have updated icons.
* The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Wolves no longer start shaking off water if they are already shaking off water.

'''[[Copper Golem]]'''
* If the copper golem has fully oxidized it will turn into a copper golem statue block.
* When turned into a copper golem statue block, it will freeze in a random pose.
* When turned into a copper golem statue the copper golem will drop any item it may be holding.
* A copper golem turned into a copper golem statue will keep its name if named with a name tag.

=== General ===
'''[[Experiments]]'''
* Removed the "Drop 3 2025" experimental toggle.

'''Graphical'''
* Update volumetric fog configs for PC to have more consistent steps in performance impact, while also maximizing image quality for cost.
* Added support for subsurface scattering on particle textures.
* Updated max render distance to 28 on PC for Vibrant Visuals.
* Increased thickness on block selection wireframe to make it more visible in Vibrant Visuals especially with TAAU enabled.

'''[[Realms]]'''
[[File:New UI - Edit World Realms Screen Menu (Bedrock Preview 1.21.110.20).png|thumb|The new "Edit World" screen in ''Minecraft Realms''.]]
* New [[Edit World]] page available to try:
** To access, click "Settings" on the Realms tab to go to the Slots page. Then, select a world and click "Edit World." There will be a button at the top of the page that you can click to try the new design.
** You can flip back and forth between the old and new designs as much as you want.
** Resource and behavior packs will still have to be configured in the old design for now.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Add-On]]s and Script Engine'''
* Moved the properties {{cd|ash}}, {{cd|red_spores}}, {{cd|blue_spores}}, and {{cd|white_ash}} from the {{cd|minecraft:climate}} biome component to the new client biome component {{cd|minecraft:precipitation}}.

'''[[API]]'''
:{{cd|@minecraft/server}}
* Added {{cd|@minecraft/server}} version {{cd|2.3.0-beta}}.
* Added {{cd|@minecraft/server}} version {{cd|2.2.0}}.
* Enabled {{cd|Player.applyImpulse}} and {{cd|Player.clearVelocity}}.
* class {{cd|AimAssistRegistry}}
** Added readonly property {{cd|DefaultCategoryId}}.
* Updated {{cd|System.sendScriptEvent}} to be able to be called in "before" events.

'''[[Biome]]s'''
* Added content errors in server side biome components that were missing them to more easily identify issues and how to fix them.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* Custom block geometry no longer produces a warning when fully contained within the first or last 1/16ths of the unit cube volume in any axis.
** A warning is still produced if the geometry doesn't have at least one corner overlapping the unit cube volume, not counting its boundary.

'''Components'''
* Content warnings will log missing references in {{cd|Jigsaw Structure}}, {{cd|Processor List}}, {{cd|Template Pool}}, and {{cd|Structure Sets}} JSON.
* Content warnings will log missing references in {{cd|Camera Preset}}, {{cd|Camera List}}, {{cd|Aim Assist Preset}}, and {{cd|Aim Assist Categories}} JSON.
* Content warnings will log missing item references in {{cd|Crafting Items Catalog}} JSON.
* Changes to {{cd|minecraft:input_air_controlled}}.
** Renamed to {{cd|minecraft:free_camera_controlled}}.
** Removed upward movement behavior when holding the jump action from this component.
* Added new component {{cd|minecraft:vertical_movement_action}}.
** Adds the functionality of upward or downward movement when holding the jump action.
** This component is automatically added to any entity that uses the old {{cd|minecraft:input_air_controlled}} with format version 1.21.100 or older.
* Updates to {{cd|minecraft:dash}}.
** Renamed to {{cd|minecraft:dash_action}} to improve clarity.

'''Entity Components'''
* Added {{cd|slot.weapon.mainhand}} and {{cd|slot.weapon.offhand}} as valid slots for {{cd|minecraft:interact}} component operations.

'''Entity Event Responses'''
* Added the {{cd|drop_item}} entity event response, which allows an entity to drop its item in a given slot.

'''Graphical'''
* Changed defaults for color grading contrast and saturation fields to 1. Previously the defaults were 1.2 and 1.05 respectively.

'''[[Item]]s'''
* Setting the {{cd|minecraft:use_modifiers}} component's {{cd|movement_modifier}} field to 1.0 now allows using the item while sprinting, and starting to sprint while using the item.
* {{cd|poly_mesh}} is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature.
* {{cd|texture_meshes}} is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature.
* The {{cd|scale}} field can now adjust the depth of {{cd|texture_meshes}}, since its value is no longer ignored.
* Added the {{cd|use_pixel_depth}} option to {{cd|texture_meshes}} to control how geometry depth relates to texture resolution.
** If set to {{cd|true}}, the geometry will have a depth of one pixel (in entity space, not texture space).
*** This causes textures with a resolution different from 16×16 to appear stretched.
** If set to {{cd|false}}, the geometry will be built from perfectly cubic voxels, regardless of the texture's aspect ratio.
** Defaults to {{cd|true}} to ensure backward compatibility.

== Experimental ==
