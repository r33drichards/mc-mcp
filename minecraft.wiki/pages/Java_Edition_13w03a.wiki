'''13w03a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on January 17, 2013<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130119145655/http://www.mojang.com/2013/01/minecraft-snapshot-13w03a/</ref> which adds [[dropper]]s, [[minecarts with hoppers]], and the {{cmd|testfor}} command.

13w03a was reuploaded twice. The first time was later on January 17, 2013, to fix an issue with [[dropper]]s duplicating [[item]]s,<ref name="DropperInfo"/> and it was soon reuploaded for a second time half an hour later fixing the inability to break [[block]]s by punching, and random crashes when breaking blocks and items.<ref name="-3">{{tweet|Dinnerbone|291950737754296320|If you experienced crashing with breaking blocks, re-re-download the snapshot. Sorry...|17 Jan 13}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Dropper (E) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Dropper]]s'''
* Places items in containers in front of them.
** If there is no container it will eject the item without using it.
** A [[dispenser]] "shoots" items at the [[player]], while a dropper "throws" items at them.<ref name="DropperInfo">{{tweet|Dinnerbone|291942193969639425|Sneaky ninja re-upload of 13w03a to fix an item corrupting issue with the Dropper. Redownload the snapshot!|17 Jan 13}}</ref>
* Crafted using [[cobblestone]], a [[hopper]], and a piece of [[redstone]]:

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[File:Minecart with Hopper JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Minecart with hopper]]'''
* Crafting recipe is a [[hopper]] on top of a [[minecart]].
* Can only be emptied by passing over a hopper.
* Can pick up items it passes over.

=== Command format ===
'''<code>/testfor</code>'''
* Command to test for players. 
* Uses comparators to get an analog redstone signal indicating the amount of found players.

=== General ===
'''[[Minecraft Realms]]'''
* Strings related to Realms have been added to the localization files.
* At this point, it is named ''Minecraft Online''.
* It is not accessible, and it is currently unknown if any proper code related to Realms exists in this version.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Pillar quartz block]]s '''
* Can now be placed in any orientation – placement works like with wooden logs.

'''[[Command block]]s'''
* [[Comparator]]s fed by command blocks will now indicate whether the last run command was run successfully.

'''[[Detector rail]]s'''
* Comparators powered by them now give out a signal depending on the fullness of the container on the rail.

'''[[Locked chest]]s '''
* Now have their crash fixed causing their texture to be changed again.

'''[[Water]]'''
* It is now possible to form a source block above another source block. This prevents players from ruining oceans or rivers with [[bucket]]s.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Skeleton]]s'''
* Now shoot faster when their target is closer.
* They shoot players even from one block away.

'''[[Zombie]]s'''
* Now call other zombies to attack in a group (radius scales with difficulty).
* Deal more damage if low on health (also scales with difficulty).
* When on fire, they can set players on fire.
* Now become aggressive and come towards the [[player]] when shot from further away.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart with TNT]]'''
* When blown up using activator rails, they no longer destroy rails and supporting blocks.
* Still blows up redstone materials.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added some new chat options in multiplayer menu: 
** ''Focused Height'' 
** ''Unfocused Height'' 
** ''Width'' 
* Moved the texture packs button (no longer appears on the main menu). 
** Players can now change texture packs in-game.
