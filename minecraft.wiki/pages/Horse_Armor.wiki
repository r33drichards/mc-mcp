=== Crafting ===

Only leather and netherite horse armor can be created; other horse armor can be obtained only from chest loot from structures listed above.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources|leather horse armor}}

== Usage ==
=== Equipping ===
Horse armor can be equipped to a horse either by manually placing it in its respective slot ({{SlotSprite|Horse Armor}}) in the horse’s inventory, or by pressing [[control|Use]] on the horse while holding it. The horse armor can be removed either by manually removing it from the armor slot or by using [[shears]] on the horse. Only regular adult (and [[zombie horse|zombie]]) [[horse]]s can wear horse armor; baby horses, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, and [[skeleton horse]]s cannot be equipped with armor. Leather horse armor protects horses from freezing in [[powder snow]], but it does not negate other powder snow effects (e.g., falling through, inability to jump). In case of zombie horses, horse armor also prevents the mob from burning in [[sunlight]]. If a horse dies while equipped with any horse armor, it will drop it along with any other loot upon death.

=== Damage reduction ===
Horse armor reduces incoming damage according to two values: <abbr title="armor points">armor</abbr>, and armor toughness.

The strength of incoming damage also determines the damage reduction of horse armor, as horse armor does not protect in a linear fashion, and instead drops off more and more as incoming damage increases. The total damage reduction of horse armor cannot drop off below 20% of its maximum.

The following tables represent the damage reduction of the different horse armor types depending on the incoming damage, accounting for armor toughness:

=== Durability ===
Unlike player armor or wolf armor, horse armor does not have [[durability]]. This means a single horse armor can be used infinitely unless it is destroyed through other means.

=== Enchanting ===
Unlike [[armor|player armor]], horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, {{in|java}} Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an [[anvil]] to enchant with [[Thorns]], [[Feather Falling]], [[Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Blast Protection]], [[Curse of Binding]], and [[Curse of Vanishing]]. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.

=== Dyeing ===
{{main|Dyeing#Dyeing armor}}

Leather horse armor can be dyed by combining it with [[dye]](s) through crafting{{only|je|short=1}} or by {{control|using}} it on a [[cauldron]] containing dyed water.{{only|be|short=1}} {{control|Using}} leather horse armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s are attracted to golden horse armor and run toward any golden horse armor on the ground, inspecting it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.

=== Armor stands ===
Horse armor cannot be placed or displayed on [[armor stand]]s as it would be on a horse.

== Trivia ==

*The seats on certain armors are colored to resmble a related element to the material of the armor.
**The seat on copper horse armor resembles the color of [[Oxidation|oxidized copper]].
**The seat on netherite horse armor resembles the color of [[lava]], which netherite horse armor is immune to.
