'''Cobblestone''' is a common [[block]] obtained from mining [[stone]]. It is mainly used for [[crafting]] or as a building block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break cobblestone is [[pickaxe]]. Cobblestone needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Cobblestone|Pickaxe|Wood}}
Cobblestone drops itself when it's destroyed.
=== Natural generation ===
Cobblestone occurs naturally in [[monster room]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, [[pillager outpost]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[stronghold]]s, [[plains]], [[taiga]], [[snowy plains]], [[desert]], and [[savanna]] [[village]]s, [[woodland mansion]]s, [[trail ruins]] and in [[trial chambers]] surrounding baby zombies spawners alongside [[mossy cobblestone]].

A single block of cobblestone always generates at the coordinates of (8, -61, 8) at the center of the [[void start platform]], in [[Superflat]] worlds created with [[the Void]] biome preset.

=== Post-generation ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Cobblestone farming}}
When [[water]] and flowing [[lava]] come into contact, the flowing lava is replaced by cobblestone. However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, [[stone]] is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into [[obsidian]] upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.

=== Block drops ===
Cobblestone is dropped by [[stone]] when broken without [[Silk Touch]], and also by [[infested cobblestone]] when broken with Silk Touch.

== Usage ==
Cobblestone can be used as a basic building block, as it has relatively high blast resistance and is common.

=== Silverfish ===
[[Silverfish]] can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an [[infested block]].
