A '''calibrated sculk sensor''' is a [[craftable]] type of [[sculk sensor]] that functions similarly, but detects [[vibration]]s more quickly and from further away. Its [[amethyst]]-covered input side can be [[redstone|powered]] to make the sensor only detect vibrations from specific sources, depending on the signal strength used. Placing an [[Block of Amethyst|amethyst block]] next to a sculk sensor allows it to "relay" detected vibrations to other sculk sensors.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A calibrated sculk sensor can be broken with any tool, but [[hoe]]s are the quickest. It drops itself only if mined with any tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. If mined with a non-Silk Touch tool, it drops 5 [[experience]] instead.

== Usage ==
When a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it is activated and emits redstone signal in every direction (including top and bottom), except the side with the amethyst stripe. The redstone signal emitted from the bottom will [[Redstone mechanics#Powered blocks|strongly power]] the block below the sensor, whereas in all other directions (excluding the side with the amethyst stripe) it is as though the sensor itself is the strongly powered block. 
[[File:CalibratedSculkSensorPower.png|thumb|An activated calibrated sculk sensor. Only the block ''below'' the sensor is strongly powered. All other sides react as if the sensor itself is strongly powered, excluding the side with the amethyst stripe. ]]

The calibrated sculk sensor is different from the basic [[sculk sensor]] in multiple ways:
* can detect vibrations within a [[distance]] of 16 blocks, instead of 8.
* is activated for 10 game ticks after detecting a vibration instead of 30 game ticks
* can be filtered (see below) to react only to some sounds.
* one side does not emit a redstone signal when activated (the side with the amethyst stripe).

When a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, it is activated for 10 game ticks, then has a 10 game tick cooldown before it can detect another vibration. This means that a calibrated sculk sensor can detect a vibration once every 1.05 seconds, as opposed to once every 2.05 seconds for a regular sculk sensor. (Plus 0.05 for every block of distance from the vibration past the first.)

=== Filtering ===
When a [[Redstone mechanics#Signal strength|redstone signal]] powers a calibrated sculk sensor on its crystalized side, the sensor is filtered to respond only to vibrations that match the strength of that signal. Every vibration in the game has a frequency associated with it, and every vibration frequency directly matches a specific redstone signal strength. For example, a vibration with a frequency of 5 matches the redstone signal with a strength of 5.

Some events can create multiple vibrations simultaneously. For example, eating most food items creates vibrations of frequency 3 (item interaction) and 8 (entity eats). Hitting the ground and taking fall damage creates vibrations of frequency 2 (hit ground) and 7 (entity damage). Using a redstone signal, the sensor can be filtered to detect either frequency. If no redstone signal is provided, the sensor detects the highest frequency.

==== Vibration frequency ====
{{main|Vibration}}
{{:Vibration}}

=== Piston interactivity ===
Calibrated sculk sensors cannot be moved by [[piston]]s or [[sticky pistons]].

=== Vibration resonance ===
When a calibrated sculk sensor detects a vibration, any adjacent [[block of amethyst]] re-emits a vibration of the same frequency that the calibrated sculk sensor detected, which can be detected by [[sculk sensor|sculk sensors]] and other calibrated sculk sensors.
If the calibrated sculk sensor is filtered, the block of amethyst re-emits only the vibrations matching the filtered redstone signal strength.

== Sounds ==
A calibrated sculk sensor is silent if [[Waterlogging|waterlog]]ged. It can still detect vibration, but does not produce sounds itself.
