== Bugs ==
'''3 bugs reported'''
* Due to the addition of tools to mine certain block types faster, there is now a bug where switching an item while mining causes the game to cycle through the entire terrain.png file and overlay its textures on the mined block. (Starts from the cracked animation textures).<ref>{{ytl|zxmTuDcCxdk|Minecraft Indev Glitch|Alyx Bailey|January 10, 2010}}</ref>
** It is unknown when this bug was fixed.
* Sand and gravel no longer falls when placed above ground, it needs a block update first.{{verify|Could be in-106}}
* This version had a bug which caused the player to drop 2 items at once when the Q key or left clicking the mouse was pressed. Going back to pick up the items would only give back 1 though. Due to this bug if the player has 2 of a block, then drops the block, it creates an infinite item glitch allowing the player to continue dropping items and be left with 1 item in the inventory each time. Picking up the dropped items would now affect the item count nor stop the glitch.
** It is unknown when this bug was added or removed.<!--This bug does not appear in in-104 and in-124-2310, so it might be between this verion-->
