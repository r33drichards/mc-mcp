This guide is a simplified overview of '''all non-experimental changes''' in the [[Bats and Pots]] drop ({{BE}} 1.20.50 to ''Bedrock Edition'' 1.20.73), which assumes at least some familiarity with [[Trails & Tales]] (''Bedrock Edition'' 1.20.0 to 1.20.41), excluding experimental features in these versions.

== Mobs ==
=== Changed ===
{|{{Simple Guide table|Changed Mobs}}
|-
| General
|
|
* Mobs on fire no longer spread [[fire]] to their target when holding something in their main hand.
* Changed mob attack reach calculation.
** In horizontal directions, mobs' attack reach are now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions, instead of using horizontal width to determine.
*** For example, a ravager won't be able to attack through a few block thick walls.
** In vertical directions, mobs' attack reach are now the exact vertical range of their bounding box. When there's no overlap between their bounding box and their target's bounding box in vertical direction, they can not attack, in specific:
*** Riding a medium-sized mob (e.g. horse) can get rid of attacks from short mobs (e.g. baby zombie).
*** Riding a tall mob (e.g. camel) can get rid of attacks from standard size mobs (e.g. zombie).
*** Some mob's reaching height now extended (e.g. enderman, safety height changed from 1.5 to 3).

| [[Wolf]]

|
* Wolves can now withstand the same amount of damage as {{in|JE}}.
** Rather than halving all damage dealt to tamed wolves by entities other than [[player]]s or [[arrow]]s.
* Increased the maximum health of tamed wolves from {{hp|20}} to {{hp|40}}. Pre-existing tamed wolves need to be fed to reach the new maximum health.
** To ensure the healing rate remains consistent, the health restored by feeding wolves has been doubled.
