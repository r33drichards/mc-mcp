'''20w46a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on November 11, 2020,<ref>{{snap|20w46a|November 11, 2020}}</ref> which adds [[powder snow]] among other changes.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Powder Snow JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Powder snow]]'''
* [[Entities]] that walk over it sink into it.
* Can be picked up and placed with a [[bucket]].
* [[Leather boots]] can be worn to prevent entities from sinking into powder snow blocks.<!--Tested, works with anything that can have armor items, including mobs that normally don't wear armor, like cows.-->
** [[Player]]s can still [[crouch]] to descend with leather boots. Wearing leather boots also allows powder snow to be "climbed", like [[water]] or [[scaffolding]].
* Entities in powder snow slowly freeze.
** Once frozen, [[damage]] is slowly dealt to the entity.
** Wearing leather [[armor]] is intended to slow the freeze effect, and a full set of leather armor is intended to stop the freeze effect. However, this feature was not implemented properly.<ref>{{bug|MC-205041}}</ref>

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Powder Snow Bucket JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Powder snow bucket]]'''
* Using a [[bucket]] on [[powder snow]] creates a powder snow bucket.
* Powder snow buckets can be used to place powder snow.
* Powder snow buckets can also be filled from [[cauldron]]s filled with powder snow.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|item}}'''
* Modifies the [[inventory]] of a [[block]] or [[entity]].
** This command has three forms:
*** <code>/item <target> replace <item stack> [<count>]</code> – same as old <code>/replaceitem</code>.
*** <code>/item <target> modify <modifier></code> – modifies item (without copying). 
*** <code>/item <target> copy <nowiki><source></nowiki> [<modifier>]</code> – copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier.
** Possible sources and targets: <code>entity <selector> <slot></code> or <code>block <x> <y> <z> <slot></code>.
** For example, <code>/item block ~ ~ ~ container.0 copy entity @s enderchest.0</code> copies first item from player's ender chest to first slot of container player is currently standing on.

'''[[Item modifier]]s'''
* Reuse functions syntax of a [[loot table]] to describe item modification in {{cmd|item}} command.
* The function part of loot tables can now be defined as separate [[data pack]] resource in <code>item_modifiers</code> directory.
** Such files can contain a single function (i.e single [[JSON]] object) or an array of functions.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Rolls, set_damage, and possibly other parameters now require "type:uniform" (or other valid values for "type") when using min-max for numbers. set_count has had the same requirement for a few versions.
* New condition: <code>value_check</code>
** Checks range of value.
** Parameters: 
*** {{nbt|int}}{{nbt|compound|value}} – see "New value providers" section (currently combination of random generators and score).
*** {{nbt|int|range}} – min/max range.
* New function: <code>set_enchantments</code>
** Modifies enchantments on item.
** Parameters:
*** {{nbt|compound|enchantments}} – map of enchantment id to level value (can be score or random number)
*** {{nbt|boolean|add}} – if <code>true</code>, change is relative to current level. If <code>false</code>, level is replaced with current value (default behavior).
* New value providers: <code>score</code>
** Returns scaled scoreboard value.
** Parameters:
*** <code>score</code> – scoreboard name.
*** <code>target</code> – same as <code>target</code> in <code>score</code> predicate.
*** <code>scale</code> – scaling factor (float).

=== General ===
'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added a new particle type: <code>snowflake</code>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added new <code>snow_step_sound_blocks</code> block tag.
** Contains [[snow]] and [[powder snow]].
** Blocks in this tag create snow stepping noises while the [[player]] walks '''in''' them.
* Added new <code>powder_snow_walkable_mobs</code> entity tag.
** Contains [[rabbit]]s, [[endermite]]s, and [[silverfish]].
** [[Entities]] in this tag can walk on top of powder snow.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Amethyst bud]]'''
* Can now be obtained using a Silk Touch pickaxe.

'''[[Banner]]s'''
* The unused "base" pattern has been renamed to the "field" pattern and given proper translation strings (its ID is still "base").

'''[[Cauldron]]s'''

* Using a [[bucket]] on a cauldron filled with powder snow empties the cauldron and creates a [[powder snow bucket]].
* Can also be filled with powder snow by {{ctrl|using}} a powder snow bucket on it.

'''[[Copper block]]'''
* Crafting recipe has been changed to require only 4 [[copper ingot]]s.
* Putting a copper block in a [[crafting table]] also results in 4 copper ingots.
