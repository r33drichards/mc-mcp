=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie|Zombies]], [[Husk|husks]], [[Skeleton|skeletons]], [[Stray|strays]], [[bogged]], [[Piglin|piglins]], and [[Zombified Piglin|zombified piglins]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[Ominous Trial Spawner|ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[Vindicator|vindicators]] and [[Pillager|pillagers]] spawning in [[Raid|raids]] have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop iron leggings. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and have a 50% chance of being [[enchanted]] with a random [[enchantment]].

== Usage ==
Leggings can be placed in the 3rd armor slot of a player's [[inventory]] for activation.

=== Statistics ===
Each armor point reduces damage by 4% (increasing additively). Armor points are signified by half a shirt on the armor bar above the health bar. The effectiveness of armor points is decreased as the strength of incoming attacks increase, an effect lessened by armor toughness. Armor toughness does not have a visual indicator bar. Leggings durability is decreased by 1 for every {{hp|4}} of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Different leggings types have different enchantability from one another, a value that affects the strength of enchantments received directly though [[enchanting table]]s. Netherite leggings provide a knockback resistance of 1 (10%).

==== Unit repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing with Anvils|Leggings|Pants}}
Leggings can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding units of the [[tiers]]' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. Two leggings of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the leggings' [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
Leggings can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a pair of leggings, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
