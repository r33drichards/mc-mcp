A '''creeper''' is a common [[hostile mob]] that quietly approaches a [[player]], hisses, and if not retreated from in time, will [[explode]]. Creeper explosions can destroy [[block]]s and deal massive amounts of [[damage]], which can be completely blocked using a [[shield]].

When struck by [[lightning]], a creeper becomes a '''charged creeper''', which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob [[head]]s to be obtained from [[piglin]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s and other creepers it kills.

Due to its distinctive appearance and unique destructive method of attack, the creeper has become one of the most iconic mobs of ''[[Minecraft]]'', being featured in promotional material and merchandise.

== Spawning ==
Creepers naturally spawn in the [[Overworld]] on [[solid block]]s with a [[light level]] of 0, except in [[mushroom fields]] and [[deep dark]] biomes. {{IN|Bedrock}}, creepers also do not spawn in [[river]]s, [[frozen river]]s, and [[snowy plains]]. They spawn individually {{in|bedrock}} and in groups of four {{in|java}}.

{{IN|bedrock}}, there is a [[Mob_spawning#Bedrock_Edition_mob_cap|density limit]] of five creepers on the surface of Overworld.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Creeper Chase.png|thumb|left|A creeper giving chase.]]

Creepers chase any [[player]] within a 16-block radius. They chase the player at a 14-block radius when they are crouching. They do not attack any other mob without provocation by being attacked first.

When within 3 blocks of a player, a creeper stops moving, hisses, flashes and expands, and [[explode]]s after 1.5 seconds (30 [[tick]]s), destroying (and dropping as [[item]]s) blocks in the area as well as significantly damaging the player. A creeper's detonation can be halted if the player leaves the blast radius, including by knocking it back, going out of the creeper's sight, or if the creeper is killed before the explosion. Assuming the player stays within line of sight, the distance that the player must move in order for a creeper to cancel its explosion is 7 blocks, regardless of difficulty. Normal creeper explosions have a power of 3.

{{IN|java}}, if the [[game rule]] <code>mobExplosionDropDecay</code> is set to false, blocks have a 100% chance of dropping as items instead of being destroyed.

A creeper explodes only if it has an uninterrupted line of sight with the player throughout the entire 1.5-second countdown. As a result, if the creeper does not have line-of-sight with the player, it does not start hissing even at close range, even if the player is attacking it, and a detonation is canceled if it has started. The hissing sound plays in its entirety regardless of whether the explosion happens or not.

Unlike most mobs, the creeper does not have an idle sound, nor does it have unique step sounds. Although it does make normal stepping and swimming sounds, it is hard for players to distinguish those from sounds they make themselves. This makes the approach of a creeper difficult for an unwary player to notice until it starts hissing. 

A creeper jumps down to a player if it can survive the fall. A creeper taking fall damage adds to its swell according to <code>fallDistance * 1.5</code>, up to a maximum of 5 less than the fuse of the creeper. The creeper explodes when the swell equals the fuse, so an explosion occurs soon after landing with higher falls. For example, a creeper falling from greater than 16 blocks can explode 5 ticks after it lands. 

[[File:Falling Creeper Swell Values.png|thumb|right|The amount of swell added to creepers upon falling a certain distance.]]

Creepers can climb up [[ladder]]s, [[vines]], and similar blocks like any other mob, but do not do so intentionally. 

{{control|Using}} a [[flint and steel]] or [[fire charge]]{{only|java|short=1}} on a creeper forces an explosion.

{{IN|java}}, the detection range of creepers is reduced by 50% when the player is wearing a [[creeper head]].

Creepers flee from [[ocelot]]s and [[cat]]s within a 6-block radius, with faster movement than when pursuing a player. Cats and ocelots do not attack creepers. A creeper that has begun a detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. <!--A cat or ocelot is defined as "nearby" if the following formula is true: {{cd|d^2 + d2^2 + d3^2 < 49}}, where {{cd|d}} is the difference in X coordinates, {{cd|d2}} is the difference in Y coordinates, and {{cd|d3}} is the difference in Z coordinates. This means a cat or ocelot is "nearby" if it is just under 7 blocks away in ''only'' one direction, or is just above 4 blocks away in every direction.-->

Creepers are not targeted by tamed [[wolves]], [[iron golem]]s or [[zoglin]]s. However, they are still attacked by [[wither]]s, [[snow golem]]s,<ref>{{bug|MC-73964||Snow golems can attack creepers}}</ref> [[vindicator]]s named "Johnny", [[warden]]s and [[goat]]s. When hit by a stray projectile (like a [[drowned]]'s trident), a creeper retaliates if not already chasing a player, unless said projectile is a skeleton's arrow, in which case the creeper will always retaliate. If a creeper is attacked by any mob except a [[goat]], the creeper moves toward the mob that attacked it and explodes.

When a creeper is inflicted with a [[status effect]], its explosion creates an [[area effect cloud]] of the effect.{{only|java}}

=== Charged creeper ===
[[File:Charged Creeper.png|128px|right]]
[[File:Charged and normal creeper explosion comparison.png|thumb|Two creepers' explosion damage radius in the dirt. Comparison between a charged creeper's (left) and a normal creeper's (right). Notice that the charged creeper's explosion is much bigger than the normal creeper's explosion.]]
Charged creepers are stronger versions of creepers. They are distinguished from normal creepers by their blue aura surrounding them, and their explosion power is significantly increased.

A charged creeper is created when [[lightning]] strikes within four blocks of a normal creeper. The lightning can be created in any way, including naturally, with the {{cmd|summon}} command, by a [[trident]] with the [[Channeling]] enchantment, or attracted to a [[lightning rod]]. Due to this mechanic, creepers cannot be damaged by lightning but still can take damage from fire caused by it.

A charged creeper can also be [[Commands/summon|summoned]] using the following commands:
* {{IN|Java}}: <code>/summon creeper ~ ~ ~ {powered:1}</code>
* {{IN|BE}}: <code>/summon creeper ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:become_charged</code>

Their countdown timers are the same as normal creepers, both in terms of range and time. With a power of 6, an explosion caused by a charged creeper is twice as powerful as the explosion caused by a creeper. Charged creepers' explosions are 50% more powerful than an explosion of [[TNT]]. How close the creeper was to the lightning strike does not affect the size or power of the explosion.
	
{{IN|Java}}, a charged creeper explosion that kills [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, [[piglin]]s, or other creepers causes one<ref>{{bug|MC-63534||Only one mob skull can be dropped if a Charged Creeper kills several mobs of the same type.|WAI}}</ref> of those mobs to drop its corresponding [[mob head]]. If multiple valid mobs are killed in the explosion, the one that drops a head is chosen at random. {{IN|bedrock}}, a charged creeper explosion that kills zombies, skeletons, wither skeletons, piglins, or other creepers causes all the killed mobs to drop their corresponding heads.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-18599||Multiple Mob Head Drops from Charged Creeper}}</ref>

A charged creeper does not drop its own head when it explodes, although any other charged creepers or creepers killed in the explosion drop a creeper head. Players and [[ender dragon]]s do not drop their heads,<ref>{{bug|MC-132933||Inconsistency: Player, Ender Dragon, and Wither don't drop their heads when killed by charged creeper|WAI}}</ref> nor do mobs without corresponding mob heads, such as livestock animals.

Charged creepers have the same entity ID as normal creepers. The only difference is that the value of the boolean <code>powered</code> [[Chunk format#Mobs|tag]] is set to <code>1</code> (true).

The overlay of charged creepers is strongly emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]], and darkens the environment as a screen effect. Combined with the darkness of a thunderstorm, this makes the creeper behind it almost invisible.

These mobs were originally meant to be a [[pig]], but due to a coding bug, it created a creeper after the model got repurposed.

{{quote|The story of the Creeper &ndash; it was supposed to be the pig, but Notch mixed the height and the width values, or the rotation of it, so it's standing up instead of lain horizontally. But it did have the AI behaviour of looking at the player. So he just thought it was extremely creepy, with this weird thing walking around, looking at you. So he decided to keep it as a monster. He wrote that a friend said it would be cool if it exploded *laughs* and that brought us to the Creeper.

The face was to clearly, with a limited number of pixels, make it look really dangerous. I think the green colour is supposed to be camouflage. But we're still debating &ndash; is it flesh? Or is it more like leaves? Or is it fur? You don't really know just by looking at the pixels. I know [[Junkboy]] debates that! *laughs*

* [[Notch]] has stated on X that he imagined "creepers as being made out of leaves or similar" and that he is "not sure why they explode".<ref>{{tweet|notch|27860129973|@jeremybenthamm I imagine them as being made out of leaves or similar.

* Creepers are bright green color to camouflage them for the original classic ''Minecraft'' foliage textures, which were bright shades of green, but has since been changed.
* In multiplayer, if a creeper is attacked by another player, and the other player runs out of sight, it does not attack any other players.
* When asked how creepers trigger their explosive nature, [[Dinnerbone]] said "They're so nervous that they shake a lot, and then this sets them off the same way as how rubbing two sticks makes fire".<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|408694324927676416|@Graphoniac They're so nervous that they shake a lot, and then this sets them off the same way as how rubbing two sticks makes fire.|December 5, 2013|archive=|archiveid=}}</ref>
* If a charged creeper is given [[Invisibility]], the "aura" effect is still visible.
* A charged creeper explosion can inflict the greatest amount of damage any mob in the game can do at one time.
* The creeper hiss sound uses the same sound file as when a block of TNT is primed but played at a lower pitch.
* Creeper was the first hostile mob added in the [[survival test]].
* Throughout many pieces of media, whenever a creeper's anatomy is shown it's consistently shown they possess a skeleton and a TNT block inside.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://minecraftshop.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/minecraft-creeper-skeleton-vintage-cap|title=Minecraft Creeper Skeleton Vintage Cap|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mattel-Minecraft-TNT-Series-25-Mini-Figure-CREEPER-SKELETON-1-inch-Loose/5411867525|title=Mattel - Minecraft TNT Series 25 Mini Figure - CREEPER SKELETON (1 inch)(Loose)|website=Walmart}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Minecraft-Creeper-Anatomy-Vinyl/45463225|title=Minecraft Creeper Anatomy Vinyl|website=Walmart}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|3Gf48aMIbpA|Minecraft Creeper Anatomy from Spin Master|TTPM Toy Reviews|July 23, 2014}}</ref>

* [[Jeb]] has admitted that the creeper would probably not be added to Minecraft if the game's modern design principles were followed, since it would be controversial to have a mob that destroys the player's builds. However, it continues to exist in the game due to its iconic status.<ref>{{YouTube link|aBTJIYzJDJw|The Biome that Broke Minecraft|Minecraft|October 12, 2025|t=339s}}</ref> [[Notch]] agreed, stating that the creeper only explodes as the result of player (in-)action because random destructive events you have no control over is anti-fun.<ref> {{tweet|notch|1982139362017214465|I've been seeing a lot of Jeb hate over him saying the creeper's only around because it's iconic, and I'd like to set something straight.<br><br>This is originally one of MY opinions.<br><br>I tried to fix the creeper by having it only explode as the result of player (in-)action, as I realized random destructive events you have no control over is anti-fun.|October 25, 2025|archive=|archiveid=}}<br>{{tweet|SkiBall3148|1982139814452384018|This may also be because they're gearing towards changing every texture in Minecraft for some unknown reason, and many people have pointed out that they would change the creeper's texture if they could.

=== Publicity ===
[[File:Creeper Danger.png|thumb|right|A sight that can scare even the most experienced ''Minecraft'' players.]]Creepers have a formidable reputation in the community because of their potential to hurt or kill even veteran players and destroy structures. Their distinct appearance and destructive abilities have made them a widely recognizable ''Minecraft'' icon. Creepers are referenced in several of the items available at the ''Minecraft'' merchandise depot,<ref>[https://www.minecraftshop.com/ Official Minecraft Store]</ref> and have become an internet meme complete with fan art, webcomic references, and demotivational posters. A central part of the meme is the creeper's unofficial catchphrase derived from the mob's tendency to sneak up on the player and hiss before detonating:

{{q|''That'sssss a very nice <random valuable object> you've got there... It'd be a ssssshame if anything were to happen to it...''|image=CreeperFace.png|Creepers<ref>{{citation|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/minecraft-creeper| title = Minecraft Creeper|website=Know Your Meme}}</ref>}}

==== Merchandise ====
Creepers have been portrayed in many ''Minecraft'' products including but not limited to:

* The letter "A" in the ''Minecraft'' [[logo]] after [[Java Edition Beta 1.4]] (The previous logo was just "MINECRAFT" written with cobblestone blocks)
* Stuffed toys
* [[Action figures]]
* Bracelets
* T-shirts
** The creeper anatomy T-shirt reveals the insides of a creeper, and also reveals its scientific name: ''Creepus explodus''.
* [[LEGO Minecraft]]
* Papercraft
* ''Minecraft'' Facebook profile image
* In the goodie bags given out at Minecon 2011, creepers were given as a fold-able and tapable decoration for one's room or collection, along with [[diamond]] and [[grass block]].
