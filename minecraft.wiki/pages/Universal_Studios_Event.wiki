The '''Universal Event''' was an [[Event servers|event server]] made in collaboration with ''{{w|Universal Pictures}}''. There are six districts in the map, which are designed as a theme park. Players could complete two sets of quests to obtain two character creator items. The map contained 6 minigames and 3 parkour courses.

== Tickets ==
'''Tickets''' were a currency obtained by completing parkour, playing minigames, finding golden clappers, and completing achievements. They were used to purchase items from various shops around the server.

== Shot List ==
The shot list was a list of achievements which could be completed by each player on the server.

== Districts ==
[[File:UniversalQuickTravel.png|The in-game [[map]] used for quick travel, showing all six districts of the event.|right|frameless]]
The server was divided into 6 main districts: the entrance at the bottom of the map, Courthouse Square in the center, and Jaws Lake, Shrek's Swamp, Wall Street, and Western Street around it. Each district has a distinct theme as well as unique shops, parkour, and minigames. The quick travel menu could be used to view a map of the server as well as teleport to each area.

=== Entrance ===
The entrance was the location at which players spawn. In the center was a replica of the rotating Universal globe fountain found at Universal Studios in real life. Behind the spawn point was the theme park's exit, blocked by a gate. To the left was the entrance to Wall Street, to the right was the entrance to Western Street, and directly forward was Courthouse Square on the other side of a road.

Players in the 7x7 area around the spawn point were given Invisibility for 99,999 seconds. Players who moved out of this area had the effect removed.

== Trivia== 
* This is not only the first collaborative event server (the closest previous being a promotion for ''[[Minecraft Legends]]''), but the first to be released to celebrate a holiday as opposed to a specific ''Minecraft'' release.
* In one of the promotional images, a character resembling [[Zuri]] can be seen in the background, the only difference being noticeably different hair.
* The Wall Street and Western Street cutouts appear to reuse spritework from the [[Trails & Tales Event]]; in particular, [[Efe]] and a [[camel]].
* Notably, the map correctly names the shark from ''Jaws'' as Bruce instead of attributing the title to him, as is common.
