'''Charred baked potato bricks''' are a smelted version of [[baked potato bricks]] in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{breaking row|Charred Baked Potato Bricks|Hoe|Wood|horizontal=1|hidecopper=1}}

Charred baked potato bricks take a very long time to mine due to their extremely high hardness. Even using a [[golden hoe]] with [[Efficiency V]] and a [[Haste]] II effect, mining them still takes almost 30 seconds. However, unlike other blocks with high hardness (e.g. trial spawners, reinforced deepslate), charred baked potato bricks drop as an item when mined.
