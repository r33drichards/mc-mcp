== Mechanics ==
[[File:ParrotsOnShoulders.gif|thumb|300px|Two tamed [[parrot]]s on the player's shoulders]]
Each animal can be tamed via different mechanics. [[Wolves]] can be tamed by giving the animal [[bone]]s. [[Cat]]s and [[parrot]]s can be tamed by giving the animal its favorite [[food]]. Once tamed, these animals follow the player unless told to sit. Tamed wolves fight alongside their master. Tamed wolves and cats can be bred, and they stop hunting animals by themselves. Tamed parrots can ride on the player's shoulder and mimic nearby mob sounds.

[[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[llama]]s, [[trader llama]]s, and [[zombie horse]]s can be tamed by repeatedly mounting the animal until it stops bucking the player off. Feeding them [[#Special items|their favorite foods]] makes taming them easier. Once tamed, these animals can be bred and given equipment. Tamed horses, donkeys and mules can be controlled while riding, but only if equipped with a [[saddle]].

{{IN|Bedrock}}, skeleton horses do not need a saddle to be controlled while riding, while {{in|Java}}, [[skeleton horse]]s are tamed by default after the horse trap is triggered.

Upon the death of a pet wolf, cat, parrot, nautilus, or zombie nautilus the message is broadcast to the pet's owner {{in|java}} or to all players in the server {{in|bedrock}}. {{IN|Bedrock}}, death messages are also produced upon the death of a pet horse, zombie horse, donkey, mule, llama, or trader llama.

==== Trusting ====
Some mobs can never be tamed per se, but the player can still gain their trust. Trusting mobs stop fleeing from players, and they do not despawn.
[[File:Tamed Fox With Egg in Mouth.png|thumb|110px|A trusting fox holding an egg in its mouth]]

A [[fox]]'s trust actually can't be gained if the animal spawned naturally, but they can still be bred by the player. Baby foxes bred this way trust players. A trusting fox defends the player against a number of mobs.

An [[ocelot]]'s trust can be gained by feeding it [[raw cod]] or [[Raw Salmon|salmon]].

== Special items ==
These are the foods and other items that are helpful in taming animals or otherwise gaining their trust. No items are usable for taming skeleton horses.
