== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
''' [[Copper door]] and [[copper trapdoor]] '''
* Are now crafted from copper ingots instead of copper blocks.
** Due to this, oxidized variants of copper doors and copper trapdoors can no longer be crafted.

''' [[Ominous trial spawner]] '''
* Spawners with mobs that are unable to wear equipment now spawn double the total mob count over the course of the challenge.
** These spawners also spawn an additional mob out at once during its challenge.
* [[Bottle o' enchanting]] is no longer a possible projectile for ominous trial spawners.

''' [[Ominous vault]]s '''
* Increased the chance of obtaining [[mace]] enchantments.

''' [[Trial spawner]] '''
* Rotten flesh has been removed as a possible item to eject.

=== Items ===
''' [[Axe]] and [[shield]] '''
* When a player with an axe in the main-hand and a shield in the off-hand performs a {{ctrl|use}} action, the game now prioritizes holding up the shield over {{ctrl|using}} the axe (to strip wood or scrape copper).

''' [[Mace]] '''
* The mace smash attack no longer creates dirt particles when hitting a target whose center is in the air nor knocks back the player's own pets.
* Doubled the mace's durability from 250 to 500.
* [[Density]] is no longer as powerful and the mace now does less damage when falling from great heights.
** See the {{Slink||New mace damage formula}} below.
** Reduced the mace's base damage to {{hp|5}}. This means the player does {{hp|6}} damage when {{control|attacking}} with it.
** Reduced the damage per block per level of Density from {{hp|1}} to {{hp|0.5}} (a quarter heart).
** Increased the mace smash attack's damage for shorter falls, and decreased the damage for longer falls:
*** The first 3 blocks fallen increase the damage by {{hp|4}} per block.
*** The next 5 blocks fallen increase the damage by {{hp|2}} per block.
*** Each block fallen after that increases the damage by {{hp|1}}.
* Attack speed has been drastically reduced from 1.6 to 0.5, the lowest attack speed in the game.
* [[Density]], [[Breach]], [[Smite]], and [[Bane of Arthropods]] are now all incompatible with each other. Each mace can only have 1 of these [[enchantment]]s.
* [[Fire Aspect]] can no longer be applied to maces.

''' [[Wind charge]] '''
* They now use a new damage type <code>wind_charge</code> instead of <code>mob_projectile</code>.

==== New mace damage formula ====
<math>f \left( h \right) = \begin{cases}
6 + \left(4 + 0.5 \cdot D \right) \cdot h, & \text{if } 0 \leq h \leq 3 \\
12 + \left(2 + 0.5 \cdot D \right) \cdot h, & \text{if } 3 < h \leq 8 \\
20 + \left(1 + 0.5 \cdot D \right) \cdot h, & \text{if } 8 < h \\
\end{cases}</math>

<math>f \left( h \right)</math> is the damage done by the mace when falling from a height of <math>h</math> blocks

Here is a graph of what that formula means:

[[File:Desmos-graph (2).png|480px]]

=== World generation ===
''' [[Trial chambers]] '''
* Spider spawners have been moved to the "melee" category.
* Slime spawners have been moved to the "small melee" category.
* Made various layout changes in intersections and corridors.
* Added new trap dispenser style to chambers.
* Fixed various broken jigsaw connections in the corridors.
* Made seams match in corridors.
* Added new entrance variations.
* Fixed various broken or incorrect jigsaw data.
* Added empty chests to chamber entrances.

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[Advancement]]s '''

* [[Infested]], [[Oozing]], [[Raid Omen]], [[Trial Omen]], [[Weaving]], and [[Wind Charged]] are now required for the "How Did We Get Here" advancement.<ref>{{bug|MC-269958||New effects are not required for the "How Did We Get Here?" advancement|Fixed}} </ref>
* Flow and bolt armor trims now grant the "Crafting a New Look" advancement.<ref>{{bug|MC-269881||Flow and bolt armor trims don't grant "Crafting a New Look" advancement.|Fixed}} </ref>

''' [[Knockback (mechanic)|Knockback]] '''
* Projectile knockback is no longer dependent on the shooters position.
** Projectiles such as [[arrow]]s and [[fireball]]s knock back in the direction they travel.
** Projectiles such as [[splash potion]]s and [[firework]]s knock back away from themselves.
** Projectiles shot by a [[dispenser]] also knock back.

=== General ===
''' [[Crash]] '''
* The unit of memory sizes in crash reports is changed from "MB" to "MiB", while the way to compute the sizes is not changed.
* Crash reports now includes the total sizes and available sizes of JNA temporary directory, netty native libraries' directory, LWJGL temporary directory and system temporary directory.

''' [[Data pack]] '''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>42</code>.
* Added new music disc items and loot table entries for the music discs.
* Painting variants are now data-driven.
* The item argument in the {{cmd|give}}, {{cmd|item}}, and {{cmd|loot}} commands now supports removal of default components with ! prefix.
** e.g. {{cmd|give @s diamond_pickaxe[!tool]}} gives a diamond pickaxe without the tool component.
* Enchantments are now data-driven.
* Enchantments that show up in the game are now controlled by enchantment providers.
* Enchantment exclusivity is now controlled through tags.

''' Enchantments '''
* Weapons enchanted with [[Fire Aspect]] can now be used to light [[candle]]s and [[campfire]]s, to match {{BE}}.
* Enchantments are now set through data. An enchantment is a set of core properties like level ranges and cost together with some effects. Most effect types also support a set of conditions, making it possible to apply them only when certain criteria are met.
* Enchantments can be added in the registry enchantment. All vanilla enchantments can be found in the vanilla data pack in the client and server jar files.
* Fields:
** <code>description</code>: the name of the enchantment when displayed in text represented as a text component.
** <code>exclusive_set</code>: the enchantment(s) this enchantment is exclusive with.
*** Two enchantments can never co-exist on an item if either is in the other's exclusive set.
*** Specified as an enchantment ID, a list of enchantment IDs or an enchantment tag prefixed with <code>#</code>.
*** Optional - if omitted, the exclusive set is empty.
** <code>supported_items</code>: the item types that can have this enchantment.

*** All enchantments range from level 1 to their maximum level.
*** Positive integer.
** <code>min_cost</code>, <code>max_cost</code>: describe the range of costs for this enchantment in the [[enchanting table]] (and how much it returns when disenchanted).
*** Both min and max cost are described using a linear formula:
*** <code>base</code>: base cost at level 1.
*** <code>per_level_above_first</code>: added for each level over 1.
** <code>anvil_cost</code>: fee taken for the enchantment in the [[anvil]].
*** Non-negative integer.
*** This value is halved when an enchantment is added to a book.
*** The effective fee is multiplied by the level of the enchantment.
** <code>slots</code>: a list of slot groups this enchantment works in.
*** Each entry is one of <code>any</code>, <code>hand</code>, <code>mainhand</code>, <code>offhand</code>, <code>armor</code>, <code>feet</code>, <code>legs</code>, <code>chest</code>, <code>head</code> and <code>body</code>.
** <code>effects</code>: a map of effect components, as described below in the effect components section.

''' Level-Based Values '''
* Many effects of enchantments depend on the level of the enchantment. For these fields, a type called "Level-Based Value" is used. In their most basic form, level-based values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.
* If a level-based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a type field, specifying one of the following types:
** <code>linear</code>
*** The most common type of level-based value is a linear value. A linear level-based value has two fields:
**** <code>base</code>: the base value added to all levels.
**** <code>per_level_above_first</code>: amount added for each level above the first one.
*** In effect, a <code>linear</code> level-based value results in <math>base + per\_level\_above\_first * (level - 1)</math>.
** <code>clamped</code>
*** A level-based value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:
**** <code>value</code>: a level-based value used as the input.
**** <code>min</code>: a floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output.
**** <code>max</code>: a floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output.
** <code>fraction</code>
*** A level-based value type that represents the fraction between two values. Fields:
**** <code>numerator</code>: a level-based value used as the numerator.
**** <code>denominator</code>: a level-based value used as the denominator.
** <code>levels_squared</code>
*** A level-based value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:
**** <code>added</code>: a floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels.
*** In effect, a levels_squared level-based value results in <math>level ^ 2 + added</math>.

''' Value effect types '''

*** A value effect that overwrites the input value with a given level-based value.
*** Fields:
**** <code>value</code>: the level-based value to use as the result.

''' Attribute effects '''
* They use the attribute system to apply an attribute modifier whenever the enchanted item is correctly equipped. Attribute effects do not have a dynamic type - they are all the same type.
* Fields:
** <code>name</code>: the name of the attribute modifier to add.
** <code>attribute</code>: the ID of the attribute to modify.
** <code>operation</code>: the operation of the attribute modifier.
*** One of <code>add_value</code>, <code>add_multiplied_base</code> and <code>add_multiplied_total</code>
** <code>amount</code>: a level-based value describing the amount.
** <code>uuid</code>: a string containing a UUID for the attribute modifier to use.
*** Must be unique to avoid different enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others.

''' Entity effect types '''
* Enchantment effects that generally do something to an entity involved in an event. Which entity is affected depends on the specific component being configured.
** <code>all_of</code>

''' Location-based effect types '''
* Special effects that activate and deactivate depending on where the owner of the enchanted item moves. Location-based effect only trigger when such items are initially equipped and subsequently when the owning entity moves to a new space in the block grid - i.e. when their coordinates change to a new integer value.
* All entity effect types can also be used as Location-Based effects, and in addition <code>attribute</code> can be used to specify an Attribute effect as a location-based effect.

''' Effect conditions '''
* Most enchantment effects are filtered using conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each effect component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set. Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the effect components list below.
* Damage parameters
** Entities: <code>this</code>, <code>attacker</code>, <code>direct_attacker</code>
** Enchantment level
** Origin
** Damage source
* Item parameters
** Tool
** Enchantment level
* Location parameters
** Entities: <code>this</code>
** Enchantment level
** Origin
** Enchantment active status
* Entity parameters
** Entities: <code>this</code>
** Enchantment level
** Origin

''' Effect components '''
* The <code>effects</code> field in an enchantment is a map of effect component type the effect list data. Most effect components are lists, so any number of effects can be added of any component type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and effect type, but some effects also deviate from this format.
* In cases where the documentation specifies a condition context and effect, the component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named <code>effect</code> with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named <code>requirements</code> specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.
** <code>minecraft:armor_effectiveness</code>: effects for changing the armor effectiveness of the target of an attack.
*** Condition context: damage parameters
*** Effect: value effect on the armor effectiveness: 0 for completely ineffective, 1 for fully effective.
** <code>minecraft:attributes</code>: unfiltered list of attribute effects.
** <code>minecraft:ammo_use</code>: effects for ammunition being used when drawing a projectile weapon (firing a bow or loading a crossbow)
*** Condition context: item parameters - tool is the ammunition item.
*** Effect: value effect on the amount of ammunition being used up.
** <code>minecraft:block_experience</code>: effects for the amount of experience that drops when mining a block with the enchanted item.
*** Condition context: item parameters - tool is the mining tool used.
*** Effect: value effect on the amount of experience awarded.
** <code>minecraft:crossbow_charge_sounds</code>: effect for changing the charging sounds of a crossbow.

== Experimental ==
The features that were previously under the "Update 1.21" [[experimental]] toggle have been de-experimentified. This means they can be accessed by simply playing the game normally. This change was made because this snapshot is the first snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.21|1.21]], which makes the features for 1.21 available in normal gameplay.

* Removed the <code>update_1_21</code> feature flag and built-in data pack.
** The features that were previously under the built-in data pack <code>update_1_21</code> have been "de-experimentified" and are now available during normal gameplay.

== Trivia ==
* This [[snapshot]] was the first time a new [[panorama]] was introduced with the first snapshot of an update.
* This snapshot had a notable bug in which shapeless crafting recipes did not always consume all the items in the crafting grid. This meant that some items could be (partially) duplicated.
