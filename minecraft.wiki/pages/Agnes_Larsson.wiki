As her programming experience progressed, Larsson was made development manager and senior gameplay developer in April 2019, then lead gameplay developer for ''Minecraft'' in April 2020, and in February 2021, she was promoted to ''Minecraft'' Vanilla Game Director.<ref name="linkedin"/><ref>{{tweet|_LadyAgnes|1367218482320994309|Ahh! I got promoted to Vanilla Minecraft Game Director!|March 3, 2021}}</ref>

Larsson serves as a spokesperson for Mojang Studios as she holds ''Minecraft'' workshops for children, for example.<ref name="forbes"/> Her goal as a development manager is to create as much player happiness as possible using ''Minecraft'' Java and Bedrock [[Version history|updates]], encompassing various gameplay styles, whereas keeping the principles of the game's inclusivity and simplicity, which include the dynamic of one block at a time.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/11/17/minecraft-update-release-date/</ref> With the nickname of ''LadyAgnes'', Agnes Larsson is known for appearing in the [[Minecraft Live 2020|Minecraft Live]] teaser videos that show her and [[Jens Bergensten]] in a two-dimensional type of ''Minecraft''. Nir Vaknin, a ''Minecraft'' gameplay developer,<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/in/nir-vaknin-06998670/?originalSubdomain=il Nir Vaknin on Linkedin]</ref> trivially told during [[Minecraft Live 2020]] that Agnes likes to make the roofs of her houses with [[wool]]. In ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', a painting of her character on a church seems to be fancier than the other paintings and it has a [[cat]] besides her. Agnes' ''Minecraft'' character also appears in the screenshot of Mojang's blog post about the [[Java Edition 16w43a]] snapshot, where it is pictured [[fishing]] in a [[river]] biome.

In April 2022, Larsson did a {{w|TED Talk}} in Vancouver, Canada, under the topic "The Awesome Potential of Many Metaverses".<ref name="ted"/> In the talk, Larsson demonstrated how ''Minecraft'' worlds act as unique metaverses where players can express their creativity.
