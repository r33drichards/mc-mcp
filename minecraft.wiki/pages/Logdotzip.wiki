'''Tyler Christopher Pappas''' (born November 6, 1991), better known by his online pseudonym '''Logdotzip''', is an American [[YouTube]]r known for creating videos on [[mod]]s.

== In the ''Minecraft'' franchise ==
In 2017, he starred as one of the co-hosts of the pre-show for [[MINECON Earth 2017]], alongside [[Julia Hardy]]. From 2017 to 2018, he was invited to [[Minecraft Creator Summit]], alongside other creators such as [[Grian]] and [[Anthony Viviano]].<ref>{{Tweet|Logdotzip|1002458911117660160|Loved once again being a part of the #MinecraftCreatorSummit2018 😁 - got a chance to meet your (other) favorite YouTubers, and the teams at Microsoft and Mojang that make it all possible.

=== Coral Crafters ===
{{main|Coral Crafters}}
In 2018, as part of the promotion for the [[Update Aquatic]], [[Mojang Studios]] began an initiative to invest in preservation of {{Wikipedia|coral reefs}}. Alongside Rabahrex and [[StacyPlays]], Logdotzip was hired to design a {{Wikipedia|biorock}} structure to be installed off the coast of {{Wikipedia|Cozumel}}, {{Wikipedia|Mexico}}. He ended up designing three options, to be voted for on a Facebook poll. These included the "Throne of the [[Guardian]]," a set of giant [[Turtle Egg|turtle eggs]], and a [[Block of Gold|golden]] [[trident]] resting on an [[anvil]].<ref>{{Mcnet|help-minecraft-help-oceans|Help Minecraft Help the Oceans!|April 18, 2018|Marsh Davies}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Voting is now closed - thanks to everyone who voted!<br><br>Help Minecraft help the oceans!<br><br>Vote on which of Logdotzip’s designs are used as part of our Coral Crafters regrowth project! Voting ends Monday, April 23.|author=Minecraft|website=Facebook|date=April 18, 2018|url=https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AAiVx5J1N/}}</ref>

Ultimately, the eggs were chosen, with the campaign being considered a success.<ref>{{YouTube link|iFXkUgYMURc|Coral Crafters – How Minecraft Helped the Oceans!|Minecraft|June 26, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|giving-back-ocean-coral-crafters|Giving back to the ocean with Coral Crafters|September 13, 2023|Staff}}</ref>

In 2016, he provided the narrator of a [[Minecraft Campfire Tales Skin Pack|trailer]] for the [[Campfire Tales Skin Pack]].<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|792018090825482240|The summoning is complete: the Campfire Tales are resurrected in TERRIFYING VIDEO FORM as read by @Logdotzip:|October 28, 2016}}</ref> Later, he would begin developing many projects for the [[Marketplace]], including [[Lucky's Minigame Mayhem]]. He would also be included in [[YouTube Creators Skin Pack]], celebrating a trillion views of the game being achieved on YouTube. The rendition of his skin would be reused in [[Caves & Cliffs Explorers]], where he plays a tertiary role in the story.
