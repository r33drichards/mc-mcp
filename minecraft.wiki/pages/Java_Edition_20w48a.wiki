'''20w48a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on November 25, 2020,<ref>{{snap|20w48a|November 25, 2020}}</ref> which adds [[dripstone block]]s and [[pointed dripstone]].

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Dripstone Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Dripstone block]]'''
* Decoration block.
* Does not generate anywhere currently, is only available from the Creative inventory.

'''[[File:Pointed Dripstone Tip (down texture) JE1.png|32px]] [[Pointed dripstone]]'''
* Can be placed on the floor or ceiling, creating stalagmites or stalactites respectively.
** Can be combined to form longer stalactites and stalagmites.
* Stalagmites break if not attached to something below, and hurt [[entities]] which fall on top of them.
** Enemies that fall on the stalagmites deal three times more fall damage
* Stalactites fall if unsupported, and hurt entities they fall on.
** Damage is relative to height: For example, one falling from 2 blocks deals {{hp|2}} of damage, and one falling from 3 blocks deal {{hp|4}} of damage.
** They drip [[water]] or [[lava]] into [[cauldron]]s if a source block is placed above the stalactite, and gradually fill the cauldron. Water drips even without any water above the block, but does not fill the cauldron.
* Thrown [[trident]]s break pointed dripstone.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Gamerule]]s'''
* <code>freezeDamage</code>
** Whether entities take damage from freezing inside of [[powder snow]].

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added new <code>freeze_immune_wearables</code> item tag.
** Contains leather boots, leather pants, leather tunic, and leather cap.
** Having an item in this tag in an armor slot prevents players from freezing.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added new particle types: <code>dripping_dripstone_lava</code>, <code>dripping_dripstone_water</code>, <code>falling_dripstone_lava</code>, and <code>falling_drip_water</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Budding amethyst]]'''
* The texture has been changed. Has a more prominent "X" in its center.

'''[[Block of amethyst]]'''
* The texture has been changed. It is now slightly less busy, striking a middle ground between the [[20w45a]] and [[20w46a]] textures.

'''[[Candle]]s'''
* Can now only be placed on solid surfaces.
** If the block a candle is placed on is broken, the candle stays floating. 

'''[[Cut copper slab]]s'''
* Crafting all variants of cut copper into slabs now gives 6 slabs instead of 4.

'''[[Powder snow]]'''
* Players in [[Creative]] mode can now freeze.

=== Items ===
'''[[Bundle]]'''
* Now show fullness as a number when advanced tooltips are enabled.
* Right-clicking a bundle in the inventory now empties one item from the bundle.
* Using a bundle now throws out its entire content into the world.

'''[[Candle]]'''
* The item textures have been changed to only have one candle.

'''[[Clock]]'''
* The texture has been changed. The gold is now more vibrant and better matches other instances of gold in the [[Texture Update]] textures.

'''[[Compass]] and [[lodestone compass]]'''
* The texture has been changed. The iron is now more vibrant and better matches other instances of iron in the Texture Update textures.

'''Leather [[armor]]'''
* Wearing any piece of leather armor now prevents freezing entirely.

'''[[Spyglass]]'''
* Now a 3D model instead of a flat sprite.
* Using the spyglass now better anchors it to the player's "eye" when viewed in 3rd person.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* Some recipe-unlocking advancements had criteria names changed.
* The chiseled nether bricks recipe is now unlocked by having a nether brick slab instead of a nether bricks block.<!--This was the only chiseled block changed-->

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* The <code>snow_step_sound_blocks</code> block tag was renamed to <code>inside_step_sound_block</code>.
