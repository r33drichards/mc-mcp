'''15w34b''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on August 20, 2015<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/08/minecraft-snapshot-15w34a</ref> to fix some bugs from and extend features of [[15w34a]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Repeating Command Block JE1.png; Impulse Command Block JE2.png; Chain Command Block JE1.png|32px}} [[Command block]]s'''
* Improved handling of flow with failing commands.
* 2 new settings - "Unconditional" and "Conditional".
** Defaults to "Unconditional".
** When "Conditional" is set, it only executes when the command block behind it was successful in execution.
* Now supports tab auto-completion.

=== Items ===
'''[[Armor]]'''
* Armor points now depend on armor durability.
** When armor reaches half durability, armor points decrease to 1 (half an armor bar). 

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Give off brown heart [[particles]] when hurt.
** The amount depends on the damage dealt.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[File:Minecart with Command Block JE2.png|32px]] [[Minecarts with command blocks]]'''
* Now have the impulse command block variant texture.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* New 'Attack Speed' attribute, <code>generic.attackSpeed</code>, measuring fully-charged attacks per second. Base is 4.0, meaning the bar refills in 0.25s.
** [[Sword]]s, [[pickaxe]]s, and [[shovel]]s have a modifier of -2.75, resulting in a value of 1.25 (bar refilling in 0.8s).
** [[Axe]]s have a modifier of -3.2, resulting in a value of 0.8 (bar refilling in 1.25s).
** The {{EffectLink|Haste}} effect increases the attack speed by 10%, while {{EffectLink|Mining Fatigue}} decreases it by 10%.
