=== Natural generation ===
[[File:CaveFossil.png|thumb|Bone blocks generated naturally underground as part of a fossil.]]
Bone blocks are generated naturally as part of [[fossil]] structures found in [[desert]] and [[swamp]] biomes. They also generate as part of [[nether fossil]]s in [[soul sand valley]] biomes and also in [[trial chambers]] indicating [[trial spawner]]s if it is a [[skeleton]] and a mixture with [[podzol]] indicating if it is a [[bogged]].
