The '''crab''' was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2023 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[Minecraft Live 2023]], alongside the [[armadillo]] and [[penguin]].<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-crab|Mob Vote: Crab|October 3, 2023|Sophie Austin}}</ref> It would have spawned in [[mangrove swamp]]s, and had a large arm that it could lose, dropping a crab claw. The crab claw could be used to place blocks from further away. Crabs could be bred with [[kelp]]. Crabs occasionally waved at players and other crabs.<ref>{{tweet|ZouChenyunfei|1710728806372458512|MOB VOTE NEWS<br><br>The descriptions of Mob Vote 2023 in Minecraft China Edition are a little different, I translated them!<br><br>So maybe we can find something new in these texts:<br><br>#Minecraft #MinecraftLive #MinecraftMobVote|October 7, 2023}}</ref>

The crab lost the vote with only 32.5% of the votes.
