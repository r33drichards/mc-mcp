==== Summary ====
Narrator narrates over footage of the [[The End|End]], trying to build up hype and intrigue over the [[Ender Dragon]], before [[Samuel Åberg]] interrupts and confirms the mob is in fact a dragon. Undeterred, Narrator continues the exposition, but is disappointed again when Samuel continues explaining its design, jokingly comparing the execution of the mob to a "growly fly." After the title card of the show appears, several [[Mojang Studios]] employees explain the personality of the Ender Dragon. [[Jens Bergensten]] calls it aggressive but lonely, [[Agnes Larsson]] emphasizes its size and scale, and [[Jasper Boerstra]] highlights the effect done for its tail. The subject changes to its sound, before Narrator ends up making a joke which offends an [[enderman]] watching the show on a smartphone.

From there, Jens reveals the lore of the End, explaining that the endermen and Ender Dragon are actually sworn enemies. Narrator is shocked by this revelation and begs to know more, only for Jasper to boast that he knows the answer and won't say. Calling his bluff, Narrator begins to speculate on the Ender Dragon's purpose, proposing it guards something, which Jens is confused by. Annoyed, Narrator affirms the show is for explanations, not more questions, transitioning to an explanation of the [[Adventure Update]] and its then-new features, such as [[Potion|potions]], [[enchantments]], and the introduction of [[Mob|boss]] mobs. Jens elaborates, touching on [[Markus Persson]] experimenting with a [[sky dimension]], which eventually became the End.

Narrator proceeds to touch on the "nothingness" of the End, pointing out it has no [[time]], and Samuel highlighting the [[Void]]. Jasper then says his head is empty, as Narrator compares it to the End, failing to make a joke. Narrator then asks where the name End came from, Jens saying it came from enderman, but also works as meaning the end of the game, and "the Ender Dragon's world." Jens clarifies it's the ender''men''<nowiki/>'s world, and touches on its origins as a reference to the {{Wikipedia|Slenderman}}. Narrator then transitions to VHS footage of [[Villager|villagers]] throwing [[Snowball|snowballs]] at the Ender Dragon to represent game development, before cheering the game "finally had an end goal!" However, Jens then stresses that the fight is entirely optional, Agnes affirming it's meant to "aspirational" and Samuel comparing it to the end of ''an'' adventure. Narrator follows this up by saying mob development is "tricky," and shows test images of the Ender Dragon flying above a [[forest]], without any textures.

As Jasper compliments the design and feel of the mob, Narrator is relieved there were "never any problems with the design." Once again, he is let down, as Jens laments that the original fight was very simple. Motivated, Narrator begins listing off ideas on a chalkboard, before Jens explains "some good ideas," such as [[End Crystal|end crystals]] and the [[Iron Bars|iron cages]] surrounding them. Another change was having the dragon swoop down to the [[exit portal]], incentivizing a change in approach. Narrator then starts listing off its attacks, all being used on a defenseless [[chicken]]. Samuel then mentions the sound design, particularly the crackling cry of defeat, followed by Agnes praising the [[End Poem]]. Narrator then insults endermen again, before calling them handsome, and Jens admits the Ender Dragon was rushed to meet a deadline.

==== Summary ====
Narrator compares chickens to [[Dolphin|dolphins]]. Agnes then affirms that chickens are just chickens, "nothing else." Jens questions if they are actually a duck, and Jasper thinks they look like one. Narrator claims this is an abridged cut of a 16 hour long debate over the opening title screen, before explaining chickens were added in 2010 in a [[Seecret Updates|seecret update]]. He jokes that he will be arrested for mentioning them.

Anges recounts the first time she saw a chicken in-game, going around collecting all their [[Egg|eggs]], equating them to [[Gold Ingot|gold]] or a [[diamond]] due to their newness. Narrator calls chickens one of "''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s most magnificent creatures," only to be let down when Jens clarifies they're very common. Samuel then establishes that mobs are designed to be "ugly cute," a practice Narrator compares to advice from his mother. He is again let down when Jasper says they're designed to be clumsy, before Agnes gets excited over a chicken plush toy and calls the in-game mob messy. Narrator reiterates they lay an egg every 5-10 minutes, and will follow the [[player]] when holding [[seeds]]. Samuel then tells a story about returning to his house filled with chickens, represented by [[Makena]] entering a house and is then swarmed with them like a water hose.

The hosts list off various ways to contain chickens, such as [[Fence|fences]] and a grinder. Narrator then mentions baby chickens, which set the standard for baby mobs using an oversized head and mixelated body. Narrator and Jens then agree ''Minecraft'' is not accurate to real life. The subject changes to them spawning in [[Jungle|jungles]], where they are hunted by [[Ocelot|ocelots]], which Agnes finds immersive. Their secret weapon, Narrator argues, is being immune to [[fall damage]], and then moves on to them being one [[block]] tall. While discussing the [[Texture Update]], he compares them to "going from gray to white, and then orange," showing a nonexistent orange chicken. Jasper then begins talking about their feet, which is actually a clever illusion; they're a bottom texture to a cuboid with only one other texture. A similar technique was used for other mobs, such as the [[axolotl]].

The subject changes to sound design, intended to sound both cartoonish and realistic all at once without being overly clean. After going over [[Raw Chicken|chicken meat]], Narrator establishes the [[Chicken Jockey|chicken jockey]] as a way to defend them. Jens establishes that the jockey was [[Nathan Adams]]' idea, which he simply found amusing and so added into the game. Agnes then expresses her belief that the chicken and [[zombie]] are "happy," and then Jasper talks about ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' taking the joke to its extreme, with the [[Dungeons:Chicken Jockey Tower|Chicken Jockey Tower]]. Jens then mentions chicken jockeys spawning in caves tended to drop too many eggs, causing performance issues. Narrator says this means they "almost broke ''Minecraft''!"

=== The Scariest Cow Ever Created ===

==== Summary ====
As the screen glitches out, the camera zooms down into the [[Deep Dark|deep dark]], as Narrator promises to explain the origins of the "scariest mob in ''Minecraft'' history!" The framing implies it to be the [[warden]], but it turns out to be a [[cow]] instead, created by [[Brandon Pearce]]. It's explained that the warden originated from a desire to evoke the feeling of older versions of the game, where things felt creepier and more desolate. Jens says his favorite thing about the mob is the mystery, several other employees describing various elements about it unknown to the player, while Narrator calls it a "big fan of introducing the player to the [[game over]] screen." 

Narrator begins describing the warden with various adjectives and descriptors, such as big, burly, beast, and smell sensitive. He explains that the concept originated during the development of the [[Nether Update]], where they came up with a blind mob, which evolved into an asymmetrical mob designed around stealth. The original idea, the stalker, was taller than an enderman, so it was given the ability to morph into a one-block tall form to never lose track of the player. It was decided to make it a cave mob, in order to make the challenge optional. After the stalker was phased out, a second design was tested, the hollowed. Narrator is traumatized by it.

All the developers collectively agreed it was too much, as Brandon explains it was based off trypophobia, the fear of holes. Narrator then states it's not to be confused with "Brandonphobia, the fear of Brandon ever pitching that idea ever again." Using the agreed upon elements of both the stalker and hollowed, the modern warden was conceived. Jasper explains the horns were inspired by the antenna of various insects, which catch vibrations. Narrator expounds on the warden's vibration detecting abilities, stressing that no matter how quiet someone is, eventually it ''will'' find them. This segues into a comical animated segment where a warden is sniffing a [[torchflower]], before a chicken arrives.

The subject transitions to the [[Ancient City|ancient cities]], Narrator teasing the many secrets found in the structure, but acting in denial over their abandoned state. Jasper explains that [[Sculk Shrieker|sculk shriekers]] were created as a warning system, demonstrated again by a chicken, and then says that the texture of [[sculk]] was inspired by opal. As Brandon elaborates on more of the horror aspects, Narrator laments the video isn't about a cow. Brandon then gives context for the "scariest cow," explaining it was used to test the [[darkness]] effect. Agnes then highlights the mouth of the warden, Samuel describing it as both scary and sad, like it's grieving. Finding that relatable, Narrator says the sound effects were made to be "key elements of the lore and feeling of this new experience." Samuel then goes over various of the sound effects, mentioning the warden's pulse was actually his.

As the video begins to wrap up, Jens chimes in on the warden's popularity within the fandom, pointing out it became a fan favorite very quickly and gave way to many differing interpretations. Agnes laments that, though many were scared of it, just as many appreciated the warden. As the video begins to glitch out again, Narrator implies the video is the series finale, as the warden does a jumpscare.
