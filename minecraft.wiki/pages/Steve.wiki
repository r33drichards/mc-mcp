'''Steve''' is one of the nine [[Skin#Default skins|default]] skins [[player]]s can use in ''[[Minecraft]]'', and the first to be introduced.

== Trivia ==
* Steve was first named via a depiction in ''Super Meat Boy'' by [[Notch]] as a joke<ref>{{Tumblr|notch|1390641415|Weekend activities|October 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027005600/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1390641415/weekend-activities}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|29566494948|@SuperMeatBoy http://twitpic.com/33e0n7 - Steve?|November 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|6825860292157440|@DrMeatBoy I honestly have no idea. And I tend to always put a question mark after his name (Steve?), you know. :D|November 22, 2010}}</ref> but later confirmed in the "change skin" menu on [[minecraft.net]], in-game as the default name {{in|be}}, and their name in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. Prior to this, the player was nameless.
** Even before this, [[mob entity]] models briefly present in [[Indev]] were already commonly referred to as "Steve" by the community.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/Minecraft-IRCLogs Minecraft IRC Logs], Adura.7z, 2010-01-29_#minecraft.log</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/796582-names-for-the-new-mobs|title=NAmes for the new mobs?|website=Minecraft Forum|author=Omega12|date=January 29, 2010}}</ref>
** Notch later clarified in a 2012 blog post titled ''Gender in Minecraft'', that the human model in ''Minecraft'' was designed as gender-neutral, representing a generic "Human Being" rather than a male or female.<ref name="gender-in-minecraft">{{WON|28188312756|Gender in Minecraft|July 28, 2012}}</ref> He regretted earlier use of masculine terms like "he" for the default character (at the time was colloquially called "Steve"), advocating instead for the gender-neutral "they".
* Prior to returning to the game in [[Java Edition 1.19.3]], Steve's beard remained depicted in promotional material and merchandise throughout its thirteen year absence.
* The original Steve skin and player model was originally created for another one of Notch's games called ''[[Zombie Town]]''.
* Steve's face was inspired by the unnamed player character model from ''{{Wikipedia|Quake (video game)|Quake}}''.<ref>{{tweet|notch|1530639838172663812|That's my understanding as well. Oh and steve's face was inspired by the quake character skin.<br><br>I'm not sure why that's so funny to me.|May 28, 2022}}</ref>
* The July–August 2016 issue of the ''{{Wikipedia|LEGO Club Magazine}}'' mentioned that Steve is Alex's boyfriend. In the issue after, they corrected themselves stating that Steve and Alex are "just good friends". It is also mentioned that Steve is a miner, builder, and alchemist, while Alex is a builder, explorer, and hunter.
* In ''[[Minecraft: Pocket Edition Lite]]'', the name of the player was "Stevie" instead of "Steve".
* In large part due to them being the only skins for an extended time, Steve is commonly paired with Alex.
* Prior to the [[Texture Update]], Steve's head appeared on the icons for [[nausea]] and [[glowing]].
