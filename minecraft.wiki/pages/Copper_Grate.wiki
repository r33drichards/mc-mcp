'''Copper grates''' are a variant of [[copper block]]s that have perforations that can be seen through.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Copper grates can be mined with a [[stone pickaxe]] or better. If a copper grate is broken without a [[pickaxe]], it drops nothing.

}}

=== Natural generation ===
Waxed copper grates of various oxidization stages generate naturally within the corridors of [[trial chambers]], mostly serving as wall-mounted walkways between different rooms. They are also featured on some walls and floors and can form dead ends within the halls, mostly with a [[chest]] in front.

== Usage ==
Copper grates are decorative [[transparent]] blocks that can oxidize. Copper grates do not conduct redstone, and [[mob]]s cannot spawn on top of them. They can also be [[waterlogged]].

Copper grates adjacent to other copper grates are invisible when viewed through a copper grate that is identical in states of oxidation and wax.

=== Oxidation ===
{{main|Oxidation}}
Non-waxed copper grates have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). [[Lightning bolt]]s and [[axe]]s can remove the oxidation on copper grates. Using a [[honeycomb]] on a copper grate prevents it from oxidizing.

As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.

== Trivia ==
* Copper grates were mainly inspired by chain link fences.<ref name="SarahTweet">[https://web.archive.org/web/20231031231639/https://twitter.com/SarahBoevingArt/status/1718161962041782577 @CagilMartin Two different blocks! The grates were more inspired by chain link fences etc. although the spleaves are cool too! 💖🙌] <small>this was archived incorrectly but you can still see the contents in page's source.</small></ref>
* In [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]], a block called "[[copper spleaves]]" was added, having a very similar appearance to the copper grates. Nevertheless, the two blocks are unrelated.<ref name="SarahTweet"/>
