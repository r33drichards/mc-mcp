* {{cmd|give}} and {{cmd|replaceitem}}
** Now reinforces item-specific stacking restrictions.<ref name=":0">{{bug|MC-117005|resolution=WAI}}</ref>
*** This is a reverse of [[16w32a]].<ref>{{bug|MC-105965|resolution=WAI}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Achievement/Java Edition|Achievements]]'''
* Removed and replaced by [[advancement]]s.

'''Controls'''
* Pressing {{key|F1}} now hides all toast messages.

'''[[Crafting]]'''
* Closing the crafting interface with items inside no longer drops the items in front of the player, but sends them instead to the inventory.

'''Creative'''
* Materials tab merged with miscellaneous tab in Creative mode.

'''Java version'''
* This is the first version to use, and thus require, Java 8.<ref name="java 8">{{tweet|Dinnerbone|847408242233704448|Heads up modders: This snapshot is the first Minecraft version to require (and therefore use) Java 8. You can now finally use 7/8 features!|March 31, 2017}}</ref>

'''[[Language]]'''
* Many pieces of text are now translatable, where previously they were hardcoded English.
** The full list of changes can be found [[/New translatable strings|here]].

'''Movement'''
* The player's body now entirely faces to the front, when moving backwards.<ref>{{bug|MC-114900}}, resolved as "Works as Intended" – Maria Lemón, April 22, 2017</ref><ref>{{reddit|66s2px/in_17w16b_players_can_now_run_backwards_without|dglwcfv|It actually is a bug, it tries to rotate the body to the direction you are walking, but it can only do it so far, that is also why it basically picks a 'random direction'. Now it can actually understand when it is walking backwards and it stopped doing that weird behavior.|_Grum|April 22, 2017}}</ref>
** Prior to this update, moving backwards would cause the player model to rotate one side, making it look like the player was strafing backwards somewhat.

'''NBT format'''
* Improved NBT parsing in commands.
** Keys can now (optionally) be quoted, e.g: <code>"Motion":[0.0,0.0,0.0]</code>.
** Unquoted string values are now stricter; they can no longer contain spaces or special symbols, e.g: <code>CustomName:Test Test</code>.
** Indices, which were previously optional in lists, are no longer allowed, e.g: <code>Motion:[0:7.3,1:1.0,2:3.1]</code>.
** Empty keys and values are no longer allowed.
* Improved error messaging; now points to where exactly the error occurred.

'''Optimizations'''
* Huge optimizations to [[Creative inventory]] searching.
* Optimized chunk loading.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* "Now Java 6!" changed to "Now Java 8!"
