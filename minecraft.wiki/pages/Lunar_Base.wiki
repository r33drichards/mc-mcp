'''ACME Self-Building Lunar Bases''' were joke [[feature]]s that could be found on [[the Moon]] in the April Fools' snapshot [[23w13a_or_b]].

== Generation ==
Lunar bases generate in the moon biome with a {{frac|1|1024}} chance to generate in a given chunk. {{info needed}}

== Structure ==
{{main|Lunar Base/Structure}}
Lunar bases look similar to moon rovers at first, with a dropper renamed to "ACME Self-Building Lunar Base" at the center. Pressing the golden pressure plate located on the rover starts the construction of an enormous lunar base. Adding objects to the dropper does not seem to change construction, although having blocks above it prevents it from starting to expand.

== Loot ==
Loot in the lunar base is located in two types of containers: chests, named "Moon Mission Resupply Crate", and green shulker boxes, named "Lunar Laboratory Equipment". The former generates basic resources to survive on the Moon, like dirt, saplings and vegetables to farm, while the latter can generate items unobtainable in normal Survival gameplay, such as [[spawn egg]]s and [[budding amethyst]], as well as a large variety of other items.

The dropper that activates the structure building has a special tag 'Lunar', and can be obtained through the command <code>setblock ~ ~ ~ dropper{Lunar:1b}</code>, and can be activated by a [[light weighted pressure plate]] or [[heavy weighted pressure plate]] placed above it.

== Trivia ==
* The "ACME" at the beginning of the lunar base's full name is likely a reference to the "Acme" threading put at the beginning of various companies' names in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a way of having said companies' names appear near the top of alphabetical lists, popularized as a generic company name by the fictional {{w|Acme Corporation}} of the {{w|Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner}} cartoons.
** While stylized as an acronym in-game, the term "acme" comes from the Greek ἀκμή (''acmḗ''), meaning "peak", "zenith" or "prime", though backronyms such as "A Company Making Everything" and "An American Company that Manufactures Everything" are popular folk etymologies.
* At the time of releasing the snapshot, the Lunar Laboratory Equipment loot table was the largest among all loot tables in the game.
