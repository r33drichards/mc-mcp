* A more expensive version of normal signs, which can be crafted with 2 [[Iron Chain|chain]]s and 6 [[stripped log]]s, yielding 6 of them.
* Has a total of 11 variants: [[File:Oak Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Oak Hanging Sign|oak]], [[File:Spruce Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Spruce Hanging Sign|spruce]], [[File:Birch Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Birch Hanging Sign|birch]], [[File:Jungle Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Jungle Hanging Sign|jungle]], [[File:Acacia Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Acacia Hanging Sign|acacia]], [[File:Dark Oak Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Dark Oak Hanging Sign|dark oak]], [[File:Mangrove Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Mangrove Hanging Sign|mangrove]], [[File:Cherry Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Cherry Hanging Sign|cherry]], [[File:Bamboo Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Bamboo Hanging Sign|bamboo]], [[File:Crimson Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Crimson Hanging Sign|crimson]], and [[File:Warped Hanging Sign.png|32px]] [[Warped Hanging Sign|warped]].
* Can be hung up in the following ways:
** Underneath a block that provides support in the center, like a fence or an iron bar.
*** When the hanging sign is placed underneath a non-full block, or when placed while sneaking, chains take on an upside-down v-shape. Signs in this configuration can be placed in 16 different angles, similar to an armor stand.
** Underneath a full block.
*** When the hanging sign is placed underneath a full block, chains are on parallel sides of the sign. Signs in this configuration can be placed in the 4 cardinal directions, North, South, East, and West.
** Attached to the solid side of a block.
*** When attached to the side of a block, its chains are parallel, hanging onto a horizontal bar sticking out from the side of said block. Hanging signs in this configuration display text perpendicular to the side of the block they were attached to.
** Attached to the side or underneath another hanging sign.
*** This displays the same way as being placed underneath a non-full block.
* Cannot be placed directly on the ground without support from the side or above.
** However, hanging signs that have a horizontal bar don't break when the supporting block is removed.
* If it is hanging underneath a block and that block is broken, the hanging sign also breaks immediately.
* Unlike regular signs, the space available for text is much smaller.
* Text can be dyed with any color of dye and tinted with [[glow ink sac]]s to make text glow.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
{{Load advancements|Smells interesting;Little sniffs;Planting the past;Crafting a new look;Smithing with style;Respecting the remnants;Careful restoration;The Power of Books}}

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]] triggers'''
* Added {{cd|recipe_crafted}} advancement trigger; triggered when crafting a recipe.
** Conditions:
*** {{cd|recipe_id}}: The resource location of the recipe crafted.
*** {{cd|ingredients}}: An array of predicates for the item stacks used in the recipe.
**** A single item stack can only be used to fulfill one predicate.
**** Each predicate needs to be fulfilled to trigger the advancement. This allows for seperation between recipes that have same identifier but use different ingredients.
**** This field is optional. When not provided, or left empty, only the {{cd|recipe_id}} dictates the success of the trigger.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* Added registry {{cd|trim_pattern}} and {{cd|trim_material}}, which defines trim patterns and materials respectively, to allow adding them via data packs.
** These are synchronized to clients when they join the server, but the accompanying resource pack is required on the client to make them visible.
** The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's {{cd|name}} field.
* {{cd|trim_pattern}} defines following data:
** {{cd|asset_id}}: a namespaced ID used to infer texture locations and localization.
** {{cd|template_item}}: the ID of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern.
** {{cd|description}}: a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor item stack.
* {{cd|trim_material}} defines following data:
** {{cd|asset_name}}: a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations.
** {{cd|ingredient}}: the ID of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material.
** {{cd|item_model_index}}: a float number which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material.
** {{cd|description}}: a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack.
*** The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern {{cd|description}} as well.
** {{cd|override_armor_materials}}: an optional map of armor material to overriden color palette.
*** Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette.
*** Map value is the name of the color palette that is used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material.

'''[[Font]]'''
* Added {{cd|unihex}} glyph provider.
** A new glyph provider for reading Unifont HEX files.
*** HEX format describes bitmap font glyphs.
**** Height of every glyph is 16 pixels.
**** Width of glyph can be 8, 16, 24 or 32 pixels.
*** Every line is made of two hexadecimal numbers separated by {{cd|:}}.
*** First value describes codepoint - it must have 4, 5 or 6 hex digits.
*** Second value describes glyph as a stream of bits, line by line.
** When rendering, empty columns on left and right side of glyph are removed.
*** Custom glyph widths can be set with {{cd|size_overrides}}.
** Provider requires two fields:
*** {{cd|hex_file}}: Path to ZIP archive containing one or more *.hex files (files in archive with different extensions are ignored).
*** {{cd|size_overrides}}: List of codepoint ranges that should have width different that auto-detected (based on empty space in glyph). Fields:
**** {{cd|from}}, {{cd|to}}: Start and end of codepoint range (inclusive).
**** {{cd|left}}, {{cd|right}}: Integers describing position of left-most and right-most columns of glyph in range.
***** Any bits in columns outside this range are discarded.
* Added {{cd|reference}} glyph provider.
** New glyph provider can be used to include providers from other fonts.
*** Providers are guaranteed to be loaded only once, no matter how many times they are included.
** Provider has one field {{cd|id}}, that describes other font to be included in currently loaded one.
*** Inclusion is performed after all fonts are loaded, so it includes all providers for a given font defined in all datapacks.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Lao.<ref group=note name=langadd>Also available for versions since [[22w42a]].</ref>
* Added Yakut.<ref group=note name=langadd />

'''[[Loot table]]s'''

** Controls what can be found by [[sniffer]]s when digging.

'''[[Music]]'''
* Added new ambient soundtracks, all by [[Aaron Cherof]].<ref group=note>Released to all 1.20 snapshots from 23w14a.</ref>
** "A Familiar Room" plays in Survival mode (all biomes), as well as in menu screens.
** "Bromeliad" play in [[bamboo jungle]], [[cherry grove]], [[flower forest]], [[forest]], [[jungle]], [[sparse jungle]], as well as the menu screens.
** "Crescent Dunes" plays in [[desert]], all types of [[badlands]], as well as the menu screens.
** "Echo in the Wind" plays in cherry grove, flower forest, [[lush caves]], all types of badlands, as well as the menu screens.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Added {{cd|cherry_leaves}}, which appear underneath the cherry leaves.

'''[[player.dat format]]'''
* Added new flag (value 128) to HideFlags NBT field for hiding armor trim item tooltips.

'''[[Recipe]]'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|smithing_transform|smithing_trim}} recipe serializers for the updated netherite upgrade and the new armor trim recipe respectively.

'''[[Resource pack]]{{verify|Were these additions really experimental in 1.19.4?}}'''
* Added {{cd|paletted_permutations}}, which is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes.
** Color palettes allow to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack.
** This is useful for things like armor trims. It can change the their color directly without create a new texture for each color.
** The {{cd|paletted_permutations}} source has a set of required parameters:
*** {{cd|textures}}: a list of namespaced locations of base textures.
**** These textures are used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes.
*** {{cd|palette_key}}: a namespaced location of a color palette key file.
**** A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below.
*** {{cd|permutations}}: a map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file.
**** The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a {{cd|_}} character separating the suffix and the base texture name.
**** The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture.
**** The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the {{cd|palette_key}} defined for this source.
**** Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the {{cd|palette_key}} to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette.
**** Alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel.
**** Pixels that do not match the {{cd|palette_key}} are copied over to the resulting texture as-is.
** After defining a {{cd|paletted_permutations}} source, those namespaced output textures can be referenced in other resources in resource pack.
*** For example, if the following {{cd|paletted_permutations}} source exists:
**** <syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
    "type": "paletted_permutations",
    "textures": [
        "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
        "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
        "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
        "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
    ],
    "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
    "permutations": {
        "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
        "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
        "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
*** The resulting textures can be referenced in other resources like this:
**** <syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
    "textures": {
        "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
        "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
        "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bed]]s, [[carpet]]s, and [[wool]]'''
* Colored variants can now be dyed any other color.

'''[[Block of amethyst]]'''
* Added a new behavior called vibration resonance when it is placed adjacent to [[sculk sensor]]s.
** If that sculk sensor receives a vibration, the block of amethyst re-emits its frequency as a separate vibration at its location.
** [[Sculk shrieker]]s and [[warden]]s are triggered by vibrations emitted by a resonating amethyst block.
* Added to the "Redstone Blocks" tab in the Creative inventory.

'''[[Button]]s'''
* Polished blackstone button now breaks in the same time as other buttons.

'''[[Dead coral]]'''
* Now listed in the same order as live corals in the Creative inventory.

'''[[Enchanting table]]'''
* A replaceable block between them and [[bookshelves]] no longer invalidates bonuses.

'''[[Jukebox]]'''
* Added to the "Redstone Blocks" tab in the Creative inventory.

'''[[Mangrove roots]] and [[muddy mangrove roots]]'''
* Are now grouped with [[log]]s rather than [[leaves]] in the Creative inventory.

'''[[Note block]]'''
* Mob [[head]]s can now be placed on top of note blocks without sneaking.
* When placing a mob head on a note block, that note block now plays one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by [[redstone]].

'''[[Player head]]'''
* Now can contain a {{nbt|string|note_block_sound}} NBT tag.
** Must be a [[resource location]] for a valid sound event.
** When present, this determines the sound a [[note block]] makes when the head is placed on top of it.

'''[[Sculk sensor]]'''
* Vibration frequencies of many actions in the game have been tweaked and greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference, as following:
:{| class="wikitable"
! Action
! Frequency value
|-
| Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
| 1
|-
| Landing on any surface (land or water)
| 2
|-
| Item interactions
| 3
|-
| Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (ravager roar, wolf shaking, etc)
| 4
|-
| Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
| 5
|-
| Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
| 6
|-
| Mobs and players getting damaged
| 7
|-
| Consuming items (drinking and eating)
| 8
|-
| Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
| 9
|-
| Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
| 10
|-
| Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc)
| 11
|-
| Blocks being destroyed
| 12
|-
| Blocks being placed
| 13
|-
| Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
| 14
|-
| Mobs and players dying or an explosion
| 15
|}
* Default redstone output has been modified to be more reliable for distance calculations.
* Now strongly powers the block they are placed on.
* Can now be activated by [[sniffer]]s digging.
* If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a sculk sensor, it stays queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking.
** This prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance.
* Now lasts 30 game ticks when in "Active" phase instead of 40.
* Now lasts 10 game ticks when in "Cooldown" phase instead of 1.

'''[[Sculk shrieker]]'''
* Scream sounds are no longer heard if block is waterlogged.
* Added to the "Redstone Blocks" tab in the Creative inventory.
* If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a sculk shrieker, it stays queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking.
** This prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance.

'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Sign text can now be edited by {{control|interacting}} with it after being placed in the world.
** Previous [[dye]] and [[glow ink sac]] effects are kept after editing.
** Signs can not be edited by players in Adventure mode.
* Both sides of the sign can now have separate text and colors.
** By default, a sign prompts the player to input the front side's text when placed.
** To apply text to the back-side, the player must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it.
* Signs can now also be waxed with [[honeycomb]], preventing any further edits to its text.
** Signs with non-text chat components can not be edited, even if the sign is not waxed.
* Signs save text even if the edit screen is closed by the player being moved far away.

=== Items ===
'''[[Armor]]'''
* Now can be visually customized with a variety of unique trims at the [[smithing table]].
* Purely visual with no gameplay benefits.
** All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color still changes based on the trim material.
** The name of the trim pattern is displayed on the item's tooltip.
* Armor trim has 2 properties: pattern and material.
** Pattern: Defined by the smithing template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim.
** Material: Defined by what ingredient is used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim.
*** Available ingredients:
**** {{ItemLink|Amethyst Shard}}
**** {{ItemLink|Copper Ingot}}
**** {{ItemLink|Diamond}}
**** {{ItemLink|Emerald}}
**** {{ItemLink|Gold Ingot}}
**** {{ItemLink|Iron Ingot}}
**** {{ItemLink|Lapis Lazuli}}
**** {{ItemLink|Nether Quartz}}
**** {{ItemLink|Netherite Ingot}}
**** {{ItemLink|Redstone Dust}}

'''[[Fish bucket]]s'''
* Are now listed in the same order as the fish items in the Creative inventory.

'''[[Potion]]s'''
* Wither [[effect]] particle colors have been adjusted to make them more distinguishable.
* Potion of [[Slow Falling]] has had its color tweaked to make it more distinguishable from the potion of [[Invisibility]].

'''[[Wither rose]]'''
* Is now grouped with other small flowers in the Creative inventory.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Elder guardian]]'''
* Drops [[tide armor trim]] upon death.

'''[[Slime]]s and [[magma cube]]s'''
* Are now affected by the [[Jump Boost]] effect.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]]'''
* Previous values are now always discarded if {{cd|interpolation_duration}} is 0.
* Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so {{cd|block_state}} is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at next tick after receiving update).
* Entities are not rendered unless initial data is received. That means display entities might not show on the first [[tick]].
** Due to how game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients with later tick.
* {{cd|item_display}} items have been rotated 180 degrees around Y axis to better match transformation applied when rendering items on armor stand head and in item frames.
** For reference, order of transformations applied to model (starting from innermost) is {{cd|item_transform}}, rotate Y 180, {{cd|transformation}} field, entity orientation ({{cd|billboard}} option + Rotation field + Pos field).

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* All fields in {{cd|placed_block}}, {{cd|item_used_on_block}}, and {{cd|allay_drop_item_on_block}} advancement triggers have been collapsed to a single location field.
** New location is similar to the player field - it's a list of loot conditions/predicates.
** All conditions in this list must match for a trigger to run.
* Conditions are evaluated in a new loot context called {{cd|advancement_location}}. It has access to:
** Player as {{cd|this}} entity.
** Position of the placed/interacted block.
** Block state of the placed/interacted block.
** Held/used item as "tool".
* Migration guide:
** Contents of old location field should be migrated to a {{cd|location_check}} condition.
** Contents of item field should be migrated to a {{cd|match_tool}} condition.
** Contents of block and state fields should be migrated to a {{cd|block_state_property}} condition.
* Advancement fields now have a new boolean field called {{cd|sends_telemetry_event}}.

'''[[Credits]]'''
* Updated to add some Mojang employees.
* Can be scrolled upwards by pressing {{key|Up}} now.

'''[[Damage type]]'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|outside_border|generic_kill}}.
** Players outside the world border are now hurt by the damage type {{cd|outside_border}} instead of {{cd|in_wall}}.
** Forcibly removing an entity using i.e. the {{cmd|kill}} command now uses damage type {{cd|generic_kill}} instead of {{cd|out_of_world}}.

'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* The data pack version is now {{cd|15}}.

'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Changed death message used for the {{cmd|link=none|kill}} command.
** Changed from "<''player''> fell out of the world" to "<''player''> was killed".
* Changed death message used for deaths caused by the world border.
** Changed from "<''player''> suffocated in a wall" to "<''player''> left the confines of this world".

'''[[Debug screen]]'''

'''Feature flags'''
* Removed {{cd|update_1_20}} feature flag and built-in datapack.

'''[[Loading world screen]]s'''
* Changed chunk colormap colors a little.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added new loot table function called {{cd|reference}}.
** New function {{cd|reference}} allows functions to call sub-functions (similar to {{cd|reference}} condition).
** Fields: {{cd|name}} - location of function to call
* Random sequences for loot tables are now deterministic.
** The game now uses named random sequences to deterministically produce loot for loot tables.
** Each random sequence produces a unique sequence based on the world seed and sequence identifier, which means a loot table produces the same results when ran with the same parameters in the same world.
** The identifier of the random sequence to use for a loot table is specified as a [[resource location]] in a new field called {{cd|random_sequence}}.
** The ID of the random sequence is an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

'''[[Music]]'''
* The places where the following existing music can be played are changed:<ref group=note>Changed to all 1.20 snapshots from 23w14a.</ref>
** "Aerie", "Firebugs", and "Labyrinthine" can no longer be played in the menu screens, and all types of jungle biomes.

'''[[Options]]'''
* GUI can be scaled on the Video Settings screen by holding {{key|Ctrl}} and scrolling the mouse wheel.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Condition {{cd|alternative}} has been renamed to {{cd|any_of}}.
* Added new condition {{cd|all_of}} that passes only when all sub-conditions pass.
** It has the same syntax as {{cd|any_of}}.

'''[[Recipe]]'''
* Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in {{cd|d=and|smithing_trim|smithing_transform}} recipes on fields template, base and addition.
** Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* The resource pack version is now {{cd|15}}.
** Updated the sprite layout of minecraft.png
** Removed the overriding minecraft.png from the Programmer Art resource pack.
** Updated the sprite layout of invite_icon.png.
** {{cd|legacy_unicode}} glyph provider has been removed.
** Bitmaps used by {{cd|uniform}} font have been removed.
* {{cd|uniform}} font has been updated to use Unifont 15.0.06.
** That changes shape of multiple characters, while also adding support for new ones.
** Combining characters no longer include circle overlayed over them.
** During the updates of Unifont, some CJK unified ideographs in [[wikipedia:Plane (Unicode)#Supplementary Ideographic Plane|Plane 2]] were added to the basic Unifont font files for coverage of the [[wikipedia:Table of General Standard Chinese Characters|General Standard Chinese Characters]] set, and some in Plane 3, notably the character [[wikipedia:Biangbiang noodles|biang from Biangbiang noodles]].
** Updated Hangul syllables and related characters, now with an overall bigger appearance.
** Minor updates to full-width punctuation and symbols in the range U+FF00 to U+FFEF.
** Minor updates to other individual glyphs, notably a much improved skunk glyph (U+1F9A8).<ref>[http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html GNU Unifont Glyphs - Unifoundry.com], [http://web.archive.org/web/20230523154307/http://unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html Archive on Wayback Machine]</ref>
* Added second level of organization of entries in credits.json on top of {{cd|titles}}, called {{cd|disciplines}}.

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Changes in encoding.
** The file is now read in UTF-8 initially, with previous encoding (ISO 8859-1/Latin 1) as a fallback.
** File is now written with UTF-8 encoding.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Step sounds can now combine for blocks walked through and stepped on.
** Occurs for [[carpet]]s, [[snow]], [[nether sprouts]] as well as [[Warped Roots|warped]] and [[crimson roots]].
*** The top-most block the player is walking on is played as normal.
*** The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch.
* Walking on a block now always plays a step sound.
** It was previously not the case if the player was walking along the edge of a block with air or fluid beside it.
* Walking on the ocean floor produces a step sound for the block the player is walking on, but at a lower volume and pitch.

'''[[Custom structure|Structure]] post-processors'''
* A {{cd|capped}} post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure.
** This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution.
** It has following required parameters:
*** {{cd|delegate}} - A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation.
*** {{cd|limit}} - Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform.
**** The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount.
**** Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing.
* Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed {{cd|output_nbt}} which would be added to the processed output block entity; this field has now been changed to reference a {{cd|block_entity_modifier}}.
** Existing {{cd|block_entity_modifier}}s are:
*** {{cd|passthrough}}: Retains existing fields on the block entity.
**** This is the default if no {{cd|block_entity_modifier}} is specified.
*** {{cd|append_static}}: Similar to previous {{cd|output_nbt}} this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity.
**** A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields.
*** {{cd|clear}}: Removes any existing fields on the block entity.
*** {{cd|append_loot}}: Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
**** {{cd|loot_table}}: Referenced loot table to add to block entity as {{cd|LootTable}} field.
**** Field {{cd|LootTableSeed}} is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position.

'''[[Telemetry]]'''
* Added new property: {{cd|launcher_name}}.
** A new global property sent with every event.
** This is set based on the minecraft.launcher.brand system property.
** This helps developers troubleshoot game launch related bugs more effectively, as they are able to see whether the issue originated in the Minecraft launcher or a third-party program.
* Added new property {{cd|realms_map_content}} to event {{cd|world_loaded}}.
** When loading into a Realms Map Content world (Minigame), the {{cd|world_loaded}} event receives the name of that map.
** This is to help developers understand how Java Realms users interact with Java Realms adventure or minimap content.
* Added new optional event {{cd|advancement_made}}.
** This event is triggered when a player completes an advancement.
** This allows developers to see the advancement ID and the time when the advancement was completed, and helps them as a studio understand player progress and limits, which informs their game design.
* Added new optional event {{cd|game_load_times}}.
** An event that is triggered when the game client is loaded, and includes the time it took for the client to load.
** This is so that developers can work on improving and reducing the time it takes to load the game client.

'''[[Title screen]]'''
* The [[panorama]] was changed to showcase a [[cherry grove]] biome.

'''General'''
* The game's application icon has been changed from [[crafting table]] to [[grass block]].
** Uses [[dirt]] icon for snapshots.
* Added native support for ARM64 machine architecture on Windows.
** Needs to manually specify a native Java Executable in the launcher currently.
* Removed the {{cd|server}} & {{cd|port}} arguments as their functionality has been replaced by Quick Play.
* Added support for four new command line arguments that allow the game to be launched directly into a world.
* {{cd|quickPlayPath}} takes a specified path for logging (relative to the run directory)
** If a path is provided the following are logged upon joining a world:
*** {{cd|type}}: is either {{cd|singleplayer}}, {{cd|multiplayer}}, or {{cd|realms}}
*** {{cd|identifier}}: represents the world player wants to join
**** For singleplayer, the folder name of the world
**** For multiplayer, the IP address of the server
**** For realms, the Realms ID
*** {{cd|port}}: represents the server port and is only logged for multiplayer
*** {{cd|name}}: The name of the world
*** {{cd|gamemode}}: The gamemode of the world
*** {{cd|lastPlayedTime}}: The time player joined the world
** Example:
*** {{cd|--quickPlayPath "quickPlay/log.json"}} resolves into {{cd|.minecraft/quickPlay/log.json}}
* {{cd|quickPlaySingleplayer}}, {{cd|quickPlayMultiplayer}} and {{cd|quickPlayRealms}} all take their respective {{cd|identifier}}
** If one of these arguments is provided, the game tries to launch directly into the given world
** Examples:
*** {{cd|--quickPlaySingleplayer "New World"}}
*** {{cd|--quickPlayMultiplayer "localhost:25565"}}
*** {{cd|--quickPlayRealms "1234"}}
* Improved performance of the light engine.
* To improve safety, the game now detects symbolic links used inside {{cd|world}} directory.
** If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game doesn't proceed with loading the world.
*** Note: world directory itself can still be linked.
** The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file {{cd|allowed_symlinks.txt}} in client or server top directory.
** The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
*** Lines starting with {{cd|#}} are comments and are ignored.
*** {{cd|[type]pattern}}, where type can be {{cd|glob}}, {{cd|regex}} or {{cd|prefix}}.
**** {{cd|prefix}} matches start of path with given pattern (so for {{cd|/test}} paths {{cd|d=and|/test|/test/|/test/foo.txt}} would match).
**** {{cd|regex}} matches regular expression against whole path.
**** {{cd|glob}} uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example {{cd|*.txt}} would usually match files with {{cd|txt}} extension).
**** Note: paths use OS-specific separators.
*** {{cd|pattern}}, which uses default {{cd|prefix}} type.

== Trivia ==
* The name of the update was not announced until March 2, 2023.
* According to Mojang developer Gnembon, not having too many features for the update pre-announced made it easier mentally for the development team, while also giving them more freedom to theme the update into something well received and welcomed by the community.<ref>{{ytl|ghQODkq4ITI|Mojang Dev Comes To Hermitcraft! (Mojang Developer Gnembom Interview)|GoodVodsWithScar|June 23, 2023|t=1502}}</ref> Being more relaxed while developing this update, the Mojang team also had greater mental capacity to tackle older issues in the game, such as fixing the bug with horse breeding and adding hopper/dropper support for jukeboxes.<ref>{{ytl|ghQODkq4ITI|Mojang Dev Comes To Hermitcraft! (Mojang Developer Gnembom Interview)|GoodVodsWithScar|June 23, 2023|t=1883}}</ref>
* [[Archaeology]] was originally planned to be a feature of the [[Java Edition 1.17|1.17]] update.
* Unused textures for the [[calibrated sculk sensor]] were first found in [[20w49a]] and later removed in [[21w13a]].
* This update returned "Removed [[Herobrine]]" to the official patch notes for major updates, following almost three years of absence from patch notes since [[Java Edition 1.16.2]].
