This page is about features that were included in {{3ds}}, but are leftovers or scrapped out of the game. Many of these were originally part of [[Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha]], from which the ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' is derived.

== Blocks and items ==
For the following blocks and items, except for the [[Stonecutter (old)|stonecutter]], only textures have been found so far. It is possible that they themselves may exist within the game files, but it has not been determined whether or not this is the case.

=== Map ===
{{main|Map}}
The [[map]] and empty map items were replaced with the map in the Touch Screen UI. Despite this, maps still internally exist as items (with valid item textures) and could be obtained in natural [[Stronghold#loot|stronghold chests]], but trying to select them would crash the game. Breaking the chest containing the map would allow the player to hold them.

=== Glowing Obsidian ===
{{main|Glowing Obsidian}}
Textures for glowing obsidian, a block dummied out of Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha, exist within the game files.

=== Nether Reactor Core ===
{{main|Nether Reactor Core}}
Textures for the nether reactor core, which was also dummied out of Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha, exist within the game files.

=== info_update ===
{{main|info_update}}
The default texture pack contains references to the two unused "<samp>[[info_update]]</samp>" blocks from ''[[Pocket Edition]]''. Their texture is also included in all texture packs.

=== reserved6 ===
{{main|reserved6}}
The default texture pack contains references to <samp>[[reserved6]]</samp>, a technical "block" in ''Pocket Edition'' that was used for referencing inventory slots. It shares the same placeholder texture as <samp>info_update</samp>.

=== Stonecutter ===
{{main|Stonecutter (old)}}
Like in ''Pocket Edition'', The [[Stonecutter (old)|stonecutter]] is obtainable in [[Creative mode]] only and is used solely for decorative purposes.

== Other ==
* The game files contain all of the skin packs that were in Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha, including some which are unavailable in-game on {{3ds}}: City Folk, Town Folk, Halloween Costumes, Minecraft Story Mode, and Villains.
* As in [[Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha]], the default ''Minecraft'' texture pack contains some textures for things that were not in the game yet (such as [[written book]]s), and the City and Plastic texture packs have even more (such as armor stands).
* Data relating to Microsoft HoloLens and [[virtual reality]] is in the game files, which only exists as a carryover from ''Pocket Edition''{{'}}s data.
