'''Mannequins''' are [[mob]]-like [[entities]] that resemble a [[player]]'s avatar without having a connected player.

== Spawning ==
Mannequins can only be spawned with {{cmd|summon}} or {{cmd|execute summon}}. They do not spawn naturally or have an associated [[spawn egg]].

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Mannequins do not drop any [[item]]s or [[experience]] upon death.

== Behavior ==
Mannequins function like a player avatar, even if the player is not connected. They can hold items in their hands, wear [[armor]], take damage, and have attributes and effects. Unlike [[player]]s, they cannot pick up items, though they can have items placed into their hands or armor slots with commands.

[[Vindicator]]s named "Johnny" will attack mannequins, but other hostile mobs will not.

Models will match those of players, with the specific exception of [[deadmau5]], whose ears will not render. Mojang have confirmed that this is not something they consider an issue.<ref>{{bug|MC-301771}}</ref>

Although player avatars do, mannequins will not take damage when outside the [[world border]].

** {{nbt|compound|profile}} Which profile to show on the entity. This is either a Player profile (same format as a <code>[[Data component format/profile|minecraft:profile]]</code> component) or a Mannequin profile with the following fields:
*** {{nbt|string|texture}} Namespaced ID of the skin texture to use. 
**** The skin is specified relative to the <code>textures</code> folder and with a <code>.png</code> suffix.

*** {{nbt|string|cape}} - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use.
**** When specified, uses the same format as the <code>texture</code> field.
**** Omitting this field means the mannequin has no cape.
**** Specifying an invalid resource location will result in use of the missing texture, rather than displaying no cape.
*** {{nbt|string|elytra}} - Optional namespaced ID of the elytra texture to use.
**** When specified, uses the same format as the <code>texture</code> field.
**** Omitting this field means the mannequin uses the cape texture, or if that is also omitted, the default elytra texture when wearing elytra.
**** Specifying an invalid resource location will result in use of the missing texture, rather than the default elytra.
*** {{nbt|string|model}} - Optional model type, one of <code>wide</code> and <code>slim</code>.

** {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|list}}{{nbt|compound|description}} - Optional [[text component]] shown where a [[Player]]'s <code>below_name</code> score would show.
*** The default "NPC" (<code>entity.minecraft.mannequin.label</code>) text is shown if omitted.
** {{nbt|bool|hide_description}} - Optional boolean specifying that no description should be shown at all.
*** A mannequin with the description hidden displays as if a [[Player]] had no <code>below_name</code> display.
