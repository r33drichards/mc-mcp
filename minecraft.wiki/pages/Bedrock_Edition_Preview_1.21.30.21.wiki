'''[[Structure Void]]'''
*{{cd|structure_void}} block state is removed and {{cd|air}} variants are converted to the base block.

'''[[Log]]s, [[Stripped Log]]s, [[Wood]]s, and [[Stripped Wood]]s'''
*All Logs, Stripped Logs, Woods, and Stripped Woods are now treated consistently across various scenarios:
**Flying mobs that can land on trees now recognize these blocks as suitable landing positions.
**[[Parrot]]s now prefer these blocks as landing spots.
**Previously, these behaviors applied only to a subset of these blocks.

=== General ===
'''[[Rarity]]'''
*The rarity of all items and blocks in the game has been re-evaluated to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
**Items and blocks become rarer depending on the following factors:
***The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops.
***The amount of traveling required to obtain it.
***The difficulty of any obstacle that must be overcome to obtain it.
***The possible amount of that item or block that exists in the world.
**Any item or block that can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients.
***For example, a mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity.
***Likewise, any crafted item that has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common.
**The lists below detail the items and blocks that have changed to that rarity category.

**If the base rarity of an item is Epic, it remains Epic when enchanted.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "Upcoming Creator Features" experimental toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''Add-Ons and Script Engine'''
*Added {{cd|item_display_transforms}} control to the block geometry file. This controls the way a block is visually represented in the UI, on the player, and floating on the ground. It exists inside the {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} json object and requires geometry {{cd|format_version}} 1.21.0 and the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle
**Default values example:
 "item_display_transforms": { "gui" : { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [30, 225, 0], "scale": [0.625, 0.625, 0.625], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "fit_to_frame" : true }, "firstperson_righthand": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 45, 0], "scale": [0.4, 0.4, 0.4], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "firstperson_lefthand": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, -135, 0], "scale": [0.4, 0.4, 0.4], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "thirdperson_righthand": { "translation": [0, 2.5, 0], "rotation": [75, 45, 0], "scale": [0.375, 0.375, 0.375], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "thirdperson_lefthand": { "translation": [0, 2.5, 0], "rotation": [75, 45, 0], "scale": [0.375, 0.375, 0.375], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "ground": { "translation": [0, 3.0, 0], "rotation": [0, 0, 0], "scale": [0.25, 0.25, 0.25], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "fixed": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 0, 0], "scale": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "head": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 0, 0], "scale": [1, 1, 1], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] } }

'''API'''
*{{cd|PlayerInteractWithBlockBeforeEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value is true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false if triggered on holding the interaction button.
*{{cd|PlayerInteractWithBlockAfterEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|beforeItemStack?: ItemStack}} to {{cd|beta}}. This is the item the player was selecting before the interaction succeeded.
**Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value is true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false if triggered on holding the interaction button.
**This after event no longer always triggers on an empty hand. The interaction with the block needs to be successful for it to trigger the after event.
*{{cd|PlayerInteractWithEntityAfterEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|beforeItemStack?: ItemStack}} to {{cd|beta}}. This is the item the player was selecting before the interaction succeeded.
**Cancelling the before event no longer triggers the after event.
**This event is now triggered only on a successful interaction.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''Graphical'''
*Removed an incorrect offset when interpolating keyframe values for the sun illuminance and sun color. Keyframe values for sun illuminance and sun color are now consistent with other time-based keyframe values. Creators need to shift any sun illuminance and color keyframes by 0.5. Documentation on the Creator portal has been updated accordingly.
*Added the ability to data-drive Sub Surface Scattering via Texture Sets in the Deferred Technical Preview. This effect allows light to penetrate the surface of objects up to a certain amount, similar to wax, leaves or skin. The default sub surface effect previously on leaves has been removed in favor of packs providing their own textures. Creators can use {{cd|metalness_emissive_roughness_subsurface}} instead of {{cd|metalness_emissive_roughness}} in their texture set JSONs to activate the effect on specific blocks, mobs, etc... Sub surface values are pulled from the alpha channel of the supplied texture. See updated documentation on the Creator portal for more information.
**Note that this new field is only available in texture set JSONs with a format version of {{cd|1.21.30}}.
*Changed the color grading JSON schema for the Deferred Technical Preview to now require explicit enabling of highlight and shadow specific color grading settings.
*Added highlight and shadow color grading controls to the Editor's Deferred Graphics Settings.
*Added the ability to data-drive emissive desaturation in the Deferred Technical Preview. See updated documentation on the Creator portal for more information.
*Added support for enchanted items in the Deferred Technical Preview.
*Reduced the smudging or "ghosting" artifacts that would occur when swinging the item in the player’s hand with Upscaling enabled in the Deferred Technical Preview.
