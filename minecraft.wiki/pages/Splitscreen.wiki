[[File:Join splitscreen.jpg|thumb|A second player joining a game in splitscreen.]]
A player can join a running game in splitscreen by connecting another [[controller]] and pressing {{xbtn|seriesmenu}}/{{nsbtn|plus}}/{{psbtn|options}}/{{psbtn|5options}}. The new player is then prompted to select a user profile in which their progress is saved. [[Vibrant Visuals]] is disabled on splitscreen and the game will switch to Fancy graphics.

If "[[Multiplayer]] Game" is enabled in the [[world settings]] of the current world, active Xbox Game Pass, Nintendo Switch Online, or PlayStation Plus subscriptions for each user profile are required to join the game.
