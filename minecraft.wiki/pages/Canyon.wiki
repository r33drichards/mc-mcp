'''Canyons'''<ref>{{snap|21w06a|February 10, 2021}}</ref> (formerly and commonly known as '''ravines''') are deep and long cracks breaching the underground layers of the [[Overworld]]. Occasionally, they may breach the surface, potentially exposing caves that would not normally be visible otherwise.

== Structure ==
Canyons are around 85 to 127 blocks in length and typically less than 15 blocks wide. [[Water]]-filled canyons can also be found in any [[ocean]] biome. Canyons are up to 62 blocks in depth and can start at levels 10 to 72. Canyons in [[amplified]] worlds and {{in|be}} may go all the way down to the [[bedrock]] layer, causing canyons spawning in mountainous [[biome]]s to appear deeper. A canyon extending down to bedrock causes [[lava]] sources to generate at the bottom. [[Obsidian]] often forms at the bottom as water [[spring]]s flow down into the lava.

Canyons may have small ledges along the top. Deep canyons sometimes spawn [[slime]]s or expose a [[diamond ore]] vein. Canyons may also be floored by the lava lakes at level -55 or even deeper.

Canyons can connect to caves, [[amethyst geode]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, [[stronghold]]s or any other generated [[structure]]s. Due to the large surface area of their walls, canyons often have water and lava flowing down them from springs in the walls, aquifers or openings to a lake or an ocean biome. A canyon that intersects a [[river]], a [[frozen river]] or a [[swamp]] is filled with stone under the body of water.

=== Lava lakes ===
[[File:Lava Ravine.png|thumb|A lava lake inside of a canyon.]]
Similarly to how lakes replace all [[air]] blocks below a certain altitude on the surface, when deep enough in a canyon, all blocks that would generate as air instead generate as lava lakes.

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|bedrock}} the [[Seed (world generation)|seed]] 1669320484 generates a huge canyon extending endlessly from southwest to northeast at [[coordinate]] X=−1269, Z=0, shaped by countless identical connected north-south canyons. There are other lines of canyons parallel to this one, but few of them are visible aboveground or have the canyons connected. This seed also generates parallel lines of endless [[dungeon]]s underground. As of 1.18, nearly all endless canyons are underground.
* It is relatively common to find multiple intersecting canyons, often running perpendicular to the parent canyon, on different Y levels. Before the introduction of large [[noise caves]] in 1.18, this phenomenon led to some of the largest possible caves in the game.
* An early version of canyons exist in an [[Java Edition Beta 1.2 02 (20110517)|unreleased build of Beta 1.2_02]], generating above and underground, and being noticeably shorter in height.
