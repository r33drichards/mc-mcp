'''The End''' is a dark, void-like, and space-like [[dimension]] consisting of separate islands in the [[void]], made out of [[End stone]]. It is inhabited by [[endermen]] and [[shulker]]s. The [[ender dragon]] also spawns when the player first arrives. The End is often considered the final goal of {{MC}}, and is usually the last dimension a player will travel to. The ender dragon is considered the final boss, and it is necessary to defeat it to return to the [[Overworld]] without [[dying]], "beat" the game, and see the [[End Poem]].

== Accessing ==
{{Main|End Portal}}
[[File:Active End Portal.png|thumb|right|An activated End portal found in a [[stronghold]].]]

To access the End, the [[player]] must go through the process of finding a [[stronghold]] using [[eyes of ender]], finding the portal room, and activating the [[End portal]] in the End portal room. The room consists of a 5×5 square of [[End portal frame]]s, with the corners cut out, making a total of 12. The portal hangs over a [[lava]] pool, with a staircase leading up to it. A [[silverfish]] [[Monster Spawner|spawner]] sits on top of the staircase. 

The player can activate the portal by filling the 12 [[End portal frame]]s each with an eye of ender. Each frame block has a 10% chance of generating with an eye in it. Once all the eyes of ender are placed, the portal activates and emits a loud noise. As soon as it is activated, the portal destroys all blocks in the central 3×3 square, including [[bedrock]] or another portal frame, and replaces them with the [[End portal block]]s that can teleport an entity into the End dimension. Upon jumping into the portal, the player immediately arrives in the End (x: 100, z: 0), along with any prior entities that may have teleported.

If [[cheats]] are enabled, players can also teleport to the End without using an End portal: the command {{cmd|execute in the_end}} allows the player to select their teleportation destination in the End directly.

== Environment ==
The End consists of one large island surrounded at a distance by many smaller islands, all mainly composed of [[End stone]]. There is a gap between the central island and the outer islands of about 1000 blocks with nothing but the [[void]].

The starless "sky" and the void of the End are both composed of a blank, static pattern (see [[End sky]]), colored slightly purple with Vibrant Visuals. The [[daylight cycle]] is absent in the End, similar to [[the Nether]], being replaced by a constant dim [[light]].
[[File:End Supernova.jpeg|thumb|An End flash.]]
{{IN|BE}} with [[Vibrant Visuals]] enabled and {{in|java}}, the sky periodically flashes and emits purple light while also producing sounds. The purple light acts as sky light.

The [[weather]] cycle does not exist in the End, meaning there is no [[rain]], [[snowfall]], or [[thunderstorm]]s.

Most [[item]]s and [[block]]s function in the End exactly as they do in the [[Overworld]], with a few notable exceptions:

* [[Bed]]s and [[respawn anchor]]s cause an [[explosion]] 25% stronger than [[TNT]] and cause [[fire]]s when one attempts to {{control|use}} them, as beds do in [[the Nether]] and respawn anchors in the [[Overworld]].
** [[Villager]]s, if somehow brought in, can still use [[bed]]s safely during night time in the Overworld.
* [[Compass]]es are unable to find the original [[spawn point]], as spawn points cannot be set within the End, but compass used on [[lodestone]] still works.
* [[Clock]]s are unable to determine the position of the [[sun]] and [[moon]], as there is no [[daylight cycle]] in the End. Clocks instead spin randomly as they do in the Nether.
* [[Eyes of ender]] cannot be thrown, since no [[stronghold]]s generate in the End.
* [[Nether portal]]s cannot be activated by the [[player]] in the End (although they can be placed through [[commands]] or external [[programs and editors]]).
* Fire burns indefinitely on [[bedrock]], but does not naturally spread onto other blocks of bedrock, as with [[netherrack]].
*[[Creaking heart]]s do not spawn [[creaking]]s when placed between two [[pale oak log]]s.
*[[Eyeblossom]]s do not change between open and closed states depending on the time of day.

=== Biomes ===
There are 5 [[biome]]s that make up the End {{in|java}}. Beds and respawn anchors still explode if the biome is set in the Overworld. {{IN|bedrock}}, all End biomes are classified as a single biome, which is <code>the_end</code>.

=== Features and generated structures ===
There are currently 9 [[features]] or [[Structure|generated structure]]s in The End:

|-
! Name
! width="500"| Description
! Image
|-
! scope="row" | {{anchor|Central Island}}[[The End#Biomes:The End|Central island]]
| The center of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely of [[End stone]], floating in the void. At a distance of 1000 blocks away, an expanse of more islands begins, away from the main island. These consist of large islands, about the size of the main island, and smaller ones, which tend to be thin.
| [[File:End.png|250px]]
|-
! scope="row" | [[The End#Outer islands|Outer islands]]
|The outer End islands are found 1000 blocks away from the central island. There are two types of outer islands: [[Small End Islands|small]] and large. The large islands are populated with [[chorus tree]] forests, and the occasional [[End city]]. Many large islands are empty. The player can go to the End islands through an [[End gateway]].
| [[File:ChorusFields.png|250px]]
|-
! scope="row" | {{anchor|Obsidian pillar}}[[End spike]]
|End spikes, also known as obsidian pillars, obsidian spikes or obsidian towers, are [[Structure|generated structure]]s at the End that are made of [[obsidian]], with a single [[bedrock]] block and an [[End crystal]] on top of each pillar. Larger ones have cylindrical forms. The pillars surround the exit portal in a roughly 40 block radius circle, and penetrate through the main island down to [[Altitude|y level 0]]. 
| [[File:EndSpike.png|250px]]
|-
! scope="row" | {{anchor|Obsidian platform}}[[End platform]]
|The End platform is a 5 by 5 square of obsidian that is generated once a player or entity enters the End. If the [[obsidian]] is destroyed, or if a block is placed on top of the three air blocks above any part of the platform when the player enters the End, the obsidian is restored and any blocks on top of those three air blocks above the platform are replaced with air, and dropped as an item.
| [[File:End-Platform-inGround.png|250px]]
|-
! scope="row" | {{anchor|Exit portal}}[[Exit portal]]
|The exit portal (also known as the End fountain) is a structure that enables the players to return to their spawn points in the [[Overworld]] or [[the Nether]]. It activates upon the defeat of the [[ender dragon]].
| [[File:Exit portal.png|250px]]
|-
! scope="row" | {{anchor|End gateway portal|End gateway}}[[End gateway]]

=== Terrain features ===
==== Main island ====
All players begin their exploration of the End with the main island. Unlike [[Nether portal]]s, entering the End portal instantly teleports the player to the End, giving no time to back out. Upon arrival in the End, the player is placed on a 5×5×1 [[obsidian platform]] with three layers of air blocks above it. If there are any blocks in a three-block space above the platform, they are destroyed when a player enters an End portal. The platform can generate on the island, within it, or at a short distance from it, close enough to throw an [[ender pearl]] to reach the island. It always generates centered on the coordinates (100, 49, 0) with the player facing west.

Once the player enters the End, the only way back (without prior setup) is to [[Health#Death|die]] or defeat the [[ender dragon]]. The dragon spawns naturally and flies around above ten [[End spike|towers]] of [[obsidian]] arranged in a circle around the central [[exit portal]], which activates when the dragon is killed. On top of each tower lies an [[End crystal]]. Some of the crystals are protected by cages of [[iron bars]]. These crystals heal the dragon but can be destroyed by hitting them (even with projectiles). Destroying the crystal while the dragon is healing damages the dragon.

Once defeated, the dragon goes to the [[exit portal]] at (0, 64, 0), rises into the sky, and disintegrates, with bright beams of light flashing from its body. It then explodes, drops 12,000 (first dragon) or 500 (all subsequent dragons) [[experience]] orbs, activates the exit portal, and generates one [[End gateway]] (first 20 dragons only). This gives the [[player]] access to the End's outer islands. Atop the exit portal lie four [[torch]]es and the [[dragon egg]]. After the dragon is killed, it can be [[respawn]]ed an unlimited number of times by placing four [[End crystal]]s on the sides of the exit portal. Respawning the ender dragon regenerates any obsidian pillar blocks previously mined by the player, as well as the torches on the exit portal. However, the dragon egg does not regenerate when a respawned ender dragon is killed.

[[File:EnderIslandsRender.jpg|thumb|right|The End's outer islands are clustered around the main island.]]

Once the [[player]] enters the exit portal, the "[[End Poem]]" is displayed, thereby "completing" the game. The player then [[respawn]]s wherever the spawn point is set in the [[Overworld]] or in [[the Nether]] and may return to the End through the same portal (or a different portal from another stronghold); the End remains in the same state as the player left it. The obsidian platform is regenerated each time a player enters the End, meaning that any blocks or block entities placed in the 5×5×4 space on or above the platform are destroyed and replaced with obsidian and air blocks.

==== Outer islands ====
{{Redirect|Ring|the mechanic related to bell|Bell#Usage}}
The End's outer islands are more diverse than the main island. When a player enters one of the [[End gateway]]s that [[Generated structures|generate]] after killing the dragon, they are instantly teleported over the ~1000 block void to the outer islands. These gateway portals are easiest to enter through the use of [[ender pearl]]s, due to the one block tall gap between the [[bedrock]] blocks, but can also be entered by placing water and swimming through, using a [[trapdoor]] or [[piston]] to force the player to crawl, or with skilled use of a pair of [[elytra]].

The outer islands vary in size. There are occasional "mini islands" in the gaps between the larger ones, generally with nothing on them (occasionally they generate [[End gateway]]s that return the player to the obsidian platform). The larger islands can also vary in size but are generally a hundred to several hundred blocks wide. The gaps between these islands are generally short enough that players can travel between them via [[ender pearl]]s.

These outer islands generate up to the [[world boundary]]. Some are topped with a forest of [[chorus tree]]s that may be harvested for its [[chorus fruit]], and perhaps [[chorus flower]]s, to grow it in the Overworld. The player may find [[End cities]] (which may generate [[End City#End ship|ships]] with them) on these islands, which hold exclusive loot. [[Elytra]] and the [[dragon head]] can only be found on the End ships.

{{IN|je}}, due to a bug,<ref name= "end-rings">{{bug|MC-159283}}</ref> the outer End islands generate in multiple concentric rings. The first ring ends at ±370,720 blocks laterally from (0, 0), cutting off terrain generation in a donut shape. It continues empty, but the second ring starts at ±524,288 blocks, then disappears again at ±642,112 blocks and comes back at ±741,455 blocks. It continues like this all the way until the world boundary, getting closer and closer. This is a [[hard limit]] caused by an arithmetic overflow when calculating the squared distance from the origin. Outer End islands can spawn at a set of coordinates (X,Z) if and only if they satisfy both <math>\sin\left(\frac{X^2+Z^2}{43748131634}\right)</math> and <math>X^2+Z^2-1,000,000</math> are greater than zero. Interestingly, each of the rings supporting outer island generation has the same area. The player can only access the first to 6,548th rings due to the [[world boundary]].

=== Mobs ===
The End is home to three naturally spawning [[mob]]s, with one additional related mob:
* {{EntityLink|Ender Dragon}}: Spawns naturally on the central island when the player first arrives, but can be respawned by placing 4 [[End crystal]]s, one on each side's middle block of the [[exit portal]].
* {{EntityLink|Enderman}}: Spawn naturally throughout the entire dimension.
* {{EntityLink|Shulker}}: Appear within [[End cities]] on the outer islands. They do not respawn once killed, but can sometimes clone themselves when attacked by another shulker.
* {{EntityLink|Endermite}}: Are associated with the End, but do not spawn naturally without player interaction.<ref>[[Minecraft: Mobspotter's Encyclopedia]], page 162</ref><ref>{{snap|25w46a|id=a|November 11, 2025}}</ref>

=== Blocks ===
==== Naturally generated ====
Naturally generated includes [[block]]s that are created through the [[Seed (world generation)|world seed]] and always generate no matter what.

== Trivia ==
*Developer [[Ulraf]] in a livestream was asked about if there were plans for an [[Major update|update]] to the End dimension, akin to the [[Nether Update]], and what Ulraf would personally want to see changed. In response, Ulraf stated that while there is little he can say, he expressed that he has played [[mod]]s that add features to the End and that he doesn't think they were on the "right track". To clarify, he explains that the End should still stay relatively empty, scary, and quiet, as those are aspects currently unique to the End. He believes that there needs to be more to the End than there is right now to address it being "a bit boring". He stated that he is anticipating the challenge of working on an update to the End, and that he is excited to work on it when they get to it. Regarding specific features, he expressed interest in adding new [[block]]s, [[Mob|creatures]], and [[structure]]s while still retaining the desolate feeling of the dimension by avoiding additions like too many plants. Lastly, he explained that he would really like to refine the [[ender dragon]] fight to make it more interesting and challenging.<ref> https://youtu.be/2cxUNoWNy50?t=11843</ref>
