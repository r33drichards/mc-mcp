'''[[File:Fire JE1.png|32px]] [[Fire]]'''

'''{{Animate|Birch Leaves JE1 BE2.png; Oak Leaves JE3 BE4.png; Spruce Leaves JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Leaves]]'''
* Leaves with the graphics level set to fast no longer act like opaque solid blocks, preventing blocks such as [[Torch]]es, [[Door]]s and [[Lever]]s to be placed on them and preventing mobs from naturally spawning on them.

* Now spread, although slowly.
