'''Podzol''' is a [[dirt]]-type [[block]] that naturally blankets the surface of the [[old growth taiga]] and [[bamboo jungle]]s, along with their respective variants. [[Grass block]]s and [[mycelium]] cannot spread to this block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Podzol can be broken using any [[tool]] or by hand, but the [[shovel]] is the quickest. It can be obtained using a tool with [[Silk Touch]], otherwise it drops [[dirt]] instead. 
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Podzol|drop=0|Shovel}}

=== Natural generation ===
Podzol generates only in [[old growth taiga]], [[bamboo jungle]] biomes and in [[trial chambers]] surrounding the [[bogged]] and the [[cave spider]] [[trial spawner]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===

[[Endermen]] can pick up podzol blocks, and drop it if holding it when killed.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s occasionally sell 3 podzol for 3 [[emerald]]s.

{{See also|Dirt#Renewability}}
[[File:SprucePodzol.png|thumb|The pattern in which large spruce trees replace blocks with podzol as it grows.]]
Podzol replaces the top-most [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[mycelium]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[moss block]]s, [[pale moss block]]s, [[muddy mangrove roots]], and [[mud]] around a large [[spruce tree]] when it is grown from 4 [[sapling]]s arranged in a square, as well as the blocks the saplings were planted on. {{IN|java}}, the pattern of the podzol reaches at most 6 blocks in the eastern and southern (positive X and Z) directions, and 5 blocks in the western and northern directions; vertically, it reaches at most 3 blocks above the ground and 2 blocks below the ground. {{IN|bedrock}}, the pattern of the podzol reaches at most 5 blocks horizontally in all directions, and vertically up to 2 blocks above the ground and up to 3 blocks below the ground.

[[File:Podzol Pattern.png|thumb|The maximum horizontal reach of podzol that can generate from a mega spruce tree.]]

Since podzol can be converted from moss blocks, and moss can be grown on renewable [[stone]], dirt can be renewably created as long as there is access to water, lava, moss, spruce saplings and [[bone meal]]. This is especially useful on maps where dirt is limited.

== Usage ==
Like [[mycelium]], podzol allows [[mushroom]]s to be placed on it no matter the [[light]] level, which allows the growth of [[huge mushroom]]s. [[Sapling]]s, all kinds of [[flower]]s, and [[sugar cane]] can be placed on it normally. A podzol block can be turned into a [[dirt path]] by pressing {{Control|use}} on it with any type of [[shovel]], but it cannot be tilled with a hoe to make [[farmland]].<ref>{{bug|MC-8231}}</ref> However, the player can first use the shovel on the podzol to turn it into dirt path, then use the hoe on the dirt path to turn it into farmland.

Unlike other similar blocks, podzol never spreads to dirt blocks, and it does not become dirt if a solid block is placed on top of it, no matter how long the block remains on top of it. Additionally, neither grass nor mycelium can spread to podzol.

* In real life, {{w|podzol|newtab=1}} is a type of soil characterized by infertility and acidity, and an ashy subsoil layer. One of the environments they typically appear in are boreal forests, or taigas.
