=== Crafting ===
All slabs have the same crafting recipe format, with one block resulting in two slabs each.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Slabs can occupy either the top half or the bottom half of a block, or both:
* Placing a slab on top of a [[block]] or on the side of a block in the lower half of the side surface creates a bottom slab.
* Placing a slab on the underside of a block or on the top half of the side surface creates a top slab.
* Placing a top and bottom slab of the same type in the same block creates a double slab block.
* It is possible to place two different kinds of slabs in the same block, but only by pushing one type of slab onto another type of slab which is right next to the world border via a piston.
* When a bottom slab has a top or bottom slab of a different type in the block above it (i.e., with one or two half blocks of air between the two different slabs), placing a slab that matches the one above onto the lower slab causes the slab above to become a double slab. The same behavior also occurs when placing different slabs underneath a top slab.

Slabs cannot be oriented vertically.

=== Behavior ===
[[File:Upside-downRedstone.png|right|thumb|An example of how top slabs can make redstone travel compactly "up stairs". Do note that redstone cannot travel down slabs.]]
[[File:Redstoneless Slab.png|thumb|right|Slabs do not block a vertical redstone connection as it is a transparent block.]]
[[File:Player sneaking under a slab.png|thumb|right|A player sneaking under a slab.]]

{{IN|bedrock}} a single slab (top or bottom) is [[transparent]] to light and diffuses sky light, while a double slab is opaque. The empty half of a slab block is also transparent to mobs, unlike other transparent blocks such as [[fence]]s and [[glass]], which players can see through but mobs cannot.

A bottom placed on top of a [[hopper]] is transparent to items; the items fall through the bottom slab into the hopper. Without a hopper attached below, a bottom slab behaves as a solid surface.

Falling block entities (like sand, gravel, and concrete powder) turn into their dropped form if they land on a bottom slab, as when they fall on a torch.

[[Mob]]s see a slab as a full block when pathfinding. They can spawn on top slabs and double slabs, but not on bottom slabs. This can be used to prevent mob spawning in certain areas, such as [[Tutorial:Mob farm|mob farms]].

Generally, the top face of top slabs, the bottom face of bottom slabs, and all faces of double slabs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, blocks that require a solid surface for placement can be placed on these faces.

Double slabs are handled as a single block instead of two different slabs; as such, breaking one destroys the whole block and drops two slabs, as opposed to breaking only one slab within the same block-space. "Double slabs" that are not aligned to the grid (i.e. a bottom slab on top of a top slab) are handled as separate blocks and are broken individually.

Redstone dust placed on a top slab receives signals from redstone dust one block lower and adjacent, but cannot transmit signals down to that block.

Due to the way blast rays propagate from an [[explosion]], bottom slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them. In some cases, only the slab is destroyed from a TNT explosion directly on top of it. Explosions from [[end crystal]]s and [[creeper]]s are also weakened.

[[Sneaking]] reduces the [[player]]'s hitbox height to 1.5 blocks, allowing the player to fit through such a gap (for example, walking over a bottom slab with one block of air above it, or in a two block high tunnel with an upper slab on the ceiling). A player cannot walk from a block of [[soul sand]] directly up to a bottom slab without jumping – this applies not just to soul sand, but to [[Solid block#Heights|any block]] {{frac|7|8}} of a block high or shorter, because the maximum step height of the player is 0.6 of a block. The player can walk off a bottom slab while sneaking, because the sneaking prevents falling only when the distance is higher than one half block.

If a single slab is placed in a water source block, or water is placed onto a single slab using a [[water bucket]], the empty half of that slab's block is waterlogged. If a slab is placed in flowing water, a pocket of air is created in the unfilled half of the block. If the player's head is in this pocket, the player can breathe and see as clearly as from an air block. {{IN|Java}}, if a single slab is placed in between two water sources or waterlogged blocks, the slab becomes waterlogged.

A minecart on powered rails is not repelled by a slab, although it is repelled by a slab with a minecart on top.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Any light directed through a slab does not affect any block's light values north of the source.
* Though single slabs in an otherwise flat floor composed of solid blocks are darkened as one would expect, the indented areas created by 2×1 or 2×2 stairs darken less because they have fewer surrounding solid blocks.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-31503}} resolved as "Works as Intended"</ref>
* When [[water]] or [[lava]] is on top of an upside-down slab, the water-dripping particles appear in midair below the slab instead of from the slab itself. This was fixed {{in|java}} [[Java Edition 1.13-pre7|1.13-pre7]]<ref>{{bug|MC-1390}}</ref> but will not be fixed {{in|bedrock}}.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-32639}}</ref>
* In 2017, Notch said that he regretted introducing slabs to the game because half blocks unnecessarily double the resolution of the game by adding detail outside of the game's otherwise cubic constraints.<ref>{{tweet|notch|909801759572414464|The only game related thing I regret is adding half-size slabs to Minecraft.|September 18, 2017}}</ref>
* Unlike [[stair]]s, many stone-type slabs have different [[Breaking#Blocks by hardness|hardness]] values (and thus, breaking time) compared to their full-block counterparts.<ref>{{bug|MC-53641}}</ref>
