A '''bell''' is a [[block]] that can be rung {{Control|use|text=by hand}}, with a [[projectile]] or using a [[redstone signal]] to make all nearby [[villager]]s run to their [[bed]]s. {{IN|je}}, this also [[Glowing|reveals]] all [[illager]]-related [[mobs]] in a large radius. It can be found in [[villages]] or [[Trading|purchased]] from villagers, and cannot be [[crafted]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A bell can be mined with anything, but [[pickaxe]]s are the fastest. A bell also breaks and drops itself if the block it is attached to is moved or destroyed, and, {{in|java}}, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Bell|pickaxe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Bells can generate naturally in all [[village]] variants, usually near the center of the village in the meeting point.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|bell}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Bells can be anchored to the side of blocks, ceilings, and floors and drop as an item if the sustain block is broken or moved by a piston. They can also be attached to trapdoors but break if the trapdoor is opened.

When the {{control|use}} control is pressed while looking at the side of a bell, it produces a sound as well as a "swaying" animation. A bell can also be rung using a [[redstone]] signal, by any projectile, or by dropping an [[item]] on it.{{Only|BE}}

If the player rings the bell while villagers are sleeping, all of the villagers wake up. Bells can be rung by players only from certain angles (villagers are not subject to this restriction); trying from an incorrect angle does not cause the bell to ring.

Villagers ring the bell only during raids.

=== Claiming ===
A villager can detect a bell within 48 blocks [[euclidean distance]] horizontally and 6 blocks vertically (either up or down) from the base of its hitbox. The villager can claim the bell if it gets within 6 blocks [[taxicab distance]] of the bell and there is a valid path that can lead them to be in the block beside the bell. Baby villagers do not claim nor ring a bell.   

When villagers spawn and have not already claimed a bed or workstation, they will automatically claim any bell within 6 blocks of them, even if they cannot reach it. Additionally, when a bell is placed within 48 blocks from the pillow of a claimed [[bed]] and there is a valid path a villager can walk through, the bell gets automatically claimed in the afternoon (between 9000t and 12000t), which is displayed by green particles appearing above the bell. This does not work with claimed workstations.

Claimed bells are [[Point of Interest|POIs]] and determine the position of a [[Village|village center]] among claimed beds and workstations.

When a player subject to the [[Bad Omen]] effect enters a village with a bell, the claiming mechanisms are forced no matter the time, meaning that if the bell is close enough either from a villager or from a claimed bed, it becomes part of the village.

A claimed bell defines a gathering site of a village, and villagers pathfind close to it in the afternoon.

If the bell is broken, anger particles appear above the village leader's head.{{only|be}}

If a player rings a bell, the villagers run to their beds even if there is no raid. Villagers can activate a bell even through blocks, but only if it was previously claimed and at least 2 blocks (also diagonal) from the base of their hitbox.

=== Raid ===
{{seealso|Tutorial:Defeating a village raid}}
When the bell is rung, villagers within a distance of 32 blocks run to the nearest bed within 32 blocks immediately.

{{IN|je}}, when a [[raid]]'s first wave appears, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before running to their beds. {{IN|bedrock}}, bells in the corresponding [[village]] ring automatically at the start of a raid, warning villagers to return to their beds.

==== Glowing effect ====
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
If a bell is rung and there is a raid mob within a 32 block spherical range, the [[Glowing]] effect is applied to all raid mobs within 48 blocks for 3 seconds, and {{EffectSprite|particle-bell-highlight-1}}{{EffectSprite|particle-bell-highlight-2}} particles appear. It produces a resonating sound once this process is complete. The raid mobs do not have to be actively participating in a raid to receive the Glowing effect; the effect applies to [[illager]]s in [[woodland mansion]]s, or [[witch]]es that naturally spawn in the Overworld.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s run toward any bell item on the ground, and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory. Breaking or ringing a bell does not aggravate them.<ref>{{bug|MC-179104||Piglins don't mind players mining bells near them|WAI}}</ref>

=== Redstone component ===
{{IN|je}}, bells ring one time upon receiving a redstone signal. Observers can detect when a bell receives a redstone signal, and when it stops receiving a signal (corresponding to the {{code|powered}} block state). Observers cannot detect when a bell is activated by the player or other entities. [[Sculk sensor]]s, however, can detect a bell being rung in any way, or when placed or broken. Bells are transparent blocks and cannot be powered.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[observer]]s can detect when a bell is rung. Observers do not emit a signal when the bell stops ringing or becomes unpowered. Bells also conduct redstone power {{in|bedrock}}.

{{IN|be}}, bells can only activate on the input/consume redstone tick ([[C-tick]]).

=== Piston interactivity ===
{{IN|je}}, bells are destroyed when [[piston]]s push them. It also can not be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

{{IN|be}}, bells can be pushed and pulled by both [[piston]]s and [[sticky piston]]s, but breaks if unsupported, turning into drops when applicable.

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|bedrock}}, bells deflect any projectile that does not disappear when hitting a surface ([[arrow]]s or [[trident]]s).
* {{IN|bedrock}}, when holding down right-click while looking at a bell and holding an item with a right-click action, the bell rings once and then the player uses the item.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-56968}}</ref>
* {{IN|bedrock}}, If a villager tries to give another villager food near a bell, there is a chance it might hit the bell with the food and cause all the villagers to run, thrower included.
