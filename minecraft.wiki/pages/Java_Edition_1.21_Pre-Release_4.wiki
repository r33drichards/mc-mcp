'''1.21 Pre-Release 4''' (known as '''1.21-pre4''' in the [[launcher]]) is the fourth and final pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.21]], released on June 7, 2024,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-pre-release-4|title=Minecraft 1.21 Pre-Release 4|date=June 7, 2024|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref> which fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Mace]]'''
* Can no longer be enchanted with [[Sharpness]].

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[TNT]]'''
* After a primed TNT has gone through a [[nether portal]], it will no longer be able to destroy [[nether portal block]]s.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* The "Burning Time" reduction effect of [[Fire Protection]] and "Knockback Resistance" effect of [[Blast Protection]] now stack from wearing several pieces.
** Wearing a full set of enchanted armor is needed to get the maximum benefit of these effects.
** This makes wearing a fully enchanted armor set still grant the same effect as in [[1.20.6]].
