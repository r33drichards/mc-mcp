A '''copper axe''' is a variant of [[axe]] crafted from [[copper ingot]]s. It can be used to cut down trees faster, to [[Axe#Stripping and scraping|strip]] [[log]]s and [[scrape]] [[Copper#Blocks|copper-based blocks]], and as a melee weapon that disables [[shields]]. It is the fourth-highest [[tier]] of axe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[stone axe]].

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
Copper axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability. Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.

=== Stripping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a copper axe on a [[log]], [[wood]] block, or [[block of bamboo]] turns it into a [[stripped log]], [[stripped wood]], or [[block of stripped bamboo]], respectively. This uses 1 point of the axe's durability.

=== Scraping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a copper axe on a waxed or oxidized [[copper]] block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise removed a level of oxidization. This uses 1 point of durability.

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
Attacking a [[shield]] user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. [[Vindicator]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, or other [[mob]]s with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a [[sword]] of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]], resulting in lower <abbr title="Damage/Second">DPS</abbr>.

The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.</ref>

==== Unit repair ====
{{Repairing

}}

A copper axe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[copper ingot]], with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two copper axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A copper axe can receive the following enchantments:
