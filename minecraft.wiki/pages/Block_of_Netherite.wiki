A '''block of netherite''', internally known as a '''netherite block''', is a precious [[metal]] block made from nine [[netherite ingot]]s. Unlike most items, it is resistant to [[fire]] and [[lava]], but can still be destroyed by [[cacti]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A block of netherite drops itself if mined with a [[diamond pickaxe]] or better. If mined with any other tool, it drops nothing.

== Usage ==
Blocks of netherite can be used to store [[netherite ingot]]s in a compact fashion.

A single block of netherite contains enough netherite ingots to upgrade a full set of diamond armor and five diamond weapons or tools.

Blocks of netherite have a [[blast resistance]] of 1,200, the same as [[obsidian]], [[crying obsidian]], [[ancient debris]], [[respawn anchor]], [[anvil]]s, and [[enchanting table]]s. Unlike obsidian, blocks of netherite (and ancient debris) can be moved with [[piston]]s, which makes it useful in redstone builds. Furthermore, blocks of netherite have a hardness of 50, the same hardness as [[obsidian]], [[crying obsidian]], and [[respawn anchor]]s. This makes it the hardest block that can be pushed by a piston. However, these blocks can be destroyed by [[explosion]]s while being pushed or pulled by pistons.<ref>{{bug|MC-123217}}</ref> They can also be destroyed by explosions when in item form.<ref>{{bug|MC-212764|||WAI}}</ref>

It can be destroyed by a [[wither]]'s blue skulls and on contact with a wither.

=== Beacons ===
Blocks of netherite can be used to power a [[beacon]]. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of netherite blocks underneath it, and can also optionally include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely netherite blocks, as any combination of [[blocks of iron]], [[blocks of gold]], [[blocks of diamond]], [[blocks of emerald]], or netherite blocks can power a beacon.

== Trivia ==
* A single block of netherite is made from 9 netherite ingots, each composes of 4 netherite scraps and 4 [[gold ingot]]s. Therefore, a block of netherite is made of 36 pieces of [[ancient debris]] and 36 gold ingots.
** To construct a [[beacon]] pyramid consisting entirely of blocks of netherite, a total of 5904 pieces of ancient debris are needed, which is {{frac|92|1|4}} stacks, capable of filling almost three and a half [[shulker box]]es.
