'''1.17 Pre-release 3''' (known as '''1.17-pre3''' in the launcher) is the third pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on June 1, 2021,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-17-pre-release-2|Minecraft 1.17 Pre-Release 3|June 1, 2021}}</ref> which fixed bugs and crashes, as well as tweaking the lit [[candle]] textures.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Candle]]s'''
* Tweaked the textures of lit candles.

'''[[Glow lichen]]'''
* If attached to no sides of a block (by setting all directional [[block state]]s to <code>false</code>), glow lichen now renders as if attached to all sides and no longer emits light.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Goat]]s'''
* Mobs rammed by goats no longer retaliate.

'''[[Axolotl]]s and [[glow squid]]'''
* Now only spawn in total darkness and where there's a block with <code>base_stone_overworld</code> [[tag]] (i.e. stone, deepslate, andesite, diorite, granite or tuff) less than 5 blocks below the spawning space.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Changed the description of the advancement "Wax On" from "Apply Wax to a Copper block!" to "Apply Honeycomb to a Copper block!".
