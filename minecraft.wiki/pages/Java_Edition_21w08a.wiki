'''21w08a''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on February 24, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w08a|February 24, 2021}}</ref> which renames grimstone to [[deepslate]], adds deepslate ores, and makes changes to cave generation.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Cobbled Deepslate.png|32px]] [[Cobbled deepslate]]'''
* Drops from [[deepslate]] when mined with a pickaxe without [[Silk Touch]].
* Functions identically to [[cobblestone]] and [[blackstone]] in that it can be used to craft basic tools, furnaces, and brewing stands.
* Is used to craft all the deepslate variant blocks instead of regular deepslate.
* Has [[wall]], [[stair]], and [[slab]] variants as well.

'''{{Animate|Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore JE3 BE2.png; Deepslate Iron Ore JE2 BE1.png; Deepslate Gold Ore JE2 BE1.png; Deepslate Redstone Ore JE2 BE1.png; Deepslate Diamond Ore JE2 BE1.png|32px}} Deepslate ores'''
* Added deepslate variants of [[Diamond ore|diamond]], [[Iron ore|iron]], [[Gold ore|gold]], [[Lapis lazuli ore|lapis lazuli]], and [[Redstone ore|redstone ores]].
* Take twice as long to mine as normal ores.
* Have the texture of [[deepslate]] replacing the normal stone texture.
* Take place of ores that generate in deepslate.
** Normal stone ores may still generate deep underground if they replace a different block, such as [[tuff]].
* Can be used in blasting and smelting recipes like normal ores.
** These recipes can be unlocked in the recipe book with deepslate ores as well.

'''[[File:Smooth Basalt JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Smooth basalt]]'''
* Generates in place of the tuff layer on [[amethyst geodes]].
* Can be obtained by smelting [[basalt]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Crack carver]]s'''
* Deep, long cracks in the ground that are thinner and straighter than [[canyon]]s.<ref>{{Tweet|henrikkniberg|1364636775298260994|We've also introduced crack carvers, which are like ravines but very narrow and very deep.}}</ref>
* Can reach over 90 blocks in depth.
* They are very similar to canyons {{in|BE}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>deepslate_ore_replaceables</code> block tag.
** Contains deepslate.
* Added the {{cd|diamond_ores|iron_ores|lapis_ores|redstone_ores|d=and}} block and item tags.
** Contain the normal and deepslate variants of each ore type.
* Added the <code>stone_ore_replaceables</code> block tag.
** Contains stone, granite, diorite, andesite, and tuff.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Blackstone]], [[deepslate]], [[polished deepslate]], [[chiseled deepslate]], [[deepslate bricks]], [[deepslate tiles]] and [[stair]], [[slab]] and [[wall]] variants'''
* Textures have been tweaked slightly.

'''[[Gold ore]]'''
* Tweaked texture.
* Is now once again unique from [[nether gold ore]].

'''[[Coal ore]], [[copper ore]], [[emerald ore]], [[iron ore]], [[lapis lazuli ore]], [[redstone ore]]'''
* Tweaked texture.

'''[[Deepslate]]'''
* Renamed from "Grimstone".
* Is no longer used to craft or repair any blocks or items.
* Has new unique breaking, placing, and footstep sounds.
* Can only be mined with a [[Silk Touch]] pickaxe.

'''[[Lava]]'''
* Now replaces air below Y=-55.

'''[[Spore blossom]]s'''
* Particles now appear in the air around the block.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Amethyst geode]]s'''
* Can no longer generate fully in midair.
* The tuff layer has been replaced with smooth basalt.

'''[[Andesite]]'''
* No longer generates below Y=0.

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Tweaked cave sizes.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1364635258260455425|Snapshot time! Mostly cave tweaks. We've increased the cave sizes again, tweaked ore distribution, and renamed Grimstone (among other things). Unfortunately we accidentally messed up iron ore spawning, it is basically missing. Will fix ASAP.|24 Feb 2021}}</ref>
* [[Ravine]]s and regular cave carvers now generate below Y=0.
* Added more variation to carvers.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1364649861761630209|Oh forgot to mention in the changelog: we also added some more variation to the old cave carvers (width, heigh, floor cutoff, etc). Just to make them blend in a bit better with the noise caves instead of being instantly recognizable.|24 Feb 2021}}</ref>
* Caves are now more filled with water.

'''[[Glow lichen]]'''
* Generates almost twice as often.<ref>https://youtu.be/f6o1Bz0cwdI?t=225</ref>

'''[[Lava]]'''
* Once again generates at the bottom of the world starting at Y=-54.
* Lava springs can now generate below Y=0.

'''[[Water]]'''
* Water springs can now generate below Y=0.

[[File:21w08a approximate ore distribution.jpg|thumb|Ore distribution changes.]]
'''[[Mineral]] distribution'''
* Ore distribution has been changed again.
** Iron now generates below Y=0, but in smaller blobs and not as frequently.
*** This was determined to be a bug, which was fixed in snapshot [[21w08b]].
** Gold is a little more common, but with 50% of blocks exposed to air skipped.
** Diamond is the same, but with 50% blocks exposed to air skipped as well.
** Increased frequency of buried lapis.
** Copper is now less common.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Now generate again in the open air in caves.
* No longer appear floating.

'''[[Tuff]]'''
* Now generates in [[ore blob]]s below Y=0.

=== General ===
[[File:Redstone tab 21w08a.png|thumb|Slime and honey blocks in the "Redstone" tab.]]
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* [[Slime block]]s and [[honey block]]s have been moved to the "Redstone" tab.
** The categories of the recipes for these blocks in the [[recipe book]] have moved as well.
* [[Lectern]] position within the "Redstone" tab has been moved out of the "essential" group.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added tuff to the <code>base_stone_overworld</code> block tag.
* Added deepslate gold ore to the <code>gold_ores</code> block and item tags.
