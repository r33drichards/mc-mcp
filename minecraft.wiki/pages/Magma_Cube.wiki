A '''magma cube''' is a [[hostile mob]] found in [[the Nether]]. A magma cube behaves similarly to a [[slime]], but is fireproof, jumps higher and less often, and deals more [[damage]].

== Spawning ==
{{see also|Mob spawn#Spawn cycle}}
Magma cubes spawn in areas of the Nether at all light levels. The space they spawn in must be clear of solid obstructions and liquids. Due to being inherently fireproof, magma cubes can spawn on [[magma block]]s. 

Only sizes 1, 2 and 4 (NBT {{code|Size}} tag values 0, 1 and 3 respectively) spawn naturally. With use of {{command|summon}}, magma cubes can potentially range from size 1 to 127 (NBT <code>Size</code> tag 0–126).{{verify|edition=bedrock|Is there a different maximum size in Bedrock, and if so what is it?}}

[[File:MagmaCubeSpawn.png|thumb|left|This large magma cube attempts to spawn on the [[basalt]], but because there is a piece of [[Iron Bars|iron bar]] intersecting its hitbox, it is unable to spawn. This check is performed before the size of the magma cube is determined, meaning no magma cubes can spawn at that location.]]

A magma cube needs a 2.08×2.08×2.08 free space to spawn. The area in which they spawn must be clear of solid or liquid obstructions. When a magma cube attempts to spawn, the game checks for the space requirement of a large magma cube, and the size is determined later. Therefore, since large magma cubes are slightly taller than 2 blocks, no magma cubes, regardless of size, are able to spawn at all in 2-block-high areas. Also, since large magma cubes are slightly wider than 2 blocks, and mobs spawn at the center of a block, having any block within the 2.08×2.08×2.08 area, even as thin as a [[glass pane]], can prevent a magma cube of any size from spawning.

Magma cubes' size is affected by [[regional difficulty]]: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Nether Wastes ===
Magma cubes spawn uncommonly in [[Nether wastes]] in groups of 4 {{In|Java}} and 1 to 4 {{In|Bedrock}}.

=== Nether Fortresses ===
Magma cubes spawn commonly in [[Nether fortress]]es in groups of 4 {{In|Java}} and groups of 2-3 {{In|Bedrock}}.

=== Basalt Deltas ===
Magma cubes spawn commonly in [[basalt deltas]], in groups of 2 to 5. They are also notably most dangerous in this biome, thanks to their knockback capabilities and the biome's many thin bridges between lava lakes.

=== Monster spawners ===
Magma cube [[monster spawner]]s generate in the treasure room of [[bastion remnant]]s.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Magma Cube jumping.gif|thumb|right|upright|Magma cube jumping.]]
A magma cube seeks out any [[player]] or an [[iron golem]] within a spherical distance of 16 blocks. If it finds no enemy, it changes direction every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds) and jumps forward every 40 to 120 ticks (2 to 6 seconds). If it finds a target, the delay before jumping is {{fraction|1|3}} as long (13 to 40 ticks), and the magma cube changes direction directly toward the target before jumping.

Magma cubes cannot be hurt by fall damage or burning, and are not slowed down by lava. They can swim upward in lava and leap above its surface. 

Their jump height depends on their size (6 high for large). Their forward speed is twice that of most other mobs. They always make a distinct sound upon jumping up and landing, but no idle sounds.

When a magma cube is killed, it splits into 2-4 smaller magma cubes. Tiny magma cubes disappear when killed, like other mobs.

They can swim in water and attempt to stay on the surface. Like [[slime]]s, magma cubes starts taking [[drowning]] damage if submerged in water for 15 seconds, splitting into smaller cubes if possible.

Magma cubes take extra damage from [[powder snow]], taking {{hp|5}} every two seconds, unlike {{hp|1}} for other mobs.

Unlike most mobs, magma cubes have no pathfinding ability, meaning that they do not avoid falling off cliffs and cannot go around walls, even when chasing a player. This behavior is shared by slimes.

When they are in lava, they hover and try to move to nearby land.

The eyes and yellow core of magma cubes are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]].

=== Combat ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Combat#Magma cubes}}
Magma cubes attack by jumping and attempting to land on the player, and cause damage when touched anywhere. As their jump rate is random, magma cubes can be hard to fight.

The health of a magma cube is its size squared; the attack strength is its size + 2, and the armor points are its size tripled.

A magma cube jumps a distance of approximately its length times 1.5 and a height equivalent to its size in blocks. This means that a large magma cube jumps 4 blocks in height and moves significantly quicker than a small magma cube, which jumps 2 blocks in height; while a tiny magma cube moves slowly and jumps 1 block in height.

Magma cubes continuously damage all players and iron golems they collide with (although [[damage immunity]] reduces the actual damage to 1 attack every half second), equivalent to about twice as often as other mobs.  Despite other mobs only damaging targets they specifically attack.<ref>{{bug|MC-131426||Big Slimes have little to no Attack Cooldown (compared to other mobs)}}</ref> This means that a large magma cube deals {{hp|12}} of damage per second on normal difficulty. Unlike [[slime]]s, tiny magma cubes can deal damage to the player.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* When a larger magma cube that has a name dies, the smaller magma cubes it spawns also have the same name, just like [[slime]]s.
* According to a minecraft.net article, magma cubes don't actually attack the player like other mobs, but instead, their heat is dangerous when close.<ref>{{Mcnet|visit-nether-|Visit the Nether!|October 11, 2019|Duncam Geere}}</ref>
* Magma cube is the only mob native to the Nether that can truly swim in water.
** Zombified piglins, skeletons, and wither skeletons sink in water.
** Piglins, piglin brutes and hoglins sink in water and drown.
** Endermen, blazes, and striders take damage in water immediately.
