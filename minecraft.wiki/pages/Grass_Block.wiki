A '''grass block''' is a natural [[block]] that generates abundantly across the surface of the [[Overworld]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A grass block can be obtained by mining it using a [[tool]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. Otherwise, it drops [[dirt]]. 

The snowy grass variant cannot be obtained as an item, even with the use of [[Silk Touch]]. It can only be obtained through [[add-on]]s{{only|be}} or inventory editing.{{verify|edition=java}}

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Grass Block|drop=0|shovel}}

=== Natural generation ===
Grass blocks generate naturally in most [[biome]]s in the [[Overworld]], and as part of [[village]]s and [[ancient cities]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Endermen]] can pick up grass blocks, and drop the blocks they are holding if killed, making it the only way to obtain grass blocks without the use of [[Silk Touch]].

=== Post-generation ===
[[File:Grass Spread Diagram.png|thumb|width=237x237|An in-game diagram of a grass block's spreading range]]
Grass can spread to nearby [[dirt]] blocks, but not [[coarse dirt]] or [[rooted dirt]]. Grass spreading without player intervention depends heavily on the [[Daylight cycle|time of day]]. For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met:
# The dirt block receiving grass must be within a 3×5×3 range of the source grass block where the source block is in the center of the second topmost layer of that range.
# The source grass block must have a [[light]] level of 9 or brighter directly above it.
# The block directly above the dirt block must allow light to pass through it and hit the dirt block, even though the actual light level does not matter. That means blocks that partially let light through such as stairs and slabs must not have their light-blocking side(s){{only|java}} facing the dirt block.
# The block directly above the dirt block must not be [[lava]], [[water]], or a waterlogged variant of a block.
When grass is [[random tick]]ed, it spreads by checking 4 blocks within range and converts any dirt blocks selected into grass.

Though [[water]] and [[lava]] are both [[Light#Light-filtering_blocks|light-filtering blocks]] (meaning they decrease skylight by 1 level but do not affect block light), other light-filtering blocks such as [[ice]] and [[slime block]]s do not block grass from spreading to the dirt block. Grass blocks can grow under all other transparent blocks like [[glass]], [[fence]]s, or [[torch]]es. Grass jumps directly from one block to a neighbor and is not affected by gaps or other blocks being "in the way." Grass blocks spread at random intervals and have an equal chance of spreading to any suitable dirt blocks that are in range. Because grass can spread as much as 3 levels downward, it tends to spread down slopes much faster than it spreads up them.

== Appearance ==
[[File:JFgrass.png|thumb|[[Plains]] (left) and [[forest]] (right) grass colors.]]

The [[Block colors|coloration]] of grass blocks is dependent on the [[biome]] they are in. A grass block always uses the color set to its location, regardless of how it was placed or of its source. This affects the side and top of the block.

{{IN|BE}}, biome colors also appear on [[map]]s.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|130658|Grass/foliage colors on maps still use the colors from Alpha v1.1.2_01 and earlier / do not change color with biomes|June 2, 2018}}</ref>

=== Color ===
==== Item ====
* {{IN|Java}}, {{InvSprite|Grass Block}} an item of grass block uses biome color with temperature 0.5, downfall 1.0, and as a result is colored {{color|#7cbd6b}}. {{IN|BE}}, this color is coded in the item's texture.

==== Biome colors ====
These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm, which depends on the biome's temperature and downfall. See [[biome colors]] for more information.

== Usage ==
Using [[bone meal]] on grass blocks causes [[short grass]], [[tall grass]],{{only|java}} [[fern]]s,{{only|bedrock}} and [[flower]]s to grow.

[[Passive mob]]s tend to wander toward grass blocks. They also wander toward [[light]].

When a [[sheep]] eats a grass block, the block becomes [[dirt]], and a [[shear]]ed sheep regrows its [[wool]]. Baby sheep graze grass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

Tilling a grass block with a [[hoe]] converts it to a [[farmland]] block. 

[[Dirt path]]s can be created by {{Control|using}} any type of [[shovel]] on the side or top of a grass block with air above it. The shovel loses 1 durability for each dirt path block created.

=== Death ===
Grass dies and changes to [[dirt]] a random time (when a [[random tick]] lands on the block) after it has been covered by any [[opaque]] blocks. Transparent blocks can kill grass in a similar manner if they cause the light level above the grass block to be four or below (like water does) and the surrounding area is not otherwise sufficiently illuminated.

=== Spawning ===
{{IN|Java}}, [[animal]]s occasionally [[Mob spawning|spawn]] on grass blocks that have light level 9 or brighter in the space directly above. This is quite rare and requires that there be few other animals nearby or in the spawn chunks. Most animals are instead created along with the terrain.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, most animals require surface grass blocks (grass blocks with no solid block anywhere above them at the same x, z coordinate) to spawn. Animals regularly spawn in most Overworld biomes on surface grass blocks that have light level 7 or brighter in the space directly above.

=== Snowy grass block ===
[[File:Snowy Grass Block.png|150px|thumb|A snowy grass block with snow on top of it.]]

Grass blocks turn into a snowy grass block if [[snow]], [[powder snow]], or a [[snow block]] is placed on top of the block. Removing the snow layer turns the block into a normal grass block.

{{IN|je}}, the top face of snowy grass blocks is not affected by biome tinting and defaults to gray, which is not normally seen by players because of the snow layer on top. {{IN|bedrock}}, the top face of snowy grass blocks is affected by biome tinting and can be seen in-game when inside [[powder snow]] placed on grass blocks.

=== Composting ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, placing grass blocks into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-140266}}</ref>
