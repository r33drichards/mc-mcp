A '''rose bush''' is a tall [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[red dye]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A rose bush can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A rose bush also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Rose Bush|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===

Rose bushes generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[forest]], [[flower forest]], [[birch forest]], [[old growth birch forest]], and [[dark forest]] biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a rose bush, the flower drops a copy of itself.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, rose bushes can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Like other tall flowers, rose bushes cannot be placed inside [[flower pot]]s. 

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with rose bushes, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Rose bushes can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a rose bush have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a rose bush into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of rose bushes yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
