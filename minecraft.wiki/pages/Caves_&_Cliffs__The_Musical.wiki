'''Caves & Cliffs: The Musical''' is a musical short centered around new features added during the [[Caves & Cliffs]] update, initially released during [[Minecraft Live 2021]]. The video revolves around [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] being taught about then-new additions, told to them by song, while various things interrupt the sequence.

== Summary ==
Steve and Alex are meeting up in a village, when they're suddenly approached by a non-corporeal [[Singing Narrator|voice]], asking if they've discovered everything in part one of the Caves & Cliffs update. They shrug, triggering an earthquake. They fall into a display of many new features, including [[candle]]s, [[glow lichen]]s, and [[amethyst geode]]s. While Alex is mining [[Amethyst Shard|amethyst]], she's interrupted by a [[screaming goat]]. The song continues, stressing those are only a fraction of the new features, listing off [[dripleaves]], more options for [[dirt path]]s, [[powder snow]], [[copper ore]], [[raw ore]], and [[lightning rod]]s. After announcing that last feature, a [[wandering trader]] is electrocuted.

The song moves on to explain [[oxidation]] and the use of [[honeycombs]] to wax them. The song then establishes [[blocks of raw copper]], but Steve notices a goat and expects it to scream. It doesn't, but a second goat next to them does. The song then introduces [[axolotls]], and them being [[Bucket of Axolotl|compatible]] with [[buckets]], before moving onto [[glow squids]] and their ambience, as well as their [[Glow Ink Sac|ink]] being usable on [[signs]] and [[item frames]]. The song then mentions [[dripstone cave]]s and [[deepslate ore]]s. As Steve and Alex climb up a [[mountain]], the song concludes by stressing more content is being added, before a goat screams again.

== Lyrics ==
'''Narrator''' ''(to Steve and Alex)'': Hey, you two, have you discovered all the features in part one of the Caves and Cliffs update?

'''Narrator''': Well... There's brand new COLORED CANDLES and the LICHEN makes rocks glow. You'll find some AMETHYST if you look inside a GEODE.

The BUDS grow into CLUSTERS then you get SHARDS when they're mined! These are just a few of all the things there are to find! Like: 

Jump across some DRIPLEAVES! Make DIRTPATHS from these! Spending too much time in POWDER SNOW will make you freeze!

You can mine RAW COPPER, smelt some INGOTS into BLOCKS. A LIGHTNING ROD in THUNDERSTORMS will stop you getting SHOCKED!

COPPER oxidizes but to stop it, make it WAXED. Craft your RAW ORES inro RAW BLOCKS if you've got too many STACKS.

You can find AXOLOTLS in the water underground. Put them in your BUCKET you can carry them around!

There's GLOW SQUIDS way down here. They fill their caves with light! Make a SIGN using their INK! Make a GLOW FRAME super bright!

There's DRIPSTONE blocks and DEEPSLATE versions of the ORES! There's so many things here to explore and there's so much MORE!
