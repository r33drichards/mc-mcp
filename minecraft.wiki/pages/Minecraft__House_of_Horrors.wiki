== Synopsis ==

[[Amy]] is pretty happy living the quiet life at home. She can mine ore, read up on oceanography, hang out with her pet fox. What’s not to love? Her brother, on the other hand...

[[Marc]] is always leaving their village to look for excitement. But when a couple of weeks go by without any word from him, Amy can’t help but worry. Digging around, she discovers Marc has gone off alone in search of someplace called [[Glory’s Haven]], a house deep in the forests where (supposedly) the greatest adventurer their town has ever seen stashed a ton of loot. With nobody else to turn to, Amy decides to mount a solo rescue mission for her lost brother. She and Marc explored together all the time when they were little. How hard could it be to find him now?

Turns out—it’s pretty hard. After facing [[spiders]], [[zombies]], a roving band of [[illagers]], and some deceptively difficult [[cows]], Amy is beginning to realize that something is seriously off with Glory’s Haven. Like why does this house seem to go on forever? And where did all these mobs come from? Amy will have to unravel these mysteries—and fast—if she hopes to find her brother and escape the spooky house unscathed. Whether she likes it or not, she’s in for the adventure of a lifetime!<ref name=MCHouseHorror/>
