'''World preset''' is used to determine what dimensions a new world will have, which can be customized by a [[data pack]]. When [[Create New World|creating a new world]], on the "World" tab, it is possible to choose which world preset to use, or not use any world preset.

== Usage ==
When opening the "World" tab for the first time, the "World Type" button is displayed as "Default" which means that at the moment the new world does '''not''' use any world preset, but uses three vanilla dimensions by default, and it also tries to read the dimension files from the <code>dimension</code> folder of the data pack. Note that a data pack can modify these three vanilla dimensions or add new dimensions with the dimension files, but cannot delete the vanilla dimensions.

Once the player clicks the "World Type" button, the game will use the world preset to determine the dimensions of the new world, no longer using the <code>dimension</code> folder. Changing the button back to "Default" will use the {{cd|minecraft:normal}} world preset, instead of the original default state. However, without the data pack, the default state is exactly the same as the "Default" preset ({{cd|minecraft:normal}}).

The game also does not use world presets if [[custom]] world settings are imported.

| {{anchor|Default}}{{EnvSprite|default}} '''Default'''
| Various landscapes in the [[Overworld]] are generated with [[biome]]s.

|-
| {{anchor|Superflat|Flat}}{{EnvSprite|superflat}} '''[[Superflat]]'''
| This world preset makes the Overworld completely flat. By default, the terrain consists of one layer of [[bedrock]], two layers of [[dirt]] and one layer of [[grass]]; the surface is therefore at Y=-60. [[Mob]]s spawn normally; [[slime]]s are prevalent.

It can be further customized through the "Superflat World Customization" screen and [[custom world preset#Superflat level generation preset|superflat level generation preset]], which allow the [[player]] to change terrain layers, spawn [[tree]]s, and generate larger [[village]]s, [[stronghold]]s, etc.

| {{anchor|AMPLIFIED|Amplified}}{{EnvSprite|amplified}}<br>'''[[Amplified]]'''
| The Overworld dimension generates many large mountains that dwarf even the [[mountains]] biomes seen in default world types and often reach the world height limit. Due to extremely steep cliffs and unforgiving terrain, careless players may have difficulty surviving. Certain biomes (i.e. [[ocean]]s and [[river]]s) may see no obvious change in height. [[Village]]s still spawn in this world type regardless of how flat the ground is, causing the buildings to generate in bizarre ways.

|-
| {{anchor|Large Biomes}}{{EnvSprite|large biomes}} '''[[Large biomes]]'''
| The size of the biomes in the Overworld is roughly 4x larger along the X and Z axes, which results in [[biome]]s with 16 times as much area.

|-
| {{anchor|Single Biome}}{{EnvSprite|biomes}} '''[[Single biome]]'''
| There is only one biome in the Overworld. This biome defaults to [[Plains]] and can be selected by the player at the time of world creation.

|-
| {{anchor|Debug Mode}}{{EnvSprite|debug mode}} '''[[Debug mode]]'''
| A world preset containing all of the block states laid out in a grid at layer y=70 for convenient viewing. It can be accessed by holding down the {{key|ALT}} key while cycling through the world types.<br>
In this world type, there is a floor on y=60 made of barriers and the [[player]] cannot place or destroy blocks.
