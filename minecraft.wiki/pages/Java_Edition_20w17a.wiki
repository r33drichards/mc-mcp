'''20w17a''' is the thirteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on April 22, 2020,<ref name="20w17a">{{snap|20w17a|April 22, 2020}}</ref> which added the {{cmd|attribute}} command, tweaked [[bastion remnant]] loot, and lowered the spawn rate of [[ruined portal]]s, along with bug fixes.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[Commands]]'''
* Added the {{cmd|attribute}} command.
** Used to get, set, or modify [[attribute]]s.
** Syntax:
*** <code>attribute <''target''> <''attribute''> get [<''scale''>]</code>: get total value of attribute
*** <code>attribute <''target''> <''attribute''> base set <''value''></code>: sets base value
*** <code>attribute <''target''> <''attribute''> base get [<''scale''>]</code>: get base value
*** <code>attribute <''target''> <''attribute''> modifier add <''uuid''> <''name''> <''value''> (add|multiply|multiply_base)</code>: adds modifier (fails if modifier is already present)
*** <code>attribute <''target''> <''attribute''> modifier remove <''uuid''></code>: removes modifier
*** <code>attribute <''target''> <''attribute''> modifier value get <''uuid''> [<''scale''>]</code>: get value of modifier
**Parameters:
*** <code><''target''></code>: single entity (note: only players, armor stands and mobs have attributes)
*** <code><''attribute''></code>: name of attribute (like <code>minecraft:generic.max_health</code>)
*** <code><''name''></code>: string (in optional quotes) describing human-readable name of modifier
*** <code><''value''></code>: floating point value (note: certain attributes have limits on final value, so the change might not be noticeable)

=== General ===
'''Options'''
* Added an "Entity Distance" scale option ranging from 50% to 500%.
** Sets the distance at which [[mob]]s render into frame.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>pressure_plates</code> block tag.
** Contains light and heavy weighted pressure plates, as well as the <code>[[Tag#blocks wooden_pressure_plates|#wooden_pressure_plates]]</code> and <code>[[Tag#blocks stone_pressure_plates|#stone_pressure_plates]]</code> block tags.
* Added <code>stone_pressure_plates</code> block tag.
** Contains stone and polished blackstone pressure plates.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Added new sounds for [[Iron Chain|chain]]s.

'''World creation'''
* [[Difficulty]] and [[game rule]]s can now be changed from the "Create World" screen.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* Breaking a furnace now gives the experience for the smelted things inside.

'''[[Gilded blackstone]] and [[Nether gold ore]]'''
* Now use the same sounds as [[Nether quartz ore]].

'''[[Smithing table]]s'''
[[File:SmithingTableUI-20w17.png|thumb|The new smithing table UI]]
* Improved UI.
** Added an ingot outline to the second input slot.
** Added a hammer icon above the input slots, similar to the anvil UI.

'''[[Soul fire lantern]]s and [[soul fire torch]]es'''
* Renamed "Soul Fire Lantern" and "Soul Fire Torch" to "Soul Lantern" and "Soul Torch", respectively.
* IDs have been changed from <code>soul_fire_torch</code> and <code>soul_fire_lantern</code> to <code>soul_torch</code> and <code>soul_lantern</code>, respectively.

'''[[Wall]]s'''
* Now change into posts when [[pressure plate]]s and [[banner]]s are placed on them.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Bastion remnant]]s'''
* Loot has been tweaked.
** Ancient debris and netherite scraps have been made generally rarer.
** Netherite gear can no longer be found in bastion remnants; instead, diamond gear is found.
** The chances and stack sizes of various items have been tweaked.

'''[[Ruined portal]]s'''
* Now spawn about 30% less frequently.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Creative inventory'''
* Inventory tab names, which appear in the description of items when in the Search tab, now display in boldface.
** Other information, such as tag names, are now displayed in boldface as well.
* Netherite ingots and netherite scrap have been moved next to iron and gold ingots.

=== General ===
'''Block storage format'''
* Format in chunks has been slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc.).
** <code>BlockStates</code> in <code>Sections</code> elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields.
*** If the number of bits per block is not the power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill the whole number of blockstates) some bits aren't used.
*** For example, if a single block state takes 5 bits, the highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field are unused. That also means a slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

'''Fonts'''
* Chat component style now supports <code>font</code> property, which is a resource location for the font in the resource pack. No entry is equivalent to <code>minecraft:default</code>.
* Full range of Unicode characters is supported, making it possible to type emojis and other Unicode characters outside of the [[wikipedia:Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]].
** However, custom resource packs must be used to display correct characters instead of tofu, due to the lack of these characters in the default font.
* <code>Force Unicode</code> option now switches between normal and alternative font (called <code>uniform.json</code>) - no reload needed.

'''[[Main menu]]'''
* The "Singleplayer" button jumps directly to the "Create World" screen if there are no worlds to select.

'''[[Raw JSON text format]]'''
* The JSON <code>color</code> component now supports 6-digit hexadecimal colors to specify custom colors other than the 16 default [[color codes]].
** Example: <code>/tellraw @a {"text":"Turquoise output","color":"#00ff88"}</code>
* The <code>hoverEvent</code> chat component now uses the parameter <code>contents</code>, with contents depending on type:
** For <code>show_text</code> - chat component
** For <code>show_item</code> - either item id or object with fields <code>id</code>, <code>count</code> and <code>tag</code> (with last one being serialized NBT)
** For <code>show_entity</code> - object with fields: <code>id</code> (UUID), <code>name</code> (chat component) and <code>type</code> (entity type resource location)
** The <code>value</code> argument is now deprecated, but still supported.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Changed the <code>wall_post_override</code> block tag to include the <code>banners</code> and <code>pressure_plates</code> block tags.

'''UI'''
* Changed checkbox texture.

'''World save format'''
* Saving <code>level.dat</code> now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using <code>level.dat_new</code> every time).
* <code>player/*.dat</code> are now saved in a way similar to <code>level.dat</code> (including leaving <code>.dat_old</code> files).
