'''Glowstone''' is a light-emitting [[block]] found hanging from ceilings and overhangs in [[the Nether]]. It can be used as a [[crafting]] material, broken into [[Glowstone Dust|glowstone dust]], and is required to fuel [[Respawn Anchor|respawn anchors]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Fortune#Discrete random}}
If glowstone is broken using a [[tool]] with [[Silk Touch]], the block drops itself. When a glowstone block is broken using any other tool, it drops 2–4 [[glowstone dust]]. If a tool with [[Fortune]] is used, it has a higher chance of dropping a large amount of glowstone dust—but never more than 4.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|drop=0|Glowstone}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:GlowstoneInNether.png|thumb|420px|A naturally occurring blob of glowstone in the underside of netherrack.]]

Glowstone only occurs naturally in [[the Nether]], where it generates in [[Glowstone blob|crystalline blobs]] on the underside of ceilings or overhangs. They can be found in every Nether biome, although they are significantly rarer in [[soul sand valley]]s,<ref>{{bug|MC-171520||Glowstone clusters cannot generate in Soul Sand Valley biomes|WAI}}</ref> because the ceiling of this biome is made of [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]] below which glowstone blobs cannot generate. They can still occasionally generate in caves and canyons in this biome,<ref>{{bug|MC-192936||Glowstone clusters generate on netherrack in Soul Sand Valley|WAI}}</ref> because the ceiling is made of [[netherrack]].

Glowstone can also generate as a part of hoglin stable [[bastion remnant]]s.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Witch]]es may drop [[glowstone dust]], which can be crafted into glowstone.

=== Trading ===
Journeyman [[Cleric]]s always sell one glowstone for 4 [[emerald]]s, and [[wandering trader]]s occasionally sell one glowstone for 2 emeralds.

== Usage ==
=== Light source ===
Glowstone blocks emit a light level of 15, the brightest possible light level in the game. They emit the same amount of light as [[sea lantern]]s and [[jack o'lantern]]s.

=== Redstone circuits ===
{{Schematic|caption=A glowstone block can transmit power up, but not down. Lamp '''A''' is powered because the redstone signal travels up the glowstone block. Lamp '''B''' is off as the signal would have to go down the glowstone, which is not possible.

When placing [[redstone dust]] on a glowstone block, being a transparent block, signals can pass from one block to another diagonally. Redstone wire, even though it may appear to connect up the side of a glowstone block and to the wire portion on top, does not send a redstone signal down the glowstone block. This makes glowstone effective for vertical diodes, logic gate designs, and space-efficient instant vertical redstone.

Note that upside-down [[slab]]s can be used for the same purpose, and are easier to obtain.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Glowstone, like other pushable blocks, becomes a block of [[moving piston]] when moved by a [[piston]]; this momentarily stops it from giving off light.<ref>{{bug|MC-123217||Moving blocks don't inherit behaviors of the block they hold}}</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Note blocks ===
Glowstone can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce pling sounds.

=== Respawn anchors ===
Glowstone is used to charge [[respawn anchor]]s.

If a [[dispenser]] containing glowstone is facing a respawn anchor, it can automatically charge the respawn anchor when powered.

=== Transparent block ===
[[File:GlowstonePathfind.png|thumb|Mobs, in this case [[blaze]]s, are able to choose glowstone blocks as their pathfinding target, as if they are normal solid blocks.]]

Glowstone blocks all sunlight, players and mobs suffocate inside it, mobs are able to pathfind to it, and it blocks a [[beacon]] beam, preventing the beacon's activation. However, like transparent blocks, it does not prevent the opening of chests, monsters (including [[slime]]s) cannot spawn on it,{{Only|je}} and it does not transfer a redstone signal. This behavior also occurs in [[sea lantern]]s.

== Trivia ==
* Rarely, glowstone can be found touching the ground if the ceiling it was generated on was extremely low (2&ndash;3 blocks of clearance).
* Analyzing glowstone in a [[material reducer]], it turns out to be a 1:1:1:1:1 mixture of argon, neon and krypton noble gases, boron and an unknown [[element]].{{only|be|ee}}
