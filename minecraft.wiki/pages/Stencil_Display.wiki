'''Stencil Displays''' are [[Entity|entities]] exclusive to the April Fools' snapshot [[Java Edition 23w13a or b|23w13a_or_b]]. They can only be created with the {{cmd|summon}} command. 

== Usage ==
It is unknown what the use of the entity is, if any at all.

== Appearance ==
Appears solid white, and is unaffected by lighting.

The Stencil Display appears as a flat surface unless intersecting with a block, if it intersects with a block, it attempts to wrap itself to the surface.

;Level of Detail
Stencil Display has a data tag called {{code|lod}} that affects how it appears. It is set to 0 by default, but can be modified using commands. Starting off as a square at {{code|lod}} 0, and becoming a higher quality circle as the {{code|lod}} value increases, seeming to stop at 4, although the value can still be set higher.

It also affects the color of the block outline when covering part of a block.

;Shape
Stencil Display has a data tag called {{code|shaoe}} that affects how the gemotry is made up. It is set to 0 by default, making it start as a square. It can be modified using commands. Setting {{code|shaoe}} to 1 will make it start off a a triangle, and each level of {{code|lod}} adds 1 more triangle.

;Color
Stencil Display has a data tag called {{code|color}}, this differs from other Decimal color fields as it also deals with transparency of the stencil too.
