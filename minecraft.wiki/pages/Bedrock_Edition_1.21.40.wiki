* A variant of [[Survival]] mode in which the world is locked to [[Hard]] difficulty.
* Players cannot respawn after dying, but can continue to observe the world as a [[spectator]].

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Bundle_JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Bundle]]'''
* An item that can hold a mixed stack of up to 64 items.
* Crafted from a [[string]] and a piece of [[leather]].
{{Crafting Table

|Output = Bundle
}}
* Can be dyed into 16 colors.
{{Crafting Table

}}
* Items that stack up to 16 take up more space, while items that do not stack take up the entire bundle (except other bundles).
** [[Shulker box]]es cannot be placed in bundles.
** Bundles can be placed in other bundles; this takes up 4 slots plus the number of slots already used by the inner bundle.
* Has a tooltip that shows the items inside.
** If a bundle has less than 8 item types inside, the tooltip shows all of them.
** Otherwise the tooltip shows the top 3 rows of items and the others are hidden below, always showing at least 12 item types.
*They have been de-experimentified and are now available during normal gameplay.
*When a Bundle is used in the hotbar, one group of items is emptied at a time instead of everything being emptied at once.
*Bundle icon now matches {{JE}}.
* When selecting an item to remove, the Bundle icon shows that item poking out of the Bundle.
* When holding a bundle in hand, the player can empty it onto the ground by right-clicking.
* It is possible to select any of the visible items to pull out of the Bundle.
** Right-clicking takes the first item.
** Using the scroll wheel to select a different item, then right-click to take it.
* When a bundle is used in the hotbar, one group of items is emptied at a time.

== Changes ==

*Added specific effect removal option to the command:
** {{cmd|/effect <player: target> clear <effect: Effect>}}

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
*Items and blocks in the creative inventory have been reorganized, with the goal of making overall sorting more intuitive:

***[[Chiseled nether bricks]] and [[cracked nether bricks]] were moved next to the [[nether bricks block]] and [[red nether bricks]].
***[[Quartz bricks]] placed next to the other quartz blocks.
***[[Rooted dirt]] is now next to the other dirt blocks.
***Many dirt blocks and grass variants were shuffled around for a greater parity with {{JE}}.
***[[Gravel]] is now ordered after the "Stone" group and is next to sand and red sand.
***[[Clay]] was moved from the "Construction" category to the "Nature" category, placed next to the mud block.

=== General ===

**As a result, bats may now happen to spawn above the surface.

=== Technical ===
'''[[API]]'''
*{{cd|BlockLiquidContainerComponents}} API (water, lava, potion, snow) has been replaced with {{cd|BlockFluidContainerComponent}}.
*Moved {{cd|isHardcore}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.15.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|getRedstonePower}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.15.0}}.

'''[[Behavior Pack]]s'''
*Updated references to old block names in behavior pack wood recipe files.
*Updated references to old block names in remaining behavior pack recipe files.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Added content warning when {{cd|carried_textures}} or {{cd|blockshape}} are incorrectly written in {{cd|blocks.json}}.
*Updated the jigsaw block:
**Updated the jigsaw block UI.
**Added selection priority and placement priority fields.
*Updated references to old block names in behavior pack color recipe files.
*Updated references to old block names in behavior pack feature files.
*Updated references to old block names in biome definition files.

'''[[Commands/camera|Camera]]'''
*The {{cd|minecraft:follow_orbit}} preset is no longer behind the experimental toggle.

'''[[Commands]]'''
*Added new overloads for the {{cmd|/schedule}} command which allows you to clear a queued function:
**{{cmd|/schedule clear <function name>}} - Clears all queued functions matching the given name.
**{{cmd|/schedule on_area_loaded clear function <function name>}} - Clears all queued functions that are scheduled as {{cd|on_area_load}} by name.
**{{cmd|/schedule on_area_loaded clear tickingarea <tickingarea name> [function name]}} - Clears all queued functions that are scheduled as {{cd|on_area_load}} by ticking area name (and optionally also checks function name too).

'''Components'''
*The {{cd|restriction_type}} field has been added to the {{cd|minecraft:home}} component, allowing to define how an entity is restricted to its home position:
**Its values are:
***{{cd|none}}, which poses no restriction.
***{{cd|random_movement}}, which restricts randomized movement around the home position.
***{{cd|all_movement}}, which restricts any kind of movement around the home position.
**The {{cd|all_movement}} value is currently in {{cd|[Beta]}} and is planned to be fully released at a later date.
**Entities that have moved too far from their home can always move closer to it if prompted.
**The radius of the restriction is still specified with {{cd|restriction_radius}}.
**Entities with a format version prior to {{cd|1.21.40}} use the new field in a way that preserves their existing behavior.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:dimension_bound}} component, which prevents entities from changing dimension through portals.
**In Vanilla content, this is used by the Ender Dragon, the fishing hook, and some projectiles.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:transient}} component, entities with this component are never saved. In Vanilla content, this is currently used for the fishing hook.
*Renamed the {{cd|minecraft:lookat}} component to {{cd|minecraft:looked_at}} to better reflect its functionality:
**Its {{cd|look_event}} field was also renamed to {{cd|looked_at_event}}.
**Its {{cd|look_cooldown}} field was also renamed to {{cd|looked_at_cooldown}}.
*Expanded the {{cd|minecraft:looked_at}} component functionality with the addition of six new [Beta] fields: 
**{{cd|find_players_only}} restricts the search for entities looking at the owner entity to players only, ensuring that the closest player satisfying the specified {{cd|filters}} is selected.
**{{cd|look_at_locations}} defines the parts of the owner entity that are targeted for being looked at:
***For these parts, a line-of-sight check is performed to ensure no blocks obstruct the view.
***Supported values are {{cd|head}}, {{cd|body}}, and {{cd|feet}}.
**{{cd|not_looked_at_event}} specifies the event to trigger when no suitable entity is looking at the owner entity.
**{{cd|field_of_view}} defines the width of the field of view, in degrees, for entities looking at the owner entity:
***If {{cd|scale_fov_by_distance}} is set to true, this value corresponds to the field of view at a distance of one block between the entities.
**{{cd|scale_fov_by_distance}} determines if the field of view narrows as the distance between the owner entity and the entity looking at it increases.
***This ensures that the width of the view cone at the owner entity position remains relatively constant, regardless of distance.
**{{cd|line_of_sight_obstruction_type}} defines which block shape is considered when checking for line-of-sight obstructions.
***Supported values are {{cd|outline}}, {{cd|collision}}, and {{cd|collision_for_camera}}.
**Moreover, {{cd|et_target}} now supports three different values:
***{{cd|never}}, looking entities are never set as targets, but events are emitted.
***{{cd|once_and_stop_scanning}}, the first detected looking entity is set as target, but scanning and event emission is suspended if and until the owner entity has a target.
***[Beta] {{cd|once_and_keep_scanning}}, the first detected looking entity is set as target, but scanning and event emission continues.
**All these fields are planned to be taken out of [Beta] and fully released at a later date.
*Moved the {{cd|minecraft:redstone_conductivity}} component out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment for {{cd|format_versions}} {{cd|1.21.30}} and above.
*The {{cd|minecraft:damage_sensor}} component's {{cd|deals_damage}} field now supports three values:
**{{cd|yes}}, received damage is applied to the entity.
**{{cd|no}}, received damage is not applied to the entity.
**{{cd|no_but_side_effects_apply}}, received damage is not applied to the entity, but the side effects of the attack are.
***This means that the attacker's weapon loses durability, enchantment side effects are applied, etc.
**Pre-existing content are automatically updated to maintain its original behavior.
*Removed support for the {{cd|allow_invulnerable}} field from the {{cd|minecraft:looked_at component}}.
**This field never had any functionality, so this change won't affect pre-existing or future content in any way.
**The field is ignored for any content with a format version lower than 1.21.40.
**A content error is emitted for any content with a format version equal to or higher than 1.21.40 that still uses this field.

'''Entity Components'''
*{{cd|behavior.fire_at_target}} is no longer usable if it is missing a projectile definition and throws a content error if so.
*Expanded {{cd|minecraft:explode}} with the following new fields:
**{{cd|damage_scaling}}: A scale factor applied to the explosion's damage to entities. A value of 0 prevents the explosion from dealing any damage. Negative values cause the explosion to heal entities instead:
**{{cd|toggles_blocks}}: If true, the explosion toggles blocks in the explosion radius.
**{{cd|knockback_scaling}}: A scale factor applied to the knockback force caused by the explosion.
**{{cd|particle_effect}}: The name of the particle effect to use. The accepted strings are {{cd|wind_burst}} or {{cd|breeze_wind_burst}}. All other inputs use the default explosion particles.
**{{cd|sound_effect}}: The name of the sound effect played when the explosion triggers.
**{{cd|negates_fall_damage}}: Defines whether the explosion should apply fall damage negation to players above the point of collision.
**{{cd|allow_underwater}}: If true, the explosion affects blocks and entities underwater.

'''Entity Event Responses'''
*Added the {{cd|execute_event_on_home_block}} entity event response, which allows the entity to execute an event on the block at its home position:
**The {{cd|event}} field allows to specify the event to execute.
**For this to work properly, the entity must have a {{cd|minecraft:home}} component with a set home position.
*Added the {{cd|reset_target}} entity event response, which allows an entity to reset its target.

'''[[Feature]]'''
*Using unsupported feature placement in {{cd|pregeneration_pass}} throws a content error instead of crash.

'''General'''
*Made the following changes to {{cd|minecraft:single_block_feature}}:
**{{cd|places_block}} now supports a list of weighted block specifiers.
**New {{cd|randomize_rotation}} property.
**New {{cd|may_not_attach_to}} placement conditions.
**Added {{cd|diagonal}} as a new option for {{cd|may_attach_to}} conditions.
**File format version increased to {{cd|1.21.40}}.

'''Graphical'''
*Add new {{cd|the_end.client_biome.json}} as the first new type of file to contain per-biome rendering and audio settings in resource packs.
*Starting with base game version 1.21.40, built-in {{cd|biomes_client.json}} files are no longer loaded. That file from other packs continue to be loaded. Water and fog settings are now in individual {{cd|client_biome.json }} files in resource packs. When both {{cd|biomes_client.json}} and the individual {{cd|client_biome.json}} file specify competing values, the loaded {{cd|biomes_client.json}} from creator content have priority.

'''[[Item]]s'''
*The {{cd|minecraft:item}} object is parsed with a strict loader from {{cd|1.21.40}}:
**Numbers and booleans are no longer interchangeable in the JSON input.
**Floating point numbers are no longer accepted where an integer is expected.
*The {{cd|minecraft:bundle_interaction}}, and {{cd|minecraft:bundle_interaction}} item components have been de-experimentified.

'''[[Molang]]'''
*Molang queries {{cd|wing_flap_position}} and {{cd|wing_flap_speed}} now work for the [[chicken]].

'''Resource and Behavior Packs'''
*Built-in packs now include archive files for improved load performance on some platforms.

'''Stability and Performance'''
*Increased the size of biome ids in saved chunk data from 8 bit to 16 bit values.

'''[[Direct item forms of blocks|Technical blocks]]'''
* Merged the separate and direct item form of the [[head]]s (<code>item.skull</code>).

==== Technical ====
'''[[Add-on]]s and Script Engine'''
