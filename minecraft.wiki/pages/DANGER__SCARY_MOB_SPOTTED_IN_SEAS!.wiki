'''DANGER: SCARY MOB SPOTTED IN SEAS!''' is a short story written by [[Tom Stone]], published on [[Minecraft.net]].<ref>{{Mcnet|danger-scary-mob-spotted-seas|DANGER: SCARY MOB SPOTTED IN SEAS!|July 2, 2018|Tom Stone}}</ref>

== Summary ==
A new terror has surfaced in Minecraft's oceans with the arrival of the [[Update Aquatic]] (Phase One), turning what was meant to be a joyful dive into a watery nightmare. Players now face an unexpected threat—The [[Drowned]], a zombie-like underwater mob that lurks beneath the colorful reefs and playful [[dolphins]].

The article gathers reports from "witnesses" like Sid Plimps, a questionable source who claims he saw a zombie sink into the sea only to reappear as the terrifying drowned. Sid, originally searching for [[rotten flesh]], was horrified by the mob, continuing to scream long after the encounter.

Fisherman Matthew Denton shares a similarly chilling experience. After attempting to retrieve a [[fishing rod]] from the sea, he witnessed a sinister figure—"someone wrong"—holding it underwater. The drowned have also been seen wielding weapons like the [[trident]], with one victim mistaking it for a large fork, adding an extra layer of danger for unsuspecting players.

Though the article conveys the lighthearted tone of Minecraft, it warns players of the underwater undead that now haunt the deep seas. Players on [[Java Edition]] can already confront this new menace, while others will soon face the drowned as the Update Aquatic rolls out across platforms. Stay cautious—something sinister is beneath the waves.
