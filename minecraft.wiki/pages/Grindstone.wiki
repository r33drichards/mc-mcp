A '''grindstone''' is a [[block]] used to remove all [[enchantment]]s (except for [[curse#Enchantments|curse]]s) from [[item]]s, refunding some [[experience orb]]s. Additionally, it can  repair [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s and [[armor]]. It also serves as a [[weaponsmith]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Grindstones can be obtained using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Grindstone|pickaxe|wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Weaponsmith shelter.jpg|thumb|right|A grindstone generated inside a weaponsmith shelter structure.]]
Grindstones naturally generate at [[village]] weaponsmiths. Grindstones can also generate in [[trail ruins]].

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A1= Stick
|B1= Stone Slab
|C1= Stick
|A2= Any Planks
|C2= Any Planks
|Output= Grindstone
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
A grindstone can be oriented in different directions. {{IN|Java}}, it doesn't need a supporting block. {{IN|Bedrock}}, it breaks if unsupported and/or inside of water.

=== Repairing and disenchanting ===
[[File:Grindstone GUI.png|thumb|right|250px|Interface for the grindstone]]

{{Redirect|Grinder|information about the grinder of mobs|Tutorial:Mob grinder}}

When {{control|used}}, an interface is displayed with two input slots and one output slot.

It resets the [[Anvil mechanics|repair cost]] for items.

When one [[enchanted]] item is placed in either input slot, a disenchanted copy of the item appears in the output slot. The output item has the same durability for a piece of armor or a tool. If an [[enchanted book]] is placed in the input, a normal [[book]] appears in the output. Removing the item from the output slot deletes the input item and causes the grindstone to drop some [[experience]]. If the input item has a custom name, given by [[Anvil mechanics#Renaming|renaming]] it, the output item will adopt the name.

Placing two [[tool]]s or pieces of [[armor]] (enchanted or not) of the same type in the input slots causes a non-enchanted item of the same type to appear in the output slot. The output item has the same durability as what the player would get from using the [[item repair]] crafting recipe if the 2 input items were unenchanted. This means the output durability is the sum of the durabilities of the two input items, plus 5% of the maximum durability of the output item (rounded down), capped so it does not exceed the maximum durability of the output item. Both input items are deleted in this process of disenchanting them and repairing them. If either input item was enchanted, then removing the output item drops some [[experience]]. The output item has the same [[armor trim]] (if any) and name (if any) as the input item in the top slot.

The amount of experience dropped by the grindstone scales based on the [[Enchanting/Levels|modified enchantment levels]] of all the enchantments on both input items, and is somewhat random. For example, disenchanting a weapon with [[Sharpness V]] gives about 35 XP on average. {{Info needed|What is the formula or psuedocode that determines this?}}

As with all non-enchanted items, the output item has no [[Anvil mechanics#Anvil uses|prior work penalty]], even if it is cursed. Disenchanting an item in the grindstone cannot remove a [[curse]], and cannot remove an item's custom name.

If the action is not applicable (e.g. only one non-enchanted item, or the two inputs are different items), the arrow displays a red cross like that of an [[anvil]] and no item appears in the output slot.

The following tables show the durability bonuses of various items:{{Info needed|Do any of these bonsuses deviate from the supposedly fixed 5% durability boost every item gets? If so, then why is this table here?}}

== Trivia ==
* Before the grindstone was added, a different method to remove enchantments was floated for [[Update Aquatic]], which would have been by means of feeding items to a mob known as "[[Great Hunger|the Great Hunger]]", but the mob lost the [[MINECON Earth 2017]] mob vote to the [[phantom]].
