{{Exclusive|java|plural=1}}
Since the beginning of ''[[Minecraft]]'''s development, there have been a number of features added to the game that have no actual use in Survival or in Creative. Some of these features are leftover from removed features, or simply placeholders for new features.

'''This article documents only unused features that are currently in the game.''' See [[Java Edition removed features]] for features previously in the game that are no longer available.

== Blocks ==
=== Unobtainable block states ===
{| class="wikitable"
! Block
! State
! Effect
|-
! {{BlockLink|Decorated pot}}
| <code>cracked: true</code>
| When this is set to <code>true</code>, the decorated pot always drops its sherds or bricks regardless of how it is broken.
|-
! {{BlockLink|Piston head}}
| <code>short: true</code>
| Piston heads that have this set to <code>true</code> appear shorter by 4 pixels. This state itself does not seem to be used for the piston extension/retraction animation, but its model is used during the animation.
|-
! {{BlockLink|TNT}}
| <code>unstable: true</code>
| Breaking TNT that has this set to <code>true</code> does the same thing as lighting it, eventually causing an explosion.
|}

=== Unobtainable block state combinations ===
{{info needed section|no face states for resin?}}
Certain blocks have certain combinations of block states that cannot be encountered in usual Survival gameplay, and instead require using [[command]]s, the [[debug stick]], a [[debug world]], or certain glitches, many version-specific. Some may also be able to be created via update suppression methods, or be able to be created in older game versions and updated forward. As these are impossible to encounter, mapmakers may be able to use some of them as blank slates and remodel these using model files for custom blocks as these cannot be encountered in any gameplay. These states are generally fragile.

== Entities ==
=== Giant ===
{{main|Giant}}
[[File:Zombie.png|100px|right]]

Giants are an unused [[mob]] added in [[Indev]]. They appear to be a giant [[zombie]]. Giants have no movement AI, therefore they are unable to walk around. They cannot spawn naturally because the game requires the light level to be both greater than 11 and less than 8 and those conditions cannot be met in vanilla. This makes them impossible to spawn via [[monster spawner]]s.

Giants can be summoned only by using the {{cmd|summon minecraft:giant}} command.

In the [[Java Edition 18w50a|18w50a snapshot]], the giant has an AI and is able to attack the player. The AI was removed in the [[Java Edition 19w03a|19w03a snapshot]].

In the [[20w14infinite|2020 April Fools' snapshot]], the giant is able to naturally spawn on occasion in custom dimensions.

In the [[Java Edition 24w14potato|2024 April Fools' snapshot]], a retextured giant can spawn in the colloseum, in the [[Potato dimension]]. It is a part of the boss fight with [[mega spud]], and has an AI.

=== The killer bunny ===
{{main|Killer Rabbit}}
[[File:Killer Bunny.png|100px|right]]

A variant of the rabbit that is hostile toward all [[Wolf|wolves]], [[Fox|foxes]], and [[Player|players]]. Its fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal [[rabbit]]'s vertical eyes.

If the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops quickly toward the player, much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a [[spider]]. Once it closes in, it lunges at the player, dealing a fair amount of damage. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player. Killer rabbits are also immune to the [[Thorns]] enchantment.

If it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any [[wolves]] as well, including tamed wolves. These wolves, in turn, turn hostile and attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.

On Peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves (both tamed and untamed).

The killer bunny can be spawned only with the {{cmd|summon minecraft:rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} }} command.

=== Illusioner ===
{{main|Illusioner}}
[[File:Illusioner.png|100px|right]]

An unused [[illager]]<!-- Illager is correct --> that was added in [[Java Edition 1.12]]. Like other illagers, they attack [[player]]s, [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s and [[iron golem]]s within a 12 blocks range. It attacks with its spells, and with its [[bow]].

It has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent, and a spell that summons duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.

The illusioner has a face that is just like the face of an [[evoker]], formerly of a [[vindicator]].

Illusioners can be spawned only with the {{cmd|summon minecraft:illusioner}} command.

=== Minecart with monster spawner ===
{{main|Minecart with Monster Spawner}}
[[File:Minecart with Spawner JE2.png|100px|right]]

A combination of a [[minecart]] and a [[monster spawner]]. Cannot be obtained as an item in the inventory, and can be placed only by using the {{cmd|summon minecraft:spawner_minecart}} [[command]].

The monster spawner inside the minecart acts the same way as normal monster spawners, and the mob being spawned can be changed with <code>[[Commands/data|/data modify]]</code>.

When killed, minecarts with monster spawners drop 1 {{ItemLink|minecart}}.

=== Unused paintings ===
{{main|Painting#Unused paintings}}

In [[Pocket Edition v0.5.0 alpha|v0.5.0 alpha]], with the addition of paintings to Pocket Edition, four unused 32×32 paintings were present in <samp>[[kz.png]]</samp> that remained unused. They were also added to Java Edition in snapshot [[22w16a]]. They can be summoned by [[commands]] (such as {{cmd|/summon minecraft:painting ~ ~ ~ {variant:"water"} }}) or through a [[data pack]]. They can also be found in the ''Operator Utilities'' tab in the [[Creative inventory]].

According to [[Helen Zbihlyj]]<ref>https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/u8hpnx/thoughts_on_the_new_paintings/i5olue6/?context=3 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20220422115723/https://old.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/u8hpnx/thoughts_on_the_new_paintings/i5olue6/?context=3 archived])</ref>, these paintings were originally added "as part of a Pocket Edition promo map" (no footage found) that was planned to be a part of [[Pocket Edition]] promotion at [[MINECON 2012]] [[MINECON 2013|or 2013]] and have never been used in game. The artist of these paintings remains unknown.

== Status effects ==
{{main|Status effects}}{{See also|Fatal Poison}}
Various status effects remain unused in the game. They can be obtained only by using {{cmd|effect}} or [[potion]] NBT data.

=== {{EffectLink|Luck}} ===
Luck increases the chance of high-quality loot. The Luck effect can be obtained from [[Potion of Luck|potions of luck]], [[Splash Potion of Luck|splash potions of luck]], [[Lingering Potion of Luck|lingering potions of luck]] and [[Arrow of Luck|arrows of luck]]; These items require commands to be obtained.

From snapshot [[19w13a]] to [[1.14 Pre-Release 1]], arrows of luck could be obtained from [[Trading#Fletcher|fletcher villagers]] when the player had the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect.

=== {{EffectLink|Bad Luck}} ===
Bad Luck is the opposite of Luck; it reduces the chances of high-quality loot. Bad Luck cannot be obtained from potions; It can only be obtained via {{cmd|effect}}.

=== {{EffectLink|Health Boost}} ===
Added in [[Java Edition 1.6.1]] snapshot [[13w23b]]. The effect boosted the [[player]]'s hearts for the duration of the effect. It could be obtained from eating a [[golden apple]]. Since snapshot [[13w24b]], golden apples give the player Absorption instead of Health Boost, but the effect was left in the game.

In [[Java Edition 1.9]] the Health Boost effect's texture was changed to be distinct from Absorption and was again remade in [[Java Edition 1.14]] by [[Jasper Boerstra]] (commonly known as Jappa).

Curiously, the "affectionate scream" can be heard in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DhWXAiNgfQ&ab_channel=Minecraft&t=63s Nether Update Official Trailer] at 1:03 – 1:04.

== Developer tools ==
{{main|Java developer tools}}There is code for numerous development tools. They remain unused in the latest version of ''Java Edition'' but can be enabled with the help of mods.

== Resources ==
{{main|History of textures/Unused textures}}
Various resources located in the game's assets files that remain unused.

=== Armor stand ===
The [[armor stand]]'s texture contains the text "Searge", which is [[Michael Stoyke]]'s nickname, "Jappa", which is [[Jasper Boerstra]]'s nickname, and "Chiwi", which is Chi Wong's nickname.

=== Map icons ===
Some extra icons for [[map]]s. The white and green arrows are the only ones used normally, though the colored arrows are used for multiplayer {{in|bedrock}}.
==Mob attacks==
=== Skeleton melee attack ===
[[Skeleton]]s normally wield bows, but if one were to spawn in a skeleton with a [[sword]], the skeleton can use it like a normal weapon.

=== Wither skeleton ranged attack ===
If a [[wither skeleton]] is spawned with a bow, it can use it as intended, except the arrow is always on fire, even without lava or enchantments.
