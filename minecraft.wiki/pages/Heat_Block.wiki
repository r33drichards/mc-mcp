'''Heat block''' is a [[block]] that can melt [[snow]] and [[ice]] like a [[torch]], but it does not give off [[light]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break heat block is [[pickaxe]]. Heat block needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.

== Trivia ==
* The ingredients of the heat block [https://www.wired.com/2014/12/whats-inside-hot-hands/ corresponds to the contents of hand warmers]. A hand warmer generates heat due to the same electrochemistry that rusts iron in seawater, but with powdered iron the effect becomes more appreciable.
