'''Legacy Console Edition''' refers to several discontinued, closely-related editions of ''[[Minecraft]]'' developed by [[4J Studios]] for game consoles. It includes:
* ''[[Xbox 360 Edition|Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition]]''
* ''[[Xbox One Edition|Minecraft: Xbox One Edition]]'' (Replaced by [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']])
* ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition|Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition]]''
* ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition|Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' (Replaced by [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']])
* ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition|Minecraft: PlayStation Vita Edition]]''
* ''[[Wii U Edition|Minecraft: Wii U Edition]]''
* ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition|Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' (Replaced by [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']])

Legacy Console Edition introduced new features such as a simplified [[crafting]] system, in-game [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial|tutorials]], [[leaderboards]], built-in [[mini games]] and [[Splitscreen/Legacy Console Edition|split-screen]] [[multiplayer]] on home consoles, local [[Wireless Play]] on handhelds, as well as online multiplayer for up to 8 players (up to 4 on PS Vita, and up to 16 in mini games on Xbox One and PS4). As with all editions, updates were free of charge.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Minecraft-Xbox360.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot of ''Xbox 360 Edition'']]
The objective of the game remains the same as its {{els|je|be}} counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. There is no preset goal; the player may choose to set their own goals.

For the most part, Legacy Console Edition is almost identical to ''Java Edition'' with few apparent differences,<ref>{{tweet|notch|77817236391346177|I don't know if I'm allowed to say, but yes.|June 6, 2011}}</ref> but was released with the ''Xbox 360 Edition'' in an earlier version equivalent to ''Java Edition'' [[Legacy Console Edition version history#TU1|Beta 1.6.6]], rather than the current ''Java Edition'' version at the time of release, [[Java Edition 1.2.5|1.2.5]]. The ''Wii U Edition'' was released with an earlier version equivalent to ''Java Edition'' [[Legacy Console Edition version history#TU19|1.6.4]], rather than the current ''Java Edition'' version at the time of release, [[Java Edition 1.8.9|1.8.9]]. In the later updates, shortly before its discontinuation, Legacy Console Edition also received several features from ''Bedrock Edition'' (e.g. movable tile entities) to prepare for Legacy Console Edition being taken off the market.

=== Differences from ''Java'' and ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{main|Legacy Console Edition exclusive features}}
From a technical perspective, Legacy Console Edition's features remained predominantly faithful to {{JE}}, unlike {{BE}}. As a result, parity between Legacy Console Editions and Java versions is far greater than parity between Legacy Editions and its spiritual successor, Bedrock Edition. Differences from {{els|je|be}} include:

* The game features [[splitscreen]] functionality;<ref>{{tweet|jeb|145846150505832448|We'll have that on the xbox version!|December 11, 2011}}</ref> a HDTV with a YPbPr (component) or HDMI connection is required for split-screen play. Split-screen functionality works with a VGA connection to a PC monitor as well as HDMI-to-DVI cables to a PC monitor. Up to 4 players can play in split screen, as well as the possibility to play 8-person online multiplayer game modes in split-screen. ''Nintendo Switch Edition'' also supports splitscreen on the console's own screen, as well as local wireless communications. ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' supports up to 2-4 players online and Ad-Hoc support.
** These features were carried over to the console ports of ''Bedrock Edition''.
* The game includes an automatic [[crafting]] system where it is not required to place the blocks in the grid. There is an option to use the manual crafting grid from ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition''.
** The recipe book in later versions could be considered an extra take on this.
* Legacy Console Edition includes a version-exclusive [[Legacy Console Edition Tutorial|tutorial mode]]. This tutorial leads the player through the basics of [[breaking]] and placing [[block]]s, [[crafting]], as well as [[Tutorial:Beginner's guide|building their first house]] to survive the [[Daylight cycle|night]], [[fishing]], [[enchanting]], [[brewing]], and more.<ref>{{ytl|fc2DJczzYZ0|NEW! Minecraft for Xbox 360 - Tutorial Overview|HatFilms}}</ref>
* The [[player]] always begins a new world with an [[Map|empty map]] in their inventory.
** This feature was later added as an option in ''Bedrock Edition''.
* World size is [[World size|limited]].
* Unlike on Bedrock Edition—which lacked the [[superflat]] world type at the time—Legacy Console Edition feature an extensive superflat world type that allows for [[structure]], [[cave]], [[ore]], [[water]], [[lava]], [[biome]], and flora generation, alongside customizable world layers.
* Players can choose from three different biome scale options when generating a world.
** The seeds for a 'large' world in the final TU are mostly identical to 1.12.2 in terms of terrain generation, though a different algorithm is used to generate the position of Mushroom biomes. Certain structures are also set to appear more frequently in later versions of Legacy Console Edition, most notably the [[Woodland Mansion|woodland mansion]] and the [[Pillager Outpost|pillager outpost]].
* Skins can be chosen only from those available as default or from [[Skin pack|downloadable content]]. Players cannot import their own skins for use in the game, unlike {{JE}}.
** This restriction was carried over to the console versions of {{BE}}. Other versions of ''Bedrock Edition'', like the PC and mobile versions, still allow the player to use their own skins.
* Breeding and utility mob spawning works the same as ''Java Edition'', but the [[Spawn limit|amount of mobs is limited]].
* The [[villager]] trading UI is completely different.
* When flying, the player is restricted to 8-way digital directional movement, meaning that they cannot drift in a full circle. This was done to increase precision when building with a controller.
* The [[The Nether|Nether]] dimension in a superflat world is also flat, whereas {{in|Bedrock|Java}}, when creating a [[Superflat|flat]] world{{only|be|short=1}} or [[superflat]] world{{only|je|short=1}}, the Nether terrain generation is the same as in a regular world.
* [[Nether Wart|Nether wart]] randomly generates on [[Soul Sand|soul sand]] in the Nether.
* [[Wither Skeleton|Wither skeletons]] spawn everywhere in the Nether, instead of just in [[Nether Fortress|nether fortresses]].
* [[Blaze|Blazes]] have glowstone as a part of their [[loot table]].
* The edge of the Nether is a [[bedrock]] wall.
* There are no public [[server]]s. The player's world may be hosted, similarly to a server, by enabling the option '''Allow Friends of Friends to join''', however, there is a limit of 8 players (4 in the ''PlayStation Vita Edition'') in an online game.
* [[Statistics]] are replaced with [[leaderboards]], with the exception of ''Wii U'' and ''Nintendo Switch Edition'', where neither of these features are present.
* A large amount of [[TNT]] cannon designs do not work, because the maximum amount of lit TNT entities that can exist on a world is small.
* Even when in [[Creative]] mode, players die when falling into the [[void]] in [[the End]] dimension—a feature carried over from ''Java Edition'', but absent in ''Bedrock Edition''.
* Some sound effects were retained from earlier versions, such as the skeleton's death sound.
* The 360 and PS3 versions seem to use completely different lighting systems, both from each other and from any other version of Minecraft.

=== Different modes ===
The different gameplay modes and settings may vary from the other platform versions.

=== Creative ===
Using Creative mode permanently disables achievements/trophies and leaderboard updates during normal gameplay on that world; however, the core mechanics of flight and infinite resources remain the same.

=== Adventure ===
Blocks can be destroyed by the [[Breaking#Best tools|proper tools and depending on the block, the quality of the tool]]. Example: [[wool]] blocks can be destroyed by using [[shears]], while only an [[Iron Pickaxe|iron pickaxe]] or higher can break and gather [[Gold Ore|gold ore]] blocks.

=== Survival ===
In Survival mode:

:* Fists and any tool can break blocks such as [[bed]]s.
:* The quality of the tool affects the breaking speed of the block.
:*Progression of the game is similar to other versions of the game; however, in the [[The End|End dimension]] to travel to other islands, you must teleport, as there exist invisible walls outside the area.

===X/Z distance effects===
{{main|World size}}
At the edges of the world, which varies depending on the console and [[world size]], there exists an invisible barrier that cannot be bypassed (not even in Creative Mode). Below sea level, the barrier is comprised of gravel. Past this barrier, an ocean with a flat stone sea floor generates up until X/Z 2,800, in which blocks stop rendering, although the physics still exist.

== Discontinuation timeline ==
On September 20, 2017, the ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' was withdrawn from the Microsoft Store, in conjunction with {{BE}}'s [[Better Together Update]]. People who owned it were entitled to download the ''Bedrock Edition'' of ''[[Minecraft]]'' for free. Worlds and DLC were intended to be transferable to ''Bedrock Edition'', however, some DLC do not carry over. Users can also continue to play on the ''Xbox One Edition'' instead. This also happened with the ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' on June 21, 2018, and ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' on December 10, 2019.<ref>{{Mcnet|everything-announced-minecon-earth|Everything Announced at MINECON Earth!|November 18, 2017}}</ref><ref name=PS4Bedrock>{{Mcnet|ps4-news|Bedrock is coming to PS4|December 9, 2019}}</ref> Again, some DLC does not transfer on these platforms. 

Initially, ''Xbox One Edition'' was planned to no longer receive updates, starting with the lack of an equivalent update to [[Xbox 360 Edition TU58|TU58]], but the edition later received [[Xbox One Edition CU50|CU50]], an update adding the MINECON Earth Skin Pack, and later updates resumed entirely with [[Xbox One Edition CU51|CU51]], an update equivalent to [[Xbox 360 Edition TU60|TU60]], which also added all the features from TU58.

On May 3, 2018, Mojang officially announced that the ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'', and ''[[Wii U Edition]]'' would receive the [[Update Aquatic]], but would receive no further feature updates after its release. The ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' did not get the Update Aquatic. The ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' would still receive feature updates until December 10, 2019 (including Update Aquatic and [[Village & Pillage]]), when it was replaced with {{BE}} on the platform, at which point the legacy Console Edition codebase was discontinued entirely.<ref name=PS4Bedrock/><ref>{{Mcnet|update-aquatic-coming-legacy-console-editions|Update Aquatic Coming to Legacy Console Editions|May 3, 2018}}</ref> Despite being discontinued, ''Xbox One Edition'', ''Nintendo Switch Edition'' and ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' are playable on the {{w|Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X&#124;S}}, {{w|Nintendo Switch 2}} and {{w|PlayStation 5}} respectively via backward compatibility.<ref>https://xbox.com/games/store/-/BT6HNJH658C6</ref>

Although worlds can still be transferred from ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'' to ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'', the worlds cannot be loaded due to the ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'' using a newer version of the game. As of April 15, 2020, the ability to transfer worlds from ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'' and ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'' to ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' has been terminated. Support for world transfers from ''[[Wii U Edition]]'' to ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' also ended with the shutdown of the Nintendo Network on April 8, 2024.

By the end of 2019, all legacy Console Edition games had ceased receiving new major updates.

As of the shutdown of the Wii U eShop and Xbox 360 Marketplace on March 27, 2023, and July 29, 2024, respectively, it is no longer possible to digitally purchase the ''[[Wii U Edition]]'' or the ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'' of the game via official means, though they can still be redownloaded if the game was previously purchased and physical copies still function normally.

== Trivia ==
* [[4J Studios]], the company that ported ''Minecraft'' to consoles, also ported several other video games, namely ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''{{w|Banjo-Tooie}}'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'' for XBLA as well as ''{{w|The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion}}'' for PS3.
* Notch originally stated that the {{w|Xbox 360}} would be the sole console provider of ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{tweet|notch|128564849809694720|Minecraft on consoles is Xbox 360 exclusive!|October 24, 2011}}</ref> However, {{w|Sony}} later announced editions for the {{w|PlayStation 3|PS3}}, {{w|PlayStation 4|PS4}}, and {{w|PlayStation Vita|PS Vita}}/{{w|PlayStation TV|PS TV}}.<ref>{{tweet|notch|369892812185436160|PS4, PS3 and Vita|August 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|4JStudios|370111405216649216|Happy to confirm we're developing Minecraft PS3, PS4 & PS Vita Editions for Mojang, as well as Xbox 360 & Xbox One Editions!|August 21, 2013}}</ref> Mojang also later released the ''[[Xbox One Edition|Xbox One]]'', ''[[Wii U Edition|Wii U]]'', and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition|Nintendo Switch]]'' editions.
* In Creative, entering the [[Void]] is not possible without external tools (except in the End, where it is easily accessible due to the large gaps between the islands), as the lowest level of bedrock remains indestructible in that mode. 
* The player can grab edge blocks with sticky pistons. However, it's impossible to push blocks into the edge.
* Spiders can climb the edge of the world, as it's classified as a block.
* The [[player]] cannot fly to the top. While it is 2,147,483,647 blocks tall, the world height is only 511 blocks tall, so the player cannot go anywhere near the top. Despite this, using enough TNT Minecarts to launch a player in Creative Mode can sometimes make the player break the game and end up above the 511 block height limit, but they are unable to fly back down or move in this state, forcing the player to kill themselves or exit the game.
*The [[wither]] performs its dash attack much more often than its {{BE}} counterpart.
*Due to the limited world size, the [[woodland mansion]] is much easier to find, provided that there are [[dark forest]] biomes. Sometimes the game can spawn the player right next to one. This is incredibly common to see in the classic world size. Given that the option is selected, the game tries to find a seed with at least one of the most structures in its given area.
*The {{w|Nintendo Switch 2}} is backward compatible with the ''Nintendo Switch Edition''; however, the game suffers from several stability issues that are not present when played on an original Nintendo Switch. For example, opening a [[map]] in a world transferred from a Nintendo Switch may cause the item to duplicate infinitely, resulting in graphical errors that ultimately lead to a game crash.<ref>{{reddit|1l4lpje/minecraft_nintendo_switch_edition_on_switch_2||Minecraft Nintendo switch edition on switch 2 crashes when you use maps|ThePINGUSDINGUS|June 6, 2025}}</ref>
