== Trivia ==
* In the [[title screen]], when the language is set to Afrikaans, this snapshot includes a phrase in English calling the user a racial slur in place of the Singleplayer button's text. [[Mojang]] lead developer [[Jens Bergensten]] acknowledged the problem and explained that it was the result of a prankster abusing the [[Crowdin|open translation system]]. The offensive content was removed in the [[Java Edition 12w05a|next snapshot]], and the responsible user was banned.<ref>{{Citation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406162322/https://kotaku.com/5880007/racial-epithet-shows-up-on-minecraft-menu-developer-apologizes|archive-time=6 April 2012|url=https://kotaku.com/5880007/racial-epithet-shows-up-on-minecraft-menu-developer-apologizes|title=Racial Epithet Shows Up on ''Minecraft'' Menu, Developer Apologizes|date=27 January 2012|website=Kotaku|author=Kirk Hamilton}}</ref>
** When the language is set to "Ingles (Uruguay)", the "Singleplayer", "Multiplayer" and "Texture Packs" button texts are replaced with the Spanish phrase "Otra razón para odiarte...", which translates to "Another reason to hate you...". It's very likely that this is also a prank, as both the language title and the main menu buttons' contents weren't vandalized in the [[Java Edition 12w03a|previous snapshot]].
