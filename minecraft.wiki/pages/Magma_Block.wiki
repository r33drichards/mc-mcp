A '''magma block''' is a [[light]]-emitting [[block]] found underwater in the [[Overworld]], and more abundantly in [[the Nether]]. It deals burning damage while stood on, which can be prevented by {{Control|sneak|text=sneaking}}. [[Water|Underwater]] magma blocks produce [[bubble columns]] that pull [[entities]] downward and provide [[Drowning|air]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
Magma blocks can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Group_of_underwater_magma.png|thumb|right|Natural generation of magma blocks underwater in the Overworld.]]
[[File:Nether Magma Block.png|thumb|right|Natural generation of magma blocks in the Nether.]]
==== Overworld ====
In the Overworld, magma blocks generate at the bottom of water [[aquifer]]s in [[underwater magma]] features, in clusters of 1–8 blocks.

Magma blocks also generate as a part of [[ocean ruins]], [[ruined portal]]s that are not in cold biomes, and the <code>eruption</code> room found in [[trial chambers]].

==== The Nether ====
Magma blocks generate in [[the Nether]] in the form of [[Ore (feature)|ore feature]]s. {{IN|java}}, it attempts to generate 4 times per [[chunk]] in sizes of 0–160, from [[altitude]]s Y=27 to Y=36 in all biomes. It can only replace [[netherrack]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, it attempts to generate 9 times per [[chunk]] in sizes of 0–106, from [[altitude]]s Y=23 to Y=36 in all biomes. It can replace [[netherrack]] and [[blackstone]].

Magma blocks generate as part of [[delta]]s in [[basalt deltas]] biomes, replacing some of the lava.

Magma blocks also generate as a part of hoglin stable and treasure room [[bastion remnant]]s, as well as all ruined portals in this dimension.

== Usage ==

=== Damage ===

Magma blocks damage most living entities standing on top of them, even if underwater, dealing {{hp|1}} of fire damage every [[tick]], which in practice is reduced to once every half-second with [[damage immunity]]. Walking into the side of a magma block doesn't cause damage. Damage from magma blocks does not reduce [[durability]] in [[netherite]] armor. Because magma blocks deal fire damage, it can be reduced by [[armor]], the [[Resistance]] effect, and [[Protection]]/[[Fire Protection]] enchantments, and can be completely negated by the [[Fire Resistance]] effect.  Unlike other sources of fire damage, [[sneaking]] and the [[Frost Walker]] enchantment can also grant immunity to damage from magma blocks.

Any mobs immune to fire damage cannot take damage from magma blocks. However, a few mobs like [[shulker]]s cannot take magma block damage despite not having natural immunity to fire.

Magma blocks do not set mobs or players on fire and thus do not cook the animals that they kill, nor do they destroy [[item (entity)|items]].

Blocks that are the [[Solid block#Height|height]] of a [[trapdoor]] or lower (such as [[snow|snow layer]]s, [[carpet]]s, [[repeater]]s, or [[comparator]]s) do not prevent a magma block from damaging mobs and players above it.<ref>{{bug|MC-263282||Magma blocks damage entities through thin blocks, such as lecterns and snow layers|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-173163||Carpet does not prevent damage from Magma blocks|Invalid}}</ref> However, a sunken [[boat]] on top of the magma block prevents damage.

There are a few specific [[death messages]] associated with magma blocks. If a player or named pet is killed simply from standing on the block, the death message displayed in the chat is: ''"[player] discovered the floor was lava"''. If a player or named pet was attacked and knocked back to their death onto magma blocks, the message is: ''"[player] walked into danger zone due to [player/mob]"''.

=== Behavior ===

Magma blocks emit a [[light]] level of 3. They do not melt [[ice]] or [[snow]].

Magma blocks emit smoke particles under rainfall, much like [[lava]].

Making walls out of magma blocks prevents [[spider]]s from climbing them.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}

Mobs try to avoid walking over magma blocks but still walk over them if no other path is found. Most mobs do not spawn on magma blocks (exceptions are [[magma cube]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, [[ghast]]s, and [[squid]]).

When a magma block's top is set on [[fire]], the fire burns indefinitely, similar to [[netherrack]].

=== Bubble columns ===

When a water source is directly above a magma block, a [[Bubble Column#Whirlpool|whirlpool bubble column]] is created, going down from the highest source block. Anything encountering the bubble column is pulled down, including items, boats, players, and mobs. 

A player can restore [[Damage#Drowning|breath]] underwater by entering a magma block's bubble column.

=== Note blocks ===
Magma blocks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Trivia ==

* Geologists only call melted rock ''magma'' when it's very deep underground, beyond accessibility. Any melt closer to the surface is called ''lava''.
* A magma block is used as Steve's Up-Smash attack in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
