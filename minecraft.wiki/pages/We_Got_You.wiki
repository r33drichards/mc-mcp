== PC Game Pass. We Got You. ==

=== Summary ===
As a player is scrolling PC Game pass in their bedroom, a narrator chimes in to warm them that they're in a commercial. Visibly concerned, the narrator then pivots to asking the player if they want to play ''{{w|Call of Duty: Black Ops 6}}'', which the player agrees to. Suddenly, their screen begins to glitch out, before their room begins to glitch out itself, impressing them. Suddenly, the scene changes to a second player, on a fluffy couch with a {{Wikipedia|Lenovo Legion Go}}, who is suddenly asked if they want to pilot an {{Wikipedia|Airbus}} while playing ''{{w|Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024}}''. As they're revealed to be inside a plane, the player exclaims they don't know how to fly, as the narrator concedes they don't either.

In an office building, a stressed person remarks they want a new career, as opposed to being in a cubicle. The narrator introduces them to ''{{w|The Sims 4}}'', which causes the office worker to transform into a rockstar and perform an office party. Abruptly, the scene changes to a fourth player asking for a "great adventure." The narrator asks if they've heard of the Great Circle, which they haven't, as a suitcase of equipment from {{Wikipedia|Indiana Jones (character)|Indiana Jones}} himself falls into the room. The narrator then asks "who's next," cutting to a player in a green lit room, who asks to play with "all ''{{w|League of Legends}}'' champions." They do, suddenly appearing at a world series alongside them.

== AAA Titles? Goats? We Got You. ==

=== Summary ===
In a kitchen, the narrator asks a player if they "want high quality PC Games?" Asserting that they have, many things in the room begin to transform into ''Minecraft'' equivalents, including [[Painting|paintings]], a dog becoming an [[Wolf Armor|armored]] [[wolf]], and a [[zombie]]. Another player is asked if they would like to be a goat, presumably implying GOAT.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/g-o-a-t/|title=G.O.A.T. Meaning & Origin {{!}} Slang by Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com|date=June 28, 2018}}</ref> Instead, the narrator remarks "we GOAT you" as a pun, and transforms the player into a goat from the game ''{{w|Goat Simulator 3}}'', whose tongue pulls down a librarian's desk.
