'''Steve's Appeal to SeaNanners and Notch''' was the first video ever uploaded to the ''[[Minecraft (franchise)|Minecraft]]'' [[YouTube]] channel. It is a live action sketch of [[Steve]], performed with a simple cardboard head, professing his troubled upbringing and traumatic experiences, as a response to a stream by {{Wikipedia|Machinima, Inc.|Machinima}}.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://mojang.com/2011/02/09/notch-and-seananners-high-fiving-in-la/|title=Notch and SeaNanners High-Fiving in LA|author=Carl Manneh|website=Mojang|date=February 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216121415/http://mojang.com/2011/02/09/notch-and-seananners-high-fiving-in-la/}}</ref>

== Summary ==
Steve stands in the middle of a road during winter, before appearing in a building cutting a banana on a board. Greeting the viewer, he explains how "they" used to physically assault him during school. The video cuts to him on the street, getting pelted with snowballs. He then explains he was put into a band camp by his parents, but wasn't very good, cutting to him performing music on an {{Wikipedia|iPad}}. This led to him "dabbing into gaming," which he was also bad at and found overstimulating, until he found [[Minecraft]].

As soon as he found the game, it resonated deeply with him, leading him to somehow play the game with [[Markus Persson]]. Eventually he played the game with the creator, and the YouTuber {{Wikipedia|Adam Montoya}}. Apparently, he felt great bliss during this experience, and erected a build of the phrase "WE MISS U NOTCH ♡" out of [[cobblestone]] and [[Block of Gold|gold]].
