'''Short dry grass''' is a one-block tall foliage block that generates frequently in [[desert]]s and all types of [[badlands]]. It grows on [[sand]] and [[terracotta]]. It can also be eaten by [[sheep]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Short dry grass is immediately destroyed when broken.
{{breaking row|Short Dry Grass|drop=0|shears=1|horizontal=1}}
Short dry grass drops nothing when it's destroyed using a tool without [[Silk Touch]] or not using the [[shears]].<br>
Short dry grass drops itself when it's destroyed using a tool with Silk Touch or the shears.
=== Natural generation ===
Short dry grass generates in [[desert]]s and [[badlands]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post generation ===
Using [[Bone Meal|bone meal]] on [[tall dry grass]] places a short dry grass on a neighboring block if possible.

== Usage ==
Short dry grass can be used for aesthetic decoration. Short dry grass can be placed on any of the following blocks:
{{columns-list|style=column-count:2|
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Terracotta}}
* {{BlockLink|Sand}}
* {{BlockLink|Suspicious Sand}}
* {{BlockLink|Red Sand}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, short dry grass can be [[snowlogged]].

When a [[sheep]] eats short dry grass, the block is removed, and a [[shear]]ed sheep regrows its [[wool]]. Baby sheep graze grass 20 times more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

=== Fuel ===
When used in a [[furnace]] as [[fuel]], a piece of short dry grass lasts 5 seconds (smelting half an item).

=== Composting ===
Placing short dry grass into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1, the lowest possible chance.

=== Bone meal ===
[[Bone Meal|Bone meal]] can be used on short dry grass to turn it into [[Tall Dry Grass|tall dry grass]].

=== Ambience ===
If placed on [[sand]], [[red sand]] or a [[terracotta]] block of any kind with at least one more corresponding block underneath it, short dry grass produces [[Ambience|ambient sounds]] reminiscent of dry leaves rustling, wind howling and insects rattling. These ambient sounds can play anywhere if the given conditions are met, and naturally play in the [[badlands]] and [[desert]] biomes due to the abundance of dry grass on top of said blocks.
