Compasses simply draw two lines over the item sprite to form the needle.

Much like clocks, the code responsible for moving the needle is also present with the "setup" code, however it is omitted here as it is not pertinent to the actual drawing of the sprite. Also like clocks, an oversight in how the compass sprite is set to be loaded prevents texture packs from overriding the compass's base sprite.

The generated compass sprite has 102 possible unique frames, while the pre-rendered compass has significantly less, at only 32 frames.
