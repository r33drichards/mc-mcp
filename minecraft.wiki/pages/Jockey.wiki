A '''jockey''' refers to a naturally-spawned [[mob]] [[riding]] another mob. The mob on the top often controls the mob on the bottom {{in|java}}, but sometimes does not control it {{in|bedrock}}.

Most jockeys are named based on the mob being ridden. The exceptions to the "jockey" naming scheme are the [[skeleton horseman]] and [[zombie horseman]].

== List of jockeys ==
* {{EntityLink|Camel Husk Jockey}}; a [[Camel Husk|camel husk]] ridden by a [[parched]] and a [[husk]] wielding a [[spear]].
* {{EntityLink|Chicken Jockey}}; a baby [[zombie]], [[Zombie Villager|zombie villager]], [[drowned]], [[husk]], or [[Zombified Piglin|zombified piglin]] riding a [[chicken]] or most adult mobs{{only|bedrock|short=1}}

** {{EntityLink|Cave Spider Jockey}}; a [[Cave Spider|cave spider]] ridden by said skeletons.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}

* {{EntityLink|id=chicken-jockey|Giant jockey}}; a chicken ridden by a [[giant]].{{only|je|short=1}}

Most jockeys spawn in similar conditions to their respective mobs, except for baby zombie (variant) riders {{in|bedrock}}, which can [[Jockey#Mounts|mount]] any mob.

== Mounting ==

15% of naturally spawned baby zombies, baby husks, baby zombie villagers,{{upcoming|be 26.0}} baby drowned,{{upcoming|be 26.0}} and baby zombified piglins{{upcoming|be 26.0}} search for a mount after spawning. Such a mob can be [[summoned]] with the <code>minecraft:as_baby_jockey</code> [[spawn event]]. 

The following mobs can be mounted:

{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s

In ''Bedrock Edition'', it requires two commands: 
# {{cmd|/summon chicken ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_adult}}
# {{cmd|/ride @e[type{{=}}chicken] summon_rider zombie minecraft:as_baby}}
Variants of zombies or ridden mobs can be summoned by replacing <code>chicken</code> and <code>zombie</code> respectively.
