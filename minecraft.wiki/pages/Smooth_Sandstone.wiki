'''Smooth sandstone''' is a variant of [[sandstone]], obtained by smelting.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Smooth sandstone can be mined with any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, the [[block]] drops nothing.

Despite regular sandstone having hardness and blast resistances of 0.8, smooth sandstone has a blast resistance of 6 and hardness of 2. This is likely due to historical reasons, specifically as a result of hardness being inherited from slab blocks,<ref>{{bug|MC-53641}}</ref> however the "correct"/"expected" values were changed to the "incorrect" values {{in|BE}}.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/27935763028237</ref>

=== Natural generation ===
Smooth sandstone generates in desert [[village]]s.

=== Smelting ===

== Usage ==
Unlike [[sand]], smooth sandstone is never affected by [[gravity]].

=== Stonecutting ingredient ===

=== Note blocks ===
Smooth sandstone can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Data history ===
==== ''Java Edition'' ====
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.5|dev=13w04a|Smooth sandstone exists as a metadata variant of the double slab block (block ID 43): if such a block had a metadata value from 8 to 15, it would use the top texture on all six sides. In practice, this affected stone slabs (creating [[smooth stone]]), sandstone slabs (creating this block) and quartz slabs (creating [[smooth quartz]]).
|Smooth sandstone existed as block 43, metadata 9.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w47a|The different <code>type</code> block states for the <code>double_stone_slab</code> IDs have been split up into their own IDs.
