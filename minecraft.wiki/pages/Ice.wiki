'''Ice''' is transparent [[block]] formed from frozen [[water]], which it can melt into if broken or exposed to bright [[light]]. Its top face is slippery for most [[entities]] and causes ridden [[boat]]s to move at high speeds.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Ice can be easily destroyed without [[tool]]s, but the use of a [[pickaxe]] speeds up the process. However, the block drops only when using a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. If mined without Silk Touch, the block drops nothing and instead is replaced with [[water]] if there is a block under the ice block.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Ice|Pickaxe|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Ice can be found naturally as part of the landscape in [[Biome#Snowy Biomes|snowy biomes]], from [[Frozen River|frozen rivers]], and [[Frozen Ocean|frozen oceans]] in which it replaces the top layer of water exposed to the sky. It also appears as part of the landscape in [[Ice Spikes|ice spikes]], [[Snowy Slopes|snowy slopes]], and [[Frozen Peaks|frozen peaks]] biomes. It can also be found in [[igloo]]s{{only|JE}}<ref>{{Bug|MC-100036|3=Igloo Window Melting|4=Working As Intended}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MCPE-146636|3=Igloos spawn with packed ice}}</ref> as a window and in the [[Ancient City/Structure|ice box]] of [[Ancient City|ancient cities]]. It most commonly appears at Y=62.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
==== Snowy biomes ====
{{see also|Tutorial:Ice farming|title1=Ice farming}}
[[Water]] source blocks in a snowy [[biome]] eventually freeze into ice if exposed to the sky from directly above, the [[block light]] level inside the water block is less than 10, and there is at least one horizontally adjacent non-water block. This includes non-solid blocks, even air, and it includes diagonally adjacent blocks; however, waterlogged blocks do not count. This can happen at any [[time of day]] and in any [[weather]] condition.

[[Water]] also freezes into ice in cold biomes with a [[Biome#List of biome climates|base temperature of ≤ 0.05]]{{info needed|Ice doesn't form in biomes with a 0.2 or greater base temperature. Ice forms in biomes with a base temperature of 0.05 or less. Is 0.05 the max base temperature, however?}}, as long as the [[altitude]] is high enough for [[snowfall]]. Ice does not form in [[Cold Ocean]], [[Deep Cold Ocean]], and [[Deep Frozen Ocean]] biomes.

Ice formation occurs as part of [[Tick#Chunk tick|chunk ticking]], so it requires a player to be nearby, similar to crop growth and grass spreading. The speed of ice formation is affected by the [[game rule]] <code>randomTickSpeed</code>.{{info needed|If the conditions are suitable, what is the chance to freeze?}}

==== Ice bomb ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|education|section=1}}

When an [[ice bomb]] is thrown into water, it transforms the water in a 3×3×3 cube centered around the projectile into ice. This affects source water and flowing water.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}
Despite being created by a 3×3 recipe, packed ice is not a storage block, because it cannot be crafted back into ice. The same applies to the next tier of compression, [[blue ice]].

=== Speed ===
Ice is slightly slippery, causing entities (excluding [[minecart]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-8265}}</ref>) to slide, including [[Item (entity)|items]]. This allows for increased speed of items in water currents, by placing ice blocks under the water current. Items already travel at high speeds in water currents because they float, so ice block water streams are less necessary for item transportation.

A player who [[sprint]]s and [[jump]]s repeatedly on ice travels faster than on any other block type. The player can travel even faster if they sprint and spam {{control|jump}} in a 2-block-high corridor with ice on the floor, allowing the player to accelerate to extremely high speeds, although this costs a lot of [[hunger]].

{{IN|java}}, when a non-full block is placed on top of ice, the block has the same "slipperiness" as the ice below it.<ref>{{bug|MC-1127|||WAI}}</ref>

==== Boat highway ====
Like other entities, [[boat]]s travel extremely quickly on ice and can reach a speed of 40 m/s, much faster than the 8 m/s speed on [[water]].<ref>{{bug|MC-97803||Boats going faster on ice than in water|WAI}}</ref> More beneficially, unlike water, ice can be placed in [[the Nether]], allowing players to construct boat highways made of ice or blue ice, to make use of the 1:8 distance travel ratio and travel at an equivalent speed of up to 320 m/s (720 mph or 1152 kph) between locations in the [[Overworld]]. Furthermore, using [[blue ice]] will make the boat move 1.8 times faster than normal ice.

=== Creating water ===
Ice can be used to create water either by its melting or being broken. If there is a [[movement-blocking]] block or any [[fluid]] directly underneath the ice block, the ice becomes a water source block when broken. 

Ice also melts into [[water]] if the [[block light]] level immediately next to it on any side is higher than 11, even if there is no block below it. [[Sky light]] level is ignored, therefore ice does ''not'' melt from [[sun]]light. {{IN|education|bedrock}}, ice also melts when near a [[heat block]], though heat blocks do not produce light. 

Compared to [[water bucket]]s, ice has the benefit of being able to stack in the inventory. Therefore, carrying ice instead of water buckets can be much more convenient, if the player wants to create a lot of water sources.

If ice melts or is broken in [[the Nether]], no water is produced. However, unlike from using a [[water bucket]], no smoke particles are produced either.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* By [[sprinting]] and jumping while on ice and inside a 2-block tall tunnel, it is possible to move 16 blocks a second, twice as fast as a full-speed [[minecart]]. By replacing the 2-block ceiling with [[trapdoor]]s, it's possible to travel 1000 blocks in 54 seconds, or 18.518 blocks per second. However, this drains the player's [[hunger]] bar extremely quickly at roughly 1 unit per second.
* [[Sugar cane]] can be generated next to ice, though they drop as items if updated. This can be observed at random when running through a snowy biome.
* Attempting to set ice on fire with a [[flint and steel]] causes no flames to appear, but the flint and steel's durability still decreases by 1.{{only|bedrock}} The same thing happens with [[glass]] and the sides of non-flammable blocks.
* Ice is classified as a transparent block and therefore does not conduct [[redstone]].
* [[Snow]] layers are the only transparent block that cannot be placed on ice.
* When a player holds an ice block, the normals of the smaller model are flipped inside out, giving a strange effect, as if the model was flipped upside-down.
