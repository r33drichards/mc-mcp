{{Merge|Bedrock Edition removed blocks|Removed blocks|reason=Having a section for removed blocks on the removed blocks page makes more sense than having a separate page. Whether a block is from Java Edition or Bedrock Edition can be stated on the page.}}

Due to there currently not being a wide variety of blocks removed from any edition, all such cases are listed on the main [[Removed blocks]] page. This page lists all {{el|je}} block ID conversions, as well as linking to diverse lists of removed data variants of blocks.

* [[/Metadata variants]] - Variants of blocks specified by metadata which have been removed
* [[/Metadata variants/Recontinued]] - Variants of blocks specified by metadata which eventually became used by intentionally-available blocks
* [[/Data variants]] - Variants of blocks specified by block entities and NBT
