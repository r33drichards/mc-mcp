'''Food''' refers to consumable [[item]]s that, when eaten, restore [[hunger]] and [[saturation]] points, sometimes giving [[status effect]]s. Food is essential for [[Survival]], since the player can [[Damage#Starvation|starve]] without it.

Food is eaten by holding {{control|use}} while having the food item selected in the hot bar or in the off-hand. All food items and ingredients can be stacked in the inventory slots, except for [[rabbit stew]], [[mushroom stew]], [[beetroot soup]], [[suspicious stew]], and [[cake]]{{only|Java}}.

== Mechanics ==
{{main|Food mechanics}}
{{seealso|Tutorial:Hunger management}}

[[File:Raw_and_Cooked_Chicken_Comparison.png|thumb|Raw (left) and cooked (right) [[chicken]]. Eating raw chicken can give the player [[food poisoning]].]]

[[Player]]s have two different food statistics, one of which is visible: The hunger level is visible, and the saturation level is not.

=== Saturation ===
{{main|Saturation}}
[[Saturation]] is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing. Although the current saturation level is generally hidden, the player can tell that their saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect.

Eating a food item restores a fixed number of saturation points at an amount dependent on the type of food consumed. Saturation represents the time until the hunger bar begins depleting. In {{JE}}, saturation is also used to replenish health faster, activating a saturation boost effect when reaching full hunger. A player's current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level.

=== Hunger ===
{{main|Hunger}}
[[Hunger]] is the second statistic to decrease when the player performs energy-intensive actions. When hunger is at least 18 ({{hunger|bar=18}}), the player's health regenerates. If it falls to 6 ({{hunger|bar=6}}), the player loses the ability to sprint. If the hunger bar is at zero, the player's health depletes due to [[starvation]].

Eating a food item restores a fixed number of hunger points at an amount dependent on the type of food consumed. In {{JE}} when reaching full hunger ({{hunger|bar=20}}), saturation boost activates which consumes saturation to heal faster.

== Usage ==
Any food, except [[cake]], can be eaten by hand, by {{control|using}} the food item in the main hand. It takes 1.61 seconds to eat most foods by hand, although dried kelp only takes 0.865 seconds to eat by hand. A player can hold and use food in their [[offhand]] {{in|Java}}.

Eating food by hand causes food [[particles]] to spew from the player's mouth, and produces a munching noise. The particles correlate with the respective food item. Eating also slows the user significantly.

Cake has to be eaten by placing it, then right-clicking on its block form. Eating a slice of cake is instant, and each cake has 7 edible slices. The cake becomes thinner as each slice is removed.

=== Nourishment value ===
Nourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full.

The nourishment table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios. See the more detailed [[#Foods|Foods]] table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food.
