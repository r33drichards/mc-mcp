A version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''June 8, 2010''' to fix bugs in the previous version of Infdev.<ref>[[wordofnotch:676989189|Infdev update with bug fixes]] – The Word of Notch, June 8, 2010</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* [[Entities]] now have shadows under them again.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Oak Door JE1.png|32px]] [[Door]]s'''
* [[Door]] rotation logic has been improved.

''' [[File:Lava JE8.png|32px]] [[Lava]] '''
* Texture changed from [[File:Lava JE9.png|32px]].

'''[[File:Oak Sign (0) JE1.png|32px]] [[Sign]]s'''
* [[Sign]]s can be mined much faster.
* They also drop themselves when destroyed now, instead of planks.

'''[[File:Water JE6.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Changed texture from [[File:Water JE7.png|32px]].

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed a duplication bug when a [[door]] was placed on [[glass]], [[slab]]s, [[ladder]]s, [[torch]]es, or [[sign]]s, causing it to immediately break and drop 2 doors.
* The [[particles]] signs give off while being mined are no longer from [[grass block]]s.
* The standard [[Steve]] skin now shows again, instead of a fully black skin when no skin was applied (with the exception of using a proxy debugger or some arguments).
* Placing two signs next to each other on slabs will no longer leave the player with a stack 0 sign. The game will still crash though.
* Doors now can not be placed on farmland (fixing the door on farmland bug).</onlyinclude>

== Bugs ==
'''1 bug reported'''
* Breaking a [[door]] by breaking its top part doesn't drop anything.
