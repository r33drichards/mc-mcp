'''Cod''' are common [[Bucket of aquatic mob|bucketable]] aquatic [[passive mob]]s found in [[ocean]]s, a source of [[raw cod]] and, occasionally, [[bone]]s{{Only|Bedrock}} or [[bone meal]].{{Only|Java}}

== Spawning ==

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
Cod [[Mob spawning|spawn]] underwater in normal, cold, and lukewarm oceans, and their deep variants, in groups of 3-6, subject to [[Fish#Spawning|fish spawning requirements]].

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Cod spawn underwater 12–32 blocks away from the [[player]] in normal, cold, frozen, lukewarm oceans, and their deep variants, in groups of 4–7. In addition, cod spawn only on the surface; that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top.

== Drops ==

* {{xp|1|3}} experience when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Cod tend to swim in schools with a maximum of 9 cod per school.

The player may collect a cod by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on it, which gives the player a [[bucket of cod]]. Cod placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When that fish bucket is {{control|used}} on a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the cod swimming in it. An empty bucket may be used as well.{{only|bedrock}}

Cod can not be bred, but only spawn in designated biomes.

=== Weaknesses ===
A cod cannot survive outside of water. Outside of water, they flip around on their sides like [[guardians]] for a while trying to get back into the water until, after 10 seconds of time, they start taking suffocation damage and die. {{IN|bedrock}}, fish out of water rotate while flipping. They cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.<ref>{{bug|MC-126819}} – "fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fills with water" resolved as "Won't Fix"</ref> They can swim in, but cannot survive in waterlogged blocks, most noticeably waterlogged slabs and stairs.

{{IN|java}}, cod are vulnerable to weapons that have the [[Impaling]] enchantment, which also affects other fish and aquatic mobs except drowned.
