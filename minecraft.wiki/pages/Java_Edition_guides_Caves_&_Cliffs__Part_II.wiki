=== Changed ===
{|{{Simple Guide table|Changed Structures}}
|-
|All [[structure]]s
|
|Now hardcoded into world generation.
|-
|General
|
|
* The Overworld now uses the multi-noise biome source type.
* Terrain generation is now independent from biomes, with biomes adapting to whatever terrain they happen to generate throughout.
** This allows for natural variation in the terrain of any individual biome, both in terms of shape and elevation.
*** For example, [[forest]]s and [[desert]]s could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that purpose.
** This additionally allows for smoother transitions between biomes.
* Terrain is now smoother and more extreme.
* Bedrock layers generate dependent on the world seed now.
* New random number generator is used for Overworld generation.
|-

|Generates with deepslate [[diamond ore]] instead of [[coal ore]] when below Y=0.
|-
|[[Lake]]s
|{{Animate|LavaLake.png;Aquifers_of_different_levels.jpg|184px}}
|

* Lava lakes now generate above Y=0.
|-
|[[Stony shore]]
|[[File:Stone_Shore.png|184px]]
|
* Now generates with strips of gravel.
* Can generate alongside any biome instead of just windswept hills.
|-
|[[Desert pyramid]]
