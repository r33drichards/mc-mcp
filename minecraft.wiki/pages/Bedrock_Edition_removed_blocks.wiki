{{Merge|Java Edition removed blocks|Removed blocks|reason=Having a section for removed blocks on the removed blocks page makes more sense than having a separate page. Whether a block is from Java Edition or Bedrock Edition can be stated on the page.}}

Due to there currently not being a wide variety of blocks removed from any edition, all such cases are listed on the main [[Removed blocks]] page. This page serves to link to a diverse list of removed data variants of blocks, which is subject to expansion.

* [[/Metadata variants]] - Variants of blocks specified by metadata which have been removed
