'''Invalid data value wooden slabs''' are item forms of the [[wooden slab]] block with damage values outside of the usual range which wooden slabs can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value wooden slabs are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Transmutation ===
[[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation#Door Transmutation|Block transmutation]] with doors can be used to obtain wooden slabs with metadata 6 to 7, and with arrows can be used to obtain blocks with metadata 6, 7, 14 and 15. These blocks can be mined in 14w21b or earlier{{verify}} to obtain wooden slabs with values 6 and 7.

== Usage ==
{{info needed section|Placement behavior.}}

=== Conversion to future versions ===
{{empty section}}

== History ==
{{HistoryTable

|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w17a|Proper wooden slabs have been added as a replacement for what would later become the [[petrified oak slab]]. Invalid data variants exist as a consequence of how item metadata is handled.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=1.7|Acacia and dark oak slabs have been properly implemented, taking up metadata values 4 and 5 and making these normally obtainable. The remaining invalid values are 6 and 7.}}

|Invalid data value wooden slab items now place the oak slab, rather than the block with a metadata value corresponding to the item's damage.
|Existing wooden slabs placed in the world with metadata 6, 7, 14 and 15 now drop the oak slab as an item, rather than the item corresponding to their metadata value.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w30a|Invalid data value wooden slabs, alongside other invalid data value items, now appear the size of a full block when held in third person or by another player or mob.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w31a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE2.png|32px}} The missing model's inventory appearance has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value wooden slabs also changing.

|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w43a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE3.png|32px}} The missing texture has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value wooden slabs also changing.}}

== Issues ==
Invalid data value wooden slabs ''are'' an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
