[[File:LCE_default_skin_pack.png|thumb|The Default Skin Pack on Legacy Console Edition]]

The '''Default Skin Pack''' is a [[skin pack]] consisting of 18 skins included by default in [[Legacy Console Edition]]. Most of the skins from this pack were later released {{in|bedrock}} as part of the [[Legacy Skin Pack]].

In Legacy Console Edition, if a player has not manually selected a skin to use, they are automatically assigned one of these skins, depending on the order they joined a game (player 1 is Steve, player 2 is Tennis Steve, player 3 is Tuxedo Steve, and so on).

In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Tennis Steve, Tennis Alex, Scottish Steve, and Swedish Alex appear as playable alternative costumes of Steve and Alex.
