'''In-game live events''', known officially as '''Live Events''', and internally as '''Gatherings''',<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.twitch.tv/cornerhard/clip/WiseCarelessTrufflePraiseIt-vyq0HfKDYST1g4Bx|title=Realms and Gatherings|author=CornerHard}}</ref> are public [[Server|multiplayer server]]s hosted by [[Mojang Studios]] for a limited amount of time in {{Edition|bedrock}}. Players have to login to a Microsoft or Xbox Live account in order to join the Live Event server<ref name="btfaq">{{Mcnet|better-together-faq|Better Together FAQ|July 31, 2017}}</ref> and all devices including consoles can join them just like [[featured servers]].

When a Live Event server is announced and opened, a dedicated button appears on the [[title screen]]. Upon clicking the button, the player is shown a screen with the server key art, a description, a button that redirects to a web page, and a button to join the event server. Live Event servers may also appear in the featured servers list.

== Safety ==
{{w|Xbox network}} is a social network for gamers, and servers require the players to have an Xbox account.<ref name="safety">{{Mcnet|minecraft-multiplayer-server-safety|How to Stay Safe Online|July 28, 2017}}</ref> Most of the event servers have the chat turned off, except for A Minecraft Movie Live Event and Capture the Flag.

== Trivia ==
* [[MINECON 2010]], which was organized by the community, took place as a server event on [[Java Edition Classic]].
