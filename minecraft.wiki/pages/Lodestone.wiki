A '''lodestone''' is a [[block]] that can be used to alter [[compass]]es to point toward it.

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
Lodestones require a [[pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining is slower and it drops nothing.

== Usage ==
=== Lodestone Compass ===
{{control|Using}} a [[compass]] on a lodestone causes the compass to point to the lodestone, indicated by an enchantment glint effect on the compass. This works even in [[the End]] and [[the Nether]]. If the lodestone is broken, or in a different dimension, then the compass spins randomly, as ordinary compasses in the End and Nether do. If the lodestone is destroyed while a paired compass is in a [[chest]], [[shulker box]], [[item frame]], [[armor stand]], or any other [[:Category:Storage|storage item]], the compass does not register that the lodestone is destroyed until the item is retrieved. Placing a lodestone back in the exact place as the original lodestone while the compass is still in a container prevents unpairing.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Lodestones cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[sticky piston]]s. It is one of the few blocks with that property that can be destroyed by explosions.

== Trivia == 
* In reality, a {{W|lodestone|newtab=1}} is a naturally magnetized piece of the mineral magnetite, which can attract iron.
* The advancement "Country Lode, Take Me Home" is a reference to the lyrics of the song "Take Me Home, Country Roads" by John Denver.
