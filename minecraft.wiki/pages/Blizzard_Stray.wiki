The '''Blizzard Stray''' (吹雪のストレイ, ''Fubuki no Suturei'') was a [[stray]] transfused with hatred against humans. It acted as a minor antagonist in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Blizzard Stray Closeup.png|thumb|left|100px|The rune over the Blizzard Stray's eye.]]
The Blizzard Stray largely resembled a regular [[stray]]. However, it had a [[Mod Power#Mod Rune|Mod Rune]] over its left eye, indicating that it possessed the [[Mod Power#Blizzard|Blizzard]] ability.

== Personality ==
The Blizzard Stray had little actual personality, being consumed with a pure hatred for all humans as a result of its captor's failed consciousness transfusion. It was motivated entirely by this hatred, and while it did not actively search for humans, it pursued those it encountered to the death.

Prior to the transfusion, the Blizzard Stray presumably had no personality, like other mindless mobs.{{-|left}}

== Powers and abilities==

As a [[stray]], the Blizzard Stray was a skilled archer, and its arrows granted the [[Slowness]] effect to anybody they hit. While largely immune to it due to its [[Mod Power]], it presumably also burned under the sun.

The Blizzard Stray possessed the Mod Power "[[Mod Power#Blizzard|Blizzard]]", causing it to create a constant blizzard for multiple kilometers around themselves at all times. This blizzard was powerful enough to stop virtually all adventurers who tried to cross through it, forcing them to give up or die.

== Biography ==
At some point in the past, the Blizzard Stray was captured by a man exiled from his village. Seeking immortality and noting the stray's ability to perpetually create blizzards, which kept it hidden from the sun even during the day, the man attempted to transfer his mind into the stray's body. However, the process failed, and the stray was simply left with a burning hatred for all humans, acquired from the man.

Eventually, [[Nico White]]'s party happened upon the mansion where the Blizzard Stray resided. Due to its hatred of humans, the stray attacked them, chasing them out into the blizzard before falling victim to one of [[Navy (character)|Navy]]'s explosions, killing it and ending the storm.
