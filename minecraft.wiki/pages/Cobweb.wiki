A '''cobweb''' is a [[block]] that drastically slows down the movement of most [[Entity|entities]] touching it. The [[Weaving]] effect lessens this movement speed decrease.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cobwebs can be obtained as an item using [[shears]]. Cobwebs can also be obtained with a sword enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], which is possible only through commands or while in Creative mode{{only|JE|short=1}}. A cobweb drops one piece of [[string]] if broken with a non-Silk Touch sword, if [[water]] touches or flows over it, or a [[piston]] pushes it. Breaking cobwebs costs two durability on a sword. It drops nothing when broken using anything else, or if [[lava]] flows over it.

=== Natural generation ===
Cobwebs generate naturally in [[mineshaft]]s, [[stronghold]] libraries, [[igloo]] basements, [[abandoned village]]s, [[woodland mansion]] spider spawner rooms, and [[trial chambers]] around specific [[trial spawner]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
When an [[entity]] with the [[Weaving]] effect dies, 2-3 cobwebs can generate in a 3×3×3 cube centered on the entity's location of death. The cobwebs can generate only on top of blocks with a full top face, meaning that cobwebs cannot generate on top of other cobwebs. When the [[game rule]] {{cd|mobGriefing}} is set to {{cd|false}}, entities excluding the player do not generate cobwebs upon death.

== Usage ==
[[Mob]]s can spawn inside of cobwebs. Cobwebs also diffuse sky [[light]]. [[Undead]] mobs do not catch fire from sunlight if they are under a cobweb or their head is inside a cobweb. 

Blocks can be placed on cobwebs. [[Painting]]s{{only|java}} and [[sign]]s can be placed on their sides, or on top in the case of signs.

Despite being slowed down by them, mobs do not try to pathfind around cobwebs, which can be exploited to construct clever mob traps.

=== Redstone circuits ===
[[File:Cobweb delay.png|thumb|2 cobwebs delay for around a minute]]

Cobwebs can be used as a delaying mechanism in a redstone circuit, for example, to delay an item falling on a [[pressure plate]] or into a [[hopper]]. They can also be used to cancel random momentum of an item thrown from a [[dispenser]] or [[dropper]] by placing them directly on their face.

=== Effects ===
All mobs except for [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, [[shulker]]s and [[vex]]es experience slow movement through a cobweb and, if affected by gravity, fall approximately 0.078 blocks/second while within it, taking nearly 13 seconds to fall 1 full block. A cobweb can partially stop blast damage if a player/[[entity]] and another entity causing the [[explosion]] are both caught in the cobweb.

Cobwebs halt [[Item (entity)|item entities]]' horizontal momentum completely and make item entities fall around twice as slow as mobs do, taking ~27 seconds to fall 1 full block. [[Experience|Experience orbs]], on the other hand, would fall approximately ~2.54x slower than mobs, taking ~33 seconds.

A cobweb affects the [[player]]'s movement abilities, as well. While in contact with it, the player can move at a speed of about 25% of the normal [[Player#Movement|walking]] speed, and their [[jumping]] height is severely reduced. A cobweb also limits the rate at which a player can [[break]] blocks. Like [[water]], falling into a cobweb prevents a player from taking [[fall damage]], meaning a fatal fall can be mitigated with cobwebs. Attacking while falling through cobwebs counts as a [[critical hit]], the same as when falling after a jump.

Players and mobs affected by the [[Weaving]] effect move through cobwebs at 50% of their normal speed instead of 25%.

The slowing effect of the cobweb increases if it is placed on [[ice]]. The slowest a player can move in vanilla ''Minecraft'' without commands or other third-party tools is by placing cobwebs on [[blue ice]], [[sneaking]], drinking a level IV [[Turtle Master potion]], and [[blocking]], which causes the player come to a near-total standstill, moving only a single block every few minutes.

[[Item]]s thrown into a cobweb are slowed and fall through it after a maximum of about 24 seconds depending on where it enters. They do not merge with other items of the same type thrown on the ground.

Cobwebs have different effects on other moving [[entities]]. An [[arrow]] shot at a cobweb passes through without being slowed. {{IN|java}}, a [[falling block]] that enters a cobweb slows down, then drops as an item after existing for 30 seconds.

A [[minecart]] with no players in it takes about 9 seconds to fall through a cobweb if a [[rail]] is placed directly under the cobweb, however, if there is air between the cobweb and the rail, the minecart takes about 34 seconds to fall. Every extra cobweb added gives an additional 25 seconds of falling time. Players are unaffected by cobwebs when in a minecart unless they come into direct contact.
