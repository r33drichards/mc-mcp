'''End stone''' is a [[block]] that appears in [[the End]] and, apart from [[Structure|generated structure]]s, makes up all of the solid ground that exists in that dimension.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
End stone can be obtained using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:TheEnd.png|300px|thumb|right|A large island consisting entirely of End stone.]]

End stone is found only in [[the End]], where it makes up all the floating islands that generate in the dimension.

=== Post-generation ===
==== Exit portal ====
The 16 End stone blocks under the edge of the [[exit portal]] are replaced when the [[ender dragon]] is respawned, and again when it is killed. Because [[end crystal]]s, which are used to respawn the dragon, are [[Renewable resource|renewable]], this makes End stone renewable as well.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[End gateway]]s generate a small floating island of End stone when an [[entity]] travels through, for the entity to land on if there are no valid locations.

If an exit portal exists at a different position from the world origin (for example, an old exit portal from before 1.9), it is completely converted into End stone if the ender dragon is re-summoned.

== Usage ==
End stone has a [[blast resistance]] of 9, which is 3 more than that of ordinary [[stone]]. This is the highest blast resistance of any block movable by pistons besides [[anvil]]s{{only|BE}}, [[ancient debris]], and [[netherite block]]s.

It cannot be picked up by [[endermen]] nor destroyed by the [[ender dragon]].

It is the only block on which [[chorus flower]]s can be planted.

=== Note blocks ===
End stone can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sound.

=== Sculk catalyst interactions ===
End stone can be replaced by sculk via [[sculk catalyst]]s.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* End stone's texture is an inversion, geometric translation, and recoloration of the [[cobblestone]] texture. (Specifically, the texture is shifted 3 pixels up, and 8 pixels to the right.)
* In the descriptions for several [[Youtooz]] figures, end stone is consistently referred to as "soul stone."<ref>[https://youtooz.com/products/minecraft-enderman Enderman - Youtooz Collectibles]</ref><ref>[https://youtooz.com/products/ender-dragon Ender Dragon - Youtooz Collectible]</ref>
* In a [[Block of the Week]] article, [[Jens Bergensten]] remarked he wanted to think of some sort of "fabled history" for the block, but struggled to think of anything worthwhile.<ref>{{Mcnet|block-week-end-stone|Block of the Week: End Stone|May 5, 2017|[[Marsh Davies]]}}</ref>
