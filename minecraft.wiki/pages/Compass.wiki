A '''compass''' is an [[item]] that points in the horizontal direction of the [[Overworld]]'s spawn point. 

A '''lodestone compass''' is a compass variant that is obtained by {{Control|use|text=using}} a compass or lodestone compass on a [[lodestone]], and instead points toward that lodestone's horizontal position.

If the target position of either type of compass is in a different dimension, or is a lodestone that has been broken, it spins in random directions.

== Usage ==
Both types of compass normally point in the horizontal direction of a specific position in the world and do so when viewed in most ways; including in the inventory, when held by any [[player]] or [[entity]] or displayed in an [[Item Frame|item frame]]. They also point toward their target position when viewed in the [[Crafting Table|crafting table]] preview menu, even without being crafted.{{Only|Bedrock}} The direction of the needle is relative to the player viewing it.

Normal compasses point toward the [[world spawn]] point in the [[Overworld]]. Using the {{cmd|setworldspawn}} command to change the world spawn can change where normal compasses point.

If a compass or lodestone compass is {{Control|use|text=used}} on a [[lodestone]], it becomes a lodestone compass that points toward that lodestone. Compasses and lodestone compasses do not [[stack]] together, and only lodestone compasses that point toward the same lodestone stack together. All lodestone compasses have an [[enchanted|enchantment]] visual effect to distinguish them from normal compasses.

A compass or lodestone compass spin and point in random directions if it cannot find its target position. There are two causes for this:

* If the compass is in a different dimension to its target position (e.g. a lodestone compass is in the Overworld but its target lodestone is in the [[The Nether|Nether]]), its needle spins randomly. Because of this, normal compasses only work in the Overworld (as their target position is the Overworld spawn point) and always spins randomly in the Nether and [[The End|End]].
* If a lodestone compass's target lodestone is broken, it spins randomly, even if the lodestone is replaced in the same position. The only way to 'fix' a 'broken' lodestone compass is to {{Control|use|text=use}} it on any lodestone to make it point toward it. However, if a lodestone compass is placed in a storage block, the lodestone can be broken and replaced without causing the compass to spin randomly, as long as the compass remains in storage while the lodestone is missing.

{{IN|JE}}, uncrafted compasses viewed in the crafting table preview always points straight forward and never at any particular position in the world.
