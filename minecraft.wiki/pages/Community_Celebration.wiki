'''Community Celebration''' was an event that took place between December 8, 2020 and January 13, 2021. During the event, players were able to claim and download four worlds made by the community for free, as well as new [[Character Creator]] items, for {{BE}}. Players on {{JE}} were also able to redeem free content, as well as a free week of [[Realms]]. The content was made by community creators [https://twitter.com/PixelHeadsTeam PixelHeads], [[Noxcrew]], [[Gamemode One]], [https://twitter.com/Mitheyx Mithey], and [[Jigarbov Productions]]. [[Mojang Studios]] ran the event in order to thank the community for investing time and talent into the game.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/article/it-s-time-community-celebration|title=It's time for a Community Celebration!|author=Sofia Dankis|website=Minecraft.net|date=December 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>https://minecraft.net/minecraft-community-celebration</ref><ref>https://minecraft.net/minecraft-java-community-celebration</ref>
