The '''Before Times''' were an era pivotal to the story of ''[[Minecraft: The Outsider]]''. A historical period predating recorded history, where humanity was forced to fend for themselves in an empty world overrun with monsters.

== Biography ==
{{Expand section|Further information from later chapters}}
The Before Times consisted of several centuries, so many that the Before Times' beginning "can't be counted". At some point, humans emerged in the [[Overworld]], lacking any inherent resources. As they scavenged and created, they came into conflict with several hostile mobs, such as [[zombie]]s, [[slime]]s, [[creeper]]s, and [[endermen]].

== Aftermath ==
At an unknown time, many humans came together and created [[the City]], a solution to many of the problems faced during the Before Times. In the centuries that followed, their original struggles became a distant memory, many in doubt they ever had to deal with such hurdles. Many children became fascinated by these stories, [[Jeremy|some]] trying to read up on them at the City library, others pretending they were alive at the time.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|The Before Times were before The City was made. Years and years ago. Centuries ago. So far back people couldn’t count it anymore. Back then the people of the Overworld lived like barbarians, as if they’d just been plunked into a newly created world and had to take care of everything themselves. If they needed a home, they couldn’t buy one with their emeralds. Instead, they had to punch trees and use that wood to create a home. Without stores and structures all around them, they did their own farming and made their own tools and weapons.|The first explanation of the Before Times}}

== Trivia ==
* The description of the Before Times heavily mirrors the gameplay of [[survival]], presumably meant to evoke a survival [[multiplayer]] [[server]].
