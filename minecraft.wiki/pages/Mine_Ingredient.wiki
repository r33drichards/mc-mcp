The '''mine ingredient''' is an item introduced in [[25w14craftmine]] that can be used to create a [[Mine (item) (April Fools' joke)|mine]] and add effects and features to it.

== Obtaining ==
Mine Ingredients can be obtained in Survival mode by doing certain tasks. Exiting a mine with a Mine Ingredient in the inventory unlocks it in the [[mine crafter]] menu.

If a Mine Ingredient is obtained in the [[Hub]] (through commands or using the rooms behind [[shimmering door]]s), it can be obtained by right-clicking the Mine Crafter.

It can also be obtained with this command: 

{{Cmd|1=/give @s minecraft:mine_ingredient[minecraft:world_modifiers={effects : [<mine_ingredient_identifier>], include_description:1b}, minecraft:world_effect_unlock={}]}} 

where <code><mine_ingredient_identifier></code> is the identifier of the wanted mine ingredient.

== Usage ==
The mine ingredient is used as an ingredient in the [[mine crafter]]. Each ingredient added to a mine using the Mine Crafter will alter the generation of the mine in the described way.

It is not possible to add mine ingredients to special event mines.

Even though it is not shown, it can still be obtained; when a player unlocks it, a message confirming that will still be displayed in the chat.

|<code>soul_link</code>
|Every player takes damage if one player is hurt
|Any damage taken by a player is shared between all players in a world (bugged){{note|When the server-side function <code>hurtServer</code> is called on a player and Soul Link is active, it will call all other players' <code>hurtServer</code> functions as well. However, an oversight means that these calls to <code>hurtServer</code> ''also'' call all other players' <code>hurtServer</code> functions (and so on to infinity), which quickly causes a [[w:Stack_overflow|stack overflow]]; this means the server crashes if any player takes damage while Soul Link is active.}}
