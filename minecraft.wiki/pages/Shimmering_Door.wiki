'''Shimmering door''' is a block added in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Obtaining ==
The shimmering door is unobtainable in Survival mode, however it generates at the [[hub]] upon creating a world. Two shimmering doors can be found on the east and west sides of the [[hub]].

== Usage ==
When interacted with normally, a message reads: "Doors yearn for keys!" The door does not open in this scenario.

Shimmering doors can be opened with a [[shimmering key]], which consumes the key upon usage. This creates another room in the hub world. The type of room is determined by the key. These rooms can then lead to more shimmering doors, allowing the player to unlock more rooms.
