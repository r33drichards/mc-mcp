A '''farm''' is a [[Village/Structure|generated structure]] in a [[village]] used for growing various crops.

== Generation ==
Farms generate naturally in [[village]]s. All farms generate with [[farmland]] blocks, [[water]], and at least one [[composter]] (with rare exceptions). Most farms generate with crops, mostly [[wheat]], but [[melon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[carrot]]s may also be found.

In addition, village farm plots have a 20% chance to generate with [[potato]]es planted, and a 10% chance to generate with [[beetroot]] planted.

== Post-generation ==
{{see also|Farmland}}
A player may create a working crop farm in any biome in the [[Overworld]] or [[The End]]. A farm needs [[farmland]] blocks, which are created by {{control|using}} a [[hoe]] on [[dirt]] blocks. Given sufficient light, [[seeds]] or other crops may then be planted on the farmland and grown to maturity for harvesting. While crops can grow on dry farmland, hydrating the farmland blocks with a nearby [[water]] source block increases the growth rate of the crops.

== Use ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Crop farming}}
While a village farm is a good ready-made source of food, a village is not required for farming crops. A player with access to [[water]], [[dirt]] or [[grass block]]s, and a [[hoe]] may create a farm anywhere.

For a typical early-game [[survival]] farm, a player uses a hoe to create [[farmland]] within four blocks of water, and then plants [[seeds]] that were harvested from breaking [[tall grass]]. The seeds eventually grow into [[wheat]] after a few day-night cycles. Once the crops have matured, they can be harvested and then used for [[food]], [[trading]], leading livestock, [[breeding]] livestock, or [[Villager#Breeding|breeding villagers]].

[[Farmer]] villagers use a farm's [[composter]] as a [[job site]]. Farmer villagers can also be seen occasionally harvesting crops.

== Structure ==
[[File:Tinyfarm.png|thumb|right|A naturally-generated tiny farm in a savanna village.]]
<div class="nomobile">Farms generate in different configurations depending on the biome. Some farms have irregular shapes that can vary from the configurations shown below. As seen on the right, it is possible for a minimal farm to generate naturally with one water block and eight farmland blocks.</div><div class="mobileonly">Farms generate in different configurations depending on the biome. Some farms have irregular shapes that can vary from the configurations shown below. As seen above, it is possible for a minimal farm to generate naturally with one water block and eight farmland blocks.</div>

The crops are stored as wheat blocks, which are then replaced by biome specific crops in a processor during world generation. The processor goes through each possible crop sequentially, so each subsequent crop is rolled only if the previous crops did not get replaced.

As shown in the sections below, additional resources that make up the structure are available beyond the farmland, water, and composter blocks found in all farms.

=== Desert ===
There are three variants of farms found in desert villages:
<gallery widths="200px">
Desert Farm 1.png|Three patches of farmland divided by two irrigation canals and a [[composter]].
Desert Farm 2.png|Farmland with an offset composter surrounded by jungle trapdoors.
Desert Large Farm 1.png|Large farm surrounded by hay bales, two composters, and a water channel made of smooth sandstone.

{{in|be}}, these structures also generate in the snowy taiga village variant, and are topped with snow layers wherever there is sky access.
