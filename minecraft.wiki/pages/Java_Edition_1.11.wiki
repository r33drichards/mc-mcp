* Can be [[dye]]d in any of the available dye colors.
** Dyed shulker boxes have a slightly darker bottom part than the normal one.

** Brings it into line with the new privacy policy<ref name="new_privacy_policy">{{cite|url=http://www.mojang.com/2016/09/weve-just-updated-our-privacy-policy/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2016/09/weve-just-updated-our-privacy-policy/|title=We’ve just updated our privacy policy!|author=Marsh Davies|website=Mojang.com|date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>
** Title is now "Feed us data!" instead of "Machine Specs Collection"
** Description is now "We always want to improve Minecraft and, to help us do that, we'd like to collect some information. This lets us know what hardware to support and where the big problems are. It also gives us a sense of the size of our active player base, so we know if we're doing a good job. You can view all the information we collect below. If you want to opt out then you can simply toggle it off!"

'''Entity IDs, block entity IDs, block IDs and item IDs'''
* Now are no longer case sensitive.
** Autocompletion puts in lowercase letters.

'''Entity and block entity IDs'''
* Use underscores to separate words, rather than using single words in mixed case.
* Optionally, a <code>minecraft:</code> namespace prefix can be used, just like block and item IDs. However, it is not optional for EntityTags and spawners.<ref>{{bug|MC-106199}} – ''"minecraft:" is not optional for entity ID in EntityTag and Spawners'' – resolved 'Works as Intended'.</ref>
* There are still old entity IDs in the language files (example: <code>LavaSlime</code> instead of <code>magma_cube</code> for the [[magma cube]]) and the new mobs in 1.11 have their ID with the old type (no underscores, capital letters for the beginning of the words. example: <code>VindicationIllager</code> instead of <code>vindication_illager</code> for the [[vindicator]].)
* The following names have changed:
