A '''small fireball''' is a [[fire charge]] launched as a [[projectile]] that deals burning [[damage]] and can start [[fire]]s. They are used by [[blaze]]s as their ranged attack, and cannot be thrown by hand.

== Behavior ==
[[Blaze]]s shoot small fireballs in volleys of three at a time as their ranged attack. When a fire charge is fired from a dispenser, it also shoots a small fireball.

Small fireballs, when fired either by dispensers or blazes, fly in a straight line through the air. There is a random offset in a small fireball's trajectory due to a 'cone' of spread, which can cause small fireballs to miss their target or hit something else.{{Needs testing|Exact details of cone of spread and inaccuracy needed.}}

Fireballs shot from dispensers start out stationary and accelerate, while fireballs shot by blazes maintain the same speed.

A small fireball flies indefinitely until it hits a block or an entity, even if it is outside the player's render distance.

If a small fireball hits a block, [[fire]] is placed at that location if possible. It produces no [[Explosion|explosive]] effect. Small fireballs can light [[campfire]]s and [[nether portal]]s and can prime [[minecarts with TNT]].

If it hits an [[entity]] that is not immune to fire and does not have the [[Fire Resistance]] effect, the entity takes {{hp|5}} of projectile damage regardless of [[difficulty]] level. The target is set on fire for 5 seconds, which does an additional {{hp|4}} fire damage over time; it can deal up to {{hp|9}} damage from these combined effects.

A small fireball cannot be deflected by melee attacks or arrows, unlike regular [[fireball]]s. However, it can be blocked by [[shield]]s, which prevents the player from being damaged and catching fire.

== Sounds ==
{{Edition|Java}}:<br>
Small fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Small fireballs share the same texture as regular fireballs, visually differing primarily in size.
* Dispensers with fire charges can shoot through blocks directly in front of them, as long as they’re not higher or wider than half a block.
