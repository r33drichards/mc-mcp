A '''snowball''' is an [[item]] obtained by breaking [[snow block]]s or [[snow layer]]s using a [[shovel]]. It can be [[craft]]ed into snow blocks, thrown to knock [[mob]]s back, fed to [[ghastling]]s and used to attract [[happy ghast]]s.

== Obtaining ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Snow farming}}

=== Mining ===
A [[shovel]] without the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment can get 4 snowballs by breaking a [[snow block]], and 1–8 snowballs by breaking or blasting [[snow layer]]s – one per layer. The [[Fortune]] enchantment does not affect these amounts.

==== Explosions ====
Creeper and TNT [[explosion]]s leave snowballs in the resulting debris field if near snow.

==== Ravagers ====
{{IN|BE}}, Ravagers destroy snow layers, dropping snowballs.

==== Pistons ====
{{IN|BE}}, a block or piston head pushed into the position of snow layers destroys the snow layers, dropping snowballs: 1–3 layers drop 1 snowball, 4–5 layers drop 2 snowballs, 6–7 layers drop 3 snowballs, and 8 layers drop 4 snowballs.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Snow golem]]s drop 0–15 snowballs upon death, unaffected by [[Looting]].

=== Combat ===
[[File:Throwing a snowball on a pig.gif|300px|thumbnail|right|Animation of throwing a snowball at a pig.]]
Snowballs can be thrown by {{control|using}} them. There is no charging time or cooldown for firing them,{{Until|java Combat Tests|nocat=1}} meaning they can be thrown as fast as the player can click.

Like other projectiles, snowballs are affected by gravity: their range is the same as those of [[egg]]s and [[ender pearl]]s, less than that of [[arrow]]s fired from [[bow]]s, and more than that of [[splash potion]]s.

Snowballs deal {{hp|3}} each to [[blaze]]s, but they deal no damage to other mobs. Mobs still receive knockback and act the same as if they were being hit by any other projectile (for example, [[zombified piglin]]s who are hit by snowballs become aggressive). Players {{in|BE}} receive knockback, while players {{in|JE}} are unaffected.<ref>{{bug|MC-3179|||WAI}}</ref>{{Until|java Combat Tests|nocat=1}}

When fighting the [[ender dragon]], [[end crystal]]s can be destroyed by snowballs being thrown at them.

Snowballs, like other projectiles, can be used to distract the [[warden]]. A warden walks toward the location where the snowball lands to inspect it, giving the player time to escape. However, if snowballs are fired too frequently (at least twice in 5 seconds), the warden walks straight to the player instead.

{{IN|BE}}, snowballs thrown through fire or lava catch fire, and set fire to entities they hit.

=== Mob interaction ===
Snowballs can be fed to [[ghastling]]s to speed up their growth, in which they become a [[happy ghast]]. Whilst holding a snowball, both ghastlings and happy ghasts will be attracted towards the player.

== Behavior ==
{{#lst:Ender Pearl|thrownball}}

== Sounds ==
{{Edition|Java}}:<br>
Thrown snowballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

== Trivia ==
* A thrown snowball faces the player in the first-person view, while it appears horizontally rotated in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable items ([[ender pearl]]s, [[egg]]s, snowballs, and all throwable [[potion]]s).
