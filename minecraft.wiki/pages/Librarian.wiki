A '''librarian''' is a [[villager]] that [[trade]]s [[enchanted book]]s, [[glass]], [[bookshelves]] and [[name tag]]s. Librarians wear a red book as a hat, glasses, and a white robe.

== Spawning ==
An unemployed [[villager]] turns into a librarian when an unclaimed [[lectern]] is nearby.

=== Natural generation ===
{{Main|Villager#Spawning}}
The workstation of librarians, or the [[lectern]], generates in libraries in [[village]]s.

== Drops ==
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
{{Main|Hero of the Village#Gifts}}
{{IN|java}}, a librarian can drop a [[book]] by throwing it as a gift towards a nearby player with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.

== Trading ==

It is possible for a librarian to sell the same book more than once.
The price in emeralds depends on the enchantment level and "treasure" status. The minimum price of a book is given by 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;*&nbsp;(enchantment level), while the maximum price is 6&nbsp;+&nbsp;13&nbsp;*&nbsp;(enchantment level). The possible values are 5–19 emeralds for Lvl I, 8–32 for Lvl II, 11–45 for Lvl III, 14–58 for Lvl IV, and 17–71 for Lvl V. For [[treasure enchantment]]s the price is doubled. The cost is capped at 64 emeralds. All values below this cap are equally probable.}}

==== Villager Trade Rebalance ====
{{experimental|JE|BE|je=Villager Trade Rebalance|be=Villager Trade Rebalancing|section=1}}
If the [[Villager Trade Rebalance]] [[experiment]] is turned on, librarians offer specific enchanted books depending on which biome they come from. Enchantments for the Novice, Apprentice, and Journeyman book trades are randomly selected from the "Common" pool, with a randomized level. At Master level, librarians are guaranteed to sell an enchanted book with a specific enchantment.
