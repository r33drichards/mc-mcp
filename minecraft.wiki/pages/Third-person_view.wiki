'''Third-person view''' allows the [[player]] to view the nearby environment from an "outside" perspective.

== Usage ==
Different perspectives can be toggled by [[Controls|pressing]] {{key|F5}} when using a keyboard, or {{Xbutton|seriesdpad-up}} when using a controller. Pressing it once displays the back of the player, and pressing it again displays the front. Pressing it once more reverts to first-person view.

{{IN|be}}, it can be changed in the settings, or when "Show camera perspective button" toggle is enabled for touch control. In the mobile version of {{El|china}}, it can be changed by pressing the Fold button, which shows multiple buttons to change between perspectives.

When in third-person view, the player can be viewed from an angle of 0 degrees (Y axis) when the mouse is leveled with the ground, up to an angle of 90 degrees when looking straight down toward the player. {{IN|je}}, if the player suffocates while in this mode, the camera doesn't automatically switch back to the first-person view.<ref>{{ytl|Mb3S-MuvICA|Does 3PV reset back to FPV when suffocating? [MC JE 1.20.4]|Le Sharkoïste|January 17, 2024}}</ref>

A third-person front view can also be seen while the [[survival]] [[inventory]] is open; the player, in this case, always faces the cursor.

The third-person view camera has a [[Hitbox#Third-person view camera collision box|collision]] that collides with [[solid block]]s, except non-solid and [[transparent]] blocks. This can obstruct the player's vision with a close-up view in some situation where solid blocks are placed behind or in front of the player.

The third-person camera is positioned 4 blocks from the player's front/back by default, and 8 blocks from a player riding a [[happy ghast]]. {{IN|je}}, the third-person view camera's position can be changed by modifying the {{attr|camera_distance}} attribute. It controls how far the camera's position from the player's front or back, or while [[spectating]] an [[entity]] in third-person view. {{IN|be}}, it can be controlled by using {{cmd|camera}} command, which allows extensive customization of the camera's view.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Third-person view|Third person|Third-person}}

== Trivia ==

* {{IN|BE}}, the third-person view allows the player to reach further than in first-person, and behind them when using touch controls.
* In older versions of {{LCE}}, the third-person front view looked up and down with your character before eventually being updated to match {{JE}}.
