== Description ==
The very rare snowy taiga mountains featured much steeper terrain than the [[snowy taiga hills]], but not as mountainuous as the [[Windswept Hills|windswept hills]]. Similarly to the [[taiga mountains]], this variant reached high elevations. The steep elevations made this biome difficult for survival. Structures didn't generate here. Although this was a snowy biome, [[River|rivers]] generated inside snowy taiga mountains were not replaced by [[Frozen River|frozen rivers]].

Because snowy taigas were already very rare, this biome variant was the third rarest in the game, behind the [[Modified Badlands Plateau|modified badlands plateau]] and the [[Modified Jungle Edge|modified jungle edge]].

== Mobs ==
Snowy taiga mountains used the same mob spawning chances as snowy taigas. 

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
