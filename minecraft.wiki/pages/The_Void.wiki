'''The Void''' is an empty [[biome]] which generates the [[void start platform]]. It is used by the "The Void" [[superflat]] preset {{in|java}}, and can be set in a [[single biome]] world as well. The void biome only exists {{in|java}}; {{in|bedrock}}, the "The Void" flat world preset is set to the [[plains]] biome, but generates identically as in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
=== Superflat ===
The [[superflat]] preset "The Void" uses this biome. Preset generates only a 33×33 [[void start platform]] centered on a block of cobblestone at coordinates X=8, Y=-61, Z=8, 3 blocks above the bottom of the world. Since the world is made up of one layer of [[air]], only the platform generates. Below the platform, there is just [[void]], and above the platform, there is just [[sky]].

=== Single biome world ===
If the Void is chosen for a [[single biome]] world, terrain generates the same as if using [[Default]] world option, but without any [[structure]]s or [[feature]]s. The void start platform does generate on the same coordinates as in the superflat world, which puts it inside of the bedrock layers at the bottom of the world.

Such a world consists almost entirely out of just nine blocks:
* {{BlockLink|Air}},
* {{BlockLink|Water}},
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}},
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}},
* {{BlockLink|Gravel}},
* {{BlockLink|Stone}},
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate}},
* {{BlockLink|Lava}},
* {{BlockLink|Bedrock}}.

Only [[terrain feature]]s can generate in this world. They include [[caves]] and [[ore vein]]s. Thanks to ore veins, an additional six blocks generate naturally:
* {{BlockLink|Granite}},
* {{BlockLink|Copper Ore}},
* {{BlockLink|Block of Raw Copper}},
* {{BlockLink|Tuff}},
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Iron Ore}},
* {{BlockLink|Block of Raw Iron}}.

Occasionally, water and lava can form [[obsidian]] and [[cobblestone]] (and there is one additional cobblestone in the center of the start platform). These seventeen blocks in total represent 100% of the natural terrain in this world.

=== Usage ===
This biome can be useful for constructing a redstone contraptions world without interference from the surroundings. It can also be useful for building completely custom terrain from scratch.

Because void doesn't generate in a default world, visiting it is not required for any [[advancement]].

== Mobs ==
No [[mob]]s apart from [[phantom]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-127599||Phantoms can spawn in the void biome}}</ref> and [[pillager patrol]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-226384||Pillager patrols can spawn in the void biome}}</ref> can spawn naturally. Not even [[wandering trader]]s spawn in this biome. However, other types of mob spawning occur as usual, such as [[zombified piglin]]s spawning from [[nether portal]]s or [[monster spawner]]s spawning any mob.
