'''[[Sculk Sensor]]'''
* Vibration frequencies of many actions in the game have been tweaked and greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference, as following:
: {| class="wikitable"
! Action
! Frequency Value
|-
| Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
| 1
|-
| Landing on any surface (land or water)
| 2
|-
| Item interactions
| 3
|-
| Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
| 4
|-
| Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
| 5
|-
| Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
| 6
|-
| Mobs and players getting damaged
| 7
|-
| Consuming items (drinking and eating)
| 8
|-
| Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
| 9
|-
| Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
| 10
|-
| Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc)
| 11
|-
| Blocks being destroyed
| 12
|-
| Blocks being placed
| 13
|-
| Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
| 14
|-
| Mobs and players dying or an explosion
| 15
|}
*Sculk Sensors now have three phases: Inactive, Active, and Cooldown
*The default phase is Inactive
**This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration
**During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled
*When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase
**This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
**During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils, and emits a Redstone signal and light
*After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase
**This phase lasts for 10 game ticks
**During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a Redstone signal nor light
**Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase
*Previously, these phases had different timings:
**The Active phase lasted 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors
**There was no Cooldown phase
*These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them.

=== General ===
'''[[Death screen]]'''
* Reverted changes when the "Show Coordinates" setting is enabled.

'''[[Experiments]]'''
* Removed the "Sniffer" experimental toggle.

**{{cd|content-log-level}} - Sets the minimum level for content logs to output. Allowed values: {{cd|verbose}}, {{cd|info}}, {{cd|warning}}, {{cd|error}}. Default: {{cd|info}}.
***Note: This log level also affects content logs written to disk when using {{cd|content-log-file-enabled<nowiki>=</nowiki>true}}.
**{{cd|content-log-console-output-enabled}} - Enables or disables content log output to the console window. Default: {{cd|info}}.

'''[[Entities]]'''
*Custom entities with internal-only components or AI goals will fail to load in game.
*Custom entities are restricted to overriding Vanilla entities released before 1.20. Invalid entities used in the {{cd|identifier}} or {{cd|runtime_identifier}} field will result in content errors.

'''General'''
*Added {{cd|spawn_item_event}} event to {{cd|minecraft:spawn_entity}}. This event is called when an item is spawned.

* Items with the entity placer item component will now successfully create the actor on air blocks if the {{cd|dispense_on}} field is empty.

'''[[Molang]]'''
* There is now a limit on the amount of nested sub-expressions each molang expression can have.

=== Additions ===
==== Command format ====
'''{{cmd|camera}}'''
* A new [[command]] that can switch to custom camera perspectives and fade the screen.
** Syntax: (Simplified)
*** {{cd|'''camera''' <players: target> . . .}}
**** {{cd|... '''''clear'''''}}
**** {{cd|... '''''fade''''' . . .}}

==== Technical ====
'''[[Add-on]]s and script engine'''
* Added experimental support for {{cd|BlockTraits}} in block JSON. {{cd|BlockTraits}} are a shortcut for creators to add vanilla [[block states]] and setter functions to data-driven blocks.
** Can parse {{cd|PlacementDirection}} ("{{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}}") {{cd|BlockTrait}} (adds the "{{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}}" {{cd|BlockState}} and {{cd|onPlayerPlace}} setter function).
** Can access the {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} state on blocks that apply the {{cd|placement_direction}} trait in {{cd|block_property}} molang queries and {{cd|set_block_property}} event responses.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[Add-on]]s'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:facing_direction}} state to the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} block trait.
**{{cd|minecraft:facing_direction}} is a six value integer state (down, up, south, west, north, east).
**Can enable and access this state on blocks through the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} trait.
**Can access the {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} state on blocks that apply the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} trait in {{cd|block_property}} Molang queries and {{cd|set_block_property}} {{cd|EventResponses}}.
*Pumpkin blocks use state {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} instead of {{cd|direction}}.
* Changed {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} and {{cd|minecraft:facing_direction}} states from int to string type.
** {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} has four values {{cd|["north", "south", "east", "west"]}}.
** {{cd|minecraft:facing_direction}} has six values {{cd|["down", "up", "north", "south", "east", "west"]}}.
* Removed {{cd|knockback_resistance}} item component.
*Added {{cd|PlacementPosition}} ({{cd|minecraft:placement_position}}) {{cd|BlockTrait}} block trait.
**Adds states {{cd|minecraft:block_face}} and/or {{cd|minecraft: vertical_half}}.
**{{cd|minecraft:block_face}} is a six value string state ({{cd|down}}, {{cd|up}}, {{cd|north}}, {{cd|south}}, {{cd|east}}, {{cd|west}}) that contains info on which block face the player clicked on when the block was placed.
**{{cd|minecraft:vertical_half}} is a 2 value string state ({{cd|bottom}}, {{cd|top}}) with info on whether the block was placed in the lower or upper half of the block position.
