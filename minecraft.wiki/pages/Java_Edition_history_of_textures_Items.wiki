{{about|all changes made to item textures|the texture atlas that housed all block textures prior to Java Edition 1.5 and Pocket Edition v0.8.0 alpha|items.png}}
This page attempts to document the full history of the textures of items, their additions, changes and removals. This page only documents items which have specific item textures (such as [[cauldron]]s and [[hopper]]s) - items which use 3D models of the block they represent, as well as items which are the 2D texture of the block in question, are not documented here but rather at [[Java Edition history of textures/Blocks]].

== List ==
{{info needed section|every texture from 1.21.2 onwards and some missing or incorrect textures and history. At some point, the clock and compass files went from an animated sprite sheet to seperate ones for each frame}}
=== Used item textures ===
<onlyinclude><!--- Make sure colored items are ordered: default, white, light gray, gray, black, brown, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, cyan, light blue, blue, purple, magenta, pink
Make sure wood items are ordered: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, mangrove, cherry, bamboo, crimson, warped
Make sure potions/tipped arrows are ordered: the same as Creative inventory
Make sure tools/armor are ordered: wood/leather, stone/chainmail, iron, gold, diamond, netherite 
Make sure fish items are ordered cod, salmon, tropical fish, pufferfish, axalotl, tadpole
After the above take precedence, remaining items should be ordered the same as Java 1.19.3+ Creative inventory when possible--->
