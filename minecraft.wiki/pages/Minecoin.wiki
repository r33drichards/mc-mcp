'''However, Minecoins cannot be converted into Tokens and vice versa.'''

=== Cross-buy currency ===
Since Bedrock and Legends uses the same currency and shared similar infrastructure (using the Bedrock Marketplace), they can be used both games, also known as cross-buy. This means you can get Minecoins from Bedrock Edition and spend it for Minecraft Legends (and vice versa) as long you use the same Microsoft account for both games. However, the contents from one game doesn't carry to the other.

== Usage ==
Minecoins are used to buy content from Marketplace. You can buy content such as [[world]]s, [[skin pack]]s, [[add-on]]s, [[Texture pack (downloadable content)|texture packs]], and [[mash-up pack]]s. 

They can also be used to buy apparel and cosmetic in the Character Creator, these include character parts from Body (Hair, Arms, & Legs) to Styles (Top, Bottom, Outerwear, Headwear, Gloves, Footwear, Face Item, & Back Item) as well as [[emotes]] inside the Character Creator.

Minecoins can be also use in Minecraft Legends. You can buy [[Legends:Skin|Skins & Textures]], [[Legends:Lost Legend|Lost Legend]], and [[Legends:Myth|Myths]].

=== After-purchase ===
If a player bought a content from Marketplace/Store, as long as they use the same Microsoft account, the purchase syncs across any device no matter what currency they use to purchase as long as it's a Bedrock platform with Marketplace support.

=== Non-transferrable ===
Minecoins and Tokens while the same, players cannot transfer one currency to another or use both currencies at the same time to buy the content.<ref>{{citation|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/27554163215885-What-are-Minecraft-Tokens|title=What are Minecraft Tokens?}}</ref>
