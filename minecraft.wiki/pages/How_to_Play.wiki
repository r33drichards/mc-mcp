[[File:Bedrock How to Play screen.png|thumb|The How to Play screen]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, '''How to Play''' is a built-in guide designed to help new players to ''[[Minecraft]]''. It tells the player how the main aspects of the game work, some controls, and some tips to get started. The guide is located in the Settings screen, accessible from the [[title screen]] or the [[pause menu]]. A list of topic links appear on the left, with content on the right. These sections are reproduced below.

At the bottom of the sections is a button leading to the [[Encyclopedia]]. The Encyclopedia describes more specific features in the game in detail. Some tabs in the Encyclopedia can be opened from "?" buttons in some GUIs, like the inventory and the [[cartography table]].

The Encyclopedia and the How to Play guide is sometimes missing information or outdated.

The content of this article reproduces the game's How to Play guide and Encyclopedia in its entirety, with some reformatting and internal linking as needed for optimal presentation as a Wiki page.

The How to Play guide and the Encyclopedia describe some [[controls]]. The controls differ on some devices, and the contents of the guide change with it. In this article, the default controls for Keyboard & Mouse are shown.

The table of contents includes all of the topics in the game's guide, starting with "Moving around".

=== Gathering resources ===
The world is full of resources, including building [[block]]s, crafting [[materials]], and [[food]].

You can break blocks with your bare hands to gather resources like [[dirt]] and [[Log|wood]]. Aim at a block, then click and hold [[File:Mouse_1.svg|width=28x28]] until it breaks and the resources drop.

Pick up any dropped resources by walking over the floating icons.

=== Selecting items ===
Resources you pick up will appear in your [[hotbar]], which you'll find at the bottom of the screen.

To hold an item in your hand, scroll the mouse wheel to select the item. You can also use a number key: 1 is the first hotbar slot and 9 is the last.

Some items, like [[bucket]]s, [[fishing rod]]s, and [[bow]]s can be used by tapping the build/use button [[File:Mouse_2.svg|width=29x29]].

==== 1. Hotbar ====
[[File:How to Play Hotbar BE.png|frameless]]

=== Placing blocks ===
Any blocks you've picked up can be placed back into the world. This way you can build a cozy shelter or anything else you can imagine!

Choose a block in your hotbar, then press [[File:Mouse_2.svg|width=29x29]] to place it.

Don't worry if you placed something in the wrong spot - simply break it again, then pick it back up!

=== Inventory ===
[[File:How to Play Inventory BE.png|frameless]]

==== 1. Inventory ====
Your hotbar will fill up as you gather more resources. Press E to access your [[inventory]], where you'll have more space for everything you've collected.

==== 2. Hotbar ====
Want to move something between your hotbar and your inventory? Open your inventory, click the item of your choice, then drag it to the empty item slot you'd like to move it to.

== Preparing for the first night ==

=== Your first craft ===
[[File:How to Play Recipe Book BE.png|frameless]]

==== 1. Crafting grid ====
Many blocks, like wood, can be turned into useful items by [[crafting]]. To do this, you'll find a simple crafting grid on the right-hand side of the inventory screen.

For example, put a single wood log anywhere on the crafting grid, and several [[planks]] will appear in the output slot.

Simply, drag your shiny new planks to your hotbar. Now you're ready to place them into the world!

==== 2. Crafting recipe ====
Some items require you to place your crafting ingredients in a certain shape - also called a [[recipe]].

Try placing two planks above each other to create some [[stick]]s. Useful for all sorts of things!

=== Recipe Book ===
Don't worry, you don't need to remember every crafting recipe by heart. The [[recipe book]] in your inventory keeps track of blocks and items you can craft - simply click a recipe to see what you need to craft it.

Once you've gathered the required crafting ingredients, click the recipe once more, then move it from the output slot to your hotbar or inventory.

=== The Crafting Table ===
[[File:How to Play Crafting Table BE.png|frameless]]

Ready to take your crafting to the next level? Place four planks in a square in your crafting grid, and you'll get a [[crafting table]] [[File:Crafting Table.png|frameless|width=24x24]] - a whole new way to craft.

Place your crafting table in the world, then right-click it to open it. The larger crafting grid will let you make bigger and better things, including [[tool]]s, [[bed]]s, and [[door]]s.

=== Crafting a Tool ===
Tools will help you get things done faster. Some, like the [[pickaxe]] [[File:Wooden Pickaxe JE3 BE3.png|frameless|width=24x24]], let you mine [[stone]] and various [[ore]]s. Others, like the [[sword]] [[File:Wooden Sword JE2 BE2.png|frameless|width=20x20]], help you keep enemies at bay.

To craft a tool, open up your crafting table [[File:Crafting Table.png|frameless|width=24x24]] by walking up to it and right-clicking it. You can craft a basic version of most tools using two sticks and a few planks - your recipe book will tell you how!

=== Mining ===
[[File:How to Play Mining BE.png|frameless]]

Not all crafting materials are on the surface - some may require you to dig underground or into a mountain.

A pickaxe [[File:Wooden Pickaxe JE3 BE3.png|frameless|width=24x24]] helps you uncover all sorts of materials, such as stone, [[coal]], [[iron]], and precious ore - though you may need extra sturdy tools for some rarer materials!

Some raw metals will need to be smelted using a [[furnace]] [[File:Furnace (S) BE2.png|frameless|width=24x24]]. Place a fuel like coal or wood logs in the fuel slot, then add raw ore to smelt it into something useful.

== Surviving the first Night ==

=== Nightfall ===
When the sun starts to set, it's time to get ready.

At night, the overworld is home to [[zombie]]s, [[spider]]s, [[skeleton]]s, and other dangerous creatures we call [[Hostile mobs|hostile monsters]].

Crafting some [[torch]]es can help you see in the dark, while also keeping mobs from spawning to close.

While holding a torch, place it into the world by right-clicking a nearby free surface.

=== Building a Shelter ===
[[File:How to Play Shelter BE.png|frameless]]

While danger comes lurking, a sturdy shelter can protect you from the threats outside.

Building a shelter is critical to surviving your first night, and it doesn't have to be hard.

You can build one with anything from dirt to stone, or even close up a [[cave]] for a makeshift lodging!

=== Death and Respawn ===
Enemies appear every night, and even the best of us can be caught off guard. If your [[health]] bar [[File:EnvSprite heart.png|frameless]] runs out, you'll [[die]] - and then respawn right where you started.

You have unlimited lives, but you drop all items in your inventory when you die. If you're quick enough, you can pick up your items back up right where you dropped them.

== Getting settled ==

=== Food ===
You'll slowly get hungry during your adventures - fortunately the Overworld is full of food! You can gather [[apple]]s from [[tree]]s, [[meat]] from [[animal]]s, or why not grow your own [[crops]] using a [[hoe]]?

To eat a food, select it in your hotbar, then click and hold the right mouse button. Keep the [[hunger]] bar [[File:Hunger.svg|frameless|width=16x16]] full to regain health when you take damage.

Some raw foods are better when cooked first on a [[campfire]] or in a furnace - your tummy will thank you!

=== Beds ===
A soft [[bed]] lets you sleep through the night. You'll need [[wool]] to craft one, as well as a safe spot to place it.

Sleeping in a bed will also set your [[spawn point]], meaning that if you die, you'll reappear right back home!

You can only fall asleep when it's cozy, like when it's nighttime or during a [[thunderstorm]].

=== Improved Tools ===
Use your tools a lot and they'll eventually break. As you gather new materials, such as stone, you'll be able to craft better tools.

Tools of higher tier are more durable, more efficient, and able to gather more valuable resources. Go out into the world and find out for yourself!

== Playing Together ==
''Minecraft'' is a [[multiplayer]] game by default.

=== Online multiplayer ===
Every new world you create starts with multiplayer enabled by default. If you want to make it private, go to World Settings to turn off multiplayer.

=== Joining an Online Game ===
To play with others, go to the Friends tab to see all available [[Realms]], Friends, and LAN games. Just select any game to join it.

When you start or join an online game, your friends can see this in their Friends tab. If they join, it'll be visible for their friends as well.

You need to be signed in to a Microsoft account with an active internet connection to play multiplayer.

=== Realms - The best way to play together ===
It's easy to play with friends using Realms.

You and up to 10 friends get 24/7 access to a world that's allways online. Explore, get creative, or try curated content from [[Marketplace]].

All you need is a paid Realms subscription. Why not try a free 30-day trial?

Try Realms

''This button takes the player to the Subscriptions tab in the [[Settings]].''

=== Player Permissions ===
You decide what people can do in your world by changing player [[permissions]].

Open the game menu to see a list of players currently in your world, then select the permissions icon to adjust that player's permissions.
