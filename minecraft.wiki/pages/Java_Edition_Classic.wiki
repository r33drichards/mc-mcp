'''Classic''' was the second phase in the [[Java Edition#Development|development cycle]] of ''[[Minecraft]]'' ({{JE}}), following [[pre-Classic]] and preceding [[Indev]], and was the first ''Minecraft'' development stage to have publicly released versions. At the time, this phase was named "'''alpha'''" by Notch during its development<ref>{{link|url=https://archive.org/download/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009/history/files/May-15-to-June-03-2009/2009-05-16.075419-0400EDT.txt.~1~|title=TigIRC logs|date=May 16, 2009, UTC–4|website=Archive.org|quote=(12:07:06) notch: minecraft alpha is available. I need someone on windows, someone on mac and someone on linux!}}</ref> (hence the "a" in the [[version number]]) until June 28, 2010, when a blog post retroactively labeled it as "'''Minecraft Classic'''".<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620024927/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/746938105/the-server-is-back-up|title=The server is back up!|website=[[The Word of Notch]]|date=June 28, 2010}}</ref> [[Creative#Classic Creative|Creative]] and later [[Survival]] game modes were introduced in this phase.

The release of Survival mode in Classic was conducted in a series of tests named [[Survival Test]]. It was a very early version of the game mode. The test had a point-based system, where the player could acquire points from killing some of the game's first [[mobs]]. Even after Classic was phased out, Survival Test was still playable until the website received a major overhaul on December 16, 2010, where it was quietly removed.

Classic does not support many of the main features in the current versions such as [[crafting]] or a proper [[inventory]]. [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091231-1856]] through [[Beta 1.7.3]] did not contain a "Creative" mode, so players continued to use Classic for building things that would take too long in newer versions. The addition of [[Creative]] mode in [[Beta 1.8]] rendered Classic functionally obsolete.

[[File:Classic server list archived.png|thumb|right|Classic [[server list]] captured from July 4, 2010. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100704100649/http://www.minecraft.net/servers.jsp archived])]]
The latest version of the Classic Creative game mode was playable for free on ''Minecraft.net''. After the release of [[Infdev]] it was no longer updated and only kept for historical purposes. According to [[Notch]], he planned on "slowly phasing it out", but "won't remove it, though. Just hide it."<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702141801/http://www.minecraft.net/|title=Minecraft}}</ref> It was playable in both singleplayer and multiplayer variations.

With the release of [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]] on September 14, 2011, Mojang removed the Classic resources directory and the addresses it was referring to for saving, possibly as a step towards phasing it out.{{cn}} As a result, sounds no longer worked and saving levels to the online server became impossible. Worlds that were not backed up locally were lost.

On August 8, 2012, the link on the website to Classic was removed, but re-added after many complaints.{{cn}} On July 1, 2013, because of the new launcher being able to play Classic, the link to Classic was removed again,{{cn}} though the page remained playable. The Classic game at that page went unsupported for some time, meanwhile, several major browsers increased their default Java security to the point where the game became essentially unplayable, until at some point between September 10<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910183326/https://minecraft.net/classic/play|title=Minecraft Classic Edition}}</ref> and 12<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912132237/https://minecraft.net/classic/play/|title=Not found}}</ref> 2015, the page containing Classic was itself removed entirely.

On May 7, 2019, a [[Minecraft Classic (JavaScript remake)|recreated JavaScript version]] of [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.23a_01]] was made available to play on the [[Minecraft website]] as part of the game’s tenth-anniversary celebrations.<ref>[https://classic.minecraft.net Minecraft Classic]</ref>

== Trivia ==
* The [[Version formats|version numbers]] used during [[Early Classic Creative]] and [[Multiplayer Test]] are in the same format as ''[[Wurm Online]]'', a game Notch developed from 2003 (<samp>0.0.''#''a with an optional ''_0#''</samp>).<ref>[[:File: Wurm Online 0.0.19a.jpg]]</ref>
* Prior to its removal from the website, player [[skin]]s used for the full game were synced with Classic. Thus, custom skins could be used in both singleplayer and multiplayer versions of Classic for premium users.
* In the Classic [[Minecraft.jar|jar files]], sprites for several mobs can be found. Playing a [[Survival Test]] map in normal Classic preserves mobs, and also lets the player have multiple blocks of the same type (or none at all) on the [[hotbar]].
* Classic uses very old [[liquid]] physics, making it possible to flood the whole map with water or lava from just one block of the liquid.
* Through the use of external tools, the [[Java Edition Classic 0.30 (Survival)|Survival version of 0.30]] can join servers running [[Java Edition Classic 0.30 (Creative)|the Creative version]]. Mobs appear in different locations on each client (as they are not server-based), and attempting to perform most Survival-specific actions (such as detonating TNT) results in the player being kicked.
* In Classic, the game world is not infinite. It is a cube made out of naturally generated blocks and surrounded by infinite water and [[bedrock]] (256 by 256 blocks).
* The ocean surrounding the map would end at a certain point (not visible in normal play). This end depends on the render distance.
* The <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> file for 0.30 (both Survival and Creative versions) has 4 random brick textures in the middle of the unused section, and it also contains an uncentered side gold block texture in the lower left hand corner.
