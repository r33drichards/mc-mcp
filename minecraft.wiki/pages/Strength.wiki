'''Strength''' is a [[effect|status effect]] which increases attack damage.

== Effect ==
{{IN|java}}, it increases melee damage by {{hp|3}} × ''level''.

{{IN|bedrock}}, melee damage under the Strength effect can be found through the equation <math>BaseDamage\times1.3^{level}+{1.3^{level}-1\over0.3}</math>, where <math>BaseDamage</math> is the ''default'' damage of whatever weapon or tool is used to attack.<ref>Background for this new equation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GtZ9ceTfVGbEkKkbZAfzpKKGk2FQ0FwmeUyw5ja14B8/edit?usp=sharing</ref> Example for an [[iron sword]]:
* Normal: {{hp|7}}
* Level 1: {{hp|10.1}}
* Level 2: {{hp|14.13}}

== Exceptions ==
Strength does not affect the damage of [[spear]] charge attacks,<ref>{{cite bug|MC|302778|Strength, Weakness and any other attack_damage attribute modifiers do not impact damage dealt by spears when performing charge attacks|resolution=Unresolved}}</ref> or the damage of [[ranged attack]]s.
