=== Items ===
{{Animate|Copper Nautilus Armor (item).png;Iron Nautilus Armor (item).png;Golden Nautilus Armor (item).png;Diamond Nautilus Armor (item).png;Netherite Nautilus Armor (item).png|32px|class=pixel-image}} '''[[Nautilus armor]]'''
* Equippable on [[nautilus]]es and [[zombie nautilus]]es.
* Has [[Copper Nautilus Armor|copper]], [[Iron Nautilus Armor|iron]], [[Golden Nautilus Armor|gold]], [[Diamond Nautilus Armor|diamond]], and [[Netherite Nautilus Armor|netherite]] variants.
** Copper, iron, golden, and diamond nautilus armor now have a chance to be found in the [[chest]]s for the following [[structure]]s:
*** [[Buried treasure]]
*** [[Ocean ruins]]
*** [[Shipwreck]]
** Copper, iron and golden nautilus armor can be [[Smelting|smelted]] into the respective [[nugget]]s.

{{Animate|Nautilus Spawn Egg.png;Zombie Nautilus Spawn Egg.png|32px}} '''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* Added nautilus and zombie nautilus spawn eggs.

{{Animate|Wooden Spear.png;Stone Spear.png;Copper Spear.png;Iron Spear.png;Golden Spear.png;Diamond Spear.png;Netherite Spear.png|32px}} '''[[Spear]]'''
* New weapon that can be crafted in [[Wooden Spear|wood]], [[Stone Spear|stone]], [[Copper Spear|copper]], [[Iron Spear|iron]], [[Golden Spear|gold]], [[Diamond Spear|diamond]] and [[Netherite Spear|netherite]] versions.
** Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use.
** Copper, iron and golden spears can be smelted into the respective [[nugget]]s.
** Wooden spears can be used as a fuel in a [[furnace]].
* Cannot be used to mine blocks, as opposed to other weapons.
* Can be enchanted with the exclusive enchantment [[Lunge]], in addition to the available enchantments for [[sword]]s (except [[Sweeping Edge]]).
* Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage.
** Has extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons.
* [[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s and [[piglin]]s can spawn holding a spear.
* Has two attacks: jab and charge.
** Jab
*** Used by quick-pressing the {{control|attack|text=primary action button}}.
*** Is a low-damage attack with knockback.
*** Has a cooldown between attacks.
*** Wooden spears have the fastest cooldown, while netherite has the slowest.
*** Can hit multiple enemies.
** Charge
*** Used by holding the {{control|use|text=secondary action button}}.
*** Damage is based on spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target.
*** While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
**** Engaged: The spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Tired: Indicated by the spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Disengaged: Indicated by the spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold.
*** The spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Nautilus.png|32px]] '''[[Nautilus]]'''
* A new neutral [[aquatic]] mob.
* Spawns in all [[ocean]] biomes.
* Has {{hp|15}} health.

* Occasionally attacks [[pufferfish]] within range using the dash attack.
* Takes suffocation damage on land.
* Grants the [[Breath of the Nautilus]] effect to mounted players.
* Can be [[bred]] and [[tamed]] using a [[pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]] or a [[bucket of pufferfish]].
* A tamed nautilus can be equipped with a [[saddle]], then the player can [[ride]] it.
** While riding it, the player can use its dash attack (similar to [[camel]]s) by pressing the {{control|jump}} button.
* Once tamed, has a roaming restriction around its home position of 16 blocks with a saddle, and 32 blocks without.
* Has a 5% ({{frac|1|20}}) chance of dropping a [[nautilus shell]] upon death, on a player kill, unaffected by [[Looting]].

[[File:Zombie Nautilus.png|32px]] '''[[Zombie nautilus]]''' 
* A new underwater mob that spawns with a Drowned rider wielding a [[trident]].
* Hostile only if ridden by a hostile mob.
* Behaves similar to the nautilus except that it cannot be bred.
* Burns in sunlight, like other [[undead]] mobs.
** Nautilus armor protects it from sunlight damage.
* Drops 0-3 [[rotten flesh]] when killed, on a player kill, unaffected by [[Looting]].

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|stopwatch}}'''
* New command that allows the creation of a stopwatch that keeps track of real time.
* Stopwatches do not depend on game ticks.
* They only run when the server/world is running, even when paused.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|stopwatch <id> create}} - creates a stopwatch with the given namespaced ID.
** {{cmd|stopwatch <id> query}} - shows the elapsed time in seconds of the given stopwatch in chat.
** {{cmd|stopwatch <id> restart}} - restarts the given stopwatch.
** {{cmd|stopwatch <id> remove}} - removes the given stopwatch.

=== Gameplay ===

'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* [[Lunge]]
** A new enchantment that is unique to the [[spear]].
** It is incompatible with [[Mending]].
** Only works with the jab attack.
** When doing a jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction.
** The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance.
** Does significant durability damage to the spear.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Component Predicates
** Component predicates (predicates field in block, item and entity predicates) now include predicates for checking existence of every component type.
** Those predicates are written as <code>{<component_type>: {}}</code>.
** Such predicate check passes as long as component is present, no matter the actual value.
** Existing predicates for specific components remain unchanged.
** Example:
*** <code>{predicates:{written_book_content:{author:"foo"}}</code> - existing format for matching books.
*** <code>{predicates:{written_book_content:{}}</code> - special case of above that accepted any value, as long as component existed.
*** <code>{predicates:{instrument:{}}</code> - checks if component <code>minecraft:instrument</code> exists (was not allowed before).

* Entity Predicates
** The {{cd|flags}} predicate now supports new values:
*** {{cd|is_in_water}}: when an entity is touching [[water]] or a [[bubble column]].
*** {{cd|is_fall_flying}}: when an entity is gliding with an [[elytra]].

* Item Predicates
** Item predicate in command form (<code><item>[predicate~{...},component={...}]</code>) has been extended to accept empty predicates for any component type.
** Similarly to component predicates in data, those empty entries only check for component existence.
** Existing shorter syntax for checking component existence remains unchanged.
*** That means {{cd|*[instrument]}} and {{cd|*[instrument~{}]}} are equivalent.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|70.0}}.
** This is due to Unifont being updated.

'''[[Server]]'''
* Added ClientFps JFR event.
* Experience packets that do not change the player's experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server.
* Client FPS is expected to be higher for most players.

'''[[Settings]]'''
* Graphics modes "Fast", "Fancy", and "Fabulous!" have been replaced with graphics presets with the same names.
* Settings on the Video Settings screen have been reordered and split into 3 sections: "Display", "Quality & Performance", and "Interface".
** The following settings that have been removed from the Video Settings screen, because were duplicating accessibility settings:
*** "View Bobbing"
*** "Glint Speed"
*** "Glint Strength"
*** "FOV Effects"
*** "Distortion Effects"
** Tweaks that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting have been split out to be configurable independently:
*** "See-Through Leaves"
*** "Show Vignette"
*** "Weather Effect Radius" 
**** Configures the distance in blocks within which rain and snow are visible.
*** "Improved Transparency" 
**** Resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind "Fabulous!".
** A new "Preset" slider was added to the top of the "Quality & Performance" section.
*** Presets control most of the "Quality & Performance" settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting.
*** Available presets are "Fast", "Fancy", "Fabulous!" and "Custom"
*** The default preset is "Fancy" for new players.
*** But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to "Custom" to preserve the current configuration.

'''[[Sounds]]'''
* [[Anvil]] destroy, land, place and use sounds now play at a slightly lower volume.

'''[[Tags]]'''
* Added {{cd|golden_spear}} to {{cd|#piglin_loved}} item tag.
* Added {{cd|#spears}} to {{cd|#enchantable/durability}} item tag.

* Renamed {{cd|#swords}} to {{cd|#enchantable/melee_weapon}} from {{cd|#enchantable/sharp_weapon}} item tag.
* Added {{cd|d=and|nautilus|zombie_nautilus}} to {{cd|d=and|#aquatic|#can_equip_saddle|#not_scary_for_pufferfish}} entity tags.

* <samp>[[celestials.png-atlas]]</samp>
** A new celestials atlas has been introduced, including sprites for objects rendered in the sky such as the Sun and Moon.
** Includes sprites from <samp><namespace>:textures/environment/celestial/<path>.png</samp>
** The following textures have been moved or split:
*** <samp>textures/environment/sun.png</samp> -> <samp>sun</samp>
*** <samp>textures/environment/end_flash.png</samp> -> <samp>end_flash</samp>
*** <samp>textures/environment/moon_phases</samp> -> <samp>moon/full_moon</samp>, <samp>moon/waning_gibbous</samp>, <samp>moon/third_quarter</samp>, <samp>moon/waning_crescent</samp>, <samp>moon/new_moon</samp>, <samp>moon/waxing_crescent</samp>, <samp>moon/first_quarter</samp>, <samp>moon/waxing_gibbous</samp>

'''[[Textures]]'''
* All blocks in the world now have mipmaps applied if enabled in video settings.
** Blocks that did not have mipmaps before, such as different vines, rails, foliage (apart from leaves) and more should look better from higher distances.
* {{cd|texture}} section of {{cd|*.mcmeta}} files has a new boolean field {{cd|darkened_cutout_mipmap}}
** The default value is {{cd|false}}
** It is set to {{cd|true}} for the block textures that had mipmaps before this version: 
*** All [[leaf]] types and [[mangrove roots]].
** If the field is set to {{cd|true}} and the texture is cutout the mipmaps will be darkened to emulate the darker interior of the block, this was the behavior for cutout mipmapped blocks before this version.
** Leaving the field unset or setting it to {{cd|false}} will generate mipmaps without darkening, and it fits well for other types of cutout blocks that do not have dark interior such as flowers, grasses, vines, rails, etc.
* Only mipmaps of level 0 and 1 are now animated for block animated textures.
* [[Glass]] and [[glass panes]] now support translucent textures.

'''[[UI]]'''

== Trivia ==
* This version has the same protocol version number as [[Java Edition 1.21.9 Release Candidate 1|1.21.9 Release Candidate 1]]. The two versions are not actually compatible; 25w41a crashes when attempting to join a 1.21.9-rc1 world, and 1.21.9-rc1 throws a "Network Protocol Error" message when attempting to join a 25w41a world.
* Unlike most first-of-the-week snapshots, 25w41a was released on a Thursday instead of a Tuesday, similar to the snapshots before [[Java Edition 14w26a|14w26a]].
