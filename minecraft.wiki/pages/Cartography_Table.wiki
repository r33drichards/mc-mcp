A '''cartography table''' is a utility [[block]] used for cloning, zooming out, and locking [[map]]s. It also serves as a [[cartographer]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A cartography table can be obtained using any [[tool]] or by hand, although using an [[axe]] is the fastest.
{{Breaking row|Cartography Table|Axe|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Cartography tables can generate naturally inside cartographer houses in [[village]]s. They can also generate in the [[trail ruins]] structure.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A1=Paper
|B1=Paper
|A2=Any Planks
|B2=Any Planks
|A3=Any Planks
|B3=Any Planks
|Output=Cartography Table
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Regardless of the player's [[position]] during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing the same direction (the texture with the globe in the right corner always faces west, while the one with the [[compass]] and map faces up).

=== Map functions ===

Cartography tables are used for zooming out, cloning, and locking maps (making them unable to be altered). {{IN|bedrock}}, they can also be used for adding pointers to maps, creating empty maps, and renaming maps.

Below is a list of brief descriptions of all available functions of the cartography table:

For more detailed information of each of these functions, see [[Map#Usage|Map § Usage]].

Zooming out a map always starts with an existing map, not a blank map. Zooming it out makes the map aligned to the grid that would include the area of the original map. To build a set of maps such as for a map wall, a player cannot create several level 0 (base) maps at one location then zoom them out before going out into the world to fill them in; the player must start with a base map created in each area to be covered by the zoomed out map. See more discussion of map alignment at [[Map]].

[[File:Cartography table map rename.png|thumb|176px|Renaming a map]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, the cartography table UI features a text field which can be used to rename a map or empty map. Unlike renaming items at an [[anvil]], this does not cost any [[experience]].

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a cartography table has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager may become a cartographer and claim it as their [[job site block]].

=== Fuel ===
A cartography table can be used as fuel in a [[furnace]], smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Note blocks ===
Cartography tables can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
