To celebrate ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s [[15th anniversary]], a ''Minecraft'' [[w:List of Google Easter eggs|Easter egg]] was added to Google search. After searching "''Minecraft''" in the search bar, a grass block rises from the bottom of the screen. If clicked, the mini-game begins.

== Opening the game ==
How to open the game:
* [https://google.com/search?q=minecraft Search "Minecraft" on Google]
* A grass block icon appears at the bottom of the screen. It might take a few seconds. Click the icon to start the game.
* When the game starts, the grass block icon is replaced with an "x" icon, and [[Steve]]'s fist appears on the bottom of the player's screen.
* The player must click on any of the search results so that they would be broken up like Minecraft blocks. Once a search result is broken up, a Minecraft-themed environment will appear in its place, and from there, players will be allowed to mine down Minecraft blocks.
* The "x" icon closes the game and returns to the search result page. When the game closes, a [[creeper]] appears, makes a hissing sound, and explodes. The search results page returns to normal, and the "x" icon is replaced with the grass block icon. The game can also be closed by simply closing the browser tab.

== Gameplay ==
=== Mining search results ===
On desktop, hovering over any mineable search result on the search page causes the mouse to become a [[crosshair]] symbol.

The player can click or tap any search result to mine it. All links and buttons on the page no longer function while playing the game.
While a search result is being mined, a [[mining]] animation plays - the player's hand or pickaxe punches or swings at the middle of the screen, and a cracking animation appears on the search result.

Each search result only needs to be clicked or tapped once to be mined, and does not need to be held (unlike mining in the real game). Multiple search results can be mined at once. Sponsored results cannot be mined.

A scene from ''Minecraft'', covered in mineable [[block]]s, is revealed after the player finishes mining each search result.

=== Breaking ===
The blocks in the front of the scene can be [[Breaking|broken]] simply by clicking or tapping them. Multiple blocks can be broken at a time by rapidly clicking or tapping them in succession, but tapping using multiple fingers at the same time on a touchscreen doesn't break any blocks.

==== Unmineable blocks ====
Some blocks are not mineable:
* {{BlockLink|Bedrock}}
* {{BlockLink|Carved Pumpkin}}
** {{BlockLink|Jack o'Lantern}}
* {{BlockLink|Chiseled Bookshelf}}
* {{BlockLink|Crafting Table}}
* {{BlockLink|Furnace}}
* {{BlockLink|Redstone Lamp}}

Each block (except bedrock and crafting tables) has a unique interaction when clicked or tapped:
* For a chiseled bookshelf, it toggles whether it has books in it or is empty.
* For a redstone lamp, it toggles whether the light is on or off.
* For a carved pumpkin, lights it, replacing it with a jack o' lantern, and vice versa.
* For a furnace, it toggles whether the furnace is lit or unlit.

==== TNT ====
Clicking or tapping TNT starts its fuse. The TNT explodes after 3 seconds, creating explosion particles and breaking all of the blocks in a 3×3 area around it.

=== Pickaxe upgrades ===
Breaking certain blocks causes the player's tool to upgrade.
* Breaking a cherry [[log]], oak log, oak [[plank]] or birch log with the player's fist puts a [[wooden pickaxe]] in the player's hand.
* Breaking [[stone]], [[deepslate]] block with the wooden pickaxe upgrades it to a [[stone pickaxe]].
* Breaking [[iron ore]] or deepslate iron ore with the stone pickaxe upgrades it to a [[iron pickaxe]].
* Breaking [[diamond ore]] or deepslate diamond ore with the iron pickaxe upgrades it to a [[diamond pickaxe]].
* Breaking a block of [[ancient debris]] with the diamond pickaxe upgrades it to a [[netherite pickaxe]], which is the final level.
When a tool is upgraded, a shower of [[experience orb]]s rains and the experience orb sound plays.

=== Score ===
The player gains 1 point for every block mined, regardless of block type. The player gains 7 points for each TNT exploded. After gaining more than 20 points, the score counter appears in the bottom left of the screen. If the game is closed then reopened without leaving or reloading the page, the score will not reset.

== Scenes ==
After a search result is mined, one of 18 different scenes can appear.

Clouds made of [[white wool]] generate in the sky to fill the upper areas of all [[Overworld]] scenes (except for the [[plains]] scenes).
