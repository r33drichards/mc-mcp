'''Vin''' is a [[vindicator]] appearing in [[Minecraft Mini-Series]] and member of Team Woodland.

== Appearance ==
He resembles a normal vindicator, stylized to fit with the rest of his series. The only apparent difference from a normal vindicator is a green bracelet on his right hand, representing his team.

== Personality ==
Vin is portrayed as an entirely silent character, lacking any dialogue or even mild grunts. As such, it is uncertain what his exact personality is.

== Biography ==
Alongside Eve, Vin was kidnapped by CommuniKate using a [[Command Block|command block]], and was forced to participate on her game show against his will. Upon being brought to [[Birch Island]], he and Eve were teleported incorrectly, warping in several feet into the air and falling into a pool. The first challenge given is to survive on Birch Island past nightfall with only the supplies found on the island; it is unclear how he and Eve survive.

The second challenge is to investigate a mineshaft, and look for [[gold]], whether that be [[Gold Ore|gold ore]] or lone [[Gold Ingot|gold ingots]]. During the adventure, [[Durango]] manages to locate a "motherload" above a pit of [[lava]], with each of the teams employing a different strategy for reaching it. For Team Woodland, they decide to use vexes to carry themselves over, however they both prove too heavy. Vin ends up plummeting straight into the lava, killing him. It is then revealed that contestants who die disqualify their entire team, banishing both members into a cage made out of [[obsidian]].

Later in the season, after many others had been exiled into the cage, Vin took part in an escape plan, using [[Diamond Pickaxe|diamond pickaxes]] created by [[Toby]] to break out with the others. After a lengthy battle, Vin would then help encase a [[Slowness|slowed]] CommuniKate in obsidian herself. The situation resolved, Toby would then try using a command block to return Eve and Vin back to their home in the [[Dark Forest|dark forest]], before any of the other teams. However, the command block was actually preprogrammed by CommuniKate to send the contestants over to the [[Greek Isles]], in hope of a second season.

Upon the second season actually starting, Eve, Vin, and the majority of the previous season's cast would be held captive by Poseidon. As part of his plan for world domination, he held them trapped on top of [[sand]] blocks, and incentivized the remaining participants to secure "[[Enchanted Ender Eye]]s" before a time limit in order to save them. In truth, he had no intention of letting any of them free, leaving Vin to be saved by the season 2 team, as well as Toby and [[River (Character)|River]].

== Relationships == 
=== Eve ===
Vin and Eve were likely comrades before the series began, as they were both teleported from the same [[Woodland Mansion]].
=== Quinn === 
While they were not on friendly terms, Vin helped Quinn sabotage the show and defeat Poseidon.

== Power and Abilities ==
Vin was initially teleported without items, like other participants of the show, but during the course of the plot of the first episode he acquires an [[iron axe]], but loses it in episode 2 after losing.

== Trivia ==
* Despite having a name shown at the beginning of multiple episodes, CommniKate refers to him only as Vindicator when banishing him.
* The name "Vin" is short for "[[Vindicator]]", which is who Vin is.
