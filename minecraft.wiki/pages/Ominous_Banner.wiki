An '''ominous banner''' is a special uncraftable variant of the [[banner]] obtained from [[raid captain]]s and [[pillager outpost]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Ominous banners can be broken with or without a [[tool]], but an [[axe]] is fastest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Ominous Banner|Axe}}

A ominous banner also breaks and drops itself as an [[Item (entity)|item]] if the block the banner is attached to is moved, removed, or destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Ominous banners are carried by [[raid captain]]s.<br> They are located in [[pillager outpost]]s.

{{IN|java}}, the ominous banner cannot be crafted or copied because the design uses 8 patterns.

{{IN|bedrock}}, the ominous banner is a separate type that cannot be placed in a loom.

Ominous banners have the following pattern:

White banner{{only|java|short=1}}
* Cyan Lozenge
* Light Gray Base
* Gray Pale
* Light Gray Bordure
* Black Fess
* Light Gray Per Fess
* Light Gray Roundel
* Black Bordure
Separate type entirely{{only|bedrock|short=1}}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Illager]]s that spawn carrying an ominous banner always drop it upon death.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Banner#Usage}}
Ominous banners are a special type of banner in the game as they have more than 6 patterns, and as such cannot be crafted. Ominous banners have the same placement functionality as regular banners.

=== Helmet ===
{{exclusive|java|section=13}}
While an ominous banner cannot be equipped in the [[Helmet|head slot]] in [[Survival]] mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how [[raid captain]]s wear banners{{only|java|short=1}}.

=== Chestplate ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=13}}
While an ominous banner cannot be equipped in the [[chestplate]] slot in Survival mode, equipping it using NBT editors causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how [[raid captain]]s wear banners{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}}.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Since ominous banners have more than six patterns, adding it to the shield causes the banner to be reduced to six patterns on the shield.

=== Copying ===
Unlike normal banners, ominous banners cannot be copied to make additional copies of the ominous banner.

=== Map marker ===
{{exclusive|java|section=13}}
Like regular banners, ominous banners can also serve as a map marker, having the same functionality as regular banners when used for marking points on a map.

=== Renaming ===
An ominous banner can be given a custom name that remains as the ominous banner is placed and retrieved. The player can use an [[anvil]] to rename the ominous banner item, or may change the <code>CustomName</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command on the ominous banner block.

=== Fuel ===
Ominous banners can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per banner.

=== Note blocks ===
Ominous banners can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

=== Looms ===
Unlike a regular [[banner]], ominous banners can't be used in a [[loom]] to apply patterns.<!-- Source? -->
