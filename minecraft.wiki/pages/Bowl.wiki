=== Crafting ===

|type= Material
}}

===Fishing===
{{Main|Fishing#Items obtainable}}
Bowls are obtainable through fishing, with a 1% chance per attempt. See [[fishing]] for more details. 

=== Eating ===
A bowl containing food (see below) becomes an empty bowl when the food is eaten.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Mooshrooms ===
{{control|use|text=Using}} a bowl on a red [[mooshroom|mooshroom or brown mooshroom]] turns the bowl into [[mushroom stew]] or [[suspicious stew]], respectively. The stew can then be consumed immediately and the process repeated, making this an excellent way to quickly restore depleted [[hunger]] and [[Food#Saturation|saturation]] with almost no cost or effort.

=== Fuel ===
Bowls can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.5 items per bowl {{in|je}}, and 1 item per bowl {{in|be}}.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* {{in|be}}, bowls are actually more fuel efficient than [[stick]]s. If 6 wood planks are crafted into 8 bowls, 8 items can be [[smelt]]ed; but if those are crafted into 12 sticks, only 6 items can be smelted. This can be useful when the player only has access to Nether wood types, which cannot be used as fuel.
