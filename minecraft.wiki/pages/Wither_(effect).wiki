'''Wither''' is a [[status effect]] that inflicts [[damage]] over time. It acts similarly to [[Poison]], save for the fact that it acts slower, can do so against the undead, and can kill on any difficulty level. It also turns the player's health to black, making their health harder to track.

It can be cured by drinking [[milk bucket|milk]].

== Effect ==
[[File:HUD recieved the Wither.gif|thumb|An animation of the [[health bar]] when it receives the Wither II effect for 5 seconds.]]
The amount of [[damage]] inflicted to the affected entity is shown in the table below:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
 ! Level !! Ticks per {{hp|1|notag=1}} !! {{hp|1|notag=1}} per second
 |-
 | 1 || 40 || {{hp|0.5}}
 |-
 | 2 || 20 || {{hp|1}}
 |-
 | 3 || 10 || {{hp|2}}
 |-
 | 4{{note|name=immunity|Due to [[damage immunity]], the effective rate is 10 ticks ({{hp|2|notag=1}} × 1 per second) at levels 4 and up.}}|| 5 || {{hp|4}}
 |-
 | 5{{note|name=immunity}} || 2 || {{hp|10}}
 |-
 | 6+{{note|name=immunity}} || 1 || {{hp|20}}
 |}
{{notelist|columns=1}}
The [[player]]'s hearts turn black ({{hp|2|withered=1|notag=1}} on [[Survival]] mode or {{hp|2|hardcore=1|notag=1|withered=1}} on [[Hardcore]] mode), making it more difficult, but still possible, for the player to see their [[health]]. Death is reported as "<player> withered away".
Amplifiers outside the range 0–31 (corresponding to levels 1–32) use {{w|Modulo operation|modulo}} 32.
