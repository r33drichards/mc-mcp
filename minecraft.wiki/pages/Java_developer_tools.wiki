'''Developer tools''' are tools used by [[Mojang Studios]] developers to develop new features and debug glitches.

== Accessible to players ==
A number of debug tools are available during normal gameplay:

* The [[debug screen]] is a screen that can be enabled using the {{key|F3}} key. It shows various values useful for debugging the state of the game.
* [[Debug hotkey]]s are key-combinations that trigger or enable debugging features.
* [[Debug renderer]]s are a set of graphical tools used for technical analysis of Minecraft.
* [[GameTest]]s are a system used to systematically test gameplay features.

== Accessible through debug properties ==
{{main|debug properties}}
Using special JVM properties (command line arguments when starting the game) many additional debug features can be enabled:
* Additional [[Commands#Debugging commands|debugging commands]]
* Additional [[Debug hotkey#Disabled hotkeys|debug hotkey]]
* Additional debug renderers
* Many other debugging tools (see [[debug properties]]) 

== Accessible only through mods ==
Some features, while part of the code, can only be enabled using [[mod]]s.

In most cases, mods can achieve this by overriding the <code>IS_RUNNING_IN_IDE</code> flag in the SharedConstants class.

=== Test Worlds ===
The "Create Test World" button on the title screen can be used to generate a superflat world that is designed to be used for testing.{{more info needed}} The world is set to allow commands and uses Creative as the default gamemode. It also disables the generation of structures, and changes some [[game rule]]s.

=== GameTest Exports ===
The GameTest feature contains a hidden functionality that allows users to export data to an SNBT file.{{more info needed}}

;Sub-commands
The following sub-commands are available on both singleplayer and multiplayer:

• /test export

• /test exportclosest

• /test exportthese

• /test exportthat

;Test Instance Blocks

If the functionality is enabled, the "Export Structure" option will appear in the GUI for the Test Instance Block.

;SNBT Files

Structure data that has been exported to an SNBT file is able to be loaded across different worlds. This can be done using a Structure Block or the "/place" command.

For example, to place a structure that has been exported to an SNBT file named "cookies", the following command can be used:

• /place template minecraft:minecraft/structure/cookies

In the video below, a YouTuber named EightSidedSquare showcased most of the developer tools before they were made available with debug properties.
