== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Anvil]]s'''
* Prior work cost increase changed from linear (1 per repair) to exponential (times 2 plus 1 per repair).
* Repairing with a "sacrifice" now costs 2 levels rather than only 1.

'''[[Button]]'''
* Can now be placed on ceiling/floors.

'''[[Dead bush]]es'''
* Now flammable.

'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* When a furnace runs out of fuel, the smelting progress reverses at twice the normal speed.

'''[[Item frame]]s'''
* Items in item frames can now be rotated by 45 degrees (eight possible orientations).
* Item frames can give off a signal detected by [[comparator]]s, based on the item's current orientation.
** Signal strength is as follows: 0: empty; 1: item; 2: item rotated once; 3: item rotated twice; ...; 8: item rotated 7 times.

'''[[Moss stone]]'''
* Now craftable in a shapeless recipe with one [[cobblestone]] and one [[vine]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Iron golem]]'''
* Can drop iron ingots again by any means of death.
* Can be spawned with pumpkins + dispenser.

'''[[Snow golem]] '''
* Can be spawned with pumpkins + dispenser.

'''[[Wither]]s'''
* Can be spawned with skulls + dispenser.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now harvest, collect and replant grown potatoes, wheat, and carrots.
** They do not have unlimited seeds; seeds must be replenished to replant crops.
* Craft wheat into bread, and drop it to other villagers.
* Can now become willing to breed by consuming food: 3 bread, 12 potatoes or 12 carrots.

'''[[Zombie pigman]]'''
* Can drop gold nuggets again by any means of death.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|fill}}'''
* Added the ability to filter block types, as long as the filler block is not a tile entity
** Only if it's used to fill in replace mode with "normal" blocks.
** Syntax: {{cmd|fill [x] [y] [z] [x] [y] [z] [BlockName] [Data] replace [filterBlockName] [filterData]}}.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* Looting now gives an extra 1% chance of getting rare loot per level.

'''[[Village mechanics]]'''
* Doors are now added to the closest village.
* This does not break iron farms, but change them a little, enough to make them "practically pointless".<ref>{{tweet|_grum|426299865673777152|well little enough to make them practically pointless.|January 23, 2014}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
[[File:Crosshairsindebug14w04a.png|thumb|3D crosshairs showing the XYZ axis in debug screen.]]
* The x coordinate line is now bold when looking east/west, similarly the z coordinate line is now bold when looking south/north.
* The crosshair displays 3 short colored lines to indicate the direction of each axis: x/red, y/green, z/blue.

'''Rendering & performance'''
* Only transparent blocks now render as transparent (eliminates the use of x-ray texture packs).

'''[[Skin]] customization'''
* Now displays the right arm's second layer in first person view.
* Skins and capes are now distributed through servers.
** Skins server outages will occur less frequently and have less impact.
** Server-altered skins/capes are not possible – only signed URLs are stored server-side.
** Skin changes will no longer require client restarting, at worst re-logging will update the skin for everybody.
** Duplicate skins no longer need to be downloaded twice.
** Server traffic will barely be affected.
