'''Water Breathing''' is a [[status effect]] that prevents or delays [[Damage#Drowning|drowning]], and allows [[waterlogging|waterlogged]] [[bed]]s{{only|bedrock}} to be used. {{IN|be}}, it additionally prevents or delays [[squid]], [[glow squid]], [[salmon]], [[cod]], [[pufferfish]], [[tropical fish]], and [[tadpole]]s from taking suffocation damage when they are not in water, and also prevents players/mobs from taking suffocation damage inside full, solid, non-transparent blocks.

{{EffectLink|Conduit Power}} also gives the player a similar effect to Water Breathing (among other things).

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Water Breathing.
*All [[mob]]s that can breathe underwater are unaffected by Water Breathing.{{only|java}}

== Notes ==
[[Helmet]]s with the [[Respiration]] enchantment slow down oxygen depletion, granting an extra 15 seconds of underwater breath per level. However, this is not done through the Water Breathing effect.
