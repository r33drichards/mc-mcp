==== Blocks ====
'''{{Animate|Crafter.png; Crafter Triggered.png; Crafter Crafting.png|32px}} [[Crafter]]'''
* A new [[block]] that enables the [[crafting]] of [[item]]s and [[block]]s via [[redstone]].
{{Crafting Table
|A1=Iron Ingot
|A2=Iron Ingot
|A3=Redstone Dust
|B1=Iron Ingot
|B2=Crafting Table
|B3=Dropper
|C1=Iron Ingot
|C2=Iron Ingot
|C3=Redstone Dust
|Output=Crafter
}}
* The crafter ejects one crafted item at a time when powered by a new redstone pulse. Upon receiving this new pulse, the crafter ejects the result from the front face.
* All the result items will be ejected together when the output result has multiple type of items.
* Crafters can be oriented in any direction when placed.
* They have a unique user interface:
** They have a 3×3 interactable crafting grid.
** Their crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand.
** A "toggled" slot cannot hold any items and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks such as [[hopper]]s and [[dropper]]s.
** Unlike the [[crafting table]], the slots display a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player.
** The user interface is shared between all players interacting with them, meaning that multiple players can interact with them at the same time, similar to [[chest]]s and hoppers.
* They interact with other blocks in the following ways:
** When read by a [[redstone comparator]], the redstone signal strength is 0 to 9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength.
** Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull items out of them.
** Droppers can be used to insert items into them.
** Moving items in from another block with a [[hopper]] or a [[dropper]] prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
*** Crafters prioritize the first empty slot from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
*** If there are no empty slots then crafters prioritize the smallest stack of the same item and pick the first if there are multiple.
*** If there is a toggled slot, it is skipped. The item will then be moved into the [[container]].
*** If the item cannot be moved, it is ejected into the [[world]].

'''[[File:Heavy Core JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Heavy Core]]'''
* A block which can be combined with a [[breeze rod]] to craft a [[mace]].
* The heavy core block has a 8.3% chance of being rewarded when using a [[ominous trial key]] on a [[ominous vault]] in the [[trial chambers]].

'''{{Animate|Ominous Trial Spawner (active) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Trial Spawner (ejecting) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Trial Spawner (inactive) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Ominous Trial Spawner]]'''
* A more powerful active phase of the trial spawner with unique challenges and rewards.
** Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards.
* If a trial spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner will become ominous if:
** It is not in cooldown.
** Or, it is in cooldown but was not ominous during its last activation.
*** Making it ominous this way will bypass the cooldown.
* While active, it will:
** Glow blue instead of orange.
** Emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
** Very commonly spawns mobs with equipment if they can wear it.
*** The equipment these mobs wear have armor trims applied from the trial chambers.
*** Known issue: these mobs can currently drop their equipment on death, but they will not in the future.
** Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs.
*** Based on their location, spawners in an area will select a random set of projectiles to spawn.
*** These projectiles will always include a single type of lingering potion from a set of possible effects.
* Becoming ominous will despawn any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge.
** It will stay ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished.
* When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot to normal trial spawners.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-trial-spawner-ominous}}
* Ominous trial keys have a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated ominous trial spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject trial keys.

'''{{Animate|Ominous Vault (inactive) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Vault (active) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Vault (unlocking) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Vault (ejecting) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Ominous Vault]]'''
* A variant of vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
* These can be found throughout the [[trial chambers]] in harder to find places and require an ominous trial key to unlock.
* These vaults hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard vaults unlocked by trial keys.
* Ominous vaults can provide some particularly valuable items.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-reward-ominous}}

'''{{Animate|Trial Spawner.png; Active Trial Spawner.png; Ejecting Trial Spawner.png|32px}} [[Trial Spawner]]'''
* Generates in [[trial chambers]].
* The trial spawner is a new form of [[spawner]] that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in [[multiplayer]].
* The challenge level will increase for each new player a trial spawner notices nearby.
** Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a trial spawner's cooldown.
* Unlike [[monster spawner]]s, a trial spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level.
** It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight.
** It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob.
** Spawned mobs are persistent.
* Once all mobs are defeated, the trial spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level.
** After the rewards have been ejected, the trial spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-trial-spawner}}
* Trial spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in [[Survival]] - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout [[trial chambers]].
* Trial spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with [[Silk Touch]].
* When placed in [[Creative]], trial spawners have no mob type set by default.
** The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a [[spawn egg]].
* Players in Creative or [[Spectator]] mode are not detected or noticed by trial spawners.

'''{{Animate|Vault.png; Vault (active).png; Vault (unlocking).png; Vault (ejecting).png|32px}} [[Vault]]'''
* Can be found in the [[trial chambers]].
* Can be unlocked with a [[trial key]].
* Each [[player]] can open the vault only once to get a reward.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[File:Bogged JE2 BE2.png|x32px]] [[Bogged]]'''
* A new variant of [[skeleton]]s that shoot poisonous arrows.
** They're faster to take down with {{hp|16}} health instead of {{hp|20}} health.
** They attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds.
* Has a chance to drop [[Tipped Arrow|Arrows of Poison]] when killed by [[player]]s.
* These mossy and mushroom covered skeletons spawn naturally in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s.
* The mushrooms on its head can be sheared to give 1-2 [[brown mushroom]]s and 1-2 [[red mushroom]]s.
** Can also be found spawning from [[trial spawner]]s in some [[trial chambers]].

'''[[File:Breeze JE1.webp|x32px]] [[Breeze]]'''
* The Breeze is a hostile [[mob]] that can spawn via [[trial spawner]]s in some rooms within the [[trial chambers]].
* The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances.
* An aggressive adversary, the breeze shoots [[wind charge]] projectiles at its target.
* Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an [[entity]].
* After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind charge, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks.
* Drops 1-2 [[breeze rod]]s when killed by a player.
** The number of breeze rods dropped is affected by [[Looting]] enchantment.
* Wind charges also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
** Non-iron [[door]]s and [[trapdoor]]s are flipped.
** [[Fence gate]]s are flipped.
** [[Button]]s are pressed.
** [[Lever]]s are flipped.
** [[Bell]]s are rung and swung.
** Lit [[candle]]s (both standalone and on [[cake]]) are extinguished.
* Wind bursts do not have any effect on iron doors, iron trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a redstone signal.

==== Non-mob entities ====
'''[[File:Wind Charge JE2 BE2.webp|x32px]] [[Wind Charge]]'''
* Fired by the [[breeze]] and players who use the wind charge item.
* Explodes upon impact, emitting a large burst of gust [[particles]] and [[knockback|knocking]] entities back similar to a TNT explosion.
* Its explosion interacts with certain blocks, including [[button]]s and [[trapdoor]]s.
* Deals damage when colliding directly with a player or mob.
* Can be deflected, just like [[fireball]]s.

==== World generation ====
'''[[File:Isometric Chamber-6.png|x32px]] [[Trial Chambers]]'''
* Trial chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game.
** Trial chambers are made out of a variety of [[copper]] and [[tuff]] blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small.
** Trial chambers are fairly common under [[deepslate]] layers underground.
* The layout of each trial chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, rewards, and a variety of combat spaces.
** Supply chests can be found between the different rooms, and give the player blocks and items which help them navigate their trials.
** [[Decorated pot]]s generate around the trial chambers, and can be smashed open to find a little loot inside.
** [[Vault]]s and [[ominous vault]]s are guarded by combat challenges in most rooms, and require a [[trial key]] or [[ominous trial key]] to be opened. They can be a source of many high level enchanted books, consumables, and equipment.
** Some rooms include hidden areas that can contain chests, beds for players to set their respawn point, and vaults. Some also contain passageways that players can [[crawl]] through and lead to other rooms.
* Each trial chamber will include trial spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:

* Each trial spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each trial chamber.
** For example, one trial chamber might only spawn [[zombie]]s, [[cave spider]]s and [[stray]]s, while another might only spawn [[slime]]s, [[silverfish]] and [[skeleton]]s.
** The exceptions to this are some trial spawners in unique rooms which always spawn [[breeze]]s.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Achievements]]'''
{{Load achievements|Revaulting;Crafters Crafting Crafters;Who Needs Rockets?;Over-Overkill}}

'''[[Ominous Event]]s'''
* Optional challenge obtained (triggered) by having Bad Omen.
** They are designed to challenge the player and "shake up" the experience in new ways.
* [[Bad Omen]] no longer triggers a [[raid]] directly.
* A [[raid]] is now labelled as an ominous event.
* Bad Omen transforms into [[Raid Omen]] when a [[player]] enters a [[village]].
* Bad Omen also transforms into [[Trial Omen]] when a player is seen by a [[trial spawner]].
* [[Ominous trial]]s:
** This mechanic can be described as a more challenging version of the battle that happens when an active trial spawners spawns mobs for the player to fight.
** Triggered by Trial Omen.
** Effectively lasts as long as the player has Trial Omen or as long as there are [[ominous trial spawner]]s nearby.
** The ominous trial spawners control the ominous trial, just like how normal trial spawners control a normal trial.
** During the trial, random projects are spawned and dropped near any active ominous trial spawner.
** The mobs spawned by ominous trial spawners usually wear armor if they can.
*** The armor is usually enchanted.
*** Every piece of the armor always has the [[bolt armor trim]], with [[copper ingot|copper]] as the [[trim material]].

'''New [[Enchantments]]'''
* Three new enchantments have been introduced that are unique to the [[mace]].
** [[Breach]]
*** Rare enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
*** Has 4 levels.
*** Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target.
**** The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level.
** [[Density]]
*** Common enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
*** Has 5 levels.
*** Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level.
**** Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 1 per level of Density.
** [[Wind Burst]]
*** Unique enchantment which can only be found in [[ominous vault]]s.
*** Has 3 levels.
*** Maces enchanted with Wind Burst will emit a burst of wind upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other.
*** Each level will bounce the attacker higher up in the air.

'''New [[Effect]]s'''
* [[File:Infested.png|32px]] [[Infested]]
** Affected entities have a 10% chance to spawn 1&ndash;2 [[silverfish]] when hurt.
** Silverfish cannot get this effect.
* [[File:Oozing.png|32px]] [[Oozing]]
*** Affected entities will spawn two [[slime]]s upon death.
*** Slimes cannot get this effect.
* [[File:Raid Omen JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Raid Omen]]
** A variant of Bad Omen.
** Obtained by entering a [[village]].
** Triggers a [[raid]] 30 seconds after being obtained.
** Once the Raid Omen expires, a raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen.
* [[File:Trial Omen.png|32px]] [[Trial Omen]]
** A variant of Bad Omen.
** Obtained by being seen by a [[trial spawner]].
** Triggers an [[ominous trial]] when obtained.

** Affected entities will emit a wind burst upon death.

'''New [[Game rule]]s'''
