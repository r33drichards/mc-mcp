== Trailer ==
{{Main|Piston}}
An official video documenting some of Beta 1.7's major features was released on Mojang's official [[YouTube]] channel on June 30th, 2011. The video was made by Hat Films. Made before ''[[Java Edition]]'' was officially released (and long before [[Java Edition 1.7|1.7]] came out), the trailer omits “Beta” when referring to the version number.
