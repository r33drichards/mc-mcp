'''Invalid data value planks''' are item forms of the [[planks]] block with damage values outside of the usual range which planks can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value planks are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Transmutation (''Java Edition''/Legacy Console Edition) ===
[[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation|Several methods of block transmutation]] can be used to obtain invalid data value planks in block form. These blocks can be mined from 1.2.4{{verify}} to 14w21b{{verify}} to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.

== Usage ==

=== Placement ===
{{empty section}}

=== Conversion to future versions ===

== History ==

|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w43a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE3.png|32px}} The missing texture has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value planks also changing.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=17w47a|Numeric IDs for blocks and items have been completely removed from the game, with different species of planks being given their own string IDs. As a result, invalid data value planks have been "removed" as any such item now converts cleanly into oak planks.}}
