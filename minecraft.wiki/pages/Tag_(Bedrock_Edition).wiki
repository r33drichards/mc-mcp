{{About|the registry tags in ''Bedrock Edition''|other uses|Tag}}

'''Tags''' (also called '''registry tags''') in [[behavior pack]]s allow players to group different game elements together. 

== Usage ==
Tags are defined in the block's, item's, and biome's behavior definitions as follows:

=== JSON format ===
<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} The root object.
**{{nbt|compound|minecraft:{{ph|definition}}}}: The type of definition. Must be a {{cd|block}}, {{cd|item}}, or {{cd|biome}}.
***{{nbt|compound|components}}
****{{nbt|compound|minecraft:tags}} (Biomes and items only)
*****{{nbt|list|tags}}: List of tags.
******{{nbt|string}}: A tag name.
****{{nbt|compound|tag:{{ph|tag name}}}}: (Blocks only) {{cd|{{ph|tag name}}}} is replaced by the name of the tag. Object must be empty.
</div>
A block, item, or biome may have multiple tags. Custom and vanilla tags are authorized.

Tags can be used to run queries in commands and behavior packs.

== List of tag types ==
This section lists the tag types that are used by the game to affect its behavior in various ways, as well as those that are populated by default, even if the game does not use them to control some behavior.
