{{relevant tutorial|Defeating a woodland mansion}}
<!-- Note: Please do not change "illager" to "villager"; illager is actually correct and is the name given to hostile villagers (illusioners, evokers, vindicators, pillagers, and ravager).-->

A '''woodland mansion''' is a massive systematically-generated [[structure]] found in [[dark forest]]s and [[pale garden]]s. It is often found far away from the [[world spawn point]]. A mansion is inhabited by [[vindicator]]s, [[evoker]]s, and [[allay]]s and is one of the only places where a [[totem of undying]] can be obtained. Besides [[illager]]s, a mansion's interior lighting is sufficiently low for other Overworld monsters to spawn.

== Generation ==
Woodland mansions typically generate thousands of [[block]]s from the spawn point, but they can spawn at any distance. They can be located with [[woodland explorer map]]s, which are obtained from cartographer [[villager]]s, but a map may not always point to the nearest one. The nearest woodland mansion may also be located via the {{cmd|locate structure mansion}} [[command]]s enabled by cheats.

A woodland mansion naturally generates [[vindicator]]s, [[evoker]]s, and [[allay]]s inside the mansion, but because the entrance is open and most rooms in the woodland mansion are dark, [[Overworld]] [[mob]]s sometimes spawn in these rooms or come in through the entrance at night. 

The first floor of the mansion may only generate rooms that contain vindicators; from the second floor upward, some large rooms may contain both evokers and vindicators. Rarely, a vindicator can spawn in the corridors and hallways.

Allays are found imprisoned in cells inside “jail” rooms, often guarded by a vindicator. 

Once all the vindicators and evokers are killed in a woodland mansion, they do not respawn, unlike [[pillager]]s, who respawn constantly in and around [[pillager outpost]]s.

== Structure ==
{{main|/Structure}}

Although their exact structure varies, all woodland mansions have some things in common: they all have three floors with a variety of rooms, and generate a [[cobblestone]] foundation underneath the entire structure if there are any gaps between the bottom of the mansion and the ground. The top floor is about half the size of the lower floors, but its size is random for each mansion, depending on how many rooms are generated on the top floor. Each mansion includes a large foyer that leads to the corridors connecting the rooms. A giant staircase, which leads up to the second floor, generates in the large foyer. The foyer is dark and hostile mobs can spawn under the staircase.  

=== Rooms ===
A woodland mansion contains many types of rooms. Because the layout is randomly generated, some room types may not be present. Furthermore, certain rooms within the mansion are not readily accessible – some may have sealed entrances, while secret rooms have no entrances at all.

One may access the individual structures of a woodland mansion by using [[structure block]]s to manually load room structures from the <code>/data/minecraft/structures/woodland_mansion</code> folder in [[minecraft.jar]]. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter <code>woodland_mansion/''structure_name''</code>, and press LOAD. A list of possible rooms, the names of these structures, and small descriptions are provided in the table below. Note that the room names are conjectural.

==== Main and secret rooms ====
A woodland mansion can sometimes generate secret rooms on each floor. A secret room can be one of the following type: "X" room, spider room, fake end portal room, obsidian room, birch pillar room, clean chest room, lava room, and attic room, with the "X" room being the most common, and the "lava" room being the rarest. One method to look for secret rooms is to look for gaps between normal rooms, this way is best on the first floor, as there are no windows. Another way is looking through the windows on the second and third floors of the mansion, since some secret rooms are exposed to windows. A final method to look for a secret room is cutting down the roof, which works best for the third floor alone. Then the player can see any secret rooms from the roof of the floor, as well as the whole floor's layout. 

In the table below, a {{BlockLink|Structure Block|structure block}} indicates either a [[chest]] with random loot, or the spawn point of an [[illager]].

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Woodland mansions were added as a way to implement illagers, the main antagonists of the then-developing game ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', into the base game of ''Minecraft'', providing them with a place to live.<ref>{{ytl|YRPlscod34Y|t=186|WOODLAND MANSION MYSTERY: Episode 3|Minecraft|January 6, 2023}}</ref>
* Prior to the 1.14 ''[[Village & Pillage]]'' update, woodland mansions were the only way of getting totems of undying, due to the raid system not being implemented yet.
