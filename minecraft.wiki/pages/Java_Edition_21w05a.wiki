'''21w05a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on February 3, 2021, which adds lush cave related features and fixes bugs.<ref>{{snap|21w05a|February 3, 2021}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Azalea JE2 BE2.png; Flowering Azalea JE2 BE2.png|32px}} [[Azalea]]'''
* Bush-like block which can be planted on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s.
* Has variants with either no blossoms or pink blossoms.
* Azalea can grow from moss blocks when [[bone meal]] is used on them.

'''{{Animate|Azalea Leaves.png; Flowering Azalea Leaves.png|32px}} [[Azalea leaves]]'''
* Has variants with either no blossoms or pink blossoms.
* Yield azalea and sticks on decay.

'''{{Animate|Cave Vines (head) JE1 BE1.png; Cave Vines (berries) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Cave vines]]'''
* A natural light source, with a light level of 10 or 14 (depending on whether it's head or body).
* Drop [[glow berries]].
** Growth can be sped up using [[bone meal]].
** Berries can be harvested by {{ctrl|interacting}} with the vine.
* Grow from glow berries when placed on the underside of a block.
* Unlike regular [[vines]], they cannot be climbed.

'''{{Animate|Small Dripleaf JE3.png; Big Dripleaf JE2 BE1.png|32px}} [[Dripleaf]] '''
* Allows an entity to stay on it for 1.5 seconds (30 ticks), before the entity falls through it.
** The tilt happens in 3 stages: "Unstable", "Partial", and "Full". These can be seen in the F3 debug menu.
*** All the stages are solid except the "Full" stage, which is when the player falls through.
*** When nobody is standing on it, it is set to "None" stage.
*** If the player sneaks on it while it's in the "Unstable" stage, it returns to "None". Sneaking on it while it's in "Partial" or "Full" stage has no effect.
* Comes in two sizes: small and big. Small dripleaf can be applied [[bone meal]] to grow into the big variant.
** Small dripleaf can only be obtained with [[shears]] (otherwise breaks), and can only be planted on [[clay]], or underwater on clay and dirt blocks.
** Big dripleaf can be obtained with any tool or by hand, as well as breaking it using projectiles, and can be planted on grass and dirt blocks.

'''[[File:Hanging Roots JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Hanging roots]]'''
* Decorative blocks that can only be placed on the underside of a block.
* Obtained with [[shears]], otherwise break.

'''[[File:Moss Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Moss block]]'''

* Breaks when pushed by a piston.

'''[[File:Moss Carpet.png|32px]] [[Moss carpet]]'''
* Same texture as the moss block, but one pixel thick.
* Crafted with moss blocks.

'''[[File:Rooted Dirt JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Rooted dirt]]'''
* A dirt-like block with roots on its texture.
* Similar to [[coarse dirt]], neither mycelium nor grass spread to it.

'''[[File:Spore Blossom JE1 (facing NWU).png|32px]] [[Spore blossom]]'''
* Can only be placed on the underside of a block.
* Sends particles downward when opened.

{| class="wikitable"
!Vibration types
!Frequency value
|-
|Minecart Moving, Ring Bell, Block Change
|6
|-
|Drinking Finish, Prime Fuse
|7
|-
|Mob Interact
|8
|-
|Equip, Shear, Ravager Roar
|9

|}
* "Block change" is for when a player or dispenser changes a block.
** This includes placing a book on a lectern, placing and removing items from a flower pot, putting out a campfire, placing a candle on a cake, tilting a big dripleaf, and putting out a candle.<!--Not eating a slice of cake, it's a different event-->
* "Mob interact" is for certain mob interactions to cause vibrations.
** This includes giving a golden apple to zombie villager with Weakness, healing a tamed wolf, using an iron ingot to heal an iron golem, and most instances of successfully feeding an animal.
* "Prime fuse" applies to both creepers and TNT.
* The "equip" event checks for giving items to an armor stand and pressing the {{ctrl|use}} button to equip armor from the hotbar.
** Manually equipping armor does not trigger sculk sensors.
** Removing armor, from the player or from an armor stand, does not trigger sculk sensors.
** Equipping items on other mobs, such as horses, does not trigger sculk sensors.

'''[[Stonecutter]]'''
* Can be used to craft the different [[copper block]] variants.

=== Items ===
'''[[Bundle]]'''
* The player now receives a tutorial when first having a bundle in the inventory.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Glow berries are now required for "A Balanced Diet" advancement.

'''NBT data'''
* All projectile entity data now has a field called <code>HasBeenShot</code>.
** If this field is false, during the next tick the projectile fires a projectile shot game event, causing any nearby sculk sensors to react.

=== General ===
'''[[Game event]]s'''
* Removed the "armor stand add item", "eating finish", "entity hit", and "flint and steel use" events.
* Added the "block change", "drinking finish", "eat", "entity damaged", "entity killed", "entity place", "equip", "mob interact", "minecart moving", "prime fuse", "ravager roar", "ring bell", "shear", "shulker close", and "shulker open" events.

'''[[Custom|Customized world]]'''
* World height/depth is shrunk to a max range of Y=-2032 to Y=2031 now (compares with the previous version: Y=-2048 to Y=2031), due to the limitation of light processing codes.<ref>{{bug|MC-212347}}</ref>
