'''LittleBigPlanet Mash-up''' (also known as '''Minecraft: LittleBigPlanet Edition''') is a [[mash-up pack]] based on the ''{{W|LittleBigPlanet}}'' game series developed by {{W|Media Molecule}}. It was released exclusively on {{editions|ps3|ps4|psvita}}, as well as {{BE}} on PlayStation consoles. It contains a skin pack, a texture pack and a world template.

== World template ==

==== Spawn ====
The [[player]] spawns inside the pod located underground with 6 [[trapdoor]]s. The world features levels from the LittleBigPlanet franchise which can be traveled to via [[minecart]]. These levels include "Skate to Victory", "Boom Town", "Sensei's Lost Castle", "The Frozen Tundra" from {{w|LittleBigPlanet (2008 video game)|LittleBigPlanet}}, "Patients Are a Virtue" from {{w|LittleBigPlanet 2}}, & "Stitchem Manor" from {{w|LittleBigPlanet 3}}. The surface features a giant globe which can only be reached outside as it is a one-way entrance to the pod.

The [[Overworld]] landscape is based on the planet Earth.

==== Skate to Victory ====
Located at the top left, where the United States & Canada are. (X -219, Y 63, Z -165 at the start point) It appears mostly the same as its counterpart from the game. However, with the removal of one tutorial cinema, no ghosts appear inside the Castle, and one Boot at the entrance of the castle. There is a [[village]] surrounding the landscape that features arrows leading back to spawn.

==== Boom Town ====
Located at the bottom right where Australia is. (X 239, Y 70 Z 193 at the start point) It appears mostly the same as its counterpart from the game.

==== Sensei's Lost Castle ====
Located at the middle right where China is. (X 329 Y 64 Z -123 at the start point) It appears mostly the same as its counterpart from the game.

==== The Frozen Tundra ====
Located at the top right. (X 119, Y 70, Z -285 at the start point) It appears mostly the same as its counterpart from the game.

==== Patients Are a Virtue ====
Located at the bottom left where South America is. (X -235 Y 102 Z 261 at the start point) It appears mostly the same as its counterpart from the game.

==== Stitchem Manor ====
Located at the bottom where South Africa is, near spawn. (X 20, Y 69, Z 225 at the start point) It appears mostly the same as its counterpart from the game. However, with a lack of any bounce pads & layer launch, being replaced with...{{info needed}}

It features the [[Nether portal]] at the top of the Manor. (X 21, Y 120, Z 121)

==== Stronghold ====
[[End portal]] (X 142, Y 37, Z 116)
