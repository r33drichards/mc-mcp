'''Minecraft -- Pocket Edition Available on Xperia PLAY''' is a trailer made to promote the initial release of ''[[Pocket Edition]]'', originally exclusive to the {{Wikipedia|Xperia Play}}.

== Summary ==
The video consists of two [[builder]]s slowly constructing a replica of a Xperia Play, made up of various blocks that existed at the time, such as [[glass]], [[black wool]], and [[obsidian]]. They start at the bottom of the device, and work their way up layer by layer, slowly manifesting identifiable details such as circuits, button holes, and then the screen. Seconds before the construction would have completed, an image of the real device fades in, with the game on the screen and a caption telling people to play it.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Beta 1.2 02 (20110517).png|thumb|right|Builders attempting to build an incomplete Xperia Play in a leaked dev version of ''Java Edition'']]
* As opposed to simply two [[player]]s or animated models of [[Steve]], the builders featured in the video were an actual mob programmed into a version of ''[[Java Edition]]''. This feature was never supposed to be released to the public, but would eventually leak in a [[Java Edition Beta 1.2 02 (20110517)|build]] with an incomplete version of the Xperia Play build.
