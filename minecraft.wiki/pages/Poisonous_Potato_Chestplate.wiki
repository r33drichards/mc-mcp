|ignoreusage=1
}}

== Usage ==
The poisonous potato chestplate can be equipped in the second armor slot like any other chestplate. It doesn't provide protection from damage, but instead replenishes the player's [[hunger]] bar.

If the player loses a hunger point while the poisonous potato chestplate is equipped, it gets added back immediately, and the chestplate loses 40 points of [[durability]]. Because it has 240 points in total, it can replenish {{Hunger|6}} hunger points. Note that the chestplate fills up the hunger bar only to the level that player had when the chestplate was equipped.

The poisonous potato chestplate doesn't inflict player with Poison, despite being made from poisonous potatoes.

=== Peeling ===
If the player has the chestplate equipped, another player can peel it {{control|using}} the [[potato peeler]] on them. The chestplate disappears, and a number of [[potato peels]] are scattered around the player that was wearing it.
