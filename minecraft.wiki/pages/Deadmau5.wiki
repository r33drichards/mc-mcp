== In the ''Minecraft'' franchise ==
{{Main|Easter eggs}}
At an unknown time, [[Markus Persson]] took notice of Zimmerman's interest in ''Minecraft'', gifting him a unique skin featuring his signature "mau5 ears." Later, he would attend ''[[MINECON 2011]]'', hosting a segment called "Into the [[Nether]]." At one point, he and Notch beheaded a model [[chicken]] with a [[golden sword]].<ref>{{YouTube link|RUR92lSY2ys|Deadmau5 and Notch beheading a minecraft chicken|miranbresic|November 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|deadmau5|139014177250488320|3=die minecraft chicken!!! DIE!!! http://youtube.com/watch?v=RUR92lSY2ys  inb4 PETA.}}</ref>

Deadmau5 received a mention in the [[Loading tips/Legacy Console Edition|loading tips of Legacy Console Edition]] stating that he likes Minecraft.

=== Ears ===
With the addition of [[cape]]s, Notch also added ears for deadmau5. The ears are additional geometry attached to the player's head, with the texture contained within deadmau5's skin file. deadmau5 cannot disable his ears; erasing the ear texture from the skin file would still render them with a solid black color. Deadmau5's name tag is also programmed to render ten pixels higher to be above the ears. The ears are set to show up based on the username, rather than the UUID of the player, meaning that if deadmau5 were to change his name, he would not keep his ears.

As a side effect of this Easter egg, in versions before [[Java Edition 1.21.9 Pre-Release 2]] any entity with the name tag "deadmau5", including named mobs, had its name tag render ten pixels higher than a normal name tag.

== Trivia ==

* The name of the song "[[Living Mice]]" is a direct reference to Deadmau5 made by [[Daniel Rosenfeld|C418]] as he helped him make the first [[Minecraft - Volume Alpha|''Minecraft'' soundtrack album]].<ref>https://c418.org/albums/minecraft-volume-alpha/</ref>
* At one point, Deadmau5 gave away free gift codes to play ''Minecraft'' on social media.<ref>{{Tweet|deadmau5|23529901936087042|unused minecraft gift codes! first come first served! enjoy folks!<br>v7l2-b7c5-a5x8<br>b3g6-v7p4-j8e3<br>l9j8-s6n7-j7a8... http://fb.me/RTulqxyF}}</ref>
