'''25w34a''' (incorrectly titled '''Snapshot 25w34a''' in-game) is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.9]], released on August 19, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w34a|id=a|August 19, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|fetchprofile}}'''
* New command that fetches the contents of a player profile from ''Minecraft'' servers.
* Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously.
** Results will be printed only when operation finishes, but the game will keep running unpaused.
* After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets users copy the contents of a fully resolved {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component or {{cmd|give @s minecraft:player_head}} with said component.
* Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns {{cd|1}}.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|fetchprofile name <player name>}}: resolves profile by username (case-insensitive).
** {{cmd|fetchprofile id <uuid>}}: resolves profile by UUID.

=== General ===
[[File:MC25w34a-CodeOfConductScreen.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Minecraft: Java Edition 25w34a. There is a dialog with the caption "Server Code of Conduct". The conduct here is an example, in this case saying "Hello, Minecraft Wiki!". The user is given a choice to either acknowledge and join the server, or disconnect. There is also a check box for the user to not be notified about the code of conduct on subsequent server connections.|The Code of Conduct screen shown when connecting to a server with it enabled.]]
'''Server Code of Conduct'''
* When connecting to a server, a Code of Conduct screen can now be shown.
** Accepting the Code of Conduct is required to play on the server.
** A checkbox is available for not showing the same Code of Conduct in the future.
*** If the Code of Conduct changes, it will be shown again.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Copper golem]]'''
* The eyes of the copper golem are now invisible as well when splashed with [[potion of Invisibility]].
* The hitbox has been tweaked.
** The hitbox is now 0.6 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through open doors.
** The hitbox is now 1.01 blocks in height to not get stuck in certain blocks.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Sounds]]'''
* The sound effect produced by an End flash now has a higher delay.
* [[Copper golem]]s & [[copper chest]]s are now audible from up to 12 blocks away.
* The copper sorting sounds have been tweaked to be quieter.

=== General ===
'''[[Block entity data]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:skull}}
** The {{cd|profile}} field has been changed to match {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component.
*** That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary.

'''[[Block states]]'''
* Removed <code>align_items_to_bottom</code> block state property from [[shelf]] block.
** It has been replaced with an equally named boolean field on the [[shelf]] block entity.
** Shelves created with this property set in the last snapshot will reset back to the default value (<code>false</code>)

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* <code>minecraft:profile</code>
** Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically.
** Previously contents of this component would permanently change when profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft service.
** To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged.
** This component has now two behaviors:
*** Static: when it has <code>properties</code> field or when both <code>name</code> and <code>id</code> are present or when both are missing.
**** In this state, profile will always render as-is.
**** If <code>properties</code> field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on <code>id</code>, same as in offline mode).
**** That means skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation.
**** This option is preferred for decorational uses.
*** Dynamic: when it has either <code>name</code> or <code>id</code> (but not both).
**** When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value.
**** This means that this item will always render with current skin of targeted player.
***** If a player changes skin while game is running, change will not be visible unless clients restart.
**** Resolution might happen with a delay, during which item will render with a default skin.
**** Profile name will replace item name only when it's present.
***** Items with just <code>id</code> will show default name.
**** Items will dynamic profiles be distinguished from static ones with label in tooltip.
** Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won't stack together.
** Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in never versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|84.0}}.

'''[[Options]]'''
* The "Hide Lightning Flashes" accessibility setting has been renamed to "Hide Sky Flashes" and now also disables the [[End Flash]]es.
** When the flash is disabled by the setting the world will not be lit by the flash, but the flash source will still be visible in the sky and the sound effect will still play.

'''[[Panorama]]'''
* Updated the panorama to show a scene with copper golems in a village.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|66.0}}.

'''[[Server.properties]]'''
* A new boolean field has been added to {{samp|server.properties}} called <code>enable-code-of-conduct</code>.
** Setting it to <code>true</code> will make the server look for code of conduct files in the {{samp|codeofconduct}} subfolder in the same folder as {{samp|server.properties}}
** Each file in the folder should have the form {{samp|<language_code>.txt}}
*** The language shown will attempt to match the player's language.
*** If it doesn't exist, the {{samp|en_us}} code of conduct will be used.
*** If that also doesn't exist, an arbitrary available entry is used.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* The Statistics screen now uses the same type of tabs as the [[Create New World]] screen instead of buttons.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added {{cd|barrier}} to {{cd|#impermeable}} block tag.
* Removed {{cd|guardian}} from {{cd|#cannot_be_pushed_onto_boats}} entity type tag.

'''[[Text component format]]'''
* Bold and italics styles are ignored when drawing sprites.
