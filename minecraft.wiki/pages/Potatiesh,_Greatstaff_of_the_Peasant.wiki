'''Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant''' or just '''potato staff''' is an item dropped from [[mega spud]]s used to create [[potato portal]]s in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
[[Mega spud]] drops one potato staff if killed by a player or a tamed wolf.

== Usage ==
Players that have either completed the Non Plus Ultra [[advancement]] or are in [[Creative]] can {{control|use}} potato staffs on a block to create [[potato portal]]s. If a player in [[Survival]] that has not completed the Non Plus Ultra advancement attempts to create a potato portal, an explosion of power 5 occurs at the player's position, and the following message is displayed in chat:

* '''''<player> was unworthy of Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant'''''
Potato staffs can create portals in any dimension and on any side of a block.

Additionally, {{control|using}} the staff on a [[composter]] always fills it up by one layer, and grants the Good Plant advancement.

== Trivia ==
*The item name is likely a reference to Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian, a weapon in World of Warcraft.
*The item texture is a [[blaze rod]] with a compressed [[poisonous potato]] layered on top of it, causing it to look out of place because of the bluriness.
