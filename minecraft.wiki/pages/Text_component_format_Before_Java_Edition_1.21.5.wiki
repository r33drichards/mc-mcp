{{about|the text component format before [[Java Edition 1.21.5]]|the current format|Text component format}}
{{outdated|Text component was previously JSON-based, but now [[SNBT]]-based on [[Java Edition 1.21.5]].|edition=java}}

Before [[Java Edition 1.21.5]], the text component format was very different. The biggest difference is that text components were represented exclusively in [[JSON]] and saved as strings containing [[JSON]], rather than being represented as [[SNBT]] and saved as [[NBT]] objects.

For example, instead of <code>{text: "Hello World", color: "red"}</code>, you would write <code>{"text": "Hello World", "color": "red"}</code> or <code>'{"text":"Hello World","color":"red"}'</code> depending on the context.

The biggest reason why this was the case is that NBT did not support heterogenous lists whereas JSON did, but in 1.21.5 this was changed so text components no longer needed to be saved as JSON.<ref>https://minecraft.wiki/w/NBT_format#History</ref>

== Format ==
The format is made up of text components. There is a single root component, which can have child components, which can have their own children and so on. Components can also have formatting and interactivity added to them, which is inherited by their children.

A component can be a {{nbt|string}} string, {{nbt|list}} array or a {{nbt|compound}} object. Strings and arrays are both shorthand for longer object structures, as described below.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|string}} A string containing plain text to display directly. This is the same as an object that only has a {{nbt|string|text}} tag. For example, <code>"A"</code> and <code>{"text": "A"}</code> are equivalent.
* {{nbt|list}} A list of components. Same as having all components after the first one appended to the first's {{nbt|list|extra}} array. For example, <code>["A", "B", "C"]</code> is equivalent to <code>{"text": "A", "extra": ["B", "C"]}</code>. Note that because the later components are actually children of the first one, any formatting applied to the first component is inherited by the later ones. For example, <code>[{"text": "A", "color": "red"}, "B", "C"]</code> will display all three letters with red text.
* {{nbt|compound}} A text component object. All non-content tags are optional.
**'''''Content'''''
*** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Specifies the content type. One of {{code|[[#Plain Text|"text"]]}}, {{code|[[#Translated Text|"translatable"]]}}, {{code|[[#Scoreboard Value|"score"]]}}, {{code|[[#Entity Names|"selector"]]}}, {{code|[[#Keybind|"keybind"]]}}, or {{code|[[#NBT Values|"nbt"]]}}.
*** If {{nbt|string|type}} is not present, has an invalid value, or if the required tags for the specified type are not present, the type is determined automatically by checking the object for the following tags: [[#Plain Text|{{nbt|string|text}}]], [[#Translated Text|{{nbt|string|translate}}]], [[#Scoreboard Value|{{nbt|compound|score}}]], [[#Entity Names|{{nbt|string|selector}}]], [[#Keybind|{{nbt|string|keybind}}]], and finally [[#NBT Values|{{nbt|string|nbt}}]]. If multiple are present, whichever one comes first in that list is used.
*** Values specific to each content type are described [[#Content types|below]].
** '''''Children'''''
*** {{nbt|list|extra}}: A list of additional components to be displayed after this one.
**** A child text component. Child text components inherit all formatting and interactivity from the parent component, unless they explicitly override them.
** '''''Formatting'''''
*** {{nbt|string|color}}: Optional. Changes the color to render the content in the text component object and its child objects. If not present, the parent color will be used instead. The color is specified as a color code or as a color name.
****<code>"#<i><hex></i>"</code>, where <code><i><hex></i></code> is a [[wikipedia:Web_colors#Hex_triplet|6-digit hexadecimal color]], changes the color to #<i><hex></i>
****<code>"black"</code> changes the color to {{color|#000000}}
****<code>"dark_blue"</code> changes the color to {{color|#0000AA}}
****<code>"dark_green"</code> changes the color to {{color|#00AA00}}
****<code>"dark_aqua"</code> changes the color to {{color|#00AAAA}}
****<code>"dark_red"</code> changes the color to {{color|#AA0000}}
****<code>"dark_purple"</code> changes the color to {{color|#AA00AA}}
****<code>"gold"</code> changes the color to {{color|#FFAA00}}
****<code>"gray"</code> changes the color to {{color|#AAAAAA}}
****<code>"dark_gray"</code> changes the color to {{color|#555555}}
****<code>"blue"</code> changes the color to {{color|#5555FF}}
****<code>"green"</code> changes the color to {{color|#55FF55}}
****<code>"aqua"</code> changes the color to {{color|#55FFFF}}
****<code>"red"</code> changes the color to {{color|#FF5555}}
****<code>"light_purple"</code> changes the color to {{color|#FF55FF}}
****<code>"yellow"</code> changes the color to {{color|#FFFF55}}
****<code>"white"</code> changes the color to {{color|#FFFFFF}}
*** {{nbt|string|font}}: Optional. The resource location of the [[Resource pack#Fonts|font]] for this component in the resource pack within <code>assets/<namespace>/font</code>. Defaults to <code>"minecraft:default"</code>.
*** {{nbt|boolean|bold}}: Optional. Whether to render the content in bold.
*** {{nbt|boolean|italic}}: Optional. Whether to render the content in italics. Note that text that is italicized by default, such as custom item names, can be unitalicized by setting this to <code>false</code>.
*** {{nbt|boolean|underlined}}: Optional. Whether to underline the content.
*** {{nbt|boolean|strikethrough}}: Optional. Whether to strikethrough the content.
*** {{nbt|boolean|obfuscated}}: Optional. Whether to render the content obfuscated.
*** {{nbt|int|}}{{nbt|list|shadow_color}}: Optional. Sets the color of the text shadow. The decimal value is calculated with (alpha << 24) + (red << 16) + (green << 8 ) + blue, where each component is between 0 and 255. In list format it expects 4 float values between 0 and 1 for alpha, red, green, blue.
** '''''Interactivity'''''
*** {{nbt|string|insertion}}: Optional. When the text is shift-clicked by a player, this string is inserted in their chat input. It does not overwrite any existing text the player was writing. This only works in chat messages.
*** {{nbt|compound|clickEvent}}: Optional. Allows for events to occur when the player clicks on text. Only work in chat messages and [[written book]]s, unless specified otherwise.
****{{nbt|string|action}}: The action to perform when clicked. Valid values are:
***** <code>"open_url"</code>: Opens {{nbt|string|value}} as a URL in the user's default web browser.
***** <code>"open_file"</code>: Opens the file at {{nbt|string|value}} on the user's computer. This is used in messages automatically generated by the game (e.g., on taking a screenshot) and cannot be used by players for security reasons.
***** <code>"run_command"</code>: Works in signs, but ''only'' on the root text component, not on any children. Activated by {{control|using}} the sign. In chat and written books, this has {{nbt|string|value}} entered in chat as though the player typed it themselves and pressed enter. However, this can only be used to run commands that do not send chat messages directly (like {{cmd|say}}, {{cmd|tell}}, and{{cmd|teammsg}}). Since they are being run from chat, commands must be prefixed with the usual "/" slash, and player must have the required permissions. In [[sign]]s, the command is run by the server at the sign's location, with the player who {{control|used}} the sign as the command executor (that is, the entity selected by <code>@s</code>). Since they are run by the server, sign commands have the same permission level as a [[command block]] instead of using the player's permission level, are not restricted by chat length limits, and do not need to be prefixed with a "/" slash.
***** <code>"suggest_command"</code>: Opens chat and fills in {{nbt|string|value}}. If a chat message was already being composed, it is overwritten. This does not work in books.<ref>{{bug|MC-70317|||Works as Intended}}</ref>
***** <code>"change_page"</code>: Can only be used in written books. Changes to page {{nbt|string|value}} if that page exists.
***** <code>"copy_to_clipboard"</code>: Copies {{nbt|string|value}} to the clipboard.
**** {{nbt|string|value}}: The URL, file path, chat, command or book page used by the specified action.
*** {{nbt|compound|hoverEvent}}: Optional. Allows for a tooltip to be displayed when the player hovers their mouse over text.
**** {{nbt|string|action}}: The type of tooltip to show. Valid values are:
***** <code>"show_text"</code>: Shows a text component.
***** <code>"show_item"</code>: Shows the tooltip of an item as if it was being hovering over it in an inventory.
***** <code>"show_entity"</code>: Shows an entity's name, type, and UUID. Used by {{nbt|string|selector}}.
**** {{nbt|compound|contents}}: The formatting of this tag varies depending on the action.
***** For <code>"show_text"</code>: Another text component. Can be any valid text component type: string, array, or object. Note that {{nbt|compound|clickEvent}} and {{nbt|compound|hoverEvent}} do not function within the tooltip.
***** For <code>"show_item"</code>: The item stack whose tooltip that should be displayed.
****** {{nbt|string|id}}: The item's [[resource location]]. Defaults to {{code|minecraft:air}} if invalid.
****** {{nbt|int|count}}: Optional. Size of the item stack. This typically does not change the content tooltip.
****** {{nbt|compound|components}}: Optional. Additional information about the item. See [[Data component format|item components]].
***** For <code>"show_entity"</code>: The entity whose tooltip should be displayed.
****** {{nbt|compound|name}}: Optional. Hidden if not present. A text that is displayed as the name of the entity.
****** {{nbt|string|type}}: A string containing the type of the entity, as a [[resource location]]. Defaults to {{code|minecraft:pig}} if invalid.
****** {{nbt|string|}}{{nbt|list|id}}: The [[UUID]] of the entity. Either:
******* A string representing the UUID in the hyphenated hexadecimal format. Must be a valid UUID.
******* A list of four numbers representing the UUID in int-array format. As this is JSON and not SNBT there is no dedicated integer array type, so the int-array format looks like {{code|[1,1,1,1]}} rather than {{code|[I;1,1,1,1]}}. Fractional numbers and numbers outside the 32-bit integer range will be truncated. Booleans are also permitted, with {{code|true}} and {{code|false}} converting to 1 and 0 respectively.
**** {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|list}}{{nbt|compound|value}}: Deprecated, use {{nbt|compound|contents}} instead. The formatting and type of this tag varies depending on the action.
***** For <code>"show_text"</code>: Another text component. Can be any valid text component type: string, array, or object. Note that {{nbt|compound|clickEvent}} and {{nbt|compound|hoverEvent}} do not function within the tooltip.
***** For <code>"show_item"</code>: A string containing the SNBT for an item stack. See {{slink|Player.dat format|Item structure}}.
***** For <code>"show_entity"</code>: A string containing SNBT. The SNBT does not represent the full entity data, but only stores the name, type, and UUID of the entity.
****** {{nbt|string|name}}: Optional. Hidden if not present. An NBT string containing some JSON that is parsed as a text component and displayed as the name of the entity.
****** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. An NBT string containing the type of the entity, as a [[resource location]]. Defaults to {{code|minecraft:pig}} if invalid or missing.
****** {{nbt|string|id}}: An NBT string containing the UUID of the entity in the hyphenated hexadecimal format. Must be a valid UUID.
</div>

Due to the {{nbt|list|extra}} tag, the above format may be recursively nested to produce complex and functional text strings. However, a text component doesn't have to be complicated at all: virtually all properties are optional and may be left out.

=== Content types ===
Text components can display several types of content. These tags should be included directly into the text component object.

====Plain Text====
Displays plain text.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The text component.
** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Set to {{code|"text"}}.
** {{nbt|string|text}}: A string containing plain text to display directly.
</div>

====Translated Text====
Displays a translated piece of text from the currently selected [[language]]. This uses the client's selected language, so if players with their games set to different languages are logged into the same server, each will see the component in their own language.

Translations are defined in [[Resource pack#Language|language files]] in [[resource pack]]s, including the built-in resource pack.

Translations can contain slots for text that is not known ahead of time, such as player names. When displaying the translated text, slots will be filled from a provided list of text components. The slots are defined in the language file, and generally take the form <code>%s</code> (displays the next component in the list), or <code>%3$s</code> (displays the third component in the list; replace <code>3</code> with whichever index is desired).<ref group=note>Selecting the "next" argument ignores slots that specify an index explicitly. So if the translation text "Hello %s, %2$s, and %s." was given the components "John" and "Becky", it would display "Hello John, Becky, and Becky."</ref> For example, the built-in English language file contains the translation <code>"chat.type.advancement.task": "%s has made the advancement %s",</code>.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The text component.
** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Set to {{code|"translatable"}}.
** {{nbt|string|translate}}: A translation identifier, corresponding to the identifiers found in loaded language files. Displayed as the corresponding text in the player's selected language. If no corresponding translation can be found, the identifier itself is used as the translated text.
** {{nbt|string|fallback}}: Optional. If no corresponding translation can be found, this is used as the translated text. Ignored if {{nbt|string|translate}} is not present.
** {{nbt|list|with}}: Optional. A list of text components to be inserted into slots in the translation text. Ignored if {{nbt|string|translate}} is not present.
*** A text component. If no component is provided for a slot, the slot is displayed as no text.
</div>

====Scoreboard Value====
Displays a score from the [[scoreboard]].

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style="text-align:left;margin:0px;max-width:800px;"
|- 
!Requires [[#Component resolution|component resolution]].
|- 
|This component is resolved into a {{nbt|string|text}} component containing the scoreboard value.
|-
|}

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The text component.
** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Set to {{code|"score"}}.
** {{nbt|compound|score}}: Displays a score holder's current score in an objective. Displays nothing if the given score holder or the given objective do not exist, or if the score holder is not tracked in the objective. 
*** {{nbt|string|name}}: The name of the score holder whose score should be displayed. This can be a [[selector]] like @p or an explicit name. If the text is a selector, the selector must be guaranteed to never select more than one entity, possibly by adding <code>limit=1</code>. If the text is <code>"*"</code>, it shows the reader's own score (for example, <code>/tellraw @a {"score":{"name":"*","objective":"obj"}}</code> shows every online player their own score in the "obj" objective).<ref group="note">Showing the reader's own score only works in situations where a message has one singular reader. That is chat messages, [[Commands/title|<code>/title</code>s]], and [[Written book|written books]]. It does not work for [[bossbar]] display names or blocks like signs.</ref>
*** {{nbt|string|objective}}: The internal name of the objective to display the player's score in.
</div>

====Entity Names====
Displays the name of one or more entities found by a [[selector]].

If exactly one entity is found, the entity's name is displayed by itself. If more are found, their names are displayed in the form "Name1, Name2, Name3", with gray commas. If none are found, the component is displayed as no text.

Hovering over a name shows a tooltip with the name, type, and [[UUID]] of the target. Clicking a player's name suggests a command to whisper to that player. Shift-clicking a player's name inserts that name into chat. Shift-clicking a non-player entity's name inserts its UUID into chat.

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style="text-align:left;margin:0px;max-width:800px;"
|- 
!Requires [[#Component resolution|component resolution]].
|- 
|
* If the selector finds a single entity,
** If the entity is a player, the component is resolved into a {{nbt|string|text}} component containing their name.
** If it is an entity with a [[Name Tag|custom name]], it is resolved into the text component of the custom name. In all vanilla survival scenarios ([[name tag]], [[anvil]]) this will be a {{nbt|string|text}} component.
** If it is a non-player entity with no custom name, it is resolved into a {{nbt|string|translate}} component containing the translation key for the entity type's name.
: The resolved component also has an {{nbt|string|insertion}} tag, a {{nbt|compound|hoverEvent}} tag with the <code>show_entity</code> action, and a {{nbt|compound|clickEvent}} tag with the <code>suggest_command</code> action (if the entity is a player) added to it to provide the functionality described above. If any of these tags are already present on the original component being resolved, the tag on the original component will be used.
* If more than one entity is found by the selector, the component is resolved into an empty {{nbt|string|text}} component, with an {{nbt|list|extra}} list containing the individual entity name components (each resolved as in the single entity case) separated by copies of the {{nbt|any|separator}} component (or its default, if not present).
* If no entities are found by the selector, the component is resolved into an empty {{nbt|string|text}} component.
|-
|}

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The text component.
** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Set to {{code|"selector"}}.
** {{nbt|string|selector}}: A string containing a [[selector]].
** {{nbt|compound|separator}}: Optional, defaults to <code>{"color": "gray", "text": ", "}</code>. A text component. Used as the separator between different names, if the component selects multiple entities.
</div>

====Keybind====
Displays the name of the button that is currently bound to a certain [[Controls#Configurable controls|configurable control]]. This uses the client's own control scheme, so if players with different control schemes are logged into the same server, each will see their own keybind.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The text component.
** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Set to {{code|"keybind"}}.
** {{nbt|string|keybind}}: A [[Controls#Configurable controls|keybind identifier]], to be displayed as the name of the button that is currently bound to that action. For example, <code>{"keybind": "key.inventory"}</code> displays "e" if the player is using the default control scheme.
</div>

====NBT Values====
Displays [[NBT format|NBT]] values from [[Entity|entities]], [[Block entity|block entities]], or [[Commands/data#Storage|command storage]].

NBT strings display their contents. Other NBT values are displayed as SNBT, with no spacing between symbols. If {{nbt|boolean|interpret}} is set to true, the game will instead attempt to parse and display that text as its own text component. That usually only works on strings, since JSON and SNBT are not compatible. If {{nbt|boolean|interpret}} is true and parsing fails, the component is displayed as no text. If more than one NBT value is found, either by selecting multiple entities or by using a multi-value path, they are displayed in the form "Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4".

{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed" style="text-align:left;margin:0px;max-width:800px;"
|- 
!Requires [[#Component resolution|component resolution]].
|- 
|
* If {{nbt|boolean|interpret}} is false, the component is resolved into a {{nbt|string|text}} component containing the display text.
** If multiple values are selected and {{nbt|any|separator}} is not present, the entire component is still resolved into a single {{nbt|string|text}} component, with the text ", " between the display text of each value.
** If multiple values are selected and {{nbt|any|separator}} is present, each value is resolved into an individual {{nbt|string|text}} component, and all values after the first will be added to the first's {{nbt|list|extra}} list, separated by copies of the {{nbt|any|separator}} component.
* If {{nbt|boolean|interpret}} is true, the component is resolved into the parsed text component. For any non-content tags that are present on both the parsed text component and the component being resolved, the tag on the component being resolved will be used.
** If multiple values are selected, all values after the first will be added to the first's {{nbt|list|extra}} list, separated by copies of the {{nbt|any|separator}} component (or its default, if not present). This means that all values after the first will inherit the first value's formatting tags, if any.
|-
|}

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The text component.
** {{nbt|string|type}}: Optional. Set to {{code|"nbt"}}.
** {{nbt|string|source}}: Optional. Allowed values are {{code|"block"}}, {{code|"entity"}}, and {{code|"storage"}}, corresponding to the source of the NBT data.
** {{nbt|string|nbt}}: The [[NBT path format|NBT path]] used for looking up NBT values from an entity, block entity, or storage. Requires one of {{nbt|string|block}}, {{nbt|string|entity}}, or {{nbt|string|storage}}. Having more than one is allowed, but only one is used.<ref group=note>If {{nbt|string|source}} is left unspecified, NBT sources are checked in the order {{nbt|string|entity}}, {{nbt|string|block}}, {{nbt|string|storage}}. If multiple are present, whichever one comes first in that list is used.</ref>
** {{nbt|boolean|interpret}}: Optional, defaults to false. If true, the game attempts to parse the text of each NBT value as a text component. Ignored if {{nbt|string|nbt}} is not present.
** {{nbt|compound|separator}}: Optional, defaults to <code>", "</code>. A text component. Used as the separator between different tags, if the component selects multiple tags.
** {{nbt|string|block}}: A string specifying the coordinates of the block entity from which the NBT value is obtained. The coordinates can be absolute, [[Commands#Tilde and caret notation|relative]], or local. Ignored if {{nbt|string|nbt}} is not present.
** {{nbt|string|entity}}: A string specifying the [[Selector|target selector]] for the entity or entities from which the NBT value is obtained. Ignored if {{nbt|string|nbt}} is not present.
** {{nbt|string|storage}}: A string specifying the [[resource location]] of the [[command storage]] from which the NBT value is obtained. Ignored if {{nbt|string|nbt}} is not present.
</div>

=== Component resolution ===
Certain text content types ({{nbt|compound|score}}, {{nbt|string|selector}}, and {{nbt|string|nbt}}) do not work in all contexts. These content types need to be ''resolved'', which involves retrieving the appropriate data from the world, rendering it into "simple" text components, and replacing the "advanced" text component with that. This resolution can be done by [[signs]], by [[written book]]s when they are first opened, by [[boss bar]] names, by [[text display]]s, and by commands such as [[Commands/tellraw|<code>/tellraw</code>]] and [[Commands/title|<code>/title</code>]]. It can also be done by the [[Item modifier|item modifers]] '''set_name''' and '''set_lore''', but only if their {{nbt|string|entity}} tag is set. Custom item names, custom entity names and [[scoreboard]] objective names cannot by themselves resolve these components.

Additionally, resolution fixes a single value in place. Therefore, these content types are not dynamic, and don't update to reflect changes in their environment, while "simple" components usually do.
