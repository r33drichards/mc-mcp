A '''fire charge''' is an [[item]] that can be {{control|used}} as a single-use version of a [[flint and steel]] or shot as a [[small fireball]] from a [[dispenser]].

== Obtaining ==
Despite firing small fireballs, blazes do not drop fire charges.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|fire-charge}}

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|Blaze Powder
|Coal; Charcoal
|Gunpowder
|Output= Fire Charge, 3
|type= Miscellaneous
}}

=== Bartering ===
When given a [[gold ingot]], [[piglin]]s have a ~8.53% ({{frac|40|469}}) chance to [[barter]] a single fire charge.

=== Natural occurrence ===
{{main|Ominous Trial Spawner#Projectile spawning}}
During [[ominous trial]]s, each [[ominous trial spawner]] has a {{frac|1|5}} chance to dispense a fire charge on top of either a player or a mob it spawns. The fire charge is directly dispensed into the world and cannot be obtained in the inventory.

== Usage ==
[[File:Natural Fire Charge.png|200px|thumb|Dispensed small fireball]]

Fire charges can be used as ammunition in [[dispenser]]s or as a single-use substitute for a [[flint and steel]].

When used, it instantly places a [[fire]], similar to flint and steel. But, unlike flint and steel, the fire charge is consumed in the process. It can prime [[TNT]] and light [[nether portal]]s, [[campfire]]s, [[candle]]s, [[Cake|cakes with candles]], and [[creeper]]s{{only|JE}}.

When a fire charge is fired from a dispenser, it shoots a [[small fireball]]. However, a player ''cannot'' simply {{ctrl|use}} a fire charge while holding it to shoot a small fireball.
