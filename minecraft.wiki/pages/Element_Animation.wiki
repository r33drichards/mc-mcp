== Trivia ==
* Following the first trailer for {{AMCM}}, many people assumed or asked if Dan would be reprising his role as the {{AMCM|villager}}s. Following this, he and the company confirmed that they had no involvement with the film.<ref>{{Tweet|Element|1831346524355256335|Answers to some of questions we keep being asked:<br>Nope, we're not playing the Villagers, we didn't help with the writing or anything like that, we're not involved in this movie. Yes, we'd have been up for it if we were asked. We think the movie looks fun!<br>There seems to be a lot of strong immediate reactions to the trailer, and of course there is!<br>Minecraft is personal for a lot of people, everyone has their own unique story in Minecraft and their own vision for how they imagine it. There would be no way to please everyone - and it'd be crazy to expect it to.<br>That being said, the whole point of this Movie is to be fun and entertaining, and it already is! This movie changes nothing about how you experience the game or your stories within it. It exists separately, it's the same with all the Youtubers and Streamers you might watch.<br>It looks bizarre - but how could it not? If the writing is good and respects the overall player base while also bring entertaining to people who haven't played Minecraft... it could be amazing. So we'll wait until we've seen it!<br>The realistic-style Minecraft world on this does look incredible. Mixing Minecraft with live action actors was always going to be difficult to pull off in any form, big well done to all the creative people involved.}}</ref>
** As the film released, they released special artwork approving of it, featuring many characters from Villager News enjoying the flick.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1417555059220787&set=pb.100028989206354.-2207520000&type=3|title=The #minecraftmovie pulled off something genuinely wild.
