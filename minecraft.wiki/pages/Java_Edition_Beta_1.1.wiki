'''Beta 1.1'''<ref group=note>Visible if the player manually adds <code>font.txt</code> into the broken <code>minecraft.jar</code>.</ref> is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]], released on December 22, 2010,<ref>{{twon|2415421531|Updated Client and Server to Beta 1.1|22 December 2010}}</ref> which added support for special events on specific dates during the holiday period as well as other changes and fixes.

Beta 1.1 was reuploaded 10 minutes after release as the original {{mono|[[minecraft.jar]]}} did not include the {{mono|font.txt}} file, making all text invisible in-game. However, this fix did not work because {{mono|font.txt}} was still missing. Notch released a third update a few minutes after that, [[Beta 1.1_01]], which fixed the issue.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[File:Christmas_2010_Cape.png|32px]][[File:New_Years_2011_Cape.png|32px]] [[2010 holiday capes]]'''
* Players who played during December 25th were shown with a Christmas-themed cape.
* Players who played during December 31st were shown with a purple fireworks-themed cape celebrating New Years 2011.
These capes were temporary server-side changes and not added to accounts. 

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Oak Leaves JE3 BE4.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Leaves]]'''
* Rewrote leaf decay.

== Removals ==
'''[[Font]]'''
* The {{mono|font.txt}} file was accidentally removed, leaving all text invisible in-game.

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed frame rate drops in singleplayer.
* Fixed players getting spammed with data then getting disconnected in multiplayer.
* Fixed an item duplication bug in multiplayer.
* Fixed "fancy" characters not working in the game by detaching font resources from the code.

* Beta 1.1 has the shortest wait for a major update to ''Java Edition'' in general, with only 2 days having elapsed since the release of [[Beta 1.0]] on December 20, 2010.
