'''cheapsh0t's Cape''' is a personal [[cape]].

== Appearance ==
The cape is almost identical to the [[Translator Cape]], but depicts a Japanese flag on its underside.

== Distribution ==
Unlike the similar-looking Translator and Chinese Translator capes, this cape was given to cheapsh0t for helping the Mojang Studios team when they visited Tokyo, Japan in September 2013.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140122053144/https://mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-meetup-tokyo/ マインクラフト東京： オフ会Withデベロッパー] - Mojang.com; September 6, 2013</ref><ref>{{tweet|jeb|388193350408757248|Back at the office after a 3-week honeymoon!
