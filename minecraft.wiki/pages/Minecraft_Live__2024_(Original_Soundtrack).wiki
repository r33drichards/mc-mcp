== Trivia ==
* Most tracks use leitmotifs of tracks from ''Minecraft'' and ''[[Minecraft Live: 2023 (Original Soundtrack)]]''.
** "Save the Date" is a remix of "Minecart Ride" (from ''Minecraft Live: 2023 (Original Soundtrack)'').
** "Looking Back and Forward", "A Minecraft Music" and "Minecraft Experience" are remixes of "Opening" (from ''Minecraft Live: 2023 (Original Soundtrack)'').
** "Looking Back and Forward" and "Minecraft Experience" both use the "[[Infinite Amethyst]]" leitmotif at 1:43 and 0:36 respectively.
** "Bundles" uses the "[[Puzzlebox]]" leitmotif.
** "Creakstep" is a "[[Pigstep]]" remix.
** "Devs Two" is a "[[Creator]]" remix.
** "End of Show" uses the "[[Relic]]" leitmotif.
* "Jens in a Boat" is named after a post-credit scene where [[Jeb]] leaves the Mojang studios in a boat. However, this scene was removed following the live broadcast, as the developer after-show was edited out and uploaded as a separate video.
** The scene is however still available in the ASL, BSL and audio description versions of the live.<ref>{{ytl|I4kSs8b41fM|&lsqb;ASL&rsqb; Minecraft Live 2024|Minecraft|September 28, 2024|t=5041}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|u55kple1DIw|&lsqb;BSL&rsqb; Minecraft Live 2024|Minecraft|September 28, 2024|t=5021}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|z0aMu2no7RY|&lsqb;Audio Description&rsqb; Minecraft Live 2024|Minecraft|September 28, 2024|t=4179}}</ref>
