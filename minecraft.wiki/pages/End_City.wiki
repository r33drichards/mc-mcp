{{relevant tutorial|Defeating an End city}}
'''End cities''' are tall [[structure]]s found on the [[Terrain features#Outer island|outer island]]s of [[the End]]. They are inhabited by [[shulker]]s and hold valuable [[#Loot|loot]], including [[Enchanting|enchant]]ed iron and diamond [[tool]]s and [[armor]]. '''End ships''', found in some End cities, are the only source of [[elytra]].

== Generation ==
End cities naturally generate all over the End's [[Terrain features#Outer islands|outer islands]]. They can easily be accessed by entering the [[End gateway]], but it is possible to cross the gap between the islands in other ways. They generate on the large islands, where [[chorus tree]]s grow. If the End gateway teleports the [[player]] to a small island, the player can get to the nearest large island by building, using [[elytra]], or throwing [[ender pearl]]s.

End cities usually generate in flat areas, in "midlands" or "highlands" biomes{{Note|End midlands and highlands are only considered different biomes on [[Java Edition]].}}, which are found on larger islands. One may find several cities clustered together, or travel for thousands of blocks before finding one. Unlike other structures, End cities are generated in a noticeable grid. They are located only in chunks numbered 0-8 ± a multiple of 20. For example one possible "cell" for an End city to be generated in is x_chunks=0-8 and z_chunks=80-88 which is equivalent to the coordinates x=0-128 and z=1280-1408. There can never be an End city at for example z=961-1279 or z=1409-1599 because it is outside any "cell".

{{Note|1=Relevant code: 
<pre>
int i = chunkX;
int j = chunkZ;
if (chunkX < 0) chunkX -= 19;
if (chunkZ < 0) chunkZ -= 19;
int k = chunkX / 20;
int l = chunkZ / 20;
Random random = this.worldObj.setRandomSeed(k, l, 10387313);
k = k * 20;
l = l * 20;
k = k + (random.nextInt(9) + random.nextInt(9)) / 2;
l = l + (random.nextInt(9) + random.nextInt(9)) / 2;
return i == k && j == l && this.endProvider.isIslandChunk(i, j);</pre>}}

End cities consist of tall skyscraper-like towers constructed out of [[End stone bricks]] and [[purpur block]]s. An End city may generate as a single tower by itself, or as a sprawling complex of inter-connected towers and pathways branching from a main tower. [[End rod]]s and [[ender chest]]s are the only source of light. Many shulkers spawn around the city, and guard its various treasures. Decorative [[banner]]s hang at the tops of some towers.

Several types of rooms can be found in an End city, and several different floors, including:

* '''Base floors''' which are empty floors found at the base of every city; they are three stories tall, with each room wider than the one below it.
* '''Banner rooms''' that have banners hanging on the outside, and a [[shulker]] attached to the ceiling.
* '''Small rooms''' that have nothing in them at all.
* '''Large rooms''' that have precarious parkour-like staircases often leading up to another tower or a loot room.
* '''Loot rooms''' that consist of two [[chest]]s with valuable [[#Loot|loot]] at the End of a small parkour area; some rooms may have one normal chest next to an [[ender chest]] instead.

There are two types of towers:

* '''Small towers''' that are hollow, consisting of a single [[purpur slab]] spiral staircase of sorts.
* '''Skyscrapers''' that consist of a treacherous double spiral staircase made of [[purpur slab]]s and [[End rod]]s; many shulkers spawn here.

An '''End ship''' is a floating, boat-like structure found alongside End cities. It is relatively small, but holds even more valuable treasure than the city itself.

=== Generation ===
Each direction of every tower of the End city has a 50% chance of generating a bridge, and the bridge itself has a 12.5% chance to generate an End ship.

When generated, the stern of the ship always faces toward the city and the bow always faces away. It generates in front of a bridge with a gated arch at the end, from which one can throw an [[ender pearl]] to reach the ship or build a bridge.

=== Structure ===
{{main|End City/Structure/Ship}}

The End ship is made of [[End stone bricks]] and [[purpur block]]s, just like the city's main towers. Their design resembles that of European square rig sailing ships, commonly seen during the golden age of exploration. Three [[shulker]]s spawn on the ship; one on the main deck, one behind the stern of the ship, and one in the treasure room.

==== Main deck ====
The ship's main deck amounts to less than half of the walkable space on the ship. A [[ladder]] leads up the mast to an empty crow's nest, about 20 blocks high. There are no sails connected to the mast. 

A [[dragon head]] sits at the bow of the ship, making this the only way to obtain the dragon head in [[Survival]] mode. There are two small staircases on the outside; one that leads up to the empty upper deck, and one that leads to the cabin below.

==== Aftercastle ====
The aftercastle contains a [[brewing stand]] sitting on a small table, with two [[potions of Healing]]. Another staircase leads below deck to the ship's "hotspot"; the treasure room.

==== Treasure room ====
The floor of the treasure room is lined with [[obsidian]]. There are four small windows on the sides. It contains two [[#Loot|loot chests]] and an [[item frame]] holding a pair of [[elytra]]; this is the only way to obtain elytra in Survival mode. A [[shulker]] guards the elytra and the two loot chests.

== Structure details ==
One may access the individual structures of an End city by utilizing [[structure block]]s to manually load city structures from the <code>data/minecraft/structures/end_city</code> folder in [[minecraft.jar]]. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter <code>end_city/''StructureName''</code> and press LOAD. The names of these structures and a small description is provided below:

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia == 
* Some End city rooms are structured similarly to [[wikipedia:Pagoda|traditional Asian pagodas]]. Jeb had visited the [[wikipedia:Summer Palace|Summer Palace]] before the release of [[15w31a]].<ref>{{Cite Instagram|jebkhaile|3D07UJpMOr|On our way in... #Beijing|May 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|jeb_|603175853795758080|In Shangai, having dinner with some of the Chinese Minecraft community members :) https://instagram.com/p/3JIaQxJMLq/}}</ref>
* The banners atop the towers have a magenta and black pattern that resembles the [[missing texture]]: [[File:Missing Texture.png|32px]]
* End cities can be over 100 blocks tall.
* On the End ship, there is a hole in the crow's nest atop of the mast, which is directly above a piece of magenta [[stained glass]] on the ship's deck. This is a relic feature from the early days of the ship's development, when the main loot inside the ship was a [[beacon]] that shoots its beam through the magenta glass and the hole in the crow's nest, creating a magenta beam. Although the beacon was replaced with the [[elytra]], the magenta glass and the hole remained unchanged.
* The reason on why End cities have [[beetroot seeds]] in their chests is because on [[Legacy Console Edition]]s of the game, the worlds were limited sizes, so they had to add a way to obtain [[beetroot]] in [[Survival]] worlds. They were then added to {{JE}} for parity reasons.
