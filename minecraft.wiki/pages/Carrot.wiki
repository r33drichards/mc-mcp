A '''carrot''' is a [[food]] item obtained from carrot crops that can be used to plant them, eaten or used as a crafting ingredient.

'''Carrot crops''' are planted in [[farmland]] and used to grow carrots.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Fortune#Seeds}}
Fully grown carrot crops drop 2 to 5 carrots ({{frac|3|5|7}} per crop harvested on average). Yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with [[Fortune]], with Fortune III harvesting an average of {{frac|5|3|7}} carrots.

The yield is calculated by a binomial distribution: 2 drops are fixed, then a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.
{{breaking row|Carrots|link=none|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[Village]] farm plots have a chance of having carrots. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:

{| class="wikitable"
! Village style !! Chance
|-
| {{EnvSprite|plains-village}} Plains || 30%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|snowy-village}} Snowy || 10%
|}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, and [[zombie villager]]s have a 2.5% ({{frac|1|40}}) chance of dropping either an [[iron ingot]], carrot, or [[potato]] when killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]]. This is increased by 1% ({{frac|1|100}}) per level of looting. This gives carrots the following chances of dropping:
* {{frac|1|120}} (about 0.83%)
* {{frac|7|600}} (about 1.17%) with Looting I
* {{frac|9|600}} (about 1.50%) with Looting II
* {{frac|11|600}} (about 1.83%) with Looting III

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|carrot}}

== Usage ==

=== Food ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management|title1=Hunger management}}

To eat a carrot, press and hold {{control|use}} while the carrot is selected in the [[hotbar]]. Eating a carrot restores {{hunger|3}} [[hunger]] and 3.6 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Farming ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Crop farming|title1 = Crop farming }}

Carrots can be [[farming|farmed]] and harvested on [[farmland]]. Planted carrots go through 8 [[Block tick|stages]] of growth, but only 4 ''apparent'' stages because the texture only changes upon reaching stages 3, 5, and 8 with stage 8 being the final, mature appearance.

Carrots require a [[Light|light level]] of 8 or greater to plant{{only|java}} and 9 or greater to grow. {{IN|Bedrock}} they can be planted at any light level, but need an [[Light#Internal light level|internal light level]] of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is [[hydrated]]. Using [[bone meal]] on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.

Crops break if pushed by a [[piston]] or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

If {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is <code>true</code>, [[rabbit]]s find mature carrot [[crops]]{{only|je}} / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1.{{only|be}} This reduces the growth stages by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.

=== Animal food ===
Carrots can be used to [[breed]] and attract [[pig]]s and [[rabbit]]s, and make baby pigs and rabbits grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

Carrots can be used to heal, grow, and increase temper of [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, and [[mule]]s, but does not breed them.

=== Villagers ===
Villagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 carrots to become willing.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a carrot into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
