== Crossovers ==
[[File:Mr. Minecraft.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Steve as he appears in Super Meat Boy]]
[[Steve]], sometimes referred to as "Mr. Minecraft" in the game is an unlockable character in the PC version of Super Meat Boy.<ref>[https://supermeatboy.fandom.com/wiki/Steve Steve] - Super Meat Boy Wiki | Fandom</ref> He has the ability to place blocks, but in turn he cannot run because it uses the same button (and also he was added before the [[Adventure Update]] came out).

Meat Boy appears in ''[[Minecraft]]'' as a [[skin]] in the [[Legacy Console Edition]] in [[Skin Pack 2 (PlayStation)|Skin Pack 2]], however he was removed on an unknown date and it didn't return in the Skin Pack 2 - Classic {{in|BE}}.

== Trivia ==
* [[Notch]] gave Steve his name for the game as a joke,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101103081620/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1390641415/weekend-activities Weekend activities] - Notch, October 4, 2010, Tumblr</ref> but the name later became official.
