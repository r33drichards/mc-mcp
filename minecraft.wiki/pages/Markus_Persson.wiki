'''Markus Alexej Persson''', more commonly known under the alias '''Notch''', is the original creator of ''[[Minecraft]]'' and one of the founders of [[Mojang Studios]]. He is no longer involved in the game since his departure from Mojang in 2014.

== Biography ==
Persson started programming at the age of seven, using his father's Commodore 128. He produced his first game (a text-adventure) at the age of eight, with the help of type-in programs. In 2005 he started working as a game developer for [[King|King.com]],<ref name="GSint">{{citation|url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/interview-markus-notch-persson-talks-making-i-minecraft-i-|title=Interview: Markus 'Notch' Persson Talks Making Minecraft|section=|website=[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/ Game Developer]|author=Alex Handy|date=March 22, 2010|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524201820/https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/interview-markus-notch-persson-talks-making-i-minecraft-i-}}</ref> which he left in 2009 to work as a programmer at Jalbum.

After the full release of ''Minecraft'' ([[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]]), Persson transferred creative authority of the game's development to [[Jens Bergensten]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011-12-02-notch-steps-down-as-lead-developer-on-minecraft-to-focus-on-new.html|title=Notch steps down as lead developer on Minecraft to focus on 'new project'|section=|website=[https://www.engadget.com/ Engadget]|author=Christopher Grant|date=December 2, 2011|quote=|archive-url=}}</ref> afterwards continuing to help out with ''Minecraft'' while also working on a new project.<ref>{{citation|url=http://notch.tumblr.com/post/13633493969/och-med-dom-orden-s%C3%A5-passar-jag-micken|title=Och med dom orden så passar jag micken.|section=|website=[https://web.archive.org/web/20210527152248/https://notch.tumblr.com/ The Word of Notch]|author=Markus Persson|date=December 2, 2011|quote=Personally, I will now rest for a while, then get back to work refreshed and eager.

Outside of work, Persson frequently took part in competitions, including {{w|Ludum Dare}} and the {{w|Java 4K Game Programming Contest}}.<ref> {{citation|url=http://www.mojang.com/notch/|title=Notch!|section=Hobby Programming|website=[http://www.mojang.com/ mojang.com]|author=Markus Persson|date=|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328021228/http://www.mojang.com/notch/}}</ref>

=== Departure from Mojang ===
Persson sold Mojang and all of its assets to Microsoft on September 15, 2014. In a blog post, Notch states "I love games and I love to program, but I don't make games with the intention of them becoming huge hits, and I don't try to change the world." He then goes on to say that "I've become a symbol. I don't want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don't understand, that I don't want to work on."<ref name=Notchnet>{{citation|url=http://notch.net/2014/09/im-leaving-mojang/|title=I’m leaving Mojang|section=|website=[https://web.archive.org/web/20140922190251/http://notch.net/ notch.net]|author=Markus Persson|date=September 15, 2014|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922063257/http://notch.net/2014/09/im-leaving-mojang/}}</ref>

Persson left Mojang on November 5, 2014, along with the other founders. He wrote that "as soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately."<ref name=Notchnet/>

Persson has not been involved with ''Minecraft'' since selling Mojang to Microsoft, and the company has [[Java Edition 19w13a#General_2|disassociated]] with him since 2019 following a series of controversial tweets on Twitter, with a spokesperson for Microsoft stating that Persson's comments and opinions do not reflect those of Microsoft or Mojang and are not representative of ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{citation|url=https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/minecraft-creator-excluded-from-anniversary-due-to-comments-and-opinions-exclusive-1203200050/|title=‘Minecraft’ Creator Excluded From Anniversary Due to ‘Comments and Opinions’ (EXCLUSIVE)|section=|website=[https://variety.com/ Variety]|author=Brian Crecente|date=April 19, 2019|quote=|archive-url=}}</ref> Persson had been known for making inflammatory tweets as early as 2016.<ref>https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/03/minecraft-creator-went-transphobic-rant-twitter-wasnt/</ref>

On August 15, 2024, Notch replied to a tweet, stating that he liked the change that Mojang made to the appearance of [[redstone torch]]es.<ref>{{tweet|CagilMartin|1824105523362644442|The updated redstone models have inverted cubes|August 15, 2024}}<br>{{tweet|notch|1824132555760865385|I like it!|August 15, 2024}}</ref> On September 29, 2024, Notch tweeted that the [[creaking]] “looks awesome”,<ref>{{tweet|ZYJ27726|1840342330542543242|Notch do u like the new drop of Minecraft?|September 29, 2024}}<br>{{tweet|notch|1840342744952078528|I haven't seen it, hang on|September 29, 2024}}<br>{{tweet|notch|1840343244690841687|The creaking?

== Trivia ==
*On June 1, 2011, Notch posted on Twitter that he was 2<sup>5</sup> years old.<ref>{{tweet|notch|75817816795787264|It's my birthday, and I'm turning 2^5 today! ez got me saké (for later) and breakfast (for now). :D <3|June 1, 2011}}</ref> 2<sup>5</sup> is 32, which was his age at the time.
*As of September 30, 2009, Notch is "a certified Open Water Diver."<ref name=illness/>
*Notch programmed the ''Minecraft'' [[splash|splash screen]] to display "Happy Birthday, Notch!" all day on June 1. This was [[Java Edition removed features#Special splashes|removed]] in [[Java Edition 1.8.5]].
*From [[Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1414]] until [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], Notch (or any player using his name in offline mode) would drop an [[apple]] along with his inventory when killed in singleplayer - a reference to a joke included in an unofficial [[crafting]] guide.<ref>https://echidnatribe.org/Minecraft/crafting.php (This is an unofficial recreation with the original domain)</ref> This feature never functioned in multiplayer, and thus broke entirely when singleplayer was converted to an internal server in snapshot [[12w18a]].
**Although Mojang has since distanced themselves from Notch and removed most references to him from the game, the associated bug tracker issue for this remains open.<ref>{{bug|MC-96781||Player with the name Notch does not drop an apple at death anymore}}</ref>

*At one point, Notch was scheduled to do an interview with LordKaT, an online personality at the time associated with {{Wikipedia|Channel Awesome}}. However, this fell through due to LordKaT being confused for another critic named Noah Antwiler, who had gotten into controversy in the months prior.<ref>{{YouTube link|OMSZ1TqgOIU|Noah Antwiler (Spoony) {{!}} Down the Rabbit Hole|Fredrik Knudsen|March 30, 2018}}</ref>
