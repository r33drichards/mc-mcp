'''13w39b''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], released on September 27, 2013<ref>{{link|url=https://www.mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w39a/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122053124/https://www.mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w39a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 13w39a (Updated with 13w39b!) |website=[[Mojang]] |author=Dinnerbone |date=September 26, 2013 }}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[13w39a]] snapshot.

== Changes ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart with command block]]'''
* Now only activates every 4 ticks (2 redstone ticks) when on a powered [[activator rail]].
* Changed the ID from <code>minecraft:hopper_command_block</code> to <code>minecraft:command_block_minecart</code>.

=== Command format ===
'''Syntax'''
* Added an alert telling the player to use item names when you spawn item in using its ID, due to soon becoming deprecated.

=== General ===
'''[[Achievement]]s'''
* The "Diamonds to you" achievement can now be obtained by throwing a diamond at a [[zombie]] with the <code>CanPickUpLoot</code> tag.

'''Main menu'''
* Added an alert in the main menu warning the player of a change in the far future, which will result in Minecraft requiring an OpenGL feature set version of 2.1 or higher.

* This is the final version to have the [[locked chest]] in it as it got removed in the [[Java Edition 13w41a|next snapshot]].
