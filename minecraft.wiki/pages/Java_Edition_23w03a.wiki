'''23w03a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.4]], released on January 18, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w03a|January 18, 2023}}</ref> which adds the {{cmd|ride}} command and new interaction methods in [[options]] screen, makes technical changes, and fixes bugs. This is the first snapshot released in 2023.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added <code>commandModificationBlockLimit</code>, defaults to 32768.
** Controls the maximum number of blocks changed in one execution of {{cmd|clone}}, {{cmd|fill}}, and {{cmd|fillbiome}} commands.

'''{{cmd|ride}}'''
* A new command to allow entities to start or stop riding other entities, syntaxes:
** {{cmd|link=none|ride <target> mount <vehicle>}}: makes a single target mount a single vehicle, fails if:
*** <code>vehicle</code> is a player;
*** <code>target</code> is already riding a vehicle;
*** <code>target</code> and <code>vehicle</code> are the same entity;
*** <code>vehicle</code> is already a passenger (direct or indirect) of <code>target</code>.
** {{cmd|link=none|ride <target> dismount}}: dismounts <code>target</code> from any vehicle it is riding, fails if <code>target</code> is not riding anything.

=== General ===
[[File:Accessibility Onboarding Screen 23w03a.png|thumb|Accessibility onboarding screen]]
'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Added an accessibility onboarding screen for players launching the game for the first time.
* Added arrow key navigation.
** Menu screens can now be navigated by using the arrow keys.
** When navigating with arrow keys, sliders need to be activated by pressing {{key|Enter}} or {{key|Space}} to start changing the value.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added a new "Notification Display Time" accessibility option, to change how long the notifications such as unlocked recipes, advancements, subtitles and selected item names are visible.

'''Protocol'''
* Added a network protocol feature for forcing bundle of packets to be processed within same client tick.
** Added new delimiter packet to clientbound game protocol.
** All packets between two delimiters are guaranteed to be processed within same tick.
** For security reasons this feature is not supported in serverbound direction.

'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added following biome tags:
** <code>#increased_fire_burnout</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|bamboo_jungle|mushroom_fields|mangrove_swamp|snowy_slopes|frozen_peaks|jagged_peaks|swamp|jungle}}.
*** Fire burns out faster in these defined biomes.
** <code>#snow_golem_melts</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|badlands|basalt_deltas|crimson_forest|desert|eroded_badlands|nether_wastes|savanna|savanna_plateau|soul_sand_valley|warped_forest|windswept_savanna|wooded_badlands}}.
*** Snow golems melt in these defined biomes.
** <code>#spawns_snow_foxes</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|snowy_plains|ice_spikes|frozen_ocean|snowy_taiga|frozen_river|snowy_beach|frozen_peaks|jagged_peaks|snowy_slopes|grove}}.
*** Snow foxes spawn in these defined biomes.
** <code>#spawns_white_rabbits</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|snowy_plains|ice_spikes|frozen_ocean|snowy_taiga|frozen_river|snowy_beach|frozen_peaks|jagged_peaks|snowy_slopes|grove}}.
*** White rabbits spawn in these defined biomes.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[skeleton horse]]s, and [[zombie horse]]s'''
* Changed their textures.

'''[[Vex]]es'''
* Now use a separate charging animation when empty-handed.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Armor stand]]'''
* Now preserve custom names when placed and broken.

'''[[Minecart with hopper]]'''
* No longer have <code>TransferCooldown</code> data.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Chat]] component'''
* Added an optional <code>fallback</code> field to <code>translate</code> text components.
** The new field is a string that is used in place of translation if it is missing.
** If <code>fallback</code> is missing, the old behavior (i.e. using the key itself as the translation) is preserved.
* Out-of-bound arguments in <code>translate</code> formats are no longer silently ignored.

'''{{cmd|clone}}'''
* Now supports specifying the source and target dimensions, new syntax:
** {{cmd|link=none|clone [from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> ...}}
*** <code>sourceDimension</code>: ID of dimension to clone from.
*** <code>targetDimension</code>: ID of dimension to clone to.

'''{{cmd|data}}'''
* New source <code>string</code> available, to read a value as text and resulting in a string value, syntax:
** <code>... ''(insert <index>|prepend|append|set|merge)'' string (block <sourcePos>|entity<nowiki> <source></nowiki>|storage <nowiki><source></nowiki>) [<sourcePath>] [<start>] [<end>]</code>
*** <code>start</code>: index of first character to include at the start of the string.
*** <code>end</code>: index of the first character to exclude at the end of the string.

'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* On <code>(if|unless)</code>, new conditions available:
** <code>... loaded <pos></code>: checks if the position given is fully loaded (in regard to both blocks and entities).
*** <code>pos</code>: block position to check.
** <code>... dimension <dimension></code>: checks if the execution is in a matching dimension.
*** <code>dimension</code>: a dimension ID.
* New sub-command: <code>on</code>, for selecting entities based on relation to the current executing entity, syntax:
** <code>... on (attacker|controller|leasher|owner|passengers|target|vehicle) -> execute</code>
*** <code>attacker</code>: last entity that damaged the executing entity in the previous 5 seconds.
*** <code>controller</code>: entity that is controlling the executing entity (for example: first passenger in a boat).
*** <code>leasher</code>: entity leading the executing entity with a leash (might be a leash knot in case of being attached to a fence).
*** <code>owner</code>: owner of the executing entity, if it is a tameable animal (like cats, wolves or parrots).
*** <code>passengers</code>: all entities directly riding the executing entity (no sub-passengers).
*** <code>target</code>: attack target for the executing entity.
*** <code>vehicle</code>: entity that the executing entity is riding.
** If the relation is not applicable to the executing entity or there are no entities matching it, selector returns zero elements.

'''{{cmd|title}}'''
* All time arguments to {{cmd|link=none|title times}} are now time durations and work with {{cd|d=and|t|s|d}} suffixes.

'''{{cmd|weather}}'''
* The duration of the weather change now matches the game's regular weather cycle if not specified.
* The <code>duration</code> parameter is now a time duration in ticks and works with {{cd|d=and|t|s|d}} suffixes.
** To retain existing functionality, you need to add an <code>s</code> suffix to pre-existing commands.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>11</code>.

'''[[Custom biome]]'''
* Removed <code>precipitation</code> precipitation type field.
* Added <code>has_precipitation</code> boolean field.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Auto-jump is now off by default.
* The resource pack screen is now keyboard-navigatable.

'''Protocol'''
* Clients now reset their secure chat session state when receiving the login packet.

'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added <code>#animals_spawnable_on</code> to the <code>#goats_spawnable_on</code> block tag.
* Renamed <code>#only_allows_snow_and_gold_rabbits</code> biome tag to the <code>#spawns_gold_rabbits</code>.

'''UI'''
* Slightly moved the search icon on the recipe book UI.
* Sliders can now be textured individually from buttons.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the 1.20 experimental data pack is enabled.

* Added following item tag:
** <code>#noteblock_top_instruments</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|zombie_head|skeleton_skull|creeper_head|dragon_head|wither_skeleton_skull|piglin_head|player_head}}.
