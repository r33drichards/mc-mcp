Pistons and sticky pistons have 2 technical blocks that cannot be obtained. These include the '''piston head''' and '''moving piston''' blocks.

The '''piston head''' is a technical block that appears as the front part of an extended piston. It is not available in the Creative inventory and does not drop anything when removed.

Normally, piston heads are created automatically when a piston extends. However, they can also be placed manually using the {{cmd|setblock}} command. Alternatively a [[debug stick]]{{only|je}} can be used to change the facing direction of a piston head that's currently attached to a piston base. Piston heads that do not have a valid support block behind them will be removed when receiving a [[Block_update#Post_placement_update|shape update]] from behind {{in|JE}}, or when receiving a [[block update]] from any direction {{in|BE}}. 

In rare cases, a client-side, duplicate piston head can appear when placing a piston next to a power source {{in|java}}, due to client-server desync issues.<ref>{{bug|MC-254385}}</ref> These client-side piston heads cannot be broken directly but can be removed by placing another block in the same location.

{{IN|java}}, normal and sticky piston heads are distinguished by a block state. {{IN|bedrock}}, they use separate block IDs. The normal and sticky piston heads can be obtained as items {{in|BE}} with the commands <code>/give @s pistonarmcollision</code> and <code>/give @s stickypistonarmcollision</code>. They face down when placed.

{{IN|BE}}, piston head blocks do not actually have a texture, as the piston arm texture is part of the piston [[block entity]], and piston heads that aren't connected to a piston base have neither collisions nor an [[interaction box]].

The '''moving piston''', also known as '''block 36''' due to its [[Java Edition data values/Pre-flattening/Block IDs|pre-flattening block ID]], is an unobtainable technical block that contains part of a piston head, and/or part of one or two blocks that the piston is carrying into or out of the grid cell (including blocks carried indirectly via [[slime block]]s). Since moving blocks vary in how much of each grid cell they occupy, they can't be stored as normal [[block]]s and are instead stored as [[block entities]]. At the end of the piston stroke, it gets replaced with either air, the piston head, or the carried block; but if it is placed through editing and no piston is connected, it remains indefinitely.

It is invisible and non-solid {{in|je}}, and cannot be broken without the use of [[commands]], [[TNT]], or a structure generating over it (such as the end platform). Although it is non-solid, fluids cannot pass through it. It also prevents players from building at its location. [[Mobs]] can see through it, but cannot walk through it. The game treats the block as a [[stone]] block when it comes to the player's footstep sounds. It is similar to [[invisible bedrock]] in properties with the exception that the player can walk through the moving piston but not invisible bedrock.

=== Block data ===
The moving piston has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

{{JE}}:
{{see also|Block entity format}}
<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
** {{nbt|compound|blockState}}: The moving block represented by this block entity.
*** {{nbt inherit/block state}}
** {{nbt|byte|extending}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the piston is extending instead of withdrawing.
** {{nbt|int|facing}}: Direction that the piston pushes (0=down, 1=up, 2=north, 3=south, 4=west, 5=east).
** {{nbt|float|progress}}: How far the block has been moved. Starts at 0.0, and increments by 0.5 each tick, including the tick on which moving the piston is created. If the value is 1.0 or higher at the ''start'' of a tick of the block entity (before incrementing), then the block transforms into the stored blockState. Negative values can be used to increase the time until transformation.
** {{nbt|byte|source}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) – true if the block represents the piston head itself, false if it represents a block being pushed.

== Trivia ==
* Mobs can spawn inside the piston head block.
* {{IN|bedrock}}, the piston head is invisible and non-solid when placed with commands. The moving piston cannot be placed with block placement commands in this edition.
* The <code>moving_piston</code> is transparent and does not emit light.
** If a light-emitting block is moved, the player can see it turn dark briefly. If an opaque block is moved, the player may see light passing through it.
