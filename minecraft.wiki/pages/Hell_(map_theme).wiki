'''Hell''' was one of the [[Indev map settings#Level themes|map themes]] available during ''Minecraft's'' [[Indev]] stage, and was eventually removed in the [[Infdev]] stage. The concept of a hell world re-surfaced when the development of [[Alpha 1.2.0]] began, with the introduction of the [[Nether]]. 

== Description ==
Unlike the other themes, Hell generated [[lava]] in place of [[water]]. The sky would also appear red, instead of blue. This map theme made gameplay considerably harder, as lighting levels were lower than the other themes, causing hostile [[mob]]s to spawn even during the day. [[Farming]] also took much longer and [[grass block]]s were scarce, usually generating only on the coastlines in place of sand. There were very few trees, but [[mushroom]]s were abundant on the surface.
