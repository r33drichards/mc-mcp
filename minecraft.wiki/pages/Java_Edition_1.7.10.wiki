== Trivia ==
* This is the first non-snapshot ''Java Edition'' version to have more than 3 digits on the version number since [[Beta 1.7_01]] in June 2011.
* With this revision, 1.7.10 became the first ''Java Edition'' release version to roll from single-digit to double-digit revision numbers, and the first ''Java Edition'' version since [[Alpha v1.0.10]], a mere four years prior.
** The next such version would be [[Java Edition 1.21.10]], released 11 years later.
* 1.7.10 remains one of two post-1.0 versions of ''Minecraft'' with the second highest ever patch number, tied with 1.21.10, only behind 1.21.11.
* This version was released on the same day as [[14w26c]].
* This is the first version with more than two pre-releases since [[Java Edition 1.0.0]].
