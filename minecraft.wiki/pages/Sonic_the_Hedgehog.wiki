'''''Minecraft'' x ''Sonic the Hedgehog''''' is a merchandise collaboration between ''[[Minecraft]]'' and the ''{{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog}}'' video game franchise, primarily set during the [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_30th_Anniversary 30th anniversary].

== Background ==
''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is a multimedia franchise, beginning in 1991 with the release of ''{{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog}}'' on the {{Wikipedia|Sega Genesis}}. The series revolves around the adventures of a blue hedgehog named {{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic}}, who frequently travels across the world to battle the industrialist supervillain {{Wikipedia|Doctor Eggman}}. Major characters within the franchise include {{Wikipedia|Tails (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Miles "Tails" Prower}}, Sonic's best friend and sidekick, {{Wikipedia|Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles}}, the last of a tribe of echidnas who protect the [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Emerald Master Emerald], [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Amy_Rose Amy Rose], a female hedgehog who wields a hammer and practices fortune telling, and {{Wikipedia|Shadow the Hedgehog}}, the ultimate lifeform created by [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Gerald_Robotnik Gerald Robotnik].

The franchise was created in an attempt to give {{Wikipedia|Sega}} a mascot character to compete with {{Wikipedia|Nintendo}}'s {{Wikipedia|Mario|Super Mario}}, with the majority of the games being platformers. Initially, Sonic games were exclusive to Sega’s own consoles, including the {{Wikipedia|Sega Genesis}} (known as the Mega Drive in Europe and Japan), {{Wikipedia|Master System}}, {{Wikipedia|Game Gear}}, {{Wikipedia|Sega Saturn}}, and the {{Wikipedia|Sega Dreamcast}}. However, after the commercial failure of the Dreamcast, Sega exited the console market in 2001.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/feb/01/4|title=Sega to end production of Dreamcast console|website=www.theguardian.com|date=January 31, 2001}}</ref> From that point on, Sonic games began appearing on multiple other consoles, including Microsoft’s {{Wikipedia|Xbox_(console)|Xbox}}, Sony’s {{Wikipedia|PlayStation 2}}, and Nintendo’s {{Wikipedia|GameCube}}. ''{{Wikipedia|Sonic Heroes}}'', which released in 2003, was the first Sonic game to be released across all three major console families.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/8702/sonic-heroes-to-use-renderware|title=Sonic Heroes to Use Renderware|website=www.nintendoworldreport.com|date=May 27, 2003}}</ref>

The Sonic franchise has become known for its many adaptations into other mediums, more than any other video game series. Two television shows premiered in 1993, ''{{Wikipedia|Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog}}'' and {{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog (TV Series)|Sonic the Hedgehog}}, with contrasting tones; the former being a slapstick comedy, the latter (commonly referred to by fans as "Sonic SatAM") a dark and serious action show. In promotion of the two series, {{Wikipedia|Archie Comics}} would produce a {{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)|comic book}} featuring elements of both, which would later distance itself from the source material and become the longest running comic based off a video game.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://archie-blogs.archiecomics.com/sonic/2008/07/from_the_cuinness_book_of_worl.html|title=SONIC THE HEDGEHOG ENTER BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS|website=archie-blogs.archiecomics.com|date=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912135723/http://archie-blogs.archiecomics.com/sonic/2008/07/from_the_cuinness_book_of_worl.html}}</ref> The Archie Comics series would conclude its run on December 28, 2016, with {{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog (IDW Publishing)|another}} comic, set within the continuity of the games, succeeding it the following year.

In 2020, a live action/animated {{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|film}} based off the series, starring {{Wikipedia|Ben Schwartz}} as Sonic and {{Wikipedia|Jim Carrey}} as Doctor Eggman. The film would prove to be a success, leading to numerous sequels and spin-offs, such as the ''{{Wikipedia|Knuckles (TV series)|Knuckles}}'' action-sports comedy mini-series.

=== World ===
{{Main|Sonic the Hedgehog (DLC)}}On June 14, 2021, a DLC map was released on the [[Marketplace]], to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog. Developed by [[Gamemode One]], the map aims to recreate a Sonic game using first person Minecraft framework, featuring levels set in [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Hill Green Hill], [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Chemical_Plant Chemical Plant], and [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Sky_Sanctuary Sky Sanctuary]. An update was released to coincide with the release of the film {{Wikipedia|Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2}}, adding a new mode set in [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Labyrinth_(Paramount) Labyrinth Zone]. 25 skins were included initially, with four more from the films being added alongside the new level.

=== Skin pack ===
{{Main|Sonic the Hedgehog Skin Pack}}On July 20, 2021, a second tie-in to the anniversary was released. Developed by ''[[The Hive]]'', the skin pack includes two skins of Sonic fans, wearing the logo of the event.

=== Texture pack ===
{{Main|Sonic Texture Pack}}On May 15, 2023, a [[Texture pack (downloadable content)|texture pack]] was released by Gamemode One, reusing the art style and certain models from the map. Notably, this map includes wholly new character designs, including a unique iteration of the character [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Mecha_Sonic_Mark_II Mecha Sonic] in place of the [[wither]].

=== Add-On ===
{{Main|Sonic Add-On}}On January 7th, 2025, an add-on was released by Gamemode One, which also reuses the art style and certain models from the map such as [[skin]]s and rings (the currency). The add-on holds new features such as a level editor which modifies the world in creating a parkour course with custom spikes and jump pads and a shop which allows the player to transform as Sonic or the crew.

[[File:Sonic the Hedgehog alongside various enemies.jpeg|thumb|Sonic, a Grabber, and [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Moto_Bug Moto Bug] in the event.]]{{Incomplete section|Minigames, items, and areas}}{{See also|Event servers}}Beginning on July 12th, 2021<ref>{{Cite|url=https://support.playhive.com/sonic/|title=The Hive x Sonic the Hedgehog|website=support.playhive.com|date=July 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210713174355/https://support.playhive.com/sonic/|quote=}}</ref>, ''Minecraft'' [[Featured servers|featured server]] [https://playhive.com/ The Hive] hosted an event crossing over with the Sonic franchise, in celebration of the 30th anniversary. The server contained six party minigames set inside Green Hill Zone: Chao Rescue, Ring Royale, Ring Dash, Red Light Green Light, Go Fast, and Badnik Range. Each party minigame was based on Chemical Plant Zone, Sky Sanctuary Zone, Speed Highway, Seaside Hill, Rooftop Run, or Planet Wisp. The minigames had background music that came from {{Wikipedia|Sonic Generations}} Act 2 stages.

The live event was originally scheduled to only be on July 16, however due to popular demand it was rerun on July 25th, with additional events being held in North America and Asia.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://updates.playhive.com/additional-sonic-live-events-4nPFFm|title=Additional Sonic LIVE Events|author=The Hive|website=updates.playhive.com|date=June 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725175021/https://updates.playhive.com/additional-sonic-live-events-4nPFFm}}</ref> The whole collaboration lasted for 2 weeks, concluding on the July 26th.

The hub, which the player joins in, was fully redesigned to match the Sonic aesthetic. Twenty parkour sections were readily available. All around the hub, including parkour, were Sonic-related currency: Rings. This could be used to buy custom permanent game-unlocks for other unrelated minigames.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://updates.playhive.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-event-is-ending-1EF1bW|title=Unlocks Being Permanent|author=The Hive|website=updates.playhive.com|date=June 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924122247/https://updates.playhive.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-event-is-ending-1EF1bW}}</ref> You could buy Sonic-themed cosmetics from the Ring Shop in the hub. The Ring Shop was loosely based on the Chao Garden's [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Black%20Market Black Market] from {{Wikipedia|Sonic Adventure}}, {{Wikipedia|Sonic Adventure 2}}, and even {{Wikipedia|Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity}}.
