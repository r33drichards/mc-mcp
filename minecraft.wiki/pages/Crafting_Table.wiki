A '''crafting table''' is a utility [[block]] that gives access to all [[crafting]] recipes, including many not available from the [[inventory]]'s crafting grid.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Crafting tables can be mined by hand or with any tool, but [[axe]]s are the quickest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Crafting Table|Axe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Crafting tables naturally generate in the following structures:
*[[Swamp hut]]s
*[[Igloo]]s
*[[Trail ruins]]
*[[Pillager outpost#Structure|Tent]]s outside [[pillager outpost]]s
*[[Trial chambers]] (a hidden chamber inside of the "Intersection 2" room)
*Some small [[village]] houses
**Only in [[savanna]], [[desert]], [[taiga]], and [[plains]]{{only|BE|short=1}} villages.

=== Crafting ===

|Output= Crafting Table
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Regardless of the player's position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the saws are facing west and north, while the one with the [[crafting]] grid is facing up).

=== Crafting ===

[[File:Crafting Table GUI.png|thumb|right|The GUI of the crafting table.]]

Pressing {{control|use}} on a crafting table opens the 3×3 [[crafting]] grid that allows the player to craft many more items than are available with the crafting grid in the [[inventory]], which is only 2×2.

The [[recipe book]] is available to the left of the crafting grid (collapsed by default {{in|lc=|java}}, expanded by default {{in|lc=|bedrock}}), which stores [[crafting recipes]] for reference and one-click crafting.

=== Fuel ===
Crafting tables can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per crafting table.

=== Repairing ===
[[File:How to repair tools using a crafting grid.png|thumb|right]]
{{main|item repair}}
A crafting table can be used to repair damaged [[tool]]s, weapons, and [[armor]]. When two damaged items of the same material are combined side-by-side in the crafting grid, they produce a new item with the sum of the durabilities plus a 5% bonus, with a maximum total of 100% durability for that item. Using this method does not require any [[experience]], but removes any [[enchantment]]s (like a [[grindstone]]) on either or both items except curse enchantments. The only way to retain enchantments is to repair damaged items on an [[anvil]].

=== Note blocks ===
Crafting tables can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* From version [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]] through version [[Java Edition 1.19.4|1.19.4]], the application icon for {{JE}} was a crafting table. As of version [[Java Edition 1.20|1.20]], the icon for ''Java Edition'' is now a [[grass block]] (for releases), or a [[dirt]] block (for snapshots).
* The original [[inventory]] screen before January 29, 2010 was the crafting table interface. There were no [[armor]] slots, no [[off-hand]] slot, no [[recipe book]], nor viewport of the player's [[skin]].
* The texture of the crafting table visually features a hammer, saw, and pliers. None of these tools are currently implemented in the game.
