=== Original ===
<poem><i>月が太陽に恋文を書いていた
ぎこちない言葉
君の光が最も明るく輝いた

星たちに囲まれてひとりぼっちの空
夜
あなたとまた会えるように
君の光を照らし続ける
約束

月が太陽と出会い愛情を求めて
今知った
これは最大距離で遥か溢れる気持ち消えなかった

星たちに囲まれてひとりぼっちの空
夜探してる
あなたとまた会えるように
君の光を照らし続ける
約束
</i></poem>

kimi no hikari o terashi tsuzukeru

tsuki ga taiyō to deai aijō o motomete

<poem><i>The moon wrote a love letter to the sun
Awkward words
Your light shined brightest

A lonely sky surrounded by stars
Night
So that i can see you again
Keep shining your light
Promise

The moon meets the sun and seeks love
I just found out
This is the maximum distance, and the overflowing feelings didn't disappear

A lonely sky surrounded by stars
Looking for the night
So that i can see you again
Keep shining your light
Promise
</i></poem>

== Quotes ==
{{Q|“total drag” introduces the final and last song, “tsuki no koibumi”, sung by Laura Shigihara. It’s about being together once more. Laura’s lyrics probably nail it. It’s about the Moon loving the Sun, yet they are constantly separated. The Moon just wishes to see the Sun again.|[[C418]]}}
