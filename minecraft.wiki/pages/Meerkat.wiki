}}The '''meerkat''' was a proposed mob that was featured in the Biome Chooser at [[MINECON Earth 2018]], alongside the [[termite]], [[ostrich]], and [[fox]]. It was a mob that would spawn in deserts, and was confused for a cat by [[Tiny Jens]].

It, along with the rest of the biome, lost the vote at only 15.2%.
