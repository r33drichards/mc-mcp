'''Beta 1.2_02''' is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]] released on January 21, 2011,<ref>{{twon|2857128986|Minecraft Beta 1.2_02}}</ref> that mainly changed where [[skin]]s are downloaded from.<br>
The version of Beta 1.2_02 in the [[launcher]] is missing its [[Wikipedia:META-INF|META-INF]] file, but is otherwise identical.

There is a [[Java Edition Beta 1.2 02 (20110517)|later instance of this version]], from May 17, 2011, which features many secret developer features.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
[[File:TGA screenshot example previewable.png|thumb|A screenshot taken by using {{key|Shift+F2}} in game.]]
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Pressing {{key|Shift+F2}} generates a 36450×17700 TGA format screenshot (which ends up being 1.8 GB, and no UI included). While the file is being generated, the game freezes and experiences major graphical distortions. This is unfinished test code, as confirmed by Notch.<ref>{{tweet|notch|28553723806490624|I just realized shift+F2 will generate an almost 2 gb large screenshot in 1.2_02. Half-finished huge screenshot test code.|January 21, 2011}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Lapis Lazuli Ore JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Lapis Lazuli Ore]]'''
* Now drops 4–8 [[lapis lazuli]] per block mined (increased from 1) on single player only (servers have not been affected yet).
* Can now be found at bedrock level.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Ink Sac JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Ink Sac]]'''
* Renamed from "Ink Sack".

'''[[File:Cocoa Beans JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Cocoa Beans]]'''
* Renamed from "Coco Beans".

=== General ===
'''[[Skin]]s'''
* Now downloaded from Amazon S3, instead of Minecraft.net.

== Trivia ==
* Prior to the 2018 skin update, Beta 1.2_02 was the oldest version in the [[launcher]] to have working [[skin]]s.
** However, if the player changed their skin after [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]], the last skin the player used prior to 1.8 would be displayed. This occurred in all versions after Beta 1.2_02 until [[Java Edition 1.3.1|1.3.1]]. It is currently unknown why this happened and why 1.3.1 was the oldest version to display post-1.8 skins.
