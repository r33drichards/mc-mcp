A '''block variant''' refers to a group of blocks with similar purposes. These can be thought of as types of blocks. Some of these block groups are blocks that share a lot of features in common, while others are simply for blocks that are similar or share a certain word in their name.

[[Block state]]s also allow some blocks to have variants.
