A '''shovel''' is a [[Tiers|tiered]] [[tool]] that can quickly break [[sand]], [[gravel]], and [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt]]-related blocks. Shovels also have a unique interaction with dirt-related blocks, and can turn them into [[dirt path]]s.

== Variants ==
There are seven shovel variants:
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Golden Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Stone Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Copper Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Diamond Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Shovel}}

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting

|B1 = {Any Planks}; Gold Ingot; {Any stone-tier block}; Copper Ingot; Iron Ingot; Diamond
|B2 = Stick
|B3 = Stick
|Output = Wooden Shovel; Golden Shovel; Stone Shovel; Copper Shovel; Iron Shovel; Diamond Shovel

=== Smithing ===
{{Smithing|head=1|Netherite Upgrade|Diamond Shovel|Netherite Ingot|Netherite Shovel|tail=1}}

=== Generated loot ===

=== Digging ===
A shovel can be used to break soil-type materials faster. Breaking a block with a shovel consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that break instantly, like [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s. Shovels have different amounts of uses based on the type:
* Wooden: 59 {{in|JE}}, 60 {{in|BE}};
* Golden: 32 {{in|JE}}, 33 {{in|BE}};
* Stone: 131 {{in|JE}}, 132 {{in|BE}};
* Copper: 191;
* Iron: 250 {{in|JE}}, 251 {{in|BE}};
* Diamond: 1,561 {{in|JE}}, 1,562 {{in|BE}};
* Netherite: 2,031 {{in|JE}}, 2,032 {{in|BE}}.

==== Speed ====
The following table summarizes the speed at which different quality shovels perform on different block types. Values with a red background indicate that no resource is dropped when the block is destroyed without a shovel. Values with a yellow backround mean that another resource is dropped with a shovel but not the block itself and green means that the block is dropped itself. 
{{breaking row|Clay|sort=1|simple=1|drop=0}}

{{Breaking row|Concrete Powder}}

{{breaking row|Suspicious Gravel|none}}
{{breaking row|Suspicious Sand|foot=1|none}}

=== Dirt paths ===
A shovel can be used to create a [[dirt path]] by {{control|using}} (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}

=== Campfires ===
A shovel can be used to extinguish a [[campfire]] or [[soul campfire]] by using (not digging) the shovel on it, losing one durability point.

=== Repairing ===

==== Anvil repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing with Anvils|Shovel}} 
A shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding units of the [[tiers]]' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two shovels of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s, unlike by crafting to repair.

=== Enchantments ===
A shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
