The '''Combat Update''' is the name for [[Java Edition 1.9]], a major update released on February 29, 2016.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|702096315552026624|We've updated the release date for Minecraft 1.9 to February 29!

Development on the Combat Update began at least a month before the [[Bountiful Update]] was released.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|654693140515827713|@MushirMickeyJoe @erismetis We started working on 1.9 before we released 1.8.

We started working on 1.9 long before we released the first snapshot.|Oct 15, 2015}}</ref> The development period was over twice as long as the development period for 1.8 at 576 days; 2015 became the first year where a major update to ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' was not released. Snapshots began the day after [[Java Edition 1.8.8|1.8.8]] was released. 56 development snapshots were released, from [[15w31a]] to [[16w07b]], making it the update with the most snapshots so far. The time between releases of 1.8 and 1.9 represent the longest time span between major updates, at 545 days. Fifteen iterations of the launcher were released during this period, from 1.5.2 to 1.6.59. [[Java Edition 1.8.9|1.8.9]] was also released during this period.

Mojang released the [[Java Edition 1.9-pre1|first pre-release]] on February 17, 2016.  The date for this was hinted at by the image in the blog post that announced snapshot [[16w06a]].  The data values of the wool in the image were (1, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 6), having a possible (though never confirmed) interpretation of "17-02-2016", a date just one week from 16w06a.  The [[Java Edition 1.9-pre2|second pre-release]] was released on February 18th, the [[Java Edition 1.9-pre3|third pre-release]] was released on February 24, and the [[Java Edition 1.9-pre4|fourth pre-release]] was released on February 26.
