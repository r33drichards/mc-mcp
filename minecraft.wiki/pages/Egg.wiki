An '''egg''' is an [[item]] that is dropped by [[chicken]]s and can be used to craft [[food]] items, such as [[cake]], and can be thrown for a chance to spawn baby chickens on impact. They have three variants based on the variant of the corresponding chicken: the standard egg for temperate chickens, '''brown egg''' for warm chickens, and '''blue egg''' for cold chickens.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Egg farming}}
Every adult [[chicken]] lays an egg item every 5–10 minutes, except for those that are or were part of [[chicken jockey]]s. The theoretical average would be expected at 1 egg every 7.5 minutes (9000 game ticks). The type of egg being laid depends on the chicken variant; temperate chickens lay normal eggs, cold chickens lay blue eggs, and warm chickens lay brown eggs.

A [[fox]] has a 3% chance of spawning with a normal egg in its mouth, which it drops upon death. Alternatively, a player dropping a food item causes the fox to drop the egg.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Any Egg, Egg}}

=== Combat ===
Players are able to throw eggs and deal knockback to [[mob]]s (but not other players{{only|JE|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-3179|||WAI}}</ref>), but no damage is dealt, similar to a [[snowball]]. Likewise, throwing eggs at [[neutral mobs]] provokes them. Eggs can also be fired from [[dispenser]]s and are affected by gravity. Eggs thrown through fire or lava {{in|BE}} catch fire, and set fire to entities they hit.

=== Spawning chickens ===
When thrown by a dispenser or by pressing the {{control|use}} button, an egg has a {{fraction|1|8}} (12.5%) chance of spawning a [[chick]]. If this occurs, there is a {{fraction|1|32}} (3.125%) chance of spawning three additional chicks (on average, 1 out of every 256 eggs spawns 4 chicks). In other words, whenever an egg is thrown, there is a {{fraction|31|256}} chance of spawning 1 chick and a {{fraction|1|256}} chance of spawning four chicks.

The chick variant depends on which egg variant was thrown; regular eggs hatch temperate chicks, blue eggs hatch cold chicks, while brown eggs hatch warm chicks.

The expected value of the number of chicks an egg produces is {{fraction|35|256}} or 13.7%. This means that on average, a chick is spawned every 7.3 eggs, a stack of 16 eggs spawns 2.188 chicks, and a full inventory including the hotbar and off-hand (37 &times; 16 = 592 eggs) is expected to spawn approximately 81 chicks.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|-spawn egg|-dragon egg|-turtle egg|-sniffer egg|-frog}}

== Trivia ==
* Eggs break mid-fall if hit by another projectile; the chance of spawning a chick is not affected.
* A thrown egg faces toward the [[player]] in first-person view, while it appears rotated horizontally in third-person view. This is the case for all throwable [[item]]s ([[ender pearl]]s, eggs, [[snowball]]s, and all throwable [[potion]]s).
