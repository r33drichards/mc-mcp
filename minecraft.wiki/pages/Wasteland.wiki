A '''wasteland''' is a desolate biome added in [[24w14potato]]. It generates in the [[Potato dimension]].

== Description ==
No trees generate in the wasteland. Surface of this biome is covered in a variety of blocks, including [[peelgrass]] and [[corrupted peelgrass]] blocks, [[slime block]]s, as well as green, gray and light gray [[blocks of potato peels]]. Brown and red [[mushroom]]s, [[potato flower]]s and normal [[potato]] plants grow on top of peelgrass blocks.

All [[water]] in wasteland, either naturally generated or placed by players, is poisonous: all entities in it (except [[toxifin]]s and [[plaguewhale]]s) are given the [[Poison]] effect for 2 seconds. Rain in wasteland has the same effect. Water placed inside of a [[cauldron]] is not poisonous.

Water that naturally generates in the wasteland biome is replaced with waterlogged [[light block]]s, causing the water to glow.

Many terrain features are unique to wastelands. These include:
*"Large potato columns" - columns of blocks of black potato peels, based on [[large basalt columns]].

*"Large potatostone" - a spire of [[terre de pomme]] with varying height, based on [[large dripstone]].
:[[File:Large potatostone.png|256px]]
*"Small debris columns" - a small column of [[ancient debris]].

*"Twisted potato" - a [[powerful potato]] with [[weak roots]] growing from it.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:

{{Spawn table
|edition=java
|monster=
{{Spawn row|Toxifin Slab|weight=25|size=1-4}}
{{Spawn row|Giant|weight=10|size=1-4|note=Giants can’t actually spawn, since they simultaneously require a light level greater than 11 and less than 8.}}
{{Spawn row|Slime|weight=5|size=1-2}}
{{Spawn row|Wither Skeleton|weight=5|size=1|note=Due to how bright this biome is, chances for the wither skeleton to find a valid spawn location are very low.}}
