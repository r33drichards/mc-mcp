* Updated [https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit/ Editor Extension Starter Kit] to include samples for custom brushes and {{cd|SimpleToolWrapper}}.

== Fixes ==

* Fixed bug for when a player switched to Test World while in the Nether/End the worlds dimension incorrectly changed to the Overworld.
