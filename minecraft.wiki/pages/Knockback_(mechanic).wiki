'''Knockback''' represents the pushback from attacks or natural causes.

== Attack knockback ==
When receiving damage from players, [[mob]]s, [[explosion]]s, and most [[projectile]]s, entities are also knocked back. The direction of knockback is determined by the direction of the incoming attack.

=== Versus grounded entities ===
Knockback dealt to grounded entities knocks them into the air and away from the attack.

=== Versus airborne entities ===
Knockback dealt to airborne entities differs between {{JE}} and {{BE}}. {{IN|JE}}, knockback against airbone entities only knocks them away from the attack and does not knock them further into the air. {{IN|BE}}, knockback against airborne entities is identical to knockback against grounded entities.

=== Versus entities in vehicles ===
Entities inside [[minecart]]s or [[boat]]s, as well as entities that are riding mountable entities like [[horse]]s and [[camel]]s, never receive any knockback when attacked.

=== Versus entities during attack invulnerability time ===
Knockback dealt to entities during [[Damage#Invulnerability timer|attack invulnerability time]], the 0.5 seconds (500ms) of invulnerability received after taking [[damage]], differs between {{JE}} and {{BE}}.
* {{IN|JE}}, knockback against invulnerable entities is completely negated, except for when attacking with a [[sword]] or [[spear]] that has the [[Knockback]] enchantment.
* {{IN|BE}}, knockback against invulnerable entities is applied in the same way as non-invulnerable entities, which results in high CPS (clicks per second) dealing massive knockback.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-170242||Clicking fast when hitting mobs results in insane knockback}}</ref> Note that certain [[featured servers]] available on Bedrock Edition opt to fix this bug, however the bug is present in a fully vanilla multiplayer setting.

== Knockback sources ==
=== Natural damage ===
Most [[Damage#Natural damage|natural damage]] sources, damage sources that are received indirectly, cause a stutter in movement but do not deal any horizontal knockback. Natural damage sources that cause a movement stutter include damage from burning, drowning, lightning, falling, suffocation, entity cramming, starvation, and [[status effect]]s like [[Poison]], [[Wither (effect)|Wither]], and [[Instant Damage]]. Block-inflicted damage from [[fire]], [[cactus]], [[lava]], [[magma]] blocks, [[campfire]]s, and [[sweet berry bush]]es also cause the same movement-stuttering knockback.

Other indirect damage sources deal knockback in the traditional manner rather than causing a movement stutter. This includes the breath attack of the [[ender dragon]], the beam attack of [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s, the sonic boom attack of [[warden]]s, the roar attack of [[ravager]]s, [[evoker fang]]s, damage from the [[Thorns]] enchantment, and the effect cloud from [[lingering potion]]s of Harming.

Knockback received from players or mobs using a sword enchanted with [[Knockback]] is greater than normal.

=== Damageless attacks ===
Attacks that deal {{hp|0}} or less fail to deal knockback. The [[Weakness]] status effect can cause attacks that deal {{hp|0}}, causing them to deal no knockback.

=== Snowballs and eggs ===
Thrown [[egg]]s and [[snowball]]s cause knockback to mobs even if they do not deal any damage. {{IN|BE}}, thrown eggs and snowballs also apply knockback to players.

== Sprint-knockback attack ==
[[File:Sword sprint knockback attack.gif|thumb|Performing a sprint-knockback attack.]]
Doing a [[melee attack]] while [[sprinting]] causes a sprint-knockback attack to be performed, inflicting extra knockback. {{IN|JE}}, sprint-knockback attacks play a unique sound when performed, and they require an attack cooldown charge of at least 84.8%. [[Spear]]s are the only item type that cannot do sprint-knockback attacks.

In {{JE}}, sprint-knockback attacks cannot be performed at the same time as critical hits or sweep attacks. If a sprint-knockback attack is performed at the same time as a critical hit, the sprint-knockback attack takes priority. They can however be performed at the same time as [[smash attack]]s and [[crushing blow]]s.

The extra inflicted knockback stacks with the [[Knockback]] enchantment. Like the Knockback enchantment, sprint-knockback attacks do not increase knockback against entities that are immune to knockback, such as [[iron golem]]s or shielding [[player]]s. The only exceptions to this are [[armor stand]] and [[boat]]s, which ordinarily do not take knockback when hit but do when hit by a sprint-knockback attack.

== Knockback resistance ==
=== [[Attribute]]s ===
==== Knockback resistance ====
Knockback resistance reduces knockback by multiplying the velocity value that a mob receives from an attack's knockback. If the velocity the mob would have without any knockback resistance is <math>v</math>, and the mob has a knockback resistance of <math>r%</math>, then the mob's actual velocity is determined by the formula <math>A = v \times \left(1 - \frac{r}{100} \right)</math>. Each piece of [[netherite armor]] adds 10% knockback resistance to its wearer, giving 40% knockback resistance with a full set.

==== Explosion knockback resistance ====
{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
Explosion knockback resistance reduces knockback from explosions and fireworks. It is received through the [[Blast Protection]] enchantment, and uses the formula {{cd|(15 × ''level'')%}}. The effect stacks with multiple armor pieces, with two pieces of Blast Protection IV armor resulting in 100% explosion knockback resistance. It also reduces the knockback affect of [[wind charge]]s and the [[Wind Burst]] enchantment.

=== Natural knockback resistance ===
{{main|Mob}}
[[Mob#Knockback_resistance|Certain mobs]] have natural knockback resistance that causes them to resist knockback from attacks. [[Iron golem]]s, [[shulker]]s, [[agent]]s, [[NPC]]s, [[warden]]s, and [[ender dragon]]s have 100% knockback resistance, while other mobs have varying levels of knockback resistance.
