A '''lily pad''' is a plant [[block]] found in [[swamp]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s and as [[fishing]] loot. It can only be placed on [[water]] or [[waterlogged]] blocks and can be stood on as a platform.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Lily pads can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] with anything. They also break from collisions with [[boat]]s.
{{breaking row|Lily Pad|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Lily pads can be found naturally on [[water]] in [[swamp]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, and [[wheat]] farm rooms of [[woodland mansion]]s.

{{block distribution}}

===Fishing===
{{Main|Fishing#Items obtainable}}
Lily pads are obtainable through fishing, with a 1.9% chance per attempt. See [[fishing]] for more details.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 5 lily pads for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Lily pads can be used to make paths over [[water]] without having to build bridges or use full [[block]]s. [[Mob]]s cannot spawn on lily pads. A lily pad is broken and [[Drops|drops as an item]] when water flows on it.

Normal blocks can be placed on the bottom side of lily pads (from below). This breaks the lily pad (dropping it as an item), but leaves the block in place.  Blocks can also be placed on top of lily pads, though the placed block appears to hover over the pad rather than rest on it.<ref>{{bug|MC-14156}} Resolved as works as intended</ref>

A lily pad can be used as a starting point for construction on an ocean surface without having to build up from the ocean floor (see also [[kelp]] for this purpose).

Lily pads are the only solid block that doesn't prevent [[fishing#Junk and treasure|fishing treasure items]] from water near it.

=== Placement ===
Lily pads can be placed only on top of [[water]], [[ice]] or [[frosted ice]]. Lily pads occupy the block above water and are not part of the water block itself.

Lily pads must be directly planted on the top of a water, ice or frosted ice block; unlike most blocks, targeting the side of a block that would result in it being placed on top of a valid block does not allow it to be placed. Similarly, targeting the sides or bottom of a block that can support a lily pad will place the lily pad on top.<ref>{{bug|MC-136405}}</ref> {{IN|Java}}, lily pads can be placed on waterlogged blocks, including top half slabs.

A lily pad faces a consistent direction that depends on its location; it is unaffected by the direction the [[player]] faces. Replacing a lily pad does not change the direction.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, unlike most blocks entities can collide with, lily pads can be placed directly inside players.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-32638}} Resolved as works as intended</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-112516}}</ref>

=== Composting ===
Placing a lily pad into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Appearance ==
* In the inventory, lily pads have the color: {{Color|#71c35c}}.
* Otherwise, lily pads have the color: {{Color|#208030}}.

== Trivia ==

* When lily pads are placed on [[water]] source blocks that do not take up the space of the entire block (when the water is flowing to the block next to it), the lily pad appears floating above the water source block.
*The lily pad is the only block with a height that is not an integer multiple of 1/16 (size of one pixel on the default texture pack). It is 1.5 pixels high, or 3/32 of a block.
