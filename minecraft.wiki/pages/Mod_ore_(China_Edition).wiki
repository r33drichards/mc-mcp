'''mod_ore''' is a block used for developing ores, addons (modpc), etc. It is only available {{in|ce}}. It uses the same texture as the [[block of gold]].

== Obtaining ==
The mod_ore block can only be obtained via [[commands]].

=== Breaking ===
{{Missing information|the block's breaking time}}
The block takes about 2 seconds to mine by hand.{{More info}}

When mined, the mod_ore block does not drop anything, regardless of the tool used. The item will only drop when [[explosion|exploded]] or using the {{cmd|setblock}} destroy command.<ref>{{ytl|GXwLg-vHbdU&ab}}</ref>

== Features ==
* The "0" in the item's nickname "<code>tile.mod_ore.0.name</code>" can be changed depending on the data value.
** If the item's data value exceeds "<span class="explain" title="(2 ^ 15) - 1">32767</span>", it will continue to reset to "0".
** Using {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}} does not affect the "0" in "tile.mod_ore.0.name".

* When placed, it may create a transparent black square with other blocks or with that block (old versions).
* In the 1.20 version of the Chinese edition of Minecraft, it emits update block particles when walking, but when mined, it produces golden_block particles.
* When placing the block, the texture of a gold block will appear, but after 0.1 seconds, it will change to the update_block texture. And when using setblock with mod_ore, the texture of the gold block is allowed. However, when placed normally (not through modpc), the texture displayed is the block update texture.
* When the block appears with the "unknown" texture and the player moves, the original movement speed is reduced (movement is affected). However, when the block appears with the "golden_block" texture and the player moves, the movement is not affected (normal movement speed).
