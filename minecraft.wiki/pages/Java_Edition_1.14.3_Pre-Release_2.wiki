'''1.14.3 Pre-Release 2''' (known as '''1.14.3-pre2''' in the launcher) is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.14.3]], released on June 7, 2019,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-14-3-pre-release-1?2|Minecraft 1.14.3 Pre-Release 2|June 7, 2019}}</ref> which makes changes to [[patrol]]s and [[villager]] panic behavior, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Panicked villagers now have to work and sleep so they cannot be in a state of panic all the time.
* The "last slept" and "last worked" properties for villagers are now saved properly.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]] is no longer required for the "How Did We Get Here?" advancement.

'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* [[Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], and [[Blast Protection]] are now mutually exclusive again, as they were prior to [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]].

'''[[Illager patrol]]s'''
* [[Vindicator]]s are no longer part of patrols.
* Doubled the minimum time to spawn from 5 minutes to 10–11 minutes.
* Patrols now follow hostile mob spawning rules.
** Patrols no longer spawn if the block light level disallows monster spawning.
** Patrols are now allowed to spawn in any biome except mushroom biomes.

=== General ===
'''[[LWJGL]]'''
* Updated to 3.2.2.
