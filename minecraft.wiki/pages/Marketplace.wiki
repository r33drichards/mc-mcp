The '''Marketplace''' (known as the '''Store''' on PlayStation) is an in-game platform where [[player]]s can purchase access to content<ref>[https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace Minecraft Marketplace]</ref> created by both Minecraft and members of the [[Minecraft Partner Program]].

== Minecoins ==
{{Main|Minecoin}}
'''Minecoins''' are the digital currency used to make purchases in the Marketplace and [[Character Creator]] platforms.

Most content in the Marketplace costs money, and are purchased using Minecoins, although some are not required.

== Requirements ==
The Marketplace is a service that can only be accessed by players that meet these requirements:

* The player must have purchased the full version of ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''.
* The player must have a stable internet connection.
* The player is using a version of ''Bedrock Edition'' that supports the Marketplace.

== Content ==
[[File:Ore UI - Play Screen "Worlds" Tab - Create From Template Button Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|501x501px|thumb|The [[Select World#Worlds|Play Screen]] in [[Tutorial:Menu screen/Bedrock Edition#Create from template|Create from Template]] screen menu {{in|Bedrock}}]]
There are 5 different categories of content available on the Marketplace, including [[skin pack]]s, worlds, [[add-on]]s, [[Texture pack (downloadable content)|texture pack]]s, and [[mash-up pack]]s. All purchased content instantly syncs to your Microsoft account unless you are not signed into your Microsoft and console account,<ref group="note" name="consoles">Such as on Nintendo Switch or PlayStation systems.</ref> in which case it is saved locally to the player's device.

All content is submitted by official ''[[Minecraft]]'' partners and is approved by the ''Minecraft'' Content Team.

=== Skin Packs ===
{{Main|Skin pack}}
Skins Packs are collections of custom skins that players can use in both singleplayer and multiplayer games. Depending on the specific content, some Skin Packs provide 1 or 2 free skins for you to use without needing to purchase.

=== Worlds ===
Worlds are pre-built maps that offer wide variety of in-game experiences. Not to be confused with Mash-up packs, Worlds can also include custom textures, blocks, items and mobs and be bundled with bonus skins.

==== Dynamic worlds ====

Dynamic worlds don't have a set build like normal pre-built ones, instead they can be generated like a ''Minecraft'' world. These worlds allow for a whole new experience every time because they generate differently depending on the seed. Sometimes they also include add-ons and texture packs as well. 

==== Adventure maps ====
Adventure maps are self-contained experiences that focus on exploring and other types of guided gameplay. These types of worlds can range from PvP arenas to simulators and can be designed for singleplayer, multiplayer or both.

==== Mini-Games ====
Mini-Games are compact worlds with a specific theme or goal that are designed to be repeatable. These can feature a set of different gamemodes and variants or be designed to reset continuously.

==== Survival Spawns ====
Survival spawns are starter maps that players can explore, gain loot from and expand. Maps of this type can sometimes add an entirely new aspect to the game but still allows players to experience the world as they normally would in survival mode.

=== Texture Packs ===
{{Main|Texture pack (downloadable content)}}
Texture Packs allow players to change the visual appearance of worlds. These packs can also customize other in-game elements such as sounds, items, the GUI and the geometry/ shape of mobs. Texture Packs are only able to alter existing features in ''Minecraft'' and cannot add new mobs, blocks or items.

=== Mash-up Packs ===
{{Main|Mash-up pack}}
Mash-up Packs are special bundles that combine a world, texture pack and skins. Unlike Worlds, texture packs included in Mash-up Packs can be used across other singleplayer worlds and even servers.

=== Add-ons === 
{{Main|Add-on}}
Add-ons are resource and behavior packs that can add new items, blocks, and mobs. Add-ons can be added to any world. They can be played and accessed on both singleplayer and multiplayer.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|projects=MCPE}}

== Trivia ==
* Before the ''[[Minecraft]]'' Marketplace was introduced, real money was used to buy the in-game [[mash-up pack]], [[Texture pack DLC|texture pack]]s and [[skin pack]]s. When [[Mojang Studios]] did it this way, all of the content had to pass certification on every single platform. The Marketplace and Minecoins were introduced to avoid this. 
** Players can still buy them using real money directly by purchasing the corresponding amount of Minecoins on the pack purchase page.
** Any packs that were bought before the Marketplace was introduced are marked as "Owned (P)" instead of "Owned". 
*** Packs that are marked as "Owned (P)" do not sync across devices.
* Skins, add-ons and worlds downloaded from the Marketplace are not stored in the {{cd|skin_packs}}, {{cd|behavior_packs}}, {{cd|resource_packs}} or {{cd|minecraftWorlds}} folders in [[com.mojang]]. They are instead stored in the {{cd|premium_cache}} folder and are encrypted.
* The map ''Beyond: Platformer'' claims to have been awarded a "Diamond Pick" award, citing "innovation and fun!" No other recipients of this award are known to exist.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp?id=f1ecf12b-1b6f-4794-a8de-24dfb82e6f25|title=Beyond: Platformer|author=StarkTMA|website=Minecraft Marketplace|date=April 28, 2023}}</ref>
