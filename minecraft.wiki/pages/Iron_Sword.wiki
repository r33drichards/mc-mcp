An '''iron sword''' is a variant of [[sword]] crafted from [[iron ingot]]s. It is the third-highest [[tier]] of sword, dealing more damage and having more durability than [[stone sword|stone]] and [[copper sword|copper]] swords.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
{{Main|Drops#Equipped items}}
A [[vex]] never drops its iron sword, because its main hand's {{cd|HandDropChances}} value is {{cd|0}}. This is not affected by the Looting enchantment.

{{IN|be}}, [[pillager]]s and [[vindicator]]s that spawn from raids have a 4.1% chance (or a 5.12% chance on Hard difficulty) of dropping a damaged iron sword. This sword has a 50% chance of being enchanted.{{Needs testing|With what level of enchantment? Actually, that's a super hard question to answer in BE. Can the iron sword have treasure enchantments?}}

In both editions, [[zombie]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, and [[husk]]s have a random chance to spawn with an iron sword. The zombie has an 8.5% chance to drop the sword; this chance is also affected by Looting, with each level increasing the chance by 1% (11.5% with Looting III).

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|iron-sword,level-enchanted-iron-sword,damaged-random-enchanted-iron-sword}}

=== Crafting ===
An iron sword is crafted using 1 [[stick]] and 2 [[iron ingot]]s.

=== Trading ===

{{Trade sources|Enchanted Iron Sword}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
{{main|Sword#Breaking}}
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.<ref>{{bug|MC-195168||Swords consume double durability than they normally would when destroying bamboo saplings, bamboo, or cobwebs}}</ref>

If a sword is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], either using [[Creative]] or [[commands]], cobwebs the sword destroys drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.

==== Creative mode ====
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as [[minecart]]s, [[painting]]s, [[item frame]]s,{{only|java}} and [[armor stand]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-27140}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-18463}}</ref>

=== Attacking ===
{{main|Sword#Attacking}}

An iron sword is used to deal [[damage]] to mobs and entities by {{control|attacking}} them. The iron sword has {{hp|6}} base damage {{in|je}} and {{hp|7}} base damage {{in|be}}, and can be enchanted to deal more damage. The following tables show how the [[Sharpness]] enchantment affects the damage dealt by the sword.

An iron sword can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]]s, with each repair material restoring 25% the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron swords can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the sword's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
An iron sword can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
