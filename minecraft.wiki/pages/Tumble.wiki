New Minecraft Mini Game Available Now|website=Xbox Wire|author=Rebecca Gordius|date=August 30, 2016}}</ref> is a [[mini game]] most similar to the popular "[[Spleef]]" mode on {{el|je}} servers, where players aim to cause others to fall off of an arena by using [[snowball]]s, [[shovel]]s, or other items to mine the ground below them. Tumble was added to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] on August 30-31, 2016. 

== Description ==
[[File:Tumble.png|thumb|300px|Gameplay of the Tumble mini game.]]
Similar to [[Battle (mini game)|Battle]], a Tumble game is divided into three rounds. The object of the game is to remove blocks from under other players, causing them to fall in a last-person-standing scenario. The default Tumble mode encompasses a single, large platform where players use [[shovel]]s to remove blocks. Other modes include competing on three smaller platforms, throwing [[snowball]]s, using [[firework rocket]]s, or throwing [[splash potion]]s with the [[Levitation]] effect. All blocks are broken immediately by a shovel, snowball, or [[potion]]. The sole exception is [[TNT]], which act as both a pitfall and an explosive that can be used to destroy lower platforms, if enabled.

Up to 8 players can join a single game on most platforms, with ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'' allowing a maximum of 4, as the only exception.

=== Game modes ===
* '''Shovels''', where everybody has shovels, one life, and a single layer.
* '''Snowballs''', where everybody has snowballs, one life, and 3 layers.
* '''Mixed''', where in the lobby people can vote either to play snowballs or shovels.

As of [[Xbox 360 Edition TU58|TU58]] and equivalent updates ([[Xbox One Edition CU51|Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 3 Edition 1.60|PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4 Edition 1.57|PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation Vita Edition 1.57|PlayStation Vita]], [[Wii U Edition Patch 28|Wii U]], [[Nintendo Switch Edition 1.0.8|Nintendo Switch]]) the "Custom" game type allows the host to change these settings:

* Lives per Round (1 through 10)
* Spectator Mode (Invisible, [[Bat]], [[Parrot]], [[Vex]], [[Player Head|Head]])
* Item Set (Shovels, Snowballs, Fireworks, Levitation Potions)
* Layer Scale (Auto, ×1, ×1.25, ×1.5, ×1.75, ×2)
* Layer Count (Auto, 1 through 8)
* "Spectator Participation" checkbox. When enabled, spectators can slowly break blocks.

After a certain amount of time, Showdown mode begins, like in Battle mode. Player names are shown during this period. When shovels (including Custom games) are enabled, they are replaced with snowballs.

=== Events ===
Various special events can occur in the Tumble mini game with themed layers and an applied [[Texture pack (downloadable content)|Texture]]/[[Mash-up pack]]. The event theme is decided by the host of the game's local date. All players in that session will also have the event applied regardless of their local date. 

* The Halloween Arena is displayed around Halloween, from an unknown date to November 3, and uses the [[Halloween Mash-up|Halloween 2015 Mash-up pack]].
* The Festive Arena is displayed from Christmas (December 24) to an unknown date and uses the [[Festive Mash-up]].
* The Birthday theme is displayed for [[Xbox Edition|Xbox Editions]] around May 9 (''Xbox 360 Edition''{{'}}s release date) and uses the [[Texture pack (downloadable content)|Cartoon Texture Pack]].
** The same is applied for [[PlayStation Edition|PlayStation Editions]] and [[Nintendo Edition|Nintendo Editions]] from December 17 (the release date for both ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' and ''Wii U Edition'') to December 23.

== Music ==

== Trivia ==
* A player joining a game with fireworks enabled in Tumble can perform a laggy "burst" shot, that can launch the player into the sky if timed correctly or if the client or host is laggy.
* In Tumble, having lives remaining after destroying all the blocks has players spawn on [[sponge]]s which they can sometimes fall through and die.
* Due to a bug, players who are not the host can sometimes see phantom random blocks. They are mostly located on the edge of the island.
* The arena is located exactly in the middle of the world.
* Despite the initial casual nature of the mini-game, it has developed its own cyber-sport community.{{citation needed}}
