* System Events
** Added event {{cd|beforeWatchdogTerminate}}- Shuts down the server when a critical scripting exception occurs (e.g. script hang). Can be canceled to prevent shutdown
** Added enum {{cd|WatchdogTerminateReason}}- Specifies the reason for watchdog termination
** Added new properties to {{cd|properties}} for watchdog configuration on Bedrock Dedicated Server
*** {{cd|script-watchdog-enable-exception-handling}}- Enables watchdog exception handling via the {{cd|events.beforeWatchdogTerminate}} event (default = {{cd|true}})
*** {{cd|script-watchdog-enable-shutdown}}- Enables server shutdown in the case of an unhandled watchdog exception (default = {{cd|true}})
*** {{cd|script-watchdog-hang-exception}}- Throws a critical exception when a hang occurs (default = {{cd|true}})

'''General'''
* Removed the component {{cd|minecraft:unwalkable}}
* Renamed {{cd|minecraft:explosion_resistance}} to {{cd|minecraft:destructible_by_explosion}} and restructured the component to be either defined as a boolean or as an object
** Setting the component to true will give the block the default {{cd|explosion_resistance}} and setting it to false will make the block indestructible by explosion
** Setting the component as an object will let users define the resistance of the block to a base explosion
