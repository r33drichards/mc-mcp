'''25w42a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.11]], released on October 14, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w42a|id=a|October 14, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Environment attribute]]s'''
{{collapse|
content=
* Provides a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.
* Each Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: 
** For example, {{cd|minecraft:visual/sky_color}} controls the color of the sky, and {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates}} controls whether water can be placed at a given location.

* Sources
** Environment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):
*** Dimensions
*** Biomes
** The "effective" value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.
*** For example, in the following scenario:
**** The overworld dimension provides <code>sky_color = #00ff00</code> (green)
**** The plains biome provides <code>sky_color = #ff0000</code> (red)
*** When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red {{cd|sky_color}}, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.
** When an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:
*** Override the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld's {{cd|sky_color}} in the above scenario.
*** Apply a modifier to a previous value.

* Modifiers
** An environment attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. 
*** However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.
*** For example, in the following scenario:
**** The overworld dimension provides <code>water_fog_radius = 96.0</code>
**** The plains biome modifies {{cd|water_fog_radius}} with a multiply modifier of {{cd|0.85}}
*** When in the plains biome, the {{cd|water_fog_radius}} will be resolved to <math>96.0*0.85 = 81.6</math>, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to {{cd|96.0}}.
** The kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. 
*** The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. 
*** This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. 
**** If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.

* Interpolation
** Interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. 
** Is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied.
** Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.
** Biomes
*** {{cd|sky_color}} is one attribute that will transition smoothly based on position.
*** For example, in the following scenario:
**** The plains biome provides <code>sky_color = #ff0000</code> (red)
**** The desert biome provides <code>sky_color = #ffff00</code> (yellow)
*** In the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. 
*** Other attributes, such as {{cd|water_evaporates}}, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned - only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.
*** Smooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.

* Environment Attribute Map
** Dimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.
** This map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:
<code>"attributes": {
"minecraft:visual/fog_color": "#ffaa00",
"minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates": true
}</code>
* Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.
** The value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:
*** {{cd|modifier}}: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type.
**** Default: {{cd|override}}
*** {{cd|argument}}: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier).
**** How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier.
*** For example, the following definition describes multiplying {{cd|water_fog_radius}} by 85%:
<code>"attributes": {
"minecraft:visual/water_fog_radius": {
"modifier": "multiply",
"argument": 0.85
}
}</code>

* Common Data Types
** The following data types are reused in various parts of the Environment Attributes system.
** RGB Color
*** Format can be one of the following:
**** A hex color RGB string, in the form {{cd|#rrggbb}}
**** A float array with 3 components, between {{cd|0}} and {{cd|1}}, in the form {{cd|[r, g, b]}}
**** An integer in packed RGB form.
** ARGB Color
*** Format can be one of the following:
**** A hex color ARGB string, in the form {{cd|#aarrggbb}}
**** A float array with 4 components, between {{cd|0}} and {{cd|1}}, in the form {{cd|[a, r, g, b]}}
**** An integer in packed ARGB form.
** Particle Options
*** A full definition of a particle, including any type-specific properties (as in the /particle command).
**** For example:
<code>{
"type": "minecraft:block_crumble",
"block_state": {
"Name": "minecraft:dirt"
}
}</code>

* Common Modifiers
* Every Environment Attribute has a specific value type, which describes how values must be defined as well as what modifiers are available and how they are interpolated. 
** Some are very specific, while others are reused across many attributes.
** Modifiers on Boolean Values
*** Argument format: boolean
**** {{cd|override}}
**** {{cd|and}}
**** {{cd|nand}}
**** {{cd|or}}
**** {{cd|nor}}
**** {{cd|xor}}
**** {{cd|xnor}}
** Modifiers on Float Values
*** Argument format: float
**** {{cd|override}}
**** {{cd|add}}
**** {{cd|subtract}}
**** {{cd|multiply}}
**** {{cd|minimum}}
**** {{cd|maximum}}
** Modifiers on Color Values
*** Argument format: RGB color (except {{cd|alpha_blend}})
**** {{cd|override}}
**** {{cd|add}} - component-wise additive color blending
**** {{cd|subtract}} - component-wise subtractive color blending..
**** {{cd|multiply}} - component-wise multiplicative color blending.
**** {{cd|alpha_blend}} - traditional alpha blending that might be seen in image editing software.
***** Argument format: ARGB Color
***** When the argument alpha is {{cd|1}}, it will behave as an override with no blending.

* [[Lunge]] is no longer mutually exclusive with [[Mending]].

=== General ===
'''[[Biome]]s'''
* Underwater biome fog color and fog distance is now blended based on the player's position between biomes, similarly to regular biome fog and sky colors.
* Added new attributes field for biomes to specify Environment Attributes.
** Note: certain attributes, such as gameplay/fast_lava are not evaluated positionally and thus cannot be set on a Biome.
* Many subfields under effects have been migrated to Environment Attributes:
** Note: the form of these attributes may not be identical to the original fields.
** {{cd|fog_color}} -> {{cd|minecraft:visual/fog_color}}
** {{cd|water_fog_color}} -> {{cd|minecraft:visual/water_fog_color}}

** {{cd|respawn_anchor_works}} -> {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/respawn_anchor_works}}
** {{cd|cloud_height}} -> {{cd|minecraft:visual/cloud_height}}
** {{cd|piglin_safe}} -> {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/piglins_zombify}}

'''[[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]]'''
* Enable authentication from web browsers.
** Authenticate by passing the token in <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</code> header when opening the WebSocket connection.
*** Example: Sec<code>-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, <token></code>
** Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using <code>management-server-allowed-origins</code>. The default value is empty, meaning <code>Sec-Websocket-Protocol</code> authentication is effectively disabled.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|70.1}}.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Biome Tags
** Removed {{cd|#snow_golem_melts}} and {{cd|#increased_fire_burnout}} - replaced by {{cd|gameplay/snow_golem_melts}} and {{cd|gameplay/increased_fire_burnout}} Environment Attributes.

== Trivia ==
* This version has the same protocol version number as [[1.21.10 Release Candidate 1]]. The two versions are not actually compatible; 25w42a crashes when attempting to join a 1.21.10-rc1 world, and 1.21.10-rc1 throws a "Network Protocol Error" message when attempting to join a 25w42a world.
