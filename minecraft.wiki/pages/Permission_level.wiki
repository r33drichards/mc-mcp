'''Permission level''' is used to describe the permissions a player or a command executor has.

For example, {{in|bedrock}}, {{cmd|setmaxplayers}} can't be executed in a command block, because this command requires the executor to have a permission level of 3, while command blocks have a permission level of only 2.

== Description ==
Levels are incremental, meaning level ''n'' allows anything that any level less than ''n'' allows.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{IN|java}}, the permission levels may allow players to configure certain game settings:

'''Level 0 &ndash; All'''
* No permission.

'''Level 1 &ndash; Moderator'''
* The player can bypass [[spawn protection]].

'''Level 2 &ndash; Gamemaster'''
* More [[command]]s are available.
* The player can use [[command block]]s.
* The player can copy the server-side NBT data of an entity or a block entity when pressing the {{key|F3+I}} [[debug hotkey]], and copy the client-side NBT data when pressing {{key|shift+F3+I}}.
* The player can use {{key|F3+F4}} ([[game mode switcher]]) and {{key|F3+N}} debug hotkey (toggle between [[Spectator]] and the previous [[game mode]]).
* The player can change or lock [[difficulty]] in [[Options]] screen. Note that the player in a singleplayer world or the owner of a LAN world can change or lock difficulty without a permission level of 2.
* With "Operator Items Tab" [[option]] turned on, the player can find operator items and an "Operator Utilities" tab in the [[creative inventory]]. 
* [[Target selector]]s can be used in commands like {{cmd|tell}} and [[raw JSON text]]s.

'''Level 3 &ndash; Admin'''
* Commands related to multiplayer management are available.

'''Level 4 &ndash; Owner'''
* All commands are available, including commands related to server management.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, permission levels mostly dictate which commands a [[player]] may use. In different levels, certain commands are available, and a level inherits commands from levels less than it.

The permission levels and their available commands are:{{note|The first names and commands are from [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/commands/commands the official documentation]. The second names are from the debug information of [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]].}}

[[File:Ore UI - Pause Menu - Player Permissions Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|380px|thumb|The Player Permissions menu {{in|be}}.]]
<!-- Used for [[Tutorial:Menu_screen/Bedrock_Edition#Player_Permissions]] transclusion --> <section begin="player-permissions"/>
Player permissions dictate what the player can and cannot do in a multiplayer game. For example, actions such as building, [[mining]], attacking mobs or players can be disabled or restricted by each of their own permissions. They can be configured individually or by preset roles on a separate [[Tutorial:Menu_screen/Bedrock_Edition#Player_Permissions|screen]] accessible in the [[pause menu]].

There are four roles which can set specific permissions for players:
* '''Operator''', which enables all permissions, including operator commands, world settings, teleportation, and all of member permissions.
* '''Member''', which enables mining, building, world and entities interactions.
* '''Visitor''', which only lets players view or observe the world only, with none of the permissions enabled.
* '''Custom''', which enables specific permissions set by operators. Following permissions can be applied for custom role:

The owner of the world can change any player permissions, regardless of its own permissions. Other players can't change any player permissions unless if they are [[operator]]s, but they can still view them for themselves and other joined players.

Player permissions differ from [[permission level]], the latter enables and restricts specific commands, requiring different level for each command. Additionally, the "Operator Commands" permission if enabled sets the player's permission level to 3 in singleplayer or [[LAN]] world. In [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]], it sets the permission level to 1.<section end="player-permissions"/>

== Situations ==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
* For a function:
** When [[Function_(Java_Edition)#Loading and Parsing|parsing]] a [[Function_(Java_Edition)|function]] (including macro line parsing), the permission level defaults to 2 (but it can be changed in [[server.properties]]).
** When calling a [[Function_(Java_Edition)|function]], see [[command context]] for details.
* For a player:
** If the player is an operator in a dedicated server, their permission level can be specified in the [[ops.json format|ops.json]] file. and its default value is specified in [[server.properties]].
** If the player is the owner or another operator in a [[Realms|Realm]], their permission level is 2.
*** Unless the Realm is playing a ''minigame'': then the owner's permission level is 0, and no one else can be operators.<ref>https://atlas.minecraft.net/guidelines</ref>
** If the player is in a singleplayer world, and [[cheats]] were enabled when creating the world, their permission level is 4.
** If the player is the owner of a LAN world, and [[cheats]] were enabled when creating the world, their permission level is 4.
** All players in a [[Cheats|command-allowed]] LAN world have a permission level of 4.
** Otherwise, the player's permission level is 0.
* For other command executors, see [[command context]] for details.
* For raw JSON text resolution executors, see [[command context]] for details.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
* For a function:
** When [[Function_(Bedrock_Edition)#Loading and Parsing|parsing]] a [[Function (Bedrock_Edition)|function]], the permission level is 1.
** When calling a [[Function_(Bedrock_Edition)|function]], see [[command context]] for details.
* For a player:
** In a [[BDS|dedicated server]], if the player's '''"Operator Commands"''' option is enabled in the "Player Permission" screen, their permission level is 1.
** In a singleplayer world or a LAN world, if the player's '''"Operator Commands"''' option is enabled in the "Player Permission" screen, permission level is 3.
** Otherwise, the player's permission level is 0.
* For other command executors, see [[command context]] for details.
