A '''snow block''' is a full-sized [[block]] of [[snow]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
To obtain a snow block or [[snowball]]s, the block must be broken with a [[shovel]]; otherwise, the breaking time is greater, and the block drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Snow Block|Shovel|Wood|drop=0}}
A snow block drops four [[snowball]]s when broken by a tool without [[Silk Touch]].<br>
A snow block drops itself when broken by a tool with Silk Touch.

=== Natural generation ===
Snow blocks generate on the ground in the [[ice spikes]], [[grove]], [[snowy slopes]], [[frozen peaks]] and [[jagged peaks]] biomes, they form the walls of [[igloo]]s and some [[snowy plains]] [[village]] houses and can also generate on top of some [[iceberg]]s.

=== Snow ===
A snow block can also be obtained by breaking 8 snow layers with a Silk Touch shovel.<ref name="MC-134408">{{bug|MC-134408||Breaking 8-level snow layer with Silk Touch drops snow block}}</ref>

== Usage ==
=== Melting ===
Unlike [[snow]], snow blocks do not melt when a [[heat block]]{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}} or a light-emitting block is nearby, nor will they melt in dry biomes.

=== Snow golems ===
{{FakeImage|align=right|{{BlockGrid|s=Snow Block|p=Carved Pumpkin|p|s|s}}|Snow Golem build configuration}}

Snow blocks can be used to make [[snow golem]]s by putting 2 snow blocks on top of another and a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]] on the top as the head. Note that the carved pumpkin has to be placed last for this to work. This can be done sideways and upside-down, as well.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Snow may still fall on top of snow blocks, making them look taller than they actually are.
* When a snow block is on grass, the grass block changes to a different "snowy" texture as if a snow layer is on it. However, because snow blocks are not transparent to light, the grass changes to dirt shortly after.
