'''Turtles''' are [[passive mobs]] found in [[beach]] biomes. They can be bred with [[seagrass]] and lay [[turtle eggs]]. They are the only source of [[turtle scute]]s, which drop from baby turtles when they mature into adults.

== Spawning ==
Turtles occasionally spawn in small groups on the sand in [[beach]]es, but not in [[snowy beach]]es or [[stony shore]]s.

Turtles have a 5% chance to spawn as babies.

{{IN|Java}}, turtles spawn in groups of up to 5 individuals, y level less than 4 blocks above [[sea level]] (from y level -64 to 66, inclusive), and on blocks with the [[Block_tag_(Java_Edition)#sand|sand]] tag (sand, red sand, and suspicious sand).

{{IN|bedrock}}, turtles spawn in groups of 2–6, at Y=60–67.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== Breeding ===
Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.
=== On death ===
{{DropTable

|notes=
not-lightning = Only when not killed by [[lightning]].
lightning = Only when killed by [[lightning]].
}}
* {{xp|1|3}}, if killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

Baby turtles do not drop anything when they [[die]].

=== Growth ===
When a baby turtle matures into an adult, it drops 1 {{ItemLink|turtle scute}}.

== Behavior ==
Turtles can move around slowly on land and swim at a fast speed in [[water]]. Like other passive mobs, they move around aimlessly and flee when attacked. When on land, they generally attempt to move to the nearest water source that is at least 2 blocks deep, regardless if player made or natural. When in an enclosed area, such as a player-made enclosure, they generally swim in circles if the water is in the area, and rarely go on land to explore, if there is any.

Turtles cannot be attached to [[lead]]s,<ref>{{bug|MC-125629||Turtles can't be leashed|WAI}}</ref> but they can be led by a [[player]] holding [[seagrass]] within 10 blocks of the turtle.

Turtles can be picked up by [[boat]]s and [[minecart]]s.

Turtles are dealt 3.4×10<sup>38</sup> ({{healthbar|2|9px}} × 1.7×10<sup>38</sup>){{only|je|short=1}}/{{hp|10000}}{{only|be|short=1}} damage when struck by lightning.

As with other [[aquatic mobs]], turtles suffer extra damage when hit by a [[trident]] with the [[Impaling]] enchantment {{in|java}}, and cannot drown, despite the fact that real-life turtles breathe air.

=== Predators ===
Turtles and [[turtle egg]]s are attacked by the following mobs:

Zombies and their variants deliberately trample on turtle eggs, causing them to break. The range of detection is a 47×7×47‌[JE only] or 11×5×11‌[BE only] box centered on the block the mob is standing on.
<references group="note" />

=== Home position ===
A turtle remembers the block on which it spawned as its home position. No matter how far away the turtle is, it always attempts to return to its home position to lay its eggs after [[breeding]].

If the player uses a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]] to obtain and move [[turtle egg]]s to a new location before hatching, the baby turtles remember the new hatching location as their home beach.

If a turtle is spawned from a [[spawn egg]], summoned with the {{cmd|summon}} [[command]], or spawned by a [[monster spawner]], it remembers the spawn location as its home position.
[[File:A Turtle Digging Sand.png|thumb|A turtle digs sand around the block on which it lays its eggs.]]

=== Breeding ===
[[File:A Turtle Lays Eggs.png|thumb|A turtle lays eggs after digging.]]
Feeding two turtles [[seagrass]] results in them entering [[breeding|love mode]] and one of the turtles becoming pregnant. The pregnant turtle has eggs in its body and is therefore about 0.2 blocks taller than normal.

==== Egg laying ====
The turtle then travels back to its home position, which is where it first spawned. The turtle does not stop traveling until it is within a 9-block distance from its home position. Upon arrival, it seeks a nearby [[sand]] block on which to lay its eggs. Then, it spends a few seconds digging vigorously while turning 180 degrees a few times. Finally, it lays a cluster of 1–4 turtle eggs, as a single block. Turtles have a cooldown of {{Convert|90|seconds|game ticks}} after breeding {{in|Bedrock}}, or {{Convert|5|minutes|seconds|game ticks}} {{in|Java}}.

==== Egg hatching ====
{{main|Turtle Egg#Hatching}}

[[Turtle egg]]s can be placed on any block in clusters of up to 4; however, they only hatch on [[sand]], [[red sand]], or [[suspicious sand]], above or below water. Eggs can be broken without tools and can also be trampled by living entities falling or walking on them. When a cluster is trampled, the eggs crack and break one at a time. A turtle can walk on turtle eggs without breaking them.

Turtle eggs progress toward hatching by cracking. Cracking occurs during random ticks, and an egg hatches once it has cracked 3 times. When a cluster of eggs hatches, all eggs within the block hatch simultaneously. Eggs grow faster at night and typically take 4 to 5 in-game days to hatch. Mining a cluster of turtle eggs with [[Silk Touch]] causes it to drop one egg at a time, which the player can collect. Eggs do not preserve the cracking stage when harvested.

=== Babies ===
With a height of 0.12 blocks, baby turtles are among the smallest [[mob]]s in the game. Baby turtles are small enough that when they walk on [[soul sand]], they are entirely within the space at the top of the [[block]].

Upon hatching, baby turtles search for the nearest water block within a 47×1×47 region two blocks below the turtle and attempt to approach it.

Baby turtles take one Minecraft day to grow up (20 minutes). The growth can be accelerated using [[seagrass]]. Each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. Upon becoming an adult, the turtle drops a [[turtle scute]].

Stray cats attack baby turtles within 15 blocks; tamed cats do not.  The baby turtles make no attempt to flee from cats, even while being attacked.
