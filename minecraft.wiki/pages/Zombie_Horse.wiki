A '''zombie horse''' is an [[undead]] variant of the [[horse]]. It rarely spawns in dark areas as a [[hostile mob]] being ridden and controlled by a '''[[zombie]] horseman''' wielding an [[iron spear]]. It becomes [[passive]] once separated from the zombie rider.

== Spawning ==
=== Zombie horseman ===
Zombie horses can naturally spawn on [[grass block]]s in [[savanna]], [[savanna plateau]], [[windswept savanna]], [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], and [[snowy plains]] biomes as '''zombie horsemen''': a [[zombie]] wielding an [[iron spear]] riding a zombie horse. Like zombies themselves, zombie horsemen can only spawn at a light level of 0, both above ground and underground. However, due to the lack of [[grass block]]s underground in the [[Overworld]], they are mostly found on the surface. The zombie horse never spawns as a baby. Other zombie variants such as [[husk]]s and [[zombie villager]]s cannot spawn as horsemen. {{IN|bedrock}}, zombie horses are programmed to spawn in [[ice spikes]] biomes, but they fail to do so naturally, as the biome's surface is made of snow blocks instead of grass blocks, meaning they also cannot spawn underground in that biome.

Zombie horses count towards the "monster" [[mob cap]] and can despawn like most hostile mobs until the first time any player interacts with it. At that point it becomes persistent and no longer counts towards any mob cap either.

When using the zombie horse's [[spawn egg]], 20% of spawned zombie horses will be the otherwise unused baby variant.

Zombie horses do not spawn in Peaceful [[difficulty]], like hostile mobs.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Rotten Flesh|quantity=2-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a player or [[tamed wolf]].
If equipped with a saddle or horse armor, the saddle and/or horse armor will be dropped upon death.

Baby zombie horses yield neither items nor experience.

The zombie horse is an [[undead]] mob that spawns as a hostile mob with a [[zombie]] controlling it, as the rider controls its pathfinding, making the zombie horse target the player. On their own, zombie horses behave like normal horses, roaming idly and occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike [[sheep]] and like other horses, the eating animation does not cause any grass to be consumed.

Like other undead mobs, zombie horses can breathe in water.  Unlike [[skeleton horses]] and other undead, they do not sink - they float - in or on [[water]].

Zombie horses have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, zombie horses can be killed by the [[conduit]] like any regular hostile mob and prevent the player from sleeping.{{until|BE 26.0}}

Zombie horses can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Zombie horses also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}). If an entity is riding a zombie horse, they receive the same fall damage as the zombie horse.

Zombie horses cannot be [[bred]].

Unlike most passive mobs, zombie horses don't panic when damaged.{{upcoming|JE 26.1|BE 26.0}}

If a player pulling a zombie horse with a lead enters a [[boat]], the zombie horse follows by swimming the same speed as the boat. A player riding a zombie horse is dragged along if the zombie horse is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.

{{IN|Java}}, zombie horses are never spawned as part of a [[zombie siege]], but if a zombie horseman naturally spawns nearby, it will join the siege and behave like all other zombies.

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Like most other undead mobs, zombie horses burn in direct sunlight. They are protected from burning when wearing horse armor, similar to other undead mobs wearing [[helmet]]s. As horse armor has no [[durability]], it does not break from absorbing the damage like helmets do.

As they are [[monsters]], zombie horses count towards the hostile mob cap. [[Parrot]]s can also imitate them like other hostile mobs.

=== Taming ===
{{main|Horse#Taming}}
As with regular horses, zombie horses can be [[tamed]] by [[riding]] them until they stop bucking the player off.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult untamed zombie horse to form a [[jockey]].

=== Statistics ===
All zombie horses have three "equine stats": health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump height. While health is the same for all zombie horses, movement speed and jump height vary from horse to horse.

==== Health ====
Zombie horses are spawned with a constant health of {{hp|25|mob=1}}. The last half-heart is not shown in a zombie horse's health bar, which only displays {{hp|24|mob=1}}.

==== Movement speed ====
A zombie horse's movement speed is randomly assigned within certain ranges which vary between {{JE}} and {{BE}}. In ''Java Edition'', it ranges between ~0.21347 and ~0.28463 in internal units, with an average of ~0.24905. In ''Bedrock Edition'', it ranges between 0.205 and 0.275, with an average of 0.24. The conversion factor between internal units and blocks/sec is roughly 43.17.

* ''Java Edition'':
** Minimum: 9.216 blocks/s
** Average: 10.752 blocks/s
** Maximum: 12.288 blocks/s

* ''Bedrock Edition'':
** Minimum: 8.85 blocks/s
** Average: 10.361 blocks/s
** Maximum: 11.872 blocks/s

==== Jump strength ====
Zombie horses' jump strength ranges from 0.5 to 0.7, with an average of 0.6 in internal units.

The minimum jump strength of 0.5 is enough to clear 1.7088 blocks, while the maximum of 0.7 is enough to clear 3.124 blocks. The average jump strength of 0.6 is enough to clear 2.3675 blocks.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Transportation}}
Tamed and [[saddle]]d zombie horses can be used as a means of [[transportation]]. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences.

=== Healing ===
[[Red mushroom]]s can be {{ctrl|fed}} to a zombie horse to heal it by {{hp|3|mob=1}}. The zombie horse can also be tempted (or "led") with a red mushroom.

=== Equipment ===
[[File:Zombie Horse GUI.png|thumb|right|GUI of a zombie horse.]]

Tamed zombie horses have two equipment slots:
* {{SlotSprite|Saddle}} Saddle slot: For equipping a [[saddle]].
* {{SlotSprite|Horse Armor}} Armor slot: For equipping [[horse armor]].

Baby zombie horses cannot be equipped, as they cannot be ridden.

Equipment can be placed on a zombie horse by holding it and then {{control|using}} on the zombie horse, or by accessing its inventory. A zombie horse’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the horse and using {{control|inventory}} control, or by {{control|sneaking}} and then {{control|using}} or pressing the "open inventory" button{{only|bedrock}} on the zombie horse. The player cannot open the inventory on an untamed zombie horse, though they can open containers.

The equipment can be removed by two methods:
* Removing the equipment from their slots in the zombie horse's inventory.
* {{ctrl|Using}} [[shears]] on the zombie horse. If both a saddle and horse armor are equipped, they are removed one at a time. The first use removes the horse armor, and a second use removes the saddle.

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}

Once a zombie horse is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with directional controls, {{control|jump}}, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control. Like when riding other entities, it is possible for a player to use a [[nether portal]] or [[end portal]] while on a zombie horse.

A ridden zombie horse automatically runs up any one-block-high slope. The horse and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The zombie horse itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Like other horses, zombie horses cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

Ridden zombie horses have the ability of "jump charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on the [[HUD]] is replaced by a jump charging bar. The zombie horse is then able to {{control|jump}}, and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Zombie horses are not affected by the [[Jump Boost]] effect.
