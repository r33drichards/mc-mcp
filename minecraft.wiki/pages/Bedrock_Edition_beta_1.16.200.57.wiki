== Fixes ==
'''Performance and Stability '''
* Improved terrain building speed when flying with [[Elytra]]. ({{bug|MCPE-85614}}).
* Fixed a bug that would crash the game when using the [[crafting table]] on [[Creative]] mode.
* Fixed an issue with a runaway block ticking queue that occurred on a looping data-driven block that changed itself to a different permutation. The bug could cause memory issues, increase load and save times, as well as stalling the game periodically.

'''Technical Changes  '''
* Reduced content warning spam with data-driven block geometry.
* A fix for dedicated server that copies the experimental toggle state to LevelSettings while initializing the server instance to make sure it uses the values specified in the loading world.
* Fixed data-driven blocks to shrink UVs the same was as actors to prevent UV bleeding.</onlyinclude>
