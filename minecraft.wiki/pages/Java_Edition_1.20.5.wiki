{{Additions table
|Armadillo Scute
|Armadillo Spawn Egg Revision 1
|Wolf Armor
}}

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Armadillo Scute JE2 BE2.png|class=pixel-image|x32px]] [[Armadillo scute]]'''
* Dropped by [[armadillo]]s periodically and when [[brush]]ed.
* [[Dispenser]]s can be used to brush armadillo scutes off armadillos.
* Can be used to craft and repair [[wolf armor]].

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Armadillo Spawn Egg JE3 BE3.png|x32px]] [[Armadillo spawn egg]]

'''[[File:Wolf Armor JE3 BE3.png|class=pixel-image|x32px]] [[Wolf armor]]'''
[[File:All Dyes on Collars and Wolf Armor.png|thumb|[[Wolves]] wearing dyed [[wolf armor]] in all 16 basic colors]]
* Crafted with 6 [[armadillo scute]]s in a harness shape.
* Protects [[wolves]] from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks.
** Provides an armor value of {{armor|11}}.
* Shows signs of increased breakage as durability goes down.
* Using wolf armor on an adult tamed wolf equips the armor on the wolf, and using [[shears]] makes it drop the armor.
** When the wolf gets sheared, the player is granted the '''Shear Brilliance''' advancement. 
** Only a wolf's owner can put on / shear off wolf armor. That also excludes dispensers.
* The wolf's owner can repair the armor with [[armadillo scute]]s while it is equipped on the [[wolf]].
* If a wolf dies while wearing armor, it drops the armor.
* Wolf armor can be dyed similarly to [[leather armor]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Armadillo JE2 BE2.png|x32px]] [[Armadillo]]'''
* The winner of [[Minecraft Live 2023]]'s Mob Vote.
* A passive mob that spawns in [[savanna]] and [[badlands]] biomes with the same frequency as [[chicken]]s and [[pig]]s.
* Has {{hp|12}} health points.
* Can drop [[armadillo scute]]s either periodically or when [[brush]]ed, but drops no loot when killed.
** Armadillos drop scutes at around the same rate as [[chicken]]s lay eggs.
** Brushing takes 16 durability from the [[brush]].
* Can be bred with [[spider eye]]s.
* If an armadillo detects a threat, it rolls up.
** Threats include:
*** A player [[sprinting]].
*** A player in a vehicle or mounted.
*** Anyone who has been attacked by someone recently.
*** [[Undead]] mobs.
** Special cases where an armadillo doesn't roll up include when it is:
*** Fleeing.
*** In water or in the air.
*** On a lead.
** When an armadillo is rolled up it cannot walk nor eat, and is not tempted by food. Additionally, it is protected by its shell, causing it to take reduced damage and completely negating damage from weaker attacks.
** While rolled up, armadillo continuously scans for threats. If no threats are detected for 3 seconds (60 ticks), it unrolls. Armadillos peek out to see if “the coast is clear” before unrolling.

[[File:Wolf variants.png|right|thumb|The nine variations of wolves.]]
'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Added 8 new wolf variants. There are now 9 wolf variants, including the original pale wolf.<ref>{{Mcnet|new-minecraft-wolves|New Minecraft Wolves|March 5, 2024|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
** {{EntitySprite|wolf}} The pale wolf spawns in the [[taiga]] biome.
** {{EntitySprite|rusty wolf}} The rusty wolf spawns in the [[sparse jungle]].
** {{EntitySprite|spotted wolf}} The spotted wolf spawns in the [[savanna plateau]].
** {{EntitySprite|black wolf}} The black wolf spawns in the [[old growth pine taiga]].
** {{EntitySprite|striped wolf}} The striped wolf spawns in the [[wooded badlands]].
** {{EntitySprite|snowy wolf}} The snowy wolf spawns in the [[grove]].
** {{EntitySprite|ashen wolf}} The ashen wolf spawns in the [[snowy taiga]].
** {{EntitySprite|woods wolf}} The woods wolf spawns in the [[forest]].
** {{EntitySprite|chestnut wolf}} The chestnut wolf spawns in the [[old growth spruce taiga]].
** Wolves spawned with the [[wolf spawn egg]] spawn as the variant associated with the biome the egg is used in. They default to pale wolf in any other biome.
** All wolves spawned before 1.20.5 are pale wolves and continue to be pale wolves.
* The new variants combined with the ability to dye a wolf's [[Wolf Armor|armor]] and [[Dye#Dyeing_collars|collar]], there are effectively 2,415,919,248 (2.4 billion) ''distinct'' wolves, which is 2,415,919,232 more than the 16 wolves that used to be available. Therefore, this update added 2,415,919,232 ''distinct'' wolves. See {{Slink|Wolf|Trivia}} for more details.

'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* Three new enchantments have been introduced, though only obtainable via commands.<ref name="noexp">{{bug|MC-270954|||Won't Fix}}</ref>

* [[Breach]]
** Rare enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
** Has 4 levels.
** Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target.
*** The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level.

* [[Density]]
** Common enchantment, accessible in the enchanting table and on enchanted books in loot.
** Has 5 levels.
** Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level.
*** Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 1 per level of Density.

* [[Wind Burst]]
** Unique enchantment which can only be found in [[ominous vault]]s.
** Has 3 levels.
** Maces enchanted with Wind Burst emit a burst of wind upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other.
** Each level bounces the attacker higher up in the air; however any level above the default maximum of 3 obtained through commands makes the player simply lose all downward momentum and begin falling again, without gaining any upward momentum.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Added <code>generic.fall_damage_multiplier</code> attribute to multiply overall fall damage amount.
** Default is 1, and the valid range is from 0 to 100.
* Added <code>generic.gravity</code> attribute that controls blocks/tick^2 acceleration downward.
** Default is 0.08, and the valid range is from -1 to +1.
* Added <code>generic.safe_fall_distance</code> attribute to control the fall distance after which the entity takes fall damage.
** Default is 3, and the valid range is from -1024 to +1024.
* Added the <code>generic.scale</code> attribute.
** Allows changing the size of any mob to anywhere between 0.0625 and 16 times their default size.
* Added the <code>generic.step_height</code> attribute.
** Determines the max height in blocks where a mob can walk above without jumping.
** Default is 0.6, and the valid range is from 0 to 10.
* Added <code>player.block_break_speed</code> attribute that acts as a multiplier over block breaking speed for players.
** The valid range is from 0 to 1024.
* Added the <code>player.block_interaction_range</code> and <code>player.entity_interaction_range</code> attributes.
** Determines the maximum range a player can interact with blocks and entities, respectively.
** They both range between 0 and 64, with the default value being 4.5 for blocks and 3 for entities.

'''Entity [[predicate]]'''
* Added entity sub-predicate <code>slots</code>, used to check single or multiple slots on any entity.
** For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass
** The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in <code>item</code> commands) to item predicate
** Example:
:: <syntaxhighlight lang="json">{
    "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
    "entity": "this",
    "predicate": {
        "slots": {
            "container.*": {
                "items": "dirt"
            }
        }
    }
}</syntaxhighlight>
* Added <code>raider</code> sub entity predicate.
** New sub-predicate has been added to match raidersFields:
*** <code>has_raid</code> - Match whether the raider is in an active raid.
*** <code>is_captain</code> - Match whether the raider is a captain.

'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added <code>spawnChunkRadius</code> to set the size of the spawn chunks.
** Defaults to <code>2</code>, equivalent to 3×3 entity ticking chunks.
** Possible values are <code>0</code> to <code>32</code>, where <code>0</code> completely disables the spawn chunks and <code>10</code> is equivalent to the functionality before this change.

'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Added new slot names:
** <code>container.*</code>: contains <code>container.0</code> to <code>container.53</code>.
** <code>hotbar.*</code>: contains <code>hotbar.0</code> to <code>hotbar.8</code>.
** <code>inventory.*</code>: contains <code>inventory.0</code> to <code>inventory.26</code>.
** <code>enderchest.*</code>: contains <code>enderchest.0</code> to <code>enderchest.26</code>.
** <code>villager.*</code>: contains <code>villager.0</code> to <code>villager.7</code>.
** <code>horse.*</code>: contains <code>horse.0</code> to <code>horse.14</code>.
** <code>weapon.*</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|weapon.mainhand|weapon.offhand}}.
** <code>armor.*</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|armor.head|armor.chest|armor.legs|armor.feet|armor.body}}.
** <code>player.cursor</code>: item held by player on screen except [[Creative mode]]<ref>{{bug|MC-269127||player.cursor slot name is available in creative mode|WAI}}</ref>.
** {{cd|d=and|player.crafting.0|player.crafting.1|player.crafting.2|player.crafting.3|player.crafting.*}}: player's crafting slots

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added <code>gameplay/panda_sneeze</code> loot table for drops when [[panda]]s sneeze.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Menu Background Blurriness" in accessibility settings.
** Defaults to 50%.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Added the following particle types: {{cd|d=and|infested|item_cobweb|small_gust|raid_omen|trial_omen|trial_spawner_detection_ominous|ominous_spawning|vault_connection}}.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Added transfer packets.
** Custom servers can now request that clients connect to another server with a new packet.
** When a client is transferred, it connects to the target server with a new transfer intent (id 3).
** By default, servers do not accept incoming transfers and disconnect the client.
*** This can be changed by setting the {{cd|accepts-transfers}} property to {{cd|true}} in the {{cd|server.properties}} file.
** Resource packs are maintained across transfers.
** In the case of a transfer, custom servers can skip authentication with a new flag.
* Added cookie packets.
** Cookie packets allow custom servers to request and store data on a client.
*** Each cookie may be up to 5 KiB in size.
*** Cookies may be requested during login, configuration and play phases — but only stored during the configuration and play phases.
** Cookies are persisted across server transfers but are not persisted when the player disconnects.
*** This allows servers to pass along information such as authentication or custom game data to the new server.
* Added an option to configure how region file compression algorithm is handled on dedicated servers.
** Added a dedicated server configuration property {{cd|region-file-compression}} with 3 possible values:
*** {{cd|deflate}}, the default option. Uses {{wikipedia|Deflate|the old algorithm}}.
*** {{cd|lz4}} uses {{wikipedia|LZ4 (compression algorithm)|LZ4 algorithm}}, which requires less CPU time to compress and decompress but uses more disk space.
*** {{cd|none}} does not compress the data.
**** Consumes significantly more space and requires significant time to read and write, even though CPU is used less.
**** Might make sense together with filesystem level compression.
** Changing the compression algorithm does not automatically recompress the world.
*** New or updated chunks use the newly configured algorithm, but the old ones stay in the previous format.
* Added a reserved region file compression id for third-party servers to use for custom compression implementations.
** Compression id {{cd|127}} can now be used for custom implementations of region file compression.
** When used, the version id must be followed by a namespaced string representing the custom algorithm used.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the following block tags:
** {{cd|#armadillo_spawnable_on}}: contains {{cd|d=and|#animals_spawnable_on|#badlands_terracotta|red_sand|coarse_dirt}}
*** Controls which blocks the [[armadillo]] can spawn on.
** {{cd|#badlands_terracotta}}: contains {{cd|d=and|terracotta|white_terracotta|yellow_terracotta|orange_terracotta|red_terracotta|brown_terracotta| light_gray_terracotta}}
** {{cd|#does_not_block_hoppers}}: contains {{cd|d=and|beehive|bee_nest}}
*** Controls which blocks never disable a hopper when placed above one.
** {{cd|#incorrect_for_wooden_tool}}, {{cd|#incorrect_for_gold_tool}}, {{cd|#incorrect_for_stone_tool}}, {{cd|#incorrect_for_iron_tool}}, {{cd|#incorrect_for_diamond_tool}}, and {{cd|#incorrect_for_netherite_tool}}
*** These tags combine the existing {{cd|#needs_diamond_tool}}, {{cd|#needs_iron_tool}}, and {{cd|#needs_stone_tool}} tags for each specific tool tier.
* Added the following damage type tag:
** {{cd|#bypasses_wolf_armor}}: contains {{cd|d=and|#bypasses_invulnerability|cramming|drown|dry_out|freeze|in_wall|indirect_magic|magic|outside_border|starve|thorns|wither}}
*** Controls which damage types bypass [[wolf armor]].
** {{cd|#is_player_attack}}: contains {{cd|player_attack}}

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cobweb]]'''
* Added unique sounds.

'''[[Grindstone]]'''
* No longer accepts items that have {{nbt|compound|unbreakable}} component but do not have an enchantment.
** If the item above has [[durability]], it can be repaired with an unbreakable item and the output does not inherit {{nbt|compound|unbreakable}} component. If the order is swapped, the item is neither be repaired nor disenchanted. If the only item in slots is an enchanted unbreakable item, it is disenchanted and {{nbt|compound|unbreakable}} component remains.
* No longer disenchants two [[enchanted book]]s at the same time.

'''[[Hopper]]'''
* Improved hopper performance.
* Hoppers no longer try to pick up item entities if there is a full block placed above it.
** Can, however, still pick up items from [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-268451||Hoppers can't pull honey bottles from bee hives or bee nests|Fixed}}</ref>

'''[[Player head]]'''
* Now stores item name in <code>custom_name</code> tag.
* NBT tag {{cd|SkullOwner}} and {{cd|ExtraType}} is replaced with <code>profile</code> to keep a consistent format with the item component form.

=== Items ===
'''General'''
* Now <code>count</code> is stored again when there is only 1 item.
** Defaults to 1 if this field is invalid.

'''[[Turtle scute]]'''
* Renamed "Scute" to "Turtle Scute".
* The ID has been changed from {{cd|scute}} to {{cd|turtle_scute}}.

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* <code>FactorCalculationData</code> has been removed from mob effect instance tags.
* Mobs with <code>CanPickUpLoot</code> no longer pick up enchanted items after picking up an unenchanted item.<ref>{{bug|MC-273522}}</ref>

'''[[Bee]]s and [[parrot]]s'''
* Adjusted their flying behavior to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down.

'''[[Cave spider]]s and [[spider]]s'''
* Are now scared of armadillos that are not in a rolled up state.

'''[[Horse]]'''
* Replaced {{Nbt|compound|ArmorItem}} with {{Nbt|compound|body_armor_item}}.

'''[[Llama]]'''
* Replaced {{Nbt|compound|DecorItem}} with {{Nbt|compound|body_armor_item}}.

'''[[Shulker]]s'''
* Are no longer able to destroy armor stands.

'''[[Shulker bullet]]s'''
* Are now easier to hit with melee player attacks, as their hitbox is now larger specifically when being melee-attacked by a player.

'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Changes to tamed wolves:
** Now have {{Hp|40}} instead of {{Hp|20}}.
** No longer take half damage from most environmental sources like they used to do.
** Feeding a wolf now heals twice as many health points.
** Now only take knockback from [[snowball]]s from [[snow golem]]s, like other mobs, instead of taking damage.
* Now have tag {{nbt|compound|body_armor_item}} to store the armor they are wearing.
* The texture of the wolf collar layer has been changed.
* Now spawns on [[coarse dirt]] and [[podzol]] blocks.
* Now spawns in [[sparse jungle]], [[savanna plateau]], and [[wooded badlands]] biomes.
* When summoned using [[spawn egg]]s or [[commands]], the variant selection now follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:
** Rusty wolf is selected in all [[jungle]] biomes, including jungle and bamboo jungle.
** Spotted wolf is selected in all [[savanna]] biomes, including savanna and windswept savanna.
** Striped wolf is selected in all [[badlands]] biomes, including badlands and eroded badlands.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Llama spit]]s'''
* Now use a new damage type <code>spit</code> instead of <code>mob_projectile</code>.
* Are no longer able to destroy armor stands.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Grove]]'''
* [[Rabbit]]s, [[wolves]], and [[fox]]es are now the only animals spawning in the grove biome.

=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Unstructured [[NBT data]] attached to stacks of items (<code>tag</code> field) has been replaced with structured 'components'.
** This data is parsed and validated when the item is loaded.
** This should improve performance in certain scenarios (e.g. armor trim rendering) when item data was frequently compared or requested and parsed.
** Custom data can still be stored in the {{cd|minecraft:custom_data}} component.
** This change has been made in order to:
*** Improve performance in cases where the game needs to frequently look up some property of an item (e.g. armor trims rendering every frame).
*** Validate item properties at load time, enabling easier identification of invalid data in commands and data packs.
**** This should avoid any 'silent' breakages in commands specifying custom item data for any potential future format changes.
*** Continue to evolve the game to enable the creation of dynamic content.
* Item types (e.g. {{cd|minecraft:stick}}) hold a set of default components on an item that individual item stacks can override.
* Commands such as <code>/give</code>, <code>/item</code>, <code>/loot</code>, and <code>/clear</code> have updated item syntax.
* Components can now be specified after the item name in square brackets.
** Components are assigned with an = (e.g. <code>wooden_pickaxe[damage=23]</code>).
** Components are comma-separated (e.g. <code>netherite_hoe[damage=5,repair_cost=2]</code>).
* Component types are autocompleted, but values themselves are not.
* Values however are validated, and the command fails to parse if the component is improperly specified. 
** e.g. <code>/give @s wooden_pickaxe[damage=-34]</code> is not valid.
* The pre-existing NBT syntax (<code>{...}</code>) must now be specified with the <code>minecraft:custom_data</code> component.
** e.g. <code>/give @s stick{foo:'bar'}</code> is equivalent to <code>/give @s stick[custom_data={foo:'bar'}]</code>.
* Item predicate arguments (in <code>/clear</code>) have new semantics with respect to matching components and custom data.
** Each specified component must be present on the target item, and have an exactly equal parsed value.
** Components with default values (e.g. <code>damage=0</code> by default) automatically exist on the target item if not specified.
*** As such, <code>/clear @s diamond_pickaxe[damage=0]</code> matches only undamaged diamond pickaxes.
*** On the other hand, <code>/clear @s diamond_pickaxe</code> matches any diamond pickaxe, irrespective of damage.
** Exact matching of component values applies even for the <code>minecraft:custom_data</code> component.
** However, the <code>{...}</code> syntax for custom data still uses the pre-existing partial matching behavior for NBT.
*** This means that all tags specified in the predicate must be present on the target item, but additional tags on the target item are ignored.
*** Lists in the target must contain all list-items specified in the predicate, but additional list-items are ignored.
* The format of serialized items and items in data packs has been updated for consistency and to support components.
* When advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the number of components is displayed instead of number of tags.
* Default component values for items are now listed in {{cd|items.json}} generated in {{cd|reports}} directory.
* Block definitions are now added to {{cd|blocks.json}} report (note: those definitions are not used yet and present only for informational purposes).
* The {{cd|ignoreTags}} field on villager trades has been removed and replaced by a component predicate on damage.
* If the {{cd|key_item}} field of a vault block is not present, the vault cannot be unlocked.
* Command arguments that previously accepted namespaced ids of loot tables, modifiers and predicates can now also accept inline definitions
** <code>loot</code>
** <code>item</code>
** <code>execute if predicate</code>
** Values have same structure as matching JSON files, though they are encoded as SNBT. Example: <code>execute if predicate {condition:weather_check, raining:true}</code>

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* Added {{Nbt|compound|body_armor_item}} to [[Entity format|entity data]], which functions similarly to entries of {{Nbt|list|HandItems}} and {{Nbt|list|ArmorItems}}.
** Also added {{Nbt|float|body_armor_drop_chance}}, which determines the chance of dropping body armor.
* Potion effects stored in items or entities no longer encode their default values.
** {{cd|amplifier}}: {{cd|0}}
** {{cd|duration}}: {{cd|0}}
** {{cd|ambient}}: {{cd|false}}
** {{cd|show_particles}}: {{cd|true}}
* All block positions are now stored as an array of 3 integers instead of a map of XYZ.
* {{Code|FlowerPos}} and {{Code|HivePos}} in bees have been renamed to {{Code|flower_pos}} and {{Code|hive_pos}}.
* {{Code|FlowerPos}} in beehives has been renamed to {{Code|flower_pos}}.
* {{Code|BeamTarget}} in end crystals has been renamed to {{Code|beam_target}}.
* {{Code|Leash}} in all leashable entities has been renamed to {{Code|leash}}.
* {{Code|PatrolTarget}} in patrolling mobs has been renamed to {{Code|patrol_target}}.
* {{Code|ExitPortal}} in end gateways has been renamed to {{Code|exit_portal}}.
* {{Code|WanderTarget}} in wandering traders has been renamed to {{Code|wander_target}}.
* Tipped arrows no longer store their applied potion effects.
** This is instead fetched from their held <code>item</code>.
* Area effect clouds now store potions in the same format as the <code>minecraft:potion_contents</code> component in a <code>potion_contents</code> field:
** <code>Potion</code> -> <code>potion_contents.potion</code>
** <code>Color</code> -> <code>potion_contents.custom_color</code>
** <code>effects</code> -> <code>potion_contents.custom_effects</code>
* Villager trades can be configured to accept only undamaged items by selecting for <code>'minecraft:damage': 0</code>
** By default, if no components are specified, any item is accepted (similar to <code>components</code> field in item predicates).

'''Item stack format'''
* Along with format changes due to components, the structures of item stacks on disk and in data packs have been updated for consistency.
* Previous <code>id</code> (string) and <code>Count</code> (byte) fields have been replaced with <code>id</code> (namespaced string) and <code>count</code> (integer) fields.
** This format is additionally applied to the <code>icon</code> field in advancements, items in chat component hover events, and the <code>result</code> field in smelting recipes (<code>result</code> and <code>count</code> are no longer inlined).
* The <code>count</code> field is optional (defaults to <code>1</code>), and no longer stored if default. 
** Stack size is now limited to the maximum stack size of the item.
* The <code>tag</code> field has been removed, and any remaining contents end up in the <code>minecraft:custom_data</code> component when upgrading.
* A new <code>components</code> field stores all components attached to an item.
** Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id).
*** e.g. <code><nowiki>{..., components: {'minecraft:damage': 12}}</nowiki></code>.
*** Components with a <code>!</code> prefix (e.g. <code>"!minecraft:damage": {}</code>) cause this component to be removed.
** Components equal to their default value are not stored.
* The item stack format no longer represents empty stacks (<code>air</code> item, or <code>count</code> 0).
** Instead, in places that support it, the field should be omitted.
** In some cases, such as lists of stacks (e.g. <code>HandItems</code> in living entities), an empty map (<code>{}</code>) is used to represent empty stacks.

'''[[Predicate]] format'''
* Item predicate format has been updated:
** <code>tag</code> field has been removed.
** <code>items</code> field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed item tag, or list of items.
** <code>potion</code> -> <code>potions</code>, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed potion tag, or list of potions.
** <code>nbt</code> predicate has been renamed to <code>custom_data</code> and now matches <code>minecraft:custom_data</code> component.
** A new optional <code>components</code> field matches exact components. 
*** All specified components must be present an exactly equal on the target item, but additional components may be ignored.
*** Components with defaults are assumed to exist on the target item if not specified.
*** Format: map of component id to component value (varies by component id).
**** e.g. <code>"components": { "minecraft:damage": 0 }</code> matches only undamaged items.
* Block predicate format has been updated:
** <code>tag</code> field has been removed.
** <code>blocks</code> field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed block tag, or list of blocks.
* Fluid predicate format has been updated:
** <code>tag</code> field has been removed.
** <code>fluid</code> -> <code>fluids</code>, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed fluid tag, or list of fluids.
* Entity predicate format has been updated:
** <code>type</code> field now supports a single entry, hash-prefixed entity type tag, or list of entity types.
* Location predicate format has been updated:
** <code>biome</code> -> <code>biomes</code>, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed biome tag, or list of biomes.
** <code>structure</code> -> <code>structures</code>, and supports a single entry, hash-prefixed structure tag, or list of structures.

'''Other format changes'''
* Banners now store applied patterns in the same format as the <code>minecraft:banner_patterns</code> component in a <code>patterns</code> field:
** <code>Patterns[].Pattern</code> (string short id) -> <code>patterns[].pattern</code> (string pattern registry id)
** <code>Patterns[].Color</code> (integer dye id) -> <code>patterns[].color</code> (string dye name)
* Beehive format has also been updated:
** <code>Bees[].EntityData</code> -> <code>bees[].entity_data</code>
** <code>Bees[].TicksInHive</code> -> <code>bees[].ticks_in_hive</code>
** <code>Bees[].MinOccupationTicks</code> -> <code>bees[].min_ticks_in_hive</code>
** <code>FlowerPos</code> -> <code>flower_pos</code>

'''{{cmd|attribute}}'''
* Modifier operations have been renamed:
** <code>add</code> -> <code>add_value</code>
** <code>multiply_base</code> -> <code>add_multiplied_base</code>
** <code>multiply</code> -> <code>add_multiplied_total</code>

'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* <code>if</code> and <code>unless</code> sub-commands can now use <code>items</code> to compare or count items.
** <code><nowiki>execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate></nowiki></code>
*** <code><nowiki><source></nowiki></code> is the same one as used in {{cmd|item}}.
**** e.g. <code>block <x> <y> <z></code> or <code>entity <target></code> (selector can return multiple entities)
*** <code><slots></code> can accept single slot (like <code>container.0</code>) or a range (like <code>container.*</code>)
*** <code><item_predicate></code> is the same as item predicate in {{cmd|clear}} command.
* If used alone, it returns total number of items in stacks that match predicates.

'''{{cmd|item}}'''
* <code>slot</code> now supports a range of slots.

'''{{cmd|playsound}}'''
* Can now be used without specifying the player (assuming {{cd|@s}}) and without specifying the mixer (assuming {{cd|master}}).

'''[[Item modifier]]s'''
* <code>minecraft:set_nbt</code> and <code>minecraft:copy_nbt</code> functions have been renamed to <code>minecraft:set_custom_data</code> and <code>minecraft:copy_custom_data</code> respectively.
** These now apply to the <code>minecraft:custom_data</code> component of the target item.
* <code>minecraft:set_attributes</code> function has been updated.
** The modifier <code>slot</code> field now supports <code>any</code>, <code>armor</code>, and <code>hand</code> values.
** The modifier <code>operation</code> values have been renamed: 
*** <code>addition</code> -> <code>add_value</code>
*** <code>multiply_base</code> -> <code>add_multiplied_base</code>
*** <code>multiply_total</code> -> <code>add_multiplied_total</code>
** Added <code>replace</code> field (default: true).
*** When false, attributes are appended.
* Nested lists are no longer supported in function lists.
* Changed <code>set_contents</code> loot function.
** Unused field <code>type</code> has been removed.
** Added new mandatory field <code>component</code>:
*** Describes target component to be filled with items.
*** Existing contents are replaced.
*** Allowed values: <code>container</code>, <code>bundle_contents</code>, <code>charged_projectiles</code>
*** <code>bundle_contents</code> and <code>charged_projectiles</code> ignore empty stacks.
* Changed <code>set_custom_data</code> loot function.
** Field <code>tag</code> now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags.
* Changed <code>set_lore</code> loot function.
** The <code>replace</code> field has been removed.
** Now has <code>mode</code> like <code>set_fireworks</code> and <code>set_written_book_pages</code>.

* Changed <code>set_name</code> loot function.
** Added optional field <code>target</code> to specify which name should be set
** Values:
*** <code>custom_name</code> - sets <code>custom_name</code> component (default)
*** <code>item_name</code> - sets <code>item_name</code> component

'''Item predicate argument'''
* The item predicate syntax (used in <code>execute if|unless items</code> and <code>clear</code> commands) has been significantly expanded.
* The general syntax is: <code><type> [comma-separated list of <test>]</code>
* <code><type></code> can be one of:
** item id
** item tag id prefixed with <code>#</code>
** <code>*</code> to match any item
* <code><test></code> can have one of 3 forms:
** <code><component_id>=<value></code> - match exact value of component (same as in previous format)
*** <code><value></code> is a representation of component value in SNBT format (same as in <code>item give</code> argument)
** <code><component_id></code> - check if component exists
** <code><predicate_id>~<value></code> - check item sub-predicate
*** <code><value></code> is a representation of item sub-predicate in SNBT format (but otherwise same as one used for advancement and loot table JSON files)
*** Example: <code>*[damage~{durability:{min:3}}]</code> matches any stack with at least 3 uses left
* The special name <code>minecraft:count</code> can be used for matching the stack size
** <code>count=<positive int></code> passes only when the stack size equals the given value
** <code>count~<int range></code> passes when the stack size is in the specified range
*** Example: <code>*[count~{max:2}]</code> matches any stack with count <= 2
** <code>count</code> always passes
* Any <code><test></code> entry can be negated by prefixing with <code>!</code>
** Example: <code>*[!count=1]</code> matches any stack that has count other than 1
* <code><test></code> elements can be also joined with | to check multiple alternatives
** Example: <code>*[!damage|damage=0]</code> looks for items without damage component or with 0 damage
* Removed redundant custom data section (<code>{...}</code>) from item arguments (it's fully replaced by <code>[custom_data={...}]</code>)
** To make this transition easier, <code>custom_data</code> item sub-predicate has been changed to allow unquoted SNBT
* The syntax for custom data partial matching (<code>{}</code>) has been removed in favor of using <code>custom_data</code> predicates
** So <code>stick{a:2}</code> becomes <code>stick[custom_data~{a:2}]</code>

'''Item sub-predicates'''
* General rules of component predicates:
** Unless otherwise specified, a field in predicate with the same name as a field in component that matches (i.e. has the same name as predicate) will match that field value
** Those fields usually have the same type as in the components, but are optional.
** Exceptions:
*** List fields are replaced with collection matchers (see below)
*** Integer and float fields are replaced with ranges
*** Registry ids are replaced with a type that accepts id, list of ids or a tag
* Collection matcher is a shared part of predicate used for matching collections. Every instance of this matcher has same fields with same functionality, with only difference being type of matched elementFields:
** <code>size</code> - integer range to match against collection size
** <code>contains</code> - a list of element predicates
*** All conditions must match for predicate to pass
*** Not all elements in tested container have to be matched
*** Elements can be in any order
*** Single element can match multiple predicates
*** Examples (when matching item stacks):
**** <code>{contents:[{item:diamond}]}</code> - matches when there is at least one diamond item
**** <code>{contents:[{item:diamond}, {item:dirt}]}</code> - matches when there is at least one diamond item and at least one dirt item
** <code>count</code> - a list of matchers on element counts
*** Entry fields:
**** <code>test</code> - element matcher
**** <code>count</code> - optional integer range to check against number of elements passing <code>test</code>
*** Examples (when matching item stacks):
**** <code>{count:[{count:3,test:{items:diamond}}]}}</code> matches only when there are exactly 3 stacks of diamonds (no matter the stack size)

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Removed {{cd|any}} entity sub-predicate.
* Added slot name {{cd|contents}} for single-slot entities like [[item frame]]s and [[item display]]s.
* Contents of {{cd|item}} entity can now be accessed through {{cd|contents}} slot name.
* Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field {{cd|predicates}}.
** Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field {{cd|predicates}}.
** The new field is similar to the <code>components</code> field on item stacks.
** This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match.
** The following fields have been moved:
*** <code>enchantments</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:enchantments</code>
*** <code>stored_enchantments</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:stored_enchantments</code>
*** <code>potions</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:potion_contents</code>
*** <code>custom_data</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:custom_data</code>
**** Predicate <code>minecraft:custom_data</code> now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags
***** That means that <code>*[custom_data~{a:1}]</code> and <code>*[custom_data~"{a:1}"]</code> are equivalent
***** Flattened string format has been kept since NBT type information can't be expressed in JSON
* <code>durability</code> field has been expanded to <code>minecraft:damage</code> predicate:
** This check now works for any item that has <code>minecraft:damage</code> component
** An item that does not have a <code>minecraft:damage</code> component can never match
** To check for unbreakable items, query value of <code>minecraft:unbreakable</code> component
** Fields:
*** <code>damage</code> - optional bounds for value of <code>minecraft:damage</code> component
*** <code>durability</code> - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of <code>minecraft:damage</code>)
* Predicates <code>minecraft:enchantments</code>, <code>minecraft:stored_enchantments</code>, <code>minecraft:potion_contents</code> and <code>minecraft:damage</code> require matching component to exist on item
** That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list does not pass on items without <code>minecraft:damage</code> component
** Note: some components, like <code>minecraft:enchantments</code> have default values, so they always match.
** <code>wolf</code>
*** New <code>wolf</code> sub-predicate has been added to match wolf variantsFields: <code>variant</code> - wolf variant to match (single entry, list of entries or tag)
** <code>cat</code>, <code>frog</code>, <code>painting</code>
*** Field <code>variant</code> now accepts single entries, list of entries or tags.
** <code>wolf</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>frog</code> and <code>painting</code> entity sub-predicates now accept tags and plain lists instead of just single elements.

'''[[Slot]]s'''
* Replaced <code>horse.armor</code> [[slot]] argument with <code>armor.body</code>, applicable now to all mobs.

'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* The projectile weapon enchantments [[Infinity]], [[Flame]], [[Multishot]], [[Piercing]], [[Power]], and [[Punch]] now work on both crossbows and bows, if placed onto the alternative weapon using data manipulation or a change to the <code>enchantable/*</code> tags.


'''[[End portal]]'''
* When entities leave or enter [[the End]], the area they arrive in now stays loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of [[nether portal]]s.

'''[[Spawn chunk]]s'''
* The size of the spawn chunks changed from radius 10 (19x19 entity ticking chunks) to radius 2 (3×3 entity ticking chunks).
** This was done to reduce memory usage, loading times and CPU usage.
** The developers opted to not fully remove spawn chunks to allow players who currently utilize this functionality to continue to do so.

=== General ===
'''General'''
* The game now requires a 64-bit operating system.
* The game now requires Java 21.
* The included Java distribution is now the Microsoft build of OpenJDK 21.0.2.

'''Accessibility'''
* The default focus is now always set when entering or exiting any menu while navigating using tab or arrow keys.

'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Renamed <code>horse.jump_strength</code> to <code>generic.jump_strength</code>, and now applies to all entities.
** This controls the base impulse from a jump (before jump boost or modifier on block).
** Default is 0.42, and the valid range is from 0 to 32.

'''[[Background]]'''
* The menu background dirt texture has been replaced by a darkened background.
** The dirt texture has been moved to the "Programmer Art" resource pack.
** Outside the game, the menu panorama is displayed across all screen.
** In the game, the world is visible across all screens.
** Paired with the darkened background is a blur.
*** The strength of the blur can be configured in accessibility settings.
*** In-game screens such as containers and books are not affected by these changes.
* The animated [[nether portal]] texture is displayed when changing [[dimension]] to or from [[The Nether]].
* The animated [[end portal]] effect is displayed when changing dimension to or from [[The End]].
* After defeating the ender dragon and entering the end portal, the [[end poem]] and credits are now displayed with a background based on the animated end portal effect.

'''Chat'''
* Client chat state (on-screen messages and chat input history) is now preserved by client when entering and exiting configuration phase.
* Message signature chain handling remains unchanged - going into configuration phase starts new session.
* If client has message delay configured, pending messages are delivered immediately before leaving world.
* Server can clear chat state by sending <code>reset_chat</code> packet in configuration phase.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* Using {{key|Ctrl}} or {{key|Command}} + pick block no longer lists "(+NBT)" in the item tooltip.

'''[[Create New World]] screen'''
* Renamed "Allow cheats" to "Allow commands".
** Also applies to "Open to LAN" menu.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>41</code>.
* The {{cd|minecraft:sweeping}} enchantment has been renamed to {{cd|minecraft:sweeping_edge}}.
* [[Loot table]] entry with id loot_table now also accepts inline loot tables.
** Loot table entry {{cd|loot_table}} (which returns all items from provided nested loot table) now has the following syntax: {{cd|value}} - can be either:
*** namespaced id - reference to another named loot table.
*** full loot table (same format as in standalone file).
* [[Banner pattern]]s are now be loaded into the registry from <code>data/<''namespace''>/banner_pattern/<''id''></code>
<div class="treeview">
:* {{nbt|compound}}: The root object.
:** {{nbt|string|asset_id}}: A namespaced id for the texture. e.g. <code>custom:pattern</code> resolves to <code>assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png</code> and <code>assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png</code>.
:** {{nbt|string|translation_key}}: A translation key prefix. e.g. <code>block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern</code> resolves to <code>block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<''color''></code>.
</div>
* Int and float providers used in worldgen definitions are no longer wrapped in an extra <code>value</code> field next to <code>type</code>
** For example, <code>{"type":"minecraft:uniform","value":{"min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}}</code> becomes <code>{"type":"minecraft:uniform","min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}</code>
* The <code>text</code> field within filterable entries in book components has been renamed to <code>raw</code> to avoid ambiguity.
* The <code>profile</code> component and fields on player head items and blocks respectively now support resolving from a UUID.
** By specifying the <code>id</code> field without a <code>name</code>, the <code>name</code> and textures will be looked up.
* Added new terrain adaptation type for structures: <code>encapsulate</code>
** Density will be added all around every piece of a structure
** Ideal for structures that need to be entirely covered underground
* The combination of <code>max_stack_size</code> and <code>max_damage</code> components is no longer allowed in commands and data pack definitions
* Added a new option <code>body</code> in entity <code>equipment</code> sub-predicate to match the item in the body armor slot of an entity
* The <code>saturation_modifier</code> field on the <code>food</code> component has been replaced with <code>saturation</code>
** <code>saturation</code> is the exact value added to the player's saturation level
** In respect to the former <code>saturation_modifier</code>, this is defined by <code>saturation = nutrition * saturation_modifier * 2</code>
* Changed optional <code>equipment_loot_table</code> field in the <code>SpawnPotentials</code> of Monster Spawners and <code>spawn_potentials</code> of Trial Spawner configs.
** Now named <code>equipment</code> instead of <code>equipment_loot_table</code>
** Format: object with fields
*** <code>loot_table</code> - A loot table used to generate the equipment
*** <code>slot_drop_chances</code> - An optional map of equipment slot to specified drop chance
**** Can also be a single value instead of a list to apply to all slots: e.g. <code>slot_drop_chances: 0.0f</code> applies a chance of 0% to all slots
** e.g. <code>equipment: {loot_table: "minecraft:equipment/trial_chamber", slot_drop_chances: {"head": 0.0f, "chest": 0.25f, "legs": 1.0f, "feet": 0.25f}}</code>
** If present, rolled items from the specified loot table are equipped to the mob that spawns.

'''[[Effect]]'''
* The background texture of the small effect UI has been changed.
* The former behavior of effects such as Jump Boost, Levitation, and Mining Fatigue over 127 has been replaced with new attributes.

'''[[Font]]'''
* <code>shift</code> in TTF glyph providers is now restricted to the range <code>[-512;512]</code>.

'''[[Item format/1.20.5|Item stack components]]'''
* Non-default components on item stacks containing block items are now stored on block entities when placed.
* Component removals from defaults are currently not preserved.
* Placing and breaking non-block entity blocks remains unchanged - nothing is preserved.
* Does not automatically cause preserved components to be restored on drops - this requires addition of <code>copy_components</code> function to loot table.
* Components are stored in field called <code>components</code>.
** Some components (like <code>custom_name</code>) are still handled by legacy serialization, which means they might not be present in there.
** Contains map of component id to component value.

'''[[Language]]'''
* Added support for Viossa language.

'''[[options.txt|{{mono|options.txt}}]]'''
* Removed <code>skipRealms32bitWarning</code>.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color.
** All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately.
** The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less.
* Particle options in commands and in fields like <code>Particles</code> in Area Effect clouds now use the same representation as worldgen files (like existing biomes' ambient particle settings)
* For example, command <code>/particle minecraft:dust 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 ...</code> becomes <code>/particle minecraft:dust{color:[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], scale:2.0} ...</code>
* The syntax for particles without extra options (like <code>minecraft:villager</code>) remains unchanged
* Changes to block particles (<code>minecraft:block</code>, <code>minecraft:block_marker</code>, <code>minecraft:falling_dust</code>, <code>minecraft:dust_pillar</code>) options:
** Field <code>value</code> has been renamed to <code>block_state</code>
** Field <code>block_state</code> now also accepts plain block name to represent default block state
** Example transformations:
*** <code>minecraft:block minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=true]</code> -> <code>minecraft:block{block_state: {Name: "minecraft:redstone_lamp", Properties: {lit: "true"}}}</code>
*** <code>minecraft:block minecraft:diamond_block</code> -> <code>minecraft:block{block_state: "minecraft:diamond_block"}</code>
* Changes to <code>minecraft:item</code> options:
** Field <code>value</code> has been renamed to <code>item</code>
** Field <code>item</code> now also accepts plain item name to represent item stack with default components
** <code>count</code> field is now ignored
** Example transformations:
*** <code>minecraft:item minecraft:dirt</code> -> <code>minecraft:item{item: {id: "minecraft:dirt"}}</code>
*** <code>minecraft:item minecraft:dirt</code> -> <code>minecraft:item{item: "minecraft:dirt"}</code>
* Changes to <code>dust_color_transition</code> options:
** Field <code>fromColor</code> has been renamed to <code>from_color</code>
** Field <code>toColor</code> has been renamed to <code>to_color</code>
** Example transformation: <code>dust_color_transition 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.5</code> -> <code>dust_color_transition{from_color: [1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f], scale: 0.5f, to_color: [0.0f, 1.0f, 0.5f]}</code>
* Changes to <code>entity_effect</code> options:
** Field <code>value</code> has been renamed to <code>color</code>
** Field <code>color</code> now also accepts list of floats representing RGBA color

'''Protocol'''
* The <code>minecraft:chat_command_signed</code> packet has been split from <code>minecraft:chat_command</code>.
** Commands that do not accept any signed arguments use the unsigned packet, and do not pass any 'last seen' chat updates.
* Invalid data in packets sent from a server now causes the game client to disconnect.
* Changed the approach to game client disconnecting on invalid data in packets sent from a server.
** To ease the transition period, modded servers can opt out by setting the appropriate field in the <code>handshake/game_profile</code> packet.
** This option will be removed in the next release.

'''[[Recipe]]'''
* Can now specify item component.
** {{nbt|compound|result}} field for {{cd|d=and|crafting_shaped|crafting_shapeless|stonecutting|smithing_transform}} now accepts {{nbt|compound|components}}.
** {{nbt|string|result}} field for {{cd|d=and|smelting|blasting|smoking|campfire_cooking}} recipes are now an item stack without count. That is, {{nbt|string|id}} must be specified and {{nbt|compound|components}} is now accepted.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>32</code>.
* The {{cd|ttf}} font provider transforms have been adjusted to have more reasonable defaults.
** {{cd|shift}} is no longer applied double, and now directly represents a number of pixels in the game UI.
** The font EM square is fitted to {{cd|size}} pixels in the game UI, instead of between the font ascender and font descender.
** The font baseline is positioned consistently with the default font (7 pixels below line top).
** This means that generally, any font with a {{cd|size}} of 9 and no {{cd|shift}} should look correct by default.
* The unused attributes array in core shader definitions has been removed.
* The <code>IViewRotMat</code> uniform has been removed, and the Position attribute for entities is now in (camera relative) world space.
* Light direction uniforms are no longer premultiplied by the view matrix.
* Added texture and model files for vault block.
* The trial key item texture has been changed.
* Added texture and particle file for <code>vault_connection</code> particle.
* Added font variant filters to font providers.
** Every glyph provider can now be enabled or disabled based on certain set of variants.
** Available variants are currently hardcoded and controlled by font options menu.
*** Current variants:
**** <code>uniform</code> - wired to "Force Uniform" button.
**** <code>jp</code> - wired to "Japanese Glyph Variants" button.
** Filters are defined in section called <code>filter</code>, available for every glyph provider.
*** Keys in that object are variant names (for example <code>uniform</code>).
*** Glyph provider is included only when value in filter matches actual value of variant in key.
* Changed Japanese font variants.
** New option has been added to select Japanese variants for some CJK characters.
** Replacement glyphs come from Japanese version of Unifont font.
** New option is included in new "Font Settings" menu, accessible from "Language" menu.
** Default value of this option is based on system locale language setting.
** "Force Unicode" button has been moved to "Font Settings".
* Added additional textures to support colored layers of wolf armor for the wolf model and wolf armor item:
** <code>textures/entity/wolf/wolf_armor_overlay.png</code>

** <code>textures/entity/wolf/wolf_armor_crackiness_low.png</code>
** <code>textures/entity/wolf/wolf_armor_crackiness_medium.png</code>
** <code>textures/entity/wolf/wolf_armor_crackiness_high.png</code>

** Instead, <code>menu_background</code> is used as the background of screens, while <code>menu_list_background</code> is used for the background of lists.
* Lists now use the <code>header_separator</code> and <code>footer_separator</code> textures at the top and bottom, respectively.
* The following textures have been updated: <code>footer_separator</code>, <code>header_separator</code>.
* The following sprites have been updated: <code>widget\tab</code>, <code>widget\tab_highlighted</code>, <code>widget\tab_selected</code>, <code>widget\tab_selected_highlighted</code>.

* Added {{cd|gui/tab_header_background}} texture, which is rendered behind the tab buttons in the Create World Screen.
* Added {{cd|misc/credits_vignette}} texture, which is rendered behind the poem and the credits.
* The {{cd|blur}} post-processing shader has been renamed to {{cd|box_blur}}.
* Added optional boolean field {{cd|use_linear_filter}} to post-processing passes which when set to {{cd|true}} switches texture sampling mode from nearest-neighbor sampling to linear interpolation for that pass.
* Added {{cd|entity_outline_box_blur}} post-processing shader.
* Particle <code>entity_effect</code> takes color argument when spawned from command <code>/particle entity_effect {{cd|r}} {{cd|g}} {{cd|b}} {{cd|a}}</code>.
** 4 float values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 representing RGBA.
* Removed <code>map_icons.png</code>{{more info}}
** Map decoration icons have been split from the former <code>map_icons.png</code> to use an atlas loaded from the <code>textures/map/decorations/</code> directory
* The process of upgrading a pack can be assisted by using an automated Slicer tool.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1.4</ref>
* Added <code>trial_chambers</code> map decoration icon
* Added the following sound events: {{cd|d=and|block.cobweb.break|block.cobweb.step|block.cobweb.place|block.cobweb.hit|block.cobweb.fall|block.trial_spawner.about_to_spawn_item|block.trial_spawner.spawn_item|block.trial_spawner.spawn_item_begin|block.trial_spawner.charge_activate|block.trial_spawner.ambient_charged|item.ominous_bottle.dispose|event.mob_effect.bad_omen|event.mob_effect.trial_omen|event.mob_effect.raid_omen}}

* Added JFR (Java Flight Recorder) events for individual chunk reads (<code>minecraft.ChunkRegionRead</code>) and writes (<code>minecraft.ChunkRegionWrite</code>).
* Introduced changes to optimizing worlds.
** Optimizing singleplayer worlds and running dedicated server with {{cd|forceUpgrade}} now also upgrades contents of {{cd|entities}} and {{cd|poi}} directories of the world.
** New {{cd|recreateRegionFiles}} dedicated server startup parameter.
*** It triggers world optimization similar to {{cd|forceUpgrade}}, but also rewrites all the chunks independently of whether they have been upgraded.
*** This creates fresh and defragmented region files.
*** Using this parameter after changing the {{cd|region-file-compression}} server property recompresses all region files in the new format.
* Improved server TPS debug chart.
** As before, it is accessible by pressing {{cd|F3 + 2}} in a singleplayer world.
** The bottom dark red section of the chart displays the time spent during the main logic of the server tick. It is equivalent to the value displayed in the old chart.
** The light brown section displays time spent on running scheduled tasks.
** The purple section displays time spent executing all other code during the tick.
** The top light green (or yellow or red depending on lag) section displays time spent idling, waiting for next tick.
** The {{cd|min}}, {{cd|avg}}, {{cd|max}} aggregate values are based on the sum of the first 3 sections.
** Allowed server operators to view dedicated server TPS debug chart.
* Maximum length of a command in a function (including macro expansions) can no longer exceed 2,000,000 characters.
* Reduced time needed to generate [[explorer map]]s to [[buried treasure]]s.
* Reduced amount of data sent by the server during login by reusing parts of the vanilla datapack.
* In singleplayer, when errors occur during loading or saving of chunks a warning is shown in a toast.

** Additionally, a warning toast is shown periodically while in game.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the [[Update 1.21]] experimental data pack is enabled, the exception to this is the change to villagers, which takes effect when the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experimental data pack is enabled.

==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Heavy Core JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Heavy core]]'''
* A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a [[breeze rod]] to craft a [[mace]].
* Can be found as a loot reward in [[ominous vault]]s with a chance of 8.3%.
* When placed, it has the same size as a [[player head]], and can be oriented in 12 directions.
* Mining a heavy core is slow - it takes 15 seconds to mine.
** The appropriate tool is the pickaxe.
* Are resistant to explosions: blast resistance matches the one from [[obsidian]].
* Can be waterlogged.

'''[[File:Ominous Trial Spawner.png|32px]] [[Ominous trial spawner]]'''
* A more powerful active phase of the [[trial spawner]] with unique challenges and rewards.
** Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards.
* A trial spawner becomes ominous when it detects a [[player]] with the [[Trial Omen]] effect if:
** Either it is not in [[Trial Spawner#Cooldown|cooldown]].
** Or, it is in cooldown but was not ominous during its last activation. This bypasses the cooldown.
* While active, it:
** Glows blue instead of orange.
** Emits soul flames instead of normal flames.
** Spawns mobs, usually with equipment if they can wear it.
*** Mobs that can wear equipment often spawn with enchanted weapons and armor.
**** Armor enchantments include Protection IV, Projectile Protection IV and Fire Protection IV.
**** Weapon enchantments include Sharpness I, Knockback I, Power I and Punch I.
*** The [[armor]] these mobs wear have [[armor trim]]s applied from the [[trial chambers]].
** Periodically spawns potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs.
*** Based on their location, spawners in an area select a random set of projectiles to spawn.
*** These projectiles always include a single type of [[lingering potion]] from a set of possible status effects.
*** Players are chosen 50% of the time when an ominous trial spawner chooses which entity to drop projectiles on top of.
* Becoming ominous despawns any existing mobs it spawned and resets its challenge.
** It stays ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished.
* When defeated, it ejects a different set of loot to normal trial spawners.
* An ominous [[trial key]] has a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated ominous trial spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject a [[trial key]].

'''[[File:Ominous Vault (active) JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Ominous vault]]'''
* A variant of the [[vault]], with a different texture, that emits soul flames instead of normal flames.
* Can be found throughout the [[trial chambers]] in harder to find places.
* Is unlocked with an [[ominous trial key]].
* Holds a more valuable set of rewards than the normal vault.
* Can provide some particularly valuable items, to mention a few:
** [[File:Ominous Bottle JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Ominous bottle]] ('''[[Bad Omen]]''' level III - V)
** [[File:Enchanted Golden Apple JE2 BE2.gif|32px]] [[Enchanted golden apple]]

*** [[Density]]

'''[[File:Vault JE6 BE5.png|32px]] [[Vault]]'''
* A block containing loot that can be unlocked with [[trial key]]s.
** Found throughout [[trial chambers]].
** {{control|Using}} a trial key on a vault unlocks it, making it eject loot.
* Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players.
** It can be only activated once per [[player]]. After a player has unlocked a vault, they cannot unlock that vault again.
** If a player has not unlocked that vault before, an orange stream of particles flows from the player to the vault when nearby.
* Has a keyhole that opens or closes depending on the players nearby.
** If any nearby player has not unlocked that vault, the keyhole opens.
** If all nearby players have unlocked that vault, the keyhole remains closed.
* Within its cage, it cycles through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table.
* The rewards it ejects are randomized from its loot table each time it is unlocked.
** The player gets no more than 1 unstackable item per vault.
** The player more often gets rewards which can stack together.
* Cannot be crafted or obtained in Survival, and does not drop anything when mined.
* Explosion-resistant and cannot be moved.
* Can eject:

'''[[File:Mace JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] [[Mace]]'''
* A new heavy weapon that can be crafted from a [[breeze rod]] and a [[heavy core]].
* Using the weapon while falling can increase the damage output. The higher the player falls, the more damage is dealt.
** This can be done by jumping toward the target and hitting them before the player hits the ground.
** Successfully striking a target in this way negates any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a [[wind charge]] works, as well as resets all vertical momentum.
** Maces have a unique explosive particle effect when executing a smash attack with the mace to really show the player's power.
** Maces have a unique sound when hitting an entity from a fall of more than 5 blocks.
** Other entities near the struck enemy receive knockback, even stronger when falling for more than 5 blocks before attacking.

* Point to a nearby [[trial chamber]].

'''[[File:Wind Charge (item) JE1 BE1.png|x32px]] [[Wind charge]]'''
* It can now be obtained as an [[item]] by the [[player]].
* Can be crafted from [[breeze rod]]s.
* When used it fires off a wind charge projectile similar to the [[breeze]]'s.
* A wind charge fired by a player grants 10% more knockback than a breeze's, but has a much smaller area of impact.
* Just like the [[projectile]] fired by the [[breeze]], wind charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly, and they activate [[redstone]] components.
* There is a half-second cooldown after each use.
* Wind charges can be fired from a [[dispenser]].
* Players that launch themselves with a wind charge only accumulate fall damage below the [[Altitude|Y-level]] of where they collided with the wind burst.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[File:Bogged JE2 BE2.png|width=64x64]] [[Bogged]]'''
* A new, mossy and mushroom covered variant of the [[skeleton]] that shoots poisonous arrows.
** Is faster to take down with {{hp|16}} health instead of {{hp|20}} health.
** Attack at a slower interval of {{convert|3.5|seconds|ticks}} instead of skeletons' {{convert|2|seconds|ticks}}.
* Has a chance to drop [[arrows of Poison]] when killed by a [[player]].
* Drops 2 [[mushroom]]s (either both red/brown or one of each) when [[shear]]ed.
* Spawns naturally in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s.
** They're somewhat rare, with their spawn chance being half of that of the skeleton.
** As opposed to [[stray]]s and [[husk]]s, bogged do not require sky access to spawn, and they can also spawn in caves.
* Can spawn from [[trial spawner]]s in some [[trial chambers]]. These spawners now replace the ones that spawn skeletons shooting arrows of Poison.

==== Command format ====
'''Loot functions'''
* Added <code>set_ominous_bottle_amplifier</code> loot function.
** Sets the <code>ominous_bottle_amplifier</code> component on the target item according to a number provider.
*** <code>conditions</code>: list of conditions to filter this function
*** <code>amplifier</code>: a number provider used to generate the <code>ominous_bottle_amplifier</code> component

'''{{Animate|Bad Omen JE3 BE3.png; Raid Omen JE2 BE1.png; Bad Omen JE3 BE3.png; Trial Omen JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Ominous event]]s'''
* Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in trial chambers.
* These optional experiences accessed through [[Bad Omen]] are now known as ominous events.
** They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways.
** Illager [[raid]]s are an example of an existing ominous event.
* Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
** It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player.
** It no longer triggers a raid directly when entering a village.
*** Instead, it transforms into [[Raid Omen]] with a duration of 30 seconds.
*** Once the Raid Omen expires, a raid starts at the location the player gained the Raid Omen.
*** Like any other effect, players can drink a bucket of milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the raid from starting.
** It is no longer given to players that defeat a raid captain outside a raid.
*** Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new ominous bottle.

==== General ====
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the following block tag:
** {{cd|#blocks_wind_charge_explosions}}: contains {{cd|d=and|barrier|bedrock}}
*** Controls which blocks are not impacted by the explosion when hit by [[wind charge]].
* Added the following entity type tags:
