'''Frozen peaks''' are snowy [[mountain]] peak biomes made out of [[ice]] and [[packed ice]] covered by [[snow block]]s.

== Description ==
The frozen peaks are covered by snow, snow blocks, with glaciers of [[packed ice]] and occasional small blobs of ice. Packed ice cliffs can generate in steep sides to the east or north with only a layer of snow covering them. Because this biome generates in positive [[World generation#Biomes|weirdness]], this biome usually generates in smaller and smoother hills, but it can also generate on taller and more jagged and pointy peaks but less compared to the [[jagged peaks]] biome. Frozen peaks generate in temperate, cold, and snowy biome temperature ranges. Frozen peaks generate in positive weirdness. This biome generates next to most [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], [[flower forest]]s, most [[forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[dark forest]]s, [[taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, [[snowy plains]], [[ice spikes]], and [[snowy taiga]]s. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], frozen peaks use default environmental settings with a strong cold color grading, making the biome appear icy blue.
