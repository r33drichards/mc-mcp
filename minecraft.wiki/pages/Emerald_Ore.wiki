'''Emerald ore''' is a rare [[mineral]] block that generates only in [[mountains]] and [[windswept hills]] biomes. It drops [[emerald]]s when mined, or itself if mined with a [[pickaxe]] with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment.

'''Deepslate emerald ore''' is a very rare variant of emerald ore that can generate in [[deepslate]] and [[tuff]] blobs.

{{See also|Fortune#Ore}}
Emerald ore can be mined with an [[iron pickaxe]] or better, otherwise it drops nothing. If mined without Silk Touch, the block drops 1 [[emerald]] (or up to 4 with [[Fortune]]). If mined with a pickaxe with Silk Touch, the block drops itself. It also drops {{xp|3|7}} when broken.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}

Emerald ore generates in [[mountains]] and [[windswept hills]] biomes in the form of [[Ore (feature)|ore feature]]s, and attempts to generate 100 times per [[chunk]] in blobs of 0–4 ores. Emerald ore can be exposed to the sky.<ref>{{bug|MC-237455|||WAI}}</ref>

Specifically, it can be found in the following biomes:

* {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
* {{BiomeLink|Cherry Grove}}
* {{BiomeLink|Grove}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes}}
* {{BiomeLink|Jagged Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Frozen Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Stony Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Gravelly Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Forest}}
Emerald ore generates from [[altitude|levels]] -16 to 320, having the greatest chance at level 232, and becoming less common toward either end of the range. However, because there is little to no terrain in the upper half of that range in regular worlds, the actual emerald ore quantity peaks around level 90 as seen in the empirical distribution graph below.

{{Block distribution}}

Emerald ore can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. Emerald ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate emerald ore, which is the rarest ore in ''Minecraft'', rarer than normal emerald ore and [[ancient debris]], even rarer than its second-place competitor, (non-deepslate) [[diamond ore]]. It generates only between the altitudes of -16 and 8 where deepslate naturally occurs, which happens to be toward the end of emerald ore distribution where it is extremely rare; its limitation to certain biomes further adds to its rarity.

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w21b|[[File:Emerald Ore JE2 BE1.png|30px]] The texture of emerald ore has been corrected. The previous ruby texture remains as "ruby.png". Translations of emerald as diamond have also been corrected. 
|An analysis of a 500×500 [[extreme hills]] biome with [https://www.mcedit.net/ MCEdit] gives the following ore distributions:
<gallery>
Ore distribution 0 to 32.jpg|Overall ore distribution in the bottom most 32 layers.
Ore distribution 0 to 32 zoom.jpg|A detailed zoom to the rare ores.
</gallery>
The graphs show that the distribution of all [[ore]]s except for [[lapis lazuli]] is even in a certain range and falls off sharply at the borders. While the total amount of emerald is with 3386, even higher than the amount of diamonds (2997), the ore is spread out over double the [[altitude|height range]], meaning that at a certain level the chance for finding an ore was just about half of the chance of finding a diamond ore, effectively making it twice as rare when tunnel mining.}}

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Emerald Ore|Deepslate Emerald Ore}}

== Trivia ==
* Even though emerald ore is rarer than [[diamond ore]], emerald ore is generally found more often in mountains biomes than diamond ore, as the emerald ore blocks are generated in a more scattered fashion.
* Excluding blocks generated by structures, deepslate emerald ore is one of the rarest<ref>{{ytl|Nry1FeGmmYM}}</ref> naturally-generated blocks in ''[[Minecraft]]'', as emeralds only spawn in mountainous biomes, and spawn less at lower [[Altitude|Y-level]]s. They also spawn in veins of 1, and require Silk Touch to drop themselves.
* Contrasting with the ore, [[trading]] with [[villagers]] yields easier non-ore emeralds, renewably.
