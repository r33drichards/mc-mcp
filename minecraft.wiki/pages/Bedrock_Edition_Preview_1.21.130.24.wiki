'''API'''
* Moved Loot Table Discovery APIs from {{cd|beta}} into {{cd|2.4.0}}.
* Released {{cd|BlockRedstoneProducerComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.4.0}}.
* Released {{cd|InvalidBlockComponentError}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.4.0}}.

** Moved {{cd|LiquidSettings}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.4.0}}.

'''Entity Components'''
* Upgraded the {{cd|minecraft:addrider}} entity component, allowing it to take an array of riders.
** Description:
*** Allows a rideable mob to spawn with one or more riders.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|"riders"}}: Array of riders to add to the entity, with the mandatory field {{cd|entity_type}} and optional field {{cd|spawn_event}}.
** {{cd|riders}} Fields:
*** {{cd|entity_type}}: The type of mob to spawn.
*** {{cd|spawn_event}}: An optional event to spawn with the mob.
** Requirements:
*** The mob must have a {{cd|minecraft:rideable}} entity component.
*** The array of riders must be no longer than {{cd|minecraft:rideable}} has {{cd|seat_count}}.
* Added new boolean field {{cd|can_dehydrate}} to {{cd|minecraft:breathable}}.
** The field defaults to {{cd|false}} to preserve previous breathable behavior. When set to {{cd|true}}, entities that only breathe water will take dehydration damage when out of water.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", "Upcoming Creator Features" [[experimental]] toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
* Added {{cd|EntitySwingSource}} for providing context of player swings to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent.swingSource}} to {{cd|beta}}.
* Added {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions.swingSource}} to {{cd|beta}}.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* Added new state {{cd|minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction}} to the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} block trait, which enables the {{cd|minecraft:corner}} with values {{cd|none}}, {{cd|inner_left}}, {{cd|inner_right}}, {{cd|outer_left}}, and {{cd|outer_right}} to provide similar behavior to how stairs in Vanilla work.
** When this is set, you can use the field {{cd|blocks_to_corner_with}} to decide the criteria with an array of block descriptors to determine what blocks to form a corner with.
*** With the Beta APIs toggle on, Vanilla Stairs have the tag {{cd|minecraft:cornerable_stairs}} available, and can corner with custom blocks with the same tag if the block also uses {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} block states.
*** The default behavior for this field is to corner with the same block name.
**** This all requires the Beta APIs toggle to be enabled on a world and the {{cd|use_beta_features}} flag on your block.
