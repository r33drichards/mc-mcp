== Gameplay ==
The game can be played entirely using a mouse, lacking any movement or mechanics beyond clicking text boxes. The only visible button during gameplay is a soundbar, enabling the player to mute the game if desired. If the player ever receives an ending, a restart button will become visible in the top-left corner. Despite lacking an icon, this functionality actually exists throughout the rest of the game, returning the player to the first screen of exposition if clicked.

== Summary ==
{{Expand section|Explain every path and context for the ending}}
The game is set at Device High, a premium high school for "the best-performing pieces of portable technology from across the country." The protagonist, Winsten, is the new {{Wikipedia|Windows 10}} PC in class, having aced an entry exam, but is anxious attending a cross-platform school. They got dropped off by their parents, feeling their internal fan spinning with nervousness, pondering if anyone plays [[Pocket Edition|''Pocket Edition'']]. Having some spare time before class, they decide to go one of three directions: to the rooftop, the art studio, or registration.

If Winsten heads onto the roof, they will remark about their lack of experience climbing stairs, before noticing {{Wikipedia|iOS}} models relaxing. Finding the place a good spot to be alone, they take a deep breath, only to be interrupted by an {{Wikipedia|Android (operating system)|Android}} device named Andy, who accuses Winsten of "hogging the air." If the player reasons with them, such as apologizing or recognizing they're an Android device, Andy will be revealed as cheeky and try to give advice.

If at any point Winsten chooses not to use cross-play or refuse to associate with a character, they will become obsolete, ending the game.

== Quotes ==
{{q|Your dismissive nature escalates during your time at Device High.

You graduate successfully but become close-minded, refusing to upgrade your firmware and dismissing any technology that requires you to conquer even the shallowest of learning curves.

Soon, you find yourself outdated and alone...|Bad ending text crawl}}
