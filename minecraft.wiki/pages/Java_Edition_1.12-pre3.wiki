'''1.12-pre3'''<ref name=1.12-pre3>{{Mcnet|minecraft-112-pre-release-3|Minecraft 1.12 Pre-Release 3}}</ref> is the third pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.12]].

It was later reuploaded due to an issue with advancements crashing the game.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|864845511966281728|If you don't have any advancements, yes! Working on it.|May 17, 2017}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added [[Resistance]] to the list of required effects in the "How Did We Get Here?" hidden challenge.
** Now gives 1000 [[experience]] as a reward.
* Added more required food items to the "A Balanced Diet" challenge.
** Now requires both types of golden apples, both types of cooked fish, and four types of raw fish (previously only one in each group), which brings the total number of needed foods from 30 to 35.
* Advancements now remember the tab that was last selected.
* Changed <code>requirements</code> of advancements to an AND of ORs.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* Added new keybinding for opening advancements (default "L").

'''[[Function (Java Edition)|Function]]s'''
* Now use a new file extension ".mcfunction" instead of ".txt".

'''[[Sounds]]'''
* Added new sounds for sound events <code>entity.player.hurt_drown</code> and <code>entity.player.hurt_on_fire</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Parrot]]s'''
* Changed parrots to be tamed with [[seeds]], not [[cookie]]s.
** Attempting to feed a parrot a cookie instantly kills the parrot.
*** The parrot gives off [[Poison]] particles as it dies.
*** Displays the message "''Parrot was slain by <player>''".
* Allowed parrots to spawn in old jungles.

'''[[Wither]]s'''
* Can no longer break end gateway blocks and piston extensions.

=== General ===
'''[[Function (Java Edition)|Function]]s'''
* Commands on each line no longer begin with "/" (forwards slash).
* Now only use "#" to comment (not "//").
* Functions should recurse as expected, even while mixing {{cmd|function}} and {{cmd|execute}}.

'''Optimizations'''
* Huge optimizations to both [[recipe book]] and [[Creative inventory]] searching.
* Some optimizations to advancements.

'''[[Tutorial hints]]'''
* Now smarter about deciding whether or not to display.
