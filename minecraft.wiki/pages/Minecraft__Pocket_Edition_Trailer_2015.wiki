'''Minecraft: Pocket Edition Trailer 2015''' is a trailer for ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' released in 2015. The video was entirely composed of footage from a mobile device, prefaced at the start of the video.

== Summary ==
The video opens on [[Steve]] [[fishing]] at a lake, as Alex chases an ocelot in the background. Steve notices their presence, and brings them [[Raw Cod|fish]] to tame the [[cat]]. The three retreat to an [[Log|acacia]] mansion with [[podzol]] roads, where Alex decides to [[brew]] a [[potion of Invisibility]]. Later, Steve and Alex board minecarts down into a mine decorated with [[Leaves|vegetation]] and [[Mushroom Block|mushrooms]]. After the trek they find a blob of [[diamond ore]], and begin mining it with [[iron pickaxe]]s.

From there they light a [[Nether portal]], and two more [[players]] approach, named FranktheFarmer and BethTheBandit. All four emerge in [[the Nether]], taking on a [[ghast]] head-on, followed by [[magma cube]]s, and then [[blaze]]s. They return to the mansion, and begin placing down blocks such as [[glass pane]]s and [[fence]]s, before tending to various farm animals, such as [[sheep]]. The scene shifts to a large machine made of [[quartz slab]]s and [[redstone lamp]]s, where Steve is playing [[note block]]s. Alex sets off [[TNT]], which is implied to kill Steve. 

The four players converge in a garden, before heading off through a [[taiga]] to a [[plains]] [[village]]. A [[zombie]] kills and infects a [[butcher]], creating a [[zombie villager]]. All four players rush in and begin fighting the monsters, ending the video.
