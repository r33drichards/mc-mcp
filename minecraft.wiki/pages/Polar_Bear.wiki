'''Polar bears''' are large [[neutral mobs]] that live in icy [[biome]]s. Adult polar bears are protective of their babies, attacking [[player]]s that get too close or attack any babies near them.

== Spawning ==
Polar bears spawn in [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]], [[Ice Spikes|ice spikes]], [[Frozen ocean|frozen]] and [[deep frozen ocean]] biomes, and additionally/sometimes in [[frozen river]], [[legacy frozen ocean]], [[snowy slopes]], [[jagged peaks]], and [[frozen peaks]] biomes {{in|BE}}. They spawn in groups of up to two, above [[ice]]. {{IN|JE}}, polar bears don't spawn on ice in snowy plains and ice spikes biomes. If there is a group, the second polar bear is a baby.

* {{xp|1|3}} from player or tamed [[wolves]] kills.

Killing a baby polar bear yields no [[item]]s or [[experience]].

== Behavior ==
[[File:Polar Bear attacking.gif|thumb|150px|A polar bear attacking.]]
Polar bears can be passive, neutral, or hostile depending on the situation. Baby polar bears are passive, and adults are neutral; becoming hostile when a player either directly attacks it or when the player comes close to or attacks any baby polar bears near it (unless killed in one hit{{Only|java|short=yes}}).

If a baby polar bear is attacked, unless killed in one hit{{only|java|short=yes}}, all adults within a 41×21×41 area become hostile toward the player or mob, regardless of difficulty, although in Peaceful difficulty their attacks do zero damage to players.

{{IN|java}}, attacking an adult who is within a 16×8×16 area of a cub also provokes other adults within a 21×21×21 area of the attacked adult.

Polar bears also attack [[fox]]es.
* Adult polar bears attack any fox that stays near it for a while, hitting it once every few seconds. Baby polar bears are more aggressive and attack foxes within 16 blocks.

Polar bears attack by rearing on their back legs and mauling down with their front paws. Their swimming speed is equal to the player's, making them difficult to get away from if they are attacking in [[water]]. 

Polar bears are immune to freezing damage from [[powder snow]].

Unlike most animal mobs, polar bears cannot [[breed]]. Baby polar bears can only be found when they naturally spawn. A baby polar bear eventually turns into an adult after 24000 ticks (20 minutes), and their growth cannot be sped up.

== Trivia ==

*Adding polar bears to ''Minecraft'' was a request by [[Jeb]]'s wife, she was told they'd be added "if they ever had a bear of their own". Once their son was born, he was named "Björn" (Swedish for "bear"), and polar bears were added.<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-polar-bear|We have a room in our house where all polar bear-related items end up. It’s essentially the library, or a hallway, really, with all our books in it, and there are two chairs so you can sit and read if you want - but we have a polar bear tapestry on the wall, and lots of polar bear plushies. So it feels like a Polar Bear room. Jenny had been nagging me for a long time to add a bear to Minecraft. And so I told her - well, if we ever have a bear of our own, I’ll add a bear in Minecraft. And then it turned true, because our son was born and we called him Björn - which means bear in Swedish! So I had to add a bear in the game. - JENS BERGENSTEN}}</ref>
*Unlike most other baby mobs, baby polar bears have a unique sound effect that is not just a sped-up version of the regular polar bear sound effects; this is also reflected in [[subtitles]].
*During the development of the frozen ocean biome, polar bears were removed from spawning, due to being deemed too "sad". They were added back in because it is more accurate to the polar bear's real life status.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://clips.twitch.tv/DreamyCaringShingleNomNom|title=Polar bears were originally removed from iceberg biomes|author=CBSUnstoppable|website=Twitch}}</ref>
