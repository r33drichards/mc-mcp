[[File:Atlas_blue.svg|alt=The logo used for the Atlas website, for program members to manage their map submissions.|border|right]]
The '''Java Realms Content Creator Program''',<ref name=":0">https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/realms-page-content-creator</ref> or simply '''Java Creators''',<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskar-thysell-4ba41bba/</ref> is an official [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] program for mapmakers to publish their custom maps on [[Realms]] for [[Java Edition|''Minecraft: Java Edition'']]. Maps published through the program are added to a content library for Realms subscribers to easily install and play, provided the map functions as intended in the latest stable release of the game.

The initiative was founded by [[Marc Watson]] in 2013, and is currently led by [[Oskar Thysell]].

== Program ==
To apply for the program, one should submit a map that they have made on the Realms subreddit [https://reddit.com/r/realms r/realms]. The submission is placed in a queue to be reviewed by a Mojang content coordinator. Only one submission per user may be in the queue at any given time.

Once the submission has been reviewed and approved, the uploader is given access to the [https://atlas.minecraft.net Atlas submission portal], as well as the Slack workspace and the Discord server for program members. They may then submit the map and any future maps via Atlas, where they will be placed in a queue for full reviews by a Mojang content coordinator. After a map passes the full review, it will be scheduled for publishing in the current or next month, and announced via a blog post on [https://minecraft.net minecraft.net].

If a map on Atlas involves multiple creators, they may be given access to the Slack workspace and Discord server, but they may not access Atlas unless they themselves have gotten an approved submission on the subreddit ''or'' have a [[Realms MapMaker Cape|mapmaker cape]] from creating enough maps.

All submissions and published maps must follow the [https://atlas.minecraft.net/guidelines Realms Map Guidelines]. [[Oskar Thysell|Oskar]] and [[Nadja Anderberg|Nadja]] are the content coordinators as of April 2025.

=== Categories ===
The program currently publishes content under one of the following five categories<ref name=":0" />:

* '''Minigames''' - Short, self-contained, and repeatable game modes.
* '''World Templates''' - A way for players to start a new survival game with something extra, such as a castle or a village.
* '''Adventures''' - Longer experiences, meant to be played from start to finish.
* '''Experience''' - Maps without a defined goal, like a theme park. ''(Following September 2025, this category is no longer accepting new maps, and existing maps will be gradually moved to other categories.)''
* '''Inspiration''' - Visually informative creations designed to inspire potential builders.

=== History ===
In the earliest stages of Realms, mapmakers could not apply to have their maps added to Realms. Instead, they were contacted by Mojang directly.<ref>Confirmed by Oskar Thysell during a meeting on April 16th, 2025.</ref>{{failed verification}} The current program application process was likely established somewhere in 2014.<ref name=":0" />

=== Java Realms Day ===
Java Realms Day is an "annual December tradition which is totally legit"<ref>Oskar's announcement message in the private Slack workspace, sent December 3rd, 2025</ref> that marks the year's final release of new Realms maps. It always happens on the third Friday of December<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-on-java-realms-december-20250</ref>, which is typically the last day before Mojang goes on holiday break. All other monthly releases occur on the final (non-holiday) Friday of the month.

== List of maps ==
{{Missing information|the name of two unknown maps from December 2013 and March 2018, the release date of Memory Battle and TNT Run, and the category of most maps}}
The "availability" column indicates if the map is still available for install on Realms as of November 2025.

== Cape ==
{{main|Realms MapMaker Cape|title1=Realms MapMaker Cape}}
Mapmakers who have made a number of published maps may become eligible for a cape. This number varies depending on the categories of the maps, ranging from 2 to 4.

From 2019<ref>{{tweet|TheChopper2112|1372362209641295874|We've had a few small gatherings but nothing official until 2019. This year was the third official one I suppose.|March 17, 2021}}</ref> to 2023, yearly photo events were organized in which as many capeholders as possible would gather in one server to take a screenshot together. From 2024 onward, this has been replaced by other photo events that allow all mapmakers to participate, even if they do not have a cape.<gallery>

== Map Jam ==
A map jam (also spelled Mapjam or MapJam) is an event in which participants must create a map within a certain timeframe that follows one or more themes provided by the organizer. Since 2024, the Java Creators Program has held yearly map jams, where the winning 3 maps would be published on Realms. The official Discord server can be joined through [https://discord.gg/bKHvJusFUa this invite link].

=== Java Realms Creators 10th Anniversary Mapjam ===
In 2024, as part of the anniversary celebration, a '''Java Realms Creators 10th Anniversary Mapjam''' was held from 12:00 UTC April 6th to 12:00 UTC April 11th, 2024.<ref>{{Reddit2|sub=realms|id=1bq01rr|text=The Java Realms Creators 10th Anniversary Mapjam|author=Cultural_Result_6975}}</ref><ref name=":1">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ornjKlMOZ4HZBWh8l1HET--A09U2FY5JT6bTug-5LXo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dqp5a17hxj00</ref> Participants were allowed to form teams with up to 3 members. The maps were judged by [[Oskar Thysell|Oskar]], Aandel, Edou_ and Flcme based on four criteria: Creativity, Visuals, Execution and Experience. Each criterion was graded from 0 to 40, for a combined maximum score of 160, and the top 3 maps were to be published on Realms.

An additional community vote was held alongside the official judging, where the top 3 maps could win Discord Nitro gifts.

The main themes were Cosmos and Mythology, and the side themes were Antique and Odyssey.<ref name=":2">{{ytl|JTDllO5y3Ak|How I WON Mojang's Map Making Contest|MrCube6|March 13, 2025}}</ref> Participants were required to incorporate at least one main theme and one side theme in their submission.<ref name=":1" />

'''28''' maps were submitted by the end of the event. The winning three maps were published to Realms on [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-on-realms-november-2024 November 29th, 2024].

=== The Java Creators MapJam ===
Following the positive reception of last year's map jam, a new map jam was held from 02:00 UTC May 23rd to 02:00 UTC May 27th, 2025. Similar to last year, participants formed teams with up to 3 members. The maps were judged by [[Oskar Thysell|Oskar]], Flcme, TheWorfer27 and [[Nadja Anderberg|Nadja]], based on four criteria: Builds, Gameplay, Functionality and Theming. Each criterion were graded from 0 to 10 for a maximum of 40 points, then the average is calculated for the final score.

Five themes were announced at the start of the jam, and all map submissions must incorporate at least two of them. The five themes (and the amount of maps that incorporated said theme<ref>According to flcme on Discord, May 27th, 2025</ref>{{failed verification}}) were '''Outnumbered''' (7), '''Takes Two''' (15), '''Deep Below''' (18), '''Rebuild''' (6), and '''Mutation''' (6).

158 participants across 80 teams signed up for the mapjam. '''39''' maps were submitted by the end of the event (2 of which were disqualified for using premade assets). Four of the multiplayer-only maps were played by the judges live at [https://www.twitch.tv/violinetries Nadja's Twitch channel] on June 4th 2025.
