== Synopsis ==

[[Hero Crowe’s Adventure School]] is the stuff of legends. Every year, aspiring heroes across the [[Overworld]] wait to see where the mysterious school will pop up this time. But before students can even make it to the front steps, they must pass a dangerous admissions test.

[[Belinda]] knows she can pass. She has to pass. She needs to prove to everyone (most of all herself) that she’s not a coward, and she is certain that winning the school’s glorious chest of rare, valuable items is the way to do it. She just needs to make sure she wins without revealing too much about her past.

Belinda has competition, though. She and countless other students are up against hair-raising [[Mob|mobs]], secret rooms, and saboteurs, facing challenge after challenge as they battle their way through Hero Crowe’s unusual "lessons". While some students think working together is the best strategy, others prefer the whole lone wolf thing. After all, Hero said there could be only one victor.

Navigating new friendships, rivalries, and plenty of danger, Belinda discovers just what it takes to be a hero. But in the end, will she win the prize and become the school’s one true hero?<ref name=MCAdventure/>
