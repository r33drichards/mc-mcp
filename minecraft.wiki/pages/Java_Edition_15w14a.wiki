'''15w14a''' is an [[April Fools' Day jokes#2015|April Fools' joke]] snapshot released on April 1, 2015.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150401075342/https://www.mojang.com/2015/04/minecraft-snapshot-15w14a-the-love-and-hugs-update/</ref> It was released as a hoax announcement for "'''1.10'''", which Mojang named '''The Love and Hugs Update''' (unrelated to the [[Java Edition 1.9|actually released]] update and [[Java Edition 1.10|the update released with the same version number]], the Frostburn Update). No further snapshots were released for the hoax update. This snapshot is a fork of [[Java Edition 1.8.3|1.8.3]], which was the latest release at the time.

This is the first publicly available April Fools' Day version of {{JE}}. The previous version in this "series", [[Java Edition 2.0|2.0]], was only officially released to certain individuals, though copies of it can be found.

== Additions ==
{{Additions table|Obsidian Boat|Potion of Caring (Slowness)|Potion of Caring (Poison)|Potion of Sharing|Splash Potion of Caring (Slowness)|Splash Potion of Caring (Poison)|Splash Potion of Sharing}}

=== Gameplay ===
'''"Love" meter'''
* Appears like the health bar, only across the whole top of the experience bar.
* Fills up when the player takes damage or left-clicks on mobs.
* There is a 10 second (200 tick) cool-down on adding hearts.
* Resets upon quitting the world.
* One line of hearts is 23 hearts.
* Collecting eight lines of hearts unlocks a game called Minescreeper, which is Minesweeper textured like ''Minecraft''.
** On the top of the screen is the ''Minecraft'' logo, with "CRAFT" crossed out and "SCREEPER" written over it.
** The game contains a grid of grass block tops, which when left clicked become dirt blocks with the numbers depicting how many bombs are touching that block.
*** The size of the grid varies based on the GUI scale, and the game resolution, though the amount of creepers remains the same. At the default resolution and GUI scale, the grid size is 8×25.
** The flags from Minesweeper are replaced with signs, which can be placed with a right-click.
** The mines are replaced with creepers. Any creeper that was marked with a sign has their mouth upside down.
** Pressing the keys {{key|X}}, {{key|Y}}, {{key|Z}}, {{key|Z}}, {{key|Y}}, {{key|Shift+Enter}}, {{key|Enter}} in this order (just like the classic Minesweeper) plays the level-up sound and activates a cheat that shows if a square is safe or has a mine under it with a white square in the top left corner.
** Winning the game or placing a sign before the first left click triggers the credits, which upon exiting returns the player to normal ''Minecraft''.

=== Blocks and items ===
'''[[File:Obsidian Boat (item).png|32px]] [[Obsidian Boat]]'''
* Sinks instead of floating.
* Can be crafted with the following recipe:
{{crafting
|A2 = Obsidian
|C2 = Obsidian
|A3 = Obsidian
|B3 = Obsidian
|C3 = Obsidian
|Output= Obsidian Boat
|ignoreusage=1
}}
* Has an ID name of <code>minecraft:obsidian_boat</code> and an item number of 432.

'''[[File:Potion of Slowness JE1 BE1.png|32px]][[File:Potion of Poison JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Potion of Caring]]'''
* Changes the mob AI to move toward the nearest mob as if it were to attack it.
* Replaces the data value of both potions of Slowness and potions of Poison.

'''[[File:Potion of Weakness JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Potion of Sharing]]'''
* Causes affected entities to drop items in a random amount of time, ranging from food to rare items like [[saddle]]s or [[diamond]]s.
* Replaces the data value of potions of Weakness.
<!-- do not add potions of Fun or potions of Happiness. They were simply renamed, so they are already listed below -->

*** The "Allow Cheats" button now states "Allow Superpowers".

== Issues ==
* 15w14a is not supported due to being an [[wikipedia:April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke, and therefore issues affecting it will be closed as "Invalid" in the issue tracker.<ref>{{bug|MC-79234|||Invalid}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* 15w14a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* Worlds created in this version get saved as "existence.af15", presumably standing for "Existence [Reference to the world name] April Fools 2015".
* The reason why this version was claimed to be a snapshot for 1.10 rather than 1.9 is unknown.
** It could be speculated to maybe be reference to the joke [https://english.stackexchange.com/q/556931 "seven ate (eight) nine"],  or alternatively, and perhaps more likely, a reference to the successor to Windows 8 being Windows 10.
