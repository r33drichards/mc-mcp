A '''six-sided piston''' was an extreme metadata variant of the [[piston]]. It could be used as [[update suppression]] agents.
[[File:Six-sided piston BE.png|thumb|Six-sided piston {{in|pe}}]]

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
Six-sided pistons can be broken in the same way normal pistons can. They cannot be obtained as an item, instead dropping normal pistons.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Six-sided Piston|Pickaxe|sprite=all pistons}}

=== BUD piston method ===
Six-sided pistons of metadata value 7 could be created if a placed piston updates a BUD-powered piston, such that it pushes or pulls the placed piston.

=== Block transmutation ===
Multiple [[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation|block transmutation methods]] can be used to create Six-sided Pistons {{in|JE}}. From Beta 1.7.2 to Beta 1.9 Pre-releases, Six-sided Pistons can be created using moving piston merge transmutation, from Beta 1.7.3 to 1.2.3, can be created using water transmutation, and from 13w36a-1 to 1.7.5 and 14w02a to 14w11b, can be created using arrow transmutation.

=== <samp>[[Commands/setblock|/setblock]]</samp> and <samp>[[Commands/fill|/fill]]</samp> method ===
Six-sided pistons can be obtainable using the {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}} command. (e.g <code>/setblock ~ ~ ~ piston (or sticky_piston) metadata value beyond 6</code>){{more info}}

== Usage ==

=== Update suppression ===
When powered, six-sided pistons of metadata 6 immediately crash the game. This game crash happens so quick that block updates are not processed correctly, and this can allow for otherwise-impossible arrangements of blocks to be achieved.

Every time the six-sided pistons is updated while receiving power, the game crashes again, so having it be in a position where it receives constant updates is not recommended due to effectively softlocking the world. Depowering the six-sided pistons should make it safe again. This has a possibility of corrupting singleplayer worlds, and it is much safer to perform this on a hosted server.

Analysis of the behavior of metadata 6 six-sided pistons using 1.7 releases and 1.8 snapshots suggests that they remain at data value 6 permanently, even upon loading a world, as opposed to converting to data value 14 - if they do indeed convert, this conversion is not saved.

== History ==
{{info needed section|From the Bedrock Edition removed blocks page: "Running the block on the higher versions, such as 1.16.0, replaces an normal piston but in random directions." Can we figure out what data values correspond to what resultant directions, or is it truly random?}}
