===Crafting===
All stairs have the same crafting recipe format, where six blocks result in four stairs of the same type. Like [[axe]]s, the crafting recipe of stairs can be horizontally flipped.

===Stonecutting===
All stairs except wooden stairs and bamboo mosaic stairs can be obtained by stonecutting. This is more efficient than crafting them, since each block directly results in one stair of the same type.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
[[File:Stairs reconfiguration.png|thumb|'''Stairs Reconfiguration''' — ''Left:'' Original facing when separate. ''Right:'' Changed shape when adjacent (''top:'' inner corner; ''bottom:'' outer corner).]]
To place stairs, {{control|use}} a stairs item while pointing at a surface facing the space the stairs should occupy. When placed, a stair orients itself with the half-block side closest to the [[player]].

Stairs can be placed either right side up or upside-down:
* Pointing at a [[block]] top or the bottom half of a block side places the stairs right side up.
* Pointing at a block bottom or the top half of a block side places the stairs upside-down.

Stairs change their shape to join with adjacent stairs (of any material):
* When a stairs' half-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs' full-block side wraps into an "L" shape to join the other stairs (it creates an "inner corner").
* When a stairs' full-block side is adjacent to the side of another stairs, the stairs' full-block side shortens to join the other stairs' full-block side (it creates an "outer corner").

Right side up stairs do not join with upside-down stairs and vice versa.

=== Walking ===
[[Walking]] up stairs is faster than [[jumping]] up the same distance. Walking up a stairway doesn't cost any [[Hunger#Exhaustion level increase|exhaustion]] from the player's [[hunger bar]], compared to 0.2 exhaustion per jump. Therefore, walking up stairs doesn't make the player hungry at all.

=== Behavior ===
Generally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, [[Opacity|transparent]] blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces.

The full-block faces of stairs do block [[light]], and their non-full faces let light through the gaps.{{More info|Do stairs behave the same way in Bedrock Edition ?|bedrock=1}}
