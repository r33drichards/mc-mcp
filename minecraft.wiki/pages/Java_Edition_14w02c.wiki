== Trivia ==
* 14w02c was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* As with [[14w02a]] and [[14w02b]], this snapshot has the same protocol version as 1.7.6&ndash;1.7.10. Crossplay is therefore technically compatible between these versions but can cause issues.
