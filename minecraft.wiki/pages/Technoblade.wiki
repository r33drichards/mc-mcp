'''Alexander''' (June 1, 1999 – June 2022), better known by the moniker '''Technoblade''', was an American [[YouTube]]r known for his ''[[Minecraft]]'' videos, [[Wikipedia:Livestreaming|livestreams]], and involvement in the [[Wikipedia:Dream SMP|Dream SMP]]. His death in June 2022 prompted multiple official tributes in ''[[Minecraft]]'' and one in {{AMCM}}.

== Background ==
Technoblade registered his main channel on [[YouTube]] in 2013. His videos consisted primarily of ''Minecraft'' gameplay, particularly on the [[minigame]] server {{w|Hypixel}}. After rising to popularity in 2019 for his performances in [[Wikipedia:player versus player|PvP]] events, he became a notable member of the community. Technoblade was invited to the Dream SMP ''Minecraft'' server in 2020, further increasing his following. Some of his most viewed videos amassing over 20 million views, feature beating [[Hardcore mode]] using a steering wheel as an input and winning a self-hosted competition to obtain 500 million potatoes in the popular MMO [[Skyblock]] on the Hypixel server.

In August 2021, Technoblade announced his diagnosis with {{w|cancer}}. Following unsuccessful treatment attempts, Technoblade died from [[Wikipedia:Cancer staging#Overall stage grouping|metastatic]] [[Wikipedia:Sarcoma|sarcoma]] in June 2022. His father, known to the community as 'Technodad' posted a video in Technoblade's main Youtube channel titled "So long nerds," where Technodad was reading a letter Alex had written to his viewers a few hours before his death. Alex wanted his letter to be heard by his fans if he died, which was the unfortunate case. The announcement prompted widespread reactions across both the ''Minecraft'' and YouTube communities. At the time of his death, his main YouTube channel had reached nearly 11 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite |author=Toyin Owoseje |date=July 1, 2022 |title=Technoblade, Minecraft YouTuber watched by millions, dead at 23 |website=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/tech/technoblade-minecraft-youtuber-dead-int-scli/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220701164752/https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/tech/technoblade-minecraft-youtuber-dead-int-scli/index.html}}</ref>

== In the ''Minecraft'' franchise ==
On December 15, 2021, Minecraft reached a total of one trillion views on YouTube, leading to upload [[Minecraft Celebrates the Community! (Yes, that means you!)]] with Technoblade being a featured cameo, driving an invisible vehicle with a steering wheel.

=== Tributes ===
On July 1, 2022, following the announcement on June 30 that Technoblade had passed away, Mojang expressed their condolences.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1542917633242238976|We have been trying to find the words, but all of us here at Minecraft are heartbroken over the loss of Technoblade. He meant so much to our community and brought so much joy. He will be missed dearly. 🐷👑🗡️|July 1, 2022}}</ref> A day later, Mojang added his skin's crown to the [[pig]] on the ''Java Edition'' launcher image in memory of him.<ref>{{cite |author=Justin Reeve |date=July 2, 2022 |title=Mojang Mourns Technoblade By Featuring The YouTuber On The Minecraft Launcher |website=TheGamer |url=https://www.thegamer.com/mojang-mourns-technoblade-minecraft-launcher/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703035948/https://www.thegamer.com/mojang-mourns-technoblade-minecraft-launcher/}}</ref> The launcher art was changed one month later to reflect [[The Wild Update]], removing the pig and the crown from the launcher. After fans had suggested the addition, Mojang added a new [[splash text]], "Technoblade never dies!", to the ''Minecraft'' title screen in [[Java Edition 1.19.1|1.19.1]] in his honor. In an email to ''The New York Times'', Mojang Studios wrote that Technoblade "became synonymous with a source of good."<ref>{{Cite |author=Amanda Holpuch |date=July 19, 2022 |title=Mourning Technoblade: Fans Grieve a Minecraft Star They Never Met |website=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/technology/technoblade-minecraft-tributes.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220724095157/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/technology/technoblade-minecraft-tributes.html}}</ref>

Prior to the release of {{AMCM}}, it was revealed by Tommyinnit that there would be a Technoblade reference.<ref name=reference>{{tweet|technotwtnews|1906361515151610027|Tommyinnit confirmed on his stream that there is a Technoblade reference in A Minecraft Movie! 🐷👑|March 30, 2025}}</ref> In the film, a {{AMCM|pig}} wearing a golden crown with multi-colored gems in {{AMCM|Midport Village}}. {{AMCM|Steve}} refers to him as being a "legend" after {{AMCM|Henry}} asks if he is a king. Later in the year, Technoblade was featured in an [[How We Make Minecraft#How Players Changed the Game|episode]] of [[How We Make Minecraft]], given as an example of the community influencing the game, alongside others such as [[CaptainSparklez]] and the {{AMCM|Chicken Jockey sensation}}.
