|{{HistoryLine||v1.2.0|dev=preview|Nether portals have an unobtainable item form corresponding to its block ID. It can be obtained via inventory editors with numeric item ID 90.
|When placed, nether portal blocks are always in the east-west position. Further updates to the block result in instantaneous deletion.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.6|dev=Test Build 3|Nether portal items can be obtained from the newly added debug chests, mainly from the 5th slot of the 4th chest from the left, and the 16th slot of the 7th chest from the left.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=release|Debug chests no longer spawn, preventing Nether portal items from being obtained this way.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release 2 ;)|Added pick block functionality. This changes the currently selected slot to any containing a nether portal item, but does not allow it to be obtained if not already in the hotbar.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.2.5|dev=pre|Nether portal items can now be obtained via Pick Block in creative.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w16a|Nether portal items can now be obtained in singleplayer worlds via the {{cmd|give}} command using the respective numeric ID.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w17a|Nether portals can no longer be obtained with pick block in Creative.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w18a|Likely due to the server split in this version, nether portal blocks now take a frame to disappear when updated. As a result, when two nether portal blocks are placed next to each other horizontally with the item, they can be seen to connect.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w25a|The direct item form of Nether portals has been removed from the game. It can no longer exist as an item in any way, only as a placed block.}}
|{{HistoryLine|pocket alpha}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.12.1|dev=build 1|Nether portals have an unobtainable item form corresponding to its block ID. It can be obtained via inventory editors with numeric item ID 90.
|Nether portal blocks, when placed with this item, while always facing a single direction by default, would rotate accordingly if placed next to an existing nether portal block to connect with it.<ref>https://youtu.be/2UUX5gJdf2A?t=8m46s</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine|unknown}}
|{{HistoryLine||?|Nether portal blocks no longer align with other placed nether portal blocks and instantly disappear, unless the only surrounding blocks are nether portals, [[air]], and/or [[obsidian]].}}

|{{HistoryLine||v1.2.0|dev=preview|Nether portal items have an unstable item model that changes depending on blocks that are targeted or in loaded chunks. It uses this model in inventories, when held in first or third person view or as a dropped item.
|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE1.png|32px]] Initially the Nether portal item would appear as a full cube like many other blocks, but targeting an existing portal block would cause the item to morph into its shape: [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE1.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE1.png|32px]]
|Having an existing nether portal block within loaded chunks also appears to influence the shape of the nether portal item. For example, if no existing blocks are loaded, the item may appear in its full cube state, but loading a chunk containing an north-south oriented nether portal results in the item automatically becoming north-south.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.6|dev=Test Build 3|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE2.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE2.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE2.png|32px]] Block items have changed in this version to be brighter and rotated 90 degrees clockwise from their prior appearances. The "pane" appearance shapes can be seen to have been inverted as a result, with east-west oriented how north-south was previously and vice versa.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE3.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE3.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE3.png|32px]] Block items are now far brighter than before.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=RC2|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE4.png|32px]] Block items are now more shaded again.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w22a|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE5.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE5.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE5.png|32px]] Most 3D items in the inventory have been rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4.2|dev=12w34a|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE6.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE6.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE6.png|32px]] Items appeared slightly darker in the player's inventory than in chests prior to this version.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w37b|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (unconnected) JE1.png|32px]]  With the addition of post-shaped nether portals, the item can take on this shape as well.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w42a|[[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (unconnected) JE2.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NS) JE7.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (EW) JE7.png|32px]] [[File:Nether Portal (inventory) (NESW) JE7.png|32px]] Nether portal items now appear translucent in the inventory. As a dropped item, in a player's hand, or in an item frame, they still appear opaque.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w42b|Nether portal items now appear translucent when dropped or in an item frame.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.4|dev=13w47a|Nether portal items now appear translucent when held, in both first person and third person.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w18a|[[File:Nether Portal (texture) JE2-a1.png|32px]] The Nether portal item form is now 2D.}}
|{{HistoryLine|bedrock}}
|{{HistoryLine||?|[[File:Invicon Nether Portal.gif|32px]] The nether portal item looks like this, and does not shapeshift in response to existing blocks. However, if it is updated, it breaks.}}
