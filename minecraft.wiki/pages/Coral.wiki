'''Coral''' is a type of non-solid block that comes in five variants: tube, brain, bubble, fire, and horn.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
[[File:Sea pickles on coral.png|thumb|right|Coral generated in [[warm ocean]]s.]]
Coral can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] by hand, but can be obtained only when mined with a [[Silk Touch]] enchanted tool. Mining coral does not decrease the Silk Touch tool's [[durability]].
{{breaking row|Coral|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Coral naturally generates in [[coral reef]] structures found in [[warm ocean]] biomes.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
When using [[bone meal]] on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[gravel]], or [[clay]] in [[warm ocean]] biomes, coral generates in place of some of the [[seagrass]] in a 5×5 area. {{IN|be}}, the same can happen in any biome as long as bone meal is used in a water source above the aforementioned solid blocks.

== Usage ==
Coral can be used as a building or decoration block.

=== Placement ===
In order for coral to stay alive, at least one of the blocks surrounding it must be [[water]] or a [[waterlogging|waterlogged block]]. If placed outside of water, it dies and transforms into its respective [[dead coral]] after 3 to 4.95 seconds{{only|JE}} or 2 to 9.95 seconds{{only|BE}}. Coral dies even when the [[game rule]] {{cd|randomTickSpeed}} is set to {{cd|0}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-129942|||Invalid}}</ref> Once a coral turns into its dead variant, it is not possible to turn it back into a live variant.

=== Note Blocks ===
All types of coral can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
