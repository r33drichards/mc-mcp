The '''Oxeye cape''' was a personal [[cape]] based on [http://www.oxeyegames.com/ Oxeye Game Studio], a game development company co-founded by [[Jens Bergensten]] and authors of games such as ''[[Mojang_Studios#Cobalt|Cobalt]].'' Its existence was revealed when it was randomly given to a player.

== Appearance ==
The cape's design mimics  the logo of the aforementioned studio: a black background with a circular white center.

== Distribution ==
This cape was randomly given to the player iSxckk, presumably by accident, then removed the next day.
