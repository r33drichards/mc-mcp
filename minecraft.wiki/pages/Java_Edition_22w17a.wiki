'''22w17a''' is the eighth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on April 27, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w17a|April 27, 2022}}</ref> which adds [[goat horn]]s from {{BE}}, makes changes to [[allay]]s and [[warden]]s, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Goat Horn JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Goat horn]]'''
* Added from {{BE}}.
* Drops when a [[goat]] rams [[coal ore]], [[emerald ore]], [[iron ore]], [[log]], [[packed ice]], or [[stone]].
* Can play a loud sound that can be heard from afar, with a cooldown around 7 seconds between each use.
* Has 8 variants, each variant has its own unique sound.
** "Ponder", "Sing", "Seek", "Feel" can be obtained from the regular goats' ramming, or the [[chest]] in [[pillager outpost]]s with a 50% chance.
** "Admire", "Call", "Yearn", "Dream" can only be obtained from the screaming goats' ramming.
** The variant of horn that a goat may drop is completely random.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Added new death messages to [[warden]]s' ranged attack:
** "<''player''> was obliterated by a sonically-charged shriek"
** If a player or mob attacks the dead player before they die, the death message is "<''player''> was obliterated by a sonically-charged shriek whilst trying to escape <''player''/''mob''>".

=== General ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Chat messages between players are now cryptographically signed.
* Players are given a Mojang provided key-pair on startup.
* Chat styling is now handled via server resource packs with the translation key <code>chat.type.text</code>.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* Added {{nbt|byte|HasLeftHorn}} and {{nbt|byte|HasRightHorn}} boolean fields to goats' entity format.
** Decides the visibility and dropability of their horns.

'''[[Item modifier]]'''
* Added the item function <code>set_goat_horn_sound</code>.

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Added server property <code>enforce-secure-profile</code> to allow servers to requiring a player to having a Mojang-signed public key.
** Defaults to <code>false</code>.
** Enforcing secure profiles prevents players without a Mojang-signed public key from connecting.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the following block tags:
** <code>#overworld_natural_logs</code>: {{cd|d=and|acacia_log|birch_log|oak_log|jungle_log|spruce_log|dark_oak_log|mangrove_log}}.
** <code>#snaps_goat_horn</code>: {{cd|d=and|#overworld_natural_logs|stone|packed_ice|iron_ore|coal_ore|emerald_ore}}.
* Added the following item tag:
** <code>#overworld_natural_logs</code>: {{cd|d=and|acacia_log|birch_log|oak_log|jungle_log|spruce_log|dark_oak_log|mangrove_log}}.
* Added the following game event tag:
** <code>#allay_can_listen</code>: <code>note_block_play</code>
