{{Removed feature|edition=je}}
[[File:Super Secret Settings.png|thumb|The "Super Secret Settings..." button]]
'''Super Secret Settings''' was a button in the [[options]] menu that enabled built-in post-processing [[shader]]s.

When clicking on the button, a random sound played with a very low pitch, and the game cycled to the next shader. Once the last shader was reached, the game cycled back to the default shader <code>blit</code> which did not have any effect. The currently enabled shader was shown in the [[debug screen]] and could be toggled on and off by pressing {{key|F4}}.

This option was removed from the game in [[Java Edition 15w31a]], two years after its addition. The underlying shaders remained unused up to their removal in [[Java Edition 24w11a]].

== List of shaders ==
Note that the differences between certain shaders can be subtle, and therefore, to notice the differences, it might be necessary to observe a picture with higher resolution by clicking on the provided sample images.

! Name
! Description
! Sample Images
|-
| Default (Blit)
| This does not utilize shaders.<br />Use as a baseline for comparing to the screenshots below.
| [[File:Shader none.png|475px]]
|-
| Notch
| Uses 8-bit color with half the resolution, with a dithering effect.<br />This is a reference to how many of Notch's other games use a similar overlay.
| [[File:Shader notch.png|475px]]
|-
| FXAA
| This shader adds a small amount of anti-aliasing (smoothing jagged edges), most visible in trees along the horizon.
| [[File:Shader fxaa.png|475px]]
|-
| Art
| Pixels are blurred outward, causing moving objects to twinkle.
| [[File:Shader art.png|475px]]
|-
| Bumpy
| Outlines color differences, and gives textures a 3D look.<br />More visible when viewing screenshot at full resolution.
| [[File:Shader bumpy.png|475px]]
|-
| Blobs2
| Similar to Art, but less graphically intensive.
| [[File:Shader blobs2.png|475px]]
|-
| Pencil
| Monochromatic and sometimes has outlines.
| [[File:Shader pencil.png|475px]]
|-
| Color convolve
| Intensifies/adds more colors, adding vibrancy.
| [[File:Shader color convolve.png|475px]]
|-
| Deconverge
| Offsets the red, green, and blue color channels.
| [[File:Shader deconverge.png|475px]]
|-
| Flip
| Flips the player's view vertically.
| [[File:Shader flip.png|475px]]
|-
| Invert
| Inverts and slightly desaturates colors.<br />Used when viewing the world as an [[enderman]] in [[Spectator]] mode.
| [[File:Shader invert.png|475px]]
|-
| NTSC
| Gives the player's view the impression of a CRT monitor or television screen.
| [[File:Shader ntsc.png|475px]]
|-
| Outline
| Outlines color differences similarly to Bumpy, but less complex.<br />Has no effect on some computers.
| [[File:Shader outline.png|475px]]
|-
| Phosphor
| Pixels on screen linger, being "dragged out" when in motion before fading away.
| [[File:Shader phosphor.png|475px]]
|-
| Scan pincushion
| Similar to NTSC, but without the blurring and much less graphically intensive.
| [[File:Shader scan pincushion.png|475px]]
|-
| Sobel
| Turns the view black except for the edges of textures.
| [[File:Shader sobel.png|475px]]
|-
| Bits
| Lowers the resolution and uses an 8-bit color scheme.
| [[File:Shader bits.png|475px]]
|-
| Desaturate
| Reduces intensity of colors drastically, causing, as the name suggests, a desaturated effect.
| [[File:Shader desaturate.png|475px]]
|-
| Green
| Scan Pincushion and Bits, but with a green overlay.
| [[File:Shader green.png|475px]]
|-
| Blur
| Blurs the screen overall, independent of what is being displayed.{{info needed|Is this the same shader used in 24w09a and onwards in menus? Also, is this linear blur or box blur?}}
| [[File:Shader blur.png|475px]]
|-
| Wobble
| Colors cycle through the hue range constantly.<br />All displayed pixels move up and down via a sine calculation.<br />This affects only the screen plane and not the vertices being displayed by it;<br />observing the edge of the screen reveals the pixels being moved.
| [[File:Shader wobble.png|475px]]
|-
| Blobs
| Similar to Blobs2 and Art, but the spots are tiny when close up and big when far away.
| [[File:Shader blobs.png|475px]]
|-
| Antialias
| Blurs the edges of pixels to reduce jaggedness.<br />This is blurrier than FXAA, but is better at eliminating jagged edges in textures and blocks.
| [[File:Shader antialias.png|475px]]
|-
| Creeper
| Similar to Green, but with no black borders and with a higher but still reduced resolution.<br />Used when viewing the world as a [[creeper]] in Spectator mode.
| [[File:Shader creeper.png|475px]]
|-
| Spider
| 8 "eyes" onscreen with blur in between, similar to a spider's face.<br />Used when viewing the world as a [[spider]] or [[cave spider]] in Spectator mode.
| [[File:Shader spider.png|475px]]

== Passes ==
The shaders consisted of different passes. Each super secret shader used one or multiple of these passes, and consisted of a fragment shader and a vertex shader.
