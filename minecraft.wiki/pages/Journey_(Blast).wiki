The '''Journey''' screen consists of all the chapters that can be found within ''[[Minecraft Blast]]''. Completing levels allows the player to make the progress bar go up in each chapter of the journey screen. Completing a chapter replaces the progress bar with a checkmark. All the chapters are connected with a path starting off with chapter 1, chapter 3 is followed by group of black stones.

Viewing the journey screen shows the game in an isometric view.  As of now the journey screen only allows the player to check what chapter has been completed and doesn't allow previous levels or chapters to be replayed.

When first starting off in chapter 1, the journey screen is all locked except for the chapter the player is currently on, as the game progresses and more levels are completed, sections of the journey will be unlocked, and more mobs and blocks will be added. When completing chapter 3, not only does the chapter 3 get a checkmark but chapter 4 as well.
