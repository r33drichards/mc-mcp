'''Tricky Trials Update Official Trailer''' is a trailer made to promote the update of the same name, telling a story involving [[Sunny]] becoming separated from the rest of the ''Minecraft'' gang in the [[Trial Chambers|trial chambers]].

== Summary ==
The trailer opens on a closeup of [[Steve]] in media res, surrounded by various monsters in a trial chamber. Several [[Zombie|zombies]] try to overwhelm them, while [[bogged]] shoot from afar, before an explosion occurs behind everyone and the camera reveals the huge mass of the chambers. The scene changes to Steve, [[Alex]], Sunny, [[Efe]], [[Makena]], [[Kai]], and several [[Wolf|wolves]] camping outside of an eroded chamber. Alex is forging useful items using several [[Crafter|crafters]], handing Kai an [[Iron Axe|iron axe]] and Sunny a [[crossbow]]. The group cautiously roam the chamber, Kai using the axe to clean a [[Copper Bulb|copper bulb]], before accidentally setting off a [[tripwire]].

After surviving the trap, the gang emerges in a chamber filled with bogged, who [[poison]] Kai, who in turn accidentally pushes Sunny off the platform into [[Powder Snow|powder snow]]. Sunny looks up as the gang continues to traverse the path, deciding to go a different route to catch up with them, finding them high above on a catwalk. However, Sunny is ambushed by a group of bogged, using a [[Golden Apple|golden apple]] to overpower them. At the end of a hallway, Sunny walks in on an in-progress fight between the cast and several [[Breeze|breezes]]. Pulling out a [[Firework Rocket|firework rocket]], Sunny tries to help Steve evade the zombies, before a wind burst redirects it, causing the explosion at the beginning.

Recognizing the mistake, Sunny begins shooting every other monster in the room with regular [[Arrow|arrows]], helping Steve and Kai escape before they fight a breeze. Efe throws a [[Splash Potion|splash potion]], while Kai uppercuts a spider with the axe. The trial completed, Efe claims several [[Trial Key|trial keys]], before Steve claims their loot from a [[vault]].

In a stinger, the established group are munching on cookies by a campfire, while [[Ari]], [[Zuri]], and [[Noor]] begin their own trip into the chamber, as Alex waves to them. Steve then shows off a newly crafted [[mace]].

=== Errors ===

* The trial keys dispensed by the [[Trial Spawner|trial spawner]] use the old in-game texture from pre-[[Java Edition 24w05a|snapshot 24w05a]] or [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.20.70.21|Preview 1.20.70.21]], and do not conform to the minimalist style featured in the rest of the video.
* Sunny is able to avoid being frozen in powder snow, despite only wearing an [[Iron Chestplate|iron chestplate]] and no [[leather armor]].
* Sunny is able to fire multiple arrows from a crossbow in a short amount of time even though it is not enchanted with [[quick charge]].
