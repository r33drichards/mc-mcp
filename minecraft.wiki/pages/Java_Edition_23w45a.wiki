== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the [[Update 1.21]] experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Trial Spawner JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Trial spawner]]'''
* A block similar to [[monster spawner]]s that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer.
* The challenge level increases for each new player a trial spawner notices nearby.
** Challenge level doesn't decrease until it is reset during a trial spawner's cooldown.
* Unlike normal spawners, a trial spawner spawns a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level.
** It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight.
** It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has.
** Spawned mobs are persistent and don't despawn.
* Once all mobs are defeated, the trial spawner ejects a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level.
** After the rewards have been ejected, the trial spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it no longer spawns mobs.
* Can't be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout [[trial chambers]].
* Extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and don't drop even with [[Silk Touch]].
* When placed in Creative, trial spawners have no mob type set by default.
** The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a spawn egg.
* Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by trial spawners.

==== Items ====
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Breeze Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Breeze spawn egg]]

'''[[File:Trial Key JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Trial key]]'''
* An item that can only be obtained from trial spawners.
* Currently doesn't have any functionality.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[File:Breeze JE1.png|32px]] [[Breeze]]'''
* The breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via trial spawner in some rooms within the trial chambers.
* Has {{hp|30}} health points.
* Cannot be hit by [[arrow]]s or [[trident]]s.
* The breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances.
* An aggressive adversary, the breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target.
* Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity.
* After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks.
* Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
** Non-iron doors and trapdoors are flipped.
** Fence gates are flipped.
** Buttons are pressed.
** Levers are flipped.
** Bells are rung and swung.
** Lit candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished.
* Wind bursts do not have any effect on iron doors, iron trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a redstone signal.
* Currently does not drop any loot.

==== Non-mob entities ====
'''[[File:Wind Charge JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Wind charge]]'''
* Fired by the [[breeze]].
* Explodes upon impact, emitting a large burst of plume particles and [[Knockback (mechanic)|knocking]] entities back similar to a TNT explosion.
* Its explosion interacts with certain blocks, including [[button]]s and [[trapdoor]]s.
* Deals damage when colliding directly with a player or mob.
* Can be deflected, just like [[fireball]]s.

==== World generation ====
'''{{EnvLink|Trial chambers}}'''
* A new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game.
** Made out of a variety of copper and tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small.
** Relatively common throughout the deepslate layer of the underground, with the starting piece generating at a height between <code>-40</code> and <code>-20</code>.
* The layout of each trial chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, supply and reward chests, decorated pots, and a variety of combat spaces.
** Traps include dispensers containing different potential items, such as [[arrow]]s or [[fire charge]]s.
** Supply chests can be found between the different rooms, and give the player blocks and items which help them navigate their trials.
** Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment.
** Decorated pots found in hallways can contain supplies such as iron or arrows. Some pots are decorated and others are blank.
** The loot found in reward chests and decorated pots are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final as well as the loot from defeating mobs from a trial spawner.
* Each trial chamber can include trial spawners from three categories:
** Melee: zombie, husk or slime.
** Small melee: spider, cave spider, baby zombie or silverfish.
** Ranged: skeleton, stray, or skeleton with arrows of Poison.
* Each trial spawner category only uses one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each trial chamber.
** For example, one trial chamber might only spawn zombies, cave spiders and strays, while another might only spawn slimes, silverfish and skeletons.
** The exceptions to this are some trial spawners in unique rooms which always spawn breezes.
* Regular mob spawning does not happen inside the bounding boxes of the trial chamber pieces.

==== General ====
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added following damage type tag:
** <code>#breeze_immune_to</code>: contains <code>arrow</code> and <code>trident</code>.
* Added following entity type tags:
** <code>#deflects_arrows</code>: contains <code>breeze</code>.
** <code>#deflects_tridents</code>: contains <code>breeze</code>.
* Added following biome tag:
** <code>#has_structure/trial_chambers</code>: contains <code>#is_overworld</code>.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Copper grate]]s'''
* Now prevent mob spawning on top of them.
* No longer suffocate mobs who end up with their head inside them.

==== General ====
'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* Added entity models and textures for experimental breeze mob:
** <code>breeze</code>, <code>wind_charge</code>.
* Added shader:
** <code>breeze_wind</code>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>breeze</code> into <code>#fall_damage_immune</code> entity type tag.

== Trivia ==
* This snapshot is one of only three snapshots for {{JE}} to have its digits consecutively increasing by one. The only other snapshots to have this property are [[Java Edition 12w34a|12w34a]] and [[Java Edition 12w34b|12w34b]]. As there can only be 53 weeks in a year, and because the snapshot format changed beginning with [[Java Edition 26.1 Snapshot 1|26.1 Snapshot 1]], this is also the final one.
