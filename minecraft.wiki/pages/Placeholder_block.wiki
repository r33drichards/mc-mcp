Multiple blocks can be referred to as '''placeholder blocks''':
* {{BlockLink|id=client-request-placeholder-block|client_request_placeholder_block}}
* {{BlockLink|info_update}}
* {{BlockLink|info_update2}}
* {{BlockLink|reserved6}}
* {{BlockLink|unknown-block|unknown}}

While not a block in itself, the [[missing model]] [[File:Missing Model (inventory) JE1.png|32px]] is also a type of placeholder, due to being used for handling undefined or flawed model data.
