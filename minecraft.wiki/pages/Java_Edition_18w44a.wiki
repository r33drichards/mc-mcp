=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''

* "Two by Two"
** Requirements have been changed from ocelots to cats.
** Now requires [[panda]]s.

'''[[Commands]]'''
* Removed <code>award</code> part of {{cmd|drop}} command (<code>loot</code> now does the same thing)

'''Conditions'''
* <code>entity_properties</code>
** Now uses same predicate syntax as advancements (like <code>player_killed_entity</code>). 
** Parameters are now described in <code>predicate</code> field. If this field is an empty object, any entity is accepted (but still has to be present).

'''[[Function (Java Edition)|Function]]s'''
* <code>set_name</code>
** Added new parameter <code>entity</code> (same values as <code>entity_present</code> condition). If present, the name is resolved with that entity (which allows using selector and score components).
* <code>fill_player_head</code>
** Copies player profile info to player head item.
** Parameters:
*** <code>entity</code> – source of profile (same values as <code>entity_present</code> condition, does nothing if it's not player).
* <code>set_lore</code>
** Adds or replaces lore lines.
** Parameters:
*** <code>lore</code> – list of lines (in chat component format) to be added.
*** <code>replace</code> – if true, previous lore is erased.
*** <code>entity</code> – if present, name is resolved with selected entity (same values as <code>entity_present</code> condition).

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* New loot table functions: <code>set_lore</code> and <code>fill_player_head</code>.
* Removed loot table condition: <code>entity_present</code>.
* New loot table conditions: {{code|delimiter=,|damage_source_properties|location_check|weather_check}} and two special modifiers: <code>inverted</code> and <code>alternative</code>.
* Renamed entity parameter in predicates from <code>direct_killer_entity</code> to <code>direct_killer</code>.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Block variant <code>{"nbt": ''path'', "block": "''coordinates''"} </code>, where <code>''coordinates''</code> field uses same format as {{cmd|setblock}}.
* Entity variant <code>{"nbt": ''path'', "entity": ''selector''} </code>, where <code>''selector''</code> field uses same format as {{cmd|kill}}.
* Additionally, if field <code>interpret</code> is present and set to <code>true</code>, contents of selected tags are interpreted as chat components.
* Works same as selector components:
** If there are no elements, returns empty string.
** If there are multiple elements, merges them with <code>,</code>.

'''Video settings'''
* Removed option to disable [[wikipedia:Vertex buffer object|VBOs]] in the game settings. VBOs are now always used.
