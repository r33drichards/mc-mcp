A '''stray''' is a [[skeleton]] variant that spawns in various snow-covered [[biome]]s. They behave very similarly to skeletons, except they fire [[tipped arrow]]s of [[Slowness]] from their [[bow]]s and do not freeze in [[powder snow]].

== Spawning ==
A stray may spawn directly under the sky in [[snowy plains]], or [[ice spikes]], replacing 80% of skeletons. Additionally, a stray may spawn in [[Frozen River|frozen rivers]], [[frozen ocean]]s, [[deep frozen ocean]]s, [[legacy frozen ocean]]s, [[snowy slopes]], [[jagged peaks]] and [[frozen peaks]] in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''. Strays do not spawn naturally from [[monster spawner]]s {{in|java}}.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Converting ===
When a [[skeleton]] is kept inside [[powder snow]] for {{convert|7|second|game tick}}, it begins shaking. After another {{convert|15|second|game tick}}, it becomes a stray. A converted stray appears with full health even if the original skeleton did not have full health. Items being held or worn by a skeleton when it becomes a stray remain unchanged. Unlike regular skeletons, [[bogged]] and [[parched]] do not turn into strays, but take freezing damage instead.

=== Trial spawners ===
Strays have a {{frac|1|3}} chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].

=== Spider jockeys ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}[[Spider]]s and [[cave spiders]] spawned in biomes where strays can spawn (spiders cannot naturally spawn in [[snowy plains]]) have a 1% chance to spawn as a [[spider jockey]], with an 80% chance of the rider being a stray. {{IN|je}}, stray spider jockeys cannot spawn naturally, but the skeleton rider can convert into a stray and continue as a stray spider jockey.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Bone|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Arrow|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Arrow of Slowness|notes=player|quantity=0-1|lootingquantity=0-1|limit=1}}
}}
* Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up. 
* Any naturally spawned equipment, including the [[bow]], has an 8.5% chance of dropping (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It is damaged and may be enchanted. 
* {{xp|5}} [[experience]] orbs when killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]] and an extra {{xp|1|3}} if the stray has [[armor]].

== Behavior ==
Strays behave the same as normal skeletons but make noises with an echoing effect and shoot [[tipped arrow]]s that inflict [[Slowness]] for 30 seconds on any target that they hit. {{iN|be}}, strays that are underwater use a melee attack that inflicts Slowness. Strays do not take damage from freezing in powder snow, but they are not immune to Slowness. A stray holding a [[tipped arrow]] or [[spectral arrow]] in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow instead, and the arrow held is not consumed.

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* Unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

As they are also under the "skeletons" [[entity type tag]], if a stray kills a [[creeper]], the creeper drops a [[music disc]], randomly selected from [[Music Disc 13|13]], [[Music Disc cat|cat]], [[Music Disc blocks|blocks]], [[Music Disc chirp|chirp]], [[Music Disc far|far]], [[Music Disc mall|mall]], [[Music Disc mellohi|mellohi]], [[Music Disc stal|stal]], [[Music Disc strad|strad]], [[Music Disc ward|ward]], [[Music Disc 11|11]], and [[Music Disc wait|wait]].

Like [[bogged]] and [[parched]], the eyes of strays are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]].

== Trivia ==
*Strays and other skeleton variants do not know how to use a [[crossbow]], despite the same using method as a [[bow]].
*According to the ''[[Minecraft]]'' website, the slowness arrows represent frozen arrows that freeze on impact.<ref name=":0" />
*The stray's fourth ambient sound is the skeleton's second ambient sound but partly edited.
