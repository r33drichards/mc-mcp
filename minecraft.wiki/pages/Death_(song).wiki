'''"Death"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that appears only on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]'', and is the shortest track on the album.

== Track description ==
"Death" is composed of a piano piece that plays in tangent with sound effects. At the beginning, a player can be heard traversing during the night, as watery sounds are made. As the player approaches, a [[chicken]] is heard clucking. The player then charges their [[bow]] at the chicken and shoots, killing the chicken. Quickly, the player runs to grab their drop.

== Trivia ==
* While "Death" uses ''[[Minecraft]]'' sound effects, most of the sounds featured are original and did not appear in the game when the album was released.
