'''Buried treasure''' is a naturally generated [[structure]] that consists of a buried loot [[chest]]. The chest is buried primarily in [[beach]]es, and rarely in the [[ocean]] floor. Buried treasure is the only source of the [[heart of the sea]], which can be used to craft a [[conduit]]. Buried treasure can be located using [[explorer map]]s.

== Generation ==
Buried treasures generate in beach biomes, and can also generate underwater.

The treasure [[chest]] is almost always buried by some material. Most of the time the chest generates buried in a beach, so it has a [[sand]] or [[gravel]] block covering it. Sometimes, if generated on the side of an underwater hill, it spawns with [[stone]] blocks covering it. If it generates on the surface of the ocean floor, a [[gravel]] or [[sand]] block covers it. Nonetheless, terrain generation can cause the [[chest]] to be buried by any suitable terrain-generated blocks, such as [[coal ore]] and [[diorite]].

{{IN|java}}, buried treasure always generates at [[chunk]] coordinate 9 (out of 0 through 15) on both the X and Z axis<ref>{{bug|MC-227443}}</ref>, and are always facing east.

{{IN|bedrock}}, buried treasure always generates at [[chunk]] coordinate 8 (out of 0 through 15) on the X and Z axis.

== Structure ==
Buried treasures contain a single chest full of various loot. If the chest is exposed to water, it generates [[Waterlogging|waterlogged]].

== Loot ==
{{see also|Chest loot}}
A [[heart of the sea]] is always present in every buried treasure.

== Trivia ==
* Buried treasures are the smallest naturally generated structure in the game.
* In ''Java Edition'', the player arrow is shown under the X of the treasure, but in ''Bedrock Edition'', the player arrow is shown on top of the X.
* In ''Java Edition'', the buried treasure contains the highest number of diamonds per chest among all structures, at an average of 1.25 diamonds per chest, while the end city only has an average of 1.06 diamonds per chest.
