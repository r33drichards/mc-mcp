'''[https://web.archive.org/web/20210225150436/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/112481256/multiplayer-kd-trees-and-water Word of Notch post]''', '''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYwL6l_5lfM YouTube video (reupload)]''', '''[https://ia903208.us.archive.org/12/items/Rotab-Minecraft-IRC-logs/%23minecraft.20090526.log Rotab's IRC logs, May 26th, 2009]'''

* '''Blocks'''
** Water
*** Now flows faster than before.
*** Now flows from world border.
*** The player can now select and build with water.<ref>[[#5/26 logs|May 26 IRC logs]]: "(15:45:28) <taodih> notch will we be able to use water as block? [...] (15:45:35) <taodih> in build mode? [...] (15:46:45) <@Notch> taodih: I already can in 0.0.14, but it's DANGEROUS"</ref>
**** Was disabled in the final release.

== Offset test (May 25, 2009) ==
'''[https://web.archive.org/web/20210224102046/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/112901181/playing-around-with-random-offsets-per-request Word of Notch post]''', '''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj4eZcldAEo YouTube video (reupload)]'''
* '''General'''
** Online level saving re-enabled.
** Reverted the grass texture back to the original. 
* '''Blocks'''
** Vertex and color offset tests.
*** Vertex offsets cause "wavy" blocks, making the world look more realistic.
*** Color offsets cause every block to be a slightly different color.
**** Was later removed as Notch didn't like the idea.

== Trivia ==
* Respawning when pressing {{key|R}} worked just like in 0.0.13a_03 and prior, as this was not changed until the public release of 0.0.14a. 
* The mouse features (auto breaking/building when left-click is held down, scroll-wheel block picking support and pick-block with middle mouse button) were all added on May 27, 2009 for the full release of 0.0.14a.
