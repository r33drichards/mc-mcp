* The book claims [[witch]]es were added in Alpha 1.4.2, a version that does not exist. Witches were added in the full release version of [[Java Edition 1.4.2|1.4.2]].
* The book claims you can mine [[redstone ore]] with a [[golden pickaxe]] to obtain [[redstone dust]]. Mining redstone ore with a golden pickaxe will not drop anything.
