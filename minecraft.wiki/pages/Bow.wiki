A '''bow''' is a [[Ranged attack|ranged]] [[weapon]] that can fire [[arrow]]s and arrow variants. The damage and range of fired arrows depends on how long the {{Control|use|text=use button}} was held before releasing.

=== Mob loot ===
==== Skeletons, strays, bogged and illusioners ====
[[Skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]] and [[illusioner]]s{{only|je|short=1}} have an 8.5% chance of dropping a normal or enchanted bow on death when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]].

The chance of dropping a bow is increased by 1% per level of [[Looting]], allowing up to an 11.5% chance of dropping. 

The chance of being enchanted depends on the [[difficulty]] level, but the random enchantment level (5–22) does not. 

Bows of [[skeleton horsemen]] are always enchanted at a random level from 5 to 23. The exact level depends on [[regional difficulty]], as on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

===Fishing===
{{Main|Fishing}}
Enchanted bows are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt. See [[fishing]] for more details.  When caught, the bow may be damaged and contain random [[enchantment]]s equivalent to a level 30 enchantment from an [[enchanting table]], including treasure enchantments like [[Mending]].

== Usage ==
[[File:Steve aiming with Bow.png|150px|right]]
[[File:Alex aiming with Bow.png|150px|right]]
Bows can be drawn back by {{control|using}} them. The player must have at least one [[arrow]] in their [[inventory]] or be in [[Creative]] mode in order to use a bow. When drawing a bow, the display zooms in slightly. Charging the bow to critical charge causes it to visually bob up and down, and causes the fired arrow to have a trail of critical hit [[particle]]s. Releasing the button shoots an [[arrow]]. Drawing a bow can be canceled by switching to another hotbar slot while holding use. Arrows shot by bows are blocked by shields.

[[File:Bow shooting.gif|thumb|right|Shooting a bow {{in|java}}.]]

While the bow is being charged or remains fully charged, the player is forced to move at [[sneaking]] speed, unless they are riding a [[horse]], [[minecart]] or [[boat]], or flying with [[elytra]]. When an arrow hits another player, the player that fired the arrow will hear a high-pitched "ding" sound to indicate the successful shot.{{only|je}} Fired arrows are not affected by the [[Strength]] or [[Weakness]] effects.

Shots at critical charge deal <math display="inline">\left ( \frac{3x}{2} \right ) + 2</math> damage, where <math>x</math> is the damage after any enchantments. The listed values below describe maximum damage from a bow with no [[Power]] enchantments, assuming the target is at a distance where drag and gravity are negligible. The average damage of a shot at critical charge is around 9, as damage is dealt at a random value between {{hp|6}} and {{hp|11}}, using the formula <math>x</math> and <math display="inline">\left ( \frac{3x}{2} \right ) + 2</math>, and it is rare to have minimum or maximum values. The damage dealt can ultimately be less than the maximum damage if the arrow slows down after being shot. The game stores the damage of arrows even in values with a decimal point. For example, it is possible for a critical arrow shot to cause damage values such as 6.4. In this case, the game can round up or down and store the amount for subsequent damage sources. Holding the bow at maximum charge for more than 72000 ticks (1 hour) results in the charge being reset without shooting an arrow.

A few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. This includes:
* [[Endermen]] - even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows;
* [[Breeze]];
* [[Wither]] under half health, when it gains wither armor;
* Closed [[shulker]]s;
* [[Ender dragon]], while sitting on top of the [[exit portal]].

A bow can be combined with another bow in an [[anvil]], preserving the [[enchantment]]s of both.

=== Enchantments ===
Bows can receive several different [[enchantment]]s and have a base enchantability of 1. Bow enchantments have no effect on [[arrow]] speed or the distance it travels. {{IN|BE}} if a bow is enchanted with any level 1 enchantment, it always gets Power I.

A bow cannot be enchanted with Multishot in survival mode. However, when using commands to apply Multishot, the enchantment behaves as expected, allowing the bow to fire more arrows at once.{{Notelist}}

=== Fuel ===
A bow can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per bow {{in|java}} or 1 item per bow {{in|bedrock}}.

== Arrows ==
{{main|Arrow}}

As in real life, a flying [[arrow]] in ''Minecraft'' is affected by gravity. Its vertical speed is modified by one block downward every second, resulting in a {{w|Parabola|parabolic}} flight path. An arrow slows down if shot through water, reducing its damage to near zero unless brought back into the air or otherwise given momentum.{{Only|Java}}

Arrows that hit solid [[block]]s become stuck and can be retrieved, unless the arrow was shot by a bow [[enchant]]ed with [[Infinity]], a player in Creative mode, or a mob.

An arrow shot through [[lava]] ignites, giving it the effect of the [[Flame]] enchantment, igniting any entity it hits. If not extinguished, the fire inflicts up to {{hp|4}} damage. Although a [[wither skeleton]] does not spawn naturally with a bow, it shoots flaming arrows if given a bow using commands.

On impact, an arrow can trigger a wooden [[pressure plate]], [[target]] block, [[wooden button]], or [[tripwire]]. Arrows cannot trigger stone pressure plates or stone buttons.

The player can choose the type of arrow to shoot based on its location in the inventory. Arrows in the off-hand, or the selected hotbar slot if the bow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first. If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot then the arrow closest to [[Inventory#Slots|slot 0]] is selected.

|{{HistoryLine||4|Bow [[inaccuracy]] has been lessened from 1 to 0.25, increasing the accuracy of fired arrows.}}
|{{HistoryLine||6|Bows now increase [[inaccuracy]] and lose [[critical charge]] if held drawn for longer than 3 seconds, a mechanic called bow fatigue. This is visually indicated by the bow beginning to shake more violently after 3 seconds.<ref group="note"> The formula for fatigue is <math>\min(10.5,\max(0.5,0.5+\frac{10\times(ticksCharged-60)}{140}))</math></ref>|Vertical momentum no longer influences the flight path of arrows fired from crossbows.}}
|{{HistoryLine||7c|Bow fatigue has been removed.}}
|{{HistoryLine||8b|Bow fatigue has been reintroduced once again.}}
