A '''blast furnace''' is a [[block]] that [[smelt]]s ores, raw metals, and metal [[armor]] and [[tool]]s twice as quickly as a [[furnace]], but cannot use [[Smelting#Recipes|smelting recipes]] or [[Cooked food|cook food]]. It also serves as an [[armorer]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A blast furnace can be picked up using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it does not drop itself.

Blast furnaces drop their contents when broken.

=== Natural generation ===
Blast furnaces can generate in any armorer house; these can be found in a [[village]]. Blast furnaces can also generate in [[trail ruins]].

== Usage ==
Blast furnaces can be pushed by [[piston]]s.{{only|bedrock}}

=== Smelting ===
[[File:Blast Furnace GUI.png|thumb|176px|The GUI for the blast furnace, same as the ordinary furnace's.]]
{{main|Smelting}}

Blast furnaces are similar to furnaces, but can [[smelt]] only [[raw metal]], [[ore]] blocks and [[tool]]s/[[armor]] made of [[iron]], [[gold]], [[chainmail]], or [[copper]]. Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to [[smoker]]s, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron, gold or copper nugget from their respective materials. Once an [[item]] and a [[fuel]] are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to <code>lit</code> and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace. Fuel is also used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items smelted per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by {{control|using}} the output. Like normal [[furnace]]s, a [[hopper]] can be used to feed items into or collect items from a blast furnace.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a blast furnace has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to armorer and claim the blast furnace as their [[job site block]].

=== Light source ===
Blast furnaces emit a [[light]] level of 13 when active, similar to normal [[furnace]]s.

=== Custom name ===
By default, the interface of a blast furnace is labeled "Blast Furnace", but this name can be customized by naming it in an [[anvil]] before placing it, or by changing the <code>CustomName</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command.{{only|java}}

=== Lock ===
{{IN|je}}, a blast furnace can be "locked" by setting its <code>lock</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command. If a blast furnace's <code>lock</code> tag is not blank, the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the <code>lock</code> tag's text. For example, to lock a blast furnace at (0,64,0) so that the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Blast Furnace Key", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 <nowiki>{lock:{components:{"custom_name":"Blast Furnace Key"}}}</nowiki>}}.

=== Note blocks ===
Blast furnace can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Block data ===
A blast furnace has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

{{see also|Block entity format}}
<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
** {{nbt|short|lit_time_remaining}}: Number of ticks left before the current fuel runs out.
** {{nbt|short|cooking_time_spent}}: Number of ticks the item has been smelting for. The item finishes smelting when this value reaches 200 (10 seconds). Is reset to 0 if lit_time_remaining reaches 0.
** {{nbt|short|cooking_total_time}}: Number of ticks it takes for the item to be smelted.
**{{nbt|short|lit_total_time}}: Represent the total time the furnace should be lit.
** {{nbt inherit/nameable|indent=**}}
** {{nbt|list|Items}}: List of items in this container.
*** {{nbt|compound}}: An item in the blast furnace, including the slot tag:<br>Slot 0: The item(s) being smelted.<br>Slot 1: The item(s) to use as the next fuel source.<br>Slot 2: The item(s) in the result slot.
**** {{nbt inherit/item|indent=****}}
** {{nbt inherit/lockable|indent=**}}
** {{nbt|compound|RecipesUsed}}: Recipes that have been used since the last time a recipe result item was manually removed from the GUI. Used to calculate experience given to the player when taking out the resulting item. Is not preserved when removed.
*** {{nbt|int|''recipe ID''}}: How many times this specific recipe has been used. The ''recipe ID'' is the identifier of the smelting [[recipe]], as a [[resource location]], as used in the {{cmd|recipe}} command.
