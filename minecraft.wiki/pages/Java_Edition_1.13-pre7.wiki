== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
* Added {{cmd|scoreboard objectives modify ''<objective>'' displayname ''<displayname>''}}

== Changes ==
=== Fluids ===
'''[[Water]]'''
* Pressing the {{control|jump}} button in flowing water at <code>level=1</code>, <code>level=2</code> and <code>level=3</code> will now do normal jumps instead of {{control|swimming}} up.

=== Items ===
'''[[Map]]s'''
* Maps changed slightly in regards to which [[block]]s are shown and which blocks are not.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/8xo1ex/minecraft_113_map_rendering_changes/</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Advancement descriptions now have colors:
** Normal and goal advancements have green descriptions.
** Challenge advancements have purple descriptions.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* '''Left side:'''
** Added "Looking at liquid" row. Displays the targeted fluid's coordinates.
** "Looking at" row has been renamed "Looking at block" and now targets through liquids.
* '''Right side:'''
** "Targeted Block" information now targets through fluids.
** "Targeted Block" now displays information for blocks up to 16 blocks away.
** Added "Targeted Entity". Displays information for entities up to 4 blocks away (counting from the entity's hitbox).
* Changed {{key|F3+I}}<ref>F3+I was used to copy targeted block or entity data to clipboard.</ref> to now be {{key|Shift+F3+I}}. It is now clarified that it copies the client-side data of targeted block or entity. It still can be used by anyone.
* Added {{key|F3+I}} to copy targeted block or entity server-side data to clipboard. It can only be used by operators.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Drip particles are now generated by [[Waterlogging|waterlogged]] blocks where appropriate.<ref>{{bug|MC-127025}}</ref>
* Drip particles now snap to the hitbox of the block they appear on.<ref>{{bug|MC-1390}}</ref>

'''Other'''
