A '''shield''' is a defensive [[tool]] that can be used to block [[damage]] from melee attacks, ranged attacks and explosions. Shields are temporarily disabled when hit by an [[axe]] or attacked by a [[warden]] while blocking, and certain damage sources ignore a shield's protection. Shields can have ornamental [[banner]] designs applied to them.

== Usage ==
=== Defense ===
Shields are used for [[blocking]] incoming attacks. {{control|Using}}{{Only|Java|short=1}} or {{Control|sneaking}}{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}} causes a player to slow to a [[sneaking]] pace, and after {{convert|5|ticks|seconds}}<ref>{{bug|MC-100949||Shield blocking is delayed}}</ref>, attacks coming from in front of the player are blocked, dealing no damage. Shields deal knockback when blocking melee attacks, unless the entity is immune to knockback.{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}} When the shield blocks an attack of {{hp|3}} or stronger, it takes durability damage equal to the strength of the attack rounded up. When a player enters a boat, their shields exhibit the blocking animation.  

Most blocked projectiles that carry status effects (such as [[shulker bullet]]s, flaming [[arrow]]s, or tipped arrows {{Only|Java|short=1}}), do not affect the blocker, while the effects of tipped arrow still applies.{{Only|bedrock|short=1}} [[Channeling]] tridents still summon lightning upon blocking, but the trident itself does not damage the player.{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}} [[Trident]]s and arrows can be deflected into other targets. Knockback from melee attacks and projectiles is prevented, while knockback from [[explosion]]s, [[hoglin]], [[zoglin]], and [[ravager]] attacks are significantly reduced. {{Only|Java|short=1}}

The shield directionally blocks all attacks coming from within the horizontal direction the wielder is facing, providing a full semicylinder of coverage to them. Pitch is unaccounted for.

Mobs that deal continuous contact damage such as the [[slime]], [[magma cube]], and [[blaze]] rapidly drain the shield's durability for as long as the shielded player remains within the mob's hitbox.<ref>{{bug|MC-169167}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-119451||Slimes, magma cubes, and ender dragons can attack quickly, using up a shield's durability in seconds|Fixed}}</ref>

==== Blockable attacks ====
Attacks that can be blocked include:
*Melee attacks from all sources. When blocking melee attacks from axe-wielding players, axe-wielding mobs, and [[warden]]s, only a single attack can be blocked before a shield is disabled for 5 seconds.
** Status effects do not carry through to the blocker.
*Normal, tipped, and spectral [[arrow]]s
** Arrows other than [[Piercing]] are deflected and can hit other targets.
** Status effects do not carry through to the blocker.{{Only|Java|short=1}}
*[[Flame|Flaming arrows]]
** Burning does not carry through to the blocker.
*Thrown [[trident]]s
*[[Snowball]]s and [[egg]]s
*Spines from [[pufferfish]]
*Bullets from [[shulker]]s
** The Levitation effect does not carry through to the blocker.{{Only|Java|short=1}}
*Spit from [[llama]]s
*[[Fireball]]s, such as from [[blaze]]s and [[fire charge]]s
** Burning does not carry through to the blocker.
*Direct hits from [[ghast]] [[fireball]]s
** These still cause environmental damage.
*All explosions{{only|JE|short=1}}
*Explosion damage from [[creeper]]s
*[[TNT]] that another player lit
*Skull attacks from the [[wither]]
*[[Ravager]] headbutts
** These still knock the blocker back by about 3 blocks.
** Blocking these strikes has a chance to stun the ravager for a moment, and it roars afterward.
*Ravager roars are blocked but still knock back the blocker.
*[[Bee]] stings are blocked, but bees continuously attack until the player stops blocking and the player is stung.

==== Unblockable attacks ==== 
Attacks that cannot be blocked include:
*Arrows from a [[crossbow]] enchanted with [[Piercing]]
** This does not reduce the shield's durability.
** Direct projectile damage is blocked, but the effect from a tipped arrow still carries through.
*Lightning, even from Channeling tridents
*Status effects from splash/lingering [[potion]]s, [[evoker]]s' fangs, or breath from the [[ender dragon]]
*Warden's sonic boom attack
*TNT that the blocking player lit themselves{{only|BE|short=1}}
*TNT that a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone mechanism]] lit{{only|BE|short=1}}
*[[Fall damage]], including that from [[ender pearl]]s
** This also includes when the player rides an [[entity]] that died due to fall damage.

Laser beam attacks from [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s are only partially blocked (reduces damage by 50%).

=== Disabling ===
*All of a user's shields are disabled for 5 seconds if hit by an [[axe]]-wielding player while the user's shield is up.
*Melee strikes from a warden or any axe-wielding mob (e.g., [[vindicator]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, [[zombie]]s, etc) also disable shields for 5 seconds.
*A shield cannot be disabled during their 5 game tick blocking delay. The shield must be fully active to be disabled.

=== Applying patterns ===
[[File:Cyan Shield Screenshot.png|250px|thumb|A custom shield.]]
Shields can be decorated by applying a [[banner]].

{{Crafting
|showdescription=1
|Shield
|Matching Banner
|Output=Matching Shield
|B2link=Banner
|Olink=Shield
|type=Combat
|description=Applies the banner pattern to the shield. The banner is consumed.<br>The shield must have no preexisting patterns.<br>Does not change existing durability or enchantments on the shield.
}}

Unlike with [[banner]]s, shields cannot be repainted or washed in a [[cauldron]]. Shields have only half the resolution of banners, making patterns look slightly different. In the game files, the pattern textures can be found in a separate directory called <code>entity/shield</code>.

{{IN|java}}, shields with patterns can also be obtained using the same commands as banners, except <code>banner</code> has to be replaced with <code>shield</code>.

{{Calculator|banner|icon=shield}}

=== Repairing ===

==== Unit repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
|head=1
|Damaged Shield

}}

A shield can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[planks]] or another shield. Shields repaired on anvils retain their pattern. One plank restores 25% of the shield's durability.{{verify}}

=== Enchantments ===
A shield can receive the following [[enchantments]]:

{| class="wikitable col-3-center"
