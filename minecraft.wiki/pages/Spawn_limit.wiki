{{About|entities spawn limit in Legacy Console Edition|similar concept in Java Edition|Mob spawning#Java Edition mob cap}}
{{exclusive|console|new3ds}}
{{conjecture}}
To prevent the game from lagging or running out of usable memory {{in|console}} and {{in|new3ds}}, most entities have a maximum number of how many can exist in a world. If the player attempts to spawn another mob when the maximum number has been reached, a [[chat]] message will appear, explaining that the limit has been reached. Only entities which are in loaded [[chunk]]s are counted.

== In Legacy Console Edition ==
{{wip|section=yes|We have just learned that the limits are ''not'' the same on every console. Testing is currently being done by Project LCE.}}

Breedable mobs also have a breeding limit, which is lower.

=== Behavior ===
[[Spawn egg]]s and [[fish bucket]]s cannot be used if the limit for the corresponding [[mob]] has been reached. [[Player]]s are unable to breed [[animal]]s for which the breeding limit has been reached but may still be able to spawn them using spawn eggs if the spawn limit is not reached yet. Thrown [[egg]]s are unable to spawn more chickens if the breeding limit is reached. [[Mooshroom]]s cannot be [[shear]]ed if the breeding limit for animals has been reached. [[Villagers]] are unable to turn into a [[zombie villager]] if the spawn limit for enemies has been reached and will die regardless of [[difficulty]]. When [[experience orb]]s are spawned while its limit has been reached, the oldest experience orbs will vanish. If TNT is ignited while the limit for primed [[tnt|TNT]] has been reached, the TNT will vanish. If the limit for [[falling block]]s has been reached, gravity affected [[block]]s will not fall until the amount of falling blocks decreases. [[Paintings]] and [[item frame]]s also have a rendering cap of 100 on the screen, which is divided when using split screen. Attempting to build a [[wither]], [[snow golem]] or [[iron golem]] while the limit has been reached, causes the blocks to drop as items. [[Wandering trader]] spawn eggs do not spawn the [[trader llamas]] if the limit for [[animal]]s is reached. Spawn limits also limit the amount of entities that can go through [[portals]] before the chunks on the other side are loaded. This counter is however not saved upon reloading the world. [[Monster spawner]]s play a sound when failing to spawn mobs due to spawn limits. [[Silverfish stone]] does not spawn silverfish when mined while the spawn limit for enemies is reached. [[Wither]]s may spawn less than 3 [[wither skeleton]]s when reaching half health when the enemy spawn limit is almost reached.

=== Bypassing ===
Spawn limits may be bypassed by having [[entities]] in unloaded [[chunk]]s. Spawn limit for villagers can be bypassed by curing [[zombie villager]]s. By spawning 5 [[wither]]s in the End while the [[ender dragon]] is not alive it is possible to have 6 boss mobs after respawning the ender dragon. [[Slime]]s and [[magma cube]]s can still split into smaller ones when killed even if the spawn limit has been reached. Triggering a [[skeleton horse]] trap bypasses the limit. [[Pig]]s and [[villager]]s may be struck by a [[lightning]] and turn into [[zombie pigmen]] or [[witch]]es even if the spawn limit for [[enemies]] has been reached. [[Evoker]]s can spawn [[vex]]es even when the spawn limit for enemies is reached, bypassing the limit. Additionally, [[zombie]]s and its variants can bypass the limit by spawning [[reinforcement]]s. [[Dragon egg]]s still fall even if the limit for [[falling block]]s has been reached (but are counted to the limit when falling), meaning that an infinite amount of dragon eggs can fall at once. [[Ocelot]] spawn eggs used when there are 88 or 89 animals still have a chance to spawn 2 additional baby ocelots, bypassing the limit. [[Ender pearl]]s may still spawn endermites when the enemy spawn limit is reached. [[Zombie siege]]s are still able to spawn when the enemy spawn limit is reached.

== In ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' ==

Due to the more limited nature of the New Nintendo 3DS hardware, spawn limits are much stricter than Legacy Console Edition and span fewer categories.
