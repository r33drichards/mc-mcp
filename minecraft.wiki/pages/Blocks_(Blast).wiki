[[File:MCB Gameplay.png|thumb|360x360px|Blocks within the levels of ''Minecraft Blast''.]]

'''Blocks''' are the main components of each level of ''[[Minecraft Blast]]''. They are used to destroy, clear or collect [[Blockers (Blast)|blockers]] by tapping on matching blocks that are next to the blockers.

Different numbers of colored blocks will create different [[Boosters (Blast)|boosters]], which can be used for different purposes, where tapping or swiping them to activate will use a move. The blocks can be swiped together, where they will combine their effects.

Blocks of a certain color can be destroyed in order to unlock certain rewards in the [[Crafting Masters (Blast)|crafting masters]] screen (currently yellow).

|Blocks can be tapped or swiped when at least two or more blocks of the same color are touching each other within a level. Once the blocks have been matched, they will disappear and trigger any blockers next to them to be either destroyed or collected and will count up to the goal.

|Potion
|[[File:MCB 4 Block icon.png|100px]]
|Groups of four blocks will create a potion, which when tapped will destroy all blocks directly adjacent. The potion will then drop on a random blocker.
|-
|Firework
|[[File:MCB 6 Block icon.png|100px]]
|Groups of 5-6 blocks will create a firework rocket, which when tapped will blast through its row or column, depending on the direction the rocket is facing. Rockets can also be swiped and activated, moving them one block in one direction to aim for certain places.
|-
|TNT
|[[File:MCB 8 Block icon.png|100px]]
|Groups of 7-8 blocks will create TNT, which when tapped will blow through a large portion of the blocks.
|-
|End Crystal
|[[File:MCB 10 Block icon.png|100px]]
|Groups of 9 or more blocks will create an End crystal. It will appear with the most common color on the board at that time, potentially changing after each move. When tapped, it will destroy all blocks of that color.
