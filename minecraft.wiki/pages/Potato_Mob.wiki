{{Joke feature}}

'''Potato Mobs''' are a joke subcategory of [[mob]]s, added in [[24w14potato]]. They can spawn naturally in the [[Potato dimension]], although not every mob spawned in this dimension is considered a potato mob.

All potato mobs receive bonus damage from the [[potato peeler]].

== New mobs ==
From five mobs added in this update, three are considered potato mobs. They are separate entities and hold their potato status no matter the dimension they are in.

* {{EntityLink|Batato}}
** Spawns commonly in the dark areas of Potato dimension, uncommonly in the Overworld.
* {{EntityLink|Mega spud}}
** Spawns once in every [[colosseum]].
* {{EntityLink|Poisonous potato zombie}}
** Spawns commonly in the dark areas of Potato dimension, uncommonly in the Overworld, as well as during the mega spud's third phase.

== Existing mobs ==
Some other mobs received potato variants, that appear if the mob is in the Potato dimension. They have custom textures and some of them drop [[potato peels]], if killed by the potato peeler, but only while being in this dimension. This data is not stored on the mob, but rather enforced by the dimension itself: for example, a normal chicken immediately transforms into a potato chicken upon arriving in the Potato, and vice versa.
