'''Item components''' are [[JSON]] formatted for [[items]] in [[add-on]]s used to change how your item looks and functions in the world, and also have NBT components that also work on vanilla items.

== Applying components ==
They are applied within the {{cd|components}} field within the {{cd|minecraft:item}} field, components can also be applied to vanilla items, but unlike custom items they are limited to a few components.

== Component types ==
=== <code>minecraft:allow_off_hand</code> ===
Allows the item to be placed in the [[offhand]] but does not allow use of the item.

It has no field, it must be a boolean value being either {{cd|true}} or {{cd|false}}.

Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="json" copy>
"minecraft:allow_off_hand": true
</syntaxhighlight>

=== <code>minecraft:block_placer</code> ===
Allows the item to place blocks when used, if used in [[survival]] the item is consumed.

The available fields are:
* '''{{cd|block}}''':
** Defines the block that will be positioned.
* '''{{cd|replace_block_item}}''':
** Defines whether the item will replace the block, it can be {{cd|true}} or {{cd|false}} if it is {{cd|true}} the block and the item must have the same {{cd|identifier}} and the {{cd|minecraft:icon}} field can be omitted merging the two into one thing.
* '''{{cd|use_on}}''':
** List of block descriptors that contain blocks this item can be used on. If left blank, all blocks will be allowed. This also applies to [[Creative]] mode.
Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="json" copy>

    "replace_block_item": true,

== Custom components ==

Custom item components allow for custom items to take advantage of [[script API]] capabilities. Custom components are registered in scripts using the method {{cd|StartupEvent.itemComponentRegistry.registerCustomComponent()}}.

Custom components can be added to items the same way as any other component, using the namespaced [[identifier]] the component was registered with. Custom components can have arguments of any type, which will be passed to scripts as the second argument.

Examples:
<syntaxhighlight lang=json copy>
"example_namespace:example_component": "foo",
"example_namespace:example_component2": 4,
"example_namespace:example_component3": [ "hello", "world" ],
"example_namespace:example_component4": true,
"example_namespace:example_component5": {
  "stuff": 4
}
</syntaxhighlight>

In scripts, the custom component object can have methods added to listen to any amount of the following events<ref>{{cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/itemcustomcomponent?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=minecraft/server.ItemCustomComponent Interface|website=Microsoft Learn|date=December 3, 2025}}</ref>:

* {{cd|onBeforeDurabilityDamage}}: Called when the item hits an entity and is about to take [[durability]] damage.
* {{cd|onCompleteUse}}: Called when the item's use duration was completed.
* {{cd|onConsume}}: Called when the item is eaten by an entity.
* {{cd|onHitEntity}}: Called when the item is used to hit an entity.
* {{cd|onMineBlock}}: Called when the item is used to mine a block.
* {{cd|onUse}}: Called when the item is used by a player.
* {{cd|onUseOn}}: Called when the item is used on a block.

== NBT Components ==
Item NBT components are a little different from regular components, they are stored internally by the game and can only be modified by commands like {{cmd|give}} or {{cmd|replaceitem}} much like {{JE}} [[data components]].

{{Cmd|give @s cobblestone 64 0 {"minecraft:can_place_on":{"blocks":["stained_glass:2"]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>}}

=== <code>minecraft:can_destroy</code> ===
Controls what types of blocks this item can destroy.

Example:
{{Cmd|give @a wooden_axe 16 0 {"minecraft:can_destroy":{"blocks":["wool:5"]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>}}

=== <code>minecraft:item_lock</code> ===
Locks the item in the player's inventory depending on the chosen mode. Having the {{cd|mode}} parameter that specifies the lock type. Which can be {{cd|lock_in_inventory}} or {{cd|lock_in_slot}}.<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/pt-br/articles/360052592091-Minecraft-1-16-100-Bedrock-|title=Minecraft - 1.16.100 (Bedrock)|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=November 16, 2020}}</ref>

Example:
{{cmd|give @p diamond_axe 1 0 {"minecraft:item_lock":{"mode":"lock_in_inventory"<nowiki>}}</nowiki>}}

==== <code>lock_in_slot</code> ====
[[File:Item lock red.png|32px|class=pixel-image|The texture used on the item.]]

Prevents the item from being moved or removed from its slot in the player's inventory, dropped, placed stacked, and used as a crafting ingredient. It displays a red triangle in the top corner of the item.

Example:
{{cmd|give @p wooden_pickaxe 1 0 {"minecraft:item_lock":{"mode":"lock_in_slot"<nowiki>}}</nowiki>}}

=== <code>keep_on_death</code> ===
