A '''barrel''' is a solid [[block]] used to store [[item]]s. Unlike a [[chest]], it cannot connect to other barrels. It also serves as a [[fisherman]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Barrels can be mined with or without any [[tool]], but [[axe]]s are the quickest.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Barrel|Axe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Empty barrels can generate naturally in fisher cottages in [[village]]s. Up to 3 barrels can generate in a village fisher cottage.

In [[trial chambers]], barrels containing loot can be found in the corridors, while empty barrels generate beneath [[hopper]]s at chamber entrances.

=== Generated loot ===

== Usage ==
Barrels can be moved by [[piston]]s.{{only|bedrock}} [[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around barrels without affecting them. Lava can create [[fire]] in air blocks next to barrels as if the barrel was flammable, but the barrel does not actually catch fire and can't burn away.

=== Container ===
[[File:Barrel GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|The GUI of the barrel.]]

Barrels have a container inventory with 27 slots, which is the same as a single [[chest]]. Unlike chests, the action of opening a barrel is never prevented.
They can be filled by [[dropper]]s and both filled and emptied by [[hopper]]s. When broken, barrels drop the contents of the container and the barrel item itself. 

To open the barrel interface, use the {{control|Use Item}} control. To move items between the barrel inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the barrel interface is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding {{key|Shift}} and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the barrel to the extent that space is available for them.{{only|Java}} To exit the barrel interface, use the {{key|Esc}} control.

By default, the interface of a barrel is labeled "Barrel". A barrel's GUI label can be changed by naming the barrel in an [[anvil]] before placing it or by using the {{cmd|data}} command{{only|Java}} (for example, to label a barrel at (0,64,0) as "Bonus Barrel!", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 <nowiki>{CustomName:'"Bonus Barrel!"'}</nowiki>}}).

{{IN|je}}, a barrel can be "locked" by setting its <code>lock</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command. If a barrel's <code>lock</code> tag is not blank, the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item that matches the item predicate in the <code>lock</code> tag. For example, to lock a barrel at (0,64,0) so that the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Barrel Key", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 <nowiki>{lock:{components:{"custom_name":"Barrel Key"}}}</nowiki>}}.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a barrel has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to fisherman and claim the barrel as their [[job site block]].

=== Fuel ===
Barrels can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Note Blocks ===
Barrels can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s become hostile toward players who open or break barrels.
