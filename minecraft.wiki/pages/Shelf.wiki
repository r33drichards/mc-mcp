A '''shelf''' is a [[block]] that can store and display up to three [[stack]]s of [[item]]s. A shelf can be {{ctrl|used}} to swap its slots with the slots in the [[player]]'s [[hotbar]]. It swaps 1 slot normally, and 3 slots at a time when [[powered]] with redstone.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Shelves can be broken by hand, but using an [[axe]] is the fastest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Shelf|link=none|Axe}}

=== Crafting ===

|B1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|C1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem

|type = Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
[[File:Shelf demonstration.png|thumb|Oak, spruce, and pale oak shelves holding various items. Three pale oak shelves have received a redstone signal.]]
{{IN|java}}, shelves cannot be moved by [[piston]]s.

=== Holding items ===
A shelf can store up to 3 [[item]] stacks. Each slot of the shelf can store a full stack of any stackable item, or just one of a non-stackable item. The number of items in the stack is not displayed. The shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an [[item frame]]. Interacting with any of the 3 slots swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot if it is not powered by redstone.

=== Redstone  ===
[[File:25w31a shelf priority.png|thumb|alt=Two in-game screenshots: the top screenshot taken before and the bottom screenshot taken after. In the before picture, five shelves are placed next to each other in a row, the two shelves on either end are powered and connected, and the shelf in the middle is unpowered. The after picture is identical, except the middle shelf is powered, connecting to the two shelves on the left.|Powered shelves connect with shelves on the left first.]]
While a shelf is powered by [[redstone]], its front texture changes to show its powered state; when placed next to each other, up to three powered shelves can connect together. Powered shelves prioritize connecting to other shelves on the left.

Powered shelves can be used to quickly swap the contents of a player's [[hotbar]], similar to the [[Saved Hotbars]]{{only|je|short=1}} function in [[Creative]] mode.
*Interacting with a single powered shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost slots in the hotbar.
*Interacting with two connected shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost slots in the hotbar.
*Interacting with three connected shelves swaps their contents with all 9 slots of the hotbar.

It does not matter which of the connected shelves the player interacts with.

{{in|be}}, the shelf only activates on the Input/Consume redstone tick ([[C-tick]]).

==== Comparators ====
[[File:25w31a shelf comparator outputs.png|thumb|alt=Eight shelves in a row, containing the following items from left-to-right (where 0 represents no item and 1 represents an item): 000, 100, 010, 110, 001, 101, 011, 111; corresponding to signal strengths 0-7 respectively|Shelf signal strength]]
Shelves can also act as power sources for [[redstone comparator]]s depending on what slots contain an item.

* An item in the left slot will emit a redstone power of 1.
* An item in the middle slot will emit a redstone power of 2.
* An item in the right slot will emit a redstone power of 4.

If multiple slots contain an item, the comparator will output the total, up to a maximum power of 7 if all slots are filled.

==== Hoppers and droppers ====
Shelves can be filled automatically by using either [[hopper]]s or [[dropper]]s. Hoppers can also remove items from a shelf when placed underneath.

Items from a shelf are added and removed from left to right and will stack stackable items into one slot until that slot is full.

=== Fuel ===
Overworld shelves can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per shelf.

Nether shelves cannot be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s.

=== Note blocks ===
Shelves can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

== Sounds ==
=== Generic ===
{{Sound table/Block/Chiseled bookshelf}}

Despite shelves using the <code>chiseled_bookshelf</code> sound type for its generic sounds, {{in|je}}, the following resource locations also exist: <code>block.shelf.break</code>, <code>block.shelf.place</code>, <code>block.shelf.hit</code>, <code>block.shelf.fall</code>, and <code>block.shelf.step</code>.
