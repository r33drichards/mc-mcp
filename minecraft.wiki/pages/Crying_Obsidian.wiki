'''Crying obsidian''' is a luminous variant of [[obsidian]] that can be used to craft a [[respawn anchor]]. Purple particles drip from its faces. Like [[obsidian]], It has high [[hardness]] and [[blast resistance]], making it immune to normal [[explosion]]s. It can be obtained by mining it with a diamond or netherite pickaxe.

== Obtaining ==
There is no way to convert normal obsidian into crying obsidian. It can be obtained only via the methods listed below.

=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break crying obsidian is [[pickaxe]]. Crying obsidian needs to be broken using a [[diamond pickaxe]] or better, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.

Crying obsidian drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Crying obsidian generates as part of some [[ruined portal]]s.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|crying-obsidian}}

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s have a ~8.53% chance ({{frac|40|469}}) to [[barter]] 1–3 crying obsidian when given a [[gold ingot]].

== Usage ==
Much like obsidian, crying obsidian is a resilient building block. It has a [[blast resistance]] of 1,200 and cannot be destroyed by the [[ender dragon]]. However, crying obsidian cannot be used to create a [[nether portal]] frame,<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1232734609353388033|It's intentional that you cannot make portals with them.|February 26, 2020}}</ref> and the [[End crystal]] is unable to be placed on it.<ref>{{bug|MC-173416||Unable to place end crystal on crying obsidian|WAI}}</ref>

When placed, crying obsidian occasionally produces purple dripping particles, which are purely decorative.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Light ===
Crying obsidian gives off a [[light]] level of 10, which does not melt snow or ice. Its blast resistance distinguishes it from other light-emitting blocks.

=== Note blocks ===
Crying obsidian can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce the "bass drum" sounds.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Crying obsidian cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s, and cannot be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

== Trivia ==
* When it was originally going to be added in [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]], it was going to act as a way to reset the [[player]]’s [[spawn point]] and would be crafted using [[lapis lazuli]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2025|reason=What source stated that crying obsidian would be craftable using lapis lazuli?}} When beds were added, they took this role instead. In 1.16, the [[respawn anchor]] was added, which is crafted with crying obsidian.
* According to [[Brandon Pearce]], crying obsidian was added when they wanted to have cracked obsidian for the ruined nether portals. They decided to add it as crying obsidian instead because it was more unique and due to high player demand.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}
* The team considered having crying obsidian be obtained by throwing obsidian through a nether portal, or by having regular obsidian be struck by lightning. However, they chose bartering with piglins as a way to make bartering useful.<ref>{{Mcnet|block-week--crying-obsidian|Block of the Week: Crying Obsidian|July 29, 2020|Duncan Geere}}</ref>
* The earliest known instance of a developer referring to the original crying obsidian texture as "crying obsidian"<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|58821868924309504|For texture packers, the grass edge tile has replaced the crying obsidian in the texture file|April 15, 2011}}</ref> significantly postdates the name's general adoption by the community. The earliest known usages of the name "crying obsidian"<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fqonz/comment/c1hx4bi/</ref><ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fqpwe/comment/c1hxgbn/</ref> are from about two months earlier. As it had no given name, it was first referred to as a "mystery block" with crying obsidian being given as one potential name among others, such as "bleeding obsidian".<ref>https://minecraft.wiki/?title=Crying_Obsidian&diff=62580&oldid=62526</ref><ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fqffu/comment/c1hvl6p/</ref><ref>{{tweet|starclaws|40130586085572608|@notch What is this about 'bleeding obsidian' as the wiki is now calling it?|February 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/search?display-type=0&forum-scope=f&page=34&search=crying%20obsidian&search-type=0&submit=y</ref>
