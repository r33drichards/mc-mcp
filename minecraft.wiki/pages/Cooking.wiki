'''Cooking''' produces '''cooked food''' from raw food by using a [[furnace]], [[smoker]], [[campfire]], or by killing certain mobs with [[fire]]. Cooked [[food]] gives more {{Hungerbar|1}} [[hunger]] points when consumed than their raw food variant. Cooked food can also be obtained via [[trading]], and in certain [[loot chest]]s in some generated [[structure]]s.

== Methods ==
=== Fire ===
The following cooked food is dropped from their respective mobs when killed while on fire:
* {{ItemLink|Cooked Cod}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|cod}}, {{EntityLink|dolphin|text=dolphins}}, {{EntityLink|polar bear|text=polar bears}}, {{EntityLink|guardian|text=guardians}}{{only|java}} and {{EntityLink|elder guardian|text=elder guardians}}{{only|java}}
* {{ItemLink|Cooked Salmon}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|salmon}}, {{EntityLink|polar bear|text=polar bears}}, {{EntityLink|guardian|text=guardians}}{{only|java}} and {{EntityLink|elder guardian|text=elder guardians}}{{only|java}}
* {{ItemLink|Cooked Chicken}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|chicken|text=chickens}}
* {{ItemLink|Steak}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|cow|text=cows}} and {{EntityLink|mooshroom|text=mooshrooms}}
* {{ItemLink|Cooked Porkchop}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|pig|text=pigs}} and {{EntityLink|hoglin|text=hoglins}}
* {{ItemLink|Cooked Mutton}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|sheep}}
* {{ItemLink|Cooked Rabbit}}, an item dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|rabbit|text=rabbits}}
* {{ItemLink|Baked Potato}}, an item rarely dropped by igniting {{EntityLink|zombie|text=zombies}} and their variants

=== Campfire ===
The [[campfire]] or soul campfire has four slots on the block and does not contain an interface. Items are added to the campfire slots by pressing the {{Control|use|text=use}} button. Up to four [[Food|uncooked food items]] can be placed on a campfire, and they are cooked simultaneously. Cooking takes 30 seconds (600 game ticks) for each added item. The items drop from the campfire or soul campfire automatically after they finish cooking.

Campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook. As long as the campfire is lit, it can cook an infinite amount of food.

If the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, the remaining cooking time quickly counts back up. Food items can be placed on an unlit campfire. Any items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.

=== Furnace ===
Cooking with a [[furnace]] uses cooked food recipes to turn raw food into cooked food when combined with [[fuel]].
The furnace is a utility block with two functions: besides cooking, it also uses fuel to [[smelt|smelt]] materials. Each item takes 10 seconds to process.

=== Smoker ===
[[Smoker]]s are used to cook food items twice as fast as a [[furnace]], taking only 5 seconds per item instead of 10. Fuel is also used twice as fast, so the rate of cooked items per fuel item remains the same.

== Fuel ==
{{main|Smelting#Fuel}}
Fuel is required for cooking food with a [[furnace]] or [[smoker]]. [[Campfire]]s do not require fuel as the will remain lit unless extinguished.

There are multiple types of fuel that can smelt a different number of items.
