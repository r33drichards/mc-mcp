'''Salmon''' are common [[Bucket of aquatic mob|bucketable]] aquatic [[passive mob]]s found in [[ocean]]s and [[river]]s that are a source of [[Raw Salmon|raw salmon]] and, occasionally, [[Bone|bones]]{{Only|Bedrock}} or [[Bone Meal|bone meal]].{{Only|Java}}

== Spawning ==
Salmon spawn in small, normal, and large sizes. 31.6% spawn as small, 52.6% spawn as normal, and 15.8% spawn as large.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
Salmon spawn in groups of 1–5 in cold or frozen oceans, as well as their deep variants, subject to [[fish#Spawning|fish spawning requirements]]. They also spawn in rivers and frozen rivers.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Salmon spawn underwater at 12–32 blocks away from the player. They spawn in groups of 3–5 in lukewarm, cold, normal, frozen oceans, their deep variants, and rivers (including frozen rivers). In addition, salmon spawn on the surface (that is, there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top).

== Drops ==

|notes=
small_salmon = Only if salmon size is small or medium. 
large_salmon = Only if salmon size is large.
}}

*{{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Salmon tend to swim in schools with a maximum of 7 salmon per school. 

They can swim up approximately 4–5 blocks in waterfalls, emulating the behavior of real-world salmon that leap into and over small waterfalls to reach their spawning ground.

The player may collect salmon by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on it, which gives the player a [[bucket of salmon]]. Salmon placed with buckets do not despawn naturally. When the bucket of salmon is {{control|used}} against a block, it empties the bucket, placing water with the salmon swimming in it. An empty bucket may be used as well.{{only|bedrock}}

Salmon cannot be bred; they spawn naturally.

=== Weaknesses ===
Salmon cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until they die from suffocation. Salmon flip around on their sides. {{IN|bedrock}}, they rotate when flipping. Salmon also cannot swim or breathe in [[cauldron]] water.<ref>{{bug|MC-126819||fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fill with water|WF}}</ref>

{{IN|java}}, salmon have a weakness to weapons that have the [[Impaling]] enchantment, which also affects other fish and water mobs except [[drowned]].

[[Axolotl]]s always attack salmon on sight.
