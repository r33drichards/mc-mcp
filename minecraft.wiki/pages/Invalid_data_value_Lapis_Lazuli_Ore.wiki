'''Invalid data value lapis lazuli ore''' refers to item forms of the [[lapis lazuli ore]] block with damage values outside of the usual range which lapis lazuli ore can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==

=== Falling blocks ===
If a [[falling block]] of lapis lazuli ore stops in a position where it cannot convert to a placed block, such as on a torch or slab, it will drop as an item entity, as all falling blocks do. For lapis lazuli ore in particular, the damage associated with the dropped item will be 4, due to this also being the value associated with [[lapis lazuli]] to differentiate it from other dye items at that time.<ref>{{YouTube link|DdSUux2vBm8|Discovering a new Illegal Item and getting 75+ falling blocks - Technical Unobtained 13|Marpace|September 8, 2024|t=37m34s}}</ref>

While such a falling block can easily be created with commands, encountering one in typical Survival gameplay is impossible as the block is not affected by gravity. Actually generating such an entity in Survival is a comically involved process, but is ultimately achievable without mods, world editing, or command usage. A full explanation would be out of the scope of this page, but can be found [https://mcdf.wiki.gg/wiki/Java_Edition:Any_Falling_Block#Parallel_Asynchronous_Threads here].

=== Stacking ===
As lapis lazuli ore as an item does not track its damage value for any purpose, invalid data value lapis lazuli ore can be created by picking up dropped normal lapis lazuli ore with an incomplete stack of invalid data value lapis lazuli ore already in the inventory, as well as merging together existing item stacks. This can also result in invalid data value lapis lazuli ore being converted to non-anomalous lapis lazuli ore in the same way, and therefore care should be taken when transporting such items.

== Issues ==
Invalid data value lapis lazuli ore ''is'' an issue, and due to its removal, can be considered already fixed.
