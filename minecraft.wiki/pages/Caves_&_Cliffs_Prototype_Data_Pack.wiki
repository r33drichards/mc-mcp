The '''Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack''' is an official [[data pack]] that was released periodically by Mojang Studios from April 2021 to May 2021.<ref>[https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402614709389-Caves-Cliffs-Prototype-Data-Pack-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack for Minecraft Java Edition] – feedback.minecraft.net</ref> It contains several experimental and work-in-progress features, most of which were eventually released in [[Java Edition 1.18]]. Its first release coincided with the announcement that [[Caves & Cliffs]] would be split into two major updates.<ref>{{snap|21w15a|April 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|a-caves---cliffs-announcement|A Caves & Cliffs announcement|April 14, 2021}}</ref> The data pack was eventually superseded by [[:Category:Java Edition 1.18 experimental snapshots|experimental snapshots]] as changes that are too large for a data pack were introduced.<ref>{{Mcnet|new-world-generation-java-available-testing|New world generation in Java available for testing|July 13, 2021|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref>

== Features ==
; Items
* [[Bundle]]s can be crafted once again.

; General
* The [[height limit]] has been expanded 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down to a total of 384 blocks, with Y=319 being the limit upward and Y=-64 being the limit downward.

; World generation
* Deepslate [[ore (feature)|blob]]s no longer generate above Y=0.
* Diorite, granite, and andesite blobs are larger and more spherical, but less common.
* Underground generation has been extended 64 blocks down to go along with the downward height expansion.
** [[Deepslate]] makes up a majority of the expanded area, with the stone above gradually transitioning to it from Y=-1 to Y=-7 until it is completely replaced by deepslate at Y=-8.
*** Certain types of ores and structures still generate in the deepslate layer, as well as [[tuff]].
*** [[Dirt]], [[gravel]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], and [[andesite]] do not generate in this layer.
** [[Lava]] replaces air below Y=-53 instead of below Y=11.
** The [[bedrock]] layer has been moved down to Y=-64.
* [[Fossil]]s are able to generate at any height instead of just between Y=40 and Y=49.
** Fossils below Y=0 generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore.
* [[Cave]]s have been completely overhauled.
** Now stretch down to Y=-59.
** New [[noise cave]]s, coming in three forms: cheese, spaghetti, and noodle.
*** Cheese caves have large stone columns stretching from the bottom of the cave to the top.
**** Very large, often large enough to fly through with [[elytra]].
**** Abundant with [[spring]]s, aquifers, and [[ore]]s.
*** Spaghetti caves are long, thin caves that have small aquifers and are more similar to original caves.
*** Noodle caves are thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variants of spaghetti caves.
** Contain [[aquifers]], bodies of [[water]] with different heights, independent of sea level (Y=63).
*** Only used below Y=31, meaning any noise caves between Y=31 and Y=63 are flooded with water.
*** Aquifers below Y=0 sometimes generate with lava instead of water.
** The original [[carver]]s still exist with their generation slightly tweaked to add more variation and to better blend in with noise caves.
** New crevice carvers, which are deep, long cracks in the ground that are thinner and straighter than [[canyon]]s.
* [[Ore vein]]s, long and rare formations of [[ore]] and rock, have been introduced.
[[File:21w18a approximate ore distribution.jpg|thumb|300px|The new ore generation in the data pack.]]
* Changed the generation of all ores, making them have a spread value like [[lapis lazuli ore]]. Some still retain a linear generation alongside a spread generation.
** [[Copper ore]] generates between Y=0 and Y=96, and uses spread like all other ores. It peaks at Y=48.
** [[Emerald ore]] generates above Y=32 as a spread, peaking at Y=256 and decreasing in quantity as the [[altitude]] decreases.
** [[Coal ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of Y=96 and generating between an altitude of Y=0 and Y=192.
** [[Iron ore]] attempts to generate three times: once as a spread peaking at an altitude of Y=256, generating above Y=128; another as a spread peaking at Y=16 and generating with a minimum height of Y=-24 and a maximum height of Y=57, and a smaller one spreading evenly between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=64.
** [[Gold ore]] generates between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=32, peaking at Y=-16. The extra gold that generates in the [[badlands]] biome was left untouched.
** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, as a spread between the altitudes of Y=32 and Y=-32, peaking at an altitude of 0; and evenly between the altitudes of Y=64 and Y=-64, generating buried like [[ancient debris]].
** [[Redstone ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=15 and Y=-64; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of -64 and generating below an altitude of Y=-32.
** [[Diamond ore]] generates below Y=16 as a spread, peaking at Y=-64 and decreasing in quantity as the altitude increases.
