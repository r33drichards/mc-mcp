'''Mossy cobblestone''' is a variant of [[cobblestone]] with moss on it. It is mainly used for [[crafting]] or as building block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Mossy cobblestone can be mined using a [[pickaxe]], in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Mossy Cobblestone|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
Mossy cobblestone occurs naturally in [[monster room]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, [[pillager outpost]]s, cold [[ocean ruins]], and [[plains]] and [[taiga]] [[village]]s (as well as [[Village#Abandoned villages|zombie village]]s). It can also be found in the form of [[forest rock]]s in the [[old growth pine taiga]] and [[old growth spruce taiga]] biomes, and around zombie or baby zombie [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].
