'''Bad Luck''', also known as '''Unluck''', is a [[status effect]] found exclusively {{in|Java}} and {{LCE}} that decreases the chance of the player getting high-quality loot, contrary to [[Luck]].

== Effect ==
Bad Luck subtracts the effect level from the <code>luck</code> [[attribute]] , making [[loot table]] entries with a high <code>quality</code> score less likely, and entries with negative <code>quality</code> more likely. It also makes the chance of <code>bonus_rolls</code> occurring less likely. [[Fishing]] is the only mechanism that uses <code>quality</code>. The new weight of each entry is <code>floor(base_weight + quality × luck)</code>. Negative levels increase luck, similar to status effect [[Luck]].

== Causes ==
Bad Luck can only be obtained using [[commands]]. The {{cmd|effect}} command can apply it directly to an [[Entity]] or [[Player]], or you can obtain a Potion, Splash Potion, Lingering Potion, or Tipped Arrow using {{Cmd|give}}, although it will be referred to as an [[Uncraftable Potion]].

== Immune mobs ==
* [[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Bad luck.
* All [[mob]]s are unaffected by Bad luck.
