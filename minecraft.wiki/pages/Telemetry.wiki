[[File:Telemetry Data Collection screen.png|thumb|The telemetry data collection screen.]]
'''Telemetry Data Collection''' (formerly called '''Snooper''') is a feature that allows [[Mojang Studios]] to collect [[w:telemetry_(software)|telemetry]] data on the [[player]], from either the [[client]] or the [[server]]. On the telemetry data collection screen, the player can view the collected data and choose between sending a required "minimal" amount of data or an extended "all". It also includes a link to the stored data files.

This feature was removed globally in [[Java Edition 18w21a|18w21a]] because of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).<ref>{{bug|MC-130179#comment-455305}} "''This is Working as Intended due to GDPR.''"</ref> It was re-added in [[Java Edition 21w38a|21w38a]] to "improve players' experience",<ref>{{snap|21w38a|September 23, 2021}}</ref> and since then it is no longer possible to disable telemetry data collection completely without client modifications.
