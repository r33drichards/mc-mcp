* Texture changed from [[File:Glass JE1.png|32px]].<ref name="glass">[[#0619 logs|June 19 IRC logs]]: "''P5:59:14 <Notch> I might just revert the glass to the horrible non-transparent texture from the screenshot''" [...] "''P5:59:49 <Evil-Ville> I actually liked the old glass more Notch''" [...] "''P6:19:32 <Notch> I'm switching glass to a non-semi-trasparent texture''" [...] "''P6:25:51 <Redshift> yeah windows definitely need to be less opaque, personally i think they should have no texture, and just a slight hint of opacity''" (22:59 to 23:25 UTC) | "the screenshot" refers to {{tumblr|Notch|124718567|Glass (looks pretty bad..) and sponge!|June 16, 2009}} | The opaque glass texture refers to the [[File:Glass JE1.jpg|24px]] 0.0.19a texture.</ref><ref>[[#0622 logs|June 22 IRC logs]]: ''P1:17:31 <Haruhi2> the version that was semi-opaque looked more like ice than glass [...] then the version after that was fine [...] then he changed it a bit and now it doesn't really look like either''</ref>
* No longer semi transparent.
** This means that glass no longer goes invisible when selected, when looked at through [[water]] or when underground.

'''[[File:Sponge JE1.png|32px]] [[Sponge]]'''
* No longer decays.<ref>[[#0622 logs|June 19 IRC logs]]: ''P6:18:11 <Notch> should I take out the random vanish? [...] consider it done''</ref>

Make sure thehre's a level of water above both sponges and it'll flood the remaining one. [...] Notch: You going to be able to hotfix it? [...] P6:02:10 <Notch> maybe..''</ref>
* Fixed a bug causing sponges to block lava flooding.{{verify}}
