This guide is a simplified overview of all the changes in the {{BE}} 1.6.x releases, which assumes at least some familiarity with the [[Update Aquatic]] (Phase Two) (''Bedrock Edition'' 1.5.x releases).

== Mobs ==
=== New ===
{|{{Simple Guide table|New Mobs}} 
|-

* Phantoms are the fastest mob in the Overworld. Players are unable to outrun them. A good strategy versus phantoms is to obstruct their path, since they fly up if they collide with any block during an attack.
* [[Cat]]s hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 16 blocks away from them.
* Phantoms do not spawn if the player has a solid block above them, meaning they do not spawn around players underground or within enclosed structures. Additionally, they do not spawn if the player is below sea level.
* Sleeping through the night is not actually required. The statistic that controls their spawning is reset when the player leaves a bed, so simply entering and then leaving a bed is enough.
