'''[[Glass]]''' and '''[[Glass Pane]]'''
* Glass blocks and panes will now become slightly transparent if the camera is very close to them.

'''[[Shelf]]'''
* Adding or removing redstone power to or from the shelf now emits vibrations.
** When a player places/removes/swaps an item on an unpowered shelf, a vibration of frequency 3 is emitted.
** When a player places/removes an item on a powered shelf, a vibration of frequency 3 is emitted.
** When a player swaps item with one on a powered shelf, a vibration of frequency 6 is emitted.

'''[[Water]]'''
* Water now reduces the light level by one instead of two units per block.

=== General ===
'''Camera'''
* The first person camera will now offset backwards slightly when facing and climbing blocks such as [[ladder]]s and [[vine]]s.

'''Graphical'''
* Added TAA upscaling to weather effects like rain and snow.
* Improved quality of gamma correction on PC and Consoles.
* Mobs will now become slightly transparent when the camera gets too close or passes through them.
* Adjusted rendering settings in [[Vibrant Visuals]].
** Slightly reduced contrast across all [[biome]]s.
** Reduced the intensity of temperature-based color grading in warmer biomes, especially the [[desert]] and all [[badlands]].
** Adjusted the [[End sky|sky color]] in [[the End]].
** Added unique biome settings for the [[dark forest]], making it slightly foggier and gray.

'''[[Marketplace]]'''

'''[[Pause menu]]'''
[[File:Pause menu with screenshot button (Bedrock).png|thumb|The redesigned pause menu.]]
* The pause menu has been updated with a new layout and design.

'''[[Realms]]'''
[[File:Manage Realms Screen Menu "Saves" Tab Settings (Bedrock Preview 1.21.120.25).png|thumb|The new Realms saves settings screen.]]
* The backups system has been replaced with a general "Saves" system. There are two types of Realms saves:
** Automatic saves are functionally the same as the previous backups system:
*** They are taken at the end of every Realms play session when the server shuts down, or every 30 minutes during a play session.
*** They are only retained for a limited time, according to the retention policy (which has not changed with this update).
*** They do not count towards the bank of cloud storage.
*** They are on by default and can't be turned off.
*** All previous Realms backups will be converted to automatic saves.
** Manual saves are created by the Realm owner and count towards a bank of storage that comes with the Realms subscription.
*** Manual saves are retained as long as the Realm exists. They are not automatically deleted by the retention policy, but Realm owners can delete manual saves if they want to free up storage space.
*** Realms Plus subscriptions come with 10GB of manual save storage and Realms Core subscriptions come with 5GB.
*** Automatic saves can be turned into manual saves by the Realm owner.
** Realms saves can be found in the Realms settings menu accessed via the "Edit Realm" button rather than the Realms world settings menu that backups used to show up in. While playing on the Realm, saves can also be found in the in-game settings menu for the Realm owner.
** Realms saves will also now list the world name and the packs that were applied at the time of the save.

'''Storage'''
* Shifted download storage on PlayStation 4 to new location. Players may need to redownload Marketplace content.

'''GDK'''
*''Minecraft'' for Windows now runs on the latest GDK (Game Development Kit).
** This update brings the game in line with the standard distribution model on Windows platforms.
* File paths have been updated, and on first installation of this version of ''Minecraft'', existing worlds and content will be changed to:
* {{cd|%AppData%\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\Shared\games\com.mojang}} - is the new place to store packs.
* {{cd|%AppData%\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\<randomnumbers>\games\com.mojang}} - is the new place to store worlds and settings.
* {{cd|C:\XboxGames\Minecraft for Windows\Content\data}} - is the new place for the internal files.

Note: when not logged in into the Microsoft account, the packs will instead be stored at {{cd|C:\XboxGames\Minecraft for Windows\Content}}

'''UI'''
* Brightness adjustment was renamed to gamma adjustment in Vibrant Visuals.
* A "Reset to Defaults" button was added to the gamma adjustment screen in Vibrant Visuals.
* The slider widget that controls the Vibrant Visuals gamma value shows the current gamma value, and the center of the slider corresponds to the default value.

* Zombie chicken jockeys now drop the [[lava chicken music disc]] when killed by a tamed [[wolf]].

[[File:Drowned.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Drowned]]'''

** This change was not mentioned in the changelog.

'''[[File:Red Parrot.png|width=43x43]] [[Parrot]]'''
* Parrots imitating hostile mob sounds are now affected by the "Friendly Creatures" volume slider in settings.

[[File:Wither Skeleton JE4 BE3.png|width=50x50]] '''[[Wither Skeleton]]'''

'''Biome Components'''
* Added {{cd|underwater_addition}}, {{cd|underwater_loop}}, and {{cd|underwater_mood}} fields to {{cd|minecraft:ambient_sounds}}. They will be played when the audio listener position is inside of water.
** {{cd|underwater_addition}} and {{cd|addition}} now take both an asset and chance, the chance determines the chance for the sound to be played.
