'''Beta 1.20.50.22''' (Android) or '''Preview 1.20.50.22''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox) is the third beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.50]], released on October 25, 2023,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/articles/20699536679309/|title=Minecraft - Beta & ''Preview'' 1.20.50.22|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=October 25, 2023}}</ref> which changes mob attack reach calculation, adds copper and tuff family blocks under experimental features, introduces the new look of bats, brings more parity with {{JE}}, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added <code>projectilesCanBreakBlocks</code>, to control whether impact projectiles will destroy blocks that are destructible by them (i.e. [[chorus flower]]s, [[pointed dripstone]] and [[decorated pot]]s). Defaults to <code>true</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Chorus Flower]]'''
* Now can be destroyed by any projectile, which will no longer disappear after impact.

'''[[Decorated Pot]]'''
* Updated the shatter, break, and step sounds to be "smashier".

=== General ===
'''[[Loading world screen]]'''
* Now displays 3 categories of [[loading tips|tips]] based on player progression.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bat]]'''
* Their model, animations, and texture have been updated.

'''General'''
* Mobs on fire no longer spread [[fire]] to their target when holding something in their main hand.
* Changed mob attack reach calculation.
** In horizontal directions, mobs' attack reach are now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions, instead of using horizontal width to determine.
*** For example, a ravager won't be able to attack through a few block thick walls.
** In vertical directions, mobs' attack reach are now the exact vertical range of their bounding box. When there's no overlap between their bounding box and their target's bounding box in vertical direction, they can not attack, in specific:
*** Riding a medium-sized mob (e.g. horse) can get rid of attacks from short mobs (e.g. baby zombie).
*** Riding a tall mob (e.g. camel) can get rid of attacks from standard size mobs (e.g. zombie).
*** Some mob's reaching height now extended (e.g. enderman, safety height changed from 1.5 to 3).

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Update 1.21" and "Beta APIs" experimental toggles.

** When in crafting table, consume 2 [[cut copper slab]]s from the same type, resulting in 1 chiseled copper with the same type.
** When in stonecutter, consume 1 [[block of copper]], resulting in 4 chiseled copper from the same type.

'''[[Chiseled Tuff]]'''
* Can be crafted<ref name=ref2>Currently uncrafteable due an issue.</ref> from [[Tuff Slab|tuff slab]]s or can be obtained by cutting tuff using a [[stonecutter]].
