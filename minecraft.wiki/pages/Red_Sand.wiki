'''Red sand''' is a variant of [[sand]] found exclusively in [[badlands]] biomes.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break red sand is [[shovel]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Red Sand|Shovel}}
Red sand drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Red sand generates naturally in [[Badlands]] biomes and variants, always in a single layer. Unlike sand, there is no [[red sandstone]] that supports it below.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a red sand block drops the block upon death.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 4 red sand for 1 [[emerald]]. This is the only renewable method of obtaining red sand. Due to its low spawning rate and limited number of trades per spawn, it is more practical to obtain it through other means.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{main|Falling Block}}

If the supporting block below a block of red sand is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the red sand block turns into a "[[falling block]]" [[entity]], which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity is available in the main article listed above.

If falling red sand lands and covers the head of a [[mob]] or the [[player]], the mob or player buried in it continuously receives [[suffocation]] damage. If falling red sand lands in the space occupied by a non-solid block (such as [[torch]], [[rail]], or [[redstone dust]]) or a block [[Solid block#Height|less than a full block tall]] (such as [[slab]] or [[soul sand]]<ref>{{bug|MC-77079|||WAI}}</ref>), the red sand drops and turns into an [[Item (entity)|item]]. If it falls onto a [[cobweb]], it falls slowly until it has gone through completely; if it touches the ground while still inside the cobweb, the red sand becomes an item. Red sand that falls onto a [[Bubble Column#Upward|lifting bubble column]] floats on top of the water until the bubble column is blocked or removed.

Though [[TNT]] does not break any blocks if it explodes underwater, if [[sand]] (including red sand), [[concrete powder]] (in one-block-deep water only), or [[gravel]] falls and covers the TNT before it explodes, blocks are broken as normal. This trick can be used to collect blocks underwater, or break into underwater structures such as the [[ocean monument]] without mining.

=== Farms ===
[[Cactus]] can only be placed on red sand or [[sand]], and can also be used for farming [[bamboo]], [[sugar cane]] and [[kelp]].

=== Turtle eggs ===
A [[turtle egg]] can hatch on red sand, but not any other non-sand block.

=== Note blocks ===
Red sand can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "snare drum" sound.

=== Ambience ===
Red sand emits sandy [[Ambience|ambient noises]] independent from the current biome if there is a [[sand]], red sand, [[terracotta]] or [[stained terracotta]] block 8 blocks away in 3 of the 4 horizontal directions. The central red sand block must have access to the sky (i.e. should not be covered by any opaque or light-filtering block). The 3 other required blocks can be placed at different Y levels from the central block, but must be located on the [[Heightmap#WORLD_SURFACE|world surface]] (must not have any non-[[air]] blocks above them).

Additional windy ambient sounds play if the red sand block is located in a [[desert]], [[badlands]], [[wooded badlands]], or [[eroded badlands]] biome, provided it still meets the conditions described above.

If all the conditions for the respective ambient sounds are met, on each [[tick]] a red sand block has an {{frac|1|1600}} chance to play a sandy noise and an {{frac|1|10000}} chance to play a windy sound.
