A '''moss carpet''' is a thin decorative variant of the [[moss block]], resembling a [[carpet]] in functionality.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Moss carpets can be mined using any tool or without a tool, but a [[hoe]] is the quickest. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[sword]]s can also mine moss carpets slightly faster than most items, at 0.1 seconds. 

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Moss Carpet|Hoe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Moss carpets generate naturally in [[lush caves]] and [[mangrove swamp]]s. They can also generate in some entrance rooms of [[trial chambers]].

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A3= Moss Block
|B3= Moss Block
|Output= Moss Carpet,3
|type= Decoration block
}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on a [[moss block]] has a 25% chance to grow moss carpets.

[[Mangrove propagule]]s that grow into mangrove trees can generate moss carpets on their [[Mangrove Roots|roots]].

== Usage ==
Moss carpet has most of the properties of the standard [[carpet]], except that it is not [[flammable]], cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s, cannot be equipped on [[llama]]s, and does not occlude [[vibration]]s from [[sculk sensor]]s.

=== Composting ===
Placing a moss carpet into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Moss carpets break when pushed by pistons. They cannot be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.
