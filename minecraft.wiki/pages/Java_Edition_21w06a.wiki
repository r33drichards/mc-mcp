'''21w06a''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on February 10, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w06a|February 10, 2021}}</ref> which adds new [[cave]] generation and increased the [[Altitude|build height limit]] to 384.

Worlds created prior to this snapshot or after [[21w15a]] cannot be loaded and edited in this version without NBT editors, due to there being no upgrade path towards the expanded height limits in this snapshot. However, it is possible to use [[Combat Test]] snapshot worlds due to the [[data version]] exceeding that of the 1.17 snapshots.

== Additions ==
[[File:21w06a Cross Section.jpg|thumb|360px]]

=== World generation ===
'''{{EnvLink|Cave|text=Caves}}'''
* Added new noise caves, which come in two types: "spaghetti" and "cheese" caves.
* Added flooded aquifer caves.
* The old "carver" cave generation still generates, combining with the new caves.

'''{{EnvLink|Spaghetti cave|text=Spaghetti caves}}'''
* Long, narrow caves.
* Utilize [[noise generator]]s for generation.
* Can form cave entrances when they intersect with land.

'''{{EnvLink|Cheese cave|text=Cheese caves}}'''
* Utilize [[noise generator]]s for generation.
* Often form caverns of various sizes.
* Can form cave entrances when they intersect with land.

'''{{EnvLink|Aquifer|text=Aquifers}}'''
* Used to generate bodies of [[water]] in new caves.
* Currently only used below Y=31, meaning any noise caves between Y=31 and Y=63 are flooded with water. This is fixed in [[Java Edition 1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1]].
* [[Magma block]]s may generate at the bottom of these new water bodies, creating downward bubble columns.
* Replaces the old underwater cave carvers/canyons.
* [[Fish]] spawn in aquifers if it is under an [[ocean]] or [[river]].

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Added {{Nbt|boolean|aquifers_enabled}} and {{Nbt|boolean|noise_caves_enabled}} to <code>worldgen/noise_settings/*.json</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Big dripleaf]]'''
* No longer stops tilting while sneaking on, jumping on, or even jumping off it.
* Now tilts quicker.
* Now tilts when hit with a projectile, instead of being broken.
* Can now be used with redstone.
** Powering a dripleaf now prevents it from tilting down (except for projectiles).
** Powering an already tilted dripleaf tilts it back up.
** Unpowering a dripleaf down allows it to tilt down again.

'''[[Hanging roots]]'''
* Texture has been changed.

'''[[Lava]]'''
* No longer replaces air.

'''[[Small dripleaf]]'''
* Texture has been changed.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Chunk]]s'''
* The [[Overworld]] now has a total [[Altitude|height]] of 384 blocks.
** The world has been extended 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, which means it's now possible to build from layer -64 to layer 319 in the Overworld.
** Ore placement below Y=0 is temporary, and underground lava does not generate properly yet.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1359564082110746625|We added noise caves, changed world height, and added aquifers (local water levels). Summarized in this pic. Note that the underground biomes don't generate quite yet. Try it, give us feedback!}}</ref>

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Mineshaft pieces no longer generate if they were fully floating in the air.
* Corridors now generate with (bark) [[wood]] pillars for support if needed.
* Cobwebs no longer generate floating without an adjacent block.

=== General ===

[[File:116terrain117.png|thumb|1.16 world loaded in 21w06a by changing the level.dat]]
'''World selection menu'''
* Disabled the loading of old worlds temporarily.
** This can be bypassed by setting the data version in <code>[[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]]</code> to 2694 or higher. However, this may cause issues.

== Fixes ==

== Trivia ==
* This snapshot marks the first time since [[12w07a]], almost exactly 9 years prior, that the height limit was increased.
** This is also the first time that the build limit has been increased downwards.
