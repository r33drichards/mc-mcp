'''''0x10<sup>c</sup>''''' was a space sandbox game that was being developed by [[Markus Persson|Markus "Notch" Persson]] and [[Mojang AB]] during 2012 and 2013 as a followup to ''[[Minecraft]]''. It has since been cancelled.

"0x" is a prefix used in several programming languages to indicate a hexadecimal number. "0x10<sup>c</sup>" (ten to the power of C) is a hexadecimal number equivalent to 16<sup>12</sup> in decimal, which equals 281,474,976,710,656, which was the number of years that had passed since 1988 in the game's story.

On January 30, 2024, Notch tweeted,<ref>https://twitter.com/notch/status/1752358057185780005</ref> wondering if the name ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' went under Microsoft's name when they acquired Mojang.

In March 2011, Notch was asked in an interview if Mojang had any plans for another game, and Notch expressed his desire to create an "extremely nerdy" space trading simulator.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=tr1jf|text=History of pre-alpha 0x10c (wip):|author=jecowa|date=May 16, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-minecraft-creator-mojang|title=A Day In The Life Of Minecraft Creator Mojang|website=Rock Paper Shotgun|author=John Walker|date=March 7, 2011}}</ref> Later, in December 2011, Notch announced he would be stepping down as lead developer of ''Minecraft'', and that he would begin working on another project.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813083715/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/13633493969/och-med-dom-orden-s%C3%A5-passar-jag-micken|title=Och med dom orden så passar jag micken.|website=Tumblr|author=Notch|date=December 2, 2011}}</ref> Mojang CEO [[Carl Manneh]] said in an interview with Edge Online in January 2012 that Mojang was committed to supporting a new project that Notch was developing.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115211340/http://www.edge-online.com/news/mojang-working-three-new-games|title=Mojang working on three new games|website=Edge Online|author=Nathan Brown|date=January 13, 2012}}</ref> In March 2012, he revealed that there were three different projects he was working on, but he had yet to decide which one he was committed to.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.vg247.com/2012/03/17/notch-hoping-to-focus-on-a-new-project-by-this-summer/|title=Video: Minecraft boss talks three projects, BAFTA thrill|website=VG24/7|author=Staff|date=March 17, 2012}}</ref> On March 13th, he announced he would begin prototyping a space game,<ref>{{tweet|notch|179614763750400001|Screw it, I know I'm working on two projects already, but I'll start prototyping the space game now.|March 13, 2012}}</ref> and on March 21st, in an interview with PC Gamer magazine, he announced that he was working on a space-themed game that was inspired by the television show ''Firefly'' and the video game ''Elite''.<ref name=firefly>{{citation|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/notch-wants-to-make-a-firefly-inspired-sandbox-space-game-like-elite-except-done-right/|title=Notch wants to make a Firefly-inspired sandbox space game like Elite "except done right"|website=PC Gamer|author=Tom Senior|date=March 21, 2012}}</ref>

On April Fools' Day 2012, instead of a typical ''Minecraft'' [[April Fools]] joke, as was the case the prior year and every year since, Mojang launched a satirical website for a space game entitled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402231307/http://marseffect.net/ Mars Effect]'',<ref>{{tweet|notch|186155683677351937|Some information on my new game: http://marseffect.net|March 31, 2012}}</ref> citing a lawsuit with Bethesda regarding the title of the Mojang game ''[[Scrolls]]'' as an inspiration.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402174313/https://www.shadowlocked.com/201203312487/news/minecraft-creator-scores-april-fool-with-project-mars-effect.html|title=Minecraft creator scores April Fool with 'Mars Effect'|website=Shadowlocked|author=Rebecca Fields|date=March 31, 2012}}</ref> However, the gameplay elements remained true, and on April 3, 2012, Mojang revealed it as an actual space sandbox title, ''0x10<sup>c</sup>''.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/04/03/mojang-registers-website-for-its-new-game-0x10c/|title=Mojang Registers Website For Its New Game '0x10c'|website=Forbes|author=Alex Knapp|date=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

The game's backstory, as told by Notch on the website, was this:

{{q|In a parallel universe where the space race never ended, space travel was gaining popularity amongst corporations and rich individuals.

In 1988, a brand new deep sleep cell was released, compatible with all popular 16 bit computers. Unfortunately, it used big endian, whereas the DCPU-16 specifications called for little endian. This led to a severe bug in the included drivers, causing a requested sleep of 0x0000 0000 0000 0001 years to last for 0x0001 0000 0000 0000 years.

It's now the year 281 474 976 712 644 AD, and the first lost people are starting to wake up to a universe on the brink of extinction, with all remote galaxies forever lost to red shift, star formation long since ended, and massive black holes dominating the galaxy.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405053335/http://0x10c.com/|title=0x10c.com (first version)}}</ref>|Notch}}

The game was to feature:
*Hard science fiction
*Lots of engineering
*Fully working computer system
*Space battles against the AI or other players
*Abandoned ships full of loot
*Duct tape
*Seamlessly landing on planets
*Advanced economy system
*Random encounters
*Mining, trading, and looting
*Single and multi player connected via the multiverse

Of particular interest was the in-game computer, the DCPU-16. This was a fully functioning emulated 16 bit CPU that could be used to control the entire ship, or just to play games on while waiting for a large mining operation to finish. Full specifications of the CPU were released soon after the game's announcement, so the more programatically advanced of the playerbase could get a head start.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210524201825/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/20056289891/startclassifiedtransmission?is_related_post=1|title=START_CLASSIFIED_TRANSMISSION|website=Tumblr|author=Notch|date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> These specifications, along with the specifications for several pieces of in-game hardware that would be able to interface with the DCPU-16, can be found [https://github.com/lucaspiller/dcpu-specifications here].

''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' was planned to require its players to pay a monthly subscription fee in order to access the global multiplayer server that was planned to exist, due to the computational cost of simulating the trajectories and onboard systems of all the players' ships, even when the players piloting those ships weren't logged in.<ref name=pc1/> A recurring fee would not be required to play singleplayer, and it's likely there would be the option to play on smaller, privately hosted servers for free, as in ''Minecraft''.<ref name=multiplayer/> The initial cost of buying the game was planned to start out small and increase as the game was developed, similarly to how ''Minecraft's'' price increased during the first few years of its development.

Soon after the announcement of ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'', Notch began posting on Twitter about his plans for the game, and began putting images of the prototype versions on his website.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=games|id=s4tt1|text=First Screens from Notch's New Game 0x10c|author=TL10|date=April 11, 2012}}</ref> A [https://web.archive.org/web/20180308193746/http://www.0x10cforum.com/ forum], [https://reddit.com/r/0x10c Reddit community], [https://web.archive.org/web/20130725135043/http://0x10cwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page wiki], and numerous other fan-made websites were created, and Notch began communicating with fans about the game on the Reddit community as well.

On April 16, 2012, Notch posted [https://web.archive.org/web/20120803014301/http://www.0x10c.com/screenshots/009.png an image] on the ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' website containing a puzzle.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=sdeq2|text=Notch posts a puzzle|author=Zengief|date=April 16, 2012}}</ref> When decoded, it revealed the word "Montauk", which was the password to get into [https://web.archive.org/web/20120827055415/http://0x10c.com/highnerd/codes.txt another page] on the website, which contained 99 codes which could each be redeemed once on the Mojang website to add ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' to the user’s Mojang account, which would have allowed them to play it as soon as the game was eventually released.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=tpq53|text=I don't know what these accounts will do yet.|author=xNotch|date=May 16, 2012}}</ref> ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' remained part of these users' Mojang accounts until it was eventually removed from the Mojang account system in 2020.

On May 2, 2012, Notch launched an ARG to promote the game. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120629123629/http://psrx0392-15.0x10c.com/ A secret page] on the ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' website read "insufficient power" along with a power percentage. The more people visited this page, the higher the power percentage became until eventually reaching 100%, whereupon [https://web.archive.org/web/20120505144544/http://0x10cwiki.com/arg/dump.html a large amount of garbled code] was revealed, which the community determined represented radio signals from a pulsar.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=t46zk|text=Stay connected to the ARG!|author=dbh937|date=May 2, 2012}}</ref> Discrepancies in the repeating pulsar signals were eventually decoded and revealed to be garbled text taken from Isaac Asimov's short story ''{{w|The Last Question}}'', which, like ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'', also takes place in the extremely distant future of the universe.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=t7ued|cid=c4kcmcc|text=This is from the #0x10c-arg channel on freenode.

Notch also began livestreaming himself coding ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' on Twitch.<ref>{{twl|38122428?filter{{=}}all&sort{{=}}time}}</ref><ref>{{twl|38122416?filter{{=}}all&sort{{=}}time}}</ref> One of the results of this was that viewers were able to copy significant amounts of the code and create a reverse-engineered version of the game.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=vdbkn|text=Trillek / 0x10c Room Editor Demonstration - By Herobrine - YouTube|author=HerobrinesArmy|date=June 21, 2012}}</ref> Notch asked that this not be publicly released, as the game was not yet close to a state he felt comfortable releasing.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=u5pxj|cid=c4sjwom|text=Hah, yeah, it freaked me out a lot until I saw what actually happened.

Originally, Notch intended for the art style of ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' to be mostly textureless, citing the 1993 game ''Frontier'' as inspiration.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308103830/http://0x10.cc/|title=0x10c FAQ}}</ref> However, he later changed his mind, and in September 2012, [[Jonatan Pöljö]], also known as Eldrone, was hired as an artist for the game, and created most of the textures and models seen in the later footage.<ref>{{tweet|notch|251710219133005825|We interviewed @eldrone to work as a 3d artist on 0x10c today and were so impressed we hired him on the spot. He starts Monday.|September 28, 2012}}</ref> According to Eldrone:

{{q|The style is pixel art meets modern 3D. It’s influenced by bright, vivid sci-fi, and real-world functional spaceship design to go with 0x10c’s realistic tone.

The idea is to give people flexible in-game tools for creativity, and have the outcome look fantastic no matter how they piece things together.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102014724/http://0x10c.com/|title=0x10c.com (second version)}}</ref>|Eldrone}}

Progress continued, and eventually, in October 2012, Notch released several videos on YouTube and the ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' website showcasing the progress he had made,<ref>{{ytl|ZkFv-vqpQcE|0x10c Alpha Test #01|Artur Rodrigues|October 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|hmD6R9scsuA|0x10c Alpha Test #02|Artur Rodrigues|October 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20131219192521/http://0x10c.com:80/category/video/</ref> including [https://archive.org/details/0x10c-alpha-tests two physics test videos], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121022043028/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYojT0Xgt9Y&gl=US&hl=en an art test video] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20121031031507/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2k8QBcaaUM&gl=US&hl=en a multiplayer test video]. Eventually, a semi-playable version, featuring a fully modeled and textured spacecraft with an interior and exterior, functional multiplayer and PVP, and the basics of the in-game computer systems, was created, and Notch livestreamed himself battling other Mojang employees onboard the ship.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028081458/http://0x10c.com/2012/10/first-multiplayer-test/|title=First multiplayer test!|website=0x10c.com|author=Owen|date=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

On October 20, 2012, it was announced on the game's website that three ''0x10<sup>c</sup>''-themed shirts were available to purchase from JINX.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023144651/http://0x10c.com/2012/10/now-you-can-wear-0x10c-stuff|title=Now you can wear 0x10c stuff!|website=0x10c.com|author=Owen|date=October 20, 2012}}

Later, on January 21, 2013, Eldrone released a "Facebuilder" demo as a preview of ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'''s player customization system, created in Unity.<ref>{{tweet|eldrone|293286101475532801|Here's a proper download for the facebuilder test: https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.mojang.com/0x10c/facebuilder_test_0.1_win.rar|January 21, 2013}}</ref> This can be found [https://archive.org/details/0x10c-FaceBuilder here].

''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' was eventually put on hold in April of 2013 because Notch had found creative blocks. However, at the time, he was still interested in expanding the development staff to push the game toward release.<ref name=past>{{citation|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/4/5/4183864/minecraft-scrolls-0x10c-the-past-present-and-future-of-mojang-as-seen|title=Minecraft, Scrolls, 0x10c: The past, present and future of Mojang as seen through Notch's eyes|website=Polygon|author=Brian Crecente|date=April 5, 2013}}</ref>

Eventually, on August 13, 2013, Notch announced in a ''Team Fortress 2'' livestream that ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' was indefinitely shelved, but Notch added that it could be made in the future if another Mojang employee was interested in developing it.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816034249/http://www.geek.com/games/notch-indefintely-shelves-mojangs-space-game-0x10c-1565266/|title=Notch indefintely shelves Mojang’s space game, 0x10c|website=Geek.com|author=James Plafke|date=August 13, 2013}}</ref>

On August 19th, Notch wrote on his blog "[[The Word of Notch]]" about his reasons for the game's cancellation:

{{q|What I hadn’t considered was that a lot more people cared about my games now. People got incredibly excited, and the pressure of suddenly having people care if the game got made or not started zapping the fun out of the project. I spent a lot of time thinking about if I even wanted to make games any more. I guess I could just stop talking about what I do, but that doesn’t really come all that natural to me. Over time I kinda just stopped working on it, and then eventually decided to mentally file it as "on ice" and try doing some smaller things. Turns out, what I love doing is making games. Not hyping games or trying to sell a lot of copies. I just want to experiment and develop and think and tinker and tweak.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210703074234/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/58707926941/so-thats-what-im-going-to-do|title=So that’s what I’m going to do.|website=Tumblr|author=Notch|date=August 19, 2013}}</ref>|Notch}}

He then expressed his desire to not become "another under delivering visionary game developer", and said he would instead focus on making "smaller games that can fail" in the future. Regarding ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'', he said that "I want to play this game so much, but I am not the right person to make it. Not any more. I’m convinced a new team with less public interest can make a vastly superior game than what I would make."

On September 15, 2014, following Mojang's acquisition by Microsoft, and Notch's departure from the company, the soundtrack for ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' was released by [[Daniel Rosenfeld]].<ref>[https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/0x10c 0x10c by C418 on Bandcamp]</ref> He stated:

{{q|I worked on it for a bit, but I think Markus thought the game would never be good enough and decided to cancel it. I personally still think the concept and world is brilliant, so I’m bummed out that it doesn’t exist.<ref>https://c418.org/albums/0x10c/</ref>|C418}}

Eldrone would later release images of additional art assets created for ''0x10<sup>c</sup>'' on his Twitter and website.<ref>{{Tweet|eldrone|980479121523437570|Found the art test I made way back when applying for a job at Mojang to work on 0x10c.|April 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>http://www.jonatanpoljo.com/pages/new_9.html</ref>

Some of the known devices and items that were planned for the game include:
===Devices===
*The SPC2000 (Suspension Chamber): a deep sleep cell containing a ZEF882 Time Dilation Field Generator.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130905061002/http://dcpu.com/sleep-chamber/</ref> If a player's generator was intact, they would be able to respawn in a sleep chamber powered by the generator.

If the generator isn't intact, a friend will need to revive you, or you have to wait for everyone to die to respawn the ship.|author=xNotch|date=October 4, 2012}}</ref> The deep sleep cell is a highly illegal device that can accelerate a sphere of matter through the fourth dimension very close to the speed of light. Movement in the fourth spatial dimension will move the traveler between adjacent universes. It speeds up to very high speeds, then counts a number of ticks to calculate how far it's traveled, then slows back down. If the device isn't activated in a vacuum, the result is a large vacuum bubble in each dimension it passes through that implodes very rapidly, causing immense destruction, thus all of the devices come with built-in vacuum detectors and will not work when the ship is docked or in an atmosphere. The chamber is configurable to accelerate to speeds that cause milliseconds, minutes, hours, days or years to pass every few nanoseconds. The players in the game were the first to use this device in active use, and they all wanted to travel for 1 year to reach a star about a lightyear away, but due to an endianness error, they traveled for 0x10<sup>c</sup> years. Nobody found out the problem for two years, so a lot of travelers ended up in this situation. Actual time passed for the traveler was supposed to be a few minutes, but ended up being 10 hours, resulting in them missing their intended target by many miles.<ref>{{reddit2|sub=0x10c|id=10rq4h|cid=c6g3zlg|text=Oh no, this is not a plot hole, this is actually pretty well thought through!|author=xNotch|date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>
