{{relevant tutorial|Advancement guide}}
'''Advancements''' are a way to gradually guide new players into ''[[Minecraft]]'' and give them challenges to complete, similar to the system of [[achievement]]s {{in|be}}.

== Obtaining ==
Advancements can be completed in any [[game mode]], and are obtained and saved per world. Advancements can also be granted (and revoked) using the {{cmd|advancement}} command.

Although advancements guide players logically through the game, they are independent of each other; an advancement can be completed without having completed the advancements "before" it. There are 125 advancements: 16 in the '''Minecraft''' tab, 23 in the '''Nether''' tab, 9 in '''The End''' tab, 47 in the '''Adventure''' tab, and 30 in the '''Husbandry''' tab.

=== Notifications ===
When an advancement is obtained, a sliding [[Toasts|toast]] notification appears in the top right corner. Each notification is accompanied by a [[chat]] message, if the [[game rule]] <code>announceAdvancements</code> is set to <code>true</code> (i.e. enabled). The color of the header text in the notification depends on the advancement; normal and goal advancements have yellow header text, while challenge advancements have pink header text. Completing a normal advancement causes the header text to display "Advancement Made!", completing a goal advancement results in a "Goal Reached!" header, and completing a challenge advancement shows "Challenge Complete!". In addition, [[#Sounds|music plays]] and [[experience]] is rewarded when completing most of these advancements.

Unlike the others, the five "root" advancements in each tab, each of which appears as the left-most advancement in its tab, and have the same name as its tab, do not cause a chat message or notification to appear.

== Interface ==
[[File:AdvancementsInterface.png|thumb|300px|The advancement interface. The "Isn't It Iron Pick" advancement is selected.]]

The button to access the Advancements screen is found on the [[pause menu]] screen. The [[player]] can also open this screen by pressing {{key|L}} (this can be changed in the in-game [[options]] menu).

The advancement system involves several trees composed of advancements, each tree beginning with a root advancement from which several branches diverge. By clicking and dragging, the player can view different branches of an advancement tree. Each tree is categorized into different tabs, defined by the root advancements. Tabs are not visible if no advancements in the tab have been unlocked. There are five tabs in vanilla Minecraft:

* '''[[#Minecraft|Minecraft]]''': The heart and story of the game
* '''[[#Nether|Nether]]''': Bring summer clothes
* '''[[#The End|The End]]''': Or the beginning?
* '''[[#Adventure|Adventure]]''': Adventure, exploration, and combat
* '''[[#Husbandry|Husbandry]]''': The world is full of friends and food

Each tab has a different background with a repeating texture. Tabs appear when at least one advancement in that tab has been made. Tabs are ordered left to right, based on when the first advancement in each tab was made.

Advancement icons display a header name and description when hovered over. The advancement descriptions have a unique color depending on the type of advancement with normal and goal advancements having green descriptions and challenge advancements having purple ones. As more advancements are unlocked, new ones become visible, with up to two advancements being displayed ahead of an unlocked one. Unlocked advancements show all of its '''direct''' parents advancements (the advancements between the root advancement of the tab and it), even those that have not been unlocked (but show only up to 2 advancements downstream of advancements already unlocked). Nine advancements, "How Did We Get Here?", "Voluntary Exile", "Hero of the Village", "Arbalistic", "You've Got a Friend in Me", "Smells Interesting", "Birthday Song", "Little Sniffs", and "Planting the Past" are hidden advancements, meaning that they cannot be viewed by the [[player]] until they have been unlocked, regardless of if its child advancement(s) (any advancement after it, including all branches), if any have been unlocked, which would normally display its parent advancements (as advancements can be unlocked and completed in any order).

If the player has not completed/unlocked any advancements, the interface shows a black background with white text reading "There doesn't seem to be anything here... :("<ref>{{bug|MC-115297|||WAI}}</ref>.

The icon frames of advancements can vary in appearance based on difficulty, and whether or not it was completed. A legend is provided below:

{| class="wikitable" data-description="Advancement icons" style="text-align: center"
! colspan="2" | Icon frame
! rowspan="2" | Description

Extra advancements and tabs can be added and customized with the use of [[Custom advancement|JSON files]] and [[data pack]]s.

== Trivia == 
* Some Minecraft April Fools' Jokes have [[/April Fools'|additional advancements]]. These include:
** [[Java Edition 20w14∞]], which added a new advancement called "Almost there", achieved after going through any portal a billion times. The in-game description is "Visited over billion dimensions." The advancement is found in the "Adventure" tab and its parent is the advancement "Adventure." The advancement also has a flint and steel icon.
** [[Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime]], which added a new advancement called "Ride The End", achieved when an [[ender dragon]] is mounted.
** [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]], which added 2 new advancements called "I Voted!" and "Pro Voter", achieved when the player votes for the first time and for the 256th time, respectively.
** [[Java Edition 24w14potato]], which added an entire tab called "Poisonous Potato Saga" with 24 new advancements, including "Non Plus Ultra" for entering the [[Potato dimension]] for the first time.
** [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine]], which adds 3 new tabs, "Feats", which has 21 advancements (including You Need a Mint), "Unlocks", with 12 advancements, and "Down the Hatch", with 11 advancements, so a total of 43 new advancements (44 if you count You Need a Mint).

* The "Over-Overkill" advancement is a callback-reference to the now removed [[Achievement/Java Edition|achievement]] "Overkill" which required the player to deal 9 hearts of damage in a single hit using any weapon.
* The advancement description of “ Serious Dedication “ seems to be a joke about spending a netherite ingot on a hoe, probably making fun of achievement hunting.
* In ''Java Edition'', advancements [[translation]]s are less strict and allow for creative interpretations, as they are considered more of a 'meta' feature.<ref>{{Cite|title=Minecraft Official Glossary|author=Mojang Studios|website=Google Sheets|date=May 20, 2022|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxDvR2MrPUaxXwNfn-oJX-fBerEsZkfo}}</ref> For instance, the "Free the End" advancement in Pirate English is named "Rip th' big bad bat". These are allowed as long as the translations stay true to the intent of the advancement.
