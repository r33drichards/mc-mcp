The '''Minecraft 1.2 Trailer''' is a trailer for [[Java Edition 1.2.1]].

== Summary ==
The video opens with [[Alsmiffy]] waking [[Trottimus]] and [[djh3max]] out of their [[Bed|beds]] during the [[night]], bashing on the door. Infuriated, they walk down a flight of stairs, and are told "they're coming," referring to an incoming [[zombie siege]]. As several [[Zombie|zombies]] break through the door, they try to escape through an emergency exit, complimenting newly installed [[Redstone Lamp|lights]] along the way. However, the exit [[Explosion|explodes]].

As the three escape out of the building, they quickly arrive at a cliff, as they realize they're on a floating island. As such, the only way out is to jump off. As they fall down, djh3max remarks that they can now build twice as high, before they fall into a [[jungle]]. Discovering an [[ocelot]], they decide to chase after it. Eventually, they happen upon a structure, and decide to enter into a [[dirt]] tunnel, where they set off [[tripwires]]. As zombies continue to chase them, they discover a chamber inside the temple overflowing with [[vines]], accidentally setting off a [[Pressure Plate|pressure plate]], which burns several [[leaves]], revealing a new path.

At the end of the tunnel is a set of [[Piston|pistons]] rigged to create an iron golem, labeled "village defense." With a flick of a lever, however, the mechanism breaks, dropping a [[Carved Pumpkin|pumpkin]]. The zombies still approaching, they figure out how to create the golems, and bring several nearby [[Block of Iron|kits]] to life. The defenses activated, the zombie problem is swiftly resolved, as the camera zooms out of the temple and onto a block built logo for the update.
