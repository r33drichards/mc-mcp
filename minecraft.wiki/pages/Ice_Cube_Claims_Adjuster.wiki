'''Ice Cube Claims Adjuster''' is a series of videos promoting the release of the [[Claims Adjuster Add-On]], starring the musician and actor [[Ice Cube]]. The series revolves around him working as tech support for various {{MC}} players, helping with and/or insulting them for various preventable issues. Throughout each episode are various abstract, surrealist gags reliant on stylized special effects, along with a mutiny of puns and inside jokes.{{TOC limit|3}}

== Campaign ==
{{Expand section}}
Alongside the release of the videos, Minecraft social media accounts initiated a marketing campaign, where fans could get specialized replies by tweeting #CubeClaim and claiming to have an issue with their game. Within just the first day, 28 responses were carried out.<ref>{{Tweet|Minecraft|1956049930310836642|We're gonna not hold your hand when we say this: DENIED}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|Minecraft|1956124810964054378|That’s not a claim… that’s a skill issue.

=== Ice Cube Claims Adjuster ===
{{Infobox video
| image = EXP_Throne.png
| date = August 14, 2025
}}

==== Summary ====
Ice Cube is introduced working in an insurance firm, explained by a singing narrator. As [[Sunny]] is blown up by a [[creeper]], he smacks the side of a computer placed next to his keyboard. A fire transition leads to Ice Cube speaking directly to the viewer, introducing himself and confirming the jingle's claims about him. He promises to "insure your cubes,"  giving examples such as [[Noor]] riding a [[happy ghast]] or [[Makena]] gliding into [[lava]]. He implies sympathy towards the player for dying, before a [[skeleton]], a [[chicken]], and a window of himself crying appear.

Moving on, he promises that players who have lost items are entitled to earn back their property, which a caption asserts they can't. To get a settlement, they need to send Ice Cube a video with #CubeClaim. From there his chair gets propelled into the air by a stream of [[experience]].

=== Claim #5827: Sleeping in the Nether ===
{{Infobox video
| title = Sleeping in the Nether
| image = Denied.png
| date = August 15, 2025
}}

==== Summary ====
Ice Cube is standing on the border between a [[crimson forest]] and [[warped forest]], while sounds of heavy metal screeching play. This segues to the intro, where Ice Cube drinks from a coffee mug over footage of [[piglin brutes]] killing [[Kai]]. [[Larry.exe]] proceeds to load the claim of the day, coming from a player who lost [[diamonds]] from an exploding [[bed]] in [[the Nether]]. Although appearing sympathetic, Ice Cube proceeds to scold the player, insisting the body doesn't need sleep and that it's an illusion.

Going over to a water cooler filled with coffee, he explicitly says that you shouldn't sleep, because he doesn't. The video begins glitching out, as he begins screaming and transforming into a demonic form in a recording booth. He then denies the claim, but as the outro plays, the corrupted visage of Ice Cube reappears.

=== Claim #9573: Going AFK ===
{{Infobox video
| title = Going AFK
| image = Glass denied.png
| date = August 16, 2025
}}

==== Summary ====
Ice Cube screams keys from a keyboard, before [[Zuri]] kills [[Efe]] with a mace over the jingle, which Ice Cube takes delight in. With a voice command, Ice Cube summons Larry.exe, who shows him his claims folder. A player using Zuri says they went away from keyboard for "one second," and got killed by a [[phantom]]. Ice Cube says that this is an amateur move, revealing that he plays without ever leaving his keyboard, achieving this by typing with two boards, with their cables tied around his arms. As Larry speaks out garbled gibberish he types, Ice Cube appears in a glass box, and smashes its window open with the word Denied.

=== Claim #2847: Fell off a Happy Ghast ===
{{Infobox video
| title = Fell off a Happy Ghast
| image = Form Denied.png
| date = August 17, 2025
}}

==== Summary ====
An [[ice]] block is dropped into a forest and onto Ice Cube's head, remarking in his head that it'll hurt in the morning. After the intro, Ice Cube does a reprise of the interaction with Larry from the prior video, except now they make a sarcastic remark. Larry.exe explains that a Noor fell off his happy ghast, "[forgetting] how gravity work!" Ice Cube chooses to teach him a lesson in how it does, pulling a lever that causes him to fall down into a hole, leading from a [[mountain]], into a [[cave]], into [[the Nether]], into a [[warped forest]], and then back to the Ice Cubicle. The lesson of this stunt is "don't mess with gravity," as Ice Cube proceeds to deny the report by breaking a table with a stamp.

=== Claim #6452: Dug Straight Down ===
{{Infobox video
| title = Dug Straight Down
| image = Keyboard denial.png
| date = August 18, 2025
}}

==== Summary ====
Ice Cube beats down on a block of [[wood]] on the floor of his Ice Cubicle, attempting to reach out to Greg downstairs, which works. From there, Kai dies. Ice Cube reveals someone died in ''Minecraft'', seemingly surprised, and pulls up the claim without Larry's help. A player is shown to have decided to dig straight down into [[Grass Block|dirt]] with a [[pickaxe]], and unwittingly fell right into a [[lava]] lake. Ice Cube is quick to condemn this behavior, but explains that if ''he'' dug straight down, he would just land on a soft and secure man named [[Greg]]. Beating down on Larry's keyboard, several keys fall out, spelling denied.

== Trivia ==
* When Sunny is blown up in the first video, if the viewer looks closely they will see creeper [[spawn eggs]], implying Sunny spawned the creeper.
* In the background of the Ice Cubicle, a poster for Ice Cube's Truth to Power tour can be seen.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://icecube.com/fresh-off-hollywood-immortalization-ice-cube-takes-truth-to-the-stage-with-first-coast-to-coast-u-s-tour-in-10-years/icecube_2025_1080x1350_tourposter01c/|title=The Truth to Power Tour|website=Ice Cube|date=April 18, 2025}}</ref>
* Coincidentally, the videos coincided with the release of the film ''{{Wikipedia|War of the Worlds (2025 film)|War of the Worlds}}'', where Ice Cube also happened to play the main character. This caused some to assume the videos were a self parody.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://screenrant.com/minecraft-ice-cube-claims-war-world/|title=Minecraft Starts Weird Crossover With The Worst Movie Of The Year|author=Brandon Key|website=Screen Rant|date=August 15, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/legendary-rapper-ice-cube-is-currently-sitting-at-a-pc-denying-minecraft-compensation-claims/|title=Legendary rapper Ice Cube is currently sitting at a PC denying Minecraft compensation claims|author=[https://www.pcgamer.com/author/rich-stanton/ Rich Stanton]|website=PC Gamer|date=August 18, 2025}}</ref>
* In ''Fell off a Happy Ghast'', a form can be seen written in [[villager]] mumbles, referencing the [[Adjuster]] mob from the add-on.
* The series was created to appeal to nostalgia for infomercials shared between generations.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.campaignlive.com/article/minecraft-akqa-enlist-ice-cube-claims-adjuster/1930214|title=‘Minecraft’ and AKQA enlist Ice Cube as a claims adjuster|author=Kyle O’Brien|website=campaign|date=August 27, 2025}}</ref>
