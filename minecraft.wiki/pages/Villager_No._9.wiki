'''Villager No. 9''' is a character originally appearing in ''[[Villager News]]'', a fan made series of comedic shorts by [[Element Animation]] centered around a news show run by [[villager]]s. Villager No. 9 is the deuteragonist, reporting on events in the village alongside [https://elementanimation.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_Number_4 Villager No. 4] and eventually [[Villager No. 5]].

== Appearance ==
Villager No. 9 resembles a typical [[plains]] villager. In spite of working for Villager News, he lacks any sort of professional overlay. The closest things he has to an identifying trait are a microphone held in his arms at almost all times, and a usually unseen tattoo on his back for identifying himself as part of Villager News.<ref name=":Musical">{{YouTube link|tFPcx4X9-e8|VILLAGER NEWS: BREAKING NEWS! 🎵🎵🎵Minecraft Animated Music Video🎵🎵🎵|Element Animation|April 19, 2024}}</ref>

== Personality ==
Villager No. 9 is a reporter, and so is shown to be committed to sharing information, going very in-depth recounting events.<ref>{{YouTube link|AIdvjx6kDk4|Villager News (Minecraft Animation)|Element Animation|April 26, 2013}}</ref> During especially dangerous scenarios, he has been shown to still willingly go up close to report, such as when a [[creeper]] was grown and gained an explosive force capable of enacting the end of the world. By extension, he has been shown to be relatively brave and heroic, managing to defeat the giant creeper and feed it an antidote by himself.<ref>{{YouTube link|CleUrqPLCzU|VILLAGER NEWS: WAR! (Animation)|Element Animation|September 27, 2019}}</ref> 

However, he has also been shown to be very quick to assume and dismissive, which has led to a citizen becoming traumatized of [[pillager]]s and several villagers dying to a [[creaking]], after insisting that a [[Villager No. 15|villager]] had been lying about it. Worse than that, after coming to terms with the situation, he would try to take credit for the situation, even claiming to have slain the monster.

== Biography ==
In [[VILLAGER (and Pillager?) NEWS]], Villager No. 9 reports on an incident wherein a villager, a white-robed librarian, is presumed to be reluctant to get the [[Village & Pillage]] update. In reality, the librarian is planning to update and tries to explain himself to the crowd, but his words fall on deaf ears as his fellow citizens demand to know why he is against the update. In an attempt to change his mind, the villagers show the librarian a video explaining the new features offered by the update, but instead of enticing him, it has the opposite effect, and the librarian, feeling uncomfortable about the prospect of raids, begins to rethink his decision to get the update. Oblivious to this, Villager No. 9 determines that the librarian is satisfied with the update and segues back to the studio.

In [[Monster in the Woods]], Villager No. 9 would lead an investigative troop into a forest to debunk claims by Villager No. 15, which he was ultimately very skeptical of. Inside the woods, more and more villagers began to slowly disappear, leaving behind their [[drops]]. However, No. 9 refused to believe there was no monster, up to saying there was a wave of hysteria as the other villagers realized they were being culled by the creaking. As the pressure builds, however, he and the cameraman ultimately decide to flee, only returning after escaping from the forest. Now, he fully believes in the story of the creaking, taking credit for the discovery. Infuriated by this, Villager No. 15 would place a [[creaking heart]] inside of a nearby [[pale oak]].

At some point, Villager No. 9 ran an investigation into the [[Overworld]] [[Spring to Life|springing to life]] overnight. Concerned by the appearance of furry [[cow]]s, gray [[chicken]]s, and [[leaf litter]], he attempted to warn the premises of the apparent danger. He then attempts to place the blame on a wandering trader who is dancing nearby, and cautions his fellow citizens to not join in. His warnings go unheard, and soon the whole village is caught up in the dance. Villager No. 9 himself ends up falling victim to the catchy tune, and his fate is left unknown.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Thank you, Villager No. 5! Fellow citizen, why don't you want the update?!|VILLAGER (and Pillager?) NEWS}}{{Quote|Well there you have it, another citizen, SATISFIED, with the update!|VILLAGER (and Pillager?) NEWS}}
{{Quote|No, no! That could have been ANYBODY'S XP! ...And emeralds. And sign that says "I'm Villager No. 31, help me! I'm being attacked by a MONSTER!!" It's circumstantial at best!|Villager No. 9 denying the death of Villager No. 31}}

== Trivia ==
* During the events of "Monster in the Woods", it was believed that Villager No. 9 had been slain by the creaking. However, it has since been confirmed that he managed to survive the encounter, though how he did so is never explained.
