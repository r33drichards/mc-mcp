A '''tipped arrow''' is a type of [[arrow]] that can inflict a [[status effect]] on hit in addition to dealing [[damage]], depending on the [[potion]] used to create it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Picking up arrows===
{{main|Arrow#Picking up arrows}}
Similarly to regular arrows, players can pick up tipped arrows that have been shot by dispensers, or other players in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode. Unlike regular arrows, tipped arrows shot by an [[Infinity]]-enchanted bow can be picked up, as they are not affected by the enchantment.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

=== Villager gifts ===
{{IN|java}}, most tipped arrows can be obtained as a reward item from [[fletcher]] villagers when the player has the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect. Exceptions include arrows of Luck, Slow Falling and Turtle Master.

=== Cauldrons ===
{{main|Cauldron#Holding potions}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, tipped arrows can also be obtained by using arrows on [[cauldron]]s that contain [[potion]]s. The number of tipped arrows created depends on the amount of potion inside a cauldron, which is measured in levels equivalent to {{frac|1|6}} of its maximum capacity, or half of what a [[bottle]] can hold. For every quantity of up to 16 arrows tipped, the amount of potion remaining is reduced by 1 level. However, any potion in the bottom half of a cauldron is only counted as a single level for the purposes of tipping arrows. This means that a maximum of 64 arrows can be tipped from a full cauldron, either at once or in parts. This is more efficient than using lingering potions, as up to 21.33 arrows can be tipped per potion.

== Usage ==
{{main|Arrow#Common properties}}
Tipped arrows share many of the same characteristics as regular arrows as projectiles.

After being in the ground for 600 ticks (30 seconds), a tipped arrow loses its potion effect and becomes a normal arrow.

=== Special properties ===
{{See also|#Crafting}}

Tipped arrows are arrows that imbue a potion effect when hitting a mob or player. The duration of the effect is {{frac|1|8}} that of the corresponding potion, if applicable, and is not affected by the power of the arrow. The status effect is the same as the regular power effect for the potion. If a bow is enchanted with [[Infinity]], tipped arrows are still consumed. 

The types of arrows are:

</div>

Arrows of Harming (and arrows of Healing when used against undead mobs) do not add a static amount of damage to the arrow.<ref>{{bug|MC-107856||Arrows of harming/healing do not stack with bow damage}}</ref> Due to the [[invulnerability timer]] preventing more than one instance of damage from occurring within 10 ticks, the actual damage of an Arrow of Harming is the higher of the arrow's damage and the Harming effect's damage. In the case of [[bow]]s enchanted with [[Power]], from level I to level III this causes the Harming effect to only sometimes improve the arrow's damage against unarmored targets, and level IV and higher prevents the Harming effect from having any tangible effect against unarmored targets. Armored targets may have differing levels of resistances to the arrows and the Harming effect, leading Harming to having more of an effect against such targets.

==== No-effect tipped arrows ====
{{IN|java}}, it is possible to craft tipped arrows using [[Lingering Potion#Lingering water bottle|lingering water bottles]] as well as Awkward, Thick, and Mundane [[lingering potion]]s. If crafted with a water bottle, the arrow is called an arrow of Splashing. If crafted with Mundane, Awkward, or Thick potions, it is called a tipped arrow.<ref>{{bug|MC-158539||Awkward/Thick/Mundane Tipped Arrows use a generic name}}</ref> Tipped arrows crafted from different potions do not stack, as resultant tipped arrows all have different potion tags.

{{IN|bedrock}}, all four kinds as well as the long mundane tipped arrow aren't obtainable either in [[Creative]], by cauldrons, by crafting, or by commands.<!-- do they exist at all? -->

All four kinds generate blue particles in flight and upon landing, but otherwise behave like regular arrows. In particular, arrow of Splashing has no effect on fire and campfires and when shot from a bow with the Flame enchantment, can light candles, campfires and TNT just like regular arrows on fire.

==== Uncraftable tipped arrows ====
{{IN|java}}, the uncraftable tipped arrow is a tipped arrow with no effect that is unobtainable in regular gameplay. It is obtainable using this command: {{cmd|/give @s minecraft:tipped_arrow}}

The uncraftable arrow doesn't differ from regular arrows in behavior when used as a projectile.
