'''''Minecraft: The Island''''' is a map that developed by ''Blockception'' to promote the official ''Minecraft'' novel of the [[Minecraft: The Island|same name]]. It was originally released for [[Realms]] and removed at an uncertain time, but remains available in ''[[Minecraft Education]]''.

== Summary ==

=== The Island ===
The map begins with the player in shallow [[water]], mirroring the opening of the story. On the coast is a [[sign]], labeled "welcome to the Island! Find the [[cave]]!" Said cave is on the opposite side of the island, a downsized replica of [[The Island (location)|the Island]], behind a large hill. The cave consists of a flight of cobblestone stairs, slowly breaking up into [[andesite]] and [[Iron Ore|iron ore]], ending with a much larger cave, where [[Moo]] is trapped in the center of a [[lava lake]]. A series of signs explain the situation, and tell the player to complete five challenges to free her.

Each of the challenges surround the lake, with magma blocks scattered throughout. The first challenge, marked by the number 1 made out of [[Gray Concrete Powder|gray concrete powder]], is a small room. Several items are contained inside of [[trapped chests]], including an [[oak boat]], [[Glass Pane|glass pane]], [[Tulip|pink tulip]], [[Iron Door|iron door]], [[ice]], [[Polished Andesite|polished andesite]], [[pumpkin]], [[Item Frame|item frame]], [[painting]], and [[Planks|spruce planks]]. Nearby the items is a riddle, with the player being expected to place the corresponding item in a [[Shulker Box|yellow shulker box]]. Once the correct item (an item frame) is placed, the challenge will be complete, and a sign will appear, revealing the number 3.

The second challenge is close by, visible by another set of stairs, and is centered around shooting [[Button|buttons]] on [[Redstone Lamp|redstone lamps]] with a [[bow]]. The first three are clearly visible on [[Polished Granite|polished granite]] targets, while the remaining two can be best seen by climbing up to a nearby balcony. Once all five are activated, a [[Stained Terracotta|green terracotta]] 4 will appear in the [[lava]], alongside a sign explaining it's the "first number." The third challenge is a maze inside of a [[mineshaft]], marked by another powder number in the wall. Littered throughout the maze are [[Log|beams]], [[Cobblestone|debris]], and [[Cobweb|cobwebs]], ending with the player pressing a series of [[Stone Pressure Plate|stone pressure plates]]. Upon activation, an exit will appear out a tunnel by a sign, revealing the number 8. The fourth challenge is a parkour course over [[Planks|wooden]] platforms on lava, ending with the final number, 2.

The fifth challenge is a culmination of the previous four challenges, in the form of a machine for inputting the numbers found over the course of the map. Once the combination, 4823, is input, an exit portal will appear, and with it several columns of [[water]], creating a bridge of [[obsidian]] over to Moo. This concludes the storyline of ''the Island''.

=== The Library ===
If the player chooses to enter the portal, the map will thank them for playing, and teleport them to an expansive castle structure. Upon entering, the player will be greeted by a sign pointing towards a portal back to the Island, in front of a library area. Between the entrance and exit portal is a chest, containing an excerpt from [[Minecraft: The Survivors' Book of Secrets|''Minecraft: The Survivors' Book of Secrets'']], with a prompt to find all similar "tips." The second, an excerpt from [[Minecraft: Guide to the Nether & the End|''Minecraft: Guide to the Nether & the End'']], is found not far off, beside a fountain in the center of the library. Surrounding it is a coiling stairway, illuminated by a [[beacon]]'s light, pointing towards the location of the next book. 

Climbing all the way up the stairs will lead to a second floor, predominately consisting of a large [[wool]] [[carpet]]. On the axis of the floor are four, smaller libraries equipped with brewing stands. At the south corner is the third tip, taken from the [[Minecraft: Guide to Survival|''Minecraft: Guide to Survival'']], with the stairs up to the next section of the castle at the west. Above the nooks is a balcony, and above that a series of platforms, decorated with many different bookshelves, which can be reached by climbing up a ladder. In the center of the balcony is a statue of a [[cow]], built off the beacon beam, with the fourth book (quoting the ''[[Minecraft: Guide to Creative]]'') contained underneath it.

The final book is the most obscure, being reachable by climbing a series of [[Barrier|barriers]], marked by [[Torch|torches]]. If that isn't enough, a single [[Wool|red wool]] block is positioned near the first. The path ends with a hole in the ceiling, which segues into a garden, where the player can find [[Flower|flowers]], [[Mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[Stained Glass|glass]] plants. In the center is an artificial birch, housing not a tip, by several pairs of [[elytra]], as well as several signs thanking the player and asking to tweet at ''Blockception'' for their accomplishment.

{{Quote|A beacon is the most expensive investment you're ever likely to make, but the benefits of having one in your base are enormous.

== Trivia ==

* Despite [[oak]] [[Tree|trees]] becoming extinct within the story, there are three at the back of the Island.
** Similarly, Moo is referred to only as "your friend, the Cow" and with masculine pronouns.
*The map was designed to be a nexus for adaptations of other ''Minecraft'' novels, with the Castle hub even having placeholders for their entrances. Although there are other maps based off books, it's unclear if they were ever incorporated into the hub.
*In the time since the map's release, many of the information featured has become inaccurate, even for media outside of the video game. Most notably, the ''Minecraft: Guide to Survival'' is referred to as the ''Minecraft: Guide to Exploration'', its former title.
