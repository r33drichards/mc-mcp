'''1.20.2''' is a minor update to {{JE}}, released on September 21, 2023,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-20-2|Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.2|September 21, 2023}}</ref> which adds the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experiment, the {{cmd|random}} command, [[function (Java Edition)|function]] macros, changes diamond generation, and fixes bugs. It is not compatible with [[Java Edition 1.20|1.20]] – [[Java Edition 1.20.1|1.20.1]] servers.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|random}}'''
* A new command for randomizing values and controlling random sequences.
** Syntaxes:
*** {{cmd|link=none|random (value{{!}}roll) <range> [<sequence>]}}: draw a random value.
*** {{cmd|link=none|random reset (*{{!}}<sequence>) [<seed>] [<includeWorldSeed>] [<includeSequenceId>]}}: control random sequences.
** Arguments:
*** {{cd|range}}: A range of values to randomize between, inclusively. For instance, {{cd|1..6}} is a regular D6 roll.
*** {{cd|sequence}}: The name of a random sequence to sample or reset.
**** In {{cmd|link=none|random reset}}, {{cd|*}} refers to all random sequences.
*** {{cd|seed}}: A seed to use for the random sequence after reset.
*** {{cd|includeWorldSeed}}: A boolean specifying whether to include the world seed when seeding the sequence. Defaults to {{cd|true}}.
**** When {{cd|false}}, it means the sequence evaluates to the same regardless of which world the command is run in.
*** {{cd|includeSequenceId}}: A boolean specifying whether to include the sequence ID when seeding the sequence. Defaults to {{cd|true}}.
**** When {{cd|false}}, it means all sequences evaluate to the same regardless of which name they have.
** {{cmd|link=none|random (value{{!}}roll)}} notes:
*** When using {{cd|roll}} rather than {{cd|value}}, the resulting value is also shown in chat for all players.
*** When {{cd|sequence}} not specified, this command can be executed by players without operator privileges.
** {{cmd|link=none|random reset}} notes:
*** By default, all sequences are seeded as {{cd|d=,|0|true|true}}.
*** Using {{cd|*}} instead of a sequence ID resets all sequences and sets the default parameters.
*** If no seed is specified, the sequence resets to the default parameters.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Added the {{cd|generic.max_absorption}} attribute.
** Acts similar to {{cd|generic.max_health}}, but instead of being the upper bound for {{cd|Health}}, it is the upper bound for {{cd|AbsorptionAmount}}.
** The mob effect {{cd|absorption}} increases {{cd|generic.max_absorption}} as well as fills the {{cd|AbsorptionAmount}} to the max when applied.

'''[[Experiments]]'''
* Added the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experimental toggle ({{cd|trade_rebalance}} data pack).

'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added {{cd|enderPearlsVanishOnDeath}}, controlling whether thrown ender pearls vanish when the player that threw them dies, defaults to {{cd|true}}.

'''[[Loot table]]'''
* Added {{cd|sequence}} loot function.
** Contains 1 field:
*** {{cd|functions}}: an array of sub-functions to run in sequence.
** Can also be declared as an inline array without a type.
*** This matches the existing behavior where loot function JSON files can be declared as an array of composite functions.
* {{cd|all_of}} predicates in loot tables can now be declared implicitly as an inline array without a type.
** This similarly matches the existing behavior where loot predicate JSON files can be declared as an array of sub-predicates.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Narrator Hotkey" option to accessibility settings, opened by default.
** Pressing {{key|Ctrl+B}} doesn't open narrator if it is turned off.

'''<samp>[[options.txt]]</samp>'''
* Added {{cd|narratorHotkey}}, defaults to {{cd|true}}.

'''[[Social interactions]]'''
* Player skins and names can now be reported in the social interactions screen.
** Like chat reports, player skin and name reports are handled by a human.
** If a skin or name is reported, and found to be violating the Community Standards, following actions can be take by Minecraft moderators:
*** Ban the skin from being used by any player.
*** Ban the name from being used by any player.
*** Suspend the player from online play in the case of repeated offences.
** When a skin is banned, players with that skin:
*** Have their skin removed.
*** Are notified when they launch the game.
*** Are automatically assigned one of the default skins.
*** Can still play multiplayer and singleplayer.
*** Can select a new custom skin at any time.
** When a player's name is banned, that player:
*** Needs to choose a new name.
*** Is notified when they launch the game.
*** Is not able to play online until they change their name.
*** Can still play singleplayer.
** A skin or name that has been banned cannot be used by any player in the future.
* Added following report category:
** I want to report them
*** I'm annoyed with them / they have done something I do not like.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the following block tags:
** {{cd|#camel_sand_step_sound_blocks}}: contains {{cd|d=and|#sand|#concrete_powder}}.
** {{cd|#concrete_powder}}: contains all types of concrete powders.
* Added the following damage type tags:
** {{cd|#always_kills_armor_stands}}: contains {{cd|d=and|arrow|trident|mob_projectile|fireball|wither_skull}}.
*** Damage types included in this tag should always fully kill an [[armor stand]].
** {{cd|#no_knockback}}: contains {{cd|d=and|explosion|player_explosion|bad_respawn_point}}.
*** Causes knockback to not be caused by the damage itself. Used in Vanilla for damage that is caused by events, such as explosions, which apply knockback separately.
* Added the following entity tag:
** {{cd|#non_controlling_rider}}: contains {{cd|d=and|slime|magma_cube}}.
*** Represents entities that don't override their vehicles movement control.

== Changes ==

* [[Camel]]s eating cactus now emits an {{cd|eat}} vibration with frequency 8, instead of {{cd|entity_interact}} vibration with frequency 6.

[[File:Smithing Table JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Smithing Table]]'''
* Now in the custom recipes, the upgrade material can be sent to the GUI instantly with the {{key|Shift}} + left click shortcut.

{{Animate|Sponge JE3 BE3.png;Wet Sponge JE2 BE2.png|32px}} '''[[Sponge]] and [[Sponge|Wet Sponge]]'''

* Added {{Cd|powered}} [[block state]].
* No longer check for redstone signals every game tick.

=== Items ===
[[File:Chorus Fruit JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Chorus Fruit]]'''

* Can now collect pollen from [[chorus flower]] or [[spore blossom]].

{{Animate|Camel JE1 BE2.png;Temperate Frog JE1 BE1.png;Goat JE1 BE1.png;Sniffer JE1 BE1.png|50px}} '''[[Camel]]s, [[Frog]]s, [[Goat]]s and [[Sniffer]]s'''
* Now panic when damaged while attached to [[lead]]s.

[[File:Plains Villager Base JE2.png|width=50x50]] '''[[Villager]]s'''
* The discount for curing a villager is no longer multiplied if the villager is reinfected and cured again.
* Now attempt to spawn an [[iron golem]] every 30 seconds instead of 35.

'''General'''
* Changed mob attack reach calculation.
** In horizontal directions, mobs' attack reach are now their bounding box extended in horizontal directions, instead of using horizontal width to determine.
*** For example, a ravager won't be able to attack through a few block thick walls.
** In vertical directions, mobs' attack reach are now the exact vertical range of their bounding box. When there's no overlap between their bounding box and their target's bounding box in vertical direction, they can not attack, in specific:
*** Riding a medium-sized mob (e.g. horse) can get rid of attacks from short mobs (e.g. baby zombie).
*** Riding a tall mob (e.g. camel) can get rid of attacks from standard size mobs (e.g. zombie).
*** Some mob's reaching height now extended (e.g. enderman, safety height changed from 1.5 to 3).

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]] entities'''
* Display entities now start updating their client-side position and rotation on the first tick after an update.
** In previous versions, updates were applied in the same tick, causing uneven motion.
** New behavior is now similar to armor stands, mobs and players.
* On the server, position and rotation are still updated immediately.
* Duration of this interpolation is controlled by the field {{cd|teleport_duration}}.
** {{cd|0}} means that updates are applied immediately.
** {{cd|1}} means that the display entity moves from current position to the updated one over one tick.
** Higher values spread the movement over multiple ticks.
** Please note that this value is clamped to avoid glitches due to periodic position updates.
** The new value applies only to position and rotation changes made after it changed.
*** That means any current movement continues unchanged.
* Note: behavior while riding remains unchanged from previous versions.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* [[Diamond ore]] is now generated more frequently in the [[deepslate]] layers of the Overworld.
** Added a new ore blob placement: Uniform distributed, from height -64 to -4, with blob size 8, generation frequency 2 and a 50% chance of discarding when exposed to air.
** Other existing diamond ore placements remain untouched.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Function (Java Edition)|Function]]s'''
* A single backslash {{cd|\}} as the last non-whitespace character of a line now allows a command to be continued on the next line.
** Leading and trailing whitespace of the following line are stripped before appending.
* Functions can now contain macro lines, making them function macros.
** Any line beginning with {{cd|$}} (as the first non-space character) marks a macro line.
** A macro line also contains one or more substitutions in the form of {{cd|$(variable)}}.
*** Commands with variable substitutions are re-evaluated after substitution.
**** Running commands with this type have extra cost compared to pre-parsed functions.
**** Game attempts to cache the result of certain parameter set being used in a call, to reduce costs when repeatedly calling.
** When calling a function macro a compound with data for all argument variables must be provided.
* Numbers used as macro arguments are now always inserted without suffixes, regardless of numeric type.

'''{{cmd|function}}'''
* Extended command usage, now supported parameters for function macro's variable substitution.
** New syntax: {{cmd|link=none|function <name> [<arguments>{{!}}with (block <sourcePos>{{!}}entity <sou<nowiki/>rce>{{!}}storage <sou<nowiki/>rce>) [<path>]]}}
** New arguments:
*** {{cd|arguments}}: A data compound, enclosed in {{cd|{}}}.
*** Data source: A data source specification, like what could already be used for {{cmd|data get}}.
*** {{cd|path}}: An NBT path specification.
** The data source and {{cd|path}} must specify a compound data entry.
** The compound must contain one entry for each variable used in the macro.
** More data may be present in the compound and if so is ignored.
** Calling a non-macro function with a data compound is silently ignored.
** When a macro is called, the values provided are substituted in place of the variable specifications and the resulting commands are executed.
*** In order to improve performance when repeatedly calling with the same parameter, values in the provided compound which are referenced in macro as parameters are cached.
** Any syntax errors in the lines resulting from variable substitution result in the entire function call being skipped.

'''{{cmd|item}}'''
* Can now replace items in [[jukebox]]es.
* Can now remove items in [[chiseled bookshelves]].

'''General'''
* History of used commands is now saved and accessible across worlds.
** The last 50 commands that are sent in chat are remembered across game sessions.
** The command and chat history can be accessed by pressing {{key|UP}} or {{key|DOWN}} in the chat.
** Regular chat is only persisted within the same game session (leaving a server or world clears them).
** Recent commands are stored in <samp>[[command_history.txt]]</samp> in the <samp>[[.minecraft]]</samp> folder.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The "Smithing with Style" advancement now grants 150 experience upon completion.

'''[[Recipe book]]s'''
* Bamboo fence and bamboo fence gate are now grouped with the other ones.

'''[[Trading]]'''
* When villagers unlock new trades, the order of those trades in the UI is now always random instead of sometimes being deterministic.

=== General ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Clients no longer disconnect themselves when receiving an invalid chat message.
** A placeholder message is instead shown in chat.

'''[[Chunk format]]'''
* Game no longer uses numeric values when storing mob effects to world.
** For example, {{cd|4}} becomes {{cd|minecraft:mining_fatigue}}.
** Changed following fields in mob effect instances:
*** {{cd|Id}} (integer) -> {{cd|id}} (string, resource location)
*** {{cd|Ambient}} -> {{cd|ambient}}
*** {{cd|Amplifier}} -> {{cd|amplifier}}
*** {{cd|Duration}} -> {{cd|duration}}
*** {{cd|ShowParticles}} -> {{cd|show_particles}}
*** {{cd|ShowIcon}} -> {{cd|show_icon}}
*** {{cd|HiddenEffect}} -> {{cd|hidden_effect}}
**** This field is a mob effect instance, so changes to the parent also applied here, recursively.
*** {{cd|FactorCalculationData}} -> {{cd|factor_calculation_data}}
* In NBT format for block entity type {{cd|beacon}}:
** {{cd|Primary}} (integer) -> {{cd|primary_effect}} (string, resource location)
** {{cd|Secondary}} (integer) -> {{cd|secondary_effect}} (string, resource location)

'''[[Chunk tick]]'''
* {{cd|randomTickSpeed}} [[game rule]] now affects the rate of accumulation of [[snow]] and [[ice]] the same way it affects crops and other blocks.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|18}}.
* Added {{cd|decal}} field to armor trim patterns (default: {{cd|false}}).
** If {{cd|true}}, the pattern texture is masked based on the underlying armor.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Values in the {{cd|SH}} row now show up as question marks when playing on a server, instead of wrong values.
* When hitboxes are displayed through {{key|F3+B}}, entities that have a passenger display the passenger's attachment point.
* Renamed "Debug" row to "Debug charts", and changed its style.
** "Pie" chart now called "Profiler" chart.
* The charts on the debug screen can now be toggled with the key combinations {{key|F3+1}} (profiler chart) and {{key|F3+2}} (FPS and TPS) instead of {{key|Shift+F3}} and {{key|Alt+F3}}.
* Press key combination {{key|F3+3}} now shows charts for ping and received network traffic.
* Debug screen no longer be closed while switching charts.
* Multiple charts now can appears at the same time, unless it's conflict with each other.
* Current chart layout is kept when debug screen re-enabled.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* In NBT format for entity type {{cd|mooshroom}}:
** Removed {{cd|d=and|EffectId|EffectDuration}}.
** Added {{cd|stew_effects}}, with the same format as {{cd|effects}} field in {{cd|suspicious_stew}} item format.
* In NBT format for entity type {{cd|area_effect_cloud}}:
** Renamed {{cd|Effects}} to {{cd|effects}}.
* In NBT format for entity type {{cd|arrow}}:
** Renamed {{cd|CustomPotionEffects}} to {{cd|custom_potion_effects}}.
* In NBT format for living entities (players, armor stands, and all mobs):
** Renamed {{cd|ActiveEffects}} to {{cd|active_effects}}.

'''Game events'''
* Added {{cd|entity_action}} game event, to replace {{cd|d=and|entity_roar|entity_shake}}.
* Added {{cd|unequip}} game event.

'''Multiplayer and World Selection screens'''
* Renamed "Cancel" button to "Back".

'''Pack metadata'''
* New features have been added to datapacks and resource packs to allow creation of packs that are compatible with multiple versions of the game.
** Pack metadata now includes an optional field {{cd|supported_formats}} which describes a range for pack formats that this pack supports.
*** Examples: {{cd|16}}, {{cd|[16,17]}}, {{cd|{"min_inclusive": 16, "max_inclusive": 17}}}
** {{cd|pack_format}} field is still required and its format remains unchanged, to allow older game versions to read pack data.
*** If {{cd|supported_formats}} is present, it must contain the value declared in {{cd|pack_format}}.
*** Since this new information is ignored by older versions of the game, they always see a "normal", single-version pack, without any extended compatibility.
* Packs can now contain overlay directories ("overlays").
** Overlays are sub-packs applied over the "normal" contents of a pack.
*** These directories have the same layout as the top-level pack, including the {{cd|assets}} and {{cd|data}} directories.
*** Overlays can be applied if they support the client's pack format.
*** Overlays can add and replace files, but not remove them.
**** For example, if the overlay {{cd|foo}} is applied, the file {{cd|foo/assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png}} replaces contents of {{cd|assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png}}.
*** {{cd|pack.mcmeta}} and {{cd|pack.png}} are ignored in overlay directories.
** New section called {{cd|overlays}} have been added to pack metadata.
*** It contains an {{cd|entries}} field, containing a list of overlays.
*** Every overlay entry has two fields:
**** {{cd|formats}} - range of supported formats
**** {{cd|directory}} - overlay directory (allowed characters: {{cd|d=and|a-z|0-9|_|-}})
** Order of application: overlays are stacked from the bottom to top of the list.
*** For example, if a pack has two overlays: {{cd|"entries": [{"directory":"A", ...}, {"directory":"B", ...}]}}, the game first looks in B, then A, and then in the top pack directory.

'''[[player.dat format]]'''
* In NBT format for item type {{cd|d=and|potion|lingering_potion|splash_potion|tipped_arrow}}:
** Renamed {{cd|CustomPotionEffects}} to {{cd|custom_potion_effects}}.
* In NBT format for item type {{cd|suspicious_stew}}:
** Renamed {{cd|Effects}} to {{cd|effects}}, also changed following fields in this field:
*** {{cd|EffectId}} (integer) -> {{cd|id}} (string, resource location)
*** {{cd|EffectDuration}} -> {{cd|duration}}

'''Protocol'''
* Optimized the way chunks are sent to clients to allow players with low-bandwidth internet connections to play on multiplayer servers.
** Chunks are no longer sent over the network to the client in one big continuous batch.
** They are instead sent in smaller batches depending on the available bandwidth. This means that:
*** Clients with extremely low-bandwidth connections don't time out while loading the world.
*** Clients with low-bandwidth connections can interact with the world while some chunks are still loading.
** Only chunks within the client's render distance are now sent.
** Gameplay packets are now packed into bigger TCP-packets to reduce overhead from TCP-headers, significantly reducing network usage.
* Changed network protocol to allow for more data-driven content in the future.
** Configuration phase automatically starts after login phase (i.e. after client account has been verified) and lasts until the player joins the world (play phase).
** Clients can stay in configuration phase indefinitely - it's up to server to release it to the world.
** Servers can also request clients to re-enter the configuration phase after it has entered the play phase.
*** Other players see such clients as disconnected.
** Users in configuration phase aren't visible on the player list.
** Actions allowed in configuration phase (moved from play phase).
*** Configuration of data-driven registries.
*** Configuration of enabled features.
** Actions shared between configuration and play phases:
*** Application of server resource packs.
*** Update of tags.
*** Exchange of custom packets.
*** Ping and keep-alive packets.
** The server now negotiates resource pack in the configuration phase.
*** This means that the player is no longer in world when answering prompts and reloading resources.
* Client options are now sent during the configuration network phase when joining a server.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|18}}.
** The process of upgrading a pack can be assisted by using an automated Slicer tool.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1</ref>
** All textures containing multiple sprites in a sheet for GUI have been split into individual sprites under {{cd|textures/gui/sprites}} (automated by Slicer tool).
** All textures in the {{cd|realms}} namespace have been moved into the {{cd|minecraft}} namespace (automated by Slicer tool).
** {{cd|villager2.png}} has been renamed to {{cd|villager.png}} (automated by Slicer tool).
** {{cd|icon/trial_available}} and {{cd|realm_status/expires_soon}} GUI sprites are animated with {{cd|.mcmeta}} declarations instead of individual sprites (automated by Slicer tool).
** The bundle tooltip background is now drawn as a nine-sliced sprite.
** The icons for the "Accessibility", "Language", and "Realms News" buttons have been split from their underlying button texture.
** The "Realms Invite" button is now drawn as an overlay on the normal button texture.
*** The highlighted texture state for this button has been removed.
** The highlighted states for Realms invitation number icons have been removed.
** The exclamation marks on the {{cd|notification\more.png}} have been removed.
** The text field background is now a nine-sliced sprite at {{cd|d=and|widget/text_field|widget/text_field_highlighted}}.
** The scroll bar in lists and text fields is now a nine-sliced sprite at {{cd|widget/scroller}}.

'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* The {{cd|belowName}} display slot selector is now {{cd|below_name}}.

'''[[server.properties]]'''
* Added new {{cd|log-ips}} option (defaults to {{cd|true}}).
** When set to {{cd|false}}, prevents player IPs from being included in the log when players join the game.

'''[[Social interactions]]'''
* Changed following reporting categories:
** Defamation<del class="tc-no">, impersonation, or false information</del>
*** Someone is damaging <ins class="tc-yes">your or</ins> someone else's reputation, <del class="tc-no">pretending to be someone they're not, or</del> <ins class="tc-yes">for example</ins> sharing false information with the aim to exploit or mislead others.
** <del class="tc-no">Imminent harm - </del>Self-harm or suicide
*** Someone is threatening to harm themselves in real life or talking about harming themselves in real life.
** <del class="tc-no">Imminent harm - </del>Threat <del class="tc-no">to</del> <ins class="tc-yes">of</ins> harm <ins class="tc-yes">to</ins> others
*** Someone is threatening to harm you or someone else in real life.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Moved all types of concrete powders to newly added block tag {{cd|#concrete_powder}} from {{cd|#mineable/shovel}} block tag, then added {{cd|#concrete_powder}} to {{cd|#mineable/shovel}}.
* Removed {{cd|d=and|entity_roar|entity_shake}} from {{cd|d=and|#vibrations|#warden_can_listen}} game event tags, then added {{cd|d=and|entity_action|unequip}} to them.
* Added {{cd|d=and|chorus_flower|spore_blossom}} to {{cd|#flowers}} block and item tags.

'''[[Telemetry]]'''
* Added a button to the telemetry data collection screen that links to the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

'''General'''
* The LWJGL library has been upgraded to version 3.3.2.
* The default Java version shipped with the game has been upgraded to Microsoft OpenJDK 17.0.8.
* Added validation for symbolic links in datapacks and resource packs, to improve safety.
** This feature expands on symbolic link validation in worlds added in the previous release.
** The game now warns users if a pack added via drag and drop contains disallowed symbolic links.
** Packs containing disallowed symbolic links are not visible in UI and commands.
** Additionally, directories and files that are not recognized as packs are no longer copied via drag and drop.

* Increases the chance of generating enchanted books with [[Quick Charge]] (level I to III).

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Trading]]'''
* Changed the trading mechanism of librarians selling enchanted books.
** Instead of offering every possible enchanted book, librarians are now offering specific enchanted books depending on which biome they come from.
*** Jungle and swamp villages do not generate naturally. Thus, players must breed villagers or cure zombie villagers in these biomes to access their trades.
** All tradable enchanted books now split to special books and normal books.
*** Special books have a specific enchantment with a fixed level, and are only available from master librarians with full XP.
*** Normal books have a specific enchantment without a fixed level, just like before.
** All enchantments used for [[crossbow]], [[fishing rod]], and [[trident]] are removed from trading.

** The savanna armorer sells cursed diamond armor at reduced prices.
** The taiga armorer can swap one piece of diamond armor for another.
