'''1.21.100''' is a minor update for ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' released on August 5, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-100-bedrock-changelog|title=Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.100 Update|website=minecraft.net|date=August 5, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/update1.21.100?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Minecraft Bedrock 1.21.100 Update Notes for Creators|website=Microsoft Learn|date=August 7, 2025}}</ref> which adds "The Void" [[flat world]] preset, experimental features for [[The Copper Age]], and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[Target selectors]]'''
*Added the {{cd|@n}} target selector, which returns the single closest entity.
'''[[Spawn event]]'''
* Added two new spawn events: {{Cd|code=minecraft:entity_spawned_with_default_jockey}} and {{Cd|code=minecraft:entity_spawned_with_biome_specific_jockey}}.
** Both of them are only executable on spiders and cave spiders.
** {{Cd|code=minecraft:entity_spawned_with_default_jockey}} lets spiders and cave spiders spawn as a spider jockey with a skeleton rider, if it's nighttime or underground.
** {{Cd|code=minecraft:entity_spawned_with_biome_specific_jockey}} lets spiders and cave spiders spawn with a skeleton variant rider depending on the biome they spawn in, if it's nighttime and not underground.
*** It adds a [[wither skeleton]] rider in The Nether.
*** It adds a [[stray]] rider in snowy biomes.
*** It adds a [[bogged]] rider in swamp or mangrove swamp biomes.
*** If executed anywhere else or underground, it adds a regular skeleton rider.

=== General ===
'''[[Accessibility]]'''
*Added screen narrator enumeration to UI buttons when adding a new server.

'''[[Flat]] world presets'''
*Added "The Void" as a flat world preset.

== Changes ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[World spawn]]'''
*The world spawn can now be set in [[The End]] using {{cmd|spawnpoint}}.

'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
*{{cmd|locate biome}} command now requires that the biome's namespace is specified (ex: {{cd|minecraft:plains}} instead of just {{cd|plains}}). Auto-complete suggestions for this command will now include namespaces.

=== Items ===
'''[[Lead]]'''
*Leashes now emit their breaking sound from the location of the leash holder, rather than the entity being leashed.

=== Entities ===
====Mobs====
'''[[Animal]]s'''
*The ambient sound interval for all animals has been adjusted to 6 seconds, matching {{JE}}.

'''[[Cave Spider]]'''
* When spawning as a spider jockey in swamp or mangrove swamp biomes, it now has an 80% chance to have a bogged rider.

'''[[Enderman]]'''
* Endermen can now pick up all block types they can in {{JE}}.

'''[[Ghast]]s'''
*The ambient sound interval for all ghasts has been adjusted to 4 seconds, matching {{JE}}.

'''[[Happy Ghast]]'''

*Increased volume of happy ghast ride sound.

'''[[Piglin Brute]]'''
*It now despawns properly in [[Difficulty#Peaceful|peaceful difficulty]].

'''[[Spider]]'''
* When spawning as a spider jockey in swamp or mangrove swamp biomes, it now has an 80% chance to have a bogged rider.

'''[[Spider Jockey]]'''
* Now can be summoned with the command during nighttime or underground: {{cmd|summon spider ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:entity_spawned_with_default_jockey}}.

====[[Projectile]]s====
'''[[Snowball]]s, [[Ender Pearl]]s, [[Ender Eye]]s, [[Experience Bottle]]s, [[Splash Potion]]s, [[Lingering Potion]]s, and [[Ice Bomb]]s'''
* Their sprites, when rendered in the world, now have the correct scaling and positional offset.
* They now match {{JE}}, and also match better with their collider.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death]]'''
*Enabled engine changes to mob death behavior. This refactor shouldn’t affect gameplay.

'''[[Hotbar]]'''
*Hotbar can always be hit on any touch device. The detection area matches the texture even if you have customized controls enabled.

'''[[Leash]]ed mobs'''
*Updated the way leashed mobs interact with [[Riding|vehicles]].
**Leashed mobs can now be pulled into [[boat]]s, [[minecart]]s, and other rideable entities if the leash is slackened when close to those entities.
**Leashed mobs will now automatically dismount their vehicle if the leash is stretched far enough.

=== General ===
{{Missing information|section|Changes to marketplace-related menus}}
'''Graphical'''
*Added a new [[Screen effects|camera effect]] when facing and climbing blocks such as [[ladder]]s and [[vine]]s, to reduce eye strain and improve accessibility.
*[[Sugar cane]] blocks will now become slightly transparent when the camera passes through them.
*[[Item (entity)|Items]] dropped in first-person view appear slightly higher, without affecting the actual item position.

'''[[Settings]]'''
* Moved the graphics mode and render distance options to the top of the video settings for convenience.
* Added preview sounds for the new audio tab.

'''[[UI]]'''
*"Owned" or "Download" is now displayed on items the player owns outside of the "My Library" page.

*Updated Marketplace Pass chevron to show on items in the inventory.
*Moved the "Owned"/"Download" text to the right side.
*Made some adjustments to the spacing of items in the settings menu.

=== Graphical ===
'''[[Vibrant Visuals]]'''
* Weather events now affect the scene illumination and the color of clouds and sky in Vibrant Visuals.
* Updated Reflections configurations for "Favor Performance" presets on Xbox platforms with Vibrant Visuals.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Tree]]s'''
*Trees now generate more sparsely in [[grove]]s.
*Trees now generate more frequently in [[snowy plains]].

'''[[Frozen Ocean]]'''
*Its surface is no longer entirely covered by ice, and now features patches of open water.
*Icebergs in frozen ocean biomes now generate with a shape and frequency that more closely matches {{JE}}.

'''[[Deep Frozen Ocean]]'''
*Its surface is no longer covered by ice and now consists entirely of open water.

'''[[Old Growth Spruce Taiga]] and [[Old Growth Pine Taiga]]'''
*Increased the size of the [[podzol]] patches generated beneath mega pines and mega [[spruce]]s.
**This change affects both world generation and trees grown by players.

'''[[Mushroom]]s'''
*Mushrooms now properly generate under trees in [[swamp]]s and other biomes where they naturally generate.

'''[[Seagrass]]'''
*Seagrass no longer pokes through [[ice]] when it generates in shallow [[water]] in biomes that have ice on the water's surface.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Add-On]]s and Script Engine'''
*Custom biome names are no longer implied by their filenames. Biome names are explicitly specified via the {{cd|identifier}} property under the {{cd|description}} sub-object of their JSON definition.
*Biome identifiers must now be namespaced (ex: {{cd|minecraft:plains}}). Client biomes with a format version lower than 1.21.90 will have their identifier automatically prefixed {{cd|minecraft:}} when loaded if no namespace is already specified.
*Updated biome documentation to match updated biome JSON formatting and requirements.
*Biomes client settings now look up settings based on the biome's full name, including its namespace. Vanilla biomes will fall back on their name without a namespace if an exact match is not found before falling back on default settings (for example, {{cd|minecraft:plains}} will match itself, then {{cd|plains}} if no setting was found)

'''AI Goals'''
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.take_block}} AI goal, allows an entity to take blocks from the world with the following options:
**{{cd|blocks}}: Array of block descriptors that the entity can take, if empty can take any block.
**{{cd|can_take}}: Entity filters for when the entity can use the goal.
**{{cd|on_take}}: Trigger ran if the entity does take a block.
**{{cd|xz_range}}: XZ range from which the entity will try and take blocks from.
**{{cd|y_range}}: Y range from which the entity will try and take blocks from.
**{{cd|chance}}: Chance each tick to try and take a block.
**{{cd|affected_by_griefing_rule}}: If the goal is affected by the mob griefing game rule.
**{{cd|requires_line_of_sight}}: If the entity requires line of sight on the block it tries to take.
*Removed the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block}} AI goal, it upgrades to the above goal.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.place_block}} AI goal, allows an entity to place blocks in the world with the following options:
**{{cd|placeable_carried_blocks}}: Array of block descriptors that the entity can place if its carried item, if empty can place any block from its carried item.
**{{cd|randomly_placeable_blocks}}: Array of weighted block descriptors that the entity can randomly place, if empty the entity will try to place the block in its carried item instead.
**{{cd|can_place}}: Entity filters for when the entity can use the goal.
**{{cd|on_place}}: Trigger ran if the entity does place a block.
**{{cd|xz_range}}: X range from which the entity will try and place blocks in.
**{{cd|y_range}}: Y range from which the entity will try and place blocks in.
**{{cd|chance}}: Chance each tick to try and place a block.
**{{cd|affected_by_griefing_rule}}: If the goal is affected by the mob griefing game rule.
*Removed the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.enderman_leave_block}} AI goal, it upgrades to the above goal.

'''[[API]]'''
*The {{cd|message}} parameter of the {{cd|setText}} method on {{cd|BlockSignComponent}} no longer accepts a {{cd|RawText}} as an option. This option was redundant as it is covered by the existing {{cd|RawMessage}} option. This affects the {{cd|setText}} method in all versions.
*Updated many error strings to use consistent punctuation.
*The properties {{cd|minValue}} and {{cd|maxValue}} on the {{cd|ArgumentOutOfBoundsError}} class are now optional.
*Updated several APIs to throw {{cd|ArgumentOutOfBoundsError}} instead of {{cd|Error}} where appropriate. This affects the following APIs in all versions:
**{{cd|Entity.addEffect}} for when the {{cd|amplifier}} setting is out of bounds (0 - 255) or {{cd|duration}} setting is out of bounds (1 - 20000000).
**{{cd|Entity.applyImpulse}} for when the {{cd|vector}} parameter is out of bounds (-1000 - 1000 per axis).
**{{cd|ItemStack.setLore}} and {{cd|ContainerSlot.setLore}} for when the {{cd|loreList}} parameter is out of bounds (0 - 100 max lines, 0 - 1000 max length per line).
**{{cd|ItemStack.setAmount}} and {{cd|ContainerSlot.setAmount}} for when the {{cd|amount}} parameter is out of bounds (0 - 255).
*Some existing errors that throw {{cd|ArgumentOutOfBoundsError}} have been updated to use a standardized error message. This affects the following APIs in all versions:
**{{cd|ScreenDisplay.setTitle}} for when the {{cd|fadeInDuration}}, {{cd|stayDuration}} or {{cd|fadeOutDuration}} settings are out of bounds (min value of 0).
**{{cd|StructureManager.placeStructure}} for when the {{cd|integrity}} setting is out of bounds (0 - 1).
**{{cd|PlayerAimAssist.setAimAssistSettings}} for when the {{cd|viewAngle}} setting is out of bounds (10 - 90) or {{cd|distance}} setting is out of bounds (1 - 16).
**{{cd|ItemStack.setNameTag}} and {{cd|ContainerSlot.setNameTag}} for when the {{cd|nameTag}} parameter length is out of bounds (0 - 255).
*Some existing errors that throw {{cd|InvalidArgumentError}} have been updated to use a standardized error message.
**{{cd|CustomSpawnRulesRegistry.registerObstructionCallback}} for when the {{cd|predicate}} parameter is empty or a duplicate.
*Released {{cd|DyeableItemComponent}} to {{cd|stable}}.
*Removed {{cd|minecraft:destruction_particles}}'s block API from {{cd|beta}}, it was deemed too risky to expose to server scripting API since the component is only being used on client.
*Moved enum {{cd|MovementType}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.0.0}}.
*Moved enum {{cd|StickyType}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.0.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|BlockMovableComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.0.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|localizationKey}} property on {{cd|Block}}, {{cd|Entity}}, {{cd|Dimension}}, and {{cd|ItemStack}} from {{cd|beta}} into {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|Container}} methods {{cd|contains}}, {{cd|firstEmptySlot}}, {{cd|firstItem}}, {{cd|find}}, and {{cd|findLast}} from {{cd|beta}} into {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Added new error class {{cd|UnsupportedFunctionalityError}} which is thrown for certain cases where a particular functionality such as a method, or part of a method based on the parameters, is not supported. An example is calling the {{cd|Entity}} method {{cd|remove}} on a player.
*Added new error class {{cd|EntitySpawnError}} which is thrown when an entity fails to spawn via the {{cd|spawnEntity}} method on {{cd|Dimension}}.
*Updated many methods to throw custom errors to provide better context and information of the problem that occurred.

'''[[Biome]]s'''
*Updated {{cd|minecraft:grass_appearance}} component with {{cd|grass_is_shaded}} variable if {{cd|true}} it adds a shading effect to the grass as if there was a roof.

'''[[Block]]'''
*{{cd|alpha_test_to_opaque}}, {{cd|alpha_test_single_sided_to_opaque}}, and {{cd|blend_to_opaque}} will now shift to {{cd|opaque}} in the distance again when used as render method in {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}}.
*Removed Upcoming Creator Features toggle requirement from Movable Component.
*Released the component {{cd|minecraft:random_offset}} from experimental for block format versions 1.21.100 or higher.
*Blocks with improperly configured textures will now show additional content errors.
*Released the particle count field for the block destruction particles component out of experimental.

'''Block Components'''
*Modified {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component.
**Field {{cd|uv_lock}} no longer requires Upcoming Creator Features experiment to work. JSON {{cd|format_version}} still needs to be >= {{cd|1.21.90}}.

'''Components'''
*Content warnings will log missing entity references in {{cd|Spawn Rule}} JSON.
*Content warnings will log missing references in {{cd|Client Biome}} JSON.
*The {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_axis_aligned}} component has been renamed to {{cd|minecraft:rotation_axis_aligned}}.
*Content warnings will log missing references in Jigsaw Structure, Processor List, Template Pool, and Structure Sets JSON.

'''Entity Components'''
*Made the schema for the {{cd|minecraft:tick_world}} entity component stricter so that the parsing now refuses out of range values for {{cd|radius}} and {{cd|distance_to_players}}.

'''Graphical'''
*Changed cloud quality to player visible option and not a dev only option.
*Fishing Line: Increased thickness in Vibrant Visuals mode, so that the fishing line does not disappear from TAA.
*Reduced the alpha value from 60% to 25% for hurt color overlay on entities to aid in accessibility.
*Caustics textures with incorrect dimensions will no longer be loaded; a content error will be issued and the default caustics texture will be used instead.

'''[[Jigsaw]]'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:blockstate_match}} and {{cd|minecraft:random_blockstate_match}} rules to jigsaw processors.
*Added heightmap projection type {{cd|none}} and made it the default setting, which instead of performing heightmap calculations uses the starting placement position.

'''[[Molang]]'''
*{{cd|query.is_carrying_block}} is now usable by all entities, not just enderman.
*{{cd|query.is_carrying_block}} returns 1.0 if the entity is carrying any block, including air.

'''[[Texture]]s'''
*Modified Json parsing of {{cd|variations}} texture objects in {{cd|terrain_texture.json}} files:
**{{cd|weight}} field clamped to minimum value of 0.05.
**{{cd|weight}} field clamped to maximum value of 1000000.

'''[[File:Copper_Golem_Spawn_Egg_JE1_BE1.png|class=pixel-image|width=32x32]] [[Copper Golem Spawn Egg]]'''
* Used to spawn a [[copper golem]].

==== Mobs ====
'''[[Copper Golem]]'''
*Drops 1 to 3 [[copper ingot]]s when killed.
*It can help with sorting items into chests.
*If it is not holding an item, it will look for a nearby [[copper chest]]s and pick up items from that chest.
*It can pick up max 16 items in a stack at the time.
*Any item in a copper chest can be picked up.
*If it is holding an item, it will look for nearby wooden [[chest]]s to try to place the item into.
*It can only place an item in a chest if the chest is empty or contains the same type of item the golem is holding in its hand.
*It will visit a max of 10 copper chests when looking for items to pick up, and a max of 10 chests when looking for somewhere to put the items.
*If no matching chest is found the copper golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again.
*The search area for chests from the copper golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks.

==== Technical ====
'''AI Goals'''
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.transport_items}} AI goal, allows a mob to transport items from and to containers.
**Description:
***If the mob is not carrying an item it will try to find a container matching {{cd|source_container_types}} and will attempt to take an item from the first non-empty slot. It will take the largest of {{cd|max_stack_size}} and the size of the stack in that slot. If the container is empty or it does not find a match it will remember this container as visited and search for the next container from which to pick up an item. If it fails to find an unvisited container from which to pick up items it will disable the goal for {{cd|idle_cooldown}} seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has picked up an item it resets what containers it has visited.
***If the mob is carrying an item it will try to find a container matching {{cd|destination_container_types}} and attempt to put its carried item in it. It will put as much of the carried item as possible into the container. If it is still carrying an item (the container is full) it will remember the container as visited and try to find the next container to put items in. If it fails to find an unvisited container in which to put items it will disable the goal for {{cd|idle_cooldown}} seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has stored items and is empty handed again it resets what containers it has visited.
***If at any point the target container becomes an invalid target (the block could be removed or a chest could have a cat sit on it for example), the mob will mark the position as visited and move to the next target.
**Fields:
***{{cd|source_container_types}}: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to get items from. Default is any container.
***{{cd|destination_container_types}}: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to put items in. Default is any container.
***{{cd|max_stack_size}}: The maximum stack size that the mob will try to take from a container. Default is 16.
***{{cd|interaction_time}}: The amount of time spent interacting with the containers in seconds. Default is 3.0.
***{{cd|allow_simultaneous_interaction}}: Whether the entity is allowed to simultaneously interact with a container that another non-player entity is already interacting with. Default is {{cd|false}}.
***{{cd|search_strategy}}: Whether to select the nearest valid container or a random valid container in range. valid values are {{cd|nearest}} or {{cd|random}} (default).
***{{cd|search_distance}}: The maximum horizontal and vertical distance at which to find containers for taking or placing items. Default {{cd|[62, 32]}}.
***{{cd|max_visited_containers}}: The maximum number of containers the mob will visit before resetting. 0 is unlimited and default is 16.
***{{cd|initial_cooldown}}: Time, in seconds, the mob will wait after spawning or after its available goals have changed (e.g. due to a component group update). Default is 0.
***{{cd|idle_cooldown}}: When the mob cannot find a valid container to interact with, the goal will be disabled for this amount of time in seconds. Default is 20.
***{{cd|place_strategy}}: governs which container contents the goal is allowed to add to:
****{{cd|with_matching}}: Only allows placing item in a container already having stack(s) of item.
****{{cd|with_matching_or_empty}}: Like the above, but additionally allows placement in empty containers.
****{{cd|any}}: Puts no restriction, allows placement of item in container as long as there is space. This is the default behavior.
***{{cd|allowed_items}}: A list of item descriptors that are the only items the mob is allowed to transport. If non-empty {{cd|disallowed_items}} must be empty. Default is {{cd|empty}} (all items allowed).
***{{cd|disallowed_items}}: A list of item descriptors that are the mob is not allowed to transport. If non-empty {{cd|allowed_items}} must be empty. Default is {{cd|empty}} (no items disallowed).
**Requirements and limitations:
***Initially the component requires the 2025 Drop 3 experiment to be enabled but it will be generally available in a later update.
***A navigation component is needed to enable the mob to navigate to the container. E.g. {{cd|minecraft:navigation.walk}}
***At the moment chests, copper chests, barrels, and shulker boxes are the only supported containers.

'''API'''
*Added class {{cd|InvalidItemStackError}} to {{cd|beta}}.
*Added {{cd|runOnFinish}} method to {{cd|GameTest}} which runs after the test is completed, regardless if it passed, failed, or timed out.
*Added class {{cd|ItemBookComponent}} to {{cd|beta}} for interfacing with {{cd|minecraft:writable_book}} and {{cd|minecraft:written_book}} to change their contents and sign them.
*Added class {{cd|BookError}} and class {{cd|BookPageContentError}} to {{cd|beta}}.
*Added {{cd|setFov}} with {{cd|CameraFovOptions}} parameter. This can be used to modify the FOV of the current camera.
**Added class {{cd|LootTableManager}} to {{cd|beta}}, which allows for generation of loot from entities and blocks.
*Added easing options for clearing a custom FOV. Clearing without valid easing values will instantly clear the custom FOV value.

'''Biomes'''
*Added a new server side biome component {{cd|surface_builder}} that will combine the components {{cd|surface_parameters}}, {{cd|frozen_ocean_surface}}, {{cd|mesa_surface}}, {{cd|swamp_surface}}, {{cd|capped_surface}}, and {{cd|the_end_surface}} into one component. Each biome can only use one builder type. The component can be used for world generation settings such as foundation material and sea floor depth.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:humidity}} component with {{cd|is_humid}} this forces a biome to either always be humid or never humid. Humidity effects the spread chance, and spread rate of fire in the biome.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:partially_frozen}} This component will impact the temperature in a frozen biome, causing some areas to not be frozen. Ex: patchy ice, patchy snow.

'''[[Commands]]'''
*Added the {{cd|fov_set}} keyword to the {{cmd|camera}} command for changing the camera's field of view. Enabled with the Experimental Creator Camera toggle.

'''Scripting'''
*Added support for text to speech for tooltips at Server-UI forms.

'''UI'''
*Added support for navigation using keyboard and gamepad for tooltips at settings. Also, to be showed always inside the visible area. Mobile resolutions were having issues with this.

*Class {{cd|ModalFormDataTextFieldOptions}}.
**Field {{cd|defaultValue}} type changed from {{cd|string}} to {{cd|minecraftserver.RawMessage | string}}.

'''[[Experiment]]al'''
*{{cmd|locate structure}} command (and similar structure-searching gameplay elements) will now quickly return no result if experimental Custom Biomes have replaced all of the biomes where that structure could appear.

'''Gameplay'''
*When loading a chunk that used a removed custom biome, the removed biome is now replaced with the dimension's default biome, which is ocean in the Overworld.

'''Jigsaw'''
*{{cd|max_distance_from_center}} now parses horizontal and vertical values separately in an object while supporting horizontal only with parsing as a constant, the vertical value is now optional and defaults to having no limit.
*Changed structure definitions folder from {{cd|worldgen/jigsaw_structures}} to {{cd|worldgen/structures}}.

'''World generation'''
*Mixing Terrain matching and Rigid Structures will no longer sink rigid structure 1 block.
*Chunks will no longer infinitely load when multiple structures are used within a structure set.
*Can now use {{cd|minecraft:empty_pool_element}} jigsaw template pools to represent empty elements.
