=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Some minor terrain changes.{{more info}}

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Enchantment system has been rebalanced.
** The maximum enchantment level has been lowered from 50 to 30.
*** As a result enchantment tables now require only 15 bookcases around them to allow maximum level enchantments.
** With a full [[enchantment table]] set with [[bookshelves]], at the bottom of the 3 enchantments, it always shows the player the highest number possible.
** Using level 30 enchantments, the player has a lot more luck; almost all items get at least 2 enchantments.
** Various actions now reward the player with [[experience orb]]s, such as mining [[ore]]s (except [[gold ore]] and [[iron ore]]), using [[furnace]]s, and getting [[achievement]]s.
** Levels are now awarded linearly. It takes 17 [[experience]] to go up one level.

'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Blocks seen in inventory are oriented to the right instead of to the left.

'''[[Nether portal]]s'''
* Have a very small chance of spawning [[zombie pigmen]].

'''[[Singleplayer]]'''
* Pausing now works again in singleplayer.

'''[[Smelting]]'''
* Smelting in a furnace with a lava bucket now leaves an empty [[bucket]] for the player to retrieve.

'''Villager [[trading]]'''
* Added the 10 gravel + 1 emerald → 2-3 flint trade to farmers.
* Added the enchanted item trades to clerics (e.g. 1 iron pickaxe + 3 emeralds → 1 iron pickaxe with Fortune I).
** Includes iron sword, iron pickaxe, iron axe, iron chestplate, diamond sword, diamond pickaxe, diamond axe, and diamond chestplate.
* Added the 1 emerald → 5 [[arrow]]s trade.
* Switched the 2 [[eyes of ender]] → 1 emerald to 7-10 emeralds → 1 eye of ender.
* Removed the 36- 63 [[rotten flesh]] → 1 emerald trade.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Pressing {{key|F}} reloads the chunks.

== Fixes ==

* Fixed the size of slimes which was sometimes wrong in the previous snapshot.
* Fully charged arrows now show their particle effect again.
* Arrows are now stuck at the correct position in the block they hit.

* Fixed [[enderman]] often not shaking and opening their jaws when looked at.<ref>{{tweet|evilseph|207996349088673792|Made Enderman scarier (or maybe just as scary as some people are used to...)}}</ref>
* Fixed repeaters sometimes being stuck when loading the chunks they are in.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|207933814641659905|Hey redstoners (... what?), let's all go give 
@shadowjay1 a big hug for helping to fix the bug where diodes get stuck on load.|archive=yes}}</ref>
