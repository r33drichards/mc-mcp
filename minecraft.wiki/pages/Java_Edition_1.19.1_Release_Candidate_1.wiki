'''1.19.1 Release Candidate 1''' (known as '''1.19.1-rc1''' in the launcher) is the first release candidate for [[Java Edition 1.19.1]], released on June 23, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-19-1-release-candidate-1|Minecraft 1.19.1 Release Candidate 1|June 23, 2022}}</ref> which updates the categories for chat reporting and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* The {{cd|run_command}} click event for text components no longer supports sending chat messages directly.
** Only commands are supported, so a command such as {{cmd|say}} should be used instead.
** This means values now always need to be {{cd|/}}-prefixed.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* The "Blending" row now disappears when chuck that the player is in uses the new method, instead of displaying "Blending: New".

'''[[Social interactions screen]]'''
* Updated the categories for chat reporting.
** Removed the "Extreme violence or gore", "Nudity or pornography", and "Profanity" categories.
** Updated descriptions of the following categories:
*** Defamation, impersonation, or false information
**** Someone is damaging someone else's reputation, pretending to be someone they're not, or sharing false information<ins class="tc-yes"> with the aim to exploit or mislead others</ins>.
*** Drugs or alcohol
**** Someone is <del class="tc-no">talking about or otherwise promoting drugs or alcohol</del> <ins class="tc-yes">encouraging others to partake in illegal drug related activities or encouraging underage drinking</ins>.
*** Harassment or bullying
**** Someone is shaming, attacking, or bullying you or someone else. This includes when someone is repeatedly trying to contact you or someone else without consent <ins class="tc-yes"> or posting private personal information about you or someone else without consent</ins>.
*** Terrorism or violent extremism
**** Someone is talking about, promoting, or threatening <del class="tc-no">with</del> <ins class="tc-yes">to commit</ins> acts of terrorism or violent extremism for political, religious, ideological, or other reasons.
* Decreased the maximum number of selected messages from 10 to 4, and changed the amount of chat context sent with each chat report from 4 older messages and 2 newer messages to 7 older messages and 2 newer messages.
