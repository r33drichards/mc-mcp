{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Bedrock Edition'' installation files}}
The '''installation files''' for {{BE}} contain the game program as well as resources required to run the game, such as [[resource pack|resource packs]], [[behavior pack|behavior packs]], [[skin pack|skin packs]] and [[Vibrant Visuals]] configurations. On the Windows version of {{BE}}, those are located in {{file|directory|'''Minecraft for Windows'''|inline=1}} or {{file|directory|'''Minecraft Preview for Windows'''|inline=1}}.

== Location ==
=== Windows ===
On Windows, the files are located under the {{cd|''&lt;installation drive&gt;''\XboxGames\Minecraft for Windows}} (or {{cd|..\Minecraft Preview for Windows}} for ''[[Minecraft Preview|Preview]]'') directory. This directory contains a few unknown files and a {{file|directory|Content|inline=1}} directory containing all data. The {{cd|XboxGames}} directory may also be located on other {{w|Disk partitioning|partition}} depending on the game's installation folder, which is configured in Microsoft Store or the Xbox app.<ref>https://www.elevenforum.com/t/change-game-installation-options-in-microsoft-store-and-xbox-app-in-windows-11.19791/</ref>

The main {{file|directory|Content|inline=1}} directory can also be accessed from the old UWP storage location in {{cd|%PROGRAMFILES%\WindowsApps}}. The directory's name is different based on each versions:
* For release versions, it is formatted like {{cd|MICROSOFT.MINECRAFTUWP_''<internal version>''_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe}}.
* For ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', it is formatted like {{cd|Microsoft.MinecraftWindowsBeta_''<internal version>''_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe}}.
* For ''[[Minecraft Education]]'', it is formatted like {{cd|Microsoft.MinecraftEducationEdition_''<internal version>''_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe}}

=== Android ===

On Android, the files are located inside {{w|APK}} files. Those are based on ZIP archives, and can be opened with an archive tool that supports this format. The assets present in the {{File|directory|Content|inline=1}} directory on Windows are located in the <code>install_pack.apk</code> split, inside the {{File|directory|assets|inline=1}} directory.

When the game is installed, the APK files are installed into <code>/data/app</code>. While this directory is not readable without root, it is possible to access the APK files using {{w|Android Debug Bridge}} (ADB) or third-party tools like [https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.smartpack.packagemanager/ Package Manager].
