A '''diamond spear''' is a variant of [[spear]] crafted from [[diamond]]s. It can be used to perform slow jab attacks or held forward to deal increasing [[damage]] based on how quickly the wielder is moving. It is the second-highest [[tier]] of spear, dealing more damage and having higher durability than an [[iron spear]], at the cost of lower attack speed. It can be upgraded into a [[netherite spear]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

== Usage ==
=== Attacking ===
==== Jab attack ====
A  diamond spear can be {{control|attack|text=used}} while standing on the ground to perform a jab attack, dealing damage, and afterwards entering a recharge cooldown similar to that of an ender pearl or chorus fruit on Bedrock Edition, or a version of the normal attack cooldown on Java Edition.

==== Charge attack ====
When holding down the {{control|attack|text=use}} key, the spear is lowered into an attack position, where colliding with a target deals damage depending on the velocity of the user, and the attack dismounts attacked targets from their mounts. After being held out for too long, the charge attack goes into a shaking state where attacks no longer dismount targets from their mounts. After even longer, the charge attack goes into a dropped down state where attacks no longer deal [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]], but still deal full damage.
