'''''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''''' (Japanese: '''''大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ SPECIAL''''') is a crossover action fighting game published by {{w|Nintendo}}. It was released on December 7, 2018 on {{w|Nintendo Switch|Nintendo Switch systems}}.

''Minecraft'' content was added to the game as paid downloadable content on October 13, 2020.

== Background ==
''{{Wikipedia|Super Smash Bros.}}'' is a series of platform fighting video games, spearheaded by {{Wikipedia|Masahiro Sakurai}}. The series is known for being a large crossover between various video game franchises, primarily those created by Nintendo, such as {{Wikipedia|Mario}}, {{Wikipedia|The Legend of Zelda}}, {{Wikipedia|Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon}}, {{Wikipedia|Metroid}}, {{Wikipedia|Star Fox}}, and {{Wikipedia|Kirby (series)|Kirby}}, where characters from each series can duel it out. Beginning in the third installment, {{Wikipedia|Super Smash Bros. Brawl}}, third party characters were introduced, beginning with {{Wikipedia|Solid Snake}} and [[Sonic the Hedgehog]].

== ''Minecraft'' content ==
=== Steve & Alex ===
[[Player|'''Steve''' and '''Alex''']] were announced as a new playable fighter in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' on October 1, 2020 as part of Challenger Pack 7. A [[zombie]] and an [[enderman]] were also revealed as alternate costumes for the fighter. The DLC pack was released on October 13, 2020 for US$5.99.

==== Moveset ====
* Neutral Special ({{nsbtn|b}}): [[Breaking|Mine]] / [[Crafting|Craft]] / Create Block - When on the ground, the player will mine the surface below or an adjacent wall. This provides materials which are used in many other attacks. The type of materials collected is random, but influenced by the type of surface. When standing next to the [[crafting table]], tools of the highest-quality material the player has will be crafted. In the air, blocks will be placed below the player. The button can be held to continue placing as the player moves. Placed blocks break after a short time, and can also be broken by attacks.
* Side Special ({{nsbtn|b}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-horizontal}}): [[Minecart]] - The player rides a minecart, laying [[rails]] as they go. [[Powered rails]] and [[redstone torch|redstone torches]] can be placed for a speed boost if the player has [[gold]] and [[redstone]]. The minecart can be dismounted by jumping ({{nsbtn|x}}/{{nsbtn|y}}/{{xbtn|thumb-left-up}}). After dismounting, the minecart can pick up opponents and carry them away.
* Up Special ({{nsbtn|b}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-up}}): [[Elytra]] - The player equips an elytra and ascends using a [[firework rocket]]. The gliding trajectory can be adjusted by tilting {{xbtn|thumb-left-vertical}}. 
* Down Special ({{nsbtn|b}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-down}}): [[TNT]] - Places a block of TNT, consuming a lot of materials. Holding {{nsbtn|b}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-horizontal}} places [[Redstone Dust|redstone]] and, when letting go, a [[Pressure Plate|plate]] that can set off the block.
* Final Smash ({{nsbtn|b}} after being eligible for a Final Smash)<ref>After breaking a Smash Ball, getting a full Final Smash meter, or being granted a Final Smash through other means.</ref>: ''House of Boom'' - Creates a big [[piston]] that strikes out in the direction the player is facing. A player in its path will be launched into a dark room full of TNT, where creepers set off a chain-reaction explosion. Multiple players can be hit by the piston, but only one will be launched into the room.

=== Stages ===
{{Redirect|Minecraft World|the in-game space where [[entities]] can exist|World}}
'''Minecraft World''' is a stage in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. True to the source material, it can take the appearance of various [[biomes]], affecting the stage layout. The stage also has a [[day-night cycle]]. The background of this stage is seemingly based on {{JE}}, due to terrain differences such as the abundance of tall grass in the Plains stage and snow layers not occupying the same block as plants in the Snowy Tundra stage.

Each biome can be forced to load by entering inputs in the stage select screen. The biomes are, as follows:
* [[Plains]] - the default biome. Features a [[village]] in the background, with a [[bell]] and animal pen. The layout includes a broken-down house and a pile of [[Hay Bale|hay bales]]. This biome is also used in the Battlefield and Ω forms of the stage. Can be loaded by holding {{nsbtn|l}}.
* [[Birch Forest]] - features two platforms hidden in two [[birch]] trees. Can be loaded by holding {{nsbtn|l}} + {{nsbtn|r}}.
* [[Savanna]] - has a double-canopy [[acacia]] tree, which hides a platform. Can be loaded by holding {{nsbtn|l}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-up}}.
* [[Taiga]] - features a single taiga village house in the background. The stage layout contains a [[forest rock]] and a [[spruce]] tree. Can be loaded by holding {{nsbtn|l}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-right}}.
* [[Snowy Tundra]] - features a snowy tundra village house in the background, along with a [[sheep]] pen and a lamp post. The stage layout has two platforms and an [[igloo]] in the middle. Can be loaded by holding {{nsbtn|l}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-down}}.
* [[Stone Shore]] - features a single platform and a [[cave]]-like [[stone]] formation, with an [[ocean]] separating the main stage from the [[mountains]]. Can be loaded by holding {{nsbtn|l}} + {{xbtn|thumb-left-left}}.

|Like the original songs, the arrangement is led by a piano, but the tempo is much faster paced. The song also incorporates electric guitar riffs, a modern drum kit, and string sections. The arrangement is synched to the day-night cycle of the Minecraft World stage, assuming the match isn't paused. The piano and guitar were performed by Takayuki Yoshimura and Yuya Komoguchi respectively, with Tomotaka Saka serving as the recording and mixing engineer.<ref>[https://twitter.com/Tomori_Kudo/status/1316290491009257472 @Tomori_Kudo on Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/Tomori_Kudo/status/1317327702467047424 @Tomori_Kudo on Twitter]</ref>

=== Mii Fighter costumes ===
* [[Creeper]] (Brawler) - a model replacement costume for the Mii Brawler. The Mii's limbs are replaced by floating creeper legs.
* [[Pig]] (Brawler) - another model replacement costume for the Mii Brawler in a similar vein to the Creeper (Brawler). The costume may be based on the famous [[Pig#History|pig model error.]]

== Trivia ==
* Steve is referred within the game files with the codename "pickel". In Japanese, the loanword ''pikkeru'' is used to refer to ice axes, deriving from the German word "Eispickel".
* According to former ''Minecraft'' production director [[Daniel Kaplan]], it took at least 5 years of negotiating between Nintendo and [[Mojang Studios]] for Steve to appear in ''Smash''.<ref>{{tweet|Kappische|1311773807175180296|3 is not enough. At least five|October 1, 2020}}</ref>
* The initial reveal of Steve on October 1, 2020 led to a large influx of activity on Twitter, resulting in the website becoming unreachable for a short period of time. The last time that Twitter experienced an outage was on June 25, 2009, with the death of popular singer Michael Jackson causing a similar influx of activity.<ref>https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2020/oct/06/smash-steve-broke-twitter/</ref>
* Steve's alternate costumes each consist of a [https://www.ssbwiki.com/File:SteveTextures.png single texture taken from ''Minecraft''] and modified slightly presumably to account for the different lighting in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. This notably makes modifying them through file replacement extremely simple.
*Due to being released when version [[Nether Update|1.16]] was the latest release, any graphical changes made in later updates are not reflected in ''Ultimate''.
* While most of the ''Minecraft'' textures in Steve's moveset and in the Minecraft World stage use the [[Texture Update]] versions of their textures, some items (like dropped elytra, dropped minecarts, dropped [[oak log]]s, dropped [[cobblestone]], dropped [[iron ingots]], dropped [[gold ingot]]s, and dropped [[diamond]]s) use the Programmer Art textures.
** The Zombie costume also uses the Programmer Art Zombie texture.
** Interestingly, despite dropped oak logs using Programmer Art, the placed oak logs in the Minecraft World stages do correctly use the Texture Update textures.
* [[File:Chiwi Makena.jpg|thumb|194x194px|Makena in the taiga.]]In Steve's official announcement trailer, when introducing the Alex costume, the village house Alex emerges from has many texture issues, with some logs facing in incorrect directions, a window using the top half of the [[oak door]] instead of [[Glass Pane|glass panes]], and a section of a wall being comprised of [[Log|dark oak logs]], which seem to be the only placed textures to use Minecraft's Programmer Art. Additionally, in the Zombie costume introduction, the door the Zombie breaks has a misaligned top and bottom texture.
* The name of Steve's Classic Mode route, "Journey to the Far Lands," is a reference to a bug regarding world generation where traversing 12.5 million blocks away from the center of the world glitches the terrain, which the community nicknamed the [[Far Lands]].
* The alternate versions of Steve and Alex originate from the [[Default Skin Pack (Legacy Console Edition)|default skin pack]] included in the [[Legacy Console Edition]]s.
* Although introduced after the release of the collaboration, [[Chiwi]] posted an image of [[Makena]], seemingly being played in the game.
* An image released for the [[Ice Cube Claims Adjuster]] series reuses this game’s render of Steve, depicted looking down at [[Ice Cube]].
