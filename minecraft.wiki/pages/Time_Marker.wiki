A '''time marker''' is a feature that assigns a particular name to a specific (optionally repeating) point in time for a specific world clock. Time markers replace the previously predetermined names that could be used by {{cmd|time set}}, for example {{cd|day}} or {{cd|night}}.

Time markers will exist within the context of a specific world clock. This means that even though the different time markers are defined by different Timelines, only one Time Marker can exist with a particular id for a particular world clock. It also means that two world clocks can have a Time Marker with the same name.
* Built-in uses of time markers
** Some time markers are used to drive Vanilla game behavior. Usually, they are configured to not show up in {{cmd|time}} commands.
*** {{cd|minecraft:wake_up_from_sleep}} - the time to advance the dimension's default clock to when players in that dimension wake up after sleeping.
*** {{cd|minecraft:roll_village_siege}} - the time of the dimension's default clock at which the random chance for a Zombie Village siege to occur should be evaluated.
