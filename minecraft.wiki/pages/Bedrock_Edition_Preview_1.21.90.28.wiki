== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Happy Ghast]]'''
* Players riding happy ghasts no longer cause nearby happy ghasts to stop.
** This prevents players from blocking each other when flying happy ghasts too close together.
* Happy ghasts can now be pushed by other mobs even while being ridden, except when made immobile by a player standing on it.

=== Graphical ===
'''[[Vibrant Visuals]]'''
* Turned off Vibrant Visuals by default on some console devices (Xbox One, Xbox One S, PlayStation 4).

=== Technical ===
'''Entity Filters'''
* Added the {{cd|is_vehicle_family}} entity filter, which returns true when the subject entity is riding a vehicle with the specified family.
