{{for|the combat test with the same name as this version|Java Edition 1.14.3 - Combat Test}}

'''1.14.3''' is a minor update to {{JE}} released on June 24, 2019,<ref name="1.14.3">{{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-14-3|Minecraft Java Edition 1.14.3|June 24, 2019}}</ref> which makes small changes to [[villager]]s, adds a [[game rule]] to disable raids, changes some block placement rules, and fixes many bugs left over from [[Java Edition 1.14.2|1.14.2]]. It is not compatible with 1.14.2 servers.

== Additions ==
=== Commands ===
'''{{cmd|gamerule}}'''
* Added {{cmd|gamerule disableRaids}} which disables [[raid]]s when set to <code>true</code>.
** When true, the [[Bad Omen]] is not removed from a player when entering a village.
** If set to true while a raid is in progress, the raid stops, but the existing raid mobs don't despawn.

=== Options ===
'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Bashkir (Башҡортса) language.
* Added Gothic (Gutrazda) language.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Lantern]]s'''
* Can now be placed on [[iron bars]] and [[glass pane]]s.
* Can now be attached below iron bars and glass panes.

'''[[Pressure plate]]s and [[torch]]es'''
* Can now be placed on iron bars and glass panes.

=== Items ===
'''General'''
* Items can once again be repaired by crafting them together, as they could before [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Panicked villagers now have to work and sleep so they cannot be in a state of panic all the time.
* The "last slept" and "last worked" properties for villagers are now saved properly.
* Panicking villagers now have a higher chance of spawning [[iron golem]]s.
* Farmers now spend more time farming when they are working.
* Farmers now always give away food even if other villagers do not need it.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Illager patrol]]s'''
* [[Vindicator]]s are no longer part of patrols.
* Doubled the minimum time to spawn from 5 minutes to 10–11 minutes.
* Patrols no longer spawn if the block light level disallows monster spawning.
* Patrols are now allowed to spawn in any biome except mushroom biomes.

'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* [[Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], and [[Blast Protection]] are now mutually exclusive again, as they were prior to 1.14.

'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]] is no longer required for the "How Did We Get Here?" advancement.

=== General ===
'''Performance'''
* Improved performance.
