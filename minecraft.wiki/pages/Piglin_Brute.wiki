A '''piglin brute''' is a [[hostile]], stronger variant of the [[piglin]]. It wields a golden axe and appears in all types of [[bastion remnant]]s. Unlike piglins, piglin brutes do not barter, retreat, or get distracted by [[gold]].

== Spawning ==
A small number of piglin brutes spawn in some rooms of [[bastion remnants]] ''only upon generation'', so they are not renewable. They do not have a baby variant.

Piglin brutes spawn with a golden axe, occasionally with enchantments{{only|je}}. They never spawn with [[armor]] and do not equip armor from the ground, although they can still be equipped with armor via dispensers or commands.

== Drops ==
A piglin brute has 8.5% chance of dropping a {{ItemLink|golden axe}} with a random [[durability]] if killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]], increased by 1% with each level of [[Looting]], with a total 11.5% chance with Looting III.

A piglin brute drops {{xp|20}} [[experience]] points when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
[[File:Piglin Brute Attack Mode.png|thumb|right|upright|A piglin brute attacking.]]  
Piglin brutes attack [[player]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, and [[wither]]s within 16 blocks and are not distracted by golden [[item]]s or [[block]]s. However, they prefer to attack players over wither skeletons and withers. They also attack any mob, including [[goat]]s,<ref>{{bug|MC-227625}}</ref> that attacks any piglin or piglin brute, either by accident or purposefully. Examples include retaliation for attacks by [[snow golems]] and [[iron golems]]. 

Piglin brutes, much like [[vindicator]]s, deal a high amount of raw melee damage, inflicting {{hp|19.5}} points of damage on Hard difficulty. The only stronger mobs are the [[iron golem]], which deals up to {{hp|32.25}} melee damage, the [[warden]], which deals up to {{hp|45}} melee damage and the unused [[giant]], which deals up to {{hp|75}} melee damage.

Piglin brutes spawn in all [[difficulty]] settings. In [[Peaceful]] difficulty, piglin brutes despawn.

The detection range of piglin brutes is reduced to half of their normal range (8 blocks) when the player is wearing a piglin [[head]].

Behaviors shared by both [[piglin]]s and piglin brutes:

*Can open [[Wooden Door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s.
*Call nearby piglins and other piglin brutes once attacked by a mob or a player, no matter whether the player wears golden armor or not.
*Are not naturally immune to [[fire]] or [[lava]].<ref>{{bug|MC-172102|||WAI}}</ref>
*Join in hunts.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
*Turns into a [[zombified piglin]] when in the Overworld or the End for more than 15 seconds.
*Attack nearby withers and wither skeletons.
*They cannot swim, sink in [[water]] and eventually drown.

Behaviors specific to piglin brutes:

*Piglin brutes attack players on sight, no matter whether the player wears golden armor or not.
*Piglin brutes do not retreat from soul [[fire]] [[item]]s, [[zoglin]]s, or [[zombified piglin]]s.
*Piglin brutes do not perform a "victory dance".
*Piglin brutes do not barter, as the player cannot use a gold ingot on them.
*Piglin brutes pick up regular or [[enchanted]] golden axes only if walking over them. Unlike [[piglins]], piglin brutes ignore all other golden items or gold ingots, meaning they cannot equip armor. However, they can still be equipped via [[dispenser]]s or [[commands]].
*They do not have a baby variant. This also means they cannot ride hoglins.
*They cannot use crossbows.
*They attempt to return to their spawn point (regardless of how they were spawned) when not engaged in combat.
*They do not join hunts and do not attack hoglins.{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-193065|||WAI}}</ref>
*They do not drop [[piglin head]]s when killed by a [[charged creeper]]'s explosion.

=== Zombification ===
[[File:Piglin Brute being zombified.gif|thumb|right|upright|A piglin brute turning into a zombified piglin.]]
When in the [[Overworld]] or [[the End]], piglin brutes transform into [[zombified piglin]]s after 15 seconds. Upon transformation, the spawned zombified piglin has the [[Nausea]] effect for 10 seconds{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>This does not happen in Bedrock Edition due to {{bug|MCPE-70866}}.</ref>. This Nausea effect is purely cosmetic. When turned into a zombified piglin, a piglin brute keeps its axe.

Piglin brutes summoned in the Overworld with no AI do not zombify and do not pick up items.

== Trivia ==
* Piglin brutes were hinted to not have good eyesight.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1276244259109298177|Icing on the nether cake: We added Piglin Brutes! Wanted to increase the challenge of bastions a bit. They are a lot tougher than normal piglins, stay near one spot, and can't be distracted! Hint: they don't see very well :)|Jun 26, 2020}}</ref>
* Piglin brutes were created late in [[1.16]]'s development, so they were pushed to a minor release as the developers did not want to add a new feature so close to release.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1276298539828682753|Pretty much, yes.|June 25, 2020}}</ref>
* The golden arm guard is meant to work as a "protection" and is the reason behind their high health.<ref>{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1276235448197812224|Their golden arm guard functions as a mini shield, now it won't block in animation, but that's the idea behind it🙏Hence why they have more health than normal piglins, they don't wear armor at all, they feel like it wears them down. These piggies are strong on their own|June 25, 2020}}</ref>
* Sounds that are used by the piglins are lower-pitched when used by the piglin brute (like the <code>converted_to_zombified</code> sound).
* Piglin brutes were made to trigger normal piglins when attacked, as to encourage players to avoid or maneuver around them.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1276427018939314176|It's 100% not useless! You don't want to come to a Bastion without gold armor, even if the Brutes will attack you without it they are less common in the Bastions than normal Piglins. The idea is to try to avoid or maneuver around the Brutes.|June 26, 2020}}</ref>
