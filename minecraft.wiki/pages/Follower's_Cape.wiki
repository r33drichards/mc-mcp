The '''Follower's Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out as part of the [[15 Days of Minecraft|15 Days of ''Minecraft'']] celebrations, alongside the [[Purple Heart cape]] and the [[15th Anniversary cape]].

== Appearance ==
The cape accompanies a white [[creeper]] face on a dark background which emulates a design similar to the [[TikTok]] logo, an electronic wave effect. On either side of the cape are two blue and red strips, acting as the border.

== Distribution ==
Players could receive this cape by [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem redeeming a code], which can be obtained by watching any ''Minecraft'' livestream on [[TikTok]]. This event started on May 15, 2024 and ended on May 31, 2024.

Depending on the user's region, there were additional requirements, such as watching for an ''X'' amount of minutes, or having to type "minecraft" in the chat.

This task could not be completed normally in regions where either TikTok or its rewards program were banned. Players in these regions could obtain the cape by circumventing the ban somehow (such as with a VPN), traveling to regions where they were not banned, or receiving a code from another player.
