== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:MinecraftBoss.ogg]]

"Boss" is largely based on modified versions of some themes from Minecraft - Alpha Volume. The theme is a very dark ambient piece with an ominous air of desolation and hopelessness.

Throughout the track, you can hear extremely distorted or remixed versions of parts of the tracks "[[Music Disc cat|Cat]]", "[[Haggstrom]]" and "[[Subwoofer Lullaby]]" from Minecraft - Volume Alpha, while ambient background noises gradually increase in intensity.
