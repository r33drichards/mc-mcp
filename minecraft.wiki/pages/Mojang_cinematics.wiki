==== Summary ====
[[Steve]] and [[Alex]] are exploring a [[mountain]] [[cave]], with Steve feeling intimidated by a [[cobweb]]. After cowering behind Alex, she pulls out a [[torch]], and soon they begin mining for [[copper]]. Feeling mischievous, Alex makes a shadow puppet of a [[spider]] using a [[dead bush]], to Steve's horror. After some facial banter, Alex decides to leave on a [[minecart]], but falls down a long track through a [[mineshaft]] into a [[lush cave]]. A [[spring]] catches her fall, meanwhile Steve continues mining and ends up falling into a [[dripstone cave]] himself, suffering great injuries through slapstick.

Meanwhile, Alex dances on [[big dripleaves]]. She then stumbles upon an [[amethyst geode]]. Steve is not so fortunate, getting burned and stabbed many times while trying to find his way out, as several real spiders apparently sit back and laugh at him. Alex befriends an [[axolotl]], Steve tries to run in fear from a massive clutter of spiders. He falls down a hole and falls right on top of Alex, sending her down a waterfall into a cave full of monsters. In a panic, they use the materials they gathered over their journey to craft a [[spyglass]], eyeing out an exit for them. With the axolotl [[bucket of aquatic mob|bucketed]], they scurry out of the cave and seal it with [[gravel]], only to realize they are now at the top of the mountain.

To make matters worse, Steve is rammed off the cliff by a [[goat]].

==== Summary ====
[[Noor]] is eating a [[glow berry]] while relaxing on a [[boat chest]] in a [[mangrove swamp]], when suddenly an army of [[tadpoles]] appear. Taking a liking to one tadpole, Noor decides to put it in a [[bucket]], before reaching into the [[chest]] and pulling out a [[spyglass]]. With it, Noor spies an [[allay]] playing near a [[Nether portal]], which [[Alex]], [[Steve]], and a [[frog]] then emerge out of. Noor takes another liking to the allay, and decides to hand it a glow berry. The allay decides to lead Noor somewhere, passing by Steve and Alex digging a hole, before arriving at a beautiful [[lush cave]] where many frogs are playing on [[big dripleaves]]. Amazed by its beauty, Noor decides to depart with the tadpole, releasing it into the spring.

=== The Wild Update: Craft Your Path ===

Explore the swamps together with frogs and tadpoles. Ask an allay to collect supplies to fill the chest on your boat. Build with sculk, mud, and mangrove wood. The choices are endless, and all of them yours. The Wild Update (Minecraft 1.19) is available on June 7 to download on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, and Windows – and Minecraft: Java Edition on Windows, macOS, and Linux. On Windows, you can even play both editions, because Java & Bedrock for PC is now available!}}

==== Summary ====
[[Steve]] and [[Alex]] are mining [[sculk]] near an [[ancient city]], accidentally setting off a [[sculk shrieker]] to Steve's horror. Later, Alex and Steve are fighting a horde of [[piglins]], as an accompanying [[frog]] barfs out a [[froglight]]. After escaping through a [[Nether portal]], the duo begin digging a hole; the same one seen in ''Where Will You Wander''. The scene transitions into a campsite, where Steve, Alex, [[Sunny]], [[Noor]], and [[Efe]] are relaying stories around a [[campfire]]. An [[allay]] arrives and drops a [[glow berry]] below Noor's feet. Inspired, Noor pulls out a second glow berry and recounts the events of ''Where Will You Wander'', eating the berry after finishing.

Sunny and Efe begin reciting a story themselves, Sunny mimicking the [[Warden]] to set the mood. The trailer then fades into footage of ''What Will You Uncover'', before Sunny pulls out an egg, presumably the one that ratted them out. Sunny then tosses it away, to the [[chicken]]'s dismay. Irritated, the chicken then startles Efe and Sunny.

==== Summary ====
Animated to the tune of Orchestral Suite no. 2 in B minor, a baby piglin takes the stage. Appearing first under a spotlight, seemingly nervous, many other piglins appear, first with their eyes glowing in the dark, then dancing in the light with gold swords. The baby piglin is quickly approached by four hoglins, inexplicably dancing on their hind legs, alongside a baby hoglin that is pushed off a cliff with the piglin. The two fall on top of a [[piglin brute]], who is intimidated and irritated by their disturbance on their cranium. Seemingly threatening them with an axe, the two dance away in a hurry, leaping across many [[strider]]s to safety in a basalt delta, and then being launched into the air by magma cubes.

At the top of the delta, the piglin begins riding the hoglin, passing by a random sheep. A barrage of ghasts begin shooting fireballs at them, but they manage to avoid all but the last one, which sends them flying into a minecart. A haunting of endermen are loitering on the track, teleporting away in a panic right before being hit. As the duo reaches the end of the track, many mobs join them in their dance, culminating in them all climbing on top of each other and striking a pose.

While a goat tries desperately to harmonise with you? Ooops, that was one of the features! Consider it a freebie, but now it's your turn to sing the rest alongside Element Animation’s bleat-tastic musical. Aaaaaaaaaargh!}}

==== Summary ====
Steve and Alex are meeting up in a village, when they're suddenly approached by a non-corporeal voice, asking if they've discovered everything in part one of the [[Caves & Cliffs]] update. They shrug, triggering an earthquake. They fall into a display of many new features, including [[candles]]s, [[glow lichen]]s, and [[amethyst geode]]s. While Alex is mining amethyst, she's interrupted by a screaming goat. The song continues, stressing those are only a fraction of the new features, listing off [[dripleaves]], more options for [[dirt path]]s, powder snow, [[copper ore]], [[raw ore]], and [[lightning rod]]s. After announcing that last feature, a wandering trader is electrocuted.

The song moves on to explain [[oxidation]] and the use of honeycombs to wax them. The song then establishes blocks of raw copper, but Steve notices a goat and expects it to scream. It doesn't, but a second goat next to him does. The song then introduces axolotls, and them being compatible with buckets, before moving onto glow squids and their ambience, as well as their [[Glow Ink Sac|ink]] being usable on signs and item frames. The song then mentions [[dripstone caves]] and [[deepslate ore]]s. As Steve and Alex climb up a mountain, the song concludes by stressing more content is being added, before a goat screams again.
