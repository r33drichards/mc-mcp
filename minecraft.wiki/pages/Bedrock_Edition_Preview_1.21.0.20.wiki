=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Ominous Trial Spawner]]'''
*A more powerful active phase of the [[Trial Spawner]] with unique challenges and rewards.
**Provides a more challenging experience that players can opt into for better rewards.
*If a Trial Spawner detects a player that has the [[Trial Omen]] effect, the spawner will become Ominous if:
**It is not in cooldown.
**It is in cooldown but was not Ominous during its last activation.
***Making it Ominous this way will bypass the cooldown.
**While active, it will:
***Glow blue instead of orange.
***Emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
***More commonly spawn mobs with equipment if they can wear it.
****The equipment these mobs wear have Armor Trims applied from the Trial Chambers.

***When defeated, it will eject a different set of loot than normal Trial Spawners.

'''[[Ominous Vault]]'''
*A variant of [[Vault]]s that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
*These can be found throughout the [[Trial Chambers]] in harder to find places and require an Ominous Trial Key to unlock.

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Ominous Events]]'''
*Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in Trial Chambers.
*These optional experiences accessed through Bad Omen are now known as Ominous Events.
**They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways.

*Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
**It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player.

***Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new Ominous Bottle.

**[[Oozing]]
***Affected entities will spawn two [[Slime]]s upon death.
**[[Infested]]
***Affected entities have a 5% chance to spawn 1-2 [[Silverfish]] when hurt.
*These effects can be encountered while taking on an Ominous Trial Spawner.
**Spawners in an area will select a unique effect for the duration of their challenge, and drop them as lingering potions onto mobs and players nearby.
* [[Trial Omen]]
** A variant that Bad Omen can transform into if the player is within detection range of a [[Trial Spawner]] that is not Ominous.
** The Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level.
** Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles.
*Some mobs are immune to these effects.
**Slimes are immune to Oozing.
**Silverfish are immune to Infested.

*Trial Spawner in Ominous state spawns mobs with equipment they can wear.
**That equipment will have Armor Trims from the Trial Chambers.

'''[[Heavy Core]]'''
