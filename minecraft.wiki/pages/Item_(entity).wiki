'''Items''' are "dropped" [[block]]s or [[item]]s (non-block resources) that appear in the world, rather than being in the [[inventory]] of a [[player]] or [[block entity]]; they are a type of [[entity]].

== Appearance ==
[[File:Item entities.png|150px|thumb|3D dropped items, both blocks and strict items.]]

Items have two possible appearances, generally corresponding to whether the item appears as a 3D or 2D shape in a player's inventory screens. 3D items appear as their 3D shape, miniaturized to about {{frac|1|4}} scale, while 2D items appear as {{frac|1|2}} scale with all the pixels extruded into a cube. Both types slowly rotate and bob up and down; this is merely a visual effect, the item itself does not actually rotate or bob up and down.

Item entities that represent a stack of more than one item appear as several items stuck together. Stacks of 1 appear as one item, 2-16 as two items, 17–32 as three, 33-48 as four, and 49+ as five.

The rotation rate of the item is approximately 2.9 degrees per tick, or 57.6 degrees per second.

== Behavior ==
Item entities come from many sources. Some common ones are:
* The death of a [[mob]] or [[player]].
* A [[block]] that is mined by a player, destroyed by an [[explosion]], or washed away by [[water]].
* An inventory item tossed by pressing the drop item key (default {{key|Q}} on PC, {{xbtn|dpad-down}} on Xbox, {{nsbtn|down}}/{{nsbtn|dpad-down}} on Nintendo Switch, {{psbtn|dpad-down}} on PlayStation) or dragging a stack outside of an inventory window.
** In the mobile versions of {{BE}}, items in the hotbar can be dropped by pressing on the item's slot. The entire stack is dropped.
* A container (other than an {{BlockLink|ender chest}} or a {{BlockLink|shulker box}}) that is destroyed while holding items inside.

The player may be thought of as having an "item pickup" box that surrounds their hitbox. This pickup box extends 1 additional block to the horizontal sides, and 0.5 additional blocks up and down. Any item whose hitbox intersects with the pickup box can be picked up. The pickup box is inclusive on the horizontal sides (for distance less than or equal to 1), and exclusive on the vertical sides (distance less than 0.5). When the player's hitbox size changes, such as when crouching or sleeping, the pickup box size changes with it.

Once an item entity's hitbox overlaps with the player's pickup box, it can transfer its items. As many items as can fit in the player inventory, excluding the armor slots and the [[dual wield|off-hand slot]], are transferred. If any item is transferred, [[Item (entity)#Sounds|a "plopping" sound]] is played. If all items are transferred, the items appear to move into the center of the player. The item entity never physically moves, however, which means it can appear to go through lava and blocks in its path. This can happen through blocks that are thinner than a full block, but also through the shared edge of two full blocks. Unlike [[experience orb]]s, multiple item entities can be picked up simultaneously. Dropped items have a delay of 10 [[tick]]s (half a second) between appearing and being able to be picked up, or 40 ticks (2 seconds) if thrown by a player, [[dolphin]], or [[fox]].

Items do not collide with other entities (except [[boat]]s and [[shulker]]s) and are only moved or stopped by blocks.

Like other entities, items can be pushed by flowing water and [[bubble column]]s, pushed by a [[piston]], launched by a moving [[slime block]], stuck to a [[honey block]], or caught in a [[cobweb]]. Items move at faster speeds if [[ice]] is placed under the flowing water. When in still water, items float slowly up to the surface.

{{IN|java}}, items can be reeled by [[fishing rod]]s, costing 3 [[durability]].

If an item is within a [[solid block]], it then flies out one of the unobstructed sides, or out of the top of the block if surrounded by solid blocks on all sides. It does this even if the space below is unoccupied; therefore, it is possible to recover an item dropped by breaking a hole in a floor by quickly placing another block there.

Items visually disappear when the player is about 16 blocks away from them, and reappear when they get closer. {{IN|java}}, this distance can be adjusted by the "Entity Distance" slider in [[Options#Video Settings|video settings]].

Unlike most entities, items cannot be spectated in [[Spectator]] mode without use of the {{cmd|spectate}} command.

When an item entity drops within the pickup box of two separate players simultaneously on a multiplayer server, the player who joined first automatically gets the item. If the item is tossed by one of said players, the other player is prioritized.{{verify|Behaves in this way on Java. Needs verification on Bedrock.}}

=== Mob pickup ===
{{main|Geared mobs#Picking up gear}}
Some mobs, such as [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s, have a chance to spawn being able to pick up weapons and armor depending on [[difficulty]].

=== Merging ===
Two stackable items of the same type can merge together into a single item entity if the resulting stack size does not exceed that item's maximum stack size and if they are within a <code>0.5 x 0.25 x 0.5</code> square bounding box around the other item.

When this happens the item with the largest stack size gets its item count increased while the other is despawned, if the item count is the same the item that is processed first is the one that will be removed.

Items normally attempt to merge every 40 game [[Tick|ticks]] (2 seconds), however items moving across block boundaries can be processed every 2 ticks (0.1 s).

=== Damage ===
Items cannot be attacked by players or mobs; attempting to do so simply hits through them. However, they take damage and disappear from environmental or block-based damage such as [[explosion]]s, [[fire]], [[lava]], and contact with [[cacti]]. Items have essentially no health, so they are destroyed by the slightest damage, though if set on fire they may remain for a few seconds before disappearing. [[Nether star]]s are immune to explosions, and [[netherite]]-based items and tools are immune to fire and float on top of lava. Also, some blocks that normally damage mobs, such as [[magma block]]s, [[campfire]]s, [[sweet berry bush]]es, [[wither rose]]s and [[powder snow]], do not damage items.

=== Despawning ===
Items despawn after 6000 game [[tick]]s (5 minutes) of being in a loaded, entity-ticking [[chunk]]; this is affected by the player's [[simulation distance]]. If two item stacks merge, the timer is set to the item that has more time remaining. The 5-minute timer is paused when the chunk is unloaded or no longer processing entities. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[nether star]]s do not despawn. {{IN|java}}, nether stars dropped by a dying [[wither]] despawn after 10 minutes, but they despawn after 5 minutes if dropped by any other means.

Items that fall into the [[void]] immediately despawn when they fall below <code>world minumum build height - 64</code> (Y=-128 in the [[Overworld]], Y=-64 in [[the Nether]] and [[the End]]).

== Sounds ==
{{Edition|Java}}:<br>
Item Entities use the Ambient/Environment sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

=== Entity data ===
{{see also|Chunk format}}
Dropped items have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.

{{el|java}}:
{{main|Entity format}}
<section begin="entity data"/><div class="treeview" style="margin-top: 0;">
* {{nbt|compound}} Entity data
** {{nbt inherit/entity}}
** {{nbt|short|Age}}: The number of ticks the item has been "untouched". After 6000 ticks (5 minutes) the item is destroyed. If set to -32768, the Age does not increase, preventing the item from despawning automatically.
** {{nbt|short|Health}}: The health of the item, which starts at 5. Items take damage from fire, lava, cacti and explosions. The item is destroyed when its health reaches 0.
** {{nbt|compound|Item}}: The inventory item, without the Slot tag.
*** {{nbt inherit/itemnoslot|indent=***}}
** {{nbt|int-array|Owner}}: If present, only the player with this [[UUID]] can pick up the item. Used by the [[Commands/give|give command]] (and can be set in a summon command) to prevent the wrong player from picking up the spawned item entity. Is not preserved when removed.
** {{nbt|short|PickupDelay}}: The number of ticks the item cannot be picked up. Decreases by 1 per tick. If set to 32767, the PickupDelay does not decrease, preventing the item from being picked up.
** {{nbt|int-array|Thrower}}: The [[UUID]] of the entity who dropped the item. Is not preserved when removed.
