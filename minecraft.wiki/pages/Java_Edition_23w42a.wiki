'''23w42a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.3]], released on October 18, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w42a|October 18, 2023}}</ref> which adds the "[[Java Edition 1.21|Update 1.21]]" experimental toggle and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Experiments]]'''
* Added the "[[Java Edition 1.21|Update 1.21]]" experimental toggle (<code>update_1_21</code> data pack).

'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added <code>playersNetherPortalDefaultDelay</code> to control time (in [[game tick]]s) that a player needs to stand in a [[nether portal]] before changing dimensions, while in Survival and Adventure mode. Defaults to <code>80</code>.
* Added <code>playersNetherPortalCreativeDelay</code> to control time (in game ticks) that a player needs to stand in a nether portal before changing dimensions, while in Creative mode. Defaults to <code>1</code>.
* Added <code>projectilesCanBreakBlocks</code>, to control whether impact projectiles destroy blocks that are destructible by them (i.e. [[chorus flower]]s and [[decorated pot]]s), and to control whether [[trident]]s destroys [[pointed dripstone]]s. Defaults to <code>true</code>.

'''[[Loading screen]]'''
* Added a new screen for handling corrupted level files.
** It gives the player the option to restore a backup, and a quick link to the bug tracker for reporting a bug about it.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Hide Splash Texts" in accessibility options, which allows the [[splash]] in the main menu to be hidden.

'''<samp>[[options.txt]]</samp>'''
* Added <code>hideSplashTexts</code>, defaults to <code>false</code>.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Added new <code>white_smoke</code> particle type.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Decorated pot]]'''
* Now appears in the "Redstone" tab of the Creative inventory.

=== General ===
'''[[Custom structure]]'''
* Changes to structure type definitions (<code>data/minecraft/worldgen/structure</code>):
** Added optional <code>pool_aliases</code> list to jigsaw structures.
** Aliases represent the possibility to rewire jigsaw pool connections by redirecting pool references on individual structure instances.
** Alias variants are represented in <code>type</code> and is one of:
*** <code>direct</code>: 1:1 mapping from an alias to a new pool.
**** <code>alias</code>: Pool to replace.
**** <code>target</code>: Pool to replace with.
*** <code>random</code>: 1:n mapping where a pool from <code>n</code> is randomly selected for the structure instance.
**** <code>alias</code>: Pool to replace.
**** <code>targets</code>: Randomized list of candidate pools to replace <code>alias</code> with.
*** <code>random_group</code>
**** <code>groups</code>: Each group is a randomized list of above alias types.
**** Only one group is selected per structure instance.
**** This enables modelling selections such as "if pool X is replaced with X1, also replace pool Y with Y1".

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>21</code>.
* Added <code>white_smoke</code> particle definition.
* Renamed field {{nbt|short|Fuse}} to {{nbt|short|fuse}} on [[TNT]] entity.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* In NBT format for entity type <code>tnt</code>:
** Added <code>block_state</code>.
*** This field allows replacement of rendered block model.
** Renamed <code>Fuse</code> to <code>fuse</code>.

'''[[Raw JSON text format]]'''
* Changes to chat component serialization:
** Components of type <code>nbt</code> now have <code>source</code> field with allowed values: {{cd|d=and|entity|block|storage}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>19</code>.
* Added block model, item model and block state definitions for <code>crafter</code>.
* Added GUI container texture and sprites for <code>crafter</code>.

'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added <code>firework_rocket</code> into the <code>impact_projectiles</code> entity tag.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the [[Update 1.21]] experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Crafter JE1.png|32px]] [[File:Crafter Triggered JE1.png|32px]] [[File:Crafter Crafting JE1.png|32px]] [[Crafter]]s'''
* Can be crafted with five [[iron ingot]]s, a [[crafting table]], two [[redstone dust]]s, and a [[dropper]] in the crafting table.
* Can be oriented in any direction when placed.
* A [[pickaxe]] can increase the speed of mining them.
* Have a user interface similar to crafting table.
** Have 3×3 interactable crafting grid.
** Their crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand.
*** A toggled slot cannot hold any items and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks such as [[hopper]]s and [[dropper]]s.
*** A toggled slot can be toggled off by player, whether clicked directly or holding item(s), pressing slot keys associated with an empty or a not empty hotbar slot.
** Unlike the crafting table, the slots display a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next redstone pulse, but cannot be manually taken out by the player.
** The user interface is shared between all players interacting with them, meaning that multiple players can interact with them at the same time, similar to [[chest]]s and hoppers.
** The user interface does not have a [[recipe book]] to provide help, so the player must know the recipes.
* The crafter ejects one crafted item at a time when powered by a new redstone pulse, a redstone signal that is not a continuous signal.
** Upon receiving this new signal, crafters eject the recipe result from the front face.
** All the result items are ejected together when the output result has multiple type of items.
* They can interact with hoppers and droppers, to input/output automatically.
** Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull items out of them.
** Droppers can be used to insert items into them.
** Moving items in from another block with a hopper or a dropper prioritizes filling items into slots, by following these rules:
*** If there is a toggled slot, skipped.
*** If there is not a toggled slot, crafters prioritize the first empty slot from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
*** If there is not a toggled slot, and there are no empty slots, crafters prioritize the smallest stack of the same item. If there are multiple possible stacks, pick the first from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
** If failed to select a slot, hoppers and droppers don't take any action.
* When read by a [[redstone comparator]], the redstone signal strength is 0 to 9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength.

=== Changes ===
==== General ====
'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added <code>crafter</code> into <code>mineable/pickaxe</code> and <code>needs_stone_tool</code> block tags.
