'''Fire''' is a [[Opacity#Types of transparent blocks|non-solid block]] that can spread to nearby flammable blocks and destroy them.

== Obtaining ==
Fire cannot be obtained as an item under any circumstances {{in|java}}, though {{in|bedrock}} fire may be obtained as an item via inventory editing.

=== Natural generation ===
Fire naturally generates in [[fire patch]]es across the terrain of [[the Nether]]. 

Fire also generates on top of netherrack in some treasure room [[bastion remnant]]s.

In [[the End]], fire generates on [[bedrock]] blocks on top of [[End spike]]s, at the same location as the [[End crystal]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
[[Lava]] generated next to flammable blocks can naturally cause fires.

Fire spreads quickly across flammable blocks, and can spontaneously ignite when flammable blocks are near lava, even though many blocks that should be flammable cannot catch fire from nearby lava.

[[Lightning]] strikes can also set fires, regardless of whether they are created naturally, redirected to [[lightning rod]]s, summoned by a [[trident]] enchanted with [[Channeling]], or created using the {{cmd|summon}} command.

Placing an End crystal on bedrock or [[obsidian]] in the End causes fire to appear at the End crystal's location.

The [[explosion]] from sleeping in a [[bed]] in the Nether or the End creates fire, as does the explosion of a [[ghast fireball]] or the impact of a [[blaze fireball]]. Using a charged [[respawn anchor]] in the [[Overworld]] or the End also creates fire from the explosion.

Certain invalid recipes of a [[lab table]] can cause it to be set on fire.{{only|Bedrock|Education}}

== Breaking ==
Fire is immediately destroyed when broken. When the [[shears]] are used to break fire, it doesn't lose [[durability]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Fire|any|drop=0|foot=1}}
Fire drops nothing when it's destroyed.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
[[File:SWPE fire1.png|thumb|Before a fire.]]
[[File:SWPE fire3.png|thumb|During the fire.]]
[[File:SWPE fire5.png|thumb|After the fire.]]
Fire can be placed using [[flint and steel]] or a [[fire charge]]. Fire created on [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]] becomes [[soul fire]].

When placed, a fire burns for a short and randomly determined amount of time. If nothing flammable is adjacent to it, the flames die out. [[Water]] that touches fire extinguishes it.

It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.<ref>{{bug|MC-182709}}</ref>

=== Burning ===
{{redirect|Burning|the enchantment in ''Minecraft Dungeons''|MCD:Burning}}
[[Player]]s and many [[mob]]s burn when exposed to fire or lava, represented by them being on fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly with the flames. While inside a fire block, the fire inflicts [[damage]] at a rate of {{hp|1}} per tick (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second) unless the player or mob has [[Fire Resistance]] or a total [[Fire Protection]] of 7 or higher.{{only|bedrock|short=1}} When the player is on fire outside the fire block, they take damage at {{hp|1}} per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful [[difficulty]], so burning alone cannot kill the player in this difficulty. [[Soul fire]] deals [[damage]] at a rate of {{hp|2}} per half-second, making it more dangerous than normal fire. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the fire (stored in a <code>Fire</code> tag shared by all [[entities]], representing the remaining number of [[Tick|game ticks]] the entity will be on fire, decrementing each tick). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by [[powder snow]], [[rain]], [[water]] or a [[cauldron]]. Mobs that are burning will also be illuminated by the flames in dark areas.

For mobs, as soon as the mob is exposed to fire, its <code>Fire</code> tag will jump from 0 ticks (not on fire) to 160 ticks. This value does not increase the longer the entity spends inside the fire, meaning all mobs will always burn for exactly 160 ticks after leaving the fire.

Players start with a <code>Fire</code> value of -20 ticks, meaning they can spend up to 20 ticks (1 second) inside a fire, leave, and immediately stop taking damage. If the value becomes greater than 0, however, it will be immediately set to 160 ticks, and incremented indefinitely (once every few ticks) the longer the player spends inside the fire. For players in [[Creative|Creative mode]], the value will instead be set to 1 tick, and does not increase over time.

Most [[Item (entity)|dropped items]] that are in fire briefly catch fire and disappear. This includes the item forms of blocks that would not be flammable if placed, including [[obsidian]]. The only exceptions are these netherite-related items: netherite [[tools]] and [[weapon]]s, netherite [[armor]], [[blocks of netherite]], [[netherite scrap]], [[netherite ingot]]s, and [[ancient debris]].

If a mob able to drop [[Drops#Mob drops|meat]] dies while on fire, it drops the cooked version of it, with the exception of [[fish]] that is dropped by [[polar bear]]s{{only|JE|short=1}}. This also applies to the [[zombie]]'s uncommon potato drop; if a zombie dies while on fire and should drop a [[potato]], it becomes a [[baked potato]].{{only|je|short=1}}

Most [[Nether]] mobs are invulnerable to fire and cannot burn. Exceptions include [[skeleton]]s, [[endermen]], [[piglin]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, and [[hoglin]]s. 

[[Zoglin]]s, [[vex]]es, [[agent]]s, [[NPC]]s, [[End crystal]]s, [[warden]]s, and [[wither]]s are also invulnerable to fire.

Burning is not considered a [[status effect]] and therefore cannot be cured by [[milk]].

=== Spread ===
[[File:Fire-safe-building.png|right|thumb|Safe building area around a fire. All of the planks here are flammable, but they are far enough away to be safe from the fire. Any flammable block placed inside this structure can catch fire.]]
Fire spreads over flammable surfaces and can climb up walls, across floors and ceilings, and over small gaps, if a [[player]] is within 8 [[chunk]]s of the fire. More precisely, a fire block can turn any [[air]] block that is adjacent to a flammable block into a fire block. This can happen at a distance of up to one block downward, one block sideways (including diagonals), and four blocks upward of the original fire block (not the block the fire is on/next to). Therefore, if the player is using fire to build a fireplace, caution is needed. Blocks in the way do not prevent fire from igniting blocks above it—so even if the player protects a wooden roof with cobblestone between it and the fire, the fire ignores that cobblestone.

Fire spreads from a still [[lava]] block similarly: any air block one above and up to one block sideways (including diagonals) or two above and two blocks sideways (including diagonals) that is adjacent to a flammable block may be turned into a fire block.

Fire that naturally spreads into a valid [[Nether portal]] frame activates the portal.

==== {{anchor|Burning blocks}} Flammable blocks ====
Fire can spread onto and burn away any flammable block (or in the case of [[TNT]], ignite it). On the other hand, a fire that is not adjacent to any flammable block and not on top of a forever-burning block does not spread, even to another flammable block within the normal range.

In the following table, the higher the ''ignite odds'', the more quickly a block catches fire if the fire is available to spread there. The higher the ''burn odds'', the more quickly a block on fire burns away. These are relative values; actual ignite odds and burn time depends not only on these values, but on [[difficulty]], [[rain]], the age of the fire, the direction of the block relative to the fire, and multiple random values including how long the fire waits between [[block tick]]s and further checks based on the previous factors. Fire spread is reduced if it tries to spread to a block more two blocks higher than itself. Fire spread is further reduced by 50% if the flammable blocks are in a humid biome ([[jungle]], [[bamboo jungle]], [[swamp]], [[mangrove swamp]], [[snowy slopes]], [[frozen peaks]], [[jagged peaks]], and [[mushroom fields]]; {{in|java}}, these are defined in the <code>increased_fire_burnout</code> [[biome tag]]).

==== Non-flammable blocks ====
Non-flammable blocks can be lit but do not burn away, and such fire does not spread. Non-flammable blocks other than [[netherrack]], [[magma block]]s, [[soul sand]], or [[soul soil]] extinguish themselves quickly. In the End, [[bedrock]] also does not extinguish itself.

If a block is flammable, it catches fire from lava. However, certain blocks do not burn away:

=== Extinguishing ===
Fire burns out after a while when on a non-flammable block other than [[netherrack]] or [[magma block]]s; however, punching or hitting the side of a burning block extinguishes the fire on that side, making the ''Fire extinguished'' sound (see below). Hitting fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on the fire also extinguishes it. Water and lava extinguish fires that they flow into, and thrown [[Splash Potion#Splash water bottles|splash]] and [[Lingering Potion|lingering]] water bottles extinguish fires in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.

Mobs on fire are extinguished when in water or in a [[cauldron]] containing it. In the latter case, one layer of water disappears.

Fire extinguishes more quickly if nothing flammable is present, and soon after it consumes a flammable block immediately beneath it.
* Fire has an ''age'' property that determines how it extinguishes, ranging from age 0 when the fire is set, and growing to age 15. For fire older than age 3, if nothing flammable is adjacent to the fire, or if the block below doesn't have a solid top surface, the fire is extinguished by the next [[block tick]]. At age 15, as long as there isn't a flammable block below the fire, a block tick has a {{frac|1|4}} chance to extinguish the fire.

If a fire is exposed to [[rain]], it extinguishes quickly.
* Rain affects fire if it falls directly onto the fire, or into the four adjacent blocks. Specifically, no matter the age, any block tick has a 20–65% chance of rain extinguishing the fire, depending on the fire's age: 20 percent plus 3 percentage points per age of the fire.
[[File:Infinite Fire.png|thumb|251x251px|Fire burning on netherrack creates a perpetually burning fire.]]

=== Eternal fire ===
When lit, [[netherrack]], [[magma block]]s, [[soul sand]], and [[soul soil]] maintain fire forever, unless extinguished by any method except [[rain]]. Bedrock in [[the End]] also burns eternally. Eternal fire cannot exist on the sides of these blocks.

The blocks that can support eternal fire are defined per-dimension, in the [[Tag#blocks_infiniburn_overworld|#infiniburn_overworld]], [[Tag#blocks_infiniburn_nether|#infiniburn_nether]], and [[Tag#blocks_infiniburn_end|#infiniburn_end]] block [[tag]]s.

If <code>/gamerule fire_spread_radius_around_player</code> is set to 0, fire lasts forever until it is put out by the player, and does not spread or affect flammable blocks.

=== Bees ===
Setting fire to a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]] causes the contained bees to be ejected from the block.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*Sometimes, in [[Survival]], when the [[player]] walks into a fire briefly and walks out quickly enough, the player takes minor [[damage]], but does not stay on fire.
*Fire uses two texture files, one for the inner fire and one for the outer fire.
*Each [[End crystal]] continuously generates a block of fire at its location, if the crystal is placed or generated in [[the End]].
*Fire has the third highest number of possible block state combinations, at 512, behind [[Note Block|note block]]'s 1150 and [[Redstone Dust|redstone dust]]'s 1296.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
*Burning mobs have the same animation as Java, yet differently scaled.
*The fire spreading mechanic is based on how it would be prior to [[Beta 1.6|''Java Edition'' Beta 1.6]].
*The sides of the fire model in this edition are rotated like in versions before [[Java Edition 1.8|''Java Edition'' 1.8]].
*When the player is on fire, there is a different burning animation on the screen than {{in|je}} (it partially obstructs view when looking downward).
*Players with [[Fire Resistance]] do not visibly burn when in fire sources.
