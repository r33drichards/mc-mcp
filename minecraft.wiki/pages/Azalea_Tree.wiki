An '''azalea tree''' is a rare [[tree]] that can generate above a [[lush cave]] biome, marking the biome's presence aboveground. They extend their roots underground into the cave beneath.

== Appearance ==
Azalea trees are made of [[oak logs]] and [[azalea leaves]] on the surface. Their trunks grow straight up then on a diagonal halfway up the tree. Their roots consist of [[rooted dirt]] and [[hanging roots]], which reach all the way down to the lush cave.

== Generation ==
[[File:Azalea Tree with Roots.png|thumb|right|upright|The rooted dirt and hanging roots that generate under an azalea tree.]]

Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a [[lush cave]], including inside other caves or in biomes that are not grassy.<ref>{{bug|MC-238499||Azalea trees can generate in any (surface) biome|WAI}}</ref> This can sometimes produce jarring scenery, such as when the trees generate in snowy plains or mushroom islands.

Azalea trees can generate in water up to 2 blocks deep, similarly to 'swamp' oaks. Unlike all other trees, however, the maximum depth is limited by the azalea's unique [[root system]] feature config rather than a 'surface_water_depth_filter' [[Placed feature|placement modifier]]. 

Azalea trees can be grown by using [[bone meal]] on [[azalea]] or [[flowering azalea]]. They do not automatically grow into an azalea tree, so bone meal must be used. Application of bone meal gives an azalea or flowering azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3×5×3 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from azalea trees:

* {{BlockLink|Oak Log}} (harvested with any tool, including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Azalea Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{BlockLink|Flowering Azalea Leaves}} (harvested with shears)
* {{BlockLink|Azalea}} (chance of dropping when breaking azalea leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Flowering Azalea}} (chance of dropping when breaking flowering azalea leaves)
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Oak Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}} (harvested with any tool, including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Hanging Roots}} (harvested with shears)

== Planting ==
{{Expand section|Add information about how the trunk of the tree grows|section=1}}[[Azalea]]s and [[flowering azalea]]s can be planted on:
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
* {{BlockLink|Clay}}
Azalea trees requires a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 5 blocks above the sapling (6 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (an azalea planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow).
Growing an azalea tree replaces the block below its trunk with rooted dirt. This only generates one block of rooted dirt and no hanging roots.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|223829|Azalea/flowering azalea don't create hanging roots under rooted dirt when it create azalea tree|resolution=Works As Intended}}</ref> Azalea trees do not need to be grown over a lush caves biome; they can grow anywhere, like [[sapling]]s.

Interestingly, azaleas and flowering azaleas produce identical trees with the same proportion of flowering leaves.

Azalea trees can grow underwater {{only|BE}}, just like [[mangrove]] trees.

Azalea trees always grow in one of the four cardinal directions with the extra branches offset by one to two blocks to the middle at the third to fifth log layer. They have two branches at the fifth block layer unless grown in a 5×5 cuboid.
