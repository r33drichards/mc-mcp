{{main|Cinematics (disambiguation)}}
To promote various updates and projects, several [[Mojang cinematics]] have been released, typically featuring [[Character|characters]] such as [[Sunny]], [[Efe]], and [[Noor]] going on various adventures. Similar shorts have also been released for spin-off projects, including ''{{MCSM|Mojang cinematics|Minecraft: Story Mode}}'', ''{{MCD|Mojang cinematics|Minecraft Dungeons}}'', and ''{{MCE|Mojang cinematics|Minecraft Earth}}.''

=== Machinimas ===
{{main|Mojang machinimas}}
Prior to the introduction of cinematics, the majority of trailers produced for the franchise consisted of {{Wikipedia|machinima}} animations, a style where video games are manipulated and staged for animation purposes instead of a formal software. Many of these were created by the YouTubers [[Hat Films]].

=== Shorts ===
{{main|Mojang shorts}}
Beginning in 2020, YouTube added a special section of their website to finding "short form" content, in response to political tensions over [[TikTok]]. Several [[Mojang shorts]] have been released on the platform, as well as additional [[Marketplace shorts]].
