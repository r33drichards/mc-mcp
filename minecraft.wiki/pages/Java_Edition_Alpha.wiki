'''Alpha''' was the fifth phase in the [[Java Edition#Development|development cycle]] of ''[[Minecraft]]''. It succeeded Infdev, and was the fourth Minecraft development stage to have some of its versions released to the public. There was only one type of [[game mode]] playable in this version — [[Survival]]. One of Alpha's most striking differences to modern versions of ''Minecraft'' is the bright green color used by all foliage blocks, as [[biome]]s were not implemented at the time.

== History ==
{{redirect|Alpha 1.0.0|alpha versions of [[Pocket Edition 1.0.0]]|Pocket Edition 1.0.0/Development versions}}
Unlike other phases of the game's development, the start of Alpha cannot be exactly pinpointed. The first version to display text "Alpha" in-game was [[Alpha v1.0.1]], released on July 2, 2010. However, upon the release of that version, Notch stated that he "just arbitrarily decided that the previous version was 1.0.0",<ref>[[wordofnotch:763147353|Seecret Friday update the third! OooooOOOoo!]] – The Word of Notch, July 2, 2010</ref> thus making Alpha retroactively decided to have begun on the release of the [[ Java Edition Infdev 20100630-1835|second June 30, 2010]], version of Infdev. Additionally, there is evidence for Alpha having actually begun on June 29, 2010, with Notch mentioning in a June 30 blog post "the version that was called “infdev” up until yesterday",<ref>[[wordofnotch:754325074|And another thing..]] &ndash; The Word of Notch, June 30, 2010]]</ref> thus implying [[Infdev 20100629]] was the first version of Alpha. Infdev 20100629 was the version that added the offline client, and IRC logs show that people were referring to this as "alpha" upon release.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/Minecraft-IRCLogs Adura's IRC logs], 2010-06-29_#minecraft.log, "''Jun 29 16:34:50 <visiON> wtf'' [...] ''alpha?''" ... "''Jun 29 16:41:24 <Quatroking> the alpha only gives me 55 fps''" ... "''Jun 29 16:45:59 <Quatroking> Yeah, it doesn't work in alpha''"</ref>

During the Alpha phase, ''Minecraft'' was updated very frequently due to [[Notch]] working full-time on ''Minecraft'' since June 1, 2010,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224014151/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/560997676/one-month-until-full-time|title=One month until full time!|website=The Word of Notch|date=April 30, 2010}}</ref> and having a small company made later (Mojang).<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212110542/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/1599383480/wait-its-wednesday|title=Wait, it’s Wednesday!?|website=The Word of Notch|date=November 17, 2010}}</ref> Bug fixes and tweaks could happen throughout the week, appearing on the game's [[The Word of Notch|development blog]], with major additions and changes appearing in [[Seecret Updates|'Seecret' Friday updates]], leaving the game's players to discover the included new features.

While mostly continuous in version numbering, there is no current evidence of the existence of Alpha version v1.2.3_03; Notch appears to have skipped directly from Alpha v1.2.3_02 to v1.2.3_04. In addition, there is no version labelled Alpha v1.2.4; it is instead strongly believed to be the case that the existing version alpha v1.2,3_05 was retroactively considered to be this release upon Alpha v1.2.4_01 being made public.

On December 11, 2010, Notch announced that the game would enter the [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] stage of development on December 20, 2010, at which point the price would increase to €14.95.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813083726/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/2175441966/minecraft-beta-december-20-2010|title=Minecraft Beta: December 20, 2010|website=The Word of Notch|date=December 11, 2010}}</ref>

* Multiplayer (Survival). Currently, the only way to connect to a server is to find out the IP of it to connect.
* [[The Nether]] - a realm accessible with [[nether portal]]s that contains blocks and mobs (i.e. [[ghast]] and [[zombie pigmen]] as of yet) not found in the normal world, and allows for fast travel (1 block traveled in the Nether is equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld.)
* [[Biome]]s - different environments that differ as location/chunk/temperature changes.
* The addition of [[redstone circuit]]s, a logical [[wikipedia:Input/output|I/O]] system including [[Mechanics/Redstone/Components#Power components|switches]].
* The following items from the Halloween Update: [[netherrack]], [[glowstone]], [[soul sand]], [[pumpkin]]s, and the [[jack o'lantern]].
* Improved AI pathfinding and spawning.
* New sounds for [[cave]]s and [[mob]]s.
* The addition of [[snow]]y and [[Ice|icy]] terrain, plus craftable [[snow block]]s.
* The addition of [[boat]]s.
* [[Cow]], [[slime]], and [[chicken]]s.
* New music.
* More [[painting]]s.
* Press F1 to remove the inventory display and the player's arm (the HUD, or Heads Up Display).
* While holding down F1, press F2 to take a screenshot. The images are saved in <samp>[[.minecraft]]/screenshots</samp>.
* 40 [[inventory]] slots instead of Beta and later's 36, since one could hold items in the crafting slot.
* [[Fence]]s
* [[Sneaking]]
* [[Fishing rod]]s and [[fishing]]

== Trivia ==
[[File:Alpha spawn bug.png|thumb|Loading a world while the game is out of focus shows that the player originally spawns in the world at Y=0 and then gets teleported up.]]
* [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] was originally known as "Minecraft Alpha", before being retroactively named "Classic" after development on [[Infdev]] completed.
* The player originally spawns in the world at Y=0 and then immediately gets teleported up; creating a world while the game is out of focus shows this.
* Before the Halloween Update, Alpha had several "biomes", such as:
** Woods
** Plains
** Treeless mountain
** Woods mountain
** Beach
** Ocean
** Cactus beach
** Original (land with a medium amount of trees)
** Original mountain
** Overhang
** Cliff
** These are not actually "true" biomes, but various types of landforms the game would generate.
* Upon world creation there was a chance that the world would be a [[Winter Mode|winter world]], consisting of snow-covered versions of the above "biomes".
* On September 18, 2010, the ''Minecraft'' authentication server broke. Notch turned this into a free weekend where everyone could download and play the game.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217181410/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/1145356099/free-minecraft-until-this-gets-fixed|title=Free Minecraft until this gets fixed|website=The Word of Notch|date=September 18, 2010}}</ref> This got ''Minecraft'' lots of free press coverage and made lots of new players buy the game afterwards.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217065850/http://news.bigdownload.com/2010/09/28/minecraft-sees-surge-in-sales-following-unplanned-free-weekend/|title=Minecraft sees surge in sales following unplanned "free weekend"|author=John Callaham|website=Big Download News|date=September 28, 2010}}</ref>
* The price for ''Minecraft'' Alpha was €9.95 (£8.95/US$11.54).
* All versions of the game before Alpha are still regarded as '''old-alpha''' by the launcher, regardless of their development stage.
* 23% of all of the Alpha versions that were made are [[Missing Java Edition versions|lost]].
