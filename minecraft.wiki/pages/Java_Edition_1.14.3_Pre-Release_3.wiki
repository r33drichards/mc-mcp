'''1.14.3 Pre-Release 3''' (known as '''1.14.3-pre3''' in the launcher) is the third pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.14.3]], released on June 14, 2019,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-14-3-pre-release-1?3|Minecraft 1.14.3 Pre-Release 3|June 14, 2019}}</ref> which adds a [[game rule]] to disable [[raid]]s, changes some block placement rules, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[Game rule]]s'''
*Added {{cmd|gamerule disableRaids}} which disables [[raid]]s when set to <code>true</code>.
** When true, the Bad Omen is not removed from a player when entering a village.
** If set to true while a raid is in progress, the raid stops, but the existing raid mobs don't despawn.

=== General ===
'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Bashkir (Башҡортса) language.
* Added Gothic (Gutrazda) language.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Lantern]]s'''
* Can now be placed on [[iron bars]] and [[glass pane]]s.
* Can now be attached below iron bars and glass panes.

'''[[Pressure plate]]s and [[torch]]es'''
* Can now be placed on iron bars and glass panes.

=== Items ===
'''General'''
* Items can once again be repaired by crafting them together, as they could before [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]].
** This used to only be able to be done in a [[grindstone]].
