The '''Code Builder Update''', released as [[Education Edition 1.7]], was a major update to {{el|ee}} released around October 2018, that added features equating to '''[[Update Aquatic]]''' (Phase 2) for Bedrock Edition ([[Bedrock Edition 1.5.0|1.5.0]]). It also includes improved in-game coding.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308191631/https://minecrafteducation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018290372-What-s-New-November-Release-Version-1-7-|title=What's New: November Release (Version 1.7.1)|website=Minecraft: Education Edition Support}}</ref><ref>https://minecrafteducation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001429323-Code-Builder-in-Minecraft-Education-Edition-version-1-7-</ref><ref name="update">{{cite|url=https://education.minecraft.net/blog/download-the-code-builder-update-to-learn-coding-in-minecraft/|title=Download the Code Builder Update to Learn Coding in Minecraft|date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>

== Additions ==
{{main|Bedrock Edition 1.5.0|Bedrock Edition 1.6.0}}
This version also adds features from [[Bedrock Edition 1.5.0]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.6.0|1.6.0]].

'''Agent Improvements ''(based on community feedback)'''''
* {{cmd|remove}}
** Remove [[agent]]s from the world
* Players will be able to show the agent coordinates on the HUD
* {{cmd|summon agent}} now creates or teleports the executor’s agent to the executor.
* New command selectors
** <code>@c</code> to target the executor’s agent, <code>@v</code> to target all agents
** Only players with the permission <code>worldbuilders</code> can target all agents. By default all users will have <code>worldbuilder</code> permissions set to false.
* The usual type filters can also be used to target particular agents, so {{cmd|tp @e<nowiki>[type=Agent,name=Steve.Agent]</nowiki> @s}} for instance would look through all entities for those of type agent whose name is Steve.Agent and teleport them to the executor. For more of a shorthand you could do {{cmd|/tp @v<nowiki>[name=Steve.Agent]</nowiki> @s}} to target a particular person's agent that's not your own
* Added spawn eggs for agents

'''[[Library (Minecraft Education)|Library]] Beta'''
* Allows players to view and download worlds in-game without having to go to our website. Players will see a new button on their home screen called "Library" which leads to a list of dynamically generated "must have" worlds

'''Heads-up-display'''
* Added mouse and keyboard control tips to the in-game HUD, to help players learn the how to move, break/place blocks, etc.
* On by default for teachers and off by default for students, and can be configured in the settings menu.

'''"How to Play" menu'''
* Added Education content to the "How to Play" menu.

'''Educator Resources'''
* A button on the home screen (which will show for teachers only) that takes users to a new resource on our website designed to connect them with the latest and greatest training, lessons and community content

== Changes ==
'''Coding'''
* [[Code Builder]] can now be used in the game rather than via a separate app. Players will be able to launch code builder using {{key|C}} if using a mouse/keyboard or by pressing the agent icon next to pause/chat on the top center of the screen while on touch.
* [https://code.org Code.org] and [https://scratchfoundation.github.io/scratchx ScratchX] will not be present at launch in-game. The Code Connection app can still be used to use these applications.
