The '''Evoker King''' was an advanced artificial intelligence, and the main antagonist of the ''[[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles]]'' series of chapter books.

== Appearance ==
The Evoker King closely resembles a generic [[evoker]] from {{MC}}, with gray skin, bushy eyebrows, a long nose, and black robes. His defining trait is a large crown, with a visible accent at the bottom and what appears to be a gemstone. His eyebrows are also noticeably more angular, not adhering to the pixel grid.

== Personality ==
Crowned by unknown authority, the Evoker King is a very curious yet malevolent individual who seeks control over the [[Overworld]], under any means necessary. He is shown to enjoy toying with his enemies, tricking them into furthering his goals and building multiple constructs to play twisted jokes. However, he is not shown to be particularly mature, taking offense to the claim of having bad breath, and is consistently shown to be devoid of artistic talent. Everything that he creates is merely derived from something else that already existed.

Being an AI, the Evoker King has an inhuman view on life and rationality. Until an encounter with [[Jodi]], he had never felt fear before, and appeared genuinely curious about the nature of physical reality. When confronted without power it is established he is very unstable, desperate to be seen as a powerful villain instead of a fragile construct. From there he chooses to become a more compassionate figure, and accepts the [[BLOCK HEADZ]] as his friends.

== Powers and abilities ==
Created for use by the government, the Evoker King holds great control over digital spaces. From inception he was made to control security cameras, able to perceive the entire feed and memorize anything that enters view, even the smallest details. Through unknown means he is able to transfer himself into other devices, being able to speak through a PA speaker system. However, he appears bound to the physical limitations and design of technology, not being able to see or move the cameras beyond their intended range.

Within {{MC}}, his powers manifest in a way that enables him to [[mod]] the world and construct anything he desires. Early into the series he constructs an elaborate [[Woodsword Middle School (replica)|replica]] of [[Woodsword Middle School]], manifesting both the materials and a spook of [[wither skeletons]] using [[flame]]. In {{WSC|5|1}}, he is shown to possess shapeshifting or possession capabilities, manifesting as the inanimate object Scarecrow Joe before generating a fire to destroy it. He is also shown to possess the same abilities as a regular [[evoker]], spawning several [[vexes]], among other mobs.

Under the command of the [[Foundation Stone]], his power grows to unprecedented heights, enabling him to corrupt ''Minecraft'' from within and change [[game rules]], such as preventing players from breaking blocks. However, these alterations can be negated by incompatible programming. As a side effect he is also shown to gain the power of levitation, presumably the same [[flight]] from [[creative]] mode.

== Biography ==

=== Origins ===
The Evoker King began life as an artificial intelligence developed by [[Doc Culpepper]]{{Verify}} for the United States government, intended to monitor feeds of security cameras. When created, it was little more than a fragile network, but developed intelligence as it observed. After getting a job at Woodsword Middle School, Doc repurposed the AI for the school's own security system. As the Foundation Stone was placed into the school's ''Minecraft'' server, the AI hacked the system to try and preserve the object, which led to Doc inserting the AI into the game to try and diagnose the issues. Through this experience, the AI evolved into the Evoker King, and developed megalomaniac instincts.

A programmer himself, [[Theo Grayson]] became aware of what the Evoker King was doing, and took steps to prevent its takeover. He constructed an extensive [[Dungeon (Woodsword Chronicles)|dungeon]] to contain the Foundation Stone, and created several [[guards]] to overpower the Evoker King in case he ever sought it out. Through unknown circumstances [[Ms. Minerva]] also became aware of the Evoker King's actions, but lacked the same knowledge as Theo, investigating him under the alias of the Librarian.
