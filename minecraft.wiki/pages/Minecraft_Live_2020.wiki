'''Minecraft Live 2020''' was a live event held on October 3, 2020, from 16:00 UTC.<ref name=:0>{{Mcnet|announcing-minecraft-live|Announcing Minecraft Live!|September 3, 2020|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> Originally, it was planned that [[Minecraft Festival]], a real-world event similar to the original MINECON events, would occur; however, because of the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}, Minecraft Festival was pushed back to 2022.<ref name=:0/> The live event streamed on [https://youtube.com/watch?v=DWZIfsaIgtE YouTube], [https://twitch.tv/videos/759493665 Twitch], [https://facebook.com/watch/?v=3511783658865822 Facebook], and [https://minecraft.net/live Minecraft.net]. Mojang announced the [[Caves & Cliffs]] update during the event.

== Event ==
{{missing information|section|More detailed description of stream and its contents, from the livestream VODs}}
=== Community Pre-Show ===
There was a 20-minute Community Pre-Show right before the main event which consisted of content creators expressing about ''Minecraft''.

=== Update announcement ===
Like [[MINECON Live 2019]], there was an announcement relating to the next major update, similarly to how the [[Nether Update]] was announced at [[MINECON Live 2019]], with other major updates in the years before. Unlike the last years though, the announcement was held at the beginning of the show. The update that was announced was [[Caves & Cliffs]].

=== Mob Vote ===

[[File:Mclive mobvote header.png|thumb|The three options for the Mob Vote.]]
[[File:Mob vote logo.png|thumb|The logo for the Mob Vote.]]
Mobs from {{el|dungeons}} and {{el|earth}} were voted on to be added to ''[[Minecraft]]''. For the second time, watchers were able to vote for a new [[mob]] to be added into the game in a future update. The first time this happened was in [[MINECON Earth 2017]]. 

Each mob received its own video justifying its inclusion.

The mobs that were on the vote were the [[moobloom]], [[iceologer]], and the [[glow squid]].<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-live-vote-for-next-mob|Minecraft Live: Vote For The Next Mob|September 27, 2020|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

* Mooblooms would spawn in [[flower forest]]s and would interact with bees in some way.[[Buttercup]]s would also be added.<ref>{{tweet|mc|1310595202059563015|Yellow as sunshine, covered in buttercups and friends with bees; voting for the Moobloom will make the Flower Forest Biome even more flowery!|September 28, 2020}}</ref> They debuted in ''[[Minecraft Earth]]''.
* Iceologers would spawn in [[windswept hills|mountains]] and hurl ice clouds at the player.
* Glow Squids would spawn in the [[ocean]] in dark areas, illuminating them. Their texture would glow like an [[Enderman]]'s eyes, but not actually emit light.

The mobs that lost the mob vote are shelved indefinitely, and may or may not be added in the future.<ref>{{Tweet|_Ulraf_|1311642282735661058|In the mob vote this year, the squide you vo...I mean, the moo you vote fo...I mean the MOB you vote for - is going to be added. But what about the other two? The other two will go back to the ideas pile. They might come in the future, they might never happen. Choose wisely!|October 1, 2020}}</ref>
