The '''taiga''' is a humid and cold [[biome]] comprising a grassland forested with small and large ferns, pale aquamarine-green grass, [[spruce]] and pine trees. [[Fox]]es commonly spawn here.

== Description ==
[[File:TaigaBE.png|thumb|left|A taiga biome {{in|be}}.]]
The taiga's surface is a grassland with a large number of [[fern]]s and [[large fern]]s, and is forested with pine and spruce [[tree]]s, which are the only trees that can generate in this biome. The [[vegetation]] also includes short [[grass]], [[dandelion]]s, poppies and [[sweet berry bush]]es, and takes an aquamarine color tone. The [[water]] coloration has a unique dark turquoise tone {{in|be}}.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], taigas use a coolish humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which slightly fades the distance in an orange tint. Taigas have default atmospherics and lighting similar to temperate biomes, but coolish color grading tints the environment with a colder blue color.

[[Rain]]fall is common and changes to [[snowfall]] above the layer Y=160±8 within taigas due to the humid and cold climate. 

[[Pillager outpost]]s, [[village]]s, and [[trail ruins]] generate in taigas occasionally. These villages are made of spruce [[wood]] materials and often contain gardens with [[poppy]] and [[pumpkin]] farms.

=== Generation ===
Taigas are frequently bordered by [[old growth taiga]]s, [[forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[snowy taiga]]s, [[grove]]s and [[swamp]]s. They may also generate in the same temperature range as [[snowy plains]] and snowy taiga, with [[frozen river]]s running through them;<ref>{{bug|MC-239444||Frozen rivers can generate in the middle of taiga biomes|WAI}}</ref> these taigas are almost guaranteed to have [[lush caves]] underground. Taigas that generate in temperatures of -0.150 to -0.450 are less likely to have lush caves, though it's still possible. In addition, when taigas generate far inland, [[dripstone caves]] may generate underneath them instead.

== Mobs ==
[[Wolves]], red [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s, [[sheep]], [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[cow]]s spawn in taigas.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
