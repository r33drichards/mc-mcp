{{Joke feature}}
The '''Minecraft store''' was a joke site created by Notch for April Fools' 2011.

== Accessing the store ==
[[File:Locked Chest Message.gif|thumb|left|256px|Message displayed upon attempting to open the chest.]]

Upon {{Control|use|text=clicking use button}} on a [[locked chest]] in [[Java Edition Beta 1.4]], the prompt shown to the left would appear, and clicking on the "Go to store" button would forward the player to the Minecraft store at https://minecraft.net/store/loot.jsp.
{{-}}

== Store features ==
Sixteen items were "sold" in the Minecraft store ([[#Items "sold"|jump to section]]), often humorously named.

Upon clicking on the proceed to checkout button, the site would trigger a jumpscare in which a Velociraptor from the movie ''[[wikipedia:Jurassic Park|Jurassic Park]]'' growled proudly and flew across the screen. Once clicked, the "Proceed" button also changed its display name to "Fiddlesticks!!!1".{{sic}}

Entering items totaling over $10,000 into the cart caused to screen to start flashing. This was later changed to add a window pop-up that would ask if the visitor was prone to seizures, and clicking Cancel would prevent the effect from activating.{{info needed|The following info from the Easter eggs page contradicts some of this information: "Entering items totaling over $10,000 into the cart causes a window pop-up asking if the player is prone to seizures. Clicking "OK" or "Cancel" made the screen start flashing, causing every element to flash multi-color. ..l Later, the window pop-up said, "If you are prone to seizures, press cancel." This was done likely to avoid exposing photosensitive players to the rapidly changing color flashes."}}

The store page also used the font ''tf2build.ttf'' from Team Fortress 2 which is downloadable from [http://www.dafont.com/tf2-build.font here].

== History ==
On April 2 (the day following April Fools), the store had the addition of a multicolored banner which read "♥ April Fools'! ♥",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110402233948/http://www.minecraft.net:80/store/loot.jsp Welcome to the Minecraft Store!] <small>(archive)</small> – Minecraft.net</ref> accompanied by a [[wikipedia:MIDI|MIDI]] instrumental of Rick Astley's 'Never Gonna Give You Up'. [[Tobias Möllstam]] stated that this was "the best script he's written to date."<ref>{{tweet|mollstam|54171754385514496|Yup, definitely the best script I've written to date. http://minecraft.net/store/loot.jsp|April 2, 2011}}</ref>

The Minecraft store was later removed, and now is a 404 page. An archived version of this page can be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20110401175108/http://www.minecraft.net/store/loot.jsp here].

== Trivia ==
* The store, as well as the locked chests which link to them, are a reference to the ''Mann Co. Supply Crates''<ref>[http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate Mann Co. Supply Crate on TF2 Wiki]</ref> from [http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Team_Fortress_2 Team Fortress 2]. These crates, obtainable through the [http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Item_drop_system item drop system], require a key to open; said key [[wikipedia:Microtransaction|must be purchased]] for $2.49 in the in-game shop called ''Mann Co. Store'' in order to open the crate.<ref>[http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Mann_Co._Supply_Crate_Key Mann Co. Supply Crate Key on TF2 Wiki]</ref> 
* This may have been what Notch was talking about in his Twitter post about a "silly secret project".<ref>{{tweet|notch|45973254095126528|Tomorrow, I'll be working on a silly secret project that will last all weekend. It's Minecraft related. I should sleep, but #jetlag|March 10, 2011}}</ref>
* The 5-key pack is actually $3 more than 5 single keys, the difference worth a sixth key.
* The archived page is available in reduced functionality [http://web.archive.org/web/20110401175108/http://www.minecraft.net/store/loot.jsp here].
* The script that caused the Velociraptor to appear contains a reference to the [[wikipedia:Konami Code|Konami Code]]:

<syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
// Determine Entrance
if(options.enterOn == 'timer') {
	setTimeout(init, options.delayTime);
} else if(options.enterOn == 'click') {
	_this.bind('click', function(e) {
e.preventDefault();
if(!locked) {
	 init();
}
	})
} else if(options.enterOn == 'konami-code'){
var kkeys = [], konami = "38,38,40,40,37,39,37,39,66,65";
$(window).bind("keydown.raptorz", function(e){
kkeys.push( e.keyCode );
if ( kkeys.toString().indexOf( konami ) >= 0 ) {
	init();
	$(window).unbind('keydown.raptorz');
}
}, true);
</syntaxhighlight>
