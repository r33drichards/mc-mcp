{{q|WHAT IS JAPPA DOING TO MY MINECRAFT?

Changing the textures! Except for a few, like the Creeper.

Across all versions? YEP, both on Java and Bedrock. You cannot escape my sweet, sweet textures.

When? Soon! In the Beta Resource Pack, where all my beloved pixels live. |[[Jasper Boerstra]] <ref name="twitter">https://web.archive.org/web/20181210033947/https://twitter.com/JasperBoerstra/status/928968321277530113</ref>||Jasper_Boerstra_Mojang_avatar.png}}
