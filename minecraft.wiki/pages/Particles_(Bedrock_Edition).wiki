'''Particles''' are special graphical effects in ''Minecraft'' that are created when certain events occur, such as [[explosion]]s, [[rainfall]], or [[smelting]] items in a [[furnace]].

== Behavior ==

Particles are rendered as front-facing 2D sprites, meaning they always face the [[player]]. They disappear after a short animation, in which they may change sizes and rotate, and cycle between a number of animation sprites. They collide with solid [[block]]s and are slowed by [[cobweb]]s, but are unaffected by other [[entity|entities]].

Each particle has unique MERS values defined in a texture set used in [[Vibrant Visuals]]. Most particles have different roughness values per pixel all other channels set to 0, but some particles have subsurface scattering or are emissive. See {{Slink|2=Texture files}} for all particle MERS textures,

The {{cmd|particle}} command can be used to create particles.

Particle textures are stored in [[Particles.png|<code>particles.png</code>]], and some particles use their own texture atlas.

=== Emitters ===
Some particles are produced by separate technical particles known as "emitters". The emitter is the centerpiece of the particle effect and is responsible for spawning particles.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/particleeffects?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Particle Effects|website=Microsoft Learn|date=September 20, 2023}}</ref> The emitter defines how many particles are spawned per second for as long as the emitter exists, at the position of the emitter. Emitters themselves are invisible.

== Types of particles ==
The types of particles and their ID names are displayed below. Particles are name spaced with the prefix {{code|minecraft:}}.

== Trivia ==
*Most particles can have their appearance completely changed by resource packs.
*Status effect particles appear where the player face is pointing.
*[[Redstone repeater]]s emit particles, but [[redstone comparator]]s do not.	
*[[Burning]] entities used to emit rounded particles with a fire animation, however now this particle is only used for blazes, and the fire animation has been replaced with one similar to that of Java Edition.
*When lava or water is placed above [[pointed dripstone]] to fill a [[cauldron]], {{code|stalactite_lava_drip_particle}} or {{code|stalactite_water_drip_particle}} particles drip off the dripstone, except right before the lava or water in the cauldron goes up a level, when {{code|lava_drip_particle}} or {{code|water_drip_particle}} particles are used instead.
