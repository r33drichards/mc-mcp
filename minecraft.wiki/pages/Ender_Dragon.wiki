{{relevant tutorial|Defeating the Ender Dragon}}
The '''ender dragon''' is a giant flying hostile [[boss mob]] found when first entering [[the End]]. It is the largest naturally spawning mob in the game. Its attacks involve charging at the player and shooting [[fireball]]s that create damaging [[Area effect cloud|effect clouds]]. The ender dragon can be re-summoned by placing four [[End crystal]]s around the [[exit portal]].

Defeating the ender dragon the first time activates the exit portal which allows safe return to the [[Overworld]]. Each time it is defeated, an [[End gateway]] is created on the outskirts of the central island which can be used to teleport to the [[outer End islands]].

== Spawning ==
=== Initial spawning ===
The ender dragon spawns 20 [[game tick]]s (1 second) after an entity first arrives in the End, along with the bedrock frame for the exit portal.

=== Re-summoning ===
[[File:End Crystals on the Exit portal.png|thumb|How to arrange End crystals on the exit portal to respawn the ender dragon. The exact placement does not matter, as long as one End crystal is placed on each side of the exit portal.]]
Players can re-summon the dragon by placing four [[End crystal]]s on the edges of the [[exit portal]], one on each side. If the exit portal is ever destroyed, End crystals can be placed on obsidian blocks placed where the bedrock of the original exit portal once stood. ({{IN|Be}}, the crystals can be placed one block further away.{{more info|one block further on what axis - outwards?}})

<gallery>

Ender dragon respawn - obsidian version.png|The End crystals may be placed on obsidian instead of bedrock.
</gallery>

When it is re-summoned, the four End crystals point to the tops of each pillar, setting off a series of explosions that resets the obsidian pillars, iron bars, and End crystals. The top of each pillar explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. Eventually, all of the End crystals point at the [[coordinates]] of (0.0, 128, 0.0) and the ender dragon spawns there. The four crystals placed around the [[exit portal]] then explode. The whole sequence lasts a bit over 30 seconds (exactly 604 ticks).

If any of the End crystals placed around the [[exit portal]] are destroyed, the summoning sequence is canceled.

During the summoning sequence, the End crystals on top of the [[End spike]]s cannot be destroyed.

If the player does not pick up the dragon egg and starts to re-summon the dragon, the dragon egg disappears.

If the dragon goes through an [[End gateway]], another immediately spawns at (0, 128, 0) while the other dragon flies to (0, 128, 0).

== Death and drops ==
After the ender dragon is slain for the first time, the following events take place:
* First, it moves to the highest dragon-immune block in the (0,0) column, which is typically the top of the exit portal. During this final move, the dragon can still damage other entities, despite being "dead".
* Once it reaches (0,0), it changes model and slowly ascends, its wings and body becoming more tattered until it disappears in beams of light erupting from its center. A loud sound, <samp>Ender dragon death.ogg</samp> is played. This takes 10 seconds. During this ascension, the following occurs:
** Starting {{convert|7.7|seconds|tick}} after the dragon begins ascending, a total of {{xp|12000}} [[experience]] points (ten drops of 960 and one drop of 2400) appear out of the dragon's body (one by one, per tick) &mdash; enough to bring a player from no experience all the way up to level 68. Some of the experience orbs can drop into the exit portal and can then be retrieved in the Overworld.
** Shortly thereafter, exactly {{convert|10|seconds|tick}} into the animation, the following occurs:
*** The bedrock structure fills in with End portal blocks to become the [[exit portal]], enabling the player to transport back to the [[Overworld]] and [[respawn]] at their spawn point, or at [[world spawn]] if they didn't set a [[spawn point]]. If the exit portal doesn't exist at the expected location (for example, if it was destroyed in Creative Mode), a new one is created there.
*** A [[dragon egg]] appears above the island's central bedrock structure. If a block exists right above the center of the central bedrock structure, then the dragon egg spawns 1 block above the highest block at (0,0). If the highest block is at the height limit, then the dragon egg does not spawn.
*** An [[End gateway]] portal is generated 96 blocks away from the exit portal always floating at Y=75.

When a re-summoned ender dragon is slain, the same events occur, except that only {{xp|500}} experience points are dropped{{only|je}}, and if there are already 20 End gateway portals, no more are generated. {{IN|java}}, the dragon egg appears only the first time the ender dragon is slain; {{in|bedrock}}, it appears the first and second time (due to a bug).

== Behavior ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Defeating the Ender Dragon}}
During the battle with the ender dragon, unique music called "[[Music#End music|Boss]]" plays, the edges of the screen darken, black [[fog]] appears, and [[chunk]]s around the exit portal are constantly loaded regardless of simulation distance. These happen as long as there is at least one player within a Euclidean distance of 192 blocks from (0.0, 128, 0.0).

The ender dragon has a light purple [[boss bar|health bar]] that appears at the top of the [[player]]'s screen. Its health is restored by nearby End crystals, indicated by a white beam connecting the dragon and the crystal. Destroying an End crystal that is actively healing the dragon causes {{hp|10}} damage to it. 

The ender dragon only takes damage from explosions and players (including [[command]]s). The ender dragon is immune to fire, falling, drowning, freezing, poisoning, lightning, the void, and arrows when perching. The dragon is immune to all [[status effect]]s, except for Instant Damage coming from the players (player-thrown [[Splash Potion|splash]] or [[Lingering Potion|lingering]] potion of Harming). When hit on any part that is not its head, the damage it takes is reduced to <code>original damage ÷ 4 + min(1, original damage)</code>, thus damage taken by the dragon is increased when the original damage is less than {{hp|1.33333333........}} or 4/3, and is reduced otherwise. {{IN|bedrock}} the dragon has similar armor but it is temporarily removed when a projectile hits its head.

The damage modification is applied to all damage types the dragon takes, including [[starvation]] and [[void]] damage, which are only possible with {{cmd|damage}}.

{{IN|JE}}, although the particles are displayed, [[critical hit]]s do not apply to the ender dragon, since it can be applied only to [[living entities]]. While the ender dragon is a living entity, the parts that are damaged are actually non-mob entities. Suffocation is completely non-applicable, as it either phases through or immediately destroys any block it touches.

[[File:ender dragon green hitboxes.png|thumb|The green hitboxes of the ender dragon.]]
By using the {{key|F3+B}} shortcut, the dragon's [[bounding box]] appears.{{only|java}} However, it cannot be damaged at just any spot in this large volume: eight green sub-[[Tutorial:Hitboxes|hitboxes]] are also shown, which indicate the locations where the dragon can take damage: the tail, body, head, and wings.

[[Name tag]]s cannot be used on an ender dragon.

Ender dragons killed by {{cmd|kill}}{{only|je}} or [[Commands/damage|from damage]] belonging to the type <code>self_destruct</code>, and was not spawned from the [[player]]{{only|be}}, will skip their death animation and the [[exit portal]] will immediately open; {{in|be}}, if the dragon was killed by {{cmd|kill}} it will stay in the same place and play its death animation there instead of flying to the exit portal.

The purple eyes and mouth of the ender dragon are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]] enabled.

=== Movement ===
The ender dragon is a flying mob and cannot stand on the ground. It flies around the End's main island.

The dragon can pass through all [[block]]s and destroys most of them, but it can still be affected by flowing [[water]], [[lava]], and [[bubble column]]s. Blocks not destroyed are those that naturally generate on the central End island, such as End stone, and those that are intended to be indestructible, such as bedrock.

The following blocks will not be destroyed if the ender dragon passes through them:

* {{BlockLink|Barrier}}
* {{BlockLink|Bedrock}}
* {{BlockSprite|chain-command-block|link=Command Block#Chain}}{{BlockSprite|command-block|link=Command Block}}{{BlockSprite|repeating-command-block|link=Command Block#Repeat}} [[Command block]]s

* {{BlockLink|Allow}}{{Only|be|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|Deny}}{{Only|be|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|Border}}{{Only|be|short=1}}
{{IN|java}}, these blocks are marked under the <code>dragon_immune</code> [[tag]], with the exception of light blocks and fire, which are marked as <code>dragon_transparent</code>.

Destroyed blocks are not [[drop]]ped, but containers other than [[shulker box]]es and [[ender chest]]s drop their contents.

=== Attacking ===
[[File:Dragon breath attack.png|thumb|right|The dragon performing its toxic breath attack.]]
[[File:Java Edition dragon phases.svg|thumb|Arrows indicate possible phase transitions in ''Java Edition''. Circles are triggered by external events and will override the current phase.]]

The dragon never targets any entity but the player, although other mobs may turn hostile to the dragon when hit, and the dragon may sometimes retaliate against other mobs if it takes damage to a projectile. Any entities hit by its wings are dealt {{hp|5}} damage (or {{hp|10}} damage if hit by its head), and {{in|java}}, are thrown into the air, sometimes to fatal heights or off the island. Neither of these effects is applied for {{frac|1|2}} second after the dragon takes damage.

The ender dragon has four main states of behavior: 

; Guarding
* The dragon begins in this state, circling the ring of obsidian pillars on either the outside if there are still End crystals or the inside if the crystals are destroyed.
* With each crystal's destruction, it takes damage and there is an increased chance of the dragon switching states.

:; Targeting
:* Whenever the dragon finds itself less than 10 blocks or more than 150 blocks from its current target, it attempts to choose a new target. When damaged it targets a point just behind itself, causing it to turn away and choose a new target.

; Strafing
* Upon the destruction of an End crystal, the dragon switches to strafing. As soon as it is within 64 blocks, it shoots a [[#Dragon Fireball|fireball]] at the player.
* ''The dragon resumes circling after this state.''

; Diving{{only|be}} <!-- There is no diving state in Java Edition's code. -->
* The dragon dives onto the target player's position, taken at the start of the dive. The dragon never seems to perform this attack mid-flight in game, it only seems to do it when exiting the portal.
* ''The dragon resumes circling after this state, whether or not it actually hit the player.''
* Does not happen on ''Java Edition'' due to a bug.<ref>{{bug|MC-197201||The Ender Dragon does not dive toward the player (missing "diving" attack).}}</ref>

; Perching
* While guarding and the dragon has reached the end of the path, it has 1 in (3 + crystals alive) chance (~7.7% up to 33%){{info needed|bedrock=1|dragon perches much more often in BE than JE?}} to go to the exit portal structure (approaching from the side opposite the player if possible) and lands on the highest block of the coordinates (X=0, Z=0), up to (Y=101).{{Only|BE}} The dragon circles above the exit structure while slowly descending {{In|je}},<ref>{{bug|MC-271336||Ender Dragon dive to portal is broken after 19w08b.}}</ref> or dive from the obsidian pillars {{In|be}}. If there is no block in (X=0, Z=0) the dragon flies down to (Y=0) and "perches" there {{In|je}}, or freezes right when it switches to perching {{In|BE}}. The dragon is immune to arrows and thrown tridents in this state; they catch fire and bounce off.
:; Dragon's breath
:* After 1.25 seconds, if a player is within 20 blocks of the exit portal structure, the dragon roars and use its ''3-second breath attack'', damaging players similarly to a [[lingering potion]] of [[Harming]]. This does not happen on Peaceful difficulty {{In|je}}. An area of visible particles in the shape of a horizontal disc one block tall and 5 to 6 blocks in diameter appears where the breath attack strikes, either on the ground or floating in the air, at whatever point the breath attack struck a block. The harming effect zone where the player takes damage is confined to a smaller area in the center this visible cloud, covering about 3 to 4 blocks.
:* The harming effect portion of the purple clouds emitted from the dragon's breath attack can be collected in a [[glass bottle]] to obtain [[dragon's breath]]. Each bottle of dragon's breath collected removes one block from the lingering damage zone of the breath attack. The visible clouds remain for 3 seconds whether the dragons breath is bottled or not. By rapidly collecting all of the harmful blocks, usually around three, even a direct hit from the breath attack can be mostly and even entirely negated before the player suffers any damage.
:; Charge
:* If the player is not near the portal within 5 seconds of the dragon's landing, it charges at the closest player within 150 blocks with a line of sight from the dragon's head.{{Only|be}} {{IN|je}} line of sight is not required. <!-- The dragon can charge at players that it cannot see in Java Edition. -->
:; Take-off
:* After four consecutive breath attacks, or if the dragon fails to locate a player within 150 blocks, it takes off from its perch. {{IN|java}}, it always takes off in Peaceful difficulty, making it difficult to land melee hits.
:* ''The dragon resumes circling after this state.'' 
:;Escape
:*If cumulative damage taken while perched exceeds {{hp|50}}<!-- 25% of max HP -->, the dragon takes off and resets the damage accumulator. The accumulator is not reset if it does not take enough damage.
:* ''The dragon resumes circling after this state.''

When the dragon takes a fatal blow, it flies toward the exit portal structure before dying, unless it cannot find it within 150 blocks, or it is inside blocks.

'''Dragon fireballs''' are special [[fireball]]s that the ender dragon fires. The ender dragon always fires one dragon fireball for each End crystal destroyed by the player, and also fires them periodically. Unlike [[ghast fireball]]s, they cannot be deflected and do not deal any [[damage]] or [[knockback (mechanic)|knockback]] on impact with an entity. Instead, they deposit purple [[Lingering Potion#Creating area effect clouds|effect clouds]] across the ground that damage players the same way a lingering [[potion of Harming]] II does. This means that the ender dragon's fireballs deal magic damage, which ignores any damage reduction from the player's armor. However, its damage is reduced by the [[Protection]] enchantment. The purple effect cloud's hitbox slowly grows larger in diameter until it disappears.

As with its close-ranged breath attack, the purple clouds can be bottled to obtain the [[dragon's breath]].

Unlike lingering potions of Harming, the effect cloud does not shrink when affecting mobs.

=== Command details ===
[[File:Dragonfireballimpact.jpg|thumb|A dragon fireball spawned by a command (left) and the damage from the explosion it caused (right).]]
{{IN|java}}, the {{cmd|summon ender_dragon}} command, by default, summons a harmless ender dragon that hovers in place. Setting the <code>DragonPhase</code> tag (by issuing either the {{cmd|summon ender_dragon ~ ~ ~ {DragonPhase:0} }} or the {{cmd|data merge entity <selector> {DragonPhase:0} }} commands) starts the ender dragon's ordinary behavior, although the health bar does not appear because it is managed by the ender dragon fight status rather than by the dragon entity itself. If spawned away from the center of the map (x=0, z=0), it flies to the center then resumes normal behavior (see [[#Behavior]]).

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* If low enough on health, the ender dragon emits beams of light without dying, as if cracked.
* The ender dragon's hitbox, especially its wings, is larger than the ender dragon itself, causing players to be pushed away from it from farther away than usual.
* If the player kills a summoned dragon in the [[Overworld]] or [[the Nether]], it does not create the [[exit portal]] or a [[dragon egg]].
* In [[Spectator]] mode, the [[player]] cannot view the perspective of the ender dragon, unlike any other mob. However, it is possible through the use of commands (like {{cmd|spectate}}). When this happens, the player's camera appears about 1 block over the dragon's body.
* {{IN|Console}}, the ender dragon's death sound is bass-boosted.{{verify}}
* Using {{key|F3+B}}{{only|je|short=1}} to show hitboxes reveals that the ender dragon's head rotation faces in the opposite direction to where its real head faces. This is also why the ender dragon faces the wrong way when set in a monster spawner.
* When an ender dragon is spawned in the Overworld, it flies to coordinates X=0 and Z=0 and dives at the ground or does the same behavior as if in the End. If End crystals are placed in the Overworld, they heal the dragon as normal, but it does not perch anywhere and continues to fly around forever.
* {{IN|Bedrock}}, there is an unused texture file for a dragon fireball item.
* In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', one of the spirits that comes with the Steve/Alex DLC is the Ender Dragon. It appears as a Legend-class "spirit" that makes the user breathe fire for a long time at the start of each battle.
* If [[commands]] or [[Creative]] mode are used to get [[End portal frame]]s and [[eyes of ender]], a player can skip to the [[End poem]]. 
** If a player destroys [[End crystal]]s or even hurts the dragon and then uses a player-made portal, upon returning, the player will retain their progress.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* There is a death message that reads "<player> was roasted in dragon's breath", for getting killed by the dragon fireball, that is currently unsendable due to a bug.<ref>{{bug|MC-84595||"Roasted in dragon's breath" death message does not appear when player is killed by dragon's breath}}</ref>
* The ender dragon was originally meant to play a large part in {{AMCM}}, <ref>{{citation|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/peter-sollett-warner-bros-minecraft-1203105640/|title=Peter Sollett to Direct Warner Bros.' 'Minecraft' Movie (Exclusive)|website=Variety|author=Justin Kroll|date=January 11, 2019|https://web.archive.org/web/20190112061341/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/peter-sollett-warner-bros-minecraft-1203105640/}}</ref> but would still be mentioned in {{AMCM|I Feel Alive}} as a past adversary of {{AMCM|Steve}}.
* In the [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]]'s e-manual, the fireballs the ender dragon spits are referred to as "Ender Acid", and its breath is referred to as "Acid breath".

=== Notch-related ===
* On Reddit, Notch suggested the ender dragon's name to be "Jean?" in the same manner he called the [[player]] "Steve?".<ref>{{reddit|l9m8m/why_ender_dragons_wont_spawn_in_main_world|c2qxl5z|name=dragonspawn}}</ref>
** [[Dinnerbone]] later stated that he thinks the name is officially "Jean?".<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|558263033173389313|Officially I think it's "Jean?" ;D|January 22, 2015}}</ref>
** Despite this, an article on Minecraft.net states that  "uttering its true name would unleash a destructive force that would obliterate not only the End, but the Nether and the Overworld at the same time."<ref>{{mcnet|taking-inventory--name-tag|Taking Inventory: Name Tag|March 15, 2019|Duncan Geere}}</ref>
* Also on Reddit, Notch referred to the ender dragon as a she<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/l9ubb/ender_dragon_has_been_named/</ref>, and the Xbox avatar item [[:File:Xbox-360-avatar-ender-dragon-pet.png|Ender Dragon Pet]] purporting to be her brother has the description "A cuter, friendlier version of his bigger, less playful Minecraft sister"; however, it has been later confirmed by Notch,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120728170757/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft</ref> [[Brandon Pearce]]<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1321887816742219776|All mobs in Minecraft are genderless :)|October 30, 2020}}</ref> and [[Jeb]]<ref>{{ytl|pDBf_IKEq3s|Ask Mojang: Holiday Special with Jeb and Lydia @3:26|Minecraft|December 24, 2020|t=206}}</ref> that all mobs in ''[[Minecraft]]'' have no gender, which includes the ender dragon.
** Despite this, the ender dragon continues to be referred with feminine pronouns {{in|BE}}'s in-game encyclopedia. In addition, certain universe canons still refer to the ender dragon with feminine pronouns.
* Before it was textured, Notch reported that he was afraid to texture the ender dragon as it was a complicated model.<ref>{{tweet|notch|122600570170249216|I am a bit afraid of texturing the dragon. It's a very big model. I am going to need unhealthy food for this.|October 8, 2011}}</ref> In the end, the dragon model was so complex Notch stated that he gave up making the texture manually and wrote a texture packer tool to aid him in adding the texture to the model. Notch also uploaded the code for the tool so others could use the pack. ([http://pastebin.com/0AcY6YV2 Link to the texture packer])<ref>{{tweet|notch|122978062143979522|Finally gave up on doing it manually and wrote a texture packer tool.|October 9, 2011}}</ref>
** Notch joked about how ''Minecraft'' was "going next-gen" when deadmau5 mentioned this.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160603021555/https://twitter.com/notch/status/122980577832992768 "Yeah, we're going next gen here!" - @notch] on Twitter; October 9, 2011</ref>
* Notch has uploaded a video showing why ender dragons do not spawn in the main world, as they would destroy any block they touch.<ref>{{ytl|XTpFDRZExAg|Why Ender Dragons won't spawn in the main world|mojnotch|October 12, 2011}}</ref>
** On Reddit, Notch explained that ender dragons destroy Overworld matter because "trying to make an AI to properly navigate arbitrary terrain before the code freeze next tuesday{{sic}} isn't feasible".<ref>{{reddit|dragonspawn|c2qx6qk}}</ref>
