{{Relevant category|Non-renewable resources}}
A '''non-renewable resource''' (as opposed to a [[renewable resource]]) is a resource that cannot be obtained in indefinite quantities in [[Survival]] without using certain glitches, [[commands]], or [[Creative]] mode to create more of them. While running out of resources other than the unique [[dragon egg]] is not likely to be a factor in normal gameplay due to the massive size of a ''Minecraft'' world, in principle there is a finite quantity of these resources available in each ''Minecraft'' world.

== Obtaining ==
Non-renewable resources can be found as naturally generated blocks, obtained from structure loot chests or as [[drops]] from certain mobs that do not respawn (like [[elder guardian]]s), or obtained through crafting recipes that consume other non-renewable items.

Some resources are non-renewable or even unobtainable if playing on Peaceful [[difficulty]], as hostile mobs do not spawn.

The degree of impact the non-renewability of a resource has on normal gameplay generally depends on how limited the resource is, but on custom maps and [[superflat]] worlds they can have a significant impact.

All [[status effect]]s and [[enchantment]]-item combinations that cannot be obtained in Survival are non-renewable.

Shulker boxes and bundles containing non-renewable items are non-renewable. 
== Generated structures ==

These non-renewable resources are found only as loot from [[generated structure]]s, the blocks the structures are composed of, or as non-renewable drops from mobs that generate with the structures, and cannot be obtained in other ways. This renders most of them unavailable in worlds with the "Generate Structures" option disabled{{only|java}}, with the exception of the items that can be found in [[monster room]]s or [[desert well]]s, which are unaffected by the option.<ref>{{bug|MC-77787|||Won't Fix}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-143151|||Won't Fix}}</ref> These resources are generally the most finite resources in the game, though some are relatively common.

=== [[Enchantment]]s on items without prior-work anvil penalty ===

While all enchantments obtainable in Survival other than Swift Sneak and Wind Burst are renewable, for [[treasure enchantment]]s the only renewable way to get them on most items is by using an [[anvil]] to combine the item with a renewable [[enchanted book]]. Using an anvil in this way causes the item to gain [[Anvil mechanics|prior work penalty]], increasing the cost of future anvil use. Similar limitations apply to some high level enchantments, which cannot be renewably obtained on items with insufficient [[enchantability]] without using an anvil.

This renders most types of items that have at least one of these enchantments without having any prior-work penalty non-renewable. Many of these item variants are unobtainable in Survival, but some of them can be found in the loot chests of various generated structures.

Items in [[bastion remnant]], [[ruined portal]] and [[shipwreck]] loot chests are limited to one enchantment, while items from [[End city]] or [[ancient city]] chests often have multiple. [[trial chambers]] loot contains both types, depending on the type of item and loot table used.

=== Unavailable in Peaceful difficulty ===
Some resources in this difficulty may also become unavailable in Survival, as hostile mobs do not spawn. (Previously mentioned non-renewable or unobtainable resources are removed from the products list).

Going to [[the End]] almost always requires the use of [[eyes of ender]], which are unobtainable in Peaceful difficulty, to activate the [[End portal]], with the chances of requiring none being only 1 in a trillion for each End portal. Therefore, resources exclusive to the End can also be considered unobtainable in Peaceful difficulty.
