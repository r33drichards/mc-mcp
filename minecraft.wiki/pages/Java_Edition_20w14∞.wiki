'''20w14∞''', also referred to as '''20w14infinite''' in the launcher, '''20w14~''' in-game, and the '''Infinity Snapshot''',<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1245366688390021122|You asked; our really fancy machine learning algorithm listened. Introducing Java snapshot 20w14∞: the Infinity Snapshot.<br><br>Download it here, and enter a new dimension:<br><br>↣ http://redsto.ne/infinitysnapshot… ↢|April 1, 2020}}</ref> is an [[April Fools' Day jokes#2020|April Fools' joke]] snapshot, supposedly the first and only snapshot for the "'''Ultimate Content Update'''", released on April 1, 2020,<ref>{{Mcnet|every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft|Every update imaginable coming to Minecraft|April 1, 2020|Per Landin}}</ref> which adds new procedurally generated dimensions that randomize existing elements of the game and several ways to access them. 20w14∞ is a [[wikipedia:Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[20w13b]], which was the most recent snapshot at the time.

Despite being a joke, [[custom dimension]]s and [[custom world generation]] were implemented soon after in [[20w21a]] and [[20w28a]], respectively.

== Additions ==
{{Additions table|Box of Infinite Books|Swaggiest stairs ever|Footprint|A Very Fine Item|Cursor|Funky Portal|An Ant}}

=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Box of Infinite Books Yellow.png|32px]] [[File:Box of Infinite Books Blue.png|32px]] [[File:Box of Infinite Books Red.png|32px]] [[File:Box of Infinite Books Green.png|32px]] [[Box of infinite books]]'''

* The box of infinite books uses the [[resource location]] {{code|minecraft:book_box}}.
* It uses the [[texture]] of [[oak planks]] on all but one face, on which it has its own [[bookshelf]]-like texture randomized based on its location.
* When {{ctrl|used}}, if the block is not on one of its chunk's edge and facing along that edge, a random [[written book]] is generated. This book can be thrown into a [[nether portal]].
** The random books are tied to the [[block]] such that using the same block multiple times always returns an identical book.
*** The title of the random books given by the block is correlated with the location of the block.
*** The title's pattern takes the format {{code|<''chunk X''>/<''chunk Z''>/<''block orientation''>/<''distance to the chunk's edge to the right of the block''>/<''block Y''>}}, so books from the same block always have the same title and content.
** The block naturally generates in the "library" and "isolation" dimensions.
** The books on the texture of the block are of random color.
** The author of every book is "Universe itself", obfuscated, and every book has 16 pages filled with random text.
** Books never drop if game rule {{code|doTileDrops}} is set to {{code|false}}.
** The blue variant is used as the inventory icon.

'''{{animate|Funky Portal (white).png; Funky Portal (orange).png; Funky Portal (magenta).png; Funky Portal (light blue).png; Funky Portal (yellow).png; Funky Portal (lime).png; Funky Portal (pink).png; Funky Portal (gray).png; Funky Portal (light gray).png; Funky Portal (cyan).png; Funky Portal (purple).png; Funky Portal (blue).png; Funky Portal (brown).png; Funky Portal (green).png; Funky Portal (red).png; Funky Portal (black).png|32px}} [[Funky portal]]'''
* Also known as the neither portal.
* Has the block ID <code>minecraft:neither_portal</code>.
* If any written book (regardless of whether obtained from the box of infinite books, a chest, or written by a [[player]]) is thrown into a nether portal, the portal blocks change into funky portal blocks. Entering this portal teleports the player into a new, "randomized" [[dimension]] based on the contents of the book. Books with the same page content will always generate a portal to the same dimension.
** Each dimension has its own unique color of portal blocks.
** After throwing the book into the portal, the book is destroyed. It does not go through the portal after having changed it.
** Rarely, throwing a book into a nether portal can cause multiple funky portal colors.
* Unlike most other block entities, placing a funky portal using the command {{cmd|/setblock ~ ~ ~ neither_portal}} will cause it to have randomized block data (unless specified with NBT tags) rather than none at all.

'''[[File:Cursor.gif|32px]] [[Cursor]]'''
* The cursor block is a block with an animated texture that changes its color every second, toggling between green and black concrete.
** Its [[resource location]] is {{code|minecraft:cursor}}.
** The cursor block makes a stone sound when the block is placed or broken, similar to [[terracotta]] placing sound.
** The block naturally generates in "terminal" dimension as the blinking "_" next to a "[[wikipedia:Drive_letter_assignment|C:\]]" made of lime [[concrete]].
** It appears to be cycling between black and lime [[concrete]] in appearance, which is what the rest of the "terminal" dimension is made of.

'''[[File:An Ant.png|32px]] [[An ant]]'''
* Is accessible only through {{cmd|/setblock}} or similar commands, as it has no item form.
* Uses the [[resource location]] {{code|minecraft:ant}}.
* Simulates {{w|Langton's ant}}.
** If placed on top of black or white [[concrete]], it moves in a deterministic pattern, turning the concrete underneath it into its other variation.
* The ant block is the Turing machine mentioned on Mojang Studios' [https://www.mojang.com website].
* If two ant blocks collide, they merge into one.
* Cannot be pushed by pistons and is blast resistant.
* Naturally generates in the "ant" dimension, where it begins moving immediately.
* Can break bedrock.
* Cannot be obtained using pick block.
* Naturally spawn in "Skygrid" dimension where it doesn't move.
* Keeps moving infinitely. 
* After making a oval-like shape, it makes a "highway" that extends forever in a certain direction.

'''[[File:Swaggiest stairs ever.png|32px]] [[Swaggiest stairs ever]]'''
* A stair variant for the netherite block.
* Uses the [[resource location]] {{code|minecraft:netherite_stairs}}.
* Cannot be crafted.
* Naturally generate in the "missing" dimension as the stairs leading up to the [[chest]].
* Can be found in the "Skygrid" dimension.

'''[[Leftover]]'''
* Also known as the zone.
* Is accessible only through {{cmd|/setblock}} or similar commands, as it has no item form.
* Uses the [[resource location]] {{code|minecraft:zone}}.
* Apart from emitting "Happy Villager" particles, the block is invisible.
* When an entity enters it, it receives {{EffectLink|Blindness}} II and {{EffectLink|Poison}} IV for 3 seconds each.
* It is not possible for other blocks to be placed inside of a zone, nor can [[piston]]s move or destroy it.
* When an item is thrown into it, it'll affect the gravity of the item.
* Naturally generates in the "zones" dimension.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Footprint (item).png|32px]] [[Footprint]]'''
* Uses the [[resource location]] <code>minecraft:footprint</code>.
* Resembles the texture of footprint [[particle]], but has a resolution of 16×16 instead of 8×8 and has transparency.
* Is not available in the [[Creative inventory]] and must be obtained through a {{cmd|/give}} command or similar means.
* Does not have a crafting recipe.
* Found in the "missing" dimension's chest.
* This is a reference to the removed "Footstep" particle, hence in the "missing" dimension.
* This item is intended as a joke directed toward the commands' community where the "Footstep" particle is commonly requested.

'''[[File:Fine item.png|32px]] [[A very fine item]]'''
* Uses the [[resource location]] <code>minecraft:fine_item</code>.
* Its texture resembles the side face of a [[grass block]] with the words "Home Sweet Home" written on it.
* Is not available in the [[Creative inventory]] and must be obtained through the {{cmd|/give}} command or similar means.
* Found in the "isolation" dimension in an item frame next to the bed. 

=== World generation ===
==== Biomes ====
[[File:Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious biome.png|thumb|A randomized biome in a randomly generated dimension.]]
Randomly generated [[biome]]s can be found in the new dimensions.
* Biomes that are discovered by the [[player]] through the changed portals are added to the list of biomes when creating a buffet world, including <code>_generated:''id''</code> biomes.
* A certain sound effect may periodically play without the presence of its normal source throughout a biome, often excessively.
** This also applies to [[music]] as well, sometimes even at different pitches as well (e.g. biomes in the dimension {{code|aide}}).
* [[Weather]] is disabled in some biomes.
* The biomes have randomized [[mob]] spawning.
** [[Mob]]s that do not naturally spawn in the non-random dimensions may appear, such as [[giant]]s, [[wither]]s, [[zombie horse]]s and [[illusioner]]s.
** Many generated biomes do not spawn mobs. [[File:Shulker Generation in Dimension Fry.png|thumb|Large quantities of structures and shulkers generating with end cities in a randomly generated dimension.]]
* The generated biomes can have random structures or structures that naturally generate in other dimensions.[[File:Basalt Spikes.png|thumb|"Basalt Spikes", a random biome that bears resemblance to both the [[basalt deltas]] and [[ice spikes]] biomes in a randomly generated dimension.]][[File:20w14~ Carpet Forest.png|thumb|A biome filled with structures that resemble trees in a randomly generated dimension.]]
** Mobs that spawn with a structure may spawn in larger numbers than usual. There could be a high number of [[elder guardian]]s spawning near an [[ocean monument]] or a high number of [[shulker]]s generating with an [[end city]].
** Often, a biome contains one particular structure in great abundance.
** Sometimes, a dimension repeatedly generates letters, depends on the biome. It is highly probable that the shapes for these characters are from Minecraft's font textures.
* Some random biomes may have some resemblance to a non-random biome. 
* A significant number of the random biomes have large quantities of lag inducing blocks like [[vines]] or decaying [[leaves]] or stacked seeds breaking all at once. These biomes have the very great potential of crashing the game or at least render it unplayable.
[[File:End gateway sample biome.png|thumb|End ships found in the "between" biome.]]
[[File:BusyMine.png|thumb|A deposit of observers found underground in the "busy" biome.]]
[[File:Fire and stairs sample biome.png|thumb|Floating prisms of cobblestone stairs found in the "shapes" biome.]]
Three new pre-made biomes were added.
* '''[[Between]]'''
** Works best with ''Floating Islands'' [[buffet]] world generation.
** Generates a mesh of [[end ship]]s.
** Resource location is <code>minecraft:between</code>.
* '''[[Biome for player with no time for nonsense]]'''
** Works best with ''Overworld'' buffet world generation.
** Generates what seems like a normal [[snowy taiga]], although mineral blocks and [[redstone components]] generate instead of ores.
** Resource location is <code>minecraft:busy</code>.
* '''[[Shapes]]'''
** Works best with ''Floating Islands'' or ''Overworld'' buffet world generation.
** Generates a world consisting of different shapes made of one or more different types of blocks.
** Resource location is <code>minecraft:shapes</code>.

==== Dimensions ====
[[File:Floating islands sample biome.png|thumb|A randomly generated dimension made of floating islands.]]
There are 2,147,483,645 new [[dimension]]s, which means 2,147,483,648 (2<sup>31</sup>) possible dimensions per world seed, giving 2<sup>95</sup> dimension combinations in total, roughly 40 octillion.<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|1245484473338212352|What most people probably didn't realize with the snapshot today, there are not just 2 billion dimensions added to the game. There are 2 billion dimensions per world seed and they are all different. That makes 2^95 combinations (a really large number)|April 1, 2020}}</ref> <!-- All of the below list is unnecessary. -->
* Certain dimensions contain easter eggs (see below).
* Certain dimensions (including easter egg dimensions) have the consistent world generation as in the Overworld within the same world seed.
Various pre-existing and randomly generated biomes appear in the dimensions.[[File:-NX- snowy tundra.png|thumb|A [[snowy tundra]] found in a randomly generated dimension.]]
* Some dimensions may have only one biome, while others have several.
** Even if a dimension has multiple biomes, a dimension can be dominated by a particular biome with all other biomes being exceptionally rare.
* Biomes that are rare in the [[Overworld]] or [[Nether]] can be quite common in the new dimensions.
The blocks that make up various features (e.g. ores, ice spikes, lakes) are randomly swapped.

If a non-random biome appears in a random dimension, mobs expected for that biome generally spawn.
* Usually, aside from [[bat]]s, mobs that do require a particular light level to spawn do not spawn regardless of light level. For instance, in the dimension <code>jeb__</code>, passive mobs and [[slime]]s spawn in the [[savanna]] biome, but no other mobs. 
** There are some exceptions to this. For example, hostile mobs spawn at low lights levels in the dimension <code>interesting</code>, along with a small percentage of other dimensions.
* There are still slime chunks, and slimes spawn in certain biomes.
** When they do spawn, they spawn below Y=40 as usual.
The [[sky]], blocks, menu, player, etc. are randomly tinted.

The sky is from the Overworld, Nether or [[End]].
* For Overworld skies, the [[sun]] and [[moon]] appears in random sizes and the day-night cycle has a random duration.
** In a majority of the dimensions, the sky either cycles rapidly, making a full revolution in exactly five seconds, or it is completely frozen. It is rare for the sky to move at other speeds, but when it does move at other speeds, the cycle duration is randomized.
[[File:Dimension -name- lighting screenshot.png|thumb|An example of the unusual lighting in the random dimensions. [[White concrete]] was placed near the [[void]] in this randomly generated dimension.]]
Some dimensions have [[sky light]], meanwhile others do not have any, even if there is a sun and moon.
* In dimensions without a day and night cycle, the skylight can operate like sunlight and prevent mob spawning, but in other dimensions, it can operate like moonlight and mobs can spawn on the surface.
The lighting in the dimensions can be unusual.
* Sometimes, the same face of every block in the dimension is completely dark (sometimes fully black).
* In some dimensions, blocks are sometimes tinted or recolored in different ways, depending on the block type, block state, or the dimension.
* In some dimensions, the lighting in the dimensions are similar to the [[Overworld]] (including the easter egg dimension <code>gallery</code>).
[[File:Dimension.png|thumb|Unusual blue lighting with random [[particle]] effect in a randomly generated dimension. A random particle effect fills some biomes.]]
* The particle effects appearing in each biome depends on the dimension. In some cases, Overworld biomes can get a particle effect.
* In some biomes in the generated dimensions, randomly generated particles can cause lag depends on the operational system.
The style of generation can be:
* Overworld-style generation with hills and valleys.
** Caves generally do not generate. Lava and water lakes may still generate when there are no other caves.
** The size of the hills and valleys depends on the biome, much like in [[buffet]] generation.
** There is bedrock at the bottom with generation identical to the Overworld.
*** There may occasionally be holes in the bedrock in some of the dimensions.[[File:20w14~ Bedrock Penetration.png|thumb|Example of holes in bedrock in a randomly generated dimension.]]
** A subtype of the Overworld generation is generation that is [[superflat]], but with some differences.[[File:Fry flat type generation.png|thumb|Superflat style generation in a randomly generated dimension.]]
*** Caves may still generate.
*** There can be various layers of a single type blocks. These layers have various thicknesses.
**** In certain dimensions, the layers are not perfectly flat with minor hills and valleys.
*** Bedrock near y=0 is not in a flat layer and instead generates in the same way as the Overworld's bedrock.
*** This type of generation is quite rare.
*** The superflat style generation appears to be a result of water based biomes having blocks swapped. The surface of the superflat biomes is identical to y level of the surface of the ocean.
* Nether-style generation, with a [[bedrock]] ceiling at Y-level 128 and the cave generation that is seen in [[the Nether]].
** Objects may generate above the bedrock ceiling.
* End-style generation, with no bedrock and floating islands.[[File:Interesting sky generation.png|thumb|End type generation in a randomly generated dimension.]]
[[Bed]]s and charged [[respawn anchor]]s explode in the generated dimensions.[[File:Dried kelp mineshaft sample biome.png|thumb|A mineshaft carving through dried kelp in a randomly generated dimension.]]
* However, beds do not explode in some [[dimension]]s, where the beds can be slept in at any time of the day. They set the spawn point much like in the [[Overworld]], but when the beds are slept in, the time is not set to the morning.[[File:Colored fossils sample biome.png|thumb|Floating multicolored fossils in a randomly generated dimension.]]
** The following dimensions where beds do not explode in the generated dimensions (all are easter egg dimensions that are based on the Overworld world generation, of a total of 16 dimensions):
*** "blacklight"
*** "busy"
*** "chess"
*** "colors"
*** "content"
*** "darkness"
*** "decay"
*** "holes"
*** "pillars"
*** "rooms"
*** "slime"
*** "wall"
*** "zones"
*** Colored dimensions (including "red", "green" and "blue")
The ID for each dimension is determined from the SHA256 hash of the name of the dimension with the string <code>:why_so_salty#LazyCrypto</code> appended to it.[[File:RedstoneDimension.png|thumb|The dimension generated by the ID "redstone".]]

In [[end ship]]s in the new [[dimension]]s, chests are generated with [[#General|fleet_orders]] loot table.[[File:OverworldDimesion.png|thumb|The dimension generated by the ID "overworld".]]

In some dimensions, [[compass]]es point toward the center of the world. In others, the needle spins in random directions like in the Nether and the End.

[[Liquid]]s behave differently in different dimensions. In some, the liquids act like they are in the Overworld, and in the rest, they act like they are in the Nether.

[[Undead]] mobs do not burn and [[piglin]]s do not zombify in the random dimensions, even during the day.

[[End portal]]s can be constructed. When entered, the player is teleported to the end, but at the coordinates at which they entered the portal on a newly generated [[obsidian platform]].

[[Map]]s can function correctly as they do in Overworld, but usually a map just shows gray and orange static, much like in the Nether.
* Unlike the Nether, the player indicator accurately displays the player's orientation.
[[Cloud]]s can appear in some dimensions in a layer at some random Y level.

There is [[weather]].
* The current weather is identical in all dimensions. If it is [[rain]]ing in one random dimension, it is raining in all random dimensions and the Overworld, though it does not rain in certain biomes as mentioned above.
Dimensions solely consisting of the biome <code>the_end</code> with [[obsidian pillar]]s at the center of the map are quite common. [[File:dimension Grumm.png|thumb|This dimension is an example of an 'endless end' dimension. The image was intentionally brightened due to this dimension having dark lighting.]]
* When using <code>/debugdim</code> in this type of dimensions, no biomes are listed.
The [[music]] is identical to the Overworld's.

Some dimensions may have fog that makes it difficult to see far distances.

The lighting system between buffet worlds and unique dimensions is different. In the Overworld there can be darkness, while in the easter egg generated dimension there can not be (i.e. "fleet" (<code>minecraft:between</code>) and "shapes" (<code>minecraft:shapes</code>)).

===== Easter egg dimensions =====
There are 43 hard-coded<ref group="note">This means that do not use the random dimension generation described in the above section</ref> [[easter egg]] dimensions in total, accessible through <code>/warp <''name''></code> or by typing the dimension's name as the only word in a signed book or book and quill and throwing it into a nether portal.
* Intended easter egg dimensions can be found in the code, not by their name, but by the dimension ID. For the dimensions that were hardcoded, a dimension ID is also provided (which can be used with <code>/setblock ~ ~ ~ neither_portal{Dimension:<''ID''>}</code>).
* Many of these easter egg dimensions use the same generation as the Overworld, including "red", "green", "blue", "wall", "chess", "colors", and "slime", adding their special features onto it.
* All easter egg dimensions with a specific feature generate the feature near to the origin. If the funky portal the player constructs is not at or near the origin, the portal does not generate at or near the feature in the destination dimension.[[File:Ant2.png|thumb|The pattern created in the "ant" dimension. The "highway" on the right is extended indefinitely beginning after about 10,000 steps.]]

{{Notelist}}

====== [[ant]] dimension ======
* ID: <code>(726931095)</code> or <code>ant</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* A dimension that is initially flat and made of white concrete at Y-level 0, along with one ant block that immediately begins moving and an acacia sign that says "PATIENCE" at (0, 3, 0). The ant block uses {{w|Langton's ant}} algorithm to determine its pattern.
* The sign is a floating wall sign with no support.

====== basic dimension ======
* ID: <code>(236157810)</code> or <code>basic</code>
* Biome: [[Jungle]]
* Has a diagonal maze pattern. It looks similar to simple mazes generated in the BASIC programming language<ref>https://archive.org/details/10print</ref>, with flat blue concrete floor at Y-level up to 16, and light blue concrete maze top surface at Y-level up to 32.
* It appears that the maze consists of one main passage with no branches or dead ends and random squares that can be entered only from the top.

====== blacklight dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1174283440)</code> or <code>blacklight</code>
* A dimension with inverted lighting: entities and blocks are pitch black during daytime and bright in caves or at night, torches darken the area around them and so on.
* Also darkens text and textures of items.
* The sky remains the same light level (with day-night cycle) as it is in the [[Overworld]].
* The world generation is the same as the original world that the player spawned in.

====== brand dimension ======
* ID: <code>(344885676)</code> or <code>brand</code>
* Biome: [[Jungle]]
* A dimension with 8×8 block creeper faces made out of randomly stained terracotta, glazed terracotta, glass, glass panes, wool, carpets, concrete, and concrete powder (Y-levels 0-31).

====== bridges dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1113696725)</code> or <code>bridges</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* A dimension with randomly generated end stone bridges with the bridge surface at Y-level 130.

====== busy dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1028465021)</code> or <code>busy</code>
* Biome: [[Biome for player with no time for nonsense]]
* A dimension entirely made of the "biome for player with no time for nonsense" that generates redstone components and mineral blocks in place of ores. As a result of hoppers generating, this dimension can be laggy on lower-end devices. If created in buffet world, this dimension generates almost exactly as the Overworld.

====== checkerboard dimension ======
* ID: <code>(741472677)</code> or <code>checkerboard</code>
* Biome: [[Desert]]
* A world containing all the dyeable Minecraft blocks - [[concrete]], [[concrete powder]], [[wool]], [[carpet]], [[stained glass pane]], [[stained glass]], [[terracotta]] (excl. normal terracotta), and [[glazed terracotta]] - in 16×16×16 blocks from Y=0 to Y=127. As a result of stained glass panes generating, this dimension can be laggy when the player is brought into view, especially on lower-end devices.
* There are two types of patterns in the dimension - the pattern of colors for each dyeable block and a 64×16×64 area that contains every type of dyeable block in the same smaller patterns. [[File:Warp checkerboard pattern.png|thumb|Color pattern for concrete powder at /warp checkerboard, with part of the concrete and wool "chunks" on either side.]]
** The latter or larger of the patterns is inconsistent. {{testingame|Check for the way the 64×16×64 patterns go next to each other in all directions}} [[File:Large warp checkerboard pattern.png|thumb|The larger 64×16×64 pattern for the types of colored/dyeable blocks.]]

====== chess dimension ======
* ID: <code>(94341406)</code> or <code>chess</code>
* A dimension nearly identical to the overworld, with one exception. If the sum of a block's x, y, and z coordinates is odd, it appears completely black, as if there is no light falling on it. This produces a checkerboard pattern, although unlike the checkerboard dimension, the effect is visual only. Mobs and most other entities are also affected, based on their location.
* This dimension also uses the same world generation as the original world.
* The pattern is three-dimensional.

====== colors dimension ======
* ID: <code>(378547252)</code> or <code>colors</code>
* A dimension divided into 4 quadrants colored red ({{color|#F65314}}, +X +Z), blue ({{color|#00A1F1}}, +X −Z), green ({{color|#7CBB00}}, −X +Z), and yellow ({{color|#FFBB00}}, −X −Z). At an angle, it resembles the Microsoft logo.
** Water and lava are partially tinted black in the green quadrant, while they are fully tinted black in the blue quadrant.
* Yet again, this dimension shares the original world's generation.

====== content dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1201319931)</code> or <code>content</code>
* Biome: [[Plains]]
* An empty dimension with a small skyblock island near spawn with a tree and chest.
* The player spawns on top of the tree at (9, 75, 11). The structure size from minecraft:content is (6 12 7).
* The chest on the island contains a lava bucket, beacon, bucket of pufferfish, pumpkin, sugar cane, melon slice, and a box of infinite books (see below).
* The island is possibly meant to resemble the [[YouTube]] Gaming logo since the dimension's name is "content". [[File:Warp content comparison.png|thumb|Side-by-side comparison of the "/warp content" island and the YouTube Gaming logo.]]

{{Container
|type=chest
|4=Lava Bucket
|5=Beacon
|6=Bucket of Pufferfish
|13=Pumpkin
|14=Sugar Cane
|15=Melon Slice
|23=Box of Infinite Books
}}

====== credits dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1929426645)</code> or <code>credits</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* Full Minecraft [[credit sequence|credits]] text made of [[blocks of netherite]] at Y-level 20. The whole credits ends at coordinate (1972, 20, 3422).

====== custom dimension ======
* ID: <code>(484336196)</code> or <code>custom</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* A dimension with a caution floor pattern (at Y-level up to 15) and two signs that say "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" (0, 18, 0) and "IOU 1x Custom Worlds" (0, 17, 0). This may have been a reference to future snapshot [[20w21a]], which added custom worlds, i.e. [[custom world generation]] and dimensions.

====== darkness dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1210674279)</code> or <code>darkness</code>
* A dimension with no lighting except for around where the player spawns.

====== decay dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1537997313)</code> or <code>decay</code>
* A dimension that appears similar to the overworld except it gets more broken and destroyed the further away from spawn the player goes.[[File:Decay Dimension.jpg|thumb|The decay dimension.]]
* May crash game at high X or Z values.
* The decay effect applies to water as well as solid blocks.

====== fleet dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1896587401)</code> or <code>fleet</code>
* Biome: [[Between]]
* Large fleet of end ships in a grid pattern generated by the between biome added in this snapshot (with four different levels starting at Y = 50, but the fourth is cut by the height limit. Every level is 50 blocks apart from each other).  
* All non-chest loot in normal end ships generates, excluding the elytra.
* If the between dimension is generated in a Buffet World, the layout is different than in this dimension and the custom dimension generates void instead of stone.

====== gallery dimension ======
* ID: <code>(307219718)</code> or <code>gallery</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* A quartz path museum featuring helical-shaped sculptures of random blocks with some having random data values (e.g. if a slab is waterlogged or the plant that appears inside the plant pot).
* The strands of "block DNA" have seemingly random minimum and maximum heights between themselves, however, they do join in the middle and have a mirrored top and bottom (i.e. whatever blocks have been generated above the center are mirrored below it with corresponding y-value differences). The middle is at the same Y-value as the quartz path, which is Y=128. {{testingame|What is the highest possible height between the center and the tips of the helical structures? (So far I found 84 (212-128) as the highest but feel free to find a higher difference if you could.}}

====== notes dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1834117187)</code> or <code>notes</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* A flat dimension made out of noteblocks at Y-level 0 that play random noteblock instruments and pitches despite receiving no redstone power or player input, and lacking any blocks beneath them. The noteblocks stop playing when the player goes into spectator mode.

[[File:Last page dimension.png|thumb|the secret message in the last page dimension]]

====== last page dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1791460938)</code>
* Biome: [[The Void]]
* Correct name: <code>this_is_a_very_long_phrase_that_hopefully_is_not_in_any_dictionary</code><ref>From [[air.ogg]].</ref>
* Called <code>last page</code> in the game's code
** A reference to the [http://hmpg.net/ last page of the internet].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20211203004826/https://imgur.com/a/WeA3Ip6</ref>
* Contains a secret message when entered using the correct name of this dimension.
* Contains "Uh uh uh! You didn't say the magic word!" written in grass blocks when entered without the correct name, which is a reference to the hacking scene from ''{{w|Jurassic Park}}''.
** There are multiple values that can hash to this dimension without the correct name (e.g. the notable <code>/warp abglaiap</code>, <code>/warp myrobod</code>; as well as the sequence of random ASCII characters like <code>/warp cDCCd</code>, or <code>/warp tgTZ&</code>).
* If the correct name is used, the dimension contains the following text, which is a reference to an alien message from the science-fiction book, ''{{w|2010: Odyssey Two}}'':
<dd>{{quote|Hello! Only purpose of this message was to troll completionists and put my name somewhere in Minecraft (again!). I hope it wasn't cracked by accident – it was obviously supposed to take more time than other phrases. Written during time of plague by [[boq]] (yes. lowercase. because symmetry) "All these worlds are yours, except Europa'''*'''. Use them together. Use them in peace. " '''*'''Europa™️* the Moon sold separately.}}</dd>
* This secret message was decoded by visiting a [https://radio.xn--jxe.net/air.ogg streaming media server] created by [[boq]], which at random intervals emit beeping noises that can be decoded as an SSTV image to produce a photo of a notebook with the correct name written on it. These noises are preceded by an excerpt from the "[[Sweden]]" music track.
** The other streamed sounds are [[wikipedia:Numbers station|numbers station]] recordings from ''[[wikipedia:The Conet Project|The Conet Project]]''.
* The correct name can be verified using a [https://gist.github.com/boq/15aa9b6feeb5aa0776393f3a8ea9f712 code snippet] provided by [[boq]].
<!--Shouldn't these be in Trivia or References?-->
* "Time of plague" is a reference to the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}.
* "All these worlds are yours, except Europa™️" is a reference to the 1982 science fiction novel, {{w|2010: Odyssey Two}}.
* The dimension accessed with the book containing the word "Europa" appears to be a randomly generated world full of spruce forests in which barrier blocks make up the majority of the solid areas. This is not an easter egg dimension, and thus it has a different generation for each world seed.

====== tunnels dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1141490659)</code> or <code>tunnels</code>
* Biome: [[The End (biome)|The End]]
* Randomly generated tunnels made out of sea lanterns.

====== wall dimension ======
* ID: <code>(545072168)</code> or <code>wall</code>
* A giant bedrock wall runs along X=0 with an iron door at (0,0). Both sides of the wall resemble the Overworld but with red (positive X) and blue (negative X) tints respectively. Note that water is tinted black on the blue side (negative X).
* Probably a reference to {{w|Maxwell's demon}}.
* If the player breaks the bedrock wall and places grass, the grass (and any other blocks) will be normal color.
* Likewise, if the player brings an animal from one side to the other, its color will switch from the starting color, to normal color, and then into the other side's color.

====== zones dimension ======
* ID: <code>(1916276638)</code> or <code>zones</code>
* A normal dimension with areas of zone blocks in random places of the surface.
* While in a zone, the player will receive Blindness II and Poison IV.

======Colored dimensions ======
These dimensions apply filters based on the {{w|RGB}} values of everything in them.

'''{{color|red}}'''
* ID: <code>(2114493792)</code>
* A dimension where everything is red. This uses a simple filter that only shows the red values of every texture in the dimension.
'''{{color|lime|green}}'''
* ID: <code>(1143264807)</code>
* A dimension where everything is green. This uses a simple filter that only shows the green values of every texture in the dimension.
'''{{color|blue}}'''
* ID: <code>(1049823113)</code>
* A dimension where everything is blue. This uses a simple filter that only shows the blue values of every texture in the dimension.

Exiting to the main screen while in any of the colored dimensions retains some of the effects in various menu elements.

All 3 of these colored dimensions are exactly the same as the normal vanilla overworld, besides the color changes. The game can be beaten in these dimensions.

=== Command format ===
* Added <code>/debugdim</code> command.
** Generates multiple JSON files in the "debug" folder of the world save.
*** A "dim-#" file that includes the dimension's number, the type of generation used, the default block, default fluid, and the biomes within the dimension.
*** One or multiple "biome-#" files that store the data used to generate the biomes that make up the dimension.
** Works in all dimensions, including the Overworld.
** Can also be used without cheats.
* Added <code>/warp</code> command.
** Can be followed by any string or number to warp to a corresponding randomly generated dimension.
*** Warps to the same dimension as a book with the same text thrown into a portal would take the [[player]] to.
*** Always sends the player to the same coordinates in each dimension, at one of the highest blocks near (0, 0) or to (0, 257, 0) if there are no blocks near (0, 0). Warping to the dimension the player is currently in teleports them to the coordinates (0, 0).
** Can also be used without cheats.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancements]]'''
* Added advancement "Almost there", achieved after going through any portal a billion times. The in-game description is "Visited over billion dimensions."
** The advancement is found in the "[[Advancements#Adventure|Adventure]]" tab and its parent is the root advancement. The advancement also has a flint and steel icon.
** The advancement can be granted using {{cmd|advancement grant @s only minecraft:adventure/almost_there}}.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Added statistic "Dimensions changes", which keeps track of the number of times that the player has changed dimensions.
** When the statistic has reached 1,000,000,000, the advancement "Almost there" is granted to the player.
** The statistic's ID is <code>minecraft.custom:minecraft.change_dimension</code>.

=== General ===
'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added <code>fleet_orders</code> loot table.
** Be used for chests in [[end ship]]s in the new [[dimensions]].
** Includes one book titled "Orders" whose author is "[[§]]kDeepest Lore". 
** The obfuscated text can be observed by editing player or chest data in the world save, or by using the {{cmd|/data}} command.
** The content of the book is in the form of "<''verb''> §k<''object''>".
*** The <''verb''> can be one of the following texts:
**** capture
**** destroy
**** cut
**** find
**** obliterate
**** discover
**** observe
**** reinforce
**** build
**** deploy
**** restore
**** deliver
*** The <''object''> can be one of the following texts:
**** cheese
**** footprints
**** bananas

**** mah brewskis
**** bicycle build for two
**** my canoe
**** Minecraft 3D: Lost Floppies
**** content
**** those pesky modders
**** license-free mappings
**** those VHS
**** pre-mixed coctails
**** quasi-connectivity
** Contains a new loot table function:
<div class="treeview">
* '''add_book_contents''' - Generates the contents of a writable or written book.
** {{nbt|string|provider}}: '''"orders"''': Must be set to "orders" to generate the contents detailed above.
</div>

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Inventory]]'''
* [[Block]]s and [[item]]s in the [[Creative inventory]] have been intentionally shuffled.

'''[[Debug mode]]'''
* Has also been intentionally shuffled, like the creative inventory.

'''[[Fishing]]'''
* When fishing, there is a 20% chance that the entity caught will be a non-item entity whose type is randomly chosen:
** [[Salmon]] and [[cod]] each have a {{frac|7|27}} (25.92%) chance of being chosen.
** [[Pufferfish]] have a {{frac|4|27}} (14.81%) chance of being chosen.
** [[Tropical fish]], [[squid]], [[guardian]]s and [[boat]]s each have a {{frac|2|27}} (7.4%) chance of being chosen.
** [[Elder guardian]]s have a {{frac|1|27}} (3.7%) chance of being chosen.

'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added {{code|player}} check to the {{code|changed_dimension}} trigger.

'''[[Note block]]s'''
* Now may play randomly every tick.
* This is probably a feature for the "notes" dimension, which uses a lot of note blocks to create random sounds.

=== General ===
{{more sounds|"Occasionally, it plays a different sound with different voices."}}
'''Loading screen'''
* The [[Mojang]] loading screen has been changed.
** When the game is loaded it displays the company name MOJANG underneath it with a couple of people singing {{sound|"Mojang!"|Bim bom.ogg}} similar to how "Sega!" would be sung on a Sega startup screen. The same sound was also used in [[3D Shareware v1.34]]. It also has some vinyl crackling. Occasionally, it plays a different sound with different voices.

'''World selection screen'''
* Worlds from releases and other snapshots are not visible but can be accessed by launching the game in said releases and snapshots.

== Issues ==
20w14infinite is not supported due to being an April Fools' joke, and therefore issues affecting it get closed as "Invalid" in the issue tracker.<ref>{{bug|MC-176985|||Invalid}}</ref> Some notable major issues including:
<!-- Please do NOT remove some major points, especially related to crashes, as issues are not supported in the issue tracker and do matter more than any versions that are not April Fool's joke. -->

* Certain randomly generated biomes found in some dimensions can cause the game to crash due to the fatal calculation errors involving the world generation via exceptions in Java, including:
** "Bound must be positive" ({{code|java.lang.IllegalArgumentException}}). These do not apply to the easter egg dimensions, as randomly generated biomes do not generate anywhere.
*** Notable dimensions that generate such crashing biomes with that error include {{code|america}}, {{code|missingo}}; lesser-known dimensions including {{code|daybreak}}, {{code|many}}, {{code|predict}}, {{code|queue}}, and {{code|Salmon}}.
** "Exception generating new chunk" in server tick loop (<code>java.util.concurrent.CompletionException</code>). For example, one or more of the randomly generated biomes in <code>}J<*c</code> (<code>_generated:1423540522</code>) crashes the game in that dimension.
*** In [[debug mode]], the easter egg dimensions that also cause the "Exception generating new chunk" crashing error are "bridges", "content", "isolation", "library", "llama", "missing", "perfection", and "terminal". This is because the structures cannot be legitimately generated in the debug mode.
** The same crashes can also occur when generating the [[buffet]] world type using such crashing biomes.

== Trivia ==
* Because this snapshot has the same [[protocol version]] as [[20w13b]], crossplay between the two versions ''is'' possible but may cause unexpected issues.
* The uniquely generated dimensions do not begin until ID 3 due to the fact that 0 is [[the Nether]], 1 is the [[Overworld]], and 2 is [[the End]].
** The extreme numeric IDs can be accessed by warping with the codes such as <code>acyvoz</code> for the ID 3 and <code>aehUD7</code> for the ID 2147483647.
* Throwing a [[written book]] that is obtained with [[commands]] (without the correct [[Player.dat format#Written Books|data tag]] where the text "*Invalid book tag*" is shown when opened) lead to the uniquely generated dimension with the ID <code>_generated:1852123009</code>.
* In the JAR's <code>assets</code> folder, there is a new folder named <code>nothingtoseeheremovealong</code> that contains the sound for the [[Mojang]] splash screen (titled <code>bananana.ogg</code>) as well as a higher-pitched version (titled <code>banananana.ogg</code>).
* When playing <code>awesome_intro</code> with {{cmd|playsound}}, the namespace is also <code>nothingtoseeheremovealong</code>.
* The new loading screen startup sound (<code>bananana.ogg</code> or <code>banananana.ogg</code>) is considered an in-game sound effect (<code>nothingtoseeheremovealong:awesome_intro</code>) and can be played in generated dimensions like <code>code</code>.
* The [[#last page dimension|air.ogg]] stream’s web address features the Runic letter “[[wikipedia:Berkanan|birch]]” (ᛒ), similar in value and appearance to Latin B, the first letter in [[boq]]’s nickname. The Runic letter is rendered in [[wikipedia:Punycode|Punycode]] as <code>xn--jxe</code>.
* The advancement "Almost There" is effectively impossible to obtain without the use of commands due to its absurdly high requirement of one billion dimension changes. Doing so would require ''at least'' 142 real-life years of gameplay in Survival or 15 years in Creative, accounting for the 4 second portal activation time (skipped in Creative) and the 0.5 second portal cooldown, but not accounting for loading screens, which would extend this duration even further.
