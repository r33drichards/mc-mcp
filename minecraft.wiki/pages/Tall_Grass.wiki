'''Tall grass''' is the 2-block tall variant of [[short grass]].

== Obtaining ==
As an item, tall grass can only be obtained as chest loot.

=== Breaking ===
When [[Breaking|broken]] normally, tall grass has a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 [[wheat seeds]] item. This is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1–3, 1–5, or 1–7 wheat seeds with Fortune I, II, and III respectively.

When broken using [[shears]], tall grass drops two units of [[short grass]] instead.

Placing any block on tall grass breaks the grass and causes it to not drop anything.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Tall Grass|Shears=1|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Tall grass generates in [[plains]], [[savanna]]s, [[cherry grove]]s, [[meadow]]s, [[pale garden]]s, and [[lush caves]]. There is approximately 8.6 tall grass per chunk.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|tall-grass}}

=== Post-generation ===
[[Bone meal]] can be used on [[short grass]] to turn it into tall grass. {{IN|java}}, using bone meal on a [[grass block]] or a [[moss block]] also has a chance of generating tall grass.

== Usage ==
Most 2-block tall plants, including tall grass, have a disproportionately large hitbox compared to other plants.<ref>{{bug|MC-33580||The hitbox of double-tall plants is inconsistently big|WAI}}</ref> The only exception to this rule is [[tall seagrass]].<ref>{{bug|MC-163896||Double tall seagrass's hitbox is inconsistent with that of other double tall plants|WAI}}</ref>

=== Composting ===
Placing tall grass into a [[composter]] has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
