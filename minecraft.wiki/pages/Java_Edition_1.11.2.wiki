== Trivia ==
* 1.11.2 was the last version that required Java 6.
* 1.11.2 was released on the latest calendar date out of all release versions in the full ''Java Edition'' release, on December 21.
* At the time, 1.11.2 held the record of serving as the latest release of ''Java Edition'' for the longest time, with 168 days between its release on December 21, 2016 and the release of [[Java Edition 1.12|1.12]] on June 7, 2017.
** This was later broken by the timespan between the releases of [[Java Edition 1.12.2|1.12.2]] and [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]] (303 days).
*This is the last version of Minecraft without any development versions until [[Java Edition 1.16.1|1.16.1]].
