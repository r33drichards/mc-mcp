'''Prismarine''' is a type of stone that appears underwater in [[ocean ruins]] and [[ocean monument]]s. It periodically changes color between blue and green.<br>

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Prismarine drops itself only when mined with a pickaxe. If mined by any other [[tool]], it [[drops]] nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Prismarine, in large amounts, naturally generates as the main blocks making up [[ocean monument]]s. 

Normal prismarine can also be found in [[ocean ruins]].

== Usage ==
[[File:Prismarine.gif|125px|thumb|right|The color change of prismarine]]
Prismarine can be used for decoration or as a building block with high blast resistance.

The normal prismarine is uniquely useful for decoration as it has an animated texture. The cracks in prismarine slowly cycle in color through light blue, green, purple, and dark blue. The full animation for the prismarine texture changes color 22 times in an irregular sequence before the whole pattern repeats; this takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

=== Conduit power ===
{{main|Conduit}}
Prismarine can be used to activate a conduit by building a structure around it. By doing this, the [[conduit]] emits the "[[Conduit Power]]" effect in a certain radius, depending on how many blocks are used to power it. [[Sea lantern]]s, [[Prismarine Bricks|prismarine bricks]] and [[Dark Prismarine|dark prismarine]] can also be used for this purpose.

=== Note Blocks ===

== Trivia ==
{{quote|I picked Prismarine because 1) it sounds good, 2) it references water with "marine", 3) it references its "shimmering effect" I hinted at with "prism", and 4) it doesn't really mean anything in the real world.|[[Jeb]] about the name<ref name="Jeb on Reddit">{{reddit|26op99/twitter_jeb_with_the_help_of_reddit_and|cht13ys}}</ref>||Jeb_twitter.jpg}}
* The name "prismarine" was created by the now-deleted [[wikipedia:Reddit|Reddit]] user AjaxGb during a naming contest, where [[Jens Bergensten]] was looking for a name for the [[block]].<ref>{{reddit|26m30u/help_me_name_this_block|chsjfb6}}</ref>
