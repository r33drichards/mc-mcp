'''Iron ore''' is a [[mineral]] block typically found underground. It is a source of [[raw iron]], which can be smelted into [[iron ingot]]s. 

'''Deepslate iron ore''' is the [[deepslate]] variant of iron ore. It is found in deepslate layers.
== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Iron ore itself can be obtained by mining it with a [[stone pickaxe]] or higher enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. When mined without Silk Touch, iron ore drops a single [[raw iron]]. It is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1–2, 1–3, or 1–4 raw iron with Fortune I, II, and III, respectively.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}

Iron ore generates in three batches. The first batch attempts to generate 90 times per chunk in blobs of 0–13{{only|je|short=1}} or 0–16{{only|be|short=1}}, from levels 80 to 384, being most common around level 232 and becoming less common toward either end of the range. The second batch attempts to generate 10 times per chunk in blobs of 0–13{{only|je|short=1}} or 0–16{{only|be|short=1}}, from levels −24 to 56, being most common around level 16 and becoming less common toward either end of the range. The third batch attempts to generate 10 times per chunk in blobs of 0–5, evenly from levels −64 to 72.

Iron ore can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. Iron ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate iron ore.

Iron ore can generate as a large [[ore vein]] found in the deepslate layer, consisting of iron ore, [[blocks of raw iron]], and [[tuff]].
