'''24w20a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21]], released on May 15, 2024,<ref name=":0">{{snap|24w20a|May 15, 2024}}</ref> which fixes bugs. 

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
''' [[Witch]] '''
* Now always drops 4–8 [[redstone dust]] on death.
** This is to improve the viability of farms that utilize [[witch hut]]s to obtain redstone dust.<ref name=":0"/>

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[Effect]]s '''
* Improved player attribute and effect handling.
** Custom set base attributes are now kept when respawning.
** Active effects and modifiers are kept when changing dimension or winning the game.

''' [[Enchantment]]s '''
* [[Wind Burst]]
** Invalidates the fall damage protection of mace smash attacks once again, reverting the fix of {{bug|MC-270687}}.<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-270687?focusedId=1324659&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-1324659 MC-270687] — Maces enchanted with wind burst don't reliably protect players from fall damage — resolved as "Works As Intended".</ref>

=== Sounds ===
''' [[Piston]]s '''
* Changed sounds to lower their volume and attenuation.
** This was done to address the old sounds being too harsh and loud when used in redstone contraptions.<ref name=":0"/>

=== General ===
''' [[Credits]] '''
* Have been updated.

''' [[Data pack]] '''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>44</code>.

''' [[Custom structure]] '''
* <code>dimension_padding</code> jigsaw structure tag was changed.
** Now it is an object with fields:
*** <code>bottom</code>: the vertical padding at the bottom of the dimension, non-negative integer.
*** <code>top</code>: the vertical padding at the top of the dimension, non-negative integer.
** Can be written as a single non-negative integer instead to be applied to both top and bottom fields.
*** e.g. both <code>dimension_padding: 10</code> or <code>dimension_padding: { bottom: 10, top: 5 }</code> are valid.
* Data-driven enchantment field <code>weight</code> now has an upper bound of 1024.
* Data-driven enchantment field <code>max_level</code> now has an upper bound of 255.
* New entity sub predicate <code>movement_affected_by</code> - optional location predicate.
** When present, adds requirements on a block at most 0.5 blocks below the entity which can affect its movement.
