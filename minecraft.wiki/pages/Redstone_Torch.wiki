A '''redstone torch''' is a non-solid [[block]] that produces a full-strength [[redstone]] signal on all sides adjacent to it, except for its attached block, and can power the block directly above it. It deactivates while the block it is attached to is powered.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|java}}, the inactive redstone torch cannot be obtained as an item without commands. {{IN|bedrock}}, it can be obtained via inventory editing.<ref>In Java it is a block state and in Bedrock it is a entirely separate block.</ref>

=== Breaking ===
A redstone torch can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] using any [[tool]], or without a tool, and drops itself as an item.
{{breaking row|Redstone Torch|horizontal=1}}
A redstone torch is removed and drops as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space
* a [[piston]] pushes it or moves a block into its space

=== Natural generation ===
A single redstone torch is found inside each [[igloo]]. In [[ancient cities]], multiple redstone torches can be found integrated into circuitry.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|B2= Redstone Dust
|B3= Stick
|Output= Redstone Torch
|type= Redstone
}}

== Usage ==

=== Light ===
Redstone torches give off a [[light]] level of 7.

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the top part of restone torches emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#c32c1f}}. This causes the bottom part of the torch to render a small square shadow, and the surrounding texture to render diagonal lines of shadow in all directions.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Redstone torches can be used to craft [[activator rail]]s, [[redstone comparator]]s, and [[redstone repeater]]s.
{{crafting usage}}

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

Redstone torches can be used to power blocks and [[transmission component]]s such as [[redstone dust]], activate [[mechanism component]]s such as [[piston]]s, or invert redstone signals like a [[Logic circuit#NOT Gate|NOT Gate]]. 

;Placement
{{see also|Opacity/Placement}}

[[File:Redstone torch as power source.png|thumb|Examples of redstone torch placement and behavior]]

:The placement conditions of a redstone torch are identical to the ones of a normal torch, it can be attached to (some exceptions might apply):
:* the '''top''' or '''sides''' of any [[conductive]] block (examples: stone, soul sand, slime blocks, dispensers, etc.)
:* the '''top''' of a non-conductive block that is at least 16 pixels tall and has a 2x2 pixels surface under where the redstone torch would be positioned (examples: glass panes, vertical chains, fences, etc.)
:* the '''full side surfaces''' of a non-conductive block (examples: glass, stairs, open trapdoors, etc.)

: Redstone torches cannot be attached to the bottoms of any blocks.

: Attempting to attach a redstone torch to an invalid surface can cause it to "snap" to a valid surface adjacent to the same space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a redstone torch to the ''side'' of the fence causes the redstone torch to be attached to the ''top'' of the ground next to the fence instead.

;Activation

: A redstone torch is active unless the block it is attached to is powered. However, the type of power required to deactivate it differs between editions:

: {{IN|je}}: A redstone torch deactivates if the block it is attached to is either weakly or strongly powered.
: {{IN|be}}: A redstone torch deactivates only if the block it is attached to is strongly powered. An exception is a redstone torch placed on a (sticky) piston, which will turn off when the piston is extended and turn on when the piston is retracted: this mechanic is known by the community as "[[soft inversion]]".<ref>{{bug|MCPE-17909|MCPE-17909 — resolved as "Won't fix"}}</ref> 
: Effectively, a redstone torch [[Logic circuit#NOT Gate|inverts]] the signal applied to its attachment block: power level 0 is changed to 15 and power levels 1 to 15 are changed to 0 (for an alternative that produces a greater range of output power levels, consider a [[redstone comparator]] in subtraction mode).

: Walls, fences, glass, slabs, hoppers,<ref group=note>Redstone torches can be placed on hoppers only {{in|BE}}</ref> and stairs are non-[[conductive]], so redstone torches attached to them cannot be deactivated.

: A redstone torch takes 2 game ticks (0.1 seconds barring lag) to change state. {{IN|JE}}, redstone torches do not respond to all 2 game tick pulses.

;Behavior

:A lit redstone torch strongly powers the block above itself and weakly powers its other direct neighbor blocks, excluding the one it is attached to. It also produces the same [[particles]] as redstone dust.

: A redstone torch experiences "burn-out" when it is forced to turn off (by powering and de-powering the block it is attached to) more than eight times in 60 game ticks (3 seconds). After burning out, a redstone torch produces a "smoke" [[particle]]{{only|java}} and a hiss similar to an extinguished fire, deactivates, and then ignores attempts to change its state until the number of state changes in the last 60 game ticks drops to fewer than eight.

:{{IN|JE}}, a redstone torch might or might not attempt to turn itself back on after 160 ticks (8 seconds) depending on the update chain that caused it to burn out.<ref>{{bug|MC-120938}}</ref> The torch will be unresponsive to [[block updates#Neighbor changed update|neighbor updates]] during this time frame.
:{{IN|BE}}, each redstone torch can only burn itself out; the redstone torch needs to be in a circuit that causes it to power itself with no delay, otherwise it will not burn out. 
:A burnt-out redstone torch will turn back on after receiving a [[block update]]. There is no limit on how often a single redstone torch can burn out.
