The '''mod''' is an exclusive [[item]] in ''[[China Edition]]''.

== Obtaining ==
This item cannot be obtained using the {{cmd|give}} command; it can only be obtained by modifying the [[NBT]] data.

== Usage ==
=== In older versions ===
In the early [[versions]] of ''[[China Edition]]'', where custom items were not yet available, addons were created by modifying the "mod" data values to define items, which crudely enabled custom items through a brute-force approach.

The item used the old [[apple]] texture, could not be eaten, and did not  have a translated name (instead being displayed as "<samp>item.mod.name</samp>").
