'''MARILLA''' or '''M.A.R.I.L.L.A''', backronym for '''Minecraft Antiquated Robot Inadequate Loves Lying Audaciously''', is a character in the official [https://youtube.com/Minecraft ''Minecraft'' YouTube channel] voiced by Rill Askey, formerly known as [https://marillawex.com/2019/06/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-minecraft Marilla Wex].

She hosted the series [[Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft]] and then co-hosted [[The Secrets of Minecraft]], [[Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes]], and [[How We Make Minecraft]] with [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]].

== Appearance ==
MARILLA is an old box computer with a creamy tan colored base, dark brown casing, a green and white screen, a gray keyboard and a "Team Player Mode" switch on the back. A ROM cartridge with {{MC}} on it can be seen sticking out and a joystick sits on the right side connected by a cable. She is able to run programs such as ''Minecraft'' on herself.

== Personality ==
MARILLA is lighthearted, sarcastic, confidant, and audacious. She is quick to give false trivia and can be a little superstitious but always does so with positive boldness. She likes [[endermen]], but doesn't like [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]], in spite of constantly working with him on various projects.

== Powers and abilities ==
Being a computer, MARILLA is able to compute large amounts of information, possessing full access to the internet and several applications. These include some that augment abilities not typically possible by computers, such as a program for crying.<ref>{{YouTube link|z8fF4yb0aGc|Update Aquatic: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|Minecraft|June 28, 2019}}</ref> In spite of having a backlit screen, it does not constitute as [[light]] in ''Minecraft'', due to her soul possessing great darkness.<ref>{{YouTube link|Rn0KNAi1BsY|Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes: Episode 1|Minecraft|November 13, 2022}}</ref>

== Biography ==
{{Expand section}}
Supposedly, in the distant past MARILLA was a human, who came into contact with a witch, potentially [[Baba Yaga]]. She was offered three magic beans, but ended up being tricked, her soul being trapped inside of a computer inside [[Mojang Studios]].<ref name="witch">{{ytl|2zrD0ijjbUk|Passive & Neutral Mobs: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft @ 0:11|Minecraft|August 30, 2019|t=11s}}</ref> At one point, she claimed to have been discovered in [[the End]].<ref>{{YouTube link|JhgN2FVENSE|DESERT OF DOOM: Episode 2|Minecraft|December 9, 2022}}</ref> She would end up being used for many projects prior to the company's official founding, apparently as far back as the 1980s, before being deemed obsolete and left to rot inside of a broom closet.

Desperate for a purpose, she would begin to make [[Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|videos]] from inside, reciting various pieces of trivia from her own twisted perspective. She resided within the broom closet until she was hired by [[Jomang Studios]] in [[How We Make Minecraft|How We Make Minecraft - Series Two]].

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Hè-... hè-hè-h-h-h-Hello again! My name is [OLD MODEM SOUND]|M.A.R.I.L.L.A glitching awake at the beginning of every episode.}}

== Trivia ==
* The introductory sentences has minor differences depending on the video, some being in the greetings: "Hello!", "Hello there!", or "Hello again!" along with the glitching. The modem sound is also occasionally "[MODEM SOUND VARIATION 3582]" instead of the usual "[OLD MODEM SOUND]".<ref>{{ytl|YUM7XiEX1DI|Items: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|Minecraft|November 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|OS5LMnCg5_g|The End: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|Minecraft|February 7, 2020}}</ref>

* MARILLA implied at one point that a witch offered her three magic beans in exchange for her body being trapped in a computer for all eternity.<ref name="witch" />
* The description card on ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s YouTube channel has her as "Artificial Untelligence",<sup>{{Sic}}</sup> "Sentient computer/worryingly immortal", "Excellent liar", etc. This changes each episode.

* Her name is likely based on her actress Marilla Wex, as seen by the acronym having random words that spell out "MARILLA".
* The glitchy introductions feature MARILLA displaying a mockup of the boot loader 'Kickstart' from the {{Wikipedia|Commodore International|Commodore}} {{Wikipedia|Amiga}} line of computers.
* MARILLA is apparently worth less than a {{w|non-fungible token}}.{{Citation needed}}
