[[File:Active End Portal.png|thumb|200px|An activated End portal]]

An '''End portal''' is a naturally occurring [[generated structure]] that is used to travel into [[the End]]. It can only be found in the portal room of a [[stronghold]].

== Creation ==
In [[Survival]] mode, the player must venture to a stronghold to activate a pre-existing End portal, as [[End portal frame]] blocks cannot be obtained naturally. The portal is activated when an [[eye of ender]] has been placed in each of the End portal frame blocks, generating 9 [[End portal block]]s within the structure. Eyes of ender cannot be removed from End portal frames.

In [[Creative]] mode, the player can construct an End portal by placing 12 End portal frames in a ring enclosing an open 3×3 square and placing an eye of ender in each one. In order to activate, the End portal frames must be oriented correctly; the front face of each portal block must be pointed inward toward the 3×3 portal area. This can be achieved by the player standing in the center of the portal area and rotating to place the frames in a ring around them.

The End portal blocks do not depend on the End portal frame to exist; thus, one may create standalone portals with commands or by breaking the frames.<ref>{{bug|MC-1174|resolution=WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|Java}}, it is possible to construct an End portal which generates its [[End portal block]]s outside of its structure. Due to the fact that the End portal generation has the same mechanism as [[iron golem]] and [[snow golem]], the game allows the [[End portal frame]] arrangement to be rotated. 

Thus, {{in|java}}, a valid End portal should obey these three rules:

# Any three [[End portal frame]]s within one edge must have the same facing.
# Opposite edges must have opposite facing.
# All four facing must appear.

With a valid End portal, one can refer the corner between the edges facing west and north as its "structual origin". After 12 [[End portal frame]]s have all been filled with [[eye of ender]], if any [[End portal frame]] within the 5x5x5 cube at the north-west-down of the origin, which is not necessarily a part of the sturcture, is filled with an [[eye of ender]], the End portal is activated, generating 9 [[End portal block]]s at the northwest of the origin (not always within the sturcture).
[[File:Abnormal end portals in Java Edition.png|thumb|Abnormal End portals {{in|JE}}]]
Since rotation along X and Z axis is allowed, one can even construct a standing End portal frame.

There are 24 possible End portal frame configurations {{in|java}} in total. 8 of them are flat, 8 of them are standing in XY-plane, 8 of them are standing in ZY-plane.

== Generation ==
End portals are found within the portal room of a [[stronghold]], hanging horizontally over a pool of [[lava]], with a staircase leading up to the portal. A [[monster spawner]] spawning [[silverfish]] sits in the staircase. Each individual End portal frame block has a 10% chance of containing an eye of ender, as determined by the world seed. This means there is a one in 1 trillion chance for all 12 End portal frames to contain an eye of Ender, activating the portal upon initial generation. The frame has the highest probability of generating with a single eye of ender (37.7%), with probabilities dropping to 28.2% for zero, 23.0% for two, 8.52% for three, 2.13% for four, and a total of 0.433% for five or more. Because of the huge number of possible seeds, over 8 million seeds {{in|java}} that generate portals with 12 eyes of ender are known.<ref>https://github.com/hube12/SSGOutput/releases/tag/1.1</ref>

== Behavior ==
{{Main|End Portal (block)}}

Stepping into an activated End portal immediately opens up a loading screen and transports the player to the End — this leaves no time to back out, similar to entering a [[Nether portal]] in Creative mode. Upon entering the End, a 5×5 horizontal [[obsidian platform|platform of obsidian]] is generated centered at block [[coordinates]] (100, 48, 0), and the player is placed on top of it (100, 49, 0, facing west).

Mobs (except for the [[wither]]{{only|java}}, the [[creaking]] connected with a [[creaking heart]] and the [[ender dragon]]) can enter the portal similarly to the player.

{{IN|be}}, entities with [[passenger]]s can't be teleported.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-47288}}</ref>

The End portal blocks emit a [[light level]] of 15, the brightest light level in-game. Only one End portal block is needed to teleport to the End. End portal blocks can be placed anywhere with use of the {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}} commands, and they function as if they were a complete portal.

Activating the End portal destroys any blocks located in the center 3×3 square, including [[bedrock]] or another End portal frame. It destroys [[fluid]]s, although if the source block is not also removed, then it immediately flows back through. If an End portal is generated on a [[monster spawner]], the fire particles remain. The destruction of the blocks does not make any sound, and blocks do not drop as items. Events sometimes triggered by block destruction fail to occur; [[TNT]] simply disappears without detonating, and [[infested block]]s fail to spawn [[silverfish]]. However, containers (except for [[shulker box]] and [[ender chest]]) still drop their contents.

The sound for the opening of the portal is a global sound event, meaning it can be heard by all players in all dimensions. This can be disabled {{in|java}} by setting the {{cmd|/gamerule globalSoundEvents}} to <code>false</code>.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Dropping a [[Falling Block|gravity-affected block]] into the portal it causes the obsidian platform to regenerate, and the gravity-affected block is placed on the platform; however, it is destroyed when another gravity-affected block or the player goes through the portal, because doing so regenerates the obsidian platform again.
* End portals do not naturally generate in the Nether, and a player cannot build them without enabling cheats or using Creative mode. If the player does, the portal functions normally, teleporting the player to the End.
* If an End portal is built in the End, it functions like the [[exit portal]], teleporting the player back to their spawn point in the Overworld (or the Nether if a [[respawn anchor]] is used.)
