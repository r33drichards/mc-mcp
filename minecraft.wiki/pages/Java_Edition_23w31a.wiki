'''23w31a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.2]], released on August 2, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w31a|August 2, 2023}}</ref> which adds the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experimental toggle, adds {{cmd|random}} command and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|random}}'''
* A new command for randomizing values and controlling random sequences.
** Syntaxes:
*** {{cmd|link=none|random (value{{!}}roll) <range> [<sequence>]}}: draw a random value.
*** {{cmd|link=none|random reset (*{{!}}<sequence>) [<seed>] [<includeWorldSeed>] [<includeSequenceId>]}}: control random sequences.
** Arguments:
*** <code>range</code>: A range of values to randomize between, inclusively. For instance, <code>1..6</code> is a regular D6 roll.
*** <code>sequence</code>: The name of a random sequence to sample or reset.
**** In {{cmd|link=none|random reset}}, <code>*</code> refers to all random sequences.
*** <code>seed</code>: A seed to use for the random sequence after reset.
*** <code>includeWorldSeed</code>: A boolean specifying whether to include the world seed when seeding the sequence. Defaults to <code>true</code>.
**** When <code>false</code>, it means the sequence evaluates to the same regardless of which world the command is run in.
*** <code>includeSequenceId</code>: A boolean specifying whether to include the sequence ID when seeding the sequence. Defaults to <code>true</code>.
**** When <code>false</code>, it means all sequences evaluate to the same regardless of which name they have.
** {{cmd|link=none|random (value{{!}}roll)}} notes:
*** When using <code>roll</code> rather than <code>value</code>, the resulting value is also shown in chat for all players.
*** When <code>sequence</code> not specified, this command can be executed by players without operator privileges.
** {{cmd|link=none|random reset}} notes:
*** By default, all sequences are seeded as {{cd|d=,|0|true|true}}.
*** Using <code>*</code> instead of a sequence ID resets all sequences and sets the default parameters.
*** If no seed is specified, the sequence resets to the default parameters.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Added the <code>generic.max_absorption</code> attribute.
** Acts similar to <code>generic.max_health</code>, but instead of being the upper bound for <code>Health</code>, it is the upper bound for <code>AbsorptionAmount</code>.
** The mob effect <code>absorption</code> increases <code>generic.max_absorption</code> as well as fills the <code>AbsorptionAmount</code> to the max when applied.

'''[[Experiments]]'''
* Added the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experimental toggle (<code>trade_rebalance</code> data pack).

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the following block tags:
** <code>#camel_sand_step_sound_blocks</code>: contains <code>#sand</code> and <code>#concrete_powder</code>.
** <code>#concrete_powder</code>: contains all types of [[concrete powder]].
* Added the following damage type tag:
** <code>#no_knockback</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|explosion|player_explosion|bad_respawn_point}}.
*** Causes knockback to not be caused by the damage itself. Used in vanilla for damage that is caused by events, such as explosions, which apply knockback separately.
* Added the following entity tag:
** <code>#non_controlling_rider</code>: contains <code>slime</code> and <code>magma_cube</code>.
*** Represents entities that don't override their vehicles movement control.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Barrier]]'''
* No longer produces fall particles when entities fall on it.
* No longer creates particles when a player brushes it.
* Can now be waterlogged by players in Creative mode.
** Water cannot be placed in them or taken out by non-direct interactions such as [[dispenser]]s.

'''[[Chorus flower]]'''
* No longer provides support for hanging or standing blocks.

'''[[Decorated pot]]s'''
* Now have Creative inventory tooltips.

'''[[Enchanting table]]'''
* Reverted the texture of lapis lazuli slot to the texture before [[Java Edition 1.18-pre5|1.18-pre5]], to make the consistency with smithing table.

'''[[Pink petals]]'''
* The size of the hitbox now increases with the number of petals.

'''[[Sculk sensor]] and [[calibrated sculk sensor]]'''
* Can now detect the following events:
** <code>entity_action</code> (new), with frequency 4:
*** [[Camel]]s dashing.
*** Camels standing up.
*** Camels sitting down.
*** [[Turtle]]s clearing away [[sand]].
*** [[Witch]]es drinking a potion.
** <code>entity_damage</code>, with frequency 7:
*** [[Totems of undying]] activating.

'''[[Smithing table]]'''
* Now in the custom recipes, the upgrade material can be sent to the GUI instantly with the {{key|Shift}} + left click shortcut.

=== Items ===
'''[[Music disc]]s'''
* The [[Pigstep]] music disc is now the last one of the music discs in the Creative inventory.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Camel]]s, [[frog]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[sniffer]]s'''
* Now panic when damaged while attached to [[lead]]s.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* The discount for curing a villager is no longer multiplied if the villager is reinfected and cured again.
* Now attempt to spawn an [[iron golem]] every 30 seconds instead of 35. 

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]] entities'''
* Now start updating their client-side position and rotation on the first tick after an update.
** In previous versions, updates were applied in the same tick, causing uneven motion.
** New behavior is now similar to armor stands, mobs and players.
* On the server, position and rotation are still updated immediately.
* Duration of this interpolation is controlled by the field <code>teleport_duration</code>.
** 0 means that updates are applied immediately.
** 1 means that the display entity moves from current position to the updated one over one tick.
** Higher values spread the movement over multiple ticks.
** Please note that this value is clamped to avoid glitches due to periodic position updates.
** The new value applies only to position and rotation changes made after it changed.
*** That means any current movement continues unchanged.
* Note: behavior while riding remains unchanged from previous versions.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* [[Diamond ore]] is now generated more frequently in the [[deepslate]] layers of the Overworld.
** Added a new ore blob placement: Uniform distributed, from height -64 to -4, with blob size 8, generation frequency 2 and a 50% chance of discarding when exposed to air.
** Other existing diamond ore placements remain untouched.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Function (Java Edition)|Function]]s'''
* A single backslash <code>\</code> as the last non-whitespace character of a line now allows a command to be continued on the next line.
** Leading and trailing whitespace of the following line are stripped before appending.
* Functions can now contain macro lines, making them Function Macros.
** Any line beginning with <code>$</code> (as the first non-space character) marks a macro line.
** A macro line also contains one or more substitutions in the form of <code>$(variable)</code>.
*** Commands with variable substitutions are re-evaulated after substitution.
**** Running commands with this type have extra cost compared to pre-parsed functions.
**** Game attempts to cache the result of certain parameter set being used in a call, to reduce costs when repeatedly calling.
** When calling a function macro a compound with data for all argument variables must be provided.

'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* Added <code>(if|unless) function</code> subcommand.
** A new execute sub-command that runs a function or function tag and matches the return value(s). If a tag is given, all functions run regardless of the results of prior functions.
** Syntax: {{cmd|link=none|execute (if{{!}}unless) function <function> -> [''execute'']}}
** Arguments:
*** <code>function</code>: The function or tag to run.
** The matching of the result value of the function(s) that run:
*** At least one of the functions must succeeed for the match to succeed.
*** A successful call is defined as a function that:
**** Uses the <code>return</code> command to return a value.
**** The return value is not 0.

'''{{cmd|function}}'''
* Extended command usage, now supported parameters for function macro's variable substitution.
** New syntax: {{cmd|link=none|function <name> [<arguments>{{!}}with (block <sourcePos>{{!}}entity <sou<nowiki/>rce>{{!}}storage <sou<nowiki/>rce>) [<path>]]}}
** New arguments:
*** <code>arguments</code>: A data compound, enclosed in <code>{}</code>.
*** Data source: A data source specification, like what could already be used for {{cmd|data get}}.
*** <code>path</code>: An NBT path specification.
** The data source and <code>path</code> must specify a compound data entry.
** The compound must contain one entry for each variable used in the macro.
** More data may be present in the compound and if so is ignored.
** Calling a non-macro function with a data compound is silently ignored.
** When a macro is called, the values provided are substituted in place of the variable specifications and the resulting commands are executed.
*** In order to improve performance when repeatedly calling with the same parameter, values in the provided compound which are referenced in macro as parameters are cached.
** Any syntax errors in the lines resulting from variable substitution result in the entire function call being skipped.

'''{{cmd|item}}'''
* Can now replace items in [[jukebox]]es.
* Can now remove items in [[chiseled bookshelves]].

'''{{cmd|return}}'''
* Added <code>run</code> subcommand: {{cmd|link=none|return run <command>}}.
** This takes the <code>result</code> value from running the specified <code>command</code> and returns that as the return value of the function. In all other aspects, it works like return with a specified <code>return</code> value. If the given command fails, the return value is 0.

'''General'''
* History of used commands is now saved and accessible across worlds.
** The last 50 commands that are sent in chat are remembered across game sessions.
** The command and chat history can be accessed by pressing {{key|UP}} or {{key|DOWN}} in the chat.
** Regular chat is only persisted within the same game session (leaving a server or world clears them).
** Recent commands are stored in <samp>[[command_history.txt]]</samp> in the [[.minecraft]] folder.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The "Smithing with Style" advancement now grants 150 experience upon completion.

'''[[Recipe book]]s'''
* Bamboo fence and bamboo fence gate are now grouped with the other ones.

=== General ===
'''[[Chunk tick]]'''
* <code>randomTickSpeed</code> [[game rule]] now affects the rate of accumulation of [[snow]] and [[ice]] the same way it affects crops and other blocks.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>16</code>.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Values in the <code>SH</code> row now show up as question marks when playing on a server, instead of wrong values.
* When hitboxes are displayed through {{key|F3+B}}, entities that have a passenger display the passenger's attachment point.

'''Game events'''
* Added <code>entity_action</code> game event, to replace <code>entity_roar</code> and <code>entity_shake</code>.

'''"Multiplayer" and "World Selection" screens'''
* Renamed "Cancel" button to "Back".

'''Pack metadata'''
* New features have been added to data packs and resource packs to allow creation of packs that are compatible with multiple versions of the game.
** Pack metadata now includes an optional field <code>supported_formats</code> which describes a range for pack formats that this pack supports.
*** Examples: <code>16</code>, <code>[16,17]</code>, <code>{"min_inclusive": 16, "max_inclusive": 17}</code>.
** <code>pack_format</code> field is still required and its format remains unchanged, to allow older game versions to read pack data.
*** If <code>supported_formats</code> is present, it must contain the value declared in <code>pack_format</code>.
*** Since this new information is ignored by older versions of the game, they will always see a "normal", single-version pack, without any extended compatibility.
* Packs can now contain overlay directories ("overlays").
** Overlays are sub-packs applied over the "normal" contents of a pack.
*** These directories have the same layout as the top-level pack, including the <code>assets</code> and <code>data</code> directories.
*** Overlays can be applied if they support the client's pack format.
*** Overlays can add and replace files, but not remove them.
**** For example, if the overlay <code>foo</code> is applied, the file <code>foo/assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png</code> replaces contents of <code>assets/minecraft/textures/bar.png</code>.
*** <code>pack.mcmeta</code> and <code>pack.png</code> are ignored in overlay directories.
** New section called <code>overlays</code> have been added to pack metadata.
*** It contains an <code>entries</code> field, containing a list of overlays.
*** Every overlay entry has two fields:
**** <code>formats</code> - range of supported formats.
**** <code>directory</code> - overlay directory (allowed characters: {{cd|d=and|a-z|0-9|_|-}}).
** Order of application: overlays are stacked from the bottom to top of the list.
*** For example, if a pack has two overlays: <code>"entries": [{"directory":"A", ...}, {"directory":"B", ...}]</code>, the game first looks in B, then A and then in the top pack directory.

'''Protocol'''
* Optimized the way chunks are sent to clients to allow players with low-bandwidth internet connections to play on multiplayer servers.
** Chunks are no longer sent over the network to the client in one big continuous batch.
** They are instead sent in smaller batches depending on the available bandwidth. This means that:
*** Clients with extremely low-bandwidth connections don't time out while loading the world.
*** Clients with low-bandwidth connections can interact with the world while some chunks are still loading.
** Only chunks within the client's render distance are now sent.
* Changed network protocol to allow for more data-driven content in the future.
** Configuration phase automatically starts after login phase (i.e. after client account has been verified) and lasts until the player joins the world (play phase).
** Clients can stay in configuration phase indefinitely - it's up to server to release it to the world.
** Servers can also request clients to re-enter the configuration phase after it has entered the play phase.
*** Other players see such clients as disconnected.
** Users in configuration phase aren't visible on the player list.
** Actions allowed in configuration phase (moved from play phase).
*** Configuration of data-driven registries.
*** Configuration of enabled features.
** Actions shared between configuration and play phases:
*** Application of server resource packs.
*** Update of tags.
*** Exchange of custom packets.
*** Ping and keep-alive packets.
** The server now negotiates resource pack in the configuration phase.
*** This means that the player no longer is in world when answering prompts and reloading resources.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>16</code>.
** The process of upgrading a pack can be assisted by using an automated Slicer tool.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/slicer/releases/tag/v1.1</ref>
** All textures containing multiple sprites in a sheet for GUI have been split into individual sprites under <code>textures/gui/sprites</code> (automated by Slicer tool).
** All textures in the <code>realms</code> namespace have been moved into the <code>minecraft</code> namespace (automated by Slicer tool).
** <code>villager2.png</code> has been renamed to <code>villager.png</code> (automated by Slicer tool).
** <code>icon/trial_available</code> and <code>realm_status/expires_soon</code> GUI sprites are animated with <code>.mcmeta</code> declarations instead of individual sprites (automated by Slicer tool).
** The bundle tooltip background is now drawn as a nine-sliced sprite.
** The icons for the Accessibility, Language, Realms News buttons have been split from their underlying button texture.
** The Realms Invite button is now drawn as an overlay on the normal button texture.
*** The highlighted texture state for this button has been removed.
** The highlighted states for Realms invitation number icons have been removed.
** The exclamation marks on the <code>notification\more.png</code> have been removed.

'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* The <code>belowName</code> display slot selector is now <code>below_name</code>.

'''[[server.properties]]'''
* Added new <code>log-ips</code> option (defaults to <code>true</code>).
** When set to <code>false</code>, prevents player IPs from being included in the log when players join the game.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Moved all types of concrete powder to newly added block tag <code>#concrete_powder</code> from <code>#mineable/shovel</code> block tag, then added <code>#concrete_powder</code> to <code>#mineable/shovel</code>.
* Removed <code>entity_roar</code> and <code>entity_shake</code> from <code>#vibrations</code> and <code>#warden_can_listen</code> game event tags, then added <code>entity_action</code> to them.

'''[[Telemetry]]'''
* Added a button to the telemetry data collection screen that links to the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

'''General'''
* Added validation for symbolic links in data packs and resource packs, to improve safety.
** This feature expands on symbolic link validation in worlds added in the previous release.
** The game now warn users if a pack added via drag and drop contains disallowed symbolic links.
** Packs containing disallowed symbolic links aren't visible in UI and commands.
** Additionally, directories and files that are not recognized as packs no longer are copied via drag and drop.

== Experimental ==
These changes only take effect when the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Changes ===
==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Trading]]'''
* Changed the trading mechanism of librarians selling enchanted books.
** Instead of offering every possible enchanted book, librarians are now offering specific enchanted books depending on which biome they come from.
*** Jungle and swamp villages do not generate naturally. Thus, players must breed villagers or cure zombie villagers in these biomes to access their trades.
** All tradable enchanted books now split to special books and normal books.
*** Special books have a specific enchantment with a fixed level, and are only available from master librarians with full XP.
*** Normal books have a specific enchantment without a fixed level, just like before.
** All enchantments used for [[crossbow]], [[fishing rod]], and [[trident]] are removed from trading.

*** Buying trade (new) × 2
*** Special selling trade × 2
*** Ordinary selling trade × 5
