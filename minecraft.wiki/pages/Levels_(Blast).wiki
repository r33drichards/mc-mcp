'''Levels''' are the main gameplay features within ''[[Minecraft Blast]]'' and is placed within the [[Home (Blast)|home screen]]. Within each level, random assortments of differently colored [[Blocks (Blast)|blocks]] constantly drop into empty spaces. Some levels have less colors of blocks than others. The player can tap on a group of two or more of the same-colored blocks to break them. Levels have three different difficulties that rewards players with more or less rewards based on the difficulty. If a player fails to beat the level with the given number of moves, an "Out Of Moves" pop-up will appear asking if the players want to spend 900 emeralds to get five more moves. 

Levels are played with the help of a blast table, the [[Companion (Blast)|companion]] will first place down the blast table after running out of energy from doing the [[Tasks (Blast)#Build|"Build"]] task (2nd task in Chapter 1). The camera will then pan into the blast table and bring the player to level one, and the blast table will open its glowing top part.

[[Blockers (Blast)|Blockers]] are the main goal found within levels. Blockers are required to be destroyed or collected in order to beat a level, failing to do so within the number of moves will end the level. 

If a level is beaten within the first try, a pop-up will appear explaining the [[On Fire! (Blast)|"On Fire"]] mechanic which rewards players by giving them free boosters which are placed randomly in the level once another level is played. If a level is not beaten within the first try or if the player quits, the "On Fire" mechanic resets. The "On Fire" mechanic can have three tiers which gives different boosters.

== List of difficulties and rewards ==
Additional emeralds can be earned by leftover boosters after completing all goals in a level, as well as additional boosters earned by leftover moves such as fireworks and TNT, awarding 2 emeralds per booster.
