A '''honey bottle''' is a consumable [[drink]] item obtainable by using a [[glass bottle]] on a full [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]]. Honey bottles remove [[Poison]] when drunk and can be used to craft [[honey block]]s and [[sugar]].

=== Harvesting ===
A honey bottle can be obtained by {{Control|using}} a [[glass bottle]] on either a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]] with a honey level of 5. Doing this angers any [[bee]]s inside, causing them to attack the player, unless there is a [[campfire]] or another block on fire within 5 blocks below the nest or hive. Using normal fire would likely cause the nest, bees, and flowers around it to burn.

A [[dispenser]] with glass bottles can be used to collect the honey without angering the bees. The honey bottle appears as an item in the dispenser's inventory. If the dispenser is full, the honey bottle is shot out.

== Usage ==
To drink a honey bottle, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking one restores {{hunger|6}} [[hunger]] and 1.2 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]] and returns a [[glass bottle]]. Consuming the item also has the benefit of removing any [[Poison]] effect applied to the player. Unlike drinking [[milk]], other applied effects are not removed upon drinking a honey bottle.

Honey bottles can be drunk even with a full hunger bar. Drinking a honey bottle takes 25% longer than eating other food - 2 seconds - and has a unique sound.
