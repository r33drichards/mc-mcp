'''Minecraft Live: Announcement Trailer''' is the announcement trailer for [[Minecraft Live 2020]].

== Summary ==
A [[baby zombie]] is elevated up to a circle of [[chickens]], behind them the phrase ''Minecraft Live''. The zombie begins chasing a chicken, passing a ring of floating {{MCE|glow squid}}s, a group of {{MCD|enchanter}}s (one of which smacking the child with a book) enchanting several unseen mobs, several {{MCD|iceologer}}s dropping ice, and then finally the date for the event; October 3rd. An [[enderman]] screams as the chicken and baby zombie run through an abstract labyrinth, before encircling a {{MCD|redstone monstrosity}} on [[minecarts]]. The chicken rushes behind a locked gate, but the baby zombie has a {{MCD|key golem}}, and then they fall into {{MCE|mud}}, briefly getting some flower petals to become a giant {{MCE|muddy pig}}'s flower. Continuing with giant mobs, the next area they race through is a black void with oversized flowers and a ginormous [[moobloom]] and normal sized [[bees]]. From there they run past what appear to be balloons of a [[panda]], the {{MCD|Arch-Illager}}, a {{MCE|horned sheep}}, and a [[ghast]], as [[fireworks]] explode around them. The video concludes with all the relevant information for the event established, but the zombie never reaching the chicken, a haunting cluck ending the final shot.
