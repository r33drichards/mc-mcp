The '''iron door''' is a variant of the [[door]] made of iron that can only be opened using [[redstone]]. Iron doors are more secure than [[Wooden Door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s because they cannot be opened by hand and cannot be broken by [[zombie]]s. They are also more resistant to explosions, and immune to fire and lava.

== Obtaining ==
Iron doors are most commonly found in [[stronghold]]s, where they generate often. They are also craftable by the player using 6 [[iron ingot]]s.

=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break iron door is [[pickaxe]].

Iron door drops itself when it's destroyed.

Iron door also drops itself when its supporting block is moved or removed.
=== Natural generation ===
Iron doors generate as part of:

* Prison rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s
* [[Stronghold]]s with a stone [[button]] to open{{only|JE}}

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting

|B1 = Iron Ingot
|A2 = Iron Ingot
|B2 = Iron Ingot
|A3 = Iron Ingot
|B3 = Iron Ingot
|Output = Iron Door, 3
|type= Redstone
}}

== Usage ==
{{main|Door#Usage}}
Iron doors can only be opened with redstone power; players or [[wind charge]] blasts cannot toggle iron doors.

==== Barrier ====
Iron doors can only be opened and closed by a [[redstone]] signal. When an iron door opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space between.

==== Redstone component ====
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}
An iron door is a redstone [[mechanism component|mechanism]] and can be activated by [[Redstone mechanics#Power | weakly powering]] any cardinally adjacent block.

When activated, the iron door immediately opens. When deactivated, it immediately closes.

==== Air pockets ====
Iron doors can be used as air pockets underwater {{in|Java}} because they can't be waterlogged. They can also be used as air pockets in [[lava]] in both [[Java Edition|Java]] and [[Bedrock Edition]]s since they don't burn in lava.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Iron door is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
