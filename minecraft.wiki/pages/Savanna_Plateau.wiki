A '''savanna plateau'''{{fn|Also known as '''savannah plateau''' in [[Language#Differences between English variants|other English variants]].}} is a variant of the [[savanna]] biome that replaces it at higher elevations. The biome features [[spotted wolves]]  unlike the regular savanna, and lacks villages and pillager outposts.

== Description ==
A savanna plateau is found when a savanna generates on top of a plateau or beneath a stony mountain. Due to its low erosion value, the [[deep dark]] can generate underneath this biome.

Savanna plateaus are identical to the regular savanna, sharing its grassy landscape covered with [[acacia tree]]s, small [[oak tree]]s and both [[short grass]] and [[tall grass]], as well as its arid climate, which prevents proper [[rainfall]] from happening within the biome. [[Leaves]] and grass take on a dry olive-green color. A distinguishing feature of this biome compared to regular savannas is the absence of [[village]]s and [[pillager outpost]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-238689}}</ref>

Altogether, the biome features a greater variety of animals compared to its counterpart: farm animals spawn like normal, with [[chicken]]s, [[pig]]s and [[cow]]s generating their warm variants, and [[horse]]s, [[sheep]], [[donkey]]s and [[armadillo]]s still spawn on the plateaus. A key difference, however, include the presence of [[Wolf|spotted wolves]], which spawn in savanna plateaus only. [[Llama]]s spawn in both the regular savanna and the savanna plateau biomes {{in|be}}, while {{in|je}}, llamas spawn in the  savanna plateau only.<ref>{{bug|MC-159092||Llamas do not spawn in regular savanna biome|WAI}}</ref>

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], savanna plateaus use warmish atmospherics, lighting, and color grading similar to [[jungles]], although they use default volumetric [[fog]].
