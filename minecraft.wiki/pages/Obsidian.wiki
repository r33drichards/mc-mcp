'''Obsidian''' is a [[block]] found naturally in all [[dimension]]s, and created when [[water]] flows over a [[lava|lava source]]. It has high [[hardness]] and [[blast resistance]], making it immune to normal [[explosion]]s. Obsidian can be used to craft [[beacon]]s, [[enchanting table]]s, and [[ender chest]]s, and build the frame of a [[Nether portal]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break obsidian is the [[pickaxe]]. Obsidian needs to be broken using a [[diamond pickaxe]] or better, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Obsidian|Pickaxe|Diamond|Netherite}}
Obsidian drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Ender chest ===
8 obsidian blocks are dropped by an [[ender chest]] when broken without a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]].

=== Post-generation ===
[[File:Obsidian Spring.png|200px|thumb|Using a water spring to mine obsidian.]]
Obsidian is formed when flowing [[water]] touches a [[lava]] source block, and it can be found naturally where water from a [[spring]] or [[aquifer]] has flowed over a nearby [[lava pool]]. This provides a renewable way of obtaining obsidian, as lava can be farmed via [[cauldrons]] under [[pointed dripstone]].

Obsidian is created when a Nether portal is generated in [[the Nether]] or the [[Overworld]]. This portal can then be mined, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. {{IN|Java}}, if a Nether portal is generated midair, 4 extra obsidian is generated at the bottom of the portal.

When an [[entity]] enters the End via an [[End Portal (block)|End portal]], it always spawns on a [[obsidian platform|platform]] consisting of 25 obsidian. This platform can then be mined, and regenerates whenever an entity enters the End, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. Obsidian pillars also regenerate when the [[ender dragon]] respawns.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Natural Obsidian.png|thumb|300px|Naturally occurring obsidian.]]
[[File:Obsidian Creation.png|thumb|200px|Water pouring onto lava springs, forming obsidian.]]
Obsidian generates naturally in all [[dimension]]s:
* [[Overworld]]:
** Obsidian generates as part of [[ruined portal]]s.
** A single obsidian block generates in some types of [[ocean ruin]] buildings.
** Obsidian generates in [[woodland mansion]]s with a [[diamond block]] concealed by it. These are found in the secret "obsidian room" and "lava room", on the 2nd or 3rd floors.
* [[The Nether]]: 
** Obsidian generates as part of ruined portals.
* [[The End]]:
** Solid [[End spike]]s can be found on the End's main island, generating all the way down to Y=0.
** 26 blocks of obsidian generate as a part of the [[End ship]] in an [[End city]].

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|obsidian}}

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s may [[barter]] a block of obsidian when given a [[gold ingot]] with a chance of ~8.53% ({{frac|40|469}}).

== Usage ==
Obsidian is useful for building [[explosion]]-resistant structures as it has a blast resistance of 1,200, the highest of all blocks obtainable in [[Survival]] mode (tied with [[crying obsidian]], [[anvil]]s, and [[netherite block]]s). Obsidian also cannot be destroyed by the [[ender dragon]]. These qualities make obsidian an extremely effective defensive [[block]], and it is commonly used in many bases in multiplayer servers as protection from griefers.

Obsidian is, however, not immune to the [[wither]]. Although [[Wither#Wither Skull|black wither skulls]] have merely the explosive power of a [[ghast]] fireball, blue wither skulls ignore blast resistance, which means they can destroy obsidian. The wither's body can also destroy obsidian, either through block-breaking behavior upon taking damage, or its dash attack{{only|bedrock}}. The wither is the only mob in the game that can break obsidian. 

Obsidian is one of the two blocks an [[End crystal]] can be placed on; the other is [[bedrock]].

=== Nether portals ===
Obsidian is used to create a [[Nether portal]] frame, which is then ignited using [[fire]]. The frame must be a vertical rectangle any size from 4×5 to 23×23. The corners of the frame are not required for an operational portal.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Note Blocks ===
Obsidian can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Obsidian cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. It also cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

== Issues ==

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Obsidian is one of the hardest blocks to destroy in ''Minecraft''. In reality, [[Wikipedia:Obsidian|obsidian]] has characteristics similar to [[glass]], being a brittle material.
* Geologically, obsidian is a volcanic glass that forms when lava is flash-cooled. It is the only igneous rock that's glassy. 
** Other volcanic rocks in the game are [[andesite]], [[basalt]], and [[tuff]].
* 71.25 times the explosive power of TNT would be required to destroy a block of obsidian; however, additional TNT increases the blast radius, not explosive power. It is possible to {{cmd|summon}} an explosion strong enough to destroy obsidian.
* While working on the [[Texture Update]], [[Jasper Boerstra]] expressed great difficulty over redesigning obsidian.<ref>{{Tweet|JasperBoerstra|1017064729200775168|Obsidian is tough to design in Minecraft because: This is obsidian. Very specular, brittle, see-through on thin edges, very dark, very smooth. texture is largely defined by specular and shape. In MC, it's a purple colored 'rock' with a few spots!}}</ref>
