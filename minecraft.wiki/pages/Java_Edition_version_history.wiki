[[File:Version History - Java.png|thumb|All versions of ''Minecraft:'' {{JE}} as of early January 2026.]]

{{JE}} has been in constant development since May 10, 2009, when it was simply named ''Minecraft''. What is now known as [[pre-Classic]] refers to the early unreleased versions of ''Minecraft'' during the week from May 10 to May 16, 2009. The next phase, what was later called [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]], lasted from May 17 to November 10, 2009. [[Indev]], short for "in development", lasted from December 23, 2009, to February 23, 2010. [[Infdev]], short for "infinite development", lasted from February 27 to June 30, 2010. [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] lasted from June 30 to December 3, 2010, and [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] lasted from December 20, 2010, all the way through to November 11, 2011. The official release of ''Minecraft'' (''Java Edition'') came on November 18, 2011, at [[MINECON 2011]], and further updates have been released ever since, the most recent being {{version|java}}. Starting with [[1.12.2]], the game officially adopted the ''Java Edition'' subtitle, to distinguish it from the {{BE}}.

{{anchor|Full Release}}

The full release stage of [[Java Edition|''Minecraft: Java Edition'']]'s development started on November 18, 2011, and has continued until the present day. At this point of development, the game was considered "complete", having both an "[[The End|ending]]" and being ready for ratings and reviews. The game's price also increased from what it was in [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]], but users who previously bought the game were not charged extra.

The [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] development phase started on December 20, 2010 and ended on November 18, 2011. The main goals of this development stage were a larger focus on polishing gameplay, additional content, and stability.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/2175441966/minecraft-beta-december-20-2010</ref> The game's price also increased from what it was in Alpha, but users who previously bought the game were not charged extra.

The [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] development phase started on June 29, 2010, and ended on December 20, 2010. This version also limited the gamemode to Survival, but saw a re-release of multiplayer. At this time, [[Notch]] began developing the game full time, causing much more frequent updates. These were also the first versions which had to be purchased, though the price increased in later stages.

The [[Java Edition Infdev|Infdev]] development phase started on February 27, 2010 and ended on June 30, 2010. During this stage, ''Minecraft'' was only available in single-player [[Survival]] mode and versions were unnumbered under the name '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]'''. At this point, [[Notch]] rewrote the game code to allow mostly "infinite" terrain.
