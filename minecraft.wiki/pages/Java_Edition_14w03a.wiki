'''14w03a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on January 16, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122052947/https://mojang.com/2014/01/minecraft-snapshot-14w03a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w03b|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> which adds the {{cmd|clone}} and {{cmd|fill}} [[command]]s as well as {{cmd|gamerule logAdminCommands}}.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|clone}}'''
* Clones all the blocks (not entities) from a given area to a different given area.
* Up to 4096 blocks can be copied.
*** The clone can be masked or replace - replace copies every block, masked only copies non-air blocks.
** Usage: {{cmd|clone <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x> <y> <z> [mode]}}.
** Example: {{cmd|clone 1001 3 1002 1011 3 992 1001 5 992 masked}}.

'''{{cmd|fill}}'''
* Fills a given volume with a specified block.
* Up to 4096 blocks can be filled.
** <code>oldBlockHandling</code> works like with {{cmd|setblock}}, but with additional options: hollow to only fill the outer layer of blocks and fill the inner part with air, outline to fill the outer layer of blocks and ignore the inner part.
* Works similarly to /setblock
** Usage: {{cmd|fill <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <TileName> [dataValue] [oldBlockHandling] <dataTag>}}.
** Example: {{cmd|fill 1001 3 1002 1011 5 992 wool 6 replace}}.

'''[[Gamerule]]s'''
* <code>logAdminCommands</code>
** If set to false, prevents all command blocks from outputting to the client console. 
** If used on a server, it also does not log player executed commands in the server's log. 
* Players still see other players' executed commands in chat.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Player head]]s'''
* No longer only have one layer.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Iron golem]]s'''
* Now only drop iron ingots when killed by the player, either through combat or potions, or player-activated mechanisms such as manually lit TNT.
* If killed without player intervention, only drops poppies.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* When struck by lightning, now transform into [[witch]]es, similar to [[pig]]s transforming to [[zombie pigmen]] and [[creeper]]s to [[charged creeper]]s.

'''[[Zombie pigmen]]'''
* Now only drop gold nuggets and rare drops when killed by the player, either through combat or potions, or player-activated mechanisms such as manually lit TNT.
* If killed without player intervention, only drops rotten flesh.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Desert pyramid]]s'''
* Now spawn with [[stained clay]] [[File:Desert pyramid JE2 BE2.png|40px]] rather than [[wool]] [[File:Desert pyramid JE1 BE1.png|40px]].

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Now spawn with cobblestone under the [[gravel]] pathways.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|tp}}'''
* Now supports rotation arguments.
** Example: {{cmd|tp @p ~ ~ ~ ~20 ~40}} teleports the player so that they face 20 degrees to the right and 40 degrees downwards.

'''[[Target selectors]]'''
* Now supports cubic areas.
** Example: <code>@e[x=0,y=0,z=0,dx=10,dy=10,dz=10]</code> gets all entities between 0,0,0 and 10,10,10.
* The radius value in selectors is now based on the block center.
** A radius of 0 works for exact block positions.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Item tooltips'''
* Now shows the internal name for use in commands ({{key|F3+H}} mode).

=== General ===
'''Block IDs'''
* NBT data in commands can now use block/item names in place of numerical IDs.
* Old IDs still work, but are being phased out slowly.
* Other occurrences of blocks/items now need to be named IDs.
* Regular IDs in commands no longer work. {{cmd|give [player] 1}} is now {{cmd|give [player] stone}}.

'''F3 hotkeys'''
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|D}}: Clear chat history (including previously typed commands).

'''[[Skin]] customization'''
* Uses a char.png file with new layout and new dimensions.
** Dimensions for the file are now 64&times;64.
* Right and left arms and legs are now editable independently.
* The hat layer is now full-body, can be transparent.
** Overlays for arms, legs, head, and body are called sleeves, pants legs, hat, and jacket respectively.
* Backward-compatible with older skins.
** Old skins still work, but do not have the new features.
** New skins when used in pre-14w02a versions act like old skins.
* New "Skin Customization" button in the options menu.
** Cape visibility is now toggled from here.
** Players can toggle the visibility of overlays, independent for each limb/body part.
