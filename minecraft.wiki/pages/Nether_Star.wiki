A '''Nether star''' is an [[item]] that is [[drop]]ped by the [[wither]] upon death. It is used to craft a [[beacon]], and cannot be destroyed with explosions.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
The [[wither]] always drops one Nether star upon death, unaffected by [[Looting]].

{{Drop sources|Nether Star}}

== Usage ==
Nether stars have the same animated glint as [[enchant]]ed items and [[end crystal]]s.

Dropped Nether stars never despawn {{in|Bedrock}}. {{IN|java}}, Nether stars dropped by a dying wither despawn after 10 minutes; if dropped by any other means they despawn after 5 minutes like any other item. Nether stars are immune to all explosions, but can still be destroyed by [[cacti]], [[fire]], [[lava]], and the [[void]].
