'''Hoglin jockeys''' are the rare appearance of a baby [[piglin]] riding a baby [[hoglin]].

== Spawning ==
=== Post-generation ===
Baby piglins run near and ride baby hoglins. If there are more baby piglins than baby hoglins, the baby piglins occasionally jump on other baby piglins already riding a baby hoglin, with a maximum of 3 stacked on a single baby hoglin.

=== Dismounting ===
The baby piglins can dismount the hoglin after getting on it, making hoglin jockeys a temporary occurrence.

== Drops ==
When killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]], hoglins (including babies) drop {{xp|5}}{{only|JE|short=1}}/{{xp|1|3}}{{only|BE|short=1}}, and baby piglins drop {{xp|1}}.

Baby piglins will not drop any items they have picked up, regardless of jockey status.

== Behavior ==
=== Baby piglins ===
{{main|Piglin}}
Baby piglins are passive and play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin.

Baby piglins never grow up.
