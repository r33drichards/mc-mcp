[[Beast Boy]], [[Black Steve]], [[Steve (mob)|Steve]], and [[Rana]] were human mobs originally used as tests during the Indev phase. They were made by [[Dock]], one of ''Minecraft''{{'}}s past artists. After Dock left the Minecraft development team, these MD3 mobs were cut from the game. These mobs had no animation and glided around in the same pose. Notch also tested some other MD3 models that weren't going "into the final game."<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87ZyyYKbdlY&list=PLYvbqe7pJsoP9Z2AisjV8jcRPZzV93j7i&index=23&t=1s</ref>

{{main|Mob (entity)}}

Mob were passive mobs who took the form of clones of [[Steve]], the only default skin at the time. In [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]], humans could be spawned by pressing {{key|G}} and would run around aimlessly. From [[Java Edition Classic 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST|Classic 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST]] and onward, there was another mob called "Monster" that looked like a human but would attack the player. This "Monster" was the result of trying to spawn the base class for hostile mobs as an actual mob, a similar situation would later occur for humans too. Notch also used the name "monster" for the green humanoids in his unfinished game: [[Legend of the Chambered]]. The entity IDs <code>Mob</code>, for mobs, and <code>Monster</code>, for "Monster", existed until [[Java Edition 1.11|1.11]], in which entity IDs were converted to [[resource location]]s.
