'''Invalid data value stone bricks''' refers to item forms of [[stone bricks]] with damage values outside of the usual range which stone bricks can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value stone bricks items are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Transmutation ===
[[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation|Several methods of block transmutation]] can be used to obtain invalid data value stone bricks in block form. These blocks can be mined from Beta 1.8 Pre-release{{verify}} to 14w21b{{verify}} to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.

For arrow transmutation, the initial block being transmuted must be a regular stone bricks block, i.e. a stone bricks block with metadata value 0. Cracked, mossy, or chiseled stone bricks cannot be transmuted.

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release|[[File:Stone Bricks (inventory) JE1.png|32px]] Stone bricks have been added. Invalid data variants exist as a consequence of how block and item metadata is handled.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=RC2|[[File:Stone Bricks (inventory) JE2.png|32px]] All 3D items are now shaded more reasonably.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w22a|[[File:Stone Bricks (inventory) JE3.png|32px]] Most 3D items in the inventory have been rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4.2|dev=12w34a|[[File:Stone Bricks (inventory) JE4.png|32px]] Items appeared slightly darker in the player's inventory than in chests prior to this version.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w10a|[[File:Stone Bricks (texture) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] Invalid stone bricks item forms are now 2D.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w25a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE1.png|32px}} With the introduction of data-driven item models, any item with a data value outside of what is accepted by the game has no model to point to, resulting in use of the [[Missing textures and models|missing item model]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w30a|Invalid data value stone bricks, alongside other invalid data value items, now appear the size of a full block when held in third person or by another player or mob.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w31a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE2.png|32px}} The missing model's inventory appearance has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value stone bricks also changing.
|The items also appear the size of a full block when held in first person and when dropped on the ground, and also appear larger than before in an [[item frame]].}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w43a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE3.png|32px}} The missing texture has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value stone bricks also changing.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=17w47a|Numeric IDs for blocks and items have been completely removed from the game, with different variants of stone bricks being given their own string IDs. As a result, invalid data value stone bricks have been "removed" as any such item now converts cleanly into regular stone bricks.}}

Invalid data value stone bricks ''are'' an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.<!--
