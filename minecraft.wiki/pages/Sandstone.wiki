'''Sandstone''' is a solid [[block]] related to [[sand]] that comes in two color variants, the other being [[red sandstone]]. Regular sandstone is commonly found in [[desert]]s and [[beach]]es. Sandstone also has three decorative variants: [[chiseled sandstone]], [[cut sandstone]], and [[smooth sandstone]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Sandstone can be mined with any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Regular sandstone generates in [[desert]]s and [[beach]]es compressed underneath several blocks of [[sand]]. It generates at noise cave entrances in desert and beach biomes.

Many [[structures]] that generate in deserts are made of sandstone. [[Desert well]]s are made of normal sandstone, and desert [[village]]s, [[desert pyramid]]s, and warm [[ocean ruins]] are made greatly of sandstone. All the aforementioned structures use sandstone [[block]]s, [[slab]]s, [[stairs]], and [[wall]]s.
