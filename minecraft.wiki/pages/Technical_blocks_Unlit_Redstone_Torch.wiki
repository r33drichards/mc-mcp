''Item names did not exist prior to Beta 1.0.''
* Beta 1.0 - 13w36b: <samp>Redstone Torch</samp>
* (As block name, ''item does not exist'') 13w37a - 17w47a: <samp>Redstone Torch</samp>
* The block unlit redstone torch (not its item form, even block itself) has been removed in 17w47a and redstone torch has become generic. Now unlit redstone torch "item" can be obtained without modification, with NBT tag called "BlockStateTag". This command is used in order to obtain unlit redstone torch item: /give @p redstone_torch{BlockStateTag:{lit:"false"}}
