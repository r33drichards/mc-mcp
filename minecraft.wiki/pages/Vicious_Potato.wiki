=== Natural generation ===
Vicious potatoes generate rarely in the [[hash]] biome, in Potato dimension. They usually generate in clusters of 1-10, with each vicious potato sitting atop a small pillar made of [[gravtater]] blocks, known as a "venomous column".

== Usage ==
Vicious potatoes shoot projectiles (known as <code>vine_projectile</code> in the code) that damage other entities. They shoot when they receive a [[random tick]] or a redstone signal, and there is an entity in a 31×31×31 cuboid centered on the vicious potato block. Projectiles deal {{hp|5}} damage and fly in a straight line, unaffected by gravity. Although the projectiles cannot pass through solid blocks, a vicious potato still shoots projectiles regardless of any barriers between it and the targeted entity.

A vicious potato attacks all living entities. Mobs don't try to run away from them, and do not consider the vicious potato as an enemy, because it isn't an entity. Even mobs with block-breaking abilities, like [[wither]]s, don't try to destroy vicious potatoes that attack them.
