{{About|unused features in [[Legacy Console Edition]]|removed features|Legacy Console Edition removed features}}{{Exclusive|console|plural=1}}

Since the beginning of ''[[Minecraft]]''<nowiki/>'s development, numerous features were added that are inaccessible and have no actual use. [[Legacy Console Edition]] contains a wide variety of such features, namely remnants from other editions, leftover debug material utilized during development and other scrapped elements.

== Blocks ==
=== Command blocks ===
{{main|Command Block}}
All three variants of the command block are obtainable through external inventory editors, as opposed to ''[[Java Edition]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', where they're accessible through [[cheats]]. They are completely stripped from any in-game functionality, lacking a corresponding [[GUI]] and the ability to run [[commands]]. The game still calls on and applies the textures accordingly, which seems to imply command blocks were functional in development builds of the game and used by [[4J Studios]]. Several functions and remaining NBT data relating to opening and using command blocks and for running many different types of commands are also present in the game data.

The game's localization data contains a possibly related, unused chat message for players executing commands. The block's [[Legacy Console Edition descriptions|description]] states "Used to execute commands."<gallery mode="packed">

</gallery>

=== Barrier ===
[[File:Barrier (held) JE1 BE1.png|right|width=125x125]]
{{main|Barrier}}
Barriers are solid and invisible blocks, also acquired through external editors. They mostly behave like intended, aside from casting shadows like normal blocks, thus making them somewhat visible. Interestingly, 4J Studios themselves utilized barriers in the [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial|Update Aquatic tutorial world]]{{until|TU73|nocat=1}} and various [[Mini games|Mini game]] maps, notably the glide track [[Shrunk (Glide track)|Shrunk]].

Its description states "An invisible but solid block."

=== Wood ===
{{main|Wood}}
Blocks with the [[log]]'s bark texture on all six sides are referred to as wood. These have multiple variants, corresponding to each wood type and their stripped forms. They are broken with an [[axe]]. Unlike in modern editions of the game, they can't be crafted into [[planks]]. Nor is wood [[flammable]] despite its appearance, though it does catch [[fire]] from [[lava]]. [[Furnaces]] accept wood as [[fuel]]. 

All variants of wood were later added as obtainable blocks in both [[Creative]] and [[Survival]] in ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' [[PlayStation 4 Edition 1.90|1.90]], it being the only version of Legacy Console to receive the [[Village & Pillage]] update.

Its description states "Chopped using an axe, and can be crafted into planks or used as a fuel."

=== Petrified oak slab ===
[[File:Oak Slab JE1 BE1.png|right|width=125x125]]
{{main|Petrified Oak Slab}}
Before the addition of current [[Wooden Slab|wooden slabs]] and their variants in ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'' [[TU9]], old wooden slabs were merely another variant of [[Smooth Stone Slab|stone slabs]]. Thus, they weren't flammable and had to be broken with a pickaxe, in spite of optically being the same as standard oak slabs.

When the new wooden slabs were added, the old ones were removed from [[crafting]] and the [[Creative inventory]], making them inaccessible by those means. However, the original wooden slabs weren't converted upon updating a [[world]]. Therefore, they are still legitimately obtainable through old world saves.

Its description states "Used for making long staircases. Two slabs placed on top of each other will create a normal-sized  double slab block."

== Items ==

=== debug_fourj_item ===
{{main|debug_fourj_item}}
<samp>debug_fourj_item</samp> has the texture of a barrier, no display name nor description. As its ID suggests, it was utilized during development for debug purposes. When used on a [[mob]], it sets that mob to be [[persistent]]. The item texture ID <code>barrier</code> only applies to this item, as the actual barrier uses the block texture ID <code>barrier</code>.

=== Minecart with command block ===
[[File:Minecart with Command Block (item) JE1.png|right|width=125x125]]
{{main|Minecart with Command Block}}
Minecarts with command blocks only exist in their item form. Trying to place one down will summon a regular [[minecart]] instead. According to ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition'', its intended purpose was to execute commands upon interacting with [[activator rails]].

The game's localization data contains the unused description for this item, stating "Used to execute commands on the move!"

=== Spectral arrow ===
[[File:Spectral Arrow (item) JE1.png|right|width=125x125]]
{{main|Spectral Arrow}}
Since the Legacy Console never received the [[Combat Update]], spectral arrows ultimately went unused. They can be shot using a [[bow]] and even had their particle trail ported over. Due to the absence of a functional [[Glowing]] effect, the arrows have no effect on their target other than dealing regular [[damage]].

Its description states "Gives the victim a glowing outline that can be seen through blocks."

=== Shield ===
{{Main|Shield}}
Code for the shield is present in the game data, but needs to be assigned an item form manually to obtain it in-game. It has no model and texture, nor a display name and description. It functions like intended, absorbing most of the damage dealt to the player.

The shield was later added properly in [[PlayStation 4 Edition]] [[PlayStation 4 Edition 1.90|1.90]].

=== Tattered written book ===
The "Tattered" fourth generation for written books is not obtainable in standard gameplay. It can only be accessed by setting the {{Nbt|int|generation}} tag to 3.

=== Unused item data ===

== Entities ==
=== Killer Bunny ===
The killer bunny is a white [[rabbit]] with horizontal red eyes, being hostile towards [[player]]s. It can only be summoned by changing a rabbit's <code>RabbitType</code> tag to <code>99</code> and upon being modded into the game, it will be given the name "<code>entity.KillerBunny.name</code>". Its attack strength changes depending on the [[difficulty]]: it will deal {{Hp|5}} points on Easy, {{Hp|8}} points on Normal and {{Hp|12}} points on Hard mode. Although not a neutral entity, it will not despawn when switching to Peaceful mode. The killer bunny is retextured in most Texture and Mash-up packs despite not being offically used.

== Areas ==
=== Cavern testing area ===
<div style="text-align: center;"><gallery>
Battlemode Cavern Large testing area.png
</gallery></div>
In the Battlemode map Large Cavern there is an out-of-bounds area that cannot be accessed without using modifications, and seems to be a testing area used to test various aspects of the game in Battlemode. It consists of a [[chest]], a [[minecart with chest]], a [[furnace]] and [[crafting table]], an [[item frame]], an [[enchanting table]] and a [[dispenser]] along with a [[cauldron]]. There is also a [[sign]] with text that reads "11111". The chest is empty, however the furnace has a stack of [[gold ingots]] inside.

=== Cavern unseen structures ===
<div style="text-align: center;"><gallery>
Battlemode Cavern Large village.png
Battlemode Cavern Large structure.png
</gallery></div>
Also in the Large Cavern Battlemode map, there is an unseen [[village]] right beside the big opening of the cave and a obscure mossy [[Stone Bricks|stone brick]] structure which was likely going to be a part of the main battle arena.

=== Cove unseen caves ===
<div style="text-align: center;"><gallery>
Battlemode Cove Large unseen cave.png
Battlemode Cove Large unseen cave mountains.png
</gallery></div>
In the Large Cove map there is a lot of scenery that goes unused and unseen, the majority being caves. However, some can be seen without using mods, for example [[swimming]] out of the main arena through a one block gap at a waterfall.

== Sounds ==
=== Corrupted cave sounds ===
There are two unused corrupted [[Ambience#Cave ambience|cave sounds]], these being <code>cave1.binka</code> and <code>cave8.binka</code>. Oddly, the non-corrupted versions that are used are called <code>cave1_fixed.binka</code> and <code>cave8_fixed.binka</code>.

=== Sound loops ===
{{exclusive|Xbox 360|section=1}}
{{Incomplete section|What version of the game is [[:File:Waterfall.ogg]] or [[:File:LCE Waterfall Loop (Corrupted).mp3]] from?}}
The four audio loops from [[C418]]'s early Java Edition sound tests existed in the [[Xbox 360 Edition]] files until [[Xbox 360 Edition TU56|TU57]] when the game's audio format was changed to match that of the other editions. Despite other sound effects from alpha and beta versions of ''Java Edition'' existing still in the files to this day, these were removed.

== Resources ==
=== Blocks and items ===
==== Structure block textures ====
[[File:LCE unused structure block textures big.png|160x32px]]<br/>

In <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> there are seemingly unused textures which were going to be used for the [[structure block]]. These texture resources are actually called on and used by the game for the structure block which implies that [[structure block]]s were used in debug/development builds of the game. There are also several functions relating to opening and using structure blocks in the game data.

==== Structure void texture ====
{{InvSprite|Structure Void}}<br/>

Like the structure block textures, there is also a seemingly unused texture for the [[structure void]] in <samp>[[items.png]]</samp>. Structure voids are actually in the game and function identically to their ''[[Java Edition]]'' counterparts if loaded in a [[structure file]]. 

==== Shulker box break particle layer ====
In <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> there is an unused tile directly to the right of the [[shulker box]] tile. This was intended to be a non-tinted overlay when structure blocks are broken for texture packs, as seen in the Norse Mythology mash-up pack's <samp>terrain.png</samp> file, however the game does not attempt to call for it.

=== Particles ===
There are several unused ''[[Java Edition]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' particles in the particle sheet for Legacy Console Edition.

=== Other ===
==== Old tutorial screenshot ====
[[File:TU19 Tutorial screenshot.png|179x179px|class=pixel-image]]

In the Chinese Mythology Mash-Up's files, there is a low-quality version of the popup image from the tutorial mode in the [[Xbox 360 Edition TU19]] tutorial world.

==== Aquatic Update graphic ====
[[File:LCE Aquatic Update Graphic.png|left|frameless]]<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

This is a formerly used graphic featuring the artwork for the [[Update Aquatic|Aquatic Update]]. It was used to access the store page for ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' for ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' when discontinued. It's located in <code>MCBREUpSell720.fui</code>.{{note|MCBRE is short for ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition''.}}

==== Altimeter icons ====
<div style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; width: fit-content;" class="pixel-image">

<gallery mode="nolines" style="text-align: left;" heights="40">
AltimeterBG LCE1.png|Altimeter icon
AltimeterButton LCE1.png|Button to toggle altimeter
</gallery>

</div>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
There was once a toggle-able altimeter planned for the [[Glide (mini game)|glide]] [[mini game]], however this idea was scrapped. Leftover are these graphics.

====Team alliance icon====
[[File:Alliance LCE1.png|40x40px|left]]<br/><br/>

There was once a feature planned to allow alliances and teams in mini games, however this idea was scrapped. Leftover is this graphic along with some unused text regarding teams. 

==== ''Minecraft'' icons ====
[[File:LCE Minecraft Icon.png|left]]<br/><br/><br/>

Inside almost every <code>.fui</code>{{note|Used for storing user interface assets.}} file from the Legacy Console Edition there is a 64×64 Minecraft icon whose purpose is unknown. Such an icon is only sometimes seen as world icons. These icons are identical to the <code>MinecraftIcon.png</code> file and are also present in Mash-Up packs.

==== PS3 layout table ====
[[File:Unused PS3 layout template (Colors reversed).png|179x179px]]

Found on the [[PlayStation 3 Edition]] is this graphic located in <code>DebugUIMarketingGuide720.fui</code>, and which seems to be some sort of layout table.

== Status effects==
=== Glowing ===
{{main|Glowing}}
To obtain the Glowing effect, the player's NBT data has to be edited using an editor. In other editions of the game this effect is obtained when hit by a spectral arrow, however that is not the case here as [[Arrow#Spectral arrows|spectral arrows]] are non-functional in this edition, and so is the [[Effect|status effect]] itself.

=== Saturation ===
{{main|Saturation (effect)}}
Saturation is non-functional in this edition and will not regenerate a player's [[Hunger|hunger points]]. It can not last longer than a few ticks, even when the duration of the effect was made longer using a NBT editor.

=== Blindness ===
{{main|Blindness}}
This unused effect impairs the players vision by surrounding them with a thick black fog, with only a few blocks being visible. It also prevents the player from [[sprinting]] and doing critical hits to [[Mob|mobs]] or players.

=== Health Boost ===
{{main|Health Boost}}
A non-functional status effect, which was intended to be used to increase a player's maximum [[health]]. It uses the [[absorption]] effect icon texture instead of its own.

=== Bad Luck ===
{{main|Bad Luck}}
The direct opposite to the [[Luck]] status effect. It subtracts the effect level from the [[attribute]] <code>generic.luck</code>.{{More info needed|Does this effect even work?}}

== Other ==
=== Debug menu ===
In the Legacy Console Edition there is a debug menu that was most likely used by the developers during development. It can currently only be accessed in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU4|Xbox 360 Edition TU]]4 and below.<ref>[https://assemblergames.org/viewtopic.php?f=81&t=8595 "Debug unlocked"] - AssemblerGames, September 13, 2018</ref>

=== Old tutorial world ===
In the game files there is a leftover world file of the [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial#History|TU46 tutorial world]], and is located in <code>\Tutorial\Tutorial.mcs</code>.

=== DLC ===
There are a few DLCs which used to be purchasable but now can't be obtained without modding anymore, most of which are located in <code>\CU\DLC\</code>.{{verify|Which DLCs exactly?}}
