[[File:Minecraft-tnt-explosion.gif|frame|A [[TNT]] explosion.]]
An '''explosion''' is a physical event, generally destructive, that occurs in several different circumstances. It can destroy nearby [[block]]s, propel and damage nearby [[entities]], and cause [[fire]]s in some cases. Explosions produce a "shockwave" [[particle]] effect. Explosives include [[ghast]] fireballs, [[TNT]], [[End crystals]], and [[beds]] when not in the Overworld.

The propulsion effect of explosions is often used for [[Tutorial:TNT cannons|TNT cannons]].

== Interaction with entities ==
{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}

=== Velocity ===
Each affected entity is accelerated by between 0 and 1 blocks per game [[tick]] (0 to 20 blocks per second), added to its current velocity. This effect can accumulate over multiple explosions, even within a single tick.

The magnitude of the velocity given to each entity in the range of an explosion is calculated with the following code:
<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
magnitude = (1 - distance/(2*power)) * exposure * knockbackMultiplier * (1 - EXPLOSION_KNOCKBACK_RESISTANCE)
</syntaxhighlight>
Or in formula form, <math>\left(1-\frac{\text{distance}}{2\cdot\text{power}}\right)\cdot\text{exposure}\cdot\text{knockback multiplier}\cdot\left(1-\text{explosion knockback resistance}\right)</math>.

Distance is measured from the explosion center to the entity's feet position. A list of explosion powers can be found in the [[#Causes|Causes]] section. Exposure is discussed in the [[#Exposure|Exposure]] section. Explosion knockback resistance refers to the [[attribute]] <code>explosion_knockback_resistance</code>. The knockback multiplier depends on the cause:
{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Cause !! Knockback multiplier
|-
| Default || 1.0
|-
| Wind charge || 1.22 ({{wikipedia|Single-precision_floating-point_format|float}})
|}

To calculate the final velocity, the game takes the vector pointing from the explosion center to the entity's eye position and sets its length to the previously calculated magnitude. [[TNT]] entities are the only exception, where the direction goes to the tnt's feet instead of its eyes.

=== Damage ===
The following code is used to calculate the damage inflicted on an entity:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
impact = (1 - distance/(2*power)) * exposure;
damage = (float)((impact*impact + impact)/2 * 7*(2*power) + 1)
</syntaxhighlight>
In formula form, this is:

<math>\text{impact} = \left( 1- \frac{\text{distance}}{2 \cdot \text{power}} \right) \cdot \text{exposure}</math>

<math>\text{damage} = 7 \cdot \text{power} \cdot \left (\text {impact}^2 + \text{impact} \right) + 1</math>.

Players are damaged differently depending on [[difficulty]]. The main damage value is used to calculate the final damage in other difficulties:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Player damage per difficulty {{Main|Damage}}
|-
! Difficulty !! Damage calculation
|-
| [[Peaceful]] || No damage
|-
| [[Easy]] || <code>min(damage/2 + 1, damage)</code>
|-
| [[Normal]] || <code>damage</code>
|-
| [[Hard]] || <code>damage * 3/2</code>
|}

At the end of each game [[tick]] only the highest single explosion damage is chosen. Note that the main damage value has a +1 at the end, so all entities in range (within <math>2\cdot\text{power}</math>) of an explosion receive at least 1 damage even when the explosion is fully blocked. The only exceptions are invulnerable entities, [[Nether star]]s, and Peaceful players.

The [[Blast Protection]] enchantment and the [[Resistance]] effect are handled separately.

=== Calculator ===
{{:Calculators/Explosion entity influence}}


=== Exposure ===
[[File:SampePointsTNT.svg|300 px|thumb|The sample points for the exposure calculation of [[TNT]].]]

The '''exposure''' is a measurement of how much of the explosion is blocked by blocks. It ranges from 0 (when the explosion is entirely blocked) to 1 (when there are no obstructions).

To calculate the exposure, the game picks a set of sample points in the entity and casts rays from the explosion center to each point.

For each ray, the game checks if it intersects with any block hitbox. If it does, it is considered obstructed. The exposure is then calculated by dividing the number of unobstructed rays by the total number of rays.

==== Sample points ====
The sample points are arranged in a <math display="inline">\left\lceil2\cdot\mathsf{width}+1\right\rceil\times\left\lceil2\cdot\mathsf{height}+1\right\rceil\times\left\lceil2\cdot\mathsf{length}+1\right\rceil</math> 3D grid. <math display="inline">\mathsf{width}</math>, <math display="inline">\mathsf{height}</math>, and <math display="inline">\mathsf{length}</math> represent the X, Y, and Z dimension of the entity's [[#Hitbox|bounding box]] respectively (measured in blocks).

Points on the grid are spaced by

<math display="block">\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\text{width}}{2\cdot\text{width}+1} \\ \frac{\text{height}}{2\cdot\text{height}+1} \\ \frac{\text{length}}{2\cdot\text{length}+1} \end{bmatrix}</math>

With the negative corner at

<math display="block">\begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\lfloor2\cdot\text{width}+1\rfloor}{2\cdot\text{width}+1}\right) \\ 0 \\ \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\lfloor2\cdot\text{length}+1\rfloor}{2\cdot\text{length}+1}\right) \end{bmatrix}</math>
==== Edge cases ====
[[File:Explosion exposure raycasts interacting with fence gate.png|300px|thumb|An explosion affecting a creeper through a fence gate. The collision boxes debug renderer is enabled to show the fence gate hitbox. Rays are only obstructed (red) if they intersect the full cube containing the fence. Unobstructed (green) rays can go through the fence hitbox otherwise.]]
* Exposure is directionally biased (and the ray targets can sometimes be outside the entity) due to bug {{Bug|MC-232355}}. This mostly affects small entities and entities that are far from a multiple of 0.5 wide.
* The top of [[scaffolding]] only obstructs exposure rays if the feet position of the affected entity is above it. This has the effect of explosions appearing to travel down through scaffolding but not up.
* For blocks whose collision box extends outside the full cube containing them ([[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, the back of [[piston]] arms, [[moving block]]s, etc.), they only obstruct exposure rays if the rays intersect the full cube where the block is located.

== Block destruction ==
[[File:ExplosionComparison.png|right|thumb|Comparison of explosion craters, from a [[charged creeper]] (left), [[TNT]] (center) and regular [[creeper]] (right).]]
[[File:ExplosionRay.png|right|thumb|The rays from the explosion center to points that are uniformly distributed on the surface of a cube. (this defines only their directions)]]

On a small scale, explosions form a roughly spherical crater. The size of that crater is dependent on the '''power''' of the explosion and the '''blast resistance''' of the destroyed blocks.

=== Calculating which blocks to destroy ===
To calculate the blocks affected, "rays" are created from the explosion center to the outer points of a 16 by 16 by 16 grid. Each of those rays gets an '''intensity''' of <math display="inline">\text{power} \cdot (\text{random value from 0.7 to 1.3})</math>.

For each ray, with the '''position''' starting at the explosion center:

# The game checks the block at the current '''position''' (this ignores block shape).
# If the block isn't air, '''intensity''' is reduced by <math display="inline">(\text{blast resistance} + 0.3) \cdot 0.3</math>.
# If the remaining '''intensity''' is above 0 and the block can be blown up, it gets added to the list of blocks to blow up.
# '''Position''' is moved 0.3 blocks along the ray.
# '''Intensity''' is reduced by <code>0.22500001</code>.
# If the remaining '''intensity''' is above 0, repeat from step 1. Otherwise, continue with the next ray.

This typically results in the maximum sphere of block damage having a radius of approximately 4/3 times the explosion power. This can be experimentally verified by repeating an explosion of a set explosion power at some coordinate inside blocks and measuring the radius of the resulting sphere of air.

After the process is done, the list of blocks to blow up is shuffled. For explosions that can cause [[fire]]s, the game attempts to generate fire in {{frac|1|3}} of the blocks in the list. This fire is successfully placed only when above an opaque block.

Due to the fact that the game ignores block shapes when checking blast resistance, explosions happening inside a non-full block get dampened heavily. Sufficiently weak explosions happening on [[ender chest]]s, [[enchanting table]]s, or any height of [[water]] or [[lava]] do no block damage.

=== Dropping blocks ===
Blocks destroyed by explosions have a chance to drop items as if mined with an unenchanted diamond [[tool]]. Blocks destroyed by [[TNT]] have a 100% chance of dropping. Other explosions have a {{frac|1|power}} chance of dropping items. However, [[dragon egg]]s, [[beacon]]s, [[conduit]]s, [[head]]s, [[shulker box]]es and [[decorated pot]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-263554|||WAI}}</ref> always drop from explosions.

The drop chance of blocks in explosions can be customized via three [[game rule]]s: <code>blockExplosionDropDecay</code>{{only|java|short=1}} (includes [[End crystal]]s), <code>mobExplosionDropDecay</code>{{only|java|short=1}} and <code>tntExplosionDropDecay</code>. Only <code>tntExplosionDropDecay</code> is set to <code>false</code> by default. If an explosion's drop decay is set to <code>false</code>, items have a 100% chance of dropping.

Worlds created before 1.21 retain their old <code>tntExplosionDropDecay</code> settings. Upgraded worlds need to use {{cmd|gamerule tntExplosionDropDecay false}} to get the new behavior.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}<ref>https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-56036?focusedId=1331407&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-1331407</ref>

Despite doing [[damage]] to [[entities]], [[firework]]s do not destroy terrain and as such are not counted as conventional explosions.

[[Lab table]]s sometimes perform a non-terrain-damaging explosion when creating [[garbage]] item.{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}}

== Blast resistance ==
{{About|a property of the blocks|the enchantment|Blast Protection|section=1}}
The following table shows the blast resistance values used in ''Minecraft'''s code for all blocks. In [[add-on]] documentation for {{BE}}, these values are multiplied by 5 when used for the {{cd|explosion_resistance}} value in the {{cd|minecraft:destructible_by_explosion}} component. For example, [[cobblestone]] has a blast resistance of 6, so to make a custom block with the same blast resistance as cobblestone, quintuple that (which is 30) must be stored in its {{cd|explosion_resistance}} value.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Explosions with a power greater than 100 look mostly the same from the outside, as only certain lines are used to determine if a [[block]] breaks. However, some of those lines continue underground.
* Explosions that occur in flowing [[water]] or [[lava]] apply propulsion and damage to [[entities]], but don't affect any [[block]]s, regardless of the blocks' blast resistance.
* Underwater explosions don't emit smoke [[particle]]s.
* Explosions can redirect projectiles, including [[ender pearl]]s.
* An explosion just after a mob's death can propel the [[mob]]'s body.
* If a falling sand entity falls into primed TNT when in water, it deals block [[damage]].
