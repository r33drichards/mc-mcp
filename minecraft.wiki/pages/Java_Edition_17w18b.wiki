== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''Advancements'''
* The "Monster Hunter" and "Monsters Hunted" advancements now use 22 mobs instead of 23, removing the [[illusioner]] from the list.
* Moved the advancements added in [[17w18a]] (Best Friends Forever, The Parrots and the Bats, Two by Two) into the Husbandry tab.

'''[[Narrator]]'''
* Made the narrator work on nearly all systems (Linux requires [http://www.festvox.org/flite/ Flite] for it to work).
