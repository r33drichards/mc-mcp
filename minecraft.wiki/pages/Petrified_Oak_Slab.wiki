A '''petrified oak slab''', known generically as a '''wooden slab''' {{in|be}}, is a unique type of [[slab]] available through commands or by upgrading from legacy versions. Unlike all other slabs, they are unobtainable in vanilla [[Survival]] gameplay.

== Obtaining ==
Petrified oak slabs are unobtainable in new [[Survival]] worlds. They can be obtained only by using [[commands]] such as {{cmd|give}} or placed in the world using commands such as {{cmd|setblock}}.

=== Breaking ===
Petrified oak slabs require a [[pickaxe]] to mine. When broken, they drop themselves {{in|java}} or regular [[oak slab]]s {{in|bedrock}}.

{{Breaking row|Petrified Oak Slab|horizontal=1|foot=1|Pickaxe|Wooden}}

=== Crafting ===
Petrified oak slabs are uncraftable in current versions without the use of a [[data pack]] or [[behavior pack]].

=== Upgrading ===
Petrified oak slabs are obtainable and craftable as one would expect in versions released before [[Java Edition 1.3.1]] (snapshot [[12w17a]]) or [[Pocket Edition v0.7.3 alpha]], in which they are the only wooden slab type.

== Usage ==
{{main|Slab#Usage}}
Petrified oak slabs are functionally like other slabs and share most of their placement, collision, and other block behaviors with them. They date back to the earliest releases when there was only one kind of wooden slab, which had the texture of oak planks but was implemented as a variant of the generic slab, all other variants of which were made of stone. It therefore had stone properties as well.

When other species of planks were introduced, true wooden slabs were added to the game with variants for each species and properties more appropriate for wood. From then on, all wooden slabs that were crafted or generated in structures were of the real wood type, but the stone variants can still exist in older worlds. These stonelike "wooden" slabs are noteworthy for how their behavior differs from what their name and appearance imply.

=== Differences from normal slabs ===
Unlike other wooden slabs:

* Petrified oak slabs make the sounds characteristic of [[stone]].
* They require a pickaxe to [[#Breaking|mine]]. If broken without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.
* They are not [[Fire|flammable]], nor are they set on fire by nearby [[lava]].
* They cannot be used as fuel in a [[furnace]].
* They have a greater blast resistance.
* [[Note block]]s placed on top produce bass drum sounds, similarly to other stone-like blocks.

Unlike other slabs in general:
* They cannot be crafted or obtained normally in Survival.
* They do not have a direct full-block equivalent.
* {{IN|bedrock}} they do not drop themselves, but rather drop an [[oak slab]].

== Sounds ==
{{IN|Bedrock}}, when a petrified oak slab is combined into a double slab, the block's use sound is played.<ref>{{Bug|MCPE-79659||Placing a second slab on a slab plays the wrong sound event|None}}</ref>

{{HistoryTable

|{{HistoryLine||1.3|Added petrified oak slabs.
|Petrified oak slabs were the "usual" wood slab in this version, as they were craftable from planks like all other slabs were, and accordingly named "Wooden Slab" in item form.
|Their behavior was due to sharing a block ID with all other slabs at the time, distinguished only by metadata, which could not define other block properties such as material and hardness.
|The crafting recipe originally only produced 3 wooden slabs.
