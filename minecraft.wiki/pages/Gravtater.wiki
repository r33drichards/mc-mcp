A '''gravtater''' is a joke [[block]] added in [[24w14potato]]. It generates naturally in the [[Potato dimension]] and is essentially a potato variant of [[sand]].

=== Natural generation ===
Gravtater covers most of the surface of the [[hash]] biome. It also generates in blobs throughout the entire Potato dimension, similarly to how [[gravel]] generates in [[Overworld]].

== Usage ==
Gravtater can replace [[sand]] for most purposes. 

It is affected by gravity, and if the [[block]] generates floating, it produces falling dust particles. Gravtater can be used to craft [[TNT]] and be smelted into glass (as shown below), however it cannot be used to craft sandstone or concrete powder.[[Cactus]] and [[bamboo]] can grow on gravtater, and [[sugar cane]] can also grow if the block is adjacent to water. [[Turtle]]s can lay their eggs on gravtater. [[Sculk catalyst]]s can replace gravtater with [[sculk]] blocks.

Unlike [[sand]], this block supports growing [[potato]]es, like farmland.
