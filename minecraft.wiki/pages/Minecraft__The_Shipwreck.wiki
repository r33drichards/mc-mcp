== Synopsis ==

[[Jake Thomas]] is always the new kid. His family moves so much for his dad’s work that it’s easier to keep his head down and not get attached to anyone. He’ll be gone in a few months anyway. But when they end up in [[Los Angeles]], Dad promises this will be the last time they move. The [[Pacific Crest Apartments]] are home now... which means it’s time for Jake to finally make friends.

Jake isn’t sure he should count the two kids he meets at the apartment’s community center as friends, though. [[Tank Vuong]] is a large and intimidating boy who hangs with a tough crowd, and [[Emily Quesada]] is a fashionista who’s quick with a sarcastic remark. But when he discovers an old [[computer]] lab in a forgotten corner of the community center, with a strange Minecraft [[server]] containing cryptic riddles, he realizes he’s going to need help cracking the code—because at the end of the summer, the community center will be demolished, and all hope of solving the mystery will go with it. Following the hints left by an enigmatic figure known as [[The Wizard]], the trio journeys into the dangerous depths of the [[ocean]], where uncanny creatures lurk and untold treasure awaits...<ref name=TheShipwreckNovel/>

== Quotes ==
{{Q| It’s the kind of story I’m most drawn to, like, you think you're just playing the standard game and then you realize it isn’t, that someone has made this world and left clues here. That’s the gift of video games, and it’s something that can entirely happen in Minecraft and that’s what drew me into creating this mystery for these kids to fall into. One of my favorite aspects of the game is the underwater monuments and I was just really inspired by that whole aesthetic. The forgotten server all started with the idea of mermaids that were these players’ first clue they weren’t in a vanilla server, and I created the whole mystery from there.|{{w|C. B.
