An '''oak''' is the most common [[tree]] in the game, found in a variety of [[biome]]s and available in several variants. It has the smallest initial space requirement for growth, and along with [[dark oak|dark oaks]], its [[leaves]] have a chance to drop an [[apple]]. As with [[birch]]es and [[cherries]], an oak grown near [[flower]]s can generate with a [[bee nest]] attached.

There are three variants of the oak tree: small regular oaks, tall and branching '''fancy oaks''', and '''[[swamp oak]]s'''.

== Appearance ==
Oaks come in several variants with different properties:
* Small regular oaks are the most common. The leaves are arranged the same as the [[Birch#Leaf arrangement|birch leaf arrangement]].
* Fancy oaks are less common and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have branches, outgrowths of logs on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding logs surrounded by leaves. The sapling requires 4&ndash;14 blocks of open space directly above to grow (air or leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides.
** A fancy oak form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, rarely allowing a tree to grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise, the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6. Branches and outgrowths, however, require 8 blocks of open space directly above the sapling. 
** An oak can be forced into a fancy configuration if a "brace" of non-solid blocks (e.g. glass or slabs) is placed around where the trunk would be, one block off the ground.
** A rare variant is colloquially known as a "balloon" oak. This is a fancy oak generated with the smallest size possible. It consists of a tall trunk and leaves that form a spherical shape, similar to a balloon. These oaks can grow around an obstructing block. They usually contain 4 blocks of logs, but some may contain more.
* In swamp biomes, naturally occurring swamp oaks tend to grow in the water. Unlike trees in other biomes, which typically have a slightly conical or pointed canopy, all swamp oaks have round, flat-topped canopies. Also, unlike oaks, these have a broad range of foliage. They tend to be covered in [[vines]] that trail down to the ground.
* Two unique oak with unique leaf arrangements generate in some structures and cannot be grown from saplings:
** An oak with a unique arrangement of leaves is generated at [[Village/Structure/Blueprints#Meeting Point 3|meeting point 3]] in plains [[village]]s. 
** A solitary oak has a {{frac|2|9}} (22.2%) chance to appear as "[[Trial Chambers/Structure#Entrances|display 1]]" inside [[trial chambers]] entrances.

== Generation ==
The oak variants generate naturally in the following biomes:

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of oak:
* {{BlockLink|Oak Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Oak Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Sapling}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{ItemLink|Apple}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Bee Nest}} (if spawned on an oak near flowers)
* {{BlockLink|Vines}} (harvested with shears from a swamp oak, or from a dying tree)

== Planting ==
Oak [[sapling]]s can be planted and grown on all of these blocks:
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}

An oak requires a 1×1 column of unobstructed space at least 4 blocks above its sapling to grow (5 blocks including the sapling itself). Oaks can still grow when the base and trunk are enclosed on all sides. Their growth is not hindered by [[log]]s, [[leaves]], dirt, or saplings.

An oak grown from a sapling within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a [[bee nest]] containing 2-3 bees.

==Other oak variants==
Oak trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143349/http://i.imgur.com/hTg0N8J.gifv</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-21304}}</ref>

=== Fallen oaks ===
{{main|Fallen tree}}
[[File:Oak Fallen Log.png|200px|A fallen oak log.]]

These trees consist of a single upright log or stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1&ndash;2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.

A fallen oak has a log length of 4&ndash;7 blocks and the stump is 75% covered with vines.

=== Dying oaks ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Dying Trees.jpg|thumb|The different dying tree types.]]
Dying oaks retain their standard growth pattern. However, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with [[vines]]. They can generate as regular or small oaks.
