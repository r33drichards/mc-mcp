'''"ward"''' refers to both a song composed by [[C418]], and a [[music disc]] that plays the song when inserted in a [[jukebox]]. The music disc is obtained from [[creeper]]s killed by [[skeleton]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
When killed by any [[skeleton]], [[stray]], [[bogged]], or [[parched]] (or [[wither skeleton]] if given a [[bow]] using commands), a [[creeper]] drops a random music disc, which has a {{frac|1|12}} chance to be "ward".

Because [[TNT]] ignited by a flaming [[arrow]] attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with [[Flame]], or shooting through [[lava]] or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.<ref>{{bug|MC-210303|||WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-150884|||WAI}}</ref>

[[File:Ward.ogg]]

"ward" starts off with an excerpt from Chopin's Funeral March<ref>{{w|File:Frederic_Chopin_Piano_Sonata_No.2_in_B_flat_minor_Op35_-_III_Marche_Funebre.ogg|Frédéric Chopin - Piano Sonata No.2 - III ''Marche Funèbre''}}</ref> played on a synth organ, but it is interrupted by vinyl static and switches to an electronic, upbeat tune with a dark undertone. The track then fades in vinyl static, before an uplifting electronic tune closes out the song.

The album version of "ward" shortens the Chopin's beginning.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "ward" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "ward", it will emit a redstone signal of 10.
