'''22w03a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18.2]], released on January 19, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w03a|January 19, 2022}}</ref> which adds a new command and fixes bugs. This is the first snapshot released in 2022.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|placefeature}}'''
* Used to place a configured feature at a given location.
* Syntax: {{cmd|placefeature <feature> [<pos>]|link=none}}
** <code>feature</code>: The namespaced ID of a configured feature to place.
** <code>pos</code>: The position to use as the origin for the feature placement.
*** If omitted, <code>~ ~ ~</code> is used.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Now contains the chunk position in the region file, and the name of this region file which the player is currently in, in the end of the "Chunk" row.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Friulian.<ref group=note>Also available for versions since [[21w37a]].</ref>

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>#fall_damage_resetting</code> block tag.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Ender chest]]'''
* No longer gift wrapped around Christmas.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Eroded badlands]]'''
* Tweaked generation to generate more cohesively with the rest of the surrounding badlands.

'''[[Seed (world generation)|Seed]]s'''
* A seed of the number zero is no longer handled as a special case.
* Any spaces before/after an inputted seed are now trimmed.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Now uses a namespaced ID parameter.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Moved the location of the player within a chunk from "Chunk" row, into the new square brackets at the end of the "Block" row.

'''Logging'''
* Upgrades log4j to 2.17.0.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
