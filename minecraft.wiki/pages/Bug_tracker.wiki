The '''Mojang Bug Tracker''' (also known as '''Mojira'''<ref>{{Citation|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408887473421#:~:text=The%20Mojang%20Bug%20Tracker%20(also%20known%20by%20its%20nickname%20Mojira)|title=Mojang Bug Tracker Guidelines {{!}} Minecraft Help|author=[[Mojang Studios]]|website=[[Minecraft.net]]|quote=The Mojang Bug Tracker (also known by its nickname Mojira)}}</ref>) is the official website for players to report bugs for ''[[Minecraft]]''. It uses [https://atlassian.com/ Atlassian's] [https://atlassian.com/software/jira/overview Jira] platform. Similar to [[Crowdin]], it is community moderated.

== History ==
[[File:Bugtracker.png|thumb|The first screenshot of the bug tracker.]]
Previously, the [[MCW:Issues|issues]] page on the [[Minecraft Wiki (website)|Minecraft Wiki]] was used to maintain issue reports. Many people complained that the process was too complicated.
Due to the high demand for a proper bug tracker instead of using the wiki, [[Mojang]] contacted Atlassian, which became their choice due to being flexible and customizable.
An email was sent to Atlassian to gain help on making a proper bug tracker. Atlassian immediately offered to help, providing a free JIRA license. A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMRmOIGaFnw video] was published to showcase their improved JIRA developer's API for JIRA v5.0.

=== Announcement ===
{{q|Although this new Minecraft bug tracker will mostly be community organized and run, it will be the official location to report bugs in Minecraft that we’ll be keeping an eye on. [...] We’ll be using this new bug tracker for all future releases of Minecraft. If you’re already familiar with JIRA and want to get right into reporting a bug, go check out the new [http://minecraft.net/bugs/pc Minecraft Bug Tracker here]!|Mojang<ref>{{link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710054814/https://www.mojang.com/2012/10/introducing-the-minecraft-bug-tracker|title=Introducing the Minecraft Bug Tracker!|website=Mojang.com|date=October 24, 2012|author=[[Erik Broes]]}}</ref>}}

On October 24, 2012, the bug tracker was officially released by [[Erik Broes]] and [https://atlassian.com Atlassian] using their issue tracker, [https://atlassian.com/software/jira/overview JIRA].

=== Migration ===
From February 10, 2025, the bug tracker started migrating from the deprecated Jira Server to a newer cloud-based Jira service because Atlassian has ended support for the Jira Server software.<ref>{{Mcnet|changes-to-minecraft-bug-reporting-system|Changes to our bug reporting system|January 10, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/server-end-of-support|title=Server end of support|website=Atlassian}}</ref> The migration includes all bug reports, but user accounts required explicit permission until February 10 (extended from January 31).<ref>{{Mcnet|final-days-to-migrate-your-bug-account|Final days to migrate your bug account|January 31, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Discord

== Trivia ==
* ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' uses the "MCPE" tag as it is the successor to ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' and took over its project on the bug tracker at the [[Better Together Update]].
* January 26, 2024, was the first time the MC project had 0 unconfirmed reports (apart from when it was created). This is the first time this has happened in the history of the bug tracker. This occurred for the second time on November 7, 2025
