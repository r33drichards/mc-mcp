In the [[4k-JavaScript|JavaScript version]] of ''[[Minecraft 4k]]'', '''water''' has a block ID of 9.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Since the mechanic for breaking blocks was completely removed in the version the block was added, there is no way to obtain or break it.

=== Natural generation ===
The block generates randomly throughout the world in a tunnel-like formation.

== Texture ==
{{info needed section|describe the code used - not yet implemented by MC-TextureGen, so someone will have to examine the code}}
The texture for water was presumably generated by the game at runtime (similarly to [[Procedural animated texture generation|what was done in Java Edition at that time for water and lava]]), rather than being stored inside of the code as an image file. There have been no attempts to implement this algorithm elsewhere so far.
