=== Additions ===
==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Effect]]s'''
*Added [[Raid Omen]].
**Instead of triggering a Raid directly, Bad Omen will transform into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds.
**Once the Raid Omen expires, a Raid will start at the location the player gained the Raid Omen.
**Like any other effect, players can drink a [[Bucket of Milk]] to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the Raid from starting.
*Added activation sounds to [[Bad Omen]], [[Trial Omen]], and [[Raid Omen]].

'''[[Enchantments]]'''
*The [[mace]] now has three brand new enchantments available for use:
**[[Wind Burst]] generates a burst of wind when successfully striking enemies, launching the wielder in the air.
**[[Density]] makes the already heavy mace even heavier, adding additional heft to its smash attack.
**[[Breach]] allows the mace to bypass a portion of an enemy's armor, striking fear into the hearts of even the most protected enemies.

==== Items ====
'''[[Painting]]s'''
*Added five new paintings by the artist [[Sarah Boeving]]:
