== Biography ==
Before the series began, Slugger was mushroom brawler.

Slugger was once teleported along with [[Mo]] by [[CommuniKate]] using a [[command block]]. In the second trial, she saves [[Toby]] from the [[Cave Spider]]s, but still loses, and then Mo triggered her own death by explosion to save her friends, which led to Slugger's elimination from the show. Then she with other heroes was saved from obsidian prison and their sabotage succeeds, but instead of going home, they are teleported to the [[Greek Isles]]. [[Poseidon]] teleported Slugger to a sand pillar in the [[Kraken]] sea along with the other heroes, and she spent most of the season there. Then at the end, all the heroes escape and try to stop Poseidon. After a while, [[Zeus]] comes, stops s Poseidon, and asks heroes to help him. After helping the god, Slugger and Mo apparently returned home.
