A '''bucket of tadpole''', also known as a '''tadpole bucket''', is a [[tadpole]] inside of a [[water bucket]]. The color of water is changed to be similar to water in a [[swamp]], which is {{color|#617B64}}.

== Obtaining ==
A bucket of tadpole can be obtained by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on a [[tadpole]]. Once a water bucket is used, the tadpole is picked up along with the water source block.

== Usage ==
Pressing {{control|use}} with a bucket of tadpole places a [[water]] source block, and spawns the tadpole back into the world, leaving an [[bucket|empty bucket]] in the [[player]]'s [[inventory]]. Placing a bucket of tadpole in [[the Nether]] causes the same [[particle]]s to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the tadpole is spawned alone.

Tadpoles caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments. However, they still grow into [[frog]]s.

If a bucket of tadpole is inside a [[dispenser]], the dispenser spawns the tadpole and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty [[bucket]] inside. Dispensers cannot pick up a tadpole when using a water bucket, due to the bucket being emptied instead.

If a bucket of tadpole is named a certain name through an [[anvil]], the tadpole inside displays that name as if it were named with a [[Name Tag|name tag]].{{Only|java}} Alternatively, if a named tadpole is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of tadpole shares a name with the captured tadpole.{{Only|java}} If a named tadpole is captured {{in|Bedrock}}, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".
