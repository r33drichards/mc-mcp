A '''chicken jockey'''<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|406775245765619712|I saw this on reddit and had to make it a real thing: Chicken Jockeys.|November 30, 2013}}</ref> and various other jockeys are the rare appearance of a baby [[zombie]] or [[husk]], or a baby [[zombie villager]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglin]]{{only|je|short=1}}{{upcoming|be 26.0}} riding a [[chicken]]{{only|je|short=1}} or most common [[mobs]].{{only|be|short=1}}

== Spawning ==
{{IN|java}}, [[chicken]] jockeys spawn directly in the world, like all other mobs. {{IN|bedrock}}, baby zombies and certain variants do not spawn directly but instead mount other nearby mobs.

=== Direct spawning ===
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Each baby zombie, baby zombie villager, baby husk, baby drowned or baby zombified piglin that spawns naturally has a 5% chance to check for an existing [[chicken]] within an approximately 10×6×10 (L*H*W) box centered on the baby's spawn location and spawn riding one of those chickens if there are any. If it fails that 5% chance, there is an additional 5% chance of the baby spawning mounted on a new adult chicken.

Therefore, in a chicken-free environment, each baby zombie has a 4.75% chance of spawning directly as a chicken jockey. If chickens are present, this chance increases to 9.75%.

Taking into consideration the fact that each type of zombie has a 5% chance of spawning as a baby, each spawned zombie has a 0.2375% chance of directly spawning as a chicken jockey in a chicken-free environment. If chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.

Chickens that are mounted by zombies despawn naturally, cannot lay eggs, and drop {{xp|10}} experience instead of the usual {{xp|1|3}}. If a jockey spawns riding a new chicken, the [[Chicken#Variants|variant of the chicken]] depends on the biome it spawns in. If a jockey spawns riding an existing chicken, the chicken keeps its NBT data (variant, health, custom name, age, etc), but its <code>IsChickenJockey</code> tag is set to <code>1</code>.

Chicken jockeys can sometimes spawn with equipment. Zombie, zombie villager and husk chicken jockeys may spawn holding an [[iron sword]], [[iron spear]], or [[iron shovel]], and wearing [[armor]]. Drowned chicken jockeys may spawn holding a [[trident]], [[fishing rod]], or [[nautilus shell]]. Zombified piglin chicken jockeys always spawn holding a [[golden sword]] or [[golden spear]]. 

Although chickens take damage from standing on [[magma block]]s, zombified piglin chicken jockeys still spawn on them, killing the chicken and leaving just the baby zombified piglin.

Zombified piglin chicken jockeys do not become hostile if the chicken is attacked or killed.

Due to the biomes the riders spawn in, husk and zombified piglin chicken jockeys can only spawn with a warm chicken, unless they spawn riding an existing chicken. If a zombified piglin chicken jockey spawns from a [[Nether Portal (block)|Nether portal block]], the variant of the chicken depends on the biome the portal block is located in.

=== Mounting ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombies, baby husks{{until|BE 26.0}}, and {{inUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} baby drowned and baby zombie villagers, can mount other mobs when spawned. This includes baby zombies summoned by [[monster spawner]]s and [[spawn eggs]]. Such a mob can be [[summoned]] with the <code>minecraft:as_baby_jockey</code> [[spawn event]]. 

The following mobs can be mounted:

{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s
* {{EntityLink|Cow|Cows}}
* {{EntitySprite|Pig}} Adult unsaddled [[pig]]s
* {{EntityLink|Sheep}}
* {{EntityLink|Mooshroom|Mooshrooms}}
* {{EntitySprite|Ocelot}} Wild [[ocelot]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Cat}} Stray [[cat]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Angry Wolf}} Wild [[wolves]]
* {{EntitySprite|Horse}} Wild adult [[horse]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Donkey}} Wild adult [[donkey]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Mule}} Untamed adult [[mule]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Skeleton Horse}} Adult [[skeleton horse]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Zombie Horse}} Adult [[zombie horse]]s
* {{EntityLink|Panda|Pandas}}
* {{EntitySprite|Zombie}} Adult zombies
* {{EntitySprite|Husk}} Adult [[husk]]s
* {{EntitySprite|zombie villager}} Adult [[zombie villager]]s
* {{EntitySprite|zombified piglin}} Adult [[zombified piglin]]s
* {{EntityLink|Spider|Spiders}} that were not spawned as a [[spider jockey]]
* {{EntityLink|Cave Spider|Cave spiders}} that were not spawned as a spider jockey
}}

Additionally, in [[Bedrock Edition 26.0]]{{upcoming}}, baby [[drowned]] can also mount untamed [[zombie nautiluses]] if nearby, like the adult drowned, but they do not actively search for a zombie nautilus to mount.

Due to a bug, baby zombified piglins jockeys don't spawn properly.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/blob/493f4ffc613f7335a2a7591971d6971f210aa049/behavior_pack/entities/zombie_pigman.json#L521C1-L521C43 - This is because of a [[spawn event]] not existing in the {{cd|events}} field in the zombified piglin's {{cd|minecraft:entity}} [[JSON]] file.</ref>

Due to another bug, in Bedrock Edition 26.0{{upcoming}}, baby husks can no longer mount mobs as jockeys.<ref name="husk">https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/blob/bfe49ca826b0b51a1824dc6ca501d056341179ea/behavior_pack/entities/husk.json#L124 This is due to the {{cd|baby_undead}} family having a space at the end.</ref>

== Drops ==
The baby [[zombie]] (or variant) and the ridden mob each drop the same items they normally would. If the baby zombie or baby husk{{only|be|short=1}}<ref name=":0">{{bug|MCPE-224103||Husk Incorrectly Drops Lava Chicken Record When Riding a Chicken}}</ref> is killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]] while riding a [[chicken]], it also drops the [[Music Disc Lava Chicken|Lava Chicken music disc]]. Note that the jockey must be a zombie, not a [[zombie villager]], [[husk]],{{only|je|short=1}} [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglin]], and it must ride a chicken.

== Behavior ==
{{main|Riding}}
The jockey’s behavior is controlled by the rider.

* Chicken jockeys fall slowly and do not take fall damage, like normal chickens.
* The ridden mob can run through 1 block high gaps if its [[hitbox]] allows it. The rider suffocates unless the above block is transparent.
* The rider can pick up/equip items if capable.
* Chickens (unless spawned with commands without the {{cd|IsChickenJockey}} tag) do not lay [[egg]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-165545|||WAI}}</ref> However, they can still [[breed]] with other chickens, and the offspring do lay eggs. {{IN|BE}}, if a baby zombie or a variant mounts a normal chicken, the chicken stops laying eggs. If the rider is killed, the chicken starts laying eggs again. 
* Zombie riders (both the riders and ridden mobs<ref>{{bug|MC-48965|resolution=Works as intended}}</ref>) [[despawn]] like regular hostile mobs.
* {{IN|je}}, the chicken acts like a regular [[passive mob]] again if the rider is killed, but still does not lay eggs and may despawn.
* Only the ridden mob needs a [[name tag]] to prevent both the ridden mob and rider from despawning.
* Curing a [[zombie villager]] jockey:
** {{IN|je}}: turns it into a villager chicken jockey. The baby villager continues to ride the chicken if it grows up<ref>{{bug|MC-200418}}</ref> or turns into a [[witch]].
** {{IN|be}}:{{Upcoming|be 26.0}} dismounts the villager riding the jockey after it has been cured.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|java}}, the chance for a baby zombie villager to spawn wearing full enchanted diamond armor holding an enchanted iron sword in its left hand while riding a chicken is about 1 in 2.91082×10<sup>22</sup>, however it is still not the rarest jockey.
* {{IN|java}}, the rarest mob is the zombie villager chicken jockey from abandoned jungle village with fully enchanted diamond armor, jack o'lantern, leader attributes, and an enchanted iron sword in its left hand.
* {{IN|be}} as of [[Bedrock Edition 26.0|26.0]], there are 3074 possible zombie (variant) riders, when including all mob variants. This does not include different armor configurations for zombies, husks, and zombified piglins, wolf sound variants, and statistics.
* Zombified piglin chicken jockeys can spawn from portals in the [[Overworld]].
* A chicken jockey is the main protagonist of the openings for ''[[MINECON Live 2019]]'' and ''[[Minecraft Live 2020]]''.
