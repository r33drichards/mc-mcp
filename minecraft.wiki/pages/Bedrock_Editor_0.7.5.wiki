'''Bedrock Editor v0.7.5''' is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on October 17, 2024.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/202</ref><ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/31137892416269</ref>

== Changes ==
* Added overflow handling for menu bar to collapse overflowing items into a menu and improved submenus to fit within window bounds.
* Added {{cd|focusToolInputContext}} function to {{cd|IModalToolContainer}} which will try to set modal input focus (e.g. viewport for tool rail).
* Improved persistent settings storage. The {{cd|editorOptions.txt}} file is now located in the editor subfolder in the same {{cd|AppData}} directory.
* Improved viewport focus visibility with an animated outline on focus and added focused state as a step for Toggle Mode ({{keys|CTRL + TAB}}).

== Fixes ==
* Fixed a bug preventing the Quick Panel from being draggable using the drag icon on the header.
* Fixed a bug that caused the dropdown menu to open with an incorrect position inside a scrollable pane.
