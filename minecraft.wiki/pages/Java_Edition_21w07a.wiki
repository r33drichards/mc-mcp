'''21w07a''' is the tenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on February 17, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w07a|February 17, 2021}}</ref> which adds [[Deepslate|grimstone]] and tweaks ore and cave generation.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Deepslate.png|32px]] [[Grimstone]]'''
* A new type of [[stone]].
* Generates below Y=0. 
** Has a gradual transition from stone to grimstone starting from Y-level -1 until it reaches -8.
** Takes over fully underground starting from Y=-8.
* Functions identical to [[cobblestone]] and [[blackstone]] in that grimstone can be used to craft basic tools, furnaces and brewing stands.
* Can be used as a decorative block. 
** It can be crafted into many different variants. [[Chiseled grimstone]], [[polished grimstone]], [[grimstone bricks]], [[grimstone tiles]].
* Has a hardness value greater than that of [[stone]] but can be mined with any [[pickaxe]].
* Can't be insta-mined unlike stone.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Added {{Nbt|boolean|grimstone_enabled}} to <code>worldgen/noise_settings/*.json</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Big dripleaf]]'''
* Slightly changed model.

[[File:21w07a Texture comparison.jpg|thumb|A comparison of the old and new ore textures.]]
'''[[Blackstone]], [[polished blackstone bricks]], and [[cracked polished blackstone bricks]] and [[stair]], [[slab]] and [[wall]] variants'''
* Slightly changed the texture.

'''[[Glow lichen]]'''
* Can now naturally generate on grimstone.

'''[[Ore]]s'''
* The textures of [[coal ore]], [[diamond ore]],<!--diamond ore *did* change, just not the shape--> [[gold ore]], [[iron ore]], and [[redstone ore]] have been changed.
** Coal ore, iron ore, gold ore, and redstone ore had the shape of the "ore pattern" in the stone changed to make them visually distinct for colorblind players.
** Diamond ore remains mostly the same as it was the most iconic one of the ores that used this shape.

'''[[Beacon]] '''
* Beams are now visible up to 1343 blocks away from the source instead of 256 blocks.

=== World generation ===
[[File:21w07a Approximate ore distribution.jpg|thumb|Ore distribution changes.]]
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Noise caves and aquifers appear less often.

'''[[Mineral]] distribution'''
* Changed ore generation of all ores making them have a spread value and generate in a triangle distribution<ref>Mistakenly drawn as normal distributions in the generation chart, but corrected in the chart of the next snapshot.</ref> like [[lapis lazuli ore]]. Some still retain a linear generation alongside a spread generation.
* [[Coal ore]], [[emerald ore]], and [[copper ore]] no longer generate below Y=0.
** Copper ore generates between the Y=0 and Y=96 and like all other ores, uses spread. It peaks at Y=48.
** Emerald ore generates above Y=32 (up to Y=480 in custom worlds) as a spread, peaking at Y=256 and decreasing in quantity as the [[altitude]] decreases.
** Coal ore attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of Y=96 and generating between an altitude of Y=0 and Y=192.
* Other ores also generate differently.
** [[Iron ore]] attempts to generate twice: once as a spread peaking at an altitude of Y=256, generating above Y=128 (up to Y=384 in custom worlds); and another as a spread peaking at Y=32 and generating with a minimum height of Y=-16 and a maximum height of Y=80.
** [[Gold ore]] generates between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=32, peaking at Y=-16. The extra gold that generates in the [[badlands]] biome was left untouched.
** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, as a spread between the altitudes of Y=32 and Y=-32, peaking at an altitude of 0; and evenly between an altitude of Y=64 and Y=-64, generating buried like [[ancient debris]].
** [[Redstone ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=15 and Y=-64; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of -64 and generating below an altitude of Y=-32 (down to Y=-96 in custom worlds).
** [[Diamond ore]] now generate as a spread, generating below Y=16 and peaking at altitudes near Y=-64.
* Tweaked size and positioning of [[diorite]], [[andesite]] & [[granite]] generation.
** Pockets of diorite, granite and andesite are now larger and more spherical but less common.
** Diorite, granite, [[gravel]] and [[dirt]] no longer generate below Y=0, but gravel and dirt are more common than in pre-21w06a versions.
* [[Grimstone]] now generates as the dominant stone below Y=0.
** [[Andesite]] still generates unlike [[stone]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], and [[dirt]].

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* [[File:21w07a Mineshaft.jpg|alt=A 1.17 Mineshaft with ceiling supports and oak log supports from the ground |thumb|A 1.17 mineshaft]] Corridors are now supported by [[Iron Chain|chain]]s and oak fences above when the layer is nearer to the ceiling than the floor.
* Wood pillars are now made of [[log]]s instead of [[wood]].

'''[[Stronghold]]s'''
* Are now encased in [[stone]] and/or [[grimstone]], depending on the depth.

=== General ===
'''Creative inventory'''
* The "Redstone Tab" has been reordered to prioritize highly-used blocks.
* Redstone items/blocks have been grouped and ordered in the following way (from top to bottom): Essentials, Unique activators, Miscellaneous, Common activators, Openables.

'''Data packs'''
* Vanilla configured features for ore types have changed:
** Coal and iron have been split into two parts called <code>_upper</code> and <code>_lower</code>.
** New lapis configured feature: <code>ore_lapis_buried</code>.
* The <code>glow_lichen</code> feature now lists grimstone as a valid block.
* Changes to the <code>range</code> decorator configuration:
** <code>bottom_offset</code>, <code>top_offset</code> and <code>maximum</code> fields removed.
** Replaced with <code>bottom_inclusive</code> and <code>top_inclusive</code> which are both a new type of vertical anchoring.
** This type can have several forms:
*** <code>absolute</code> - specifies an absolute Y value.
*** <code>above_bottom</code> - specifies an offset above the minimum Y coordinate of the world.
*** <code>below_top</code> - specifies an offset below the maximum Y coordinate of the world.
* The <code>range_biased</code> and <code>range_very_biased</code> feature decorator are now called <code>range_biased_to_bottom</code> and <code>range_very_biased_to_bottom</code> respectively.
** Both biased types of ranges now have <code>bottom_inclusive</code> and <code>top_inclusive</code> of the same type, and a <code>cutoff</code> value that's a numeric value
* The <code>depth_average</code> decorator also now has its baseline field as a vertical anchor instead of an absolute Y value.
* A whole range of decorators no longer exist or have had part of their functionality replaced by using some of the already existing generic decorators:
** <code>dark_oak_tree</code> decorator no longer does a heightmap check, needs to be done with a <code>heightmap</code> decorator.
** The <code>end_gateway</code> decorator has been split, now used with a combination of <code>chance</code>, <code>square</code> & <code>heightmap</code> - see the <code>end_gateway configuration</code> in the vanilla pack for an example.
** The <code>glowstone_blob</code> feature no longer does its own decoration, instead is used with a combination of <code>square</code> & <code>range</code>. See <code>glowstone_extra</code> in vanilla files for example.
** The <code>lava_lake</code> feature has also been split, now used with <code>chance</code>, <code>square</code>, and <code>range_biased_to_bottom</code>. See <code>lake_lava</code> for an example.
** The <code>water_lake</code> decorator has been removed. Now instead <code>chance</code>, <code>square</code> & <code>range</code>.
** The <code>emerald_ore</code> decorator has been removed. Now instead <code>count</code>, <code>square</code> & <code>range</code>.
** The <code>fire</code> decorator has been removed. Now instead <code>range</code>, <code>square</code> & <code>count</code>.
** The <code>carving_mask</code> no longer has a probability field, replaced with a <code>chance</code> decorator.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added grimstone to the <code>base_stone_overworld</code> block tag and the <code>stone_crafting_materials</code> and <code>stone_tool_materials</code> item tags.
* Added various grimstone variants to the {{cd|slabs|stairs|walls|d=and}} block and item tags.
