'''Cookies'''{{fn|Also known as '''biscuits''' in [[Language#Differences between English variants|Australian, British and New Zealand English]].}} are [[food]] items that can be obtained in large quantities, but do not restore hunger or saturation significantly.

=== Villager gifts ===
{{IN|java}}, if the [[player]] has the [[Hero of the Village]] effect, a farmer villager may gift them a cookie.

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
To eat a cookie, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|2}} [[hunger]] and 0.4 hunger 
[[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Parrots ===
{{IN|java}} feeding a cookie to a [[parrot]] kills the parrot instantly and gives the parrot the [[Poison]] effect as it dies.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, feeding a cookie to a parrot gives the parrot the [[Fatal Poison]] effect instead, and the effect will kill the parrot within a few seconds.

=== Composting ===
Placing a cookie into a [[composter]] has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

Considering the high yield of cookies (8 cookies from 1 cocoa bean and 2 wheat) and the higher chance to successfully compost a cookie (85%), it is more efficient to craft cookies to compost rather than using separate ingredients. For example, 100 wheat and 50 cocoa beans, which in total could yield only 13.92 bone meal on average, could be crafted into 400 cookies to yield 48.57 bone meal on average.
