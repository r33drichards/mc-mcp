The '''End sky''' is an inverted cube rendered in [[the End]] dimension.

== Description ==
The End sky is rendered in any dimension which uses the [[Effect (dimension)|dimension effect]] associated with the End. Much like the [[panorama]], six texture planes are rendered in a cube surrounding the camera. The texture is repeated 16 times to an edge, for a total of 256 instances of the texture per face (1536 for the entire cube).

The texture file will always point to {{code|environment/end_sky}}, and cannot be customized on a per-dimension basis. In addition, the graphic will also be rendered much darker in-game; {{in|JE}} this is due to it being [[tint]]ed a dark gray ({{color|#282828}}).{{check the code|does Bedrock Edition achieve this effect differently?}} {{iN|bedrock}}, the [[Night Vision]] effect will cause it to render brighter.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the End sky is colored purple around and below the horizon, and black at zenith. This color is rendered on top of the End sky texture.

== End flash ==

The End flash is a [[weather]]-like event that occurs {{in|bedrock}} with [[Vibrant Visuals]] turned on and {{in|je}} with any graphics mode. Lighting becomes purple tinted during the flash, and a rumbling sound effect plays. There is a 30 second delay between flashes, and each flash lasts between 5 and 19 seconds. Flashes occur at random spots in the sky, at differing heights above the horizon. The flash still occurs even if the [[ender dragon]] is currently active and is obstructing the End sky with its fog; however, the main flash effect won't be visible, leaving only the tinting and sound as tangible effects.

End flashes can be disabled in the accessibility [[settings]].

With Vibrant Visuals, the End flash is considered a global directional lighting source, which can produce tinted reflections on objects and cast shadows in the opposite direction of the flash. During an End flash, dense and purple [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] becomes visible.
