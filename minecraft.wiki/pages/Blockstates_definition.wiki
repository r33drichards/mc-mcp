'''Blockstates definition''' (also known as '''block state model dispatch'''<ref>Name used by Mojang {{snap|25w46a}}</ref>) are used to render blocks there are several different variants of them (like [[door]]s, which can be open or closed). Each block has its own blockstates definition file, which lists all the existing variants and links them to their corresponding model. Blocks can also be composed of several different models at the same time, called "multipart". The models are then used depending on the [[block state]] of the block.

The blockstates definitions are stored as [[JSON]] files in a [[resource pack]] in the <code>assets/''<namespace>''/blockstates</code> folder.
