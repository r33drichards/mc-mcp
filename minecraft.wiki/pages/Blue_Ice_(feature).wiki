'''Blue ice blobs''' ''(also called blue ice features)'' are a [[feature]] that places [[blue ice]] in [[frozen ocean]] biomes.

== Generation ==
The blue ice blobs generate at the bottom of [[Iceberg (feature)|packed ice icebergs]]. They generate similarly to [[Ore (feature)#:~:text=ore%20blobs|rock blobs]] of [[diorite]], [[andesite]], and [[granite]]. The blob can also be described as a pile of blue ice generating adjacent to a [[Packed Ice|packed ice]]. The blue ice always generate at or below the surface of water (i.e. {{Cd|1=y<=64}}), and can replace some existing packed ice within the iceberg, just like how:

* rock blocks can replace stone,
* and ore blobs can replace both rock blobs.

Blue ice features are put near the bottoms of icebergs in order to make them more realistic, because real glaciers tend to have denser ice at the bottom of them, and blue ice represents a denser form of packed ice.
