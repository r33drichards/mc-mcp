'''1.16.4 Pre-release 1''' (known as '''1.16.4-pre1''' in the [[launcher]]) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.16.4]], released on October 15, 2020,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-16-4-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.16.4 Pre-release 1|October 15, 2020}}</ref> which adds the social interactions screen and fixes two bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
* Added [[Social interactions screen]].
** Gives players the ability to disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages receiving from them.
** Opens with a configurable key binding, by default {{keys|P}}.
** Whether a player is hidden resets when re-joining a server.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Netherite leggings]]'''
* Changed the texture of the worn netherite leggings model.

=== General ===
'''[[Crash]]es'''
* More information is now added to the crash log in cases where poor performance causes the server to crash.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "joinedFirstServer" option to <samp>[[options.txt]]</samp>.

'''[[Protocol version]]s'''
* New network protocol scheme, with a high bit (bit 30) set for snapshots. The protocol version will increase by 1 for each snapshot, but full releases may keep the same protocol version as the previous full release in cases where the network protocols are compatible.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* When the server and client version are incompatible, a message reading "Incompatible version!" is displayed, instead of "Client out of date!" or "Server out of date!".

== Fixes ==
