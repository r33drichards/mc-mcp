Throughout several events such as ''[[Minecon]]'' and ''[[Minecraft Live]]'', '''demo content''' has been shown but not released to the public to demonstrate features that can be used in [[worlds]].

== ''Minecon'' ==

Featured during [[MINECON Live 2019|''MINECON Live 2019'']], the Creative Tools were created by to be used by [[Marketplace]] developers.<ref>{{YouTube link|Gn8wf362iQg|MINECON Live 2019: Creative Tools in Minecraft Bedrock|Minecraft|October 2, 2019|t=1m21s}}</ref> The tools created by G2Crafted are available for download ([https://www.mediafire.com/file/gkeqhydwsglwloo/G2_Crafted_Behav.mcpack/file behavior pack] and [https://www.mediafire.com/file/x28hm1f83vab99y/G2_Crafted_Resou.mcpack/file resource pack]).<ref>{{tweet|g2crafted|1178014466941825024|Minecon live tools by G2 Crafted free Downloads just type in  /function g2items1  or /function g2items2  https://mediafire.com/file/gkeqhydwsglwloo/G2_Crafted_Behav.mcpack/file  http://mediafire.com/file/x28hm1f83vab99y/G2_Crafted_Resou.mcpack/file  #Minecraft We are making 3x the amount of tools coming to the Market Place.

=== Super Hero ===
Showcased during the same segment as the Creative Tools, Super Hero was a map developed by Shapescape, which took advantage of the previously featured mechanics. The map gave players the ability to use several superpowers through the [[inventory]], including an evolution of the [[Enderman|endermen]]'s teleportation, a "magic missile" used to fight [[Skeleton|skeletons]], and an energy shield that can be placed on the ground.<ref>{{YouTube link|Gn8wf362iQg|MINECON Live 2019: Creative Tools in Minecraft Bedrock|Minecraft|October 2, 2019|t=5m}}</ref> 

=== Penguin map ===
{{Conjecture|section=1}}
Following Super Hero, a map developed by [[Jason Major]] was showcased where the [[player]] model is replaced by a [[penguin]], with the [[sprinting]] animation becoming a belly slide.<ref>{{YouTube link|Gn8wf362iQg|MINECON Live 2019: Creative Tools in Minecraft Bedrock|Minecraft|October 2, 2019|t=6m01s}}</ref>

== ''Minecraft Live'' ==

=== Tomatoes ===
Presented at ''[[Minecraft Live 2020]]'', the Tomatoes add-on consisted of a tomato [[Crops|crop]], which can be collected similar to [[Sweet Berries|sweet berries]] and {{Control|thrown}}. If left unattended, the crop will begin to rot, and spawn in a "rotten tomato monster," which throws rotten tomatoes, also projectiles but with a shorter distance and higher knockback.<ref>{{YouTube link|oGThu5q-O3E|Minecraft Live: Creator Tools|Minecraft|October 16, 2020|t=2m24s}}</ref>

** appears when tomatoes begin to rot
* Tomato Crops

=== Golden Skull adventure ===
{{Conjecture|section=1}}Following the Tomato demonstration, an adventure map set in a desert was shown. The player was given a golden skull item and lightning sword, the former being used to activate a pedestal, which opened a cave in a "hollow mountain." Inside were several [[Husk|husks]], riding [[Minecon 2018 New Entity Sample|scorpions]], which could be attacked by hitting them with the sword, which generates actual [[Thunderstorm|lightning]].<ref>{{YouTube link|oGThu5q-O3E|Minecraft Live: Creator Tools|Minecraft|October 16, 2020|t=5m24s}}</ref>

The map was designed to showcase several then new features, such as items being locked to the inventory so they can't be lost.

=== Sci-fi Parkour ===
{{Conjecture|section=1}}Following the Tomato and adventure map demonstrations, a second map was revealed, described as a "sci-fi, parkour course." The map is a simple parkour course, set on metallic platforms with a [[ladder]] trick, and then a "slimenator" item which converts blocks to [[Slime Block|slime blocks]] when {{Control|thrown}}. After using a teleporter, the player continues through to another area with a slight elevation, before another puzzle solved with a "blockinator." This item creates a small platform of [[Slab|slabs]] to help traverse, similar to the hook. Upon reaching a platform, a chest is found containing a "levitation cyberdog" and antidote, the former granting [[levitation]], [[wither]], [[poison]], and [[nausea]], while the latter heals all but levitation. 

A third section follows, containing a wall which can be broken with a wand and 17 magic gems, which function like a [[bow]] and [[arrow]]. The final teleporter pad is blocked off, requiring the player to climb up a ladder and fall on top of the block blocking the path. Upon completing the map, the player will be transported into a room with a [[FannyVH]] NPC and a final [[chest]], with text appearing displaying the amount of times the player died.<ref>{{YouTube link|oGThu5q-O3E|Minecraft Live: Creator Tools|Minecraft|October 16, 2020|t=8m45s}}</ref>

=== Entity Wizard mobs ===
Demonstrated by Jannis, the creator of Blockbench, at [[Minecraft Live 2021|''Minecraft Live 2021'']], the butterfly and grizzly bear were simple add-ons created to demonstrate the release of the Entity Wizard.<ref>{{YouTube link|HaGdVUcHIbE|Minecraft Live 2021: Minecraft Marketplace|Minecraft|October 22, 2021|t=6m19s}}</ref> Minecraft Live co-hosts Fanny Vadillo Herrera and Quinn also demonstrated simple mobs of their own, showing off [[wolf]] variants modeled after her dogs and a sentient tree named Evelyn Evergreen respectively, one made from reskinning a mob and the other from scratch. Afterwards, [[Lydia Winters]] demonstrated a mob she made herself, the "aloto," a hybrid of an [[axolotl]] and alligator.<ref>{{YouTube link|HaGdVUcHIbE|Minecraft Live 2021: Minecraft Marketplace|Minecraft|October 22, 2021|t=8m38s}}</ref>

=== Create Your Own Mob with Blockbench! ===
{{Main|Minecraft Live 2022 Sample Pack}}
During [[Minecraft Live 2022|''Minecraft Live 2022'']], several mobs created with Entity Wizard were showcased. Many of them would be released in an add-on following the broadcast, but not all of them were included. These include creature3, Bombie, the Pumpkin King, and a humanoid banana designed by [[Daniel Middleton]].<ref>{{YouTube link|kE0PJJlhDFA|Minecraft Live 2022: Create Your Own Mob with Blockbench!|Minecraft|October 22, 2022}}</ref>

== Blockbench Feature Hype ==
The ''Blockbench Feature Hype'' videos, also known as ''Minecraft Tutorial Series'', were a series of videos demonstrating the Entity Wizard feature on [[Blockbench]]. At least two videos were created by Patrick Rodes, both featuring separate add-ons: a "cake golem" using a [[Snow Golem|snow golem]] as a basis, and a motorcycle ridden by [[Makena]].<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.artstation.com/artwork/n0od66|title=Cake Golem Blockbench Tutorial|author=Patrick Rodes|website=ArtStation|date=July 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.artstation.com/artwork/w0DOmw|title=Animation Presets Blockbench Tutorial|author=Patrick Rodes|website=ArtStation|date=July 15, 2024}}</ref>
