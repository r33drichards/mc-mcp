=== Downloadable content ===
In 2021, BigB was one of several YouTubers selected to appear in the [[YouTube Creators Skin Pack]], celebrating a trillion views of ''Minecraft'' content on [[YouTube]]. He would later voice himself in [[Caves & Cliffs Explorers]], reusing the design from the [[skin pack]].

=== MINECON ===
In 2017, Anthony appeared as a guest during [[MINECON Earth 2017|MINECON Earth]], as well as during the pre-show.<ref>{{Tweet|Bigbst4tz2|932023350154670081|Just realized we were in the Pre-Show for #MineconEarth Thank you @Mojang  @Minecraft}}</ref> He returned the [[MINECON Earth 2018|next year]] as a host.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecon-2018-co-host-big-b-statz|MINECON Earth Co-Host: Big B Statz|March 26, 2018|Staff}}</ref>

=== ''Minecraft: Story Mode'' ===
During [[Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two]], Viviano made an appearance as a fictonalized version himself. Unlike previous {{MCSM|YouTubers}}, he was referred to solely as {{MCSM|Anthony}}, as opposed to any of his nicknames.

== Trivia ==

* His skin is taken from [[Skin Pack 5]], and is meant to represent {{Wikipedia|Lee Everett}} from ''{{Wikipedia|The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead}}''. Coincidentally, the voice of the character, [[Dave Fennoy]], also appeared in {{MCSM}}.
