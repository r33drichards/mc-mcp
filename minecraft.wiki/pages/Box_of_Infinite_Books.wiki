The '''box of infinite books''' is a joke [[block]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]] that provides a [[written book]] containing random text when used. It uses the texture of [[oak planks]] on all but one face, on which it has its own [[bookshelf]]-like texture randomized based on its location.

== Obtaining ==
Boxes of infinite books can't be crafted. They naturally generate in the "library" and "isolation" dimensions. They are also available in the [[Creative inventory]].

=== Breaking ===
Boxes of infinite books can be mined by hand, but are broken faster with an [[axe]]. In either case, they drop themselves. Unlike bookshelves, they do not require Silk Touch to obtain.

=== Natural generation ===
Boxes of infinite books naturally generate in the "library" dimension where they make up the bulk of the dimension’s terrain, and in the "isolation" dimension where 10 boxes can be found in the basement of the house.

== Usage ==
When {{ctrl|used}}, if the block is not on one of its chunk's edges and facing along that edge, a random [[written book]] is generated. This book can be thrown into a [[Nether portal]] to create a [[funky portal]].

The random books are tied to the [[block]] such that using the same block multiple times always returns an identical book. The title of the random books given by the block is correlated with the location of the block. The title's pattern takes the format <code><''chunk X''>/<''chunk Z''>/<''block orientation''>/<''distance to the chunk's edge to the right of the block''>/<''block Y''></code>, so books from the same block always has the same title and content.

The author of every book is "Universe itself", obfuscated, and every book has 16 pages filled with random text. No books ever drop if [[game rule]] <code>doTileDrops</code> is set to <code>false</code>.
