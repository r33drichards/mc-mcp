'''Swamp huts''' (also known as '''witch huts''') are small above ground [[structure]]s that have the ability to spawn [[witch]]es and black [[cat]]s.

== Generation ==
Swamp huts generate rarely in [[swamp]] biomes, in the north-west corner of a given [[chunk]]. They do not generate in [[mangrove swamp]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-249932|||WAI}}</ref>

Swamp huts can be located with swamp [[explorer map]]s, which are sold by [[jungle]], [[Snowy Plains|snowy]] and [[taiga]] cartographer [[villager]]s.

== Structure ==
{{main|/Structure}}
[[File:Swamp Hut inside.png|thumb|The inside of a swamp hut with a witch and black cat inside.]]
Swamp huts consist of a small square building made of [[spruce planks]], with [[oak log]] pillars extending down to the ground. There is a small platform outside of the hut that could be an entrance; however, it is several blocks above the ground, and there are no stairs that go up to the hut, although [[vines]] can generate from the front platform and down to the ground. The roof of the swamp hut is made up of [[spruce stairs]] and [[spruce planks]]. The hut is two blocks tall inside.

The inside of a swamp hut consists of a [[cauldron]], a [[crafting table]], and a [[flower pot]] with a [[red mushroom]] in it.

{{IN|Java}}, the cauldron is always empty, while {{in|BE}}, the cauldron generates with 1 to 3 bottles of a random [[potion]] inside. There is a 25% chance for [[Potion of Healing]] or [[Potion of Poison|Poison]], 15% for [[Potion of Swiftness|Swiftness]], 10% for [[Potion of Slowness|Slowness]], [[Potion of Weakness|Weakness]], or [[Potion of Water Breathing|Water Breathing]], and 5% for [[Potion of Fire Resistance|Fire Resistance]].{{citation needed|These percentages seem accurate, but where exactly do they come from?}}

Upon world generation, one [[witch]] and one stray [[Cat|black cat]] spawn inside the hut. These never naturally despawn, however, the witch does not spawn when the [[difficulty]] is set to Peaceful.

Additionally, witches can spawn at any block within the 7×7×9 (x×y×z) area that constitutes the hut (this is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof). Cats can also spawn within this area. However, they require a [[grass block]] to spawn on. {{IN|Java}}, any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from [[spawn egg]]s and [[commands]] without cat type set) always spawn as black.

Both witches and cat wander around independently from each other or the hut, and neither return to the hut on purpose.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, witches respawn on only one block within the swamp hut if the witch is killed. The spawn point is on the hut floor, two blocks in front of the [[crafting table]].

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Swamp hut|Witch hut}}

== Trivia ==
* The "hut" part of a swamp hut generates on or above the surface, while the wood "pillars" extend down until they reach solid ground. This means that if part of a swamp hut is at sea level and another part is on top of deep ground, such as a [[canyon]], the pillars on the deep-ground side go all the way down to the bottom.
* A black cat spawning in a witch hut follows European folklore that {{w|Black cat|associates black cats with witches|newtab=1}}.
