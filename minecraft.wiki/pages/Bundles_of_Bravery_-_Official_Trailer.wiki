'''Bundles of Bravery - Official Trailer''' is a trailer for the [[game drop]] of the [[Bundles of Bravery|same name]], utilizing a mix of cinematic animations and in-game footage.

== Summary ==
[[Ari]] exits out of a tent, and begins to take it apart, beginning with a [[campfire]], followed by [[Wool|white wool]], [[stripped cherry wood]], and [[Wooden Fence|spruce fences]]. All the components of the tent go into a red [[bundle]]. Looking down at an [[Explorer Map|explorer map]], Ari progresses on a quest, seguing into gameplay footage. They go into a [[Snowy village|snowy plains village]], collecting [[Carrot|carrots]] from a farm and opening a [[chest]], before leaving on a [[horse]]. Ari proceeds to trek through many more biomes, before ultimately finding a [[Lush Caves|lush cave]].

Inside the lush cave, Ari collects [[Glow Berries|glow berries]] and [[Raw Iron|raw iron]], before being confronted by a [[zombie]]. Ari continues through more biomes, finding a [[Bee Nest|bee nest]] in a [[meadow]]. Looking down at a magenta bundle, Ari collects a [[Honey Bottle|honey bottle]] from the nest without placing a campfire, angering the [[Bee|bees]]. After fleeing on a horse, Ari makes progress to a site of [[Buried Treasure|buried treasure]], coming across an animated [[dolphin]]. Pulling out a light blue bundle, Ari feeds it [[Raw Salmon|salmon]], before following it using a [[boat]].

In a post-credits scene, Ari returns to the dolphin site with a yellow bundle, presumably having claimed the treasure. It is now night, with several monsters surrounding the [[beach]], though none targeting Ari. Ari starts to place fish on a campfire, before staring at an [[enderman]] in the eyes.

{{Quote|The latest Minecraft Update is really just two features — but each have been several years in the making:

𝐁𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 is the first official game "drop" — a smaller, more frequent content change which Mojang Studios/Microsoft will be leaning into more vs the large, once-a-year updates of yore. And at its core, it features 2 things:

 💔 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞: the die-and-you're-done mode arrives on Bedrock
 👜 𝐁𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬: a new kind of storage item, great for odds-and-ends

What do they have in common? Time. Since the start of Bedrock (2016), players have been asking about Hardcore — but rare bugs which would cause a player's death & end the world complicated it. And Bundles were first seen in 2020 at Minecraft LIVE, but have been a herculean task to figure out across all the different platforms that the game exists on (mobile, console, PC).

Players rarely think about the things platforms are juggling in the background: crossplay, tech debt, etc. But occasionally, some cool features like these rely on them — and it's a great chance to be appreciative of that work.|Ben Sarraille<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ben-sarraille-a71363119_the-latest-minecraft-update-is-really-just-activity-7254528667333050369-DvA9/|title=The latest Minecraft Update is really just two features — but each have been several years in the making:<br><br>𝐁𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 is the first official game "drop" — a smaller, more frequent content change which Mojang Studios/Microsoft will be leaning into more vs the large, once-a-year updates of yore.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Ari returns.jpg|thumb|The screenshot from the video.]]
* Prior to being officially announced, an image of Ari outside the tent was used in an email recapping [[Minecraft Live 2024]].{{Citation needed}}
* An [[ocelot]] appears in a village, seemingly confused for the separate [[cat]] mob.
* Dolphins in the cinematic segments of the trailer have a head separate from their body, a trait previously featured in artwork for the [[Update Aquatic]].
* A screenshot from the trailer is used in an article promoting the update, alongside otherwise wholly original images from the game.<ref>{{Mcnet|bundles-of-bravery|Bundles of Bravery|October 22, 2024|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
* This is the first cinematic to only feature Ari out of the protagonists.
* Initially, the trailer was simply entitled Bundles of Bravery, with no subtitle. At an unknown point, the name was changed.{{Citation needed}}
