A '''bottle o' enchanting''' is an [[item]] that can be thrown to break it and release [[experience orbs]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|bottle-o'-enchanting}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
A bottle o' enchanting can be thrown by pressing {{control|use}}. On impact, it destroys itself and drops [[experience]] orbs worth {{xp|3|11}} (average 7.0) and sends out blue particles. Bottles o' enchanting can be used to increase the player's level for [[enchanting]], using an [[anvil]], or repairing tools and armor enchanted with [[Mending]].

Bottles o' enchanting have an [[enchantment glint]] like enchanted items do.
