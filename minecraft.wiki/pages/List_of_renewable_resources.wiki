<includeonly>=</includeonly>== Vault ==<includeonly>=</includeonly>
Each [[vault]] and [[ominous vault]] keeps track of up to 128 unique [[player]]s that have opened the vault. If a 129th player opens the vault, the first known player who opened the vault is forgotten, and can open the vault again. Resources listed below are renewable '''only''' through this behavior, and not by any other method.
