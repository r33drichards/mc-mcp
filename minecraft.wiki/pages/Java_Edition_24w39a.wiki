'''24w39a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.2]], released on September 25, 2024,<ref>{{snap|24w39a|September 25, 2024}}</ref> which adds bundles to normal gameplay and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>map_invisibility_equipment</code> item tag, for items that can be equipped to hide the player marker on other players maps.
* Added the <code>#boat</code> entity type tag.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Bundle]]s'''
* Are no longer experimental.

'''[[Carved pumpkin]]'''
* Equipping it on the player's head now removes the player marker from other players' maps.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Boat]]s and [[boats with chests]]'''
* The entity IDs for boats and boats with chests have been split into separate types, one per existing variant, instead of {{cd|Type}} field.

=== General ===
'''Container locks'''
* The <code>Lock</code> field of containers has been renamed to <code>lock</code> and is now an item predicate.
** Any items which match the predicate can open the container.
* The <code>lock</code> data component is now also an item predicate.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>55</code>.
* Removed the <code>bundle</code> feature flag and built-in data pack.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Removed the <code>minecraft:boat</code> entity sub-predicate, since boats no longer have variants.

'''[[UI]]'''
* Updated slot highlight so item texture has better visibility.
** The previous textures have been added to Programmer Art resource pack.
