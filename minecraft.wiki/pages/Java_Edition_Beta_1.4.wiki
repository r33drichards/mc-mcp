Beta 1.4 was reuploaded an hour and a half after release to remove debug code.<ref>[https://gist.github.com/Pokechu22/f87c3586fd09b987d1f215fc531c2878 diff_1.4-1_b1.4-2.diff] – Gist</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Missing textures and models|Missing content]]'''
* [[File:Missing Texture JE1.png|32px]] Added the missing texture.
** Used if a texture is absent from the game files.
** Only visible through modding (including removing an image file from the jar).
** Previously the game would just outright crash if a texture was absent.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Red Bed (N) JE1.png|32px]] [[Bed]]'''
* Sleeping in a bed now resets spawn position, though does not work for most users.
** At the moment the spawn point unintentionally only changes if "Leave bed" is clicked and the function is limited to multiplayer.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|54832115665207296|Bed respawn point only works in SMP, and only if you click leave bed.|April 4, 2011}}</ref>

'''[[File:Ladder (S) JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Ladder]]s'''
* Sneaking while climbing hangs on to the [[ladder]].

'''{{animate|Wheat Age 0 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 1 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 2 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 3 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 4 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 5 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 6 JE6 BE1.png; Wheat Age 7 JE6 BE1.png|32px}} [[Wheat Crops]]'''
* Now grows more quickly.

=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Brown Sheep JE1.png; Pink Sheep JE1.png|32px}} [[Sheep]]'''
* Can now spawn with pink or brown [[wool]] (very rarely, however).

'''[[File:Spider JE3 BE2.png|32px]] [[Spider]]s'''
* No longer trample [[crops]].
* Have their walking sounds removed.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Monster Room JE1.png|32px]] [[Monster Room]]'''
* Added [[cocoa beans]] to chests.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Achievement/Java_Edition|Achievement]]s'''
* Lots of infrastructure has been implemented.
** Among these are opening the [[inventory]], mining [[Log|wood]], and building a [[crafting table]].

'''[[Control]]s'''
* The new default hotkey for the [[inventory]] is {{key|E}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* Servers can now have a new world seeded with an option in the server.properties file.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Scale of UI may now be changed in <code>options.txt</code> located in the <code>.minecraft</code> folder.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Lots of infrastructure for statistics lists have been implemented.

'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Changed ''Minecraft'' logo from [[File:Java Edition logo 6.png|x20px]] to [[File:Java Edition logo 7.png|x20px]].

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* [[Zombie]]s and [[spider]]s now hurt the player in all instances.
** Before this version, [[zombie]]s and [[spider]]s only hurt the player if they were 1 block above their location.{{more info|who was above who's location?}}
* Client-sided [[slime]] spawn on [[multiplayer]] has been fixed.
* Arm no longer swings when player cannot place a block.
* Opening and closing the [[inventory]] quickly while swinging no longer removes the character 'swinging' animation, which previously made destroying blocks faster. (Multiplayer only).

== Reupload ==
Beta 1.4 was reuploaded around an hour and a half after its initial release. The later version removed a small unused section of code added in the initial version which tracks the player's walking distance in memory, presumably testing code accidentally left in the game for [[Beta 1.5]], which added [[statistics]] – namely, a statistic that tracks how many meters the player has walked.
