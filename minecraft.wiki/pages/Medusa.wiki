'''Medusa''' is a mythological character, known for her ability to turn any who stare at her to [[stone]].

== Appearance ==
In ''Minecraft Mini-Series'', She appears as a large, swamp-green [[slime]] with snake-like hair. Due to being based off a slime initially, Medusa in the series is presented as much larger than slimes, around twice the size of [[Quinn]]. Curiously, the show also makes the actual head subtly transparent, making it more closely resemble a slime.

== Powers and abilities ==
Medusa's most notable ability is to petrify anyone who stares into her eyes.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.getty.edu/education/kids_families/do_at_home/artscoops/defeat_medusa.html|title=The Defeat of Medusa|website=Education at the Getty}}</ref> According to Quinn in Mini-Series, however, she merely causes people to "get stuck in stone." In the context of the episode, this is represented by the characters by looking into her eyes stepping on a [[Stone Pressure Plate|stone pressure plate]], causing [[Stone Bricks|stone bricks]] to rise up around them.<ref>{{YouTube link|6QkHmP24UQ|Medusa's Cave {{!}} Minecraft Mini Series: Season 2 {{!}} Episode 2|Mattel Action|March 29, 2018}}</ref> Medusa is also represented mimicking certain abilities of slimes, jumping from a great distance with no injury.

== Biography ==
Medusa is a classic figure in {{Wikipedia|Greek mythology}}, the only mortal of three {{Wikipedia|gorgon}} sisters. She would be considered the most beautiful of the trinity, being mentioned the most of her sisters in ancient texts. Within Greek canon, she would meet her fate at the hands of {{Wikipedia|Perseus}}, who managed to decapitate her and used her head as a weapon for many years.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Medusa/|title=Medusa|author=Kelly Macquire|website=World History Encyclopedia|date=June 14, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Medusa-Greek-mythology|title=Medusa|website=Britannica}}</ref>

At some point, she would join under the allegiance of a man calling himself Zeus, who entrusted her with one of the [[enchanted eyes of ender]].<ref>{{YouTube link|2oXLUzjFAdE|The Kraken Attacks! {{!}} Minecraft Mini Series: Season 2 {{!}} Episode 7|Mattel Action|May 3, 2018}}</ref> To do so, she kept the artifact buried within her [[Medusa's Cave|personal cave]] on an island, keeping it secure for several years. During a crisis wherein Poseidon took over a reality television series, multiple figures would wash ashore the island and investigate the cave, looking for the first eye. Medusa would manage to defeat [[Zed]] and [[Durango]] with minimal effort, but ended up bested by [[CommuniKate]]. Using a vanity mirror she had on hand, she would activate one of her own traps, containing the threat for an uncertain amount of time.

== Trivia ==
* Due to the later confirmation that [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] are not real deities, it is possible that the Medusa featured in ''Mini-Series'' is another creature or person fascinated with the legend. This would explain why Medusa cannot literally petrify anyone in that series, though it does raise the question of why staring at a mirror would frighten her.
* Medusa's name is derived from an ancient Greek word, μέδω, meaning "she who rules/protects."<ref>{{Citation|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%9C%CE%AD%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B1|title=Μέδουσα|website=Wikitonary}}</ref> On top of the historical and mythological significance, this works with Medusa being consistently portrayed as guarding treasure in ''Minecraft''.
