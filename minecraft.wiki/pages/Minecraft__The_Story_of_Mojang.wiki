== Kickstarter page and pledges ==

2 Player Productions accepted pledges from people over the web through a service called [http://www.kickstarter.com Kickstarter]. These pledges were the money that 2 Player Productions used to fund the movie. 2 Player Productions stopped accepting pledges on Saturday, Mar 26, 2:49 am EDT. In the end, they got exactly $210,297, more than 140% of the $150,000 goal. There were only 3,631 backers, meaning that the average pledge was around $58. All backers earned rewards. The type of reward corresponded with the amount of money pledged (pledging more money meant getting a bigger reward). On March 9, 2011, 2 Player Production reached their goal by exceeding $150,000. The day after, some people unbacked, meaning they get their money back and the total amount of money earned dropped to $145,000. After that, the amount gradually grew, taking a leap on the last day, when last-minute backers pledged. 2 Player Productions posted a long backer-only update thanking everyone.
