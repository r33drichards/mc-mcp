A '''corruption''' is a lush biome, added in [[24w14potato]]. It generates in the [[Potato dimension]].

== Description ==
Corruption is a forested biome. Only [[potato tree]]s generate here, in all three variants, although larger trees generate more rarely. Corruption resembles a normal [[forest]] biome more than [[arboretum]]: trees generate separated from each other and foliage color is uniform.

Surface of corruption is covered with [[corrupted peelgrass block]]s. [[Short Grass|Short]] and [[tall grass]], as well as [[potato flower]]s, [[potato sprouts]] and [[potato]] plants grow on top of it. [[Potato bud]]s can be seen between the trees, slowly growing upward.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:

}}

Phantoms in corruption can spawn in the daylight and they don't burn. Witches can spawn in the daylight as well.

Besides mentioned mobs, [[bee]]s are common as well, due to potato trees generating many [[bee nest]]s.

== Sounds ==
=== Music ===
Like the [[warped forest]], the corruption has no music.
