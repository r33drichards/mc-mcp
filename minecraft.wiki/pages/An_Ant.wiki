'''An ant''' is a joke [[block]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]] that moves around when placed on top of black or white [[concrete]].

== Obtaining ==
An ant cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. An ant can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}}, and naturally generates in the "[[Java Edition 20w14∞|ant]]" dimension. It cannot be [[Breaking|mined]] or [[Explosion|exploded]].

=== Natural generation ===
A single ant naturally generates in the "ant" dimension, where it begins moving immediately.

== Usage ==
An ant simulates {{w|Langton's ant}}. If placed on top of black or white [[concrete]], it moves in a deterministic pattern, turning the concrete underneath it into its other variation. The ant block is the Turing machine mentioned in the update's [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/every-update-imaginable-coming-minecraft changelog].

If two ant blocks collide, they merge into a single block. It cannot be pushed by pistons, and can replace bedrock. If the concrete beneath it is broken, then it stops moving. If a block is in its way, it either pushes the block or destroys it.
