=== World generation ===
'''[[Deepslate]]'''
* Now the gradual transition from stone starts at height between Y=0 to Y=8, rather than Y=-8 to Y=0 previously.

=== General ===

* If it is started from an external source, the JFR events for network packets are now aggregated instead of one event per packet.

'''Simulation distance'''
* Blocks and fluids are now also affected.
* Increased the lower limit for simulation distance from 2 chunks to 5 chunks.

'''General'''
* Optimized entity collisions.
