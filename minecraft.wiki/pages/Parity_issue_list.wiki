[[File:Zombie Villager with Golden Difference.png|thumb|Example of a parity issue.]]
This page is a list of parity issues between {{editions|je|be}}. A parity issue is where one feature exists only in one edition of the game and not in the other (version exclusives), or the behavior of a feature differs between both editions.

Suggestions to fix existing parity issues prior to the [[Buzzy Bees]] update ({{edition|je}} 1.15, {{edition|be}} 1.14.0) should be made on [https://feedback.minecraft.net the feedback site] or [https://discord.com/channels/1138536747932864532/1138683774071214170 the feedback Discord].<ref group="note">
There is a new policy about accepting certain parity issues in the [https://bugs.mojang.com/ bug tracker]; this was not in effect until late April 2020. A parity issue can be reported in the bug tracker if '''all''' of these following criteria are met:
* It is present both in {{editions|java|bedrock}}.
* It behaves differently across editions.
* It was introduced or explicitly changed in [[Buzzy Bees]] or later.
See [https://www.reddit.com/r/Mojira/comments/g9rjfh/from_now_on_well_accept_bug_reports_about_certain this post] by a moderator on the Mojira subreddit for more details.

== Note ==
Snapshot/beta features are listed only with {{tl|Upcoming}} templates. Use the {{tl|Until}} or {{tl|Upcoming}} templates where applicable. Entries are not to be removed unless the changes came into the final release of the corresponding edition.
<!-- 
Do NOT use the <sup> tags used below, use the {{Until}} or {{Upcoming}} templates as stated above
-->
* In the section "In ''Bedrock Edition'' but not in ''Java Edition''", <sup>[''until [[Bedrock Edition version history|BE (version number)]]'']</sup> or <sup>[''upcoming: [[Java Edition version history|JE (version number)]]'']</sup> means it is no longer the case and fixed in the provided version; and <sup>[''until [[Java Edition version history|JE (version number)]]'']</sup> or <sup>[''upcoming: [[Bedrock Edition version history|BE (version number)]]'']</sup> means that it was in parity before, and no longer is starting from that version.

* Grindstone, loom, smithing table, stonecutter, villager and wandering trader GUIs are different between editions.{{info needed|Comparison images}}
* In ''Bedrock'', hearts move down when having regeneration, while they move up in ''Java''.
*Usernames in ''Java'' can be 3–16 characters long, while usernames in ''Bedrock'' can be 3–32 characters long (without signing in).<ref group="note">However, if signed in with a Microsoft account on ''Bedrock Edition'', the username can only be up to 12 characters long.</ref>
* Loading screen looks different between editions (both for menu, and loading up a world).
* The [[panorama]] moves left in ''Bedrock Edition'', and right in ''Java Edition''.<ref>{{Bug|MCPE-229841|3=Panorama no longer rotates clockwise}}</ref>
* Random tick speed gamerule defaults to 1 in BE and 3 in JE.
* Swinging animations are different between editions.{{info needed|Comparison gif}}
* The distribution of resource packs on servers is handled differently: in JE, a link to a downloadable file is required in the [[server.properties]]; in BE, it is included in the world files. This also affects Realms, where on BE you can add your own RP to the realm. In JE, this feature is restricted to the maps in the map creators program.
* Default field of view is 70 degrees in ''Java Edition'' and 60 degrees in ''Bedrock Edition''.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-167158}}</ref>

[[File:Bedrock Nether Structure Generation.png|thumb|''Bedrock Edition'' nether structure distribution.]]
* Different [[chest loot]] between editions.<ref group="note">See also [[User:PancakeIdentity/LootDiff|this user list]] for more thorough explanations.</ref>
** The bastion remnant loot tables in ''Bedrock'' do not contain spectral arrows (as they have not been implemented).

* Different generated structure, terrain feature and cave carver locations between editions.<ref name=jungletemple/><ref>{{bug|MCPE-154323}}</ref>
* In ''Java'', nether biome particles are generated within the respective biomes. In ''Bedrock'', particles appear everywhere, even outside of the biomes, but are visible only when inside of the biome, at which point they can be seen everywhere. Given their rendering behavior at extreme distances it appears as though they are rendered in much the same way as rain and snow.
* The ash particles in [[Basalt Deltas]] move randomly in ''Bedrock'', but move northwest in ''Java''.<ref>{{bug|MC-196142}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-68992}}</ref>
* [[Buried treasure]] chests always generate at chunk coordinate 8 (out of 0 through 15) on both the X and Z axis in ''Bedrock'', and at chunk coordinates 9 on ''Java''<ref>{{bug|MC-227443}}</ref>.
* The game splits the Nether into regions in which one of either a [[nether fortress]] or a [[bastion remnant]] can generate. The regions are 432×432 blocks in ''Java Edition'' and 480×480 blocks in ''Bedrock Edition''.
* In ''Java Edition'', the chance of a fortress generating instead of a bastion is 2⁄5 (40%), while in ''Bedrock Edition'' the chance of a fortress generating instead of a bastion is 1⁄3 (33.3%)
* Colors pattern of [[eroded badlands]] aren't the same between ''Java'' and ''Bedrock Edition''.<ref>{{bug|MC-240977}}</ref>
* Different extreme distance effects in each edition. See [[Java Edition distance effects]] and [[Bedrock Edition distance effects]] for more information.

* In ''Java Edition'', [[magma block]]s in the nether attempt to generate 4 times per chunk in sizes of 0–160, from altitudes Y=27 to Y=36 in all biomes. It can only replace netherrack. In ''Bedrock Edition'', it attempts to generate 9 times per chunk in sizes of 0–106, from altitudes Y=23 to Y=36 in all biomes. It can replace netherrack and blackstone.

* Different [[Anvil/Mechanics#Costs for combining enchantments|anvil XP costs]] between editions.
** In ''Java'', costs are scaled using the final level of the enchantment being added. In ''Bedrock Edition'', costs are scaled using the final level minus the initial level. For example, combining two Sharpness IV books into a Sharpness V book costs 5 levels on ''Java'', but 1 level on Bedrock.
* Renaming on an [[anvil]] has a maximum of 50 characters long on JE and 30 characters long on BE.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-127906}}</ref>
* [[Nether portal block]]s in the End teleport players to the Nether in ''Java'' and the Overworld in ''Bedrock''. In ''Bedrock'', End portal blocks in the Nether teleport players to the End. The behavior of end portal blocks in the Nether in ''Java'' is unknown.{{verify}}
* Smelting [[cacti]] yields more experience in JE ({{experience|2}}) than BE ({{experience|0.2}}).<ref>{{bug|MC-210211}}</ref>
* Text colors glows differently on signs when using [[glow ink sac]]s. In ''Java'', the colors are brighter but not accurate to the palette<ref>{{bug|MC-227311}}</ref>, while in ''Bedrock'', the text outline are too dark.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-129757}}</ref>
* In the ''Java Edition'' [[chest]] interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half.

* Different villager [[trading]] between editions.
**'''General'''
*** ''Bedrock'' trade groups are based on the specific trade slot. ''Java'' trade groups are based on the villager level. This affects the chances of trades that are chosen. For example, ''Bedrock'' farmers always sell bread, while ''Java'' farmers have a 40% chance to sell bread (20% per slot, 2 slots). For simplicity's sake, these groups aren't listed as they still respect the levels.
** '''Butcher'''
*** The emeralds for coal trade give the villager 2 XP in ''Java'' and 10 XP in ''Bedrock''.
** '''Cartographer'''
*** The banner for emeralds trade isn't "grouped" with itself in ''Java''. See the below point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this.
** '''Farmer'''
*** The suspicious stew trade isn't "grouped" with itself in ''Java''. This affects the chances of offering the trade. In Bedrock, the chance of offering the suspicious stew is {{fraction|1|3}} for a single slot. In ''Java'', it's {{fraction|6|7}}, as all 6 suspicious stew types are listed as separate trades.
** '''Fletcher'''
*** The emeralds and arrows for tipped arrows trade may give Arrows of Decay (currently not in ''Java'') in ''Bedrock'', while it may give Arrows of Slow Falling in ''Java''.
** '''Leatherworker'''
*** The Journeyman level emeralds for dyed leather tunic trades rewards the villager 10 XP in ''Bedrock'' while it rewards 1 XP in ''Java''.
** '''Mason'''
*** The granite/diorite/andesite for emeralds trade is not "grouped" in ''Java''. See the above point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this. 
*** The emeralds for polished granite/polished diorite/polished andesite trade is not "grouped" in ''Java''. See the above point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this. 
*** The emeralds for terracotta and glazed terracotta trades are not "grouped" in ''Java'', while they are all in one big group in Bedrock. See the above point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this. This one is especially bad as the quartz trade 6.25% chance of appearing.
*** The emeralds for quartz blocks/pillars trades are not "grouped" in ''Java''. See the above point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this. In this specific case, this means that ''Java'' always offers both trades while ''Bedrock'' always offers only one. See the above point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this.
** '''Shepherd'''
*** None of the colored item or dye trades are "grouped" in ''Java''. See the above point about the farmer's suspicious stew trade for an explanation of this.
** '''Weaponsmith'''
*** The enchanted iron sword trade has a price multiplier of 0.05 and a villager XP reward of 1 in ''Java'', while it has a price multiplier of 0.2 and a villager XP reward of 5 in ''Bedrock''.
*** The emeralds for bells trade is offered by apprentice weaponsmith villagers in ''Java'', while it is offered by journeyman weaponsmith villagers in ''Bedrock''.
*** Said bell trade has a villager XP reward of 5 in ''Java'', while it has a villager XP reward of 10 in ''Bedrock''.
* Different wandering trader [[trading]] between editions.
** ''Bedrock'' has trade grouping that prevents items of similar types from being offered more than once per trader. 
*** All dyes are grouped (1 for 3, 12 uses), all seeds are grouped (1 for 1, 12 uses), both mushrooms are grouped (1 for 1, 12 uses), all coral blocks are grouped (3 for 1, 8 uses), and all saplings are grouped (5 for 1, 8 uses).
* In ''Java'', entity shadows are more smoothly rounded than on ''Bedrock''.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-32662}}</ref>
* [[Fox]]es behave differently across editions.
** Have different chances of holding eggs (15%{{only|java|short=1}}/20%{{only|be|short=1}}) or feathers (20%{{only|java|short=1}}/15%{{only|be|short=1}}) when spawned.
** In ''Bedrock'', they always drop the item they spawn with when killed; in ''Java'', they have an 8.5% chance of doing so.
** When killed, adult foxes drop {{experience|1|2}} in ''Java'' and {{experience|1|3}} in ''Bedrock''.
* [[Drowned]] equipment spawn rates differ.
** Have a 3.75% chance to spawn with a fishing rod in JE{{upcoming|BE 26.0}}, as opposed to 0.85% in BE.{{until|BE 26.0}}
** Have a 6.25% chance to spawn with a trident in JE{{upcoming|BE 26.0}}, as opposed to 15% in BE.{{until|BE 26.0}}
** Have a 3% chance to spawn with a nautilus shell in its offhand in JE, as opposed to 8% in BE.
* In ''Java Edition'', each cartographer sells its own unique explorer map that points to a different location than other cartographers. Purchasing another explorer map from the same cartographer results in the same explorer map. In ''Bedrock Edition'', a cartographer sells explorer maps that point to the nearest unexplored location, regardless of whether it has been previously mapped by another cartographer. After a player explores the location, the cartographer sells a new map.
* In ''Java Edition'', the movement of a mount is controlled by its passenger, if both the mount and the passenger are mobs (not players). In ''Bedrock Edition'', for most of rideable mobs, when its mob passenger tries to chase and attack player or mobs, the passenger takes control, otherwise the mount controls movement.
* In ''Java Edition'' feeding baby animals reduces the time remaining until they grow up by 10%. In ''Bedrock Edition'' feeding baby animals reduces the total amount of time until they grow up by 10%, meaning feeding a baby animal 10 times in a row will cause them to immediately become an adult.
* Most entities have different hitbox sizes in each edition.

=== Commands ===
* Color code <code>§6</code>, <code>gold</code>, has shadow color <code>2A2A00</code> in ''Java'' and <code>402A00</code> in ''Bedrock''.
* Commands that provide block states is written <code>[key=value,key=value]</code> in ''Java'', and <code>["key"="value","key"="value"]</code> in ''Bedrock''.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-170849}}</ref>
* Completely different {{command|tellraw}} syntax between editions, existence of {{command|titleraw}} {{in|bedrock}}, etc.
* ''Java'' has {{command|forceload}}, while ''Bedrock'' has {{command|tickingarea}}.

=== Sounds ===
* Different sound volume levels between editions.
* The file names for [[music]] tracks by [[C418]] differ. On ''Java'', tracks use their title from the soundtrack, but on ''Bedrock'', tracks use a generic name (e.g. "subwoofer_lullaby.ogg" on ''Java'', "hal1.ogg" on ''Bedrock'')
* Menu music stops playing in ''Java Edition'' when the player leaves the main menu and stops playing in ''Bedrock Edition'' when a loading screen finishes.
* Some music tracks play in different biomes in different editions.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-182285}}</ref>

=== Textures, models and animations ===
{{more images|
* Sunflowers: the back and front are one element in ''Java Edition'' but rendered as two completely separate planes in ''Bedrock Edition'', both of which can be seen from the front. ''Java Edition'' is also affected by {{bug|MC-122701}}.
* Cross models: the pixels are more square shaped on ''Bedrock Edition'', and the back faces are more realistically mirrored (although this results in cases of ugly unrealistic mirror symmetry).
* Other plane models
* ''Bedrock Edition'' fancy pale oak leaves
* ''Bedrock Edition'' short seagrass animated render
* Up to date ''Bedrock Edition'' redstone comparator and repeater renders showing incorrect redstone torch models
* Re-rendered ''Bedrock Edition'' pillager renders showing incorrect limb textures
* Re-rendered ''Bedrock Edition'' cauldron renders with correct lighting
* ''Bedrock Edition'' copper bar models
