A '''wooden shovel''' is an early-game variant of [[shovel]] that is crafted from [[planks]]. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the seventh-highest [[tier]] of shovel, having the lowest [[mining efficiency]], and having the lowest [[attack damage]] alongside [[golden shovel]]s. It can be used as [[fuel]] in a [[furnace]], [[smoker]], or [[blast furnace]].

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

A wooden shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[wooden plank]]s, with each plank restoring 14{{only|JE|short=1}} or 15{{only|BE|short=1}} durability (25% of its maximum durability, rounded down). Two wooden shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A wooden shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
