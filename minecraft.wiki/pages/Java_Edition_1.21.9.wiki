}}
* The shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
** Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot.
** The shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an item frame.
* Items in the shelf will render in the middle of the shelf.
* While a shelf is powered by redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered shelves will connect.
** Interacting with a single powered shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar.
** Interacting with two connected shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar.
** Interacting with three connected shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar.
** It does not matter which of the connected shelves the player interacts with.
** Powered shelves can only connect to other powered shelves facing the exact same direction.
* They provide a signal value to [[redstone comparator]]s placed at the back: the strength of the signal is a binary number based on the filling state of the slot, with the left slot being the least significant bit and the right slot being the most significant bit.

=== Items ===

=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Copper Golem BE1.png;Exposed Copper Golem BE1.png;Weathered Copper Golem BE1.png;Oxidized Copper Golem BE1.png|32px}} [[Copper golem]]'''
* A new mob which can be spawned by placing a [[jack o'lantern]] or [[carved pumpkin]] on top of a [[copper block]].
* Has {{hp|12}} health points.
* Drops 1 to 3 [[copper ingot]]s when killed.
* They are immune to fall damage, and do not drown underwater.
* Copper golems oxidize over time and can be waxed like copper blocks.
** Lightning bolts clean oxidation off copper golems.
* Copper golems take on the oxidization state of the [[copper block]] used to make them.
* If the copper golem has fully oxidized and is not waxed, it will turn into a [[copper golem statue]] block.
** When turned into a copper golem statue, the copper golem will drop any item it may be holding.
** A copper golem turned into a copper golem statue will keep its name if named with a [[name tag]].
* Copper golems can help with sorting items into [[chest]]s.
* If it is not holding an item, it will look for a nearby [[copper chest]] and pick up items from that chest.
** The copper golem will look in any oxidized and waxed copper chest variant to pick up items.
** It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time.
** Any item in a copper chest can be picked up.
* Interacting with the copper golem with an empty hand will make it drop its carried item.
* If it is holding an item, it will look for nearby wooden [[chest]]s to try to place the item into.
** The copper golem will look in chests and trapped chests to try to place items.
** It can only place an item in a chest if the chest is empty or contains the same type, name and enchantments of item the golem is holding in its hand.
* It will visit a max of 10 copper chests when looking for items to pick up, and a max of 10 chests when looking for somewhere to put the items.
* If no matching chest is found, the copper golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again.
* The search area for chests from the copper golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks.
* Decorative flowers can be planted on them by [[iron golem]]s.
** These flowers can be removed with [[shears]].
** Drop upon turning into a [[copper golem statue|statue]].
* Copper golems are able to open [[door]]s.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[File:Alex (slim) JE2.png|50px]] [[Mannequin]]'''
* Added a new type of technical entity called <code>minecraft:mannequin</code> which can only be spawned with summon commands.
** A mannequin is a player avatar without a connected player.
** Mannequins function as living entities, like [[armor stand]]s.
*** They can hold and wear equipment, have attributes & effects, take damage, etc.
** Mannequins' description text can be configured.
** They accept {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component from spawner items.
** Data Fields:
*** <code>profile</code> - Which profile to show on the entity. This is a Player profile (same format as a <code>minecraft:profile</code> component, which has been extended to allow overrides).
**** Defaults to <code>{}</code> (i.e. static profile with both {{cd|id}} and {{cd|name}} missing).
*** <code>hidden_layers</code> - List of outer skin layers to hide.
**** Valid entries: <code>cape</code>, <code>jacket</code>, <code>left_sleeve</code>, <code>right_sleeve</code>, <code>left_pants_leg</code>, <code>right_pants_leg</code>, <code>hat</code>.
*** <code>main_hand</code> - Which hand is the main hand of the mannequin.
**** One of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>.
*** {{cd|pose}} - The pose of the mannequin.
**** Valid entries: {{cd|standing}}, {{cd|crouching}}, {{cd|swimming}}, {{cd|fall_flying}}, {{cd|sleeping}}.
*** {{cd|immovable}} - Optional boolean specifying that the mannequin cannot be moved (defaults to {{cd|false}}).
*** {{cd|description}} - Optional text component shown where a player's {{cd|below_score}} score would show.
**** The default "NPC" ({{cd|entity.minecraft.mannequin.label}}) text is shown if omitted.
*** {{cd|hide_description}} - Optional boolean specifying that no description should be shown at all.
**** A mannequin with the description hidden displays as if a player had no {{cd|below_score}} display.
** This entity highly resembles the [[Mob (entity)|Mob]] entity removed long ago in [[Java Edition Beta 1.2|Beta 1.2]], as it is has a player skin and has no movement AI.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|fetchprofile}}'''
* New command that fetches the contents of a player profile from ''Minecraft'' servers.
* Since the operation might take some time, it works asynchronously.
** Results will be printed only when operation finishes, but the game will keep running unpaused.
* After successful completion, a message will be printed that lets users copy the contents of a fully resolved {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component or {{cmd|give @s minecraft:player_head}} with said component.
** It also prints a clickable text to summon a [[mannequin]] with the resolved profile.
* Since the result is not known at the time of execution, this command always returns {{cd|1}}.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|fetchprofile name <player name>}}: resolves profile by username (case-insensitive).
** {{cmd|fetchprofile id <uuid>}}: resolves profile by UUID.

=== General ===
'''[[Chat draft]]s'''
* Unsent chat messages now get saved as chat drafts if the chat was forcibly closed.
** This includes it being closed by external sources such as dying or a dialog opening, but not the player intentionally closing their chat.
* Any existing chat draft will get pre-filled into the message box the next time the chat is opened.
* Draft text has a grayed-out appearance until fully restored.
** Draft text can be restored as regular text by interacting with it:
*** Typing additional text.
*** Moving the text cursor using the arrow keys.
*** Clicking it.
*** Highlighting it.
** Pressing {{key|enter}} on a chat draft prior to it being restored sends it like a normal chat message.
** Pressing {{key|backspace}} on a chat draft prior to it being restored deletes it.

'''[[End flash]]'''
* [[The End]] dimension now has skylight.
* Normally the skylight does not affect how the dimension looks.
* Every 30 seconds, flashes in the sky happen.
* When they happen, skylight intensity increases flooding the dimension with purple light.
* While the ender dragon fog effect is active, the flash source in the sky is not visible and the brightness of the light affecting the world is reduced.
* Last between 5 and 19 seconds.

'''[[Game rule]]s'''
* Added <code>allowEnteringNetherUsingPortals</code> game rule controlling if [[the Nether]] can be entered through portals.
** Defaults to <code>true</code>.
* Added <code>commandBlocksEnabled</code> game rule controlling if [[command block]]s should be enabled or not.
** Defaults to <code>true</code>.
* Added <code>pvp</code> game rule controlling whether players can deal damage to other players.
** Defaults to <code>true</code>.

** Default to <code>true</code>.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added {{w|Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Halychian}} language support.

'''[[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]]'''
* Added a server management API (JSON-RPC over WebSocket) for dedicated servers.
** The API is disabled by default and can be enabled in the server properties file.
*** <code>management-server-enabled=true</code>
*** <code>management-server-host=localhost</code>
*** <code>management-server-port=25585</code>
** The API is accessible at <code>ws://<management-server-host>:<management-server-port></code> when enabled.
** Supports querying and updating of server state (players, allowlist, operators, settings, game rules).
** Sends notifications on state changes (e.g. player joins, game rule updates).
** Calling <code>{"id":1,"method":"rpc.discover"}</code> returns an API schema containing supported methods and notifications of the currently running server.
** The Data Generator produces an API schema (<code>json-rpc-api-schema.json</code>) in the reports output folder mirroring the contents returned by the <code>rpc.discover</code> method.
** The API adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.
** Uses namespaced methods and the reserved namespaces are <code>minecraft</code> (e.g. <code>minecraft:players</code>, <code>minecraft:allowlist/add</code>) and notification (e.g. <code>notification/players/joined</code>).
*** Extensible via custom namespaces for additional methods and events.
** Core method groups: players, allowlist, operators, server (save, stop), server settings, game rules.
** Example method call:
*** Request: <code>{"method":"minecraft:allowlist/add","id":1,"params":[[{"name":"jeb_"}]]}</code>
*** Response: <code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":[{"id":"853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6","name":"jeb_"}]}</code>
** Example notification:
*** <code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notification/players/joined","params":[{"id":"853c80ef-3c37-49fd-aa49-938b674adae6","name":"jeb_"}]}</code>
** Example error:
*** Request: <code>{"method": "minecraft:foo/bar","id": 1}</code>
*** Response: <code>{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32601,"message":"Method not found","data":"Method not found: minecraft:foo/bar"}}}</code>
*** Errors and error codes follow JSON-RPC 2.0 error object format.
* Clients must authenticate to access the API.
** Clients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server specific secret.
** The secret is configured in the server properties file:
*** <code>management-server-secret=</code>
*** The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
*** The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty.
*** Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized.
* TLS is enabled by default.
** Can be disabled in the server properties file:
*** <code>management-server-tls-enabled=false</code>
** Requires a keystore file to be set in the server properties file.
*** <code>management-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12</code>
** The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format.
** Keystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority.0
*** Environment variable: <code>MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD</code>
*** JVM argument: <code>-Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password=</code>
*** Server property: <code>management-server-tls-keystore-password=</code>

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Invert Mouse X" option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis.
* Added "Sprint Window" option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint.
* Added an option to the Chat Settings menu that enables saving unsent chat messages by default.
** With this option enabled, unsent messages will always get saved as chat drafts, even if the player intentionally closed their chat.
* Added "Allow Cursor Changes" option in "Mouse Settings" menu.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added {{cd|copper_fire_flame}}.

[[File:MC25w34a-CodeOfConductScreen.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Minecraft: Java Edition 25w34a. There is a dialog with the caption "Server Code of Conduct".

* The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value.
* The "Voice/Speech" sound source has been renamed to "Narrator/Voice".
* Added new sound events: {{cd|block.copper_chest.open}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest.close}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_weathered.open}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_weathered.close}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_oxidized.open}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_oxidized.close}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.step}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.hurt}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.death}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.spin}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.step}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.hurt}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.death}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.spin}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.step}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.hurt}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.death}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.spin}}, {{cd|item.armor.equip_copper}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.spawn}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.no_item_get}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.no_item_not_get}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.item_drop}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.item_no_drop}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_become_statue}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.break}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.place}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.hit}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.fall}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.step}}, {{cd|block.shelf.activate}}, {{cd|block.shelf.deactivate}}, {{cd|block.shelf.multi_swap}}, {{cd|block.shelf.place_item}}, {{cd|block.shelf.single_swap}}, {{cd|weather.end_flash}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]'''
* <code>run_command</code> click event
** Previously, if the command field contained a command that required a signed message ({{cmd|say}}, {{cmd|me}}, {{cmd|msg}}, {{cmd|tell}}, {{cmd|w}}, {{cmd|teammsg}}, {{cmd|tm}}), it would be silently discarded.
*** Instead, a screen will be shown that lets the user insert the command into the chat window or copy the command to their clipboard if the chat window can't be opened.

'''[[Block entity data]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:skull}}
** The {{cd|profile}} field has been changed to match {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component.
*** That means that it also becomes immutable and is resolved only when necessary.

'''[[Chat]]'''
* It is now possible to start chatting while standing inside a [[Nether portal]].
* The chat will now remain open and unchanged if the player was chatting before being transferred to another dimension.

'''[[Chunks]]'''
* The concept of fixed "spawn chunks" has been removed.
* A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or ender pearls in flight will be considered "active" and will keep processing chunks and entities.
** Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded.
* The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were:
** Chunks loaded by the {{cmd|forceload}} command.
** Chunks active due to portal activity.
** Thrown ender pearls (Singleplayer only).
** The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only).
** Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only).

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* {{cd|blocks_attacks}} item component.
** If the damage reduced in an attack is {{cd|0}}, for example by angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking.

* <code>minecraft:profile</code>
** Player profiles in data components and block entities no longer resolve automatically.
** Previously contents of this component would permanently change when profile was resolved, i.e. downloaded from Minecraft service.
** To avoid issues with this unexpected change, the resolved value is no longer stored and contents of the profile will always remain unchanged.
** This component has now two behaviors:
*** Static: when it has <code>properties</code> field or when both <code>name</code> and <code>id</code> are present or when both are missing.
**** In this state, profile will always render as-is.
**** If <code>properties</code> field is missing, a default skin will be used (selected based on <code>id</code>, same as in offline mode).
**** That means skin will be frozen at the moment of component creation.
**** This option is preferred for decorational uses.
*** Dynamic: when it has either <code>name</code> or <code>id</code> (but not both).
**** When an item containing this profile is rendered on the client side, the profile will be resolved to most recent value.
**** This means that this item will always render with current skin of targeted player.
***** If a player changes skin while game is running, change will not be visible unless clients restart.
**** Resolution might happen with a delay, during which item will render with a default skin.
**** Profile name will replace item name only when it's present.
***** Items with just <code>id</code> will show default name.
**** Items will dynamic profiles be distinguished from static ones with label in tooltip.
** Items stack based on exact contents, so even if a dynamic component is eventually resolved to the same profile as a static one, they won't stack together.
** Player heads in older maps that have not been loaded in never versions yet will usually be converted to dynamic contents.
** Profiles can now also have additional fields that can replace various values used for rendering.
** If any of the fields are omitted, the value from the resolved profile is used, even if the profile resolved to the default skin.
** New fields:
*** {{cd|texture}} - Optional namespaced ID of the skin texture to use for rendering.
**** The skin is specified relative to the {{cd|textures}} folder and with a {{samp|.png}} suffix.
**** e.g. {{cd|entity/player/wide/steve}} will use the default wide Steve skin.
*** {{cd|cape}} - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use for rendering.
**** When specified, uses the same format as the {{cd|texture}} field.
*** {{cd|elytra}} - Optional namespaced ID of the [[elytra]] texture to use for rendering.
**** When specified, uses the same format as the {{cd|texture}} field.
**** If this value is not present either as override or in player profile, mannequins using this profile will use the cape texture, or if that is also not present, the default elytra texture when wearing elytra.
*** {{cd|model}} - Optional model type, one of {{cd|wide}} and {{cd|slim}}.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|88.0}}.
* Renamed <code>chain</code> to <code>iron_chain</code>.

'''[[Debug property|Debug features]]'''
* Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players.
* Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties:
** First, a global debug flag must be enabled with {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED}} or {{cd|1=-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true}}.
** Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN}} or {{cd|1=-DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true}}.
** To get the list of all available debug properties, add {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES}}.
* Warning: this is debug code. It must be handled with extreme care.
** This is an advanced feature, meant to help modders - it should not be used for normal play.
** Features not guaranteed to work as intended.
** It might crash the player's game or corrupt their worlds.
** Individual options might be added, changed or removed without a notice.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable.
* It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world.
** It now displays less information by default.
* Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing {{Key|F3 + F6}}.
** It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed.
** For each item the player can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed.
** Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen.
** Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen.
** The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game.
** The debug options screen has the following preset profiles:
*** {{cd|Default}} resets everything to the default state.
*** {{cd|Performance}} shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen.

'''[[Density function]]'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:find_top_surface}}
** Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function.
** It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive.
*** The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance.
*** The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|density}} - density function to approximate the surface of.
*** {{cd|upper_bound}} - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value.
*** {{cd|lower_bound}} - integer, lowest possible y-value.
*** {{cd|cell_height}} - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:invert}}
** Resolves to {{cd|1/argument}}
** Fields:
*** {{cd|argument}} - density function.

'''[[Enchantment definition]]'''
* {{cd|explode}} entity effects
** New field: {{cd|block_particles}}{{note|Incorrectly called {{cd|block_effects}} in the official changelog.}} 
*** Specifies per-block particles. Each block particle is randomly chosen according to weights. A set limit of block particles is spawned each tick from all explosions that tick.
*** Format: List of entries.
**** {{cd|weight}}: Non-negative integer representing the random weight for this entry being chosen
**** {{cd|particle}}: The particle to spawn
**** {{cd|scaling}}: Optional scaling to apply between explosion center and block position, or {{cd|1.0}} if not specified
**** {{cd|speed}}: Optional scaling to apply to the speed of the particle, or {{cd|1.0}} if not specified

'''[[Entity data]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:player}}
** Changes to the {{cd|respawn}} object
*** {{cd|angle}} has been renamed to {{cd|yaw}} and is now a required field.
*** {{cd|pitch}} has been added as a required field.
*** {{cd|dimension}} is now a required field.

'''Game library updates'''
* Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.3 core profile.

'''[[Game rule]]'''
* The game rule {{cd|spawnChunkRadius}} was removed.

'''[[Jigsaw structure]]s'''
* The {{cd|max_distance_from_center}} field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal.
** This can be specified by an object with fields:
*** {{cd|horizontal}} - required integer between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|128}}.
*** {{cd|vertical}} - optional integer between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|4096}} (default: {{cd|4096}}).
**** e.g: <code>"max_distance_from_center": { "horizontal": 20, "vertical": 500 }</code>.
** The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported.

'''[[Key binds]]'''
* Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work.
** For example, it's now possible to bind the {{key|d}} key to Jump and Strafe Left, to jump and strafe left at the same time.
** The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow.
* Added a Spectator category in the key binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind.
* The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound.

'''[[Light]]'''
* Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the game.
** The underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction.
** This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or "hollow" such as: worn [[armor]], worn [[elytra]], the outside layers on player skins, the ribcages of [[skeleton]]s or [[skeleton horse]]s, the feet of [[chicken]]s or [[frog]]s, the wings of [[phantom]]s or the [[ender dragon]], the fins on [[fish]], and more.

'''[[Loading world screen]]'''
* The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn.
* The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar.
** This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above.
** It was in versions before [[Java Edition 1.3.1|1.3.1]] with a slightly different texture.

'''[[Loot functions]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:copy_name}}
** The {{cd|source}} field now accepts new context values:
*** {{cd|direct_attacker}}

** {{cd|interacting_entity}}, the optional entity that is interacting with the {{cd|block_state}}.
** {{cd|tool}}, the optional tool used to interact with {{cd|block_state}}.
* Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as {{cd|entity_properties.entity}}, can additionally target the {{cd|target_entity}} and {{cd|interacting_entity}} parameter types.
* Added {{cd|charged_creeper/root}} loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a [[charged creeper]].
** This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables:
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/piglin}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/creeper}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/skeleton}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/wither_skeleton}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/zombie}}
** Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same [[creeper]] will not drop from this loot table.
* Added {{cd|brush/armadillo}} loot table for drops when an [[armadillo]] is brushed.
* Added {{cd|gameplay/turtle_grow}} loot table for drops when a [[turtle]] grows into an adult.

* This feature can be disabled with "Allow Cursor Changes" option in "Mouse Settings..." menu.

'''[[Options]]'''
* A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen.
** The "Auto-Jump" option, as well as the "Sneak" and "Sprint" toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen.
* The "Show Subtitles" option has been renamed to "Closed Captions".
* The "Attack/Destroy" and "Use Item/Place Block" keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either "Hold" or "Toggle" in the Controls screen.
* The "Hide Lightning Flashes" accessibility setting has been renamed to "Hide Sky Flashes" and now also disables the [[End Flash]]es.
** When the flash is disabled by the setting the world will not be lit by the flash, but the flash source will still be visible in the sky and the sound effect will still play.
* Some sound sliders in the Music & Sound options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world.
* The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box.

'''[[Pack format]]'''
* The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions.
** A minor version increment of the game's pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working.
* Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version.

'''[[Pack.mcmeta]]'''
* The {{cd|pack.mcmeta}} format has been updated:
** The {{cd|supported_formats}} field has been removed.
*** If the pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < {{cd|82}}, resource pack < {{cd|65}}), it is still required.
*** Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed.
** The {{cd|pack_format}} field is now optional.
*** If the pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < {{cd|82}}, resource pack < {{cd|65}}), it is still required.
** Added required field {{cd|min_format}} - specifies the minimum version supported.
*** A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g {{cd|[74, 1]}}
*** Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. {{cd|74}} is the same thing as {{cd|[74, 0]}}.
*** Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone.
** Added required field {{cd|max_format}} - specified the maximum version supported.
*** A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g {{cd|[74, 1]}}
*** Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is {{cd|0x7fffffff}}.
*** Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone.
** For overlay entries:
*** The {{cd|formats}} field has been removed.
**** If the pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions.
**** Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed.
*** Added required field {{cd|min_format}} and {{cd|max_format}} with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the {{cd|pack}} section.

'''[[Panorama]]'''
* Updated the main menu panorama to show a village with [[copper golem]]s.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* {{cd|dragon_breath}} now optionally takes a {{cd|power}} parameter (float, default {{cd|1.0}}), which is multiplied onto its initial velocity, after all randomness.
* {{cd|instant_effect}} and {{cd|effect}} now optionally take {{cd|power}} (float, default {{cd|1.0}}) and {{cd|color}} (rgb, default {{cd|0xFFFFFF}}) parameters.
* {{cd|flash}} now requires a {{cd|color}} parameter (argb).

'''[[Rendering]]'''
* Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance.
** Areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms, will have a smoother gameplay.
** FPS will not improve much if most of the lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs.
* Particles outside of players view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|69.0}}.
* Added new block sprites: {{cd|acacia_shelf}}, {{cd|bamboo_shelf}}, {{cd|birch_shelf}}, {{cd|cherry_shelf}}, {{cd|copper}}, {{cd|copper_bars}}, {{cd|copper_chain}}, {{cd|copper_lantern}}, {{cd|copper_left}}, {{cd|copper_right}}, {{cd|copper_torch}}, {{cd|crimson_shelf}}, {{cd|dark_oak_shelf}}, {{cd|exposed_copper}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_bars}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_chain}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_lantern}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_left}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_right}}, {{cd|jungle_shelf}}, {{cd|mangrove_shelf}}, {{cd|oak_shelf}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_bars}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_chain}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_lantern}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_left}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_right}}, {{cd|pale_oak_shelf}}, {{cd|spruce_shelf}}, {{cd|warped_shelf}}, {{cd|weathered_copper}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_bars}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_chain}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_lantern}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_left}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_right}}

'''[[Server.properties]]'''
* A new boolean field has been added to {{samp|server.properties}} called <code>enable-code-of-conduct</code>.
** Setting it to <code>true</code> will make the server look for code of conduct files in the {{samp|codeofconduct}} subfolder in the same folder as {{samp|server.properties}}
** Each file in the folder should have the form {{samp|<language_code>.txt}}
*** The language shown will attempt to match the player's language.
*** If it doesn't exist, the {{samp|en_us}} code of conduct will be used.
*** If that also doesn't exist, an arbitrary available entry is used.
* Several server properties were removed in favour of making them into game rules, allowing these settings to be changed while the server is running.
* Removed server property <code>allow-nether</code> in favor of new game rule.
* Removed server property <code>enable-command-block</code> in favor of new game rule.
* Removed server property <code>pvp</code> in favor of new game rule.

** Defaults to an empty string.
* Added server property <code>status-heartbeat-interval</code> controlling the interval the management server sends heartbeat notifications to connected clients.
** Defaults to <code>0</code>, meaning it’s disabled.

'''Server Code of Conduct'''
* Formatting codes are now stripped from code of conduct files.

'''[[Shader]]s''' & '''Post-process effects'''
* The following unused shaders have been removed:
** {{samp|core/position_color_lightmap.vsh}}
** {{samp|core/position_color_lightmap.fsh}}
** {{samp|core/position_color_tex_lightmap.vsh}}

** These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad
* A new <code>PER_FACE_LIGHTING</code> flag has been added to the following shaders:
** <samp>core/entity.vsh</samp>
** <samp>core/entity.fsh</samp>
* When set, cardinal lighting will be computed separately for front- and back-faces.
* As the game now requires OpenGL 3.3, the version of all shaders are bumped from <code>150</code> to <code>330</code>.

'''[[Social Interactions]]'''
* Players that have joined a server are now always shown in the Social Interactions screen of that server even if they are offline.{{verify|Is this what it means? The original phrasing in the changelog is confusing.}}

'''[[Splashes]]'''

* The world border is now dimension-specific.
** This means that each dimension can have its own world border size, position, etc.

'''[[World generation]]'''
* The {{cd|initial_density_without_jaggedness}} field in {{cd|noise_settings}} definitions has been replaced with a {{cd|preliminary_surface_level}} field.
** {{cd|initial_density_without_jaggedness}} was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than {{cd|0.390625}}.
** {{cd|preliminary_surface_level}} is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface.
** The {{cd|minecraft:find_top_surface}} density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning.
