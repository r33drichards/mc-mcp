* Tamed wolves now have 40 [[health]] points (20 hearts) instead of 20 health points (10 hearts).

** In most cases this change makes no difference given the health boost, but now they can withstand more [[damage]] from [[player]]s and [[arrow]]s.
* Feeding a wolf now heals twice as many health points.
* Wolves now only get knocked back by [[snowball]]s from [[snow golem]]s, like other mobs, instead of also taking damage.

** Filters are defined in section called <code>filter</code>, available for every glyph provider.
*** Keys in that object are variant names (for example <code>uniform</code>).

=== Additions ===
==== Items ====
'''[[Wind charge]]'''
* It can now be obtained as an [[item]] by the player.
* The [[breeze]] drops between 4-6 wind charges when killed.
* When used, it fires off a wind charge projectile similar to the breeze's.
* A wind charge fired by a player grants 10% more knockback than a breeze's, but has a much smaller area of impact.
* Just like the projectile fired by the breeze, wind charges fired by the player also deals damage if they hit an entity directly, and they activate [[redstone components]].
* There is a half-second cooldown after each use.
* Wind charges can be fired from a [[dispenser]].
* Players that launch themselves with a wind charge only accumulate fall damage below the [[Altitude|Y-level]] of where they collided with the burst of wind.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
[[File:Vault JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Vault]]'''
* Tweaked the texture to make them easier to distinguish from [[trial spawner]]s, which changes the texture from [[File:Vault JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]].
