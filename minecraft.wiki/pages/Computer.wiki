A '''computer''' is a type of machine designed to compute large amounts of information, often leading to them developing {{Wikipedia|artificial intelligence}}.

== Appearance ==
Being machines, computers can vary in appearance, typically consisting of at least a screen, a speaker, and a keyboard. Many are designed to resemble models utilizing {{Wikipedia|cathode-ray tubes}}, which were prominent from the 1922 to 2012, with bland color schemes such as beige and white. Others utilize {{Wikipedia|vector monitors}}, identifiable by black and green displays.

As computers can gain independence and sentient, they often form overlap with robots, gaining appendages such as arms, legs, and laser guns.

== Behavior ==
Due to their purpose as tools, computers can be quite intelligent.
