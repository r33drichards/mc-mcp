'''Potato leaves''' are [[April Fools' Day jokes|joke]] blocks that can be found in the [[Potato dimension]] as the leaves of [[potato tree]]s, only present in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Potato leaves can be obtained only with [[shears]] or [[Silk Touch]] [[Enchanting|enchant]]ed tools. Unlike other [[leaves]], potato leaves are not [[Breaking|mine]]d any faster with a [[hoe]], but a [[sword]] does break the block faster.

=== Natural generation ===
Potato leaves generate in the [[Potato dimension]] on [[potato tree]]s, which grow in [[arboretum]] and [[corruption]] biomes. They also generate as part of [[potato village]]s, creating hedge mazes.
