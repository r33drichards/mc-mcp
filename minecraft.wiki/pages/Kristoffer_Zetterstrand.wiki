'''Kristoffer Zetterstrand''' is a Swedish artist. Kristoffer primarily paints classical paintings, but they are often influenced by pixelated computer graphics and 3D worlds. Most of the [[painting]]s in ''Minecraft'' were created by him. The file in which the paintings are stored is named <code>[[paintings_kristoffer_zetterstrand.png]]</code> {{in|je}} prior to [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]] and <code>[[kz.png]]</code> for his initials {{in|be}}.

Kristoffer is [[Notch]]'s former brother-in-law.<ref>{{w|Kristoffer Zetterstrand}} on Wikipedia</ref>
