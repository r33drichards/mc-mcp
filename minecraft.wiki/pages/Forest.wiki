The '''forest''' is a lush [[biome]] densely wooded with [[oak]] and [[birch]] trees. [[Wolves]] spawn here. The forest is the most common surface biome in ''Minecraft'', making up about 12% of the Overworld's area.

== Description ==
Forests feature dense [[tree]]s compared to other biomes. [[Lilies of the valley]], [[rose bush]]es, [[peonies]] and [[lilac]]s generate in this biome family along with the usual [[dandelion]]s; {{in|java}}, [[poppies]] also generate here. [[Bush|Bushes]] generate here in small patches. [[Leaf Litter|Leaf litter]] generates scattered on the ground. 
[[Grass Block|Grass]] takes on a dark but vibrant green color. Bees from bee nests on trees are found as well. 

Like almost every other [[Overworld]] biome in the game, [[lava lake]]s can generate here, which can cause locally destructive forest [[fire]]s, due to the density of flammable [[log]]s and [[leaves]]; the same goes for [[lightning]] strikes that hit the trees during [[thunderstorm]]s, though the fires caused by the strikes are usually quickly put out by the [[rain]].

A forest biome is well-suited for [[Survival]], as the most essential resource, [[Log|logs]], is abundantly available throughout.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
