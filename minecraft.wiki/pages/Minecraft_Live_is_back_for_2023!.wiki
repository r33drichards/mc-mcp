'''Minecraft Live is back for 2023!''' is a trailer announcing [[Minecraft Live 2023]] returning for 2023.

== Summary ==
[[Pink Petals|Petals]] fall in a [[cherry grove]], before suddenly taking on an amorphous shape and swarming in unison through a [[plains]], and then a [[desert]], a [[coral reef]], and a [[jungle]]. They then appear in a [[village]], where [[Noor]] is [[trimming]] an [[iron helmet]]. The leaves suddenly cause the helmet to drop, before summoning Noor into a strange spacial void to tell the viewer to "get ready." Curious, Noor begins to chase after the pink petals. The scene transitions to a [[stronghold]] infested with monsters, where [[Ari]] and [[Efe]] are reading, unaware of a potential ambush. The petals transport them too, now saying "Broadcast Live, Watch Online."

In a [[mangrove swamp]], [[Kai]] and [[Makena]] are already chasing the petals, jumping over various [[lily pads]] to reach it. They then converge with [[Steve]] in the cherry grove, where they discover a large, [[red concrete]] monument under construction by Noor, who waves. The petals then lift them up to Noor, giving them red concrete blocks to build with. Meanwhile, [[Sunny]] is digging up an [[archer sherd]] in a desert, before being interrupted by the petals to inform the viewer about the [[Mob Vote]] being in-game. Sunny then follows the petals into the grove, nearby a [[sniffer]], which is then also warped to text saying "On the Horizon News & Updates." As Sunny arrives at the construction site, {{MCL|Ranger}} and several {{MCL|cobblestone golem}}s also appear, and after them [[Zuri]].

Underground, several bats fly with the petals, passing an [[amethyst geode]], before reaching an [[ancient city]]. [[Alex]] is reaching into a [[chest]], claiming the [[ward armor trim]], and then getting shown the release date of ''Minecraft Live''. Dropping the trim, they run off to follow the petals, unknowingly summoning the [[Warden]]. However, the Warden is then shown the phrase "Be There! Be Square" by the petals. Alex then appears in the grove, and is lifted up directly in Steve's face. Sunny and Makena are placing down [[black concrete powder]] and [[black wool]], the build soon being completed and revealed as the logo of the event, as many more mobs run up to see it. Satisfied, the pink petals envelope the screen.
