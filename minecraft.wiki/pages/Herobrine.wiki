'''Herobrine''' is the subject of a community-made {{w|creepypasta}}. Despite being absent from all versions of the game, he is widely regarded as one of the major community icons of ''[[Minecraft]]''.

The first stories and images ever posted about Herobrine, as well as the Brocraft streams, are regarded as canonical, as they were fundamental to the creation and popularization of the character. Any portrayals of the character created after these events are considered fan-made adaptations and variations.

== Existence disclaimer ==
Herobrine does '''not''' exist in any official versions of ''Minecraft'', and never has. There are no references to him at all in the game's source code, and there is no code to allow for any [[entity]] to act like Herobrine. It is not possible for Herobrine to have ever existed in any unmodified [[client]]s or [[server]]s. Any appearances of Herobrine are caused by either [[mod|unofficial modifications]] being installed, or because of another [[player]] using a customized [[skin]] texture to resemble the character.

=== "White Eyes" ===
On July 31, 2010, [[Minecraft Forum]] user Flaky posted a comment, supposedly copied from a post on 4chan's /v/ board, containing a story of a player encountering an entity with glowing white eyes after listening to the [[Music Disc 13|"13" music disc]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/814622-13-ogg-a-work-of-fiction-updated-nov-7-twice?page=3#c54|title=(Note: Copied from /v/, I didn't write this and the poster was Anonymous)|website=Minecraft Forum|author=Flaky|date=July 31, 2010}}</ref> One supposed instance of these eyes was linked in the comment, which was a [[YouTube]] upload of "13" posted the previous day (the same day that the disc was added to the game), showing a [[screenshot]] of a dark [[cave]] with two white eyes edited into the bottom left corner.<ref>{{ytl|2cFpTSQDyzo|Minecraft "music" - 13.ogg|Curchack Curchack|July 30, 2010.}}</ref> This story is the first known instance of the concept of a creepypasta regarding a white-eyed paranormal being in ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{Tweet|OssyFlawol|1656857531946524677|So while conducting research on the original Herobrine image in order for me to make that fake ‘second post’, I ended up discovering something absolutely groundbreaking to our understanding of Herobrine’s origin point.<br><br>In short, the “original post” is not where he began. 1/?|May 11, 2023}}, thread</ref> These "white eyes" were likely inspired by a graphical bug in older versions that caused white dots to appear in the seams between blocks, which could resemble pairs of white eyes if two such dots were viewed from a distance.<ref>{{bug|MC-1794}}</ref>

The following day, Forum user Endorphine posted a thread recounting a myth surrounding the [[ambient sounds]] added to caves in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.3|Alpha v1.0.3]], in which "a pair of white pixels" would appear whenever these sounds would play.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/114746-i-cannot-take-it-anymore|title=I cannot take it anymore.|website=Minecraft Forum|author=Endorphine|date=August 1, 2010}}</ref> The same video was linked as an example of an appearance of these white pixels. The phenomenon was attributed to "White Eyes", a female creature who would stalk the player from afar with no visible traits other than her blank white eyes.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/114746-i-cannot-take-it-anymore?comment=8|title=No, You're wrong. It's "White Eyes" as we named her.|website=Minecraft Forum|author=Endorphine|date=August 1, 2010}}</ref>

=== Herobrine creepypasta ===
The "White Eyes" story began spreading through the Minecraft Forum, either stemming from or being popularized by the aforementioned thread. On August 24, a modified version of the story appeared, in which "White Eyes" was now a default player model with whited out eyes.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/115039-horror-in-minecraft|title=Horror in minecraft|website=Minecraft Forum|author=Goatie|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>

At some point before August 19,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221118014621/https://twitter.com/TacticsNNiblics/status/21587389080|title=@xnotch Hey, someone made a story about your brother Herobrine!

The exact origin of this version of the story is unknown, with the earliest known instances of it being from a blog post from August 22, 2010,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204220637/https://inuscreepystuff.blogspot.com/2010/08/minecraft.html|title=Minecraft|website=Creepy + Pasta|author=Inunah|date=August 22, 2010}}</ref> a comment in a Minecraft Forum thread on August 30,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903055441/http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=29828&start=30|title=How about he's in the game BUT doesn't exist in any of the code, At all.... /rant|website=Minecraft Forum|author=TheCameraWorks|date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> and a now-deleted image posted on 4chan's paranormal /x/ board on August 31.<ref>[http://images.4chan.org/x/src/1283223082465.jpg Original defunct link] to the earliest known post containing the Herobrine story. The filename "1283223082465.jpg" is a {{w|Unix time}}stamp which points to this image being posted on August 31, 2010, at 02:51:22 GMT.</ref>

The story details an encounter in ''Minecraft'' with a nameless human entity in a single-player [[world]] who displayed strange behavior such as stalking the player from afar, creating unnatural constructions such as [[sand]] pyramids in the [[ocean]] and long 2×2 tunnels, and removing [[leaves]] from [[tree]]s. The writer then attempted to start a topic about the encounter on the Minecraft Forum, only to have it be repeatedly deleted, followed by a private message from a seemingly nonexistent user named "Herobrine" telling them to stop. The 4chan post also contained a screenshot of the encounter, showing Herobrine in the distance amidst the [[fog]].

=== Brocraft streams ===
:''For more detailed information regarding the Brocraft events, see [[Herobrine/StreamFAQ|the Minecraft Wiki's interview with Copeland]] and [[Herobrine/StreamStory|his recounting of the events]].''
Brocraft streamer Copeland came across the Herobrine story on 4chan's /v/ board and took a liking to it. He edited Herobrine into several screenshots to show to his chat and, after getting largely good reactions, decided to stage a hoax; he changed the [[texture]] of a [[painting]] to display Herobrine and put it in a work-in-progress house in his world, planning to show it on a livestream. On August 30, Copeland started a livestream and played through the world as a normal player would, deliberately avoiding the work-in-progress room he had set up for the hoax. He talked about the "ghost" in his screenshots throughout the stream, asserting that it was real and referring to it as "Him", which would later become another nickname for the character.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/802277-the-white-eyes-him-dead-notch-explained|title=The "White Eyes", "Him", "Dead notch" explained.|website=Minecraft Forum|author=bobsbees|date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> At about 20 minutes and 45 seconds in, Copeland entered the room and saw the re-textured painting, then screamed and ran out, promptly ending the stream. He pretended to be shaken up in the chat and later posted a message onto the forums, linking to the video to spread it around in the hopes of getting similar reactions.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324021021/https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/show-your-creation/fan-art/other-fan-art/1582915-video-proof-of-him|title=Video Proof of "him"|website=Minecraft Forum|author=Copeland|date=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Other users in the thread began debating whether Copeland's sighting was real and started posting their own screenshots with Herobrine edited into them.<ref name=who>{{ytl|clElrb1mBmw|Who is Herobrine?|Jamook|November 25, 2010}}</ref> After a while, Copeland removed the painting and reverted to normal textures, then proceeded to stream further, pretending to be scared. He announced that he would delete the world to never meet Herobrine again.

Later on, fellow streamer Patimuss made a stream showing Herobrine near a user-made [[lava]] pool. This Herobrine was free-standing, unlike in the previous stream, indicating that he was a retextured [[door]]. The livestream went down after Patimuss ran away and saved his game, only to resume ten minutes later, where Herobrine had supposedly disappeared. Afterward, during the second stream, Patimuss could be heard talking to his wife, stating he was trolling, which flooded the livestream chat with outrage. He then faked a game [[crash]] and the stream proceeded later with no further Herobrine sightings. Copeland disliked that Patimuss outed Herobrine as a fake.

[[File:HerobrineBrocastCreepyPage.gif|thumb|200px|The image in the "Him" website, linked to Brocraft viewers after the Herobrine stream.]]

Around the time of Patimuss' stream, Copeland posted links in chat leading to the website [https://web.archive.org/web/20130710001351/http://ghostinthestream.net/him.html http://ghostinthestream.net/him.html]. The page featured [[Steve]]'s face, but with his original eyes made pitch black and replaced with real, frantically rolling eyes. Below the face, there was a jumble of characters and letters. After removing all non-alphabet characters, the text is revealed to be a slightly edited version of another creepypasta entitled "Wake Up?", which is written as a note to the reader explaining that they have retreated to a "fantasy world" due to suffering from torture (specified as rape in the original text) and that they need to "wake up".<ref>[https://www.creepypasta.com/wake-up/ Wake Up?] – Creepypasta.com, October 21, 2008</ref>

{{Q|It has been  reported  that some victims of torture,  during  the act, would retreat  into  a fantasy world from which they could not WAKE UP. In this  catatonic state, the victim lived in a world just like their normal one, except they weren't being tortured. The only way that they realized they needed to WAKE UP  was a note they found in their fantasy world. It would tell them about their condition, and tell them to WAKE UP. Even then, it would often take months until they were ready to discard their fantasy world and PLEASE WAKE UP.}}

=== Increase in popularity ===
[[File:Herobrine.jpg|thumb|An example of a Herobrine sighting.]]
Following these events, the popularity of the character began to increase, propelling Herobrine to meme status and making him an icon of the community. Numerous screenshots, animations, pieces of artwork, constructions, and videos of Herobrine were created, with the earliest among them being created on the same day as the original livestreams.<ref>{{ytl|rVfiw7ltJeg|Minecraft alpha "Him" apparition|KnukN|August 30, 2010.}}</ref>

Not long after the Brocraft streams propelled Herobrine into popularity, all of the Brocraft streams in which he was featured were deleted, and not archived elsewhere. Before [[#Streams recovered|the streams' recovery]] on July 15, 2024, only a few screenshots and written descriptions of the contents of the livestreams still existed, despite many intensive and thorough search efforts. Copeland continued to adamantly state Herobrine was real for about a year onward.

Notch learned about the story of a "white eye miner" and stated on IRC, "there's no white eyed creepy mob like that - but I TOTALLY should add one now." He also joked about adding entire villages of white eyed humans.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/Minecraft-IRCLogs Minecraft IRC Logs], Adura.7z, 2010-08-30_#minecraft.log</ref> At [[MinecraftCon 2010]], the day after Herobrine's popularity boost from the livestreams, Notch confirmed Herobrine was a hoax, but jokingly alluded to the possibility that he might not be.<ref>{{ytl|7vjhooRq3Ek|MinecraftCon 2010|Miles Smith|September 1, 2010}}</ref> The next day, Notch posted on Twitter about the subject of Herobrine: in reply to a tweet asking if Herobrine was a real entity in-game, Notch replied saying that he was not, but that he "might be soon".<ref>{{tweet|notch|22623080852|It's not real. <nowiki>=</nowiki>) But it might be soon!|September 1, 2010}}</ref> This further confirmed there was no Herobrine, but again suggested the possibility that Notch planned to add him at a later date.

In October 2010, due to increased drama surrounding the [[Minecraft Wiki (website)|Minecraft Wiki's]] page on Herobrine, a wiki administrator asked Notch over [[w:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] if he would ever be added, to which Notch replied "i{{sic}} have no plans of adding herobrine as is, but I do like the rumors, haha."{{cn}} This showed Notch had decided against adding Herobrine, but the use of the wording "as is" suggested that something like Herobrine may be added, further fueling beliefs that he would be implemented. Once again, the same user asked for clarification, saying that the ''Minecraft'' community was "getting frustrated by the hero-spam", to which Notch replied that he had no plans for adding Herobrine into the game.<ref>{{tweet|notch|27871748827|@Kizzycocoa i have no plans of adding herobrine.|October 19, 2010}}</ref>

=== Modded versions ===
[[File:Herobrine Shrine.png|thumb|An altar used to summon Herobrine in several mods, including the earliest known plugin.]]
On December 10, 2010, hMod Forums user tkelly released the earliest known Herobrine mod, a server plugin called "iLoveYou".<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720002711/http://topica-rp.com/hmod/forum/showthread3b9b.html|title=<nowiki>[MISC] Herobrine v0.3.1 [133]</nowiki>|website=hMod Forums|author=tkelly|date=December 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|ekq34||Herobrine plugin for hMod|Flandoo|December 12, 2010}}</ref> In the plugin, Herobrine can be summoned by building an altar made of [[gold block]]s, [[netherrack]], [[redstone torch]]es and [[mossy cobblestone]], and igniting the netherrack on top.<ref name=summon>{{ytl|syTY4ctONGY|<nowiki>[How To] Summon HeroBrine[GER]</nowiki>|SakusLP|December 29, 2010}}</ref> The mod's version of Herobrine exhibits behaviors similar to those in the original creepypasta and livestreams, as well as new behaviors, such as placing redstone torches,<ref name=tkelly1>{{ytl|R1FvV9-UHHI|Herobrine|tkellyMC|December 10, 2010}}</ref> building underground dungeons,<ref name=tkelly2>{{ytl|u-5bjoj4ruM|Herobrine 0.2|tkellyMC|December 11, 2010}}</ref> teleporting behind players,<ref name=tkelly3>{{ytl|RLiYsHjRSxY|Herobrine 12-12|tkellyMC|December 12, 2010}}</ref> and luring players into traps.<ref name=trap>https://bukkit.org/threads/req-the-herobrine-plugin.19251/#post-351702 https://web.archive.org/web/20161211014805/https://bukkit.org/threads/req-the-herobrine-plugin.19251/</ref> Many YouTube videos from around the time of this plugin's release show players encountering or summoning this modded version of Herobrine on many different servers,<ref name=how>{{ytl|BeM7O25lcr8|Minecraft - How to summon Herobrine|Phaseout|December 31, 2010}}</ref><ref name=to>{{ytl|mGR4bAlt-Xo|Summoning Herobrine|BIJ|January 1, 2011}}</ref> indicating that the plugin was widespread enough to influence the playerbase's perception of Herobrine, and many of Herobrine's traits and abilities introduced in the mod became established in the community as part of the character. Updated versions of this plugin created by other users still exist on the Internet,<ref>{{citation|url=https://github.com/darkdiplomat/iLoveYou|title=iLoveYou|website=GitHub|author=darkdiplomat|date=March 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>https://archive.org/details/iloveyou_202211</ref> but the original plugin from the original creator is currently lost.

Later, on July 29, 2011, a more popular Herobrine mod was released by the Minecraft Forum user burnner.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275595-the-herobrine-mod-official-3-6|title=The Herobrine Mod OFFICIAL 3.6|website=Minecraft Forums|author=burnner_|date=July 29, 2011}}</ref> This mod also lets players summon Herobrine by building and igniting an altar made of gold and netherrack, though the arrangement and composition of blocks is different, and a new "Herobrine Totem" block is required. This mod's version of Herobrine retains many of his abilities from the canon sources and original mod while gaining many new ones, such as using [[tool]]s, placing [[sign]]s, possessing [[animal]]s, and spawning [[undead mob]]s. Herobrine is much more hostile in this mod and regularly attacks players directly, unlike in the original mod where Herobrine is rarely encountered and less overtly hostile. Many subsequent Herobrine mods have been made since, many of them employing numerous concepts that originated in these early examples. Such mods are the only way Herobrine can actually exist in the game.

=== Later status ===
From 2011 onward, Herobrine's popularity continued to grow as more fan creations featuring the character were created. Many "sightings", modded gameplay videos, and animations featuring Herobrine would reach tens of millions of views on YouTube during the following years.<ref>{{ytl|I-sH53vXP2A|"Fallen Kingdom" - A Minecraft Parody of Coldplay's Viva la Vida (Music Video)|CaptainSparklez|April 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=found>{{ytl|9-XH-CuBAY0|I FOUND herobrine Minecraft PE|SpaceWaffle|July 19, 2012}}</ref> Numerous imitation characters with varying levels of popularity were created with Herobrine as the main inspiration, but Herobrine would always remain by far the most popular.

As the role of lead developer of ''Minecraft'' was passed on from Notch to [[Jeb]], the chance of Herobrine appearing in an update became unclear. On August 22, 2012, [[Dinnerbone]], current joint developer of ''Minecraft'', tweeted "We have no plans at all to add herobrine{{Sic}}. I doubt this will ever change."<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|238278012632707072|@Kizzycocoa We have no plans at all to add herobrine. I doubt this will ever change.|August 22, 2012}}</ref> Mojang has stated on the [[feedback site]] that no creepypastas will be added to the game. And they said "You know the ones we mean". This confirms that Herobrine will never ever appear in ''Minecraft'', and that any claims of "finding" Herobrine in vanilla ''Minecraft'' in future updates are completely unfounded.

=== Seed discovered ===
In September 2020, the seed finding group [https://minecraftathome.com/projects/about.html Minecraft@Home] began a project to attempt to discover the [[world seed]] that the original Herobrine screenshot was taken on. The process involved building an exact recreation of the terrain visible in the screenshot and reverse engineering the specific world generation that would have produced the terrain, then attempting to locate seeds that generated the same terrain in the same version. Factors involved included the rotation of block top textures, the probable location of chunk borders, the placement and shape of the trees, and the fact that leaves on trees would sometimes decay during alpha due to a bug, creating a discrepancy between the originally generated terrain and the terrain visible in the screenshot. After several months, the seed was finally discovered in January 2021 to be {{cd|478868574082066804}}, with the player's position at the [[coordinates]] x=5.06, y=71, z=-298.54.<ref name=seed>{{citation|url=https://minecraftathome.com/herobrine|title=The World of Herobrine|website=Minecraft @ Home}}</ref>

=== Streams recovered ===
The original Brocraft streams were considered lost until they were rediscovered on July 15, 2024. A long-running project by Enderboss25 managed to locate both streams approximately 14 years after they were first broadcasted. The streams had been downloaded by the YouTube user @brutallillfjomp, who stated in a comment that "I had no idea this was lost media. I downloaded that stream back in the day. I've had it uploaded privately to my channel for years, thinking it was nothing special. l've made the two videos available on my channel now, as well as some Herobrine clip I download from YouTube back in the day."

He proceeded to upload both the Copeland stream,<ref name=stream>https://archive.org/details/copeland-lost-herobrine-stream</ref><ref>{{ytl|qRzX7CDxQsI|Live Show Procaster Mon Aug 30 2010 11 24 42 AM on Minecrafterryday live streaming video powere|brutallillfjomp|July 15, 2024}}</ref> and the Patimuss stream.<ref name=stream/><ref>{{ytl|-YNi0yE8Q5w|Live Show Procaster Mon Aug 30 2010 11 56 23 PM on Minecrafterryday live streaming video powere|brutallillfjomp|July 15, 2024}}</ref>

== Description ==
=== Canonical ===
[[File:Herobrine Sighting.png|thumb|Another early Herobrine image.]]
Herobrine is said to be Notch's deceased brother, somehow embedded into ''Minecraft'' as a human entity with the player skin of Steve, but with completely white eyes and no visible irises or pupils. His appearance differs between the canonical sources; in Copeland's livestream, he had the beard seen in Steve's original design, while in the original 4chan image and Copeland's edited screenshot, the beard appears to be absent.

Herobrine is able to build and destroy in the game. The original story states the player found long 2×2 tunnels, small pyramids in the middle of the ocean, and trees with no leaves. The full extent of his building capacity is unknown, but the given examples indicate Herobrine has awareness of shape and can differentiate materials from each other. Herobrine shows more characteristics of being a form of virus, such as manipulating game worlds, deleting Minecraft Forum topics, sending messages to forum users, and, according to Copeland's livestream, changing the skins of other players. He is not seen communicating with players in-game, but he does have the ability to communicate through the internet. Copeland also claimed at one point in his livestream that Herobrine was controlling his keyboard, though this was stated in a more joking manner.

Herobrine seems to solely target players. He did not seem to interact with any other [[mob]]s nearby in the Brocraft streams, some of which were [[spider]]s and [[zombie]]s. His canonical relation to further mobs added since he appeared is a complete mystery. His interactions with other mobs are not mentioned in the original image. While there is a [[chicken]] present in the image, Herobrine does not seem interested in it at all, and is solely focused on the player.

In both the original creepypasta and the Brocraft streams, Herobrine appears in the world without any apparent cause, and his presence is not implied to be due to a player's actions. In the creepypasta, he seems to avoid the player and appears to only be active in unexplored areas, whereas in the streams he seems to intentionally get close to players and appears mainly near player constructions.

[[File:Herobrine Totem.png|thumb|A totem used to summon Herobrine in burnner's Herobrine mod, and several other mods.]]
The pronunciation of the name "Herobrine" is not specified in any of the canonical sources, leaving it as a subject of debate. Most pronounce the "Hero" part of the name as either /hɪəɹəʊ/ (as in the word "hero") or /hɛɹoʊ/ ("Heh-roh"), while the "-brine" part is most commonly pronounced as /bɹaɪn/ (as in the word "brine") but may be /bɹɪn/ ("brin") or /bɹiːn/ ("breen").{{cn}}

Though his hands are usually empty, Herobrine is sometimes depicted holding tools, such as [[pickaxe]]s.<ref>{{ytl|UHzQhLQLLYM|Herobrine sighting - Minecraft 1.7.3|Albatross960|July 9, 2011}}</ref> This stems from the widespread community belief that Herobrine is a dead miner, killed long before the player's arrival.{{citation needed}} His appearance does not suggest this is the case, though with <i>Minecraft</i>'s [[mineshaft]]s and [[stronghold]]s, as well as mining being a large part of the game, the game itself has shaped public perception of the character to suit this persona. While he usually doesn't seem to have any home besides the underground tunnels and dungeons he builds, he sometimes has a large base of operations, such as a castle<ref>{{ytl|Kwwl9jiJ1A4|"Take Back the Night" - A Minecraft Original Music Video|CaptainSparklez|August 31, 2013}}
</ref> or mansion.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/herobrines-mansion-adventure-map|title=Herobrine's Mansion (Adventure Map)|website=Planet Minecraft|author=Hypixel|date=November 3, 2012}}</ref>

Herobrine occasionally interacts with other mobs. He is sometimes able to take control of passive animals, causing them to also exhibit his blank white eyes,<ref name=who/> and revive/spawn undead mobs.<ref>{{ytl|ZxU-h6JCq0M|Minecraft: Herobrine Mod (Herobrine, Notch, Evil Chickens and More!)

Herobrine's intentions vary, but they usually fall under two categories: the "stalker" variation, based on the original canonical events, and the "vengeful" variation, derived from community interpretation. In the "stalker" variation, he stalks the player, disappearing if approached. In the "vengeful" variation, he tries to ensnare the player in traps, presumably to steal their [[item]]s. He waits for people to enter his dungeons, then either seals them inside,<ref>{{ytl|bjFaRSSgF_o|Minecraft HeroBrine wurde gesichtet|SakusLP|December 27, 2010}}</ref> or teleports behind them,<ref name=tkelly3/> presumably killing them. Some rarer variations of the latter state he breaks the player's creations<ref>{{ytl|2B4KAsDsa9s|Herobrine sighting|Nombombs|November 3, 2010}}</ref> and steals their items from [[chest]]s.<ref>{{ytl|B2Vtcewizvc|minecraft : Herobrine in my house?!?!?!?!|TheKittyGamer|August 22, 2011}}</ref>

A popular idea in the community is that Herobrine can be "summoned" through the use of a special arrangement of [[block]]s; such a structure is usually referred to as a "Herobrine altar", "Herobrine shrine", "Herobrine totem" or "Herobrine spawner". Typically, this is a 3×3 horizontal square of gold blocks, with a block of netherrack placed on top and four redstone torches placed upright on each side.<ref name=summon/> The block beneath the netherrack varies between versions, with common choices being mossy cobblestone,<ref name=how/> [[soul sand]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275595-the-herobrine-mod-official-3-6?comment=241|title=If I may make a suggestion for the summoning: Make it a more expensive recipe.

== Official cameos ==
Herobrine has appeared or been mentioned in official [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] images and webpages as an inside joke. His first appearance in official Mojang images was with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20210221084148/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/8829997577/wedding-weekend Wedding Weekend] in August 2011, in which he was just behind Notch's ''Minecraft'' character. He then made several appearances in material related to [[MINECON 2011]]: firstly the website header, where he was just behind Notch yet again.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110922104118/http://minecon.mojang.com/</ref> He then appeared in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y2NACUlwmE the official MINECON 2011 trailer] created by Hat Films, at 3:11, after players were asked to submit skins to appear in the trailer.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030195746/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pv9mzW1Cms|title=Minecraft Trailer Competition!|website=YouTube|author=HaatFilms|date=October 26, 2011}}</ref> In the convention itself, a Herobrine statue was present in the Xbox section, on the board behind the Xbox stations. During the closing of the convention, a user named Zaralith won the Herobrine statue by correctly answering the give-away question "How many Fable games are there?" Some users have pointed to this as proof of his future addition, however there is no proof he has been portrayed for anything other than baiting fans.

Herobrine then appeared in the instruction booklets of some of the first [[LEGO Minecraft]] sets, among other ''Minecraft'' [[character]]s. He also appeared in [https://www.facebook.com/minecraft ''Minecraft's'' Facebook page] on the cover photo in summer 2012,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726122129/http://www.facebook.com/minecraft|title=Minecraft|website=Facebook}}</ref> although the image was created by a fan for a competition with the theme of "summer picnic", hence his inclusion may not be fully intentional.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120712190445/http://mojang.com/</ref>

In September 2013, developer [[Marc Watson]] created a series of skins for the [[head]] model. These skins were made to ensure a stable skin for various official entities could be used without fear that the skin could change. Herobrine is one of the skins that can be obtained through this system by using the command {{cmd|give @s player_head[profile{{=}}"MHF_Herobrine"]}}{{only|java}} (with "MHF" standing for "Marc's Head Format"). The command gives a player head from a player named "MHF_Herobrine", and in ''Bedrock Edition'', the same skin can be [https://namemc.com/profile/MHF_Herobrine.1 downloaded] as an image, and used in game. The skin used to show Herobrine without a beard and was originally taken from the Herobrine account. It was changed in December 2017 to use the same beard that Steve and the [[Mob (entity)|mob]] had before the release of [[Survival Test]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://namemc.com/profile/MHF_Herobrine.1|title=MHF_Herobrine|website=NameMC}}</ref>

In 2018, grafitti reading "Herobrine was here" can be seen in [[Cats & Pandas: A Minecraft Fable of Friendship]]. In the [[Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34]] April Fools' update, "Removing Herobrine" is one of the episodes. On the ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'' FAQ site, Herobrine used to be mentioned in one of the frequently asked questions about the game; the question was "Is Herobrine in this game too?" and the answer given was "<REDACTED>".<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/earth/faq|title=Minecraft Earth FAQ|website=Minecraft.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725021053/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/earth/faq}}</ref> This was later removed from the FAQ page. In the [https://discord.com/invite/minecraft Official Minecraft Discord], there is a sticker called "Him", which references the image in the "Him" website linked to Brocraft viewers after the Herobrine stream.

=== Legacy Console Editions ===
One of the in-game [[loading tips]] in the [[Legacy Console Edition]]s references Herobrine: "We think [[4J Studios]] has removed Herobrine from the [console] console game, but we're not too sure."

Herobrine is part of [[Skin Pack 1]] released on the Legacy Console Editions. Because of this addition, "sightings" rose drastically due to players using the skin. However, the skin was omitted from the [[Bedrock Edition]] version of the skin pack.<ref>{{Mcnet|moana-and-xbox-characters-come-minecraft|Moana and Xbox Characters Come to Minecraft!|January 30, 2018|Marsh Davies}}</ref> Herobrine then made more appearances as a "Zombie Herobrine" skin in [[Skin Pack 3]], a "Party Herobrine" skin in the [[1st Birthday Skin Pack]], and an "Xmas Herobrine" skin in the [[Festive Mash-up]] pack.

Shirts featuring Herobrine's face were available on [[Xbox 360 Edition|Xbox 360]] as [[Xbox 360 Edition/Avatar items|paid avatar items]]. [[Xbox 360 Edition/Gamerpics|Gamerpics]] featuring Herobrine were also included in the "Enemies", "Faces" and "Mobs in Suits 2" gamerpic packs.

=== Marketplace ===
In [[10 Years of Minecraft]], Herobrine is alluded to several times. While approaching The Academy, players use a codec credited to Herobrine, which can be used to translate the phrase "I have a spine, front and back but bones and teeth are what I lack, on me you can write your name but first craft me with 3 sugar-cane." Beneath the Mob Garden is a small labyrinth that concludes at a tunnel, lined with banners of Herobrine, with the reward of eleven [[Golden Apple|golden apples]].

In [[15 Year Journey]], the seed in the original screenshot is referenced at the beginning of the Alpha minigame. It can be seen should the player turn around at the very start of the game.<gallery>

=== Changelogs ===
[[File:1.7 changelist.png|thumb|A blurred changelog for Beta 1.7 that Notch posted on Twitter, with the words "Removed Herobrine" at the bottom.]]

Herobrine has been said to be removed from the game in numerous changelog entries. The first of these mentions was in [[Beta 1.6.6]], as a joke referring to the partial removal of the human mob's essential code, making it unspawnable within ''Minecraft''. An ulterior motive may have been to troll the community, as this was around the time Herobrine had gained memetic status. After that, most ''Minecraft'' update changelogs since then until [[Java Edition 1.16.2]] included the entry "Removed Herobrine" at least once every update cycle as a running gag, with an exception, [[Java Edition 1.1]]. This changed after Java Edition 1.16.2, where he was never mentioned in any changelogs up until [[Java Edition 1.20]], where the "Removed Herobrine" entry reappeared. This entry has been included in most subsequent changelogs.

In the changelog of [[Minecraft Launcher]] version [[Launcher 2.2.176x|2.2.176x]], released soon after the [[world seed]] of the original Herobrine screenshot was discovered, the developers said that they "removed Herobrine from [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.16_02|Java Alpha 1.0.16_02]]", the version in which the screenshot was taken.

In an [https://web.archive.org/web/20120714105228/https://www.mojang.com/2012/07/minecraft-xbox-360-edition-update-is-out/ update for Xbox 360] on July 13, 2012 ([[Xbox 360 Edition TU3]]), Herobrine was stated to be removed from the [[Xbox 360 Edition]] of ''Minecraft'' for the first time. He was then removed again in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU5]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-editions/minecraft-xbox-360-edition/mcx360-discussion/2064202-mcxbla-title-update-change-logs|title=MCXBLA Title Update change logs|website=Minecraft Forum|author=padware|date=June 8, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:AMCM Herobrine.webp|thumb|width=168x168|Herobrine in {{AMCM}}.]]
Within {{AMCM}}, an {{AMCM|enderman}} uses a psychic ability, creating visions of people close to their victims to "fry [their] brain". During this sequence, the illusion of {{AMCM|Steve}} has white eyes while the other characters have purple eyes. In a tweet on April 6th 2025, [[Torfi Frans Olafsson]], the producer of the film, stated that "it's super strange" that the eyes of one character "kept coming out white", jokingly adding that this was due to a VFX error which was left in because of time constraints.<ref>{{tweet|torfi_F_Olafss|1908910433018491319|It’s super strange that all of their eyes were supposed to be purple but when it was rendered one of the characters eyes kept coming out white in the final rendered frames so we wound up keeping it like that, because the VFX studio ran out of time. @AMinecraftMovie|April 6, 2025}}</ref> The tweet was later quoted by the main Minecraft account with a curious emoji.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1908911301776318879|🤔|April 6, 2025}}</ref>

A minor character early in the film was also speculated to be a reference to Herobrine; during Steve's backstory, he "yearned for the {{AMCM|mine}}s". However, he was always thwarted by an {{AMCM|old miner}}. This character lacks any official name, but rumors spread that this character was meant to be Herobrine. One variation of the rumor says he goes by the name "Harold Bryne" or several other variations.<ref>{{Tweet|MinecraftMeme16|1913620165297664022|Guys I have a theory on who this miner could be and why he didn’t die of old age over 30 years|April 19, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://neutral-characters.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_Old_Miner_(A_Minecraft_Movie)?diff=next&oldid=40435&diffonly=1|title=Unnamed Old Miner (A Minecraft Movie) - Revision as of 12:40, 19 April 2025|section=|website=Neutral Characters Wiki|author=GottaGoFastJr|date=|quote=Updated information based on cast and director interviews|archive-url}}</ref> When Torfi Frans Olafsson was asked about this,<ref>{{Tweet|BoyBeyondStars|1914045567560499304|@torfi_F_Olafss are you allowed to speak on this|April 20, 2025}}</ref> he joked that he made a promise to not say anything.<ref>{{tweet|torfi_F_Olafss|1914089646805377166|No, they made us promise not to tell...|April 20, 2025}}</ref>

== Mojang reactions ==

Mojang has, albeit rarely, shared their views on Herobrine. Their reactions have varied from plainly stating that he does not exist to Notch saying he appears only when players ask him.

== Lost media ==
No known archive exists of the earliest 4chan thread containing the original Herobrine story, and it is not known where the earliest known image of the creepypasta originated.

The earliest known Herobrine plugin was located [http://taylorkelly.me/plugins/Herobrine/ here].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://taylorkelly.me/plugins/Herobrine/|title=Index of /plugins/Herobrine|website=taylorkelly.me|archive=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126140917/http://taylorkelly.me/plugins/Herobrine/|archive-time=January 26, 2011}}</ref> This was deleted at some point during the following months, and no known backups of any of the original versions of the plugin are available.

== Trivia ==
*When asked about audio player implementation on the wiki, and the limits of what could be uploaded, [[C418]] replied to Herobrine claims relating to [[Music Disc 11|disc 11]]. He stated that he cannot say a lot about 11, but that it has nothing to do with Herobrine.{{citation needed}}
*There is [https://namemc.com/profile/Herobrine.1 a user called Herobrine] registered on ''Minecraft'' servers. The account is a full account (meaning they have bought ''Minecraft'' after registering). They do not appear to have migrated their account or visited any [[MINECON]] events using the Herobrine username, due to their lack of a [[cape]]. Ex-Mojang employee [[Andrea Jörgensen]] stated that a friend of hers owns the Herobrine account.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004113029/https://twitter.com/AndiJorgensen/status/206397260626538497|title=@notch A friend of mine owns the Minecraft account named Herobrine... he gets plenty of password reset emails ever day.}} – {{tweet|AndiJorgensen}}, May 26, 2012</ref>
*The seed for the world used in the original screenshot is {{cd|478868574082066804}}, with the player's position at the coordinates x=5.06, y=71, z=-298.54. The screenshot was made using [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.16 02|Alpha v1.0.16_02]].<ref name=seed/>
*The seed for the world used in the original livestream is {{cd|3609313613745973624}}. The livestream was made using [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.17 04|Alpha v1.0.17_04]].
**Copeland eventually rediscovered the original world in which he had filmed the original Herobrine livestream, and made the world available to download [https://www.mediafire.com/file/tfyceqz5rsgshq1/Copeland%2527s_Herobrine_World.zip/file here].<ref>{{ytl|DA3cMLL4SYc|The Mystery of the Lost Herobrine Stream: Part 2 ~ Secrets Revealed|Enderboss25|August 2, 2021}}</ref>
*The Doku RPG texture pack, not to be confused with [https://dokucraft.co.uk/ Dokucraft], was used in Copeland's original screenshot and livestream.<ref> {{citation|url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223202-dokus-rpg-texture-pack-v-1-2-released-09-09|title=Doku RPG|section=|website=[http://www.minecraftforum.net/ Minecraft Forum]|author=|date=|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206030147/http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1223202-dokus-rpg-texture-pack-v-1-2-released-09-09}}</ref>
*The original creepypasta states that the author heard back from their informant about a month after taking a screenshot of Herobrine. However, while the creepypasta was created on August 19 at the latest, the screenshot was taken in the version Alpha v1.0.16_02, which was released on August 13, making it impossible for that much time to have elapsed.

=== Publicity ===
*Vareide, the creator of several officially featured ''Minecraft'' trailers, also made a video about Herobrine<ref>{{YouTube link|uUZDHEpW5D0|Herobrine|This channel is not active|August 29, 2011|archive=1}}</ref>.
*The Herobrine altar was referenced in the video [[One Trillion Minecraft Views on YouTube and Counting]], at 0:33.
*Based on Herobrine's popularity, from 2013 to 2017, author Mark Cheverton wrote the ''{{W|Gameknight999|newtab=1}}'' series of 24 novels in 6 trilogies, featuring Herobrine as the primary antagonist. The series is unofficially based on ''Minecraft''.
