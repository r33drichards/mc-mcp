A '''wooden fence''' is the wooden variant of [[fence]]s, crafted using planks and sticks.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Wooden fences are broken most quickly with an [[axe]], but drop when broken with any tool.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Mineshaft with fences.png|thumb|right|Fence blocks naturally generate as mineshaft supports.]]

; {{BlockSprite|Oak Fence|text=Oak}}
Oak fences generate as part of:
* Regular [[mineshaft]]s, as the uprights for the supports, where they are plentiful.
* Library rooms of [[stronghold]]s as railings and chandeliers. In the latter case, there are many [[torch]]es attached to them.
* Plains [[village]]s
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s
* [[Trial chambers]] (a hidden chamber inside of the "Intersection 2" room)

; {{BlockSprite|Spruce Fence|text=Spruce}}
Spruce fences generate as part of:
* [[Swamp hut]]s
* [[Taiga]] and [[snowy tundra]] [[village]]s, where they appear in tables, animal pen, butcher and shepherd houses, lantern lamp post, and other buildings.
* [[Shipwreck]]s

; {{BlockSprite|Birch Fence|text=Birch}}
Birch fences generate as part of:
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s

; {{BlockSprite|Jungle Fence|text=Jungle}}
Jungle fences generate as part of:
* Desert village armorer houses as the window.
* [[Shipwreck]]s

; {{BlockSprite|Acacia Fence|text=Acacia}}
Acacia fences generate as part of:
* [[Savanna]] villages, where they appear in tables, animal pen, butcher and shepherd house, stilt house buildings, and other buildings.
* [[Shipwreck]]s{{only|BE|short=1}}

; {{BlockSprite|Dark Oak Fence|text=Dark oak}}
Dark oak fences generate as part of:
* [[Mineshaft]]s generated in [[badlands]] biomes, as the supports.
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s
* [[Pillager outpost]]s, as part of watchtower, tent, cage, and scarecrow.
* [[Ancient cities]]

== Usage ==
{{main|Fence#Usage}}
Wooden fences have the same usages as nether brick fences to form barriers and attaching mobs with a lead.

=== Barrier ===
[[File:FenceConnectivity.png|thumb|right|Fences and Nether brick fences connected by fence gates. Notice that they do not form a connection directly between the two types of fences (in the middle).]]
Wooden fences connect to other wooden fences, but do not connect to Nether brick fences. However, Nether brick fences connect to wooden [[fence gate]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-197992}}</ref>

=== Fuel ===
Overworld wooden fences can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Note blocks ===
Wooden fences can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sound.

== Sounds ==
