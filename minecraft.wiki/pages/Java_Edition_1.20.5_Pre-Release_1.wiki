* Added <code>set_custom_model_data</code>.
** Sets <code>custom_model_data</code> component.
** Fields:
*** <code>conditions</code> - list of conditions to filter this function.
*** <code>value</code> - integer number provider.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added Entity Type tag <code>minecraft:punchable_projectiles</code> for projectiles which should be able to be punched and deflected toward the direction the player is looking.
* Added Enchantment tag <code>minecraft:tooltip_order</code> controlling which order Enchantments are listed in tooltips.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Written book]]'''
* The limit on the amount of pages for a written book has been removed.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Effect]]s'''<ref>{{bug|MC-270954|||Won't Fix}}</ref>
* [[Infested]]
** Now has a 10% chance to spawn 1-2 silverfish instead of 5%.
** Silverfish now spawn at the center of the entity's bounding box and fling out in the direction the entity is facing.
* [[Oozing]]
** Only spawns slimes in a given 5x5x5 area up to the max entity cramming count.
* [[Weaving]]
** Now more consistently spawns 2-3 cobwebs on death.
** Players are now affected by the movement buff through cobwebs, affecting 50% of their normal speed instead of 25%.

=== Command format ===
'''Item sub-predicates'''
* General rules of component predicates:
** Unless otherwise specified, a field in predicate with the same name as a field in component that matches (i.e. has the same name as predicate) matches that field value
** Those fields usually have the same type as in the components, but are optional.
** Exceptions:
*** List fields are replaced with collection matchers (see below)
*** Integer and float fields are replaced with ranges
*** Registry ids are replaced with a type that accepts id, list of ids or a tag
* Collection matcher is a shared part of predicate used for matching collections. Every instance of this matcher has same fields with same functionality, with only difference being type of matched elementFields:
** <code>size</code> - integer range to match against collection size
** <code>contains</code> - a list of element predicates
*** All conditions must match for predicate to pass
*** Not all elements in tested container have to be matched
*** Elements can be in any order
*** Single element can match multiple predicates
*** Examples (when matching item stacks):
**** <code>{contents:[{item:diamond}]}</code> - matches when there is at least one diamond item
**** <code>{contents:[{item:diamond}, {item:dirt}]}</code> - matches when there is at least one diamond item and at least one dirt item
** <code>count</code> - a list of matchers on element counts
*** Entry fields:
**** <code>test</code> - element matcher
**** <code>count</code> - optional integer range to check against number of elements passing <code>test</code>
*** Examples (when matching item stacks):
**** <code>{count:[{count:3,test:{items:diamond}}]}}</code> matches only when there are exactly 3 stacks of diamonds (no matter the stack size)

'''Loot functions'''
* Changed <code>set_contents</code>.
** Unused field <code>type</code> has been removed
** Added new mandatory field <code>component</code>:
*** Describes target component to be filled with items
*** Existing contents are replaced
*** Allowed values: <code>container</code>, <code>bundle_contents</code>, <code>charged_projectiles</code>
*** <code>bundle_contents</code> and <code>charged_projectiles</code> ignore empty stacks
* Changed <code>set_custom_data</code>.
** Field <code>tag</code> now accepts both SNBT data written as a string (existing format) and unflattened tags.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* Data pack version is now <code>39</code>.
* Added new item sub-predicates.
* Added new terrain adaptation type for structures: <code>encapsulate</code>
** Density is added all around every piece of a structure
** Ideal for structures that need to be entirely covered underground
* The combination of <code>max_stack_size</code> and <code>max_damage</code> components is no longer allowed in commands and data pack definitions
* Added a new option <code>body</code> in entity <code>equipment</code> sub-predicate to match the item in the body armor slot of an entity
* The <code>saturation_modifier</code> field on the <code>food</code> component has been replaced with <code>saturation</code>
** <code>saturation</code> is the exact value added to the player's saturation level
** In respect to the former <code>saturation_modifier</code>, this is defined by <code>saturation = nutrition * saturation_modifier * 2</code>
* Changed optional <code>equipment_loot_table</code> field in the <code>SpawnPotentials</code> of Monster Spawners and <code>spawn_potentials</code> of Trial Spawner configs.
** Now named <code>equipment</code> instead of <code>equipment_loot_table</code>
** Format: object with fields
*** <code>loot_table</code> - A loot table used to generate the equipment
*** <code>slot_drop_chances</code> - An optional map of equipment slot to specified drop chance
**** Can also be a single value instead of a list to apply to all slots: e.g. <code>slot_drop_chances: 0.0f</code> applies a chance of 0% to all slots
** e.g. <code>equipment: {loot_table: "minecraft:equipment/trial_chamber", slot_drop_chances: {"head": 0.0f, "chest": 0.25f, "legs": 1.0f, "feet": 0.25f}}</code>
** If present, rolled items from the specified loot table are equipped to the mob that spawns.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added support for Viossa language.

'''[[Particle]]s'''
* Particle options in commands and in fields like <code>Particles</code> in Area Effect clouds now use the same representation as worldgen files (like existing biomes' ambient particle settings)
* For example, command <code>/particle minecraft:dust 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 ...</code> becomes <code>/particle minecraft:dust{color:[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], scale:2.0} ...</code>
* The syntax for particles without extra options (like <code>minecraft:villager</code>) remains unchanged
* Changes to block particles (<code>minecraft:block</code>, <code>minecraft:block_marker</code>, <code>minecraft:falling_dust</code>, <code>minecraft:dust_pillar</code>) options:
** Field <code>value</code> has been renamed to <code>block_state</code>
** Field <code>block_state</code> now also accepts plain block name to represent default block state
** Example transformations:
*** <code>minecraft:block minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=true]</code> -> <code>minecraft:block{block_state: {Name: "minecraft:redstone_lamp", Properties: {lit: "true"}}}</code>
*** <code>minecraft:block minecraft:diamond_block</code> -> <code>minecraft:block{block_state: "minecraft:diamond_block"}</code>
* Changes to <code>minecraft:item</code> options:
** Field <code>value</code> has been renamed to <code>item</code>
** Field <code>item</code> now also accepts plain item name to represent item stack with default components
** <code>count</code> field is now ignored
** Example transformations:
*** <code>minecraft:item minecraft:dirt</code> -> <code>minecraft:item{item: {id: "minecraft:dirt"}}</code>
*** <code>minecraft:item minecraft:dirt</code> -> <code>minecraft:item{item: "minecraft:dirt"}</code>
* Changes to <code>dust_color_transition</code> options:
** Field <code>fromColor</code> has been renamed to <code>from_color</code>
** Field <code>toColor</code> has been renamed to <code>to_color</code>
** Example transformation: <code>dust_color_transition 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.5</code> -> <code>dust_color_transition{from_color: [1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f], scale: 0.5f, to_color: [0.0f, 1.0f, 0.5f]}</code>
* Changes to <code>entity_effect</code> options:
** Field <code>value</code> has been renamed to <code>color</code>
** Field <code>color</code> now also accepts list of floats representing RGBA color
