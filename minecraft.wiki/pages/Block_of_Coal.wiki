A '''block of coal''', also known as a '''coal block''', is a storage block, equivalent to nine [[coal]], that can also be used as [[fuel]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Blocks of coal can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Blocks of coal can generate in [[trail ruins]].

=== Crafting ===
Blocks of coal can be crafted only from regular [[coal]], not [[charcoal]]. It is crafted in the same way as other mineral blocks.

== Usage ==
Blocks of coal are often used to store coal in a compact fashion, or otherwise used as a fairly cheap construction block.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Fuel ===
Blocks of coal can be used as fuel in a [[furnace]]. One block of coal lasts 800 seconds (16000 ticks), which smelts 80 items. This is ten times the duration of a single piece of coal and 1{{frac|1|9}} times as efficient (+11.11%) as nine individual pieces of coal, which would only smelt 72 items. The latter, however, prevents inactive furnace use; while smelting one item with one coal wastes seven potential items, smelting one item with one block of coal wastes 79 potential items.

=== Note blocks ===
Blocks of coal can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Blocks of coal cannot be used as fuel for the [[minecart with furnace]].
* A full stack of coal blocks should smelt for 14.2 hours – over 42 ''[[Minecraft]]'' days. That is over 50 times as many items as a [[lava bucket]]. However, the player needs 576 coal or 9 stacks of coal to do this.
