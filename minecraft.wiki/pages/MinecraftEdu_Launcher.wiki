== Launcher Settings ==
Launcher settings can be used to set your client RAM, launch or proxy settings. To change your launcher settings:

# Open MinecraftEdu Launcher
# Click "Client Settings" on top of the window.
# Click "Client Settings".

=== Basic Settings ===
Basic settings include how much RAM memory are you assigning for your game client and should launcher keep running in the background once your launch MinecraftEdu.

==== Client RAM ====
Default value: 700

This controls how much RAM memory is assigned to Minecraft Client. If client keeps crashing and states that there is not enough memory available, you should raise this value.

==== Keep Launcher Running in the Background ====
Should the launcher keep on running in the background once user launches MinecraftEdu.

=== Advanced Settings ===
Advanced settings contains troubleshooting mode option and ability to check for updates automatically.

==== Troubleshooting (debug) mode ====
If you are having problems with MinecraftEdu software and for ex. cannot launch the client, you can make the software to log all console messages into files. There are two ways to do that, depending on if you can or cannot launch MinecraftEdu Launcher.

'''NOTE: Debug mode is always enabled in 1.7.10 build 6 and later releases.'''

===== Enabling Troubleshooting mode if you can launch MinecraftEdu Launcher =====

# Start MinecraftEdu Launcher.
# Go to Client Settings -> Client Settings -> Advanced.
# Switch "Debug Mode" to On and press "Save Settings" from bottom.
# Restart MinecraftEdu Launcher.

===== Enabling Troubleshooting mode if you cannot launch MinecraftEdu Launcher =====

# Navigate to your minecraftedu/launcher_res/settings folder.
# Open file launchersettings.ini.
# Change option writedebuglogtofile to true. Option should then look like this: writedebuglogtofile=true. If this option is not there, you can append the option in the file.

===== Viewing log files =====
Navigate to your minecraftedu/debug folder. Inside there should be log files for all applications, for ex. client.log and launcher.log. Should you need to send these files out to TeacherGaming representative or for others to view, it is best to archive (zip) these files and attach the files in the email message.

==== Check for updates automatically ====
If this is checked, launcher will check for updates automatically when it starts and inform users about them.

=== Launch Settings ===
Through launch settings user can configure default alias, gender and add an IP address where client would automatically connect in when it launches.

==== Alias ====
Default nickname for a user.

==== Gender ====
Default gender for a user.

==== Connect automatically to given server ====
Type in here IP address where you would like client to connect into once it launches.

==== Try to login automatically ====
If this is enabled, client tries to instantly join a server when user presses the "Start MinecraftEdu" or "Start Minecraft" button.

=== Proxy Settings ===
If your school is behind a firewall, use these settings to define a proxy for the application.

==== Proxy Address ====
Proxy's address.

==== Proxy Port ====
Proxy's port.

==== Username ====
Should you need to use a username for your proxy, type it here.

==== Password ====
Should you need to use a password for your proxy, type it here.

'''Note:''' Password gets storen in a plaintext file.

==== Direct Connection Type ====
Default value: http

Direct connection is passed for Minecraft Client.

==== Global Connection Type ====
Default value: all

Global connection will be used for all other proxy connections in the application.

== Hidden Parameters ==
A '''hidden parameter''' is a line that ''isn't'' rendered in the settings file automatically. To take advantage of such a setting, the user must add the line to the file manually. This means that in an automatically generated launchersettings.ini file this line will not be present and therefore set to a default state that will not affect your gameplay; if you prefer a setting in its default state, it is much easier to leave it missing from the file. You can find launchersettings.ini file from <code>minecraftedu/launcher_res/settings/launchersettings.ini</code>

=== Hiding certain parts of the Launcher ===
You can use following settings to hide certain parts of the launcher.

==== Disabling whole top menu ====
 disable-launcher-top-menu=true

 disable-launcher-top-menu-file=true
