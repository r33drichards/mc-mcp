|-
| Estimated world size
| 8
|  A big-endian 64 bit integer representing the world size in bits{{verify}}
|-
| Last Played
| 4
| A big-endian 32 bit unix timestamp indicating when the level was last saved, will overflow and become negative at '''03:14:08 UTC on 19 January 2038''' due to [[wikipedia:Year 2038 problem|the year 2038 problem]] and will overflow every ~136 years after that.
|-

| 2
| A big-endian unsigned 16 bit integer
|-
| World Name
| Variable
| A [[wikipedia:Code_page_437|CP437]] encoded string<ref group="note">This is due to the font texture found in the assets folder of the apk, future versions may render non-ASCII characters differently</ref>

! Description
|-
| Header
| 8
| A little-endian 32 bit integer used to identify the version of the tool used to save the file, always 1 followed by a little-endian 32 bit integer that marks the size of the file subtract the header, always 80.
|-
| Pos X
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-
| Pos Y
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-

| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-
| Motion X
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-
| Motion Y
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-
| Motion Z
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-
| Pitch
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float, an error in the code causes this value to be read incorrectly
|-
| Yaw
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float representing the player's yaw in degrees
|-
| Unknown
| 4
| A little-endian 32 bit float
|-
| Fire
| 2
| A little-endian signed short representing the number of ticks until the fire is put out. Negative values reflect how long the player can stand in fire before burning. Default value: -20
|-
| Air
| 2
| A little-endian signed short representing how much air the player has, in ticks. Fills to a maximum of 300 in air. Decreases while underwater.{{verify}}

|-
| Hotbar
| 36
| 9 slots that take up 4 bytes each, the first two bytes is the item ID<ref group="note">Every items from Pocket Edition [[Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha|0.1.0]] to [[Pocket Edition v0.1.3 alpha|0.1.3]] has an ID only takes up 1 byte with the exception of [[Camera]], which takes 2 bytes (c8 01).</ref>. The other two bytes have unknown use and are always 0x00. The last slot is always saved as 0xFF for every byte, it's known to be a hotbar slot as the <code>minecraftpe</code> library loops through 9 hotbar slots.
