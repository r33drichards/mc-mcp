'''"Eleven"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Beta]]''.

== Track description ==
"Eleven" starts with the same record static as with [[Music Disc 11|music disc "11"]], but is abruptly interrupted by a record scratching sound and the song switches to a new, slow, calm piano piece, instead of the familiar, disturbing sounds from "11".

== Trivia ==
* "Eleven" is likely meant to be a bait-and-switch by C418, considering that it at first appears to be "11" due to its name, song length, and its inclusion on the same album as most of his other music discs, and that it even begins the same way, but then immediately turns out to be something completely different.
** It's possible that C418 chose not to include the original song in order to add to its mystery and possibly its obscurity, or because a sudden interlude of non-musical sound effects would have interrupted the flow of the album.
