'''[[Text component format]]'''
* Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string.
* The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure.
* For example, the item component <code>minecraft:custom_name="{"text":"Renamed item"}"</code> will become <code>minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}</code>.
* This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as {{cmd|tellraw}} or {{cmd|title}}.
** For example, {{cmd|tellraw @s '{"text":"Hello world"}'}} may become <code>tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}}</code>.
* Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in NBT, no distinction exists between boolean and integer types.
** To pass boolean arguments to translations, the string form must be used.
* For Text Components with the NBT type and interpret set to true, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to string and parsing as JSON.

* Hover Events
** The <code>hoverEvent</code> field has been renamed to <code>hover_event</code>.
** The legacy <code>value</code> field (which was parsed from a rendered text component) is no longer supported.

*** e.g. <code>{action:'show_text',contents:'Hello world'} becomes {action:'show_text',text:'Hello world'}</code>
** For the <code>show_item</code> action:
*** The <code>contents</code> field has been inlined.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'show_item',contents:{id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}} becomes {action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick',count:2}</code>
*** If contents was specified only as an item id, it is replaced with the full format and inlined.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'show_item',contents:'minecraft:stick'}</code> becomes <code>{action:'show_item',id:'minecraft:stick'}</code>
** For the <code>show_entity</code> action:
*** The <code>contents</code> field has been inlined.
*** The <code>id</code> field has been renamed to <code>uuid</code>.
*** The <code>type</code> field has been renamed to <code>id</code>.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'show_entity',contents:{id:[I;0,0,0,0],type:'minecraft:pig'}} becomes {action:'show_entity',uuid:[I;0,0,0,0],id:'minecraft:pig'}</code>

* Click Events
** The <code>clickEvent</code> field has been renamed to <code>click_event</code>
** For the <code>open_url</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>url</code>
*** The click event will no longer parse if not a valid URI with either <code>https://</code> or <code>http://</code> schemes, instead of simply not working.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'open_url',value:'https://minecraft.net'} becomes {action:'open_url',url:'https://minecraft.net'}</code>
** For the <code>open_file</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>path</code>
** For the <code>run_command</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>command</code>.
*** The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working.
*** It is no longer required that the specified command field has a <code>/</code> prefix.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'run_command',value:'/say Hi'} becomes {action:'run_command',command:'/say Hi'}</code>.
** For the <code>suggest_command</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>command</code>.
*** The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'} becomes {action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}</code>
** For the <code>change_page</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>page</code>.
*** The page value now requires a positive integer instead of a string.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'change_page',value:'1'} becomes {action:'change_page',page:1}</code>
** The <code>copy_to_clipboard</code> format is unchanged.
