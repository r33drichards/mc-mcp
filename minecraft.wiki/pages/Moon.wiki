[[File:Moon Phases.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The moon, showing its phases (viewed on the eastern sky)]]

The '''moon''' is a celestial body that appears in the night [[sky]] in the Overworld.

== Nighttime ==
{{main|Daylight cycle}}

[[Nighttime]] begins after the [[sun]] has fully set in the west and the moon has risen in the east. As time passes, the moon moves westward across the sky. Overall, [[nighttime]] lasts about 7 minutes (in real-time). [[Player]]s can track the moon's position in the sky using a [[clock]].

During the night, the moon illuminates the surface in the same manner as the [[sun]]; however, [[light]] levels fall to a minimum of four.
[[File:Moonlight Vibrant Visuals.png|thumb|Moonlight with Vibrant Visuals.]]
With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the moon is considered a directional light source, which can create pixelated shadows and bright reflections on [[water]] and smooth textures. A pixelated blue glow appears around the moon depending on the moon phase.

The moon is not visible during [[precipitation]], even in dry biomes {{in|je}}. Disabling "Beautiful Skies" {{in|be}} (Simple or Fancy [[graphics]]) completely hides the moon. The moon also disappears in ''Bedrock Edition'' during daytime, where it is still visible below the void in ''Java Edition''.

[[Grass block]]s and [[sapling]]s do not grow in moonlight, nor do they decay. To grow them at night requires the use of light sources such as [[torch]]es. On the other hand, [[crops]] can continue to grow with sufficient [[client light]], even if not lit up by torches.{{Only|short=1|Java}}

Nighttime can be skipped entirely using a [[bed]], provided there are no monsters nearby.

=== Stars ===
Together with the moon, the night sky also consists of [[star]]s. Stars appear as bright points, and the starfield rotates with the moon, rising in the east and descending in the west, as the night progresses.

== Phases ==
[[File:moon.png|thumb|right|The full moon phase]]

The moon is always opposite of the sun, but still goes through eight [[Wikipedia:Lunar phase|lunar phases]], and changes phase at the end of every sunrise. This allows the player to keep rough track of the passage of time, even after spending a few game days underground.

The phases of the moon are (in chronological order as they appear in-game, which are in the direction of real moon phases in the southern hemisphere except in {{BE}} where it's in reverse):

# {{EnvSprite|full-moon|scale=2}} Full Moon
# {{EnvSprite|waning-gibbous-moon|scale=2}} Waning Gibbous
# {{EnvSprite|last-quarter-moon|scale=2}} Third Quarter
# {{EnvSprite|waning-crescent-moon|scale=2}} Waning Crescent
# {{EnvSprite|new-moon|scale=2}} New Moon
# {{EnvSprite|waxing-crescent-moon|scale=2}} Waxing Crescent
# {{EnvSprite|first-quarter-moon|scale=2}} First Quarter
# {{EnvSprite|waxing-gibbous-moon|scale=2}} Waxing Gibbous

The pixels of the first quarter phase moon and waxing gibbous moon present a more rounded, organic shape than the corresponding waning phase moons that show a more squared-off appearance. It can help a player in timing a slime hunt in a swamp (see below).

There is no explicit [[command]] to change the moon's phase, but using {{cmd|time add 24000}} advances time by one day toward the next phase. To go back one phase, using {{cmd|time add 168000}} advances time by 7 days, which is one full lunar cycle minus one moon phase.

There is an equation to calculate the moon phase on any given day in Minecraft: <code>phase = (day mod 8) + 1</code>. The day can be found in the [[Debug screen|F3 screen]] {{in|java}}, or by enabling the "Show days played" [[Create_New_World#Advanced|world setting]] {{in|bedrock}}, and the phase matches to the list shown above.

=== Effects on mobs ===
{{see also|Difficulty#Moon phase|Difficulty#Regional difficulty}}
[[File:SlimesAtNight.png|thumb|right|250px|Slimes spawning in a swamp during the full moon (view of eastern sky; moon rising)]]

The phase of the moon has three subtle effects on mob spawning:

* The number of [[slime]]s that spawn in [[swamp]]s is proportional to the moon's fullness: They are most numerous during the full moon and none spawn during the new moon. (The moon's phase does not influence the normal spawning of slimes in designated chunks at [[altitude]]s below y=40.)
* The moon phase affects the [[regional difficulty]], increasing the chance that (1) [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s have the ability to pick up items and spawn with weapons and armor, (2) their natural equipment is [[enchanted]], and (3) any equipment enchantments are higher. Regional difficulty also gives [[spider]]s a greater chance to spawn with random beneficial [[status effect]]s, including invisibility{{only|java}} in Hard [[difficulty]]. All of these effects combine with the world's difficulty, and higher difficulty levels increase the chance of mob buffs.
* Only during a full moon, black [[cat]]s have a 1/11 chance of spawning.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* One ''Minecraft'' lunar cycle (from full moon to full moon) takes 2 hours and 40 minutes of playtime. This means there are approximately 9 lunar cycles in one real-world day (24 hours) of play.
* There is a patch of the full moon that is off color, being {{color|#606978}} instead of {{color|#60687A}}. This can be found 1 4×4 patch above the bottom right corner.
