A '''potato''' is a [[food]] [[item]] obtained from potato crops that can be used to plant them, consumed raw or [[cook]]ed to make [[baked potato]]es.

'''Potato crops''' are planted in [[farmland]] and used to grow potatoes and, rarely, [[Poisonous Potato|poisonous potatoes]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Fortune#Seeds}}

Fully grown potato crops drop 2 to 5 potatoes ({{frac|3|5|7}} per crop harvested on average) and have a 2% chance of dropping an additional [[poisonous potato]]. Potato yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with [[Fortune]], with Fortune III harvesting an average of {{frac|5|3|7}} potatoes. [[Bone meal]] can be used to mature the potato to its last stage of growth.

The first two potatoes always drop, and then three more attempts are made to drop a potato with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0–3 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.
{{breaking row|Potatoes|link=none|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[Village]] farm plots have a chance of being planted with potatoes. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:

{| class="wikitable"
! Village style !! Chance
|-
| {{EnvSprite|snowy-village}} Snowy || 70%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|plains-village}} Plains || 15%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|taiga-village}} Taiga || 10%
|}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, and [[zombie villager]]s have a 2.5% ({{frac|1|40}}) chance of dropping either an [[iron ingot]], [[carrot]], or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% ({{frac|1|100}}) per level of looting. This gives potatoes the following chances of dropping:
* {{frac|1|120}} (about 0.83%)
* {{frac|7|600}} (about 1.17%) with Looting I
* {{frac|9|600}} (1.50%) with Looting II
* {{frac|11|600}} (about 1.83%) with Looting III

{{IN|java}}, when killed with fire, a zombie drops a [[baked potato]] instead.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|potato}}

== Usage ==

=== Farming ===
{{main|Tutorial:Crop farming}}
When farmed, potatoes go through 8 [[Block tick|stages]] of growth. However, there are four ''apparent'' stages because the texture only changes upon reaching stages 1, 3, 5, and 8 with stage 8 being the final, mature appearance.

Potatoes require a [[Light|light level]] of 8 or greater to plant{{only|java}} and 9 or greater to grow. {{IN|bedrock}} they can be planted at any light level, but need an [[Light#Internal light level|internal light level]] of 9 to grow. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is [[Farmland#Hydration|hydrated]]. Using [[bone meal]] on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.

Crops break if pushed by a [[piston]] or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

=== Food ===
To eat a potato, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the [[hotbar]]. Eating a potato restores {{hunger|1}} hunger and 0.6 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Breeding ===
[[Pig]]s follow and can be [[bred]] by a player holding a potato.

[[Villager]]s can pick up potato items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 potatoes to become willing.

=== Smelting ingredient ===
{{Smelting
|showname=1
|Potato
|Baked Potato
|0.35
}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a potato into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1, less than composting with [[baked potato]]es, which has a higher success chance of 85%.
