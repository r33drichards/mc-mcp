== Usage ==
Blocks of emerald can be used to store [[emerald]]s in a compact fashion or used as decorative blocks.

=== Beacons ===
Blocks of emerald can be used to "power" a [[beacon]]. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of emerald blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7, and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely emerald blocks, as they may also contain [[blocks of iron]], [[blocks of gold]], [[blocks of netherite]], and [[blocks of diamond]].

=== Note blocks ===
A block of emerald can be used underneath a [[note block]] to produce the "bit" sound.
