'''14w29a''' is the thirty-sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on July 16, 2014.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722120942/https://mojang.com/2014/07/minecraft-snapshot-14w29a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w29b|date=July 16, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Searge]]}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|489436626171342848|Snapshot 14w29a is now available. We successfully bent space around time and got a performance boost out of it:|July 16, 2014}}</ref>
This snapshot contains a lot of optimizations specifically targeting render performance.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''Gamerules'''
* <code>reducedDebugInfo</code>
** Gamerule to enable/disable reduced information on the F3 [[debug screen]].
** Op-only unlike the 'Reduced debug info' toggle in multiplayer settings.
** Overrides 'reduced debug info' settings in clients.
* The ability to create gamerule variables.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2aw5nh/new_queryresults_and_gamerule_variables/</ref>
** These are dummy gamerules which don't actually affect the world, but can be used with {{cmd|stats}} with the new <code>QueryResults</code> argument to update a scoreboard objective based on the value of that gamerule.
** Declare using {{cmd|gamerule <newRuleName> <value>}}.
** Access using {{cmd|gamerule <newRuleName>}}.

=== Options ===
'''Multiplayer settings'''
* 'Reduced debug info' toggle to enable/disable reduced information on the F3 [[debug screen]].

'''Video settings'''
* 'Use VBOs' toggle to enable/disable vertex buffer objects.
* Offers a ~10% performance increase when set to ON.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Beacon]]s, [[bed]]s, [[chest]]s, [[ender chest]]s, [[head]]s, [[sign]]s'''
* Now display the cracking animation.
** [[Bed]]s did display the cracking animation previously, but not on their top and bottom.

'''[[Stairs]]'''
* Flipped inventory texture back to original orientation.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Ore]] generation'''
* More than twice as fast.<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|488715162086813696|According to my profiler, generating 30k chunks of ore took 215ms before and now only takes 96ms.|July 14, 2014}}</ref>

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|particle}}'''
* Additionally has a <code>force</code> argument after the <code>count</code> which can be set to <code>normal</code> or <code>force</code>.
* This forces particles to show even if the player's 'Particle' toggle is set to minimal or decreased.

'''{{cmd|time}}'''
* {{cmd|time query <value>}} argument to check the time.
** Has an another argument after that which can be <code>daytime</code> or <code>gametime</code> to check either the number of ticks since the start of the day or the number of ticks since the world was created, respectively.

'''{{cmd|worldborder}}'''
* {{cmd|worldborder get}} argument to see the current size of the border.

'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* Sidebar is now also secondarily sorted by alphabetical order on the name.
