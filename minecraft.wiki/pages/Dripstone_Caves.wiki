'''Dripstone caves''' are cave [[biome]]s found in inland areas, filled with clusters and pillars of [[pointed dripstone]] and [[dripstone blocks]].

== Description ==
[[File:Large dripstone.png|thumb|x200px|A dripstone cluster.]]
Dripstone caves generate underground at any [[altitude]] beneath areas with high [[continentalness]] values (≥ 0.8), which means they are usually found far inland, and are essentially never found under [[ocean]] biomes or bordering a coast. While [[dark forest]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, [[bamboo jungle]]s, [[wooded badlands]], and [[taiga]]s at temperatures of -0.450 and below are almost guaranteed to have [[lush caves]] under them, dripstone caves may generate under them instead of lush caves when they're far inland. 

A dripstone cave looks similar to a regular cave, but [[dripstone block]]s and [[pointed dripstone]] both hanging as stalactites and growing from the ground as stalagmites generate throughout the biome, with small [[water]] wells of 1×1 blocks also commonly generated all over the biome. Large [[dripstone cluster]]s structures occasionally generate inside ravines. This biome also generates larger copper ore [[ore (feature)|blobs]] compared to other biomes. {{IN|java|}}, [[drowned]] and rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es are able to spawn in aquifers, unlike in other biomes. [[Mineshaft]]s, [[amethyst geode]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[trial chambers]] and [[Glow Lichen (feature)|glow lichen]] can be found in dripstone caves like normal, and [[stronghold]]s and [[woodland mansions]]{{Only|be|short=1}} also rarely generate.

When exposed to the surface, the surface is made entirely out of stone with occasional patches of dripstone.
