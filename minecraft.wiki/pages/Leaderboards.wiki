[[File:Leaderboards Traveling Normal.jpg|thumb|The traveling leaderboard showcases how much distance players travel by walking, falling, using minecarts, and boats.]]

'''Leaderboards''' are a [[Legacy Console Edition]] exclusive where one can keep track of their progress with their friends or other players on the same console type as theirs.

There are six types of leaderboards:{{info needed|missing glide score attack and glide time attack leaderboards.}}
<!--- outside of this list, please use normal capitalization for leaderboard types --->
* '''Traveling Leaderboard''', which tracks the [[distance]] players have traveled, calculated in meters. It also tracks the distance traveled using [[minecart]]s and [[boat]]s, and the highest distance players have fallen.{{verify|the highest or the total distance players have fallen?}}
* '''Kills Leaderboard''', which tracks how many [[entities]] players have killed. The entities tracked are mostly [[monster]]s, such as [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[spider]]s, [[spider jockey]], [[zombie pigmen]], and [[slime]]s.
* '''Mining Blocks Leaderboard''', which tracks how many [[block]]s players have mined. The blocks tracked are [[dirt]], [[cobblestone]], [[sand]], [[stone]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and [[obsidian]].
* '''Farming Leaderboard''', which tracks how many [[Farming|farm]] items players have collected. The items tracked are [[egg]]s, [[wheat]], [[mushroom]]s, [[sugar cane]], and [[milk bucket]]s.{{info needed|there is one last farm item in the leaderboard that shows an image of pickaxe, what is it?}}
* '''Glide Leaderboard''', which can be filtered with score and time attack. {{info needed}}

Leaderboards' players can be filtered by "Overall" (which show global player leaderboard), "Friends", and "My Score".{{info needed|what does my score filter do? Lolo's response: idk, has been broken for years}}
