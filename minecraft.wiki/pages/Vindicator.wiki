A '''vindicator''' is an [[illager]] equipped with an [[iron axe]]. Vindicators spawn in [[woodland mansion]]s and participate in [[raid]]s. They [[sprint]] toward their targets to attack them with their axe.

== Spawning ==
On Normal [[difficulty]] and Hard difficulty, vindicators sometimes spawn with a randomly enchanted iron [[axe]]: the chance is 0–25%, and is higher when the [[regional difficulty]] is higher.

=== Woodland mansions ===
Vindicators spawn during the generation of [[woodland mansion]]s, in groups of 1–3 inside particular rooms, sometimes accompanied by an [[evoker]]. They spawn on all 3 floors. Rarely, vindicators can spawn in the corridors and hallways. 

They do not respawn after initially spawning. Vindicators generated in woodland mansions do not despawn.

Vindicators are sometimes neutral if naturally spawned in a woodland mansion, which means that the vindicator does not attack the player on sight, but only after the player attacks it.

=== Patrols ===
{{main|Patrol}}
{{IN|java}}, any vindicators can join a [[patrol]] if sufficiently near a [[patrol captain]], but do not go seeking out for patrols to join nor do they naturally spawn in a patrol.

=== Raids ===
{{main|Raid}}
Vindicators can spawn during [[raid]]s. They appear more frequently during later waves and at higher difficulties.

Vindicators that spawn from raids have a chance to spawn with [[Sharpness]] I on their axe, or Sharpness II in waves 6 and up. This replaces the usual chance of a random enchantment.

Vindicators can spawn riding [[ravager]]s, creating a [[Ravager Jockey|vindicator ravager jockey]].{{only|java|short=y}}

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{IN|java}}, if a player spawns a vindicator with a spawn egg or using a command, the vindicator has a chance of becoming an [[illager captain]], with an [[ominous banner]] attached above its back.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===

== Behavior ==
[[File:Vindication.png|thumb|A vindicator captain chasing a [[villager]].|alt=]]
Vindicators are hostile toward [[player]]s, [[iron golem]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, and [[snow golem]]s.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}

While idle, a vindicator crosses its arms similar to a [[villager]], with its axe stowed. While giving chase, the vindicator brandishes its axe and [[sprints]]. If it has no weapons, a mainhand-unarmed vindicator raises both of its hands when attacking.

On Normal and Hard difficulties, vindicators that are part of a raid can break [[wooden door]]s. This is controlled by the <code>raider</code> [[NBT format|tag]].<ref>{{bug|MC-255749|Non-raider vindicator cannot chop down wooden doors.}}</ref> Like any illager during a raid, vindicators celebrate by cheering if all the villagers are killed or all the [[bed]]s are destroyed.

All illagers remain friendly to each other, even when struck accidentally.

Vindicators flee from [[creaking]]s when within 8 blocks of them.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
Vindicators are likely to call help from other vindicators when attacked by mobs (except for illagers and [[goat]]s, or if they were killed in one hit), inciting them all to attack the aggressor. They do not call help from other kinds of illagers.

Vindicator raiders, in addition to breaking doors, can also open [[Wooden Door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s like villagers.

Ringing a [[bell]] gives all vindicators within 32 blocks the {{EffectLink|Glowing}} effect for 3 seconds.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Vindicators can only sprint, even when idle.

A [[dispenser]] can equip a vindicator with armor, but it is invisible and does not show on its model.

=== Damage ===
Armed vindicators hit for {{hp|7.5}} to {{hp|19.5}} damage, depending on [[difficulty]]. They tie with [[piglin brute]]s for dealing the fourth most melee damage in the game, following the [[iron golem]] at {{hp|21.5}} damage, the [[warden]] at {{hp|30}} damage, and the [[giant]] at {{hp|50}} damage, all on Normal difficulty. Unless named "Johnny", vindicators are the only illagers that do not cause mobs to retaliate against it.

The vindicator's axe attack disables the player's [[shield]] for 5 seconds, even when riding a [[ravager]].

=== "Johnny" ===
A vindicator named ''Johnny'' (using a [[name tag]], named [[spawn egg]], etc., or has its <code>Johnny</code> tag set to <code>1b</code>) is hostile to [[armor stand]]s{{only|BE|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-51000}}, {{bug|MC-108480}}</ref>, [[camera]]s{{only|BE|short=1}}, [[player]]s in [[Adventure]] or [[Survival]] mode and all mobs except [[agent]]s, [[evoker]]s, [[ghast]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-169556}}</ref>, [[illusioner]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, other vindicators, and [[pillager]]s. This includes baby [[villager]]s{{only|be|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-141939|||WF}}</ref>, [[creakings]] (although it flees from it before it can attack), [[creeper]]s, [[ravager]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-137799|||WAI}}</ref>, [[vex]]es<ref>{{bug|MC-108403|||WAI}}</ref>, and [[witch]]es.<ref>{{bug|MC-141200}}</ref> Vexes or witches do not attack "Johnny" vindicators unless provoked by vindicators.

"Johnny" vindicators also attempt to attack the [[ender dragon]], but the ender dragon does not take damage.

Most hostile or neutral mobs try to attack the "Johnny" vindicator in return. Exceptions are: 
* mobs that die in one hit (e.g. [[bee]]s, [[endermite]]s);
* [[ender dragon]]s and [[phantom]]s, as those only attack players (the ender dragon deals damage to all mobs that touch it, but this is not considered an attack);
* [[goat]]s (apart from their usual ramming behavior);
* [[slime]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[ravager]]s, [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s.

The <code>Johnny</code> tag overrides its name; the player can give the vindicator any other name and set the <code>Johnny</code> tag to <code>1b</code> and it remains hostile in the same way as described. Conversely, the player can name the vindicator ''"''Johnny''"'' and set the <code>Johnny</code> tag to <code>0b</code>, causing the vindicator to act as a normal vindicator.

{{IN|java}}, using a [[name tag]] to rename a "Johnny" vindicator does not reset its <code>Johnny</code> tag, and it continues to exhibit "Johnny" behavior.

{{IN|bedrock}}, naming a vindicator spawn egg "Johnny" and {{Ctrl|using}} it on a [[monster spawner]] has no effect; normal vindicators spawn rather than vindicators named "Johnny".

During a [[raid]],  "Johnny" vindicator raid captains sometimes tell a [[ravager]] or [[witch]] to attack itself and the mob does so until it dies.{{only|je}}<ref>{{bug|MC-268709||Ravagers and witches attack themselves when a "Johnny" patrol leader is nearby}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The "Johnny" Easter egg is a reference to the 1980 movie ''[[wikipedia:The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', where a troubled man possessed by evil spirits in an isolated, haunted, labyrinthine, mansion-like hotel attacks his family with an axe, and says the iconic line "Here's Johnny!" while breaking a door down.
** Similarly, the movements of the vindicators in ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'' were also inspired by the film.
* According to the ''[[Mobestiary]]'', while a vindicator is stronger than a zombie, it still has low intelligence, 'a little smarter than a [[skeleton]]' (note that vindicators cannot use [[bow]]s in-game).
