'''''Minecraft: Pi Edition''''' is a cut down version of {{el|pe}} [[Pocket Edition v0.6.1 alpha|v0.6.1 alpha]] developed for the {{w|Raspberry Pi}}. It was intended as an educational tool for novice programmers and contains a revised feature set and support for multiple programming languages. As {{w|Raspberry Pi}} hardware was relatively slow at the time, this edition also served as a way to play ''Minecraft'' on the platform.

Although officially discontinued, it is [https://minecraft.net/edition/pi still available to download for free] and was also preinstalled in default installations of {{w|Raspberry Pi OS}}. Potential users are encouraged to interact with the game using an {{w|API}}.<ref>{{tweet|danfrisk|272323992097009665|Minecraft Pi edition will be free, it's a slightly cut-down version of PE. With added api.|24 Nov 2012}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
''Pi Edition'' was very similar to {{el|pe}} in many ways. Like older versions of ''Bedrock Edition'', only 256×256×128-block [[old]] worlds could be generated. The [[player]]'s [[skin]] is always [[Steve]]. The title and the world selection screens were identical until ''Pocket Edition'' updated to [[Pocket Edition v0.7.0 alpha|''Pocket Edition'' v0.7.0 alpha]].

The player has the ability to [[sneak]] but cannot [[sprint]]. [[Mobs]] do not spawn, even though the player starts with an [[iron sword]] in the [[hotbar]]. A bow is also available, but when used, the player holds the bow back indefinitely until they select another item or exit the world.

''Pi Edition'' includes all blocks from [[Pocket Edition v0.6.1 alpha|''Pocket Edition'' v0.6.1 alpha]]. The only game mode is [[Creative|creative mode]] and there is no crafting or smelting.

== Changes From ''Pocket Edition'' ==
* [[Survival mode]] is disabled and survival mode servers cannot be joined.
** Existing Survival mode worlds can still be opened, though certain parts of game logic behave like Creative mode.
* The {{w|Xperia Play}} UI is used instead of the touch UI.
* [[Sign]]s are are always blank when placed and cannot be edited without external tools.
* There is no option to select the world name or [[Seed (world generation)|seed]]. {{Cd|world}} is the default name.
** The world is always visible over a LAN connection and this setting cannot be changed in the pause menu.
* When playing in a [[multiplayer]] world, there is no option to quit and copy the map in the pause menu.
** The world is still saved as {{Cd|_LastJoinedServer}} in the worlds folder, but it will not show up in the select world screen unless it is renamed.
* A custom cursor is used instead of the default cursor.
* The language file has been updated from v0.6.1 alpha.{{more info|What exactly was changed?}}
* There is no [[sound]], despite the presence of a mute button in the pause menu.

== Development ==
=== Release ===
''Minecraft: Pi Edition'' was originally announced on the [[Mojang Studios]] website on November 24, 2012.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121127035644/http://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-is-coming-to-the-raspberry-pi/ Minecraft is coming to Raspberry Pi!] - Mojang.com; November 24, 2012</ref>
There was a compiled build labeled 0.1 on the Mojang repository, albeit encrypted until the game's launch in February 2013, making it inaccessible. When it was first uploaded, however, it was unprotected for a short amount of time, allowing for the download of the game before its true release. On December 20, 2012, [[Mojang Studios]] released a post on their official site announcing the release of ''Pi Edition''. However, it was promptly removed and no game release was made.

''Minecraft: Pi Edition'' was publicly released in Alpha on February 11, 2013, as version 0.1.1, and the previous release announcement post was restored.<ref name="available_for_download" /> However, the ''Pi Edition'' website still lists its post date as December 20, 2012.

=== Addition to Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) ===
On September 15, 2014, the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced that ''Minecraft: Pi Edition'' would be installed by default with their new versions of [[wikipedia:Raspberry_Pi_OS|Raspberry Pi OS]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspbian-and-noobs-releases|title=New Raspbian and NOOBS releases|website=Raspberry Pi Blog|author=Eben Upton|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref>

=== Discontinuation ===
''Pi Edition'' never received any subsequent updates, and its developers gave no further insights as to whether they were still developing the version. When brought up to [[Tommaso Checchi]] on Reddit on January 25, 2016, he stated the following:
{{q|The original team has stopped supporting it and starting with 0.9 MCPE became a lot more ambitious technically, which also means that it became a lot harder to strip down to run on a Raspberry Pi. Actually, we finished removing all Pi related code to reduce complexity in 2015.
Maybe someday we'll revisit it but I wouldn't hold my breath :P

On the other hand, Win10 runs on the Pi so you can run the Win10 version there! ... I guess it's something|Tommaso Checci|the discontinuation of ''Pi Edition''<ref>{{reddit|42g9cr/is_minecraft_pi_edition_no_longer_being_developed|cza7seq|sub=MCPE|title=Is Minecraft: Pi Edition no longer being developed or will there still be updates?|author=MinecraftOnXP|date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>}}In August 2021, when Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye was released to the public, Pi Edition was officially removed from both the Games Folder and the Recommended Software page because Bullseye dropped support for the graphics API that Pi Edition depended upon.<ref>[https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/133145/bullseye-e-unable-to-locate-package-minecraft-pi raspbian - Bullseye: E: Unable to locate package minecraft-pi - Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange]</ref> The game is still playable by using a previous version of the operating system. Fortunately, due to advancements in {{w|Raspberry Pi}} hardware, both {{JE}} and {{BE}} are playable on a {{w|Raspberry Pi}}, albeit potentially requiring some tweaking, depending on the [[w:Raspberry_Pi#Series_and_generations|Raspberry Pi model]] being used.

== Trivia ==
* The player's name is always "StevePi."
* Although there is no survival mode by default, the player can still die by falling in the [[void]].
* All mobs for {{el|pe}} v0.6.1 alpha are still in the game's code but they can only be spawned by loading a {{el|pe}} map with mobs or by using a nether reactor in a survival map.
* You can download mods to get Survival Mode, as well as other disabled features.<ref>[https://minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-editions/minecraft-pi-edition/1960005 Survival Mode Patch] – [https://minecraftforum.net/members/Phirel Phirel]</ref>

=== Technical ===
* You can change the player's skin by editing {{cd|data/images/mob/char.png}}.
* It can be re-textured by replacing files in the {{cd|data}} folder like {{cd|data/images/terrain.png}} and {{cd|data/images/gui/items.png}}.
** When using the {{w|Raspberry Pi OS}} package, the {{cd|data}} folder is located at {{cd|/opt/minecraft-pi/data}}.
* Instead of the normal creative mode, ''Minecraft: Pi Edition'' internally uses a "Creator Mode" which appears to be identical except for the API's checkpoints. This is hard-coded, even if the world or server has its data set to survival mode.
* Unlike ''Pocket Edition'' v0.6.1 alpha, ''Pi Edition'' has its symbols stripped, something ''Minecraft: Pocket Edition'' did not do until [[Bedrock Edition 1.13.0]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/MisteFr/status/1168596469621952515 "THEY REMOVED THE SYMBOLS"]  – [https://twitter.com/MisteFr @MisteFr]</ref>
* The file {{cd|data/lang/en_US.lang}} is included despite the code to load it not being implemented.
* It uses Raspberry Pi-specific GPU code preventing it from being easily emulated without modding.
* Textures for [[Fancy graphics|Fancy]] [[leaves]] and [[clouds]] are included despite Fancy Graphics being impossible to enable without patching.
* The scripting API's Java port includes a class called {{cd|pi.Item}} despite the API having no means to interact with items.
* Most disabled features are still present in the code like Survival Mode, the Pocket Edition v0.6.1 alpha touch UI, mob attacking, Fancy Graphics, [[mob spawning]], and [[bow]] firing.
* It only links against OpenGL ES 2 despite requiring OpenGL ES 1.
