== Synopsis ==
{{quote|
The official ''Minecraft'' Annual 2019 is a celebration of ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s Year of Building. Inside you’ll find build ideas, fun activities and a showcase of the ''Minecraft'' community's most impressive community builds. You'll also hear from expert build team [[Blockworks]], and the Mojang team have some build challenges for you to try, too.

It's almost enough to keep Minecrafters busy for an entire year.
