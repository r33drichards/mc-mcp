'''22w43a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.3]], released on October 26, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w43a|October 26, 2022}}</ref> which introduces chat report drafting, makes additional tweaks to creative inventory organization, and fixes bugs.

'''[[Chat]]'''

*** The draft is always kept if the screen was forcefully closed (e.g. player dying).
** Draft reports are kept until the player leaves the current server or world.
*** When leaving, the player is prompted to either discard or finish and send the report.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Nahuatl.<ref group=note>Also available for versions since [[22w42a]].</ref>
* Added Rusyn.<ref group=note>Also available for versions since [[21w37a]].</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Oak Fence Gate JE4 BE3.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Fence Gate|Fence Gates]]'''
* No longer provide center support beneath them.
** For example, hanging signs can no longer be placed under fence gates.
