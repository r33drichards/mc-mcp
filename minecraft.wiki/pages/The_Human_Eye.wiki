{{Quote|Can you see the possibilities?

To cover content standards such as "Explain how the human eye sees objects and colors in terms of wavelengths" educators have students create models of the human eye. Not only can you use this world as inspiration, but think about how groups of students can create the digestive system or other parts or organs of the human body to bring biology to life.|education.minecraft.net description}}

'''The Human Eye''' is a ''[[Minecraft Education]]'' map designed to teach ophthalmology. It can also be played through the [[Marketplace]].

== Summary ==
[[File:Human Eye first shot.png|thumb]]
The map begins with the player on a platform made of [[stained glass]], in the shape of an eye. To the west is a [[dark oak sign]], instructing the player to fly, and to the south is a [[chest]]. Inside the chest are several copies of a [[book]], ''The Human Eye'' by Willie C. Hugh, which is also in the player's [[inventory]] by default.

In the distance is a large model of a human eye, over a grid  of several [[glowstone]] blocks. The entrance is pointed to by a large [[red concrete]] arrow, itself below the word enter. Above the entrance is a sign, labeled "Enter the eye's Vitreous Chamber It is where vision gets made." The interior of the eye is predominately [[blocks of quartz]] and [[chiseled red sandstone]], lighten up by glowstone. In the center is a glowstone cluster in a straight line, identified by a sign as representing light entering into the eye, focused by the cornea, restricted by the iris, passing through the pupil, and finally focused into the lens. Another set of signs explain that the walls are the retina, and then a third says the end of the line is the macula, represented by [[blocks of emerald]] and a single piece of [[ice]] for the fovea. Surrounding the macula are signs explaining how it, the fovea, and retina work, while the end of the glowstone line explains that real eyes are full of vitreous humor.

To the right of the entrance is an optic nerve, represented by [[blocks of lapis lazuli]] and [[blocks of redstone]]. Three signs explain that it carries information to the brain and leaves a small, blind spot on the eye. At the bottom of the eye is a pool of [[water]] on top of glowstone, with signs on [[glass]] explain vitreous humor. Beside the signs are a [[torch]]. The lens of the eye is represented by a ball of glass, with two signs on the left side, and a second, diagonal line of glowstone to the right, representing inversion. Surrounding the lens are ciliary body muscles, consisting of [[red terracotta]], explained as manipulating the lens. Above the lens are signs explaining the use of [[nether quartz ore]] between the two layers, representing suspensory ligament zonules.

Through the pupil players can see additional signs, however they must be outside the eye to read them. Inside the anterior chamber is a pool of aqueous humor, said to maintain the shape of the eye. The iris is made out of [[blocks of diamond]], with a second diagonal line of light appearing beside it. Players can enter the anterior chamber from a small hole in the top, marked by a sign.
