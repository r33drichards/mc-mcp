'''Weeping vines''' are climbable, downwards-growing vegetation blocks found in [[the Nether]] in [[crimson forest]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Weeping vines are broken instantly using any tool. They have a 33% chance to drop a single weeping vine when broken, increased to 55% with [[Fortune]] I, 77% with Fortune II, and 100% with Fortune III. They always drop a single weeping vine when broken with [[shears]] or a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. Any segments left unsupported from above break with a 33% drop chance, regardless of tool used. Accordingly, weeping vines are best harvested from the bottom.

=== Natural generation ===
Weeping vines generate naturally inside crevices within the ceilings, or on [[huge crimson fungi]] in the [[crimson forest]] biome.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
A huge fungus grown by {{ctrl|using}} [[bone meal]] on a [[crimson fungus]] generates weeping vines growing on it.

Each random tick, weeping vines have a 10% chance of growing one block downward. At default random tick speed, each fungus grows approximately every {{convert|13653|ticks|minutes}}. Weeping vines stop growing once they reach the ground or when the block reaches an {{cd|age}} block state of 25, whichever is first.

[[Bone meal]] can be used to extend weeping vines and can be used anywhere in the chain to extend the whole chain. This can be useful for getting down from a high place in the nether. 

== Usage ==
Weeping vines can be placed on, and grow from, the bottom of a block. The top-most vine block always has a starting age value of 0, which increments every time the block grows. If the bottom-most vine block has an age below 25, it continues to grow provided that there is free space below the vine. When the vine does grow, a new vine block with an incremented age value is placed beneath it.

Weeping vines stop growing if [[shears]] are {{control|used}} on the tip.

=== Climbing ===
Weeping vines can be climbed by standing in them and holding the {{control|jump}} key. If there is a solid block behind the weeping vines, the {{control|walk forwards}} key can also be used.

=== Composting ===
Weeping vines can also be used on a [[composter]], with a 50% chance to raise the compost level by 1.
