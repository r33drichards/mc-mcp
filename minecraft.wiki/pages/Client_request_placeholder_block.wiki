The '''client_request_placeholder_block''' is an [[invisible block]] that is used as a placeholder while loading chunk data.

== Obtaining ==
This block cannot be obtained via {{cmd|give}} or {{cmd|setblock}}, and as such can only be obtained through inventory editors or [[add-on]]s.

== Usage ==
Though the block is visually transparent, it behaves as an [[opaque]] block, and thus allows for solid blocks connected to it to be seen through.

It cannot be selected; attempting to do so targets anything behind it. The block has no intended use for the player but is used as a placeholder block when loading chunks. The block also causes entities to become "frozen" when inside the block (unable to move whilst pausing animations).
