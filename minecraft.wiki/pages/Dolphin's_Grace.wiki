'''Dolphin's Grace''' is a [[status effect]] that increases an [[entity]]'s speed while they are in [[water]]. It is obtained by [[sprint-swimming]] while a [[dolphin]] is nearby.

== Effect ==
Dolphin's Grace causes the player to swim significantly faster and lose speed at a slower rate, but also makes changing directions slower. Dolphin's Grace on its own allows players to travel 9.8 m/s underwater without [[Depth Strider]], making it faster than a [[boat]]. Combining it with Depth Strider, players are able to travel at much higher speeds,<ref>{{bug|MC-129576||Dolphin's grace combined with depth strider makes you swim extremely fast}}</ref> adding 8.983 m/s per level. Potentially higher speeds are possible by adding [[soul soil]] underwater and using [[Soul Speed]]-enchanted boots, along with the [[Speed]] status effect.

Dolphin's Grace only affects horizontal movement speed. Vertical movement is not affected.<ref>{{bug|MC-130268||Dolphin's grace only affects horizontal swimming speed}}</ref>

This status effect is exclusive to {{JE}}. Although players {{in|bedrock}} are also able to experience a significant gain in speed if the same conditions as in ''Java Edition'' are met, it is not considered a status effect as no effect icon is shown.

[[Invisibility]] reduces the range dolphins give this effect based on the amount of armor the player is wearing.
