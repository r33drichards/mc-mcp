|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w22a|[[File:Tripwire (texture) JE1.png|32px]] The tripwire item uses this texture in inventories, when held in first or third person view or as a dropped item.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w23a|[[File:Tripwire (inventory) JE2.png|32px]] The main tripwire texture has changed to be translucent. However, as items did not support translucency at this time, all translucent pixels appear opaque. This may or may not have produced any actual visible change.}}
