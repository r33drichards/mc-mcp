A '''diamond axe''' is a variant of [[axe]] that is crafted from [[diamonds]]. It can be used to cut down trees faster, to [[Axe#Stripping and scraping|strip]] [[log]]s and [[scrape]] [[Copper#Blocks|copper-based blocks]], and as a melee weapon that disables [[shields]]. It is the second-highest [[tier]] of axe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack speed, and durability than an [[iron axe]]. It can be upgraded into a [[netherite axe]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

=== Trading ===

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
Diamond axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.{{note|Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.}}
<references group="note"/>

=== Stripping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a diamond axe on a [[log]], [[wood]] block, or [[block of bamboo]] turns it into a [[stripped log]], [[stripped wood]], or [[block of stripped bamboo]], respectively. This uses 1 point of the axe's durability.

=== Scraping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a diamond axe on a waxed or oxidized [[copper]] block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise removes a level of oxidization. This uses 1 point of durability.

=== Weapon ===
When used as a weapon, a diamond axe loses 2 durability points.

==== {{JE}} ====
Attacking a [[shield]] user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. [[Vindicator]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, or other [[mob]]s with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a [[sword]] of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]], resulting in lower <abbr title="Damage/Second">DPS</abbr>.

The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.</ref>

}}

A diamond axe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[diamond]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A diamond axe can receive the following enchantments:

=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a diamond axe can be upgraded to a [[netherite axe]], increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed and attack damage, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.
