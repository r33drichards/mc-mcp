{{spoiler warning}}
An '''Easter egg''' is an intentional-hidden message, inside joke, or feature in a work such as a computer program, web page, video game, television program, movie, book or any other form of media. ''[[Minecraft]]'' features several Easter eggs hidden in the game.

== Seasonal events ==
{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}
=== Halloween ===
{{Redirect|Halloween}}

On October 31, [[zombie]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s, [[drowned]], [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], [[parched]], [[zombified piglin]]s, and [[wither skeleton]]s have a 22.5% chance to wear [[carved pumpkin]]s and a 2.5% chance to wear [[jack o'lantern]]s on their heads. This feature was added in [[Java Edition 1.4.2]] for Halloween 2012 onwards, and to [[Legacy Console Edition]] sometime after.

The only [[splash]] text shown is "OOoooOOOoooo! Spooky!"

=== Christmas ===
{{main|Chest#Christmas chest|Java Edition mentioned features#Joke features}}

From December 24–26, [[chest]]s, large chests, trapped chests, copper chests, large copper chests, and minecarts with chest have their textures changed to Christmas chests that resemble wrapped Christmas presents. This was added in Java Edition 1.4.6 for Christmas 2012. A texture file called "skis.png" was also added in Java Edition 1.4.6 in the same folder as the Christmas chests, but it was added by [[Dinnerbone]] as a [[wikipedia:red herring|red herring]]. This was re-added for Christmas 2013,<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|283385906587652096|Enjoy your fancy gift-chests, minecrafters! They'll look great under a giant tree. (And those skis?

This also happened again in 2014 with a new splash reading, "Merry X-Mas!" and repeated in every Christmas since. The change doesn't apply to [[boats with chests]].<ref>{{bug|MC-249378}}</ref> You can also change your device's time manually to December 24--26 to get the Christmas Chests.

=== New year ===
The only splash that can be seen on January 1 is "Happy new year!".<gallery heights="80px">
File:Happy new year!.png|"Happy new year!" splash.

== Blocks & items ==
=== Thing banner pattern ===
A [[thing banner pattern]] can be crafted using an [[enchanted golden apple]] and [[paper]]. When put on a [[banner]], it displays Mojang Studios' old logo in whatever color [[dye]] was used. It is labeled "Thing" in the inventory. The Swedish word "mojäng" means gadget or thing.

=== Mobs on chiseled blocks ===
[[File:Mobs_with_there_corresponding_chiseled_block_version.png|thumb|300px|All mobs behind their corresponding block.]]

Many chiseled blocks have mobs or references to mobs on them. 

[[Chiseled sandstone]] has a [[creeper]] face.

[[Chiseled red sandstone]] shows a [[wither]].

[[Chiseled Nether bricks]] has a [[wither skeleton]] face.

[[Chiseled resin bricks]] has a [[creaking]] face.

[[Chiseled deepslate]] has a [[warden]] face.

[[Chiseled polished blackstone]] has a [[piglin]]'s snout.

[[Chiseled tuff]] has a wind-like pattern from the [[wind charge]] shot by a [[breeze]].

== Textures ==
Some textures have hidden things in space unused by the game. Some of these are accessible by unzipping [[client.jar]] found in the versions folder.

=== Armor stand ===
In the texture for the [[armor stand]], in an unused area in the bottom right, the name "Searge" can be seen in a black box. This is presumably put there as a signature by [[Searge]], the developer that implemented armor stands. In the bottom left, the name "Jappa" can be seen. This is likely another signature, this time from the texture artist, [[Jappa]], who was in charge of the Texture Update. Another name was by Chiwi, who updated the Smooth Stone base plate texture.

=== Capes ===
{{main|Cape}}
Some cape textures have a secret on the underside where it is not very visible.

File:CapeEE 15anni.png|The 15th Anniversary cape has the number 15 on its underside because it was released on [[15th Anniversary|Minecraft's 15th birthday]].
</gallery>

=== Clouds ===
The cloud texture has a [[creeper]] face in it, which can be occasionally visible in-game in the sky.

== Languages ==
{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}
There are five joke [[language]]s available at the language menu: Pirate Speak, LOLCAT, Shakespearean English, Anglish (puristic English), and ɥsᴉlƃuƎ (uʍoᗡ ǝpᴉsd∩) (upside-down English).

''Minecraft'' is also translated into tlhIngan Hol, the Klingon language from ''Star Trek''; Quenya, one of the Elvish languages from ''Lord of the Rings''; [https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban Lojban], a conlang created by the Logical Language Group; and [[wikipedia:Esperanto|Esperanto]], a conlang created by L.L. Zamenhof.

If a player types "'''excitedze'''" into the search bar in the [[recipe book]], their language is automatically switched to Pirate Speak. "ExcitedZe" is the username of [[Maria Lemón]], a former Mojang Studios staff member.<ref>{{tweet|DxnnySch|850390981719584768|@MiaLem_n Whats you Ingame-name?|April 7, 2017}}<br>{{tweet|MiaLem_n|850413607804391425|ExcitedZe|April 7, 2017}}<br>{{tweet|DxnnySch|850588593437515776|Thx ☺|April 7, 2017}}</ref>

== Names ==
=== Naming mobs ===
Several mobs can be renamed by using a [[name tag]] to create an effect. These names are all case sensitive.

==== Upside-down mobs ====
[[File:Upsidedownskele.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An example of 2 pigs and a creeper being named "Dinnerbone".]]Any mob (with the exception of the [[ender dragon]], [[squid]] and [[glow squid]]) named "[[Dinnerbone]]" or "[[Grumm]]" through [[name tag]]s, commands, or any other method, is rendered upside-down. The mob's behavior does not change.

This also applies to players, allowing Dinnerbone and Grumm's avatars to be rendered upside-down. This can be toggled using the "Cape" button from the "Skin Customization" menu.<ref>{{ytl|59sRgPP6POE|t=5m34s}}</ref> {{IN|Bedrock}}, if the player names themselves Dinnerbone or Grumm, they are rendered upside-down. This works only if the player did not sign into Xbox Live.{{Verify}}

==== Rainbow sheep ====
[[File:Jeb Sheep JE4 BE3.webp|thumb|upright=0.5|A sheep named "jeb_"]]
Naming a sheep "[[Jens Bergensten|jeb_]]" using a [[name tag]] or a renamed [[spawn egg]] causes it to continually cycle through all colors a sheep can be dyed. When sheared using shears, however, the sheep drops wool of the original color of the sheep rather than the color that currently appears on the sheep. If a sheep is named jeb_, and then sheared, the leftover wool on its skin continues to cycle through all the colors.

==== "Toast the Bunny" ====
[[File:Toast Rabbit JE2 BE2.png|thumb|upright=0.5|A rabbit named "Toast" {{until|First Drop 2026}}]]
[[File:Toast Rabbit JE3 BE3.png|thumb|upright=0.5|A rabbit named "Toast" {{upcoming|First Drop 2026}}]]
When Ryan Holtz was developing [[rabbit]]s, user xyzen420 asked him to make a skin that would look like his girlfriend's lost rabbit, Toast.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/27hjog/to_themogminer_my_bunny_is_missing_please_help_me/</ref> Now, naming a rabbit with a name tag or a rabbit spawn egg called "Toast" causes the rabbit's skin pattern to look like Toast as a memorial. This also works if the player attempts to name The Killer Bunny; although while the rabbit's appearance uses the Toast skin, it can still attack as it would without the given name. When the player is killed by the renamed Killer Bunny, the [[death message]] says "<playername> was slain by Toast". "Toast" is re-textured to have black spots on its fur.

==== "Johnny" ====
{{Main|Vindicator#"Johnny"}}
If a [[vindicator]] is named "Johnny" or has its <code>Johnny</code> tag set to <code>1b</code>, it attacks any nearby mobs except other [[illager]]s, [[agent]]s{{only|be|edu|short=1}}, and [[ghast]]s. It will also try to attack [[creaking]]s while also running away from them. This references the movie [[wikipedia:The Shining (film)|''The Shining'']].

=== Players ===
==== deadmau5's ears ====
[[File:deadmau5_blue.png|100px]] [[File:deadmau5_RED.png|100px]]

With the addition of [[cape]]s, Notch also added ears for [[deadmau5]]. The ears are additional geometry attached to the player's head, with the texture contained within deadmau5's skin file. deadmau5 cannot disable his ears; erasing the ear texture from the skin file would still render them with a solid black color. deadmau5's name tag is also programmed to render ten pixels higher to be above the ears. The ears are set to show up based on the username, rather than the UUID of the player, meaning that if deadmau5 were to change his name, he would not keep his ears.

== Splashes ==
=== Never displayed splash ===
Within the "texts" folder, there is a text file named <code>splashes.txt</code>. The text file contains all the [[splash]]es that appear on the title screen. One of them is "This message will never appear on the splash screen, isn't that weird?" If the text file is modified to only contain this string of text the game will crash. As its text implies, the splash is never displayed. However, in [[Legacy Console Edition]] it does display, but it has never been confirmed if it is a bug or an intentional feature.

=== Coronavirus ===
Special splashes were displayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They include "Wash your hands!" and "Support elderly relatives and friends!"

== Tributes to Technoblade ==
{{main|Technoblade}}
[[File:Technoblade On Launch Screen.png|thumb|left|The crown on the pig.]]
Following the announcement on June 30, 2022 that popular ''Minecraft'' [[YouTube]]r [[Technoblade]] passed away from stage 4 cancer, Mojang added his skin's crown to the pig on the ''Java Edition'' art in memory of him. A splash text "Technoblade never dies!" was also added in his honor in [[Java Edition 1.19.1|1.19.1]]. The launcher art was later changed to reflect [[The Wild Update]], removing the pig and the crown from the launcher.

A Technoblade pig also appears in {{AMCM}}. [[Movie:Henry|Henry]] asks “is he some kind of king?”, to which [[Movie:Steve|Steve]] responds “No, that’s a legend”.

== References to other franchises==
<!-- do not add a reference without a source from Mojang claiming the reference -->
'''''Portal'''''
* {{IN|BE}}, and in older versions of [[Java Edition]], the [[achievement]] for crafting a [[cake]] is called "The Lie", likely in reference to the phrase "The cake is a lie" from the video game ''[[wikipedia:Portal (video game)|Portal]]''.
* The April Fools snapshot [[24w14potato]] contains the splash "Oh hi! So, how are you holding up? BECAUSE I'M A POTATO!", a line said by GLaDOS in the video game ''[[wikipedia:Portal 2|Portal 2]]''.

'''''Half-Life'''''
* {{IN|BE}}, and in older versions of [[Java Edition]], the [[achievement]] for travelling a kilometre by [[minecart]] is called "On a Rail", likely in reference to the chapter of the same name in the video game ''[[wikipedia:Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''.

'''''Team Fortress 2'''''
* [[Java Edition Beta 1.4]], released for April Fools' Day 2011, introduced the [[Locked Chest]] which when opened displayed the name "Steve Co. Supply Crate", a reference to the Mann Co. Supply Crates found in the video game ''[[wikipedia:Team Fortress 2|Team Fortress 2]]''.
* The splash text "The creeper is a spy!" is a reference to the Spy class in Team Fortress 2, and the various voice lines that other characters say to alert others of his presence.

'''''Counter-Strike'''''
* Three of the paintings in the game are of stages in Counter-Strike 1.6, [[List of painting textures|de_aztec]] 1 & 2 and [[List of painting textures|Target successfully bombed]].<ref>{{tweet|MadeOfPolygons|1636487481322242049|@Zetterstrand the painting called "Target successfully bombed" Is taken in Counter-Strike 1.6.

'''''The Shining'''''
* If a [[vindicator]] is named "Johnny", it behaves like a [[zoglin]], attacking every mob except [[agent]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[illager]]s and themselves. It cycles between attacking [[creaking]]s and running away from them. This references the scene "Here's Johnny" from the movie ''{{w|The Shining}}''.<ref>{{mcnet|meet-vindicator|Meet the Vindicator|June 20, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>

'''''Star Fox'''''
* The [[achievement]] for using a [[trident]] enchanted with [[Riptide]] is called [[Achievements#Do a Barrel Roll.21|"Do a Barrel Roll!"]] in reference to the popular phrase said by Peppy Hare in [[wikipedia:Star Fox 64|''Star Fox 64'']] and [[wikipedia:Star Fox Zero|''Star Fox Zero'']], telling the player to execute an aerial maneuver called a barrel roll.

'''''2001: A Space Odyssey'''''
* Before [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], using {{cmd|help}} in a command block displays one of a few joke messages, one of which is "Oh my god, it's full of stats", a reference to a quote from the novel ''[[wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. In the [[Crash#Witty comments|witty comments]] of a crash report, there are two other quotes, "I'm sorry, Dave." and "Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that."

'''''Age of Empires'''''
* If an [[evoker]] sees a blue sheep, it turns the sheep into a red sheep while uttering "wololo". This is a reference to the Priest unit from the [[wikipedia:Age of Empires|''Age of Empires'']] real-time strategy game series, which would utter "wololo" while converting enemy units to their side, changing their color. The evoker specifically uses the sound sample from the 1997 title ''[[w:Age of Empires II|Age of Empires]]''.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|781679411200491520|I'm still in LA!

'''''Grim Fandango'''''
* The painting '[[List of painting textures|Mortal Coil]]' is partly a reference to the character Bruno Martinez from Grim Fandango.<ref>{{tweet|_MightyPotato|1636021966997164035|I wanted to get a print of the skeleton in the paper boat, or conch shell?

'''''{{va|Terraria}}'''''
* One of the games splash texts recommends the game [https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/khk56/while_trying_minecraft_18/ Terraria]. "Also try Terraria!"

'''''Project Zomboid'''''
* One of the games splash texts recommends the game [https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/ryejt6/project_zomboid_is_also_a_minecraft_splash_screen/ Project Zomboid]. "Also try Project Zomboid!"

'''''Pokémon'''''
* The translation key in {{el|be}} for invalid structures is {{cd|feature.missingno}}, likely a reference to the famous glitch [[w:Pokémon|Pokémon]] [[w:MissingNo.|MissingNo.]] in the [[w:Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow|first generation of ''Pokémon'' games]].
** The term "missingno" is also used in {{el|je}} internally for the resource locations of the [[missing texture]] and [[missing model]]. It was also [[missingno|previously used]] for [[splash]] texts when none could be loaded, as well as items with invalid entries in CanDestroy/CanPlaceOn NBT tags.

'''''Quake'''''
* The "[[Quake Pro]]" FOV option is likely a reference to the Quake series of first-person shooter games, specifically the fact that pro players often use an extremely high FOV to see as much around them as possible.

'''''Doctor Who'''''
* The name of the Regeneration effect when the LOLCAT: Kingdom of Cats language option is selected is "Time Lordz Buffeh", a likely reference to the television series ''Doctor Who'', particularly the fact that the race of Time Lords can regenerate into a new body.
'''''World Of Goo'''''
* One of the games splash texts recommends the game [[w:World_of_Goo|World of Goo]]. "Also try World Of Goo!"

== Other ==
=== ''Minceraft'' ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}{{main|Main menu#Minceraft}}

There is a 0.01% chance for the title screen to display "Minceraft" instead of "Minecraft". The beginning of crash logs can have the phrase "You should try our sister game, Minceraft!"

<gallery heights="80px">
File:Minceraft Crash.png|Minceraft in the crash logs.
File:MainMenu Minceraft.png|Minceraft in-game.
</gallery>

=== "Someone is closing me!" ===
{{main|Crash}}
[[File:Someone Closed Me.png|thumb|The "Someone is closing me!" Easter Egg.]]

After a crash, the second-to-last line of text on the game output launcher tab says "Someone is closing me!"

=== Enchanting symbols ===
[[File:Standard Galactic Alphabet.png]]

The enchanting symbols shown on the enchantment selection contain random words using the standard galactic alphabet from ''{{w|Commander Keen}}'' games, but the words in enchanting tables are randomized and do not correlate with any enchantments. This language shows up in [[10 Years of Minecraft]], as a puzzle.

=== Sounds ===
==== Cave sound 14 ====
[[File:Sound14 spectrogram.png|thumb|right|The creeper face in the ambient sound 14 spectrogram]]

When [[Ambience|ambient sound]] 14 is put into a spectrogram, a creeper face can be seen. Samuel Åberg said that he made this sound with a spectrogram program.<ref>{{ytl|4XmJPb4Qt5Y|HOW MINECRAFT SOUNDS ARE MADE|Minecraft|Aug 3, 2024|t=6m37s}}</ref>

====== Cave sound 21 ======
[[File:Cave 21 morse code.png|thumb|"BEHIND" being spelt in Morse code in the ambient sound 21 spectrogram]]
If ambient sound 21 is listened to closely or put in a spectrogram, it spells out Morse code: "'''-... . .... .. -. -.." ,''' which translates to "behind". When Samuel Åberg was asked about this, he responded with "''Creepy 👀''".<ref>[https://x.com/slamp0000/status/1896163988603597267]</ref>

==== Crimson forest ambience ====
Many of the sounds were created using balloons.<ref>https://youtu.be/BPJOs8nFMv0?t=44s</ref>

==== Music Disc 11 ====
[[File:Disc 11 Spectrogram.png|250px|thumb|The static at the end of Disc 11 viewed in a [[w:Spectrogram|spectrogram]]. Steve's face can be seen here as well as the numbers 12418.]]
[[File:Disc 11 Spectrogram 12418.png|250px|thumb|The numbers 12418.]]
If the .ogg file for "11" is turned into a {{w|spectrogram}} in an audio editor, the static at the end displays an image of [[Steve]]'s face and the numbers 12418. The numbers are a visual signature, where "C" is hexadecimal for "12", and combined with "418" creates "[[Daniel Rosenfeld|C418]]".

=== The killer bunny ===
The [[killer bunny]] is a variant of the rabbit that is hostile to all players. This is a reference to the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog from ''[[wikipedia:Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. It can be spawned only by using commands, and only {{in|java}}.

=== Crash screens ===
{{main|Crash#Witty comments}}
When the game runs into a fatal error and crashes, the crash log includes a message such as "Who set us up the TNT?" or "Hi. I'm Minecraft, and I'm a crashaholic."

=== .minecraft ===
==== Debug profile results ====
Debug profile results (triggered via {{cmd|debug}}) contain witty comments at the top, much like with crash reports.

* I'd Rather Be Surfing
* Shiny numbers!
* Am I not running fast enough? :(
* I'm working as hard as I can!
* Will I ever be good enough for you? :(
* Speedy. Zoooooom!
* Hello world
* 40% better than a crash report.
* Now with extra numbers
* Now with less numbers
* Now with the same numbers
* You should add flames to things, it makes them go faster!
* Do you feel the need for... optimization?
* *cracks redstone whip*
* Maybe if you treated it better then it'll have more motivation to work faster! Poor server.

=== Item models ===
{{more images|section=1|Renders of Steve and Alex wearing the spyglass and the lightning rod.}}
Several items when worn on the head (using {{cmd|item replace}}) have unique placements. The [[end rod]] and [[spyglass]] protrude from the head like a horn, the [[lightning rod]] sits at the side like a snorkel, [[fish]] look like an ear and mic piece, [[banners]] display similar to how [[Raid captain|raid captains]] wear them, [[fence gates]] are worn like glasses, [[bones]] are held in the mouth like a dog, [[leads]] go around the eye like a monocle, and [[feathers]] stick up at the back of the head.<gallery>

=== Command blocks ===
==== Searge ====
Running "[[Searge]]" as the command in the command block without a preceding "<code>/</code>" sets the previous output to "#itzlipofutzli". This Easter egg is case insensitive.

==== autoexec.bat ====
In the language files, the key for the command block’s “Always Active” feature is <code>advMode.mode.autoexec.bat</code>, a tribute to DOS-based operating systems that made use of the file "AUTOEXEC.BAT" to run commands upon startup of the system.

== Removed Easter eggs==
Several Easter eggs have been removed from ''Minecraft''.

=== Command blocks ===
Command blocks have various Easter eggs with messages being added to the previous output.

==== Searge says ====
If the command {{cmd|help}} is run via a [[command block]], it gave various messages prefixed with "Searge says: " as the previous output when activated. The following messages existed:
* "Yolo"
* "/achievement take achievement.understandCommands @p"
* "Ask for help on twitter"
* "/deop @p"
* "Scoreboard deleted, commands blocked"
* "Contact helpdesk for help"
* "/testfornoob @p"
* "/trigger warning"
* "Oh my god, it's full of stats"
* "/kill @p[name=!Searge]"
* "Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
* "Sorry, no help today".

This no longer works in 1.13 or above ({{bug|MC-124295}}); instead the {{cmd|help}} command now runs normally, but the previous output gives only the last line ("/xp -> experience") due to there being space for just one line.

=== ''Java Edition'' launcher ===
[[File:Easter Egg Launcher.png|thumb|right|Some launcher Easter eggs. The shrugging emoticon has been clicked, causing it to turn white. A witch has also appeared after the player hovered over the play button.]]

Before the release of the ''Java Edition'' launcher version [[Launcher 2.1.497x|2.1.497x]], the launcher contained multiple Easter eggs. If the player hovered their cursor over the "Play" button for a few seconds, a random mob would appear in the bottom right corner of the launcher. In the top left corner of the launcher, the player could see a translucent creeper face. There was about a {{frac|1|11}} chance of the creeper face being replaced with a shrugging emoticon, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. When the player clicked on either of these, they turned solid white. Clicking them again would return them to their translucent state. In addition, if the player pressed <code>ctrl+b</code>, the [[experience orb]] pickup sound plays. These no longer work since the launcher has since been updated.

In the old [[Legacy Console Edition]] TU12-TU13 Tutorial World, on the top floor of the sandstone pyramid, there are four blocks of gold on top of a block of obsidian. This is the "Tower of Pimps". It was created by [[wikipedia:Gavin Free|Gavin Free]] of [[wikipedia:Achievement Hunter|Achievement Hunter]] in their video "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tihfx6DunZs&feature=youtu.be&t=3m20s Let's Play Minecraft Part 2 - On a Rail!]" and has become a symbol of the group's ''Let's Play Minecraft'' series, mainly as a trophy of their competitions in their Achievement City world within ''Xbox 360 Edition'' and ''Java Edition''.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsKDtf72u-0</ref>

==== Stampylonghead reference ====
In the Legacy Console Edition TU19/CU7/1.12 Tutorial World, there was an island in the northeast side of the world and it had a remake of several buildings from Minecraft [[YouTube]]r [[Stampylonghead]], including his house along with his boat, the S.S. Stumpy.<ref>''not'' the S.S. Stampy, see: {{ytl|2w4zzVPJ4WU|t=13m48s}}</ref>

Additionally, the boat was seen in the trailer for [[Legacy Console Edition]] TU19/CU7.<ref>{{ytl|eJj3zgI4v9A|t=1m15s}}</ref>

A world based on the map, containing all of his creations, would later be released by [[4J Studios]] on the [[Marketplace|Minecraft Marketplace]] in 2024 as "Stampy's Lovely World".<ref>[https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/4j-studios/stampy%E2%80%99s-lovely-world/2cac624e-2f90-4b3c-aa62-6dd0493ad20e]</ref>

=== 1K IN 24h ===
{{main|Java Edition Alpha v1.0.13_01}}
[[File:Alpha 1.0.13 01 1K IN 24h.png|thumb|1K IN 24h logo.]]
In July 29, 2010, after ''[[Minecraft]]'' got over 1000 sales in 24 hours, [[Notch]] decided to celebrate by reuploading [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.13_01|Alpha v1.0.13_01]] with the ''Minecraft'' logo being replaced by "1K IN 24h".

It was since been removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.14|Alpha v1.0.14]] by reverting it to the previous version.

=== Notch's birthday ===
[[File:1JuneNotch.png|thumb|Notch's birthday splash text in early alpha.]]
[[File:notch b-day.png|thumb|Notch's birthday splash text in 1.7.9.]]
On June 1, Notch's birthday, the only splash displayed is "Happy Birthday, Notch!" 

This splash was removed in [[Java Edition 1.8.5]], since Notch no longer works for Mojang.

==== Notch's death ====
When [[Notch]] died in-game, he dropped an additional [[apple]] along with his inventory. At a certain time in-game, these were unobtainable.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/s2oqp/i_am_erik_broes_aka_grum_developer_of_minecraft/c4aoo35</ref> This no longer occurs.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgYFN1FRKYg&t=2173</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgYFN1FRKYg&t=2289</ref>

=== "Super Secret" settings ===
In snapshot [[13w36a]] for [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], Dinnerbone added a ''Super Secret Settings'' button, which could be viewed in the options screen. Clicking it would blare a random game sound with a lower pitch and change the [[shader]] of the screen. These effects would not necessarily work on computers without a graphics card that supported OpenGL 2.1. This was removed in snapshot [[15w31a]] for 1.9.

=== missingno splash ===
In older versions, if one were to delete the file splashes.txt without also deleting the META-INF folder, the splash text on the title screen would appear as "missingno". This is a reference to the infamous glitch Pokémon {{w|MissingNo.}} found in the first generation of ''Pokémon'' games. This was later changed to a {{w|zero-width no-break space}}, which was originally displayed in ''Minecraft''{{'}}s Unicode font as a box with the letters "ZWNBSP" within it.

The splash was added in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.12]] and it's the only vanilla version with this splash by default since all splashes were temporarily removed.

In [[Java Edition 1.14.2 Pre-Release 2|1.14.2-pre2]] and for the occasion of the 10 years of ''Minecraft''{{'}}s release on May 17, 2019, the [[cake]] had a big "10" placed like candles, and the only [[splash text]] that appeared was "Turning 10 years old!"<ref>https://resources.download.minecraft.net/8b/8b4ff4e0937149a16bc246116bb92d1f3c638e73</ref> This was reverted to the way they were before on May 20, 2019, and is unable to be seen again in-game even when going back to 1.14.2-pre2 and changing the time of the device to May 17-20 of 2019.

=== Guardian ===
Before the [[Texture Update]], in the [[guardian]] and [[elder guardian]] textures, there was an unused area saying "jeb".

=== Zombie pigman ===
Before the Texture Update, in an unused area for the [[zombie pigman]] texture, the words "THX XAPHOBIA" could be seen. This was written by [[Notch]] to give credit and thanks to the original creator of the texture, XaPhobia.<ref>{{tweet|notch|28832121068|@Micleee thank you!|October 26, 2010}}<br />{{tweet|Kiina_RS|1693649559983980858|i happened to read the mc wiki and ended up on capes page. and poor micleee.his cape got removed according to wiki when other users asked Notch for personal capes.since then there has been 8 more personal capes. and 6 unique capes that more than 1 person has.micleee lost theirs:(|August 21, 2023}}</ref><ref>http://pokeaddicted.deviantart.com/art/Zombie-Pigmen-183701798</ref>
