'''Chorus plants''' are [[block]]s that [[Structure|naturally generate]] on the [[Terrain features#Outer island|outer island]]s of [[the End]]. They drop [[chorus fruit]] when broken. They can also be grown using [[chorus flower]]s.

== Obtaining ==
The item form cannot be obtained in [[Survival]] mode, even with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment; however, it is available in the [[Creative inventory]].

=== Breaking ===
Chorus plants can be [[Breaking|broken]] using any [[tool]], but an axe is the quickest. Breaking one block of a [[chorus tree]] generally causes all chorus plants and flowers above to break due to lack of support. Upon breaking, a chorus plant [[drops]] 0–1 [[chorus fruit]]. This is not affected by [[Fortune]].<ref>{{bug|MC-198924||Chorus Fruit doesn't have a higher chance with Fortune|Invalid}}</ref>

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Chorus Plant|Axe|drop=0|sword=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Chorus plants make up most of the [[chorus tree]]s that are naturally generated on the [[Terrain features#Outer island|outer island]]s of [[the End]]. Chorus trees are typically 10–15 blocks in height, although a single plant can reach up to 22 blocks.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
Chorus plants are generated as [[chorus flower]]s grow.

== Usage ==
Chorus plants can be broken to obtain [[chorus fruit]].

=== Support ===
Chorus plant blocks break automatically (with a 50% chance of dropping fruit), if the six surrounding blocks are not valid:

* a chorus plant with at least one other chorus plant horizontally adjacent breaks unless at least one of the vertically adjacent blocks is air
* a chorus plant breaks unless the block below is chorus plant or [[End stone]] or any horizontally adjacent block is a chorus plant above chorus plant or End stone

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Using [[commands]], it is possible to make chorus trees grow to heights not normally possible. This works because commands can reset the time value of chorus flowers, allowing them to grow indefinitely.
* Because breaking one part of the plant breaks all parts above it, cutting a large plant can cause a brief performance drop.
* The chorus plant is named due to the sound it makes when it grows.<ref>{{ytl|v3TXUTLClb0|Ask Mojang Midsummer Special with Jeb|Minecraft|June 18, 2020}}</ref>
