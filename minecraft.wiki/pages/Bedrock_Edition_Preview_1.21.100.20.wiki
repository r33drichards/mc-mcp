'''Beta 1.21.100.20''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.100.20''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the first beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.100]], released on June 10, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/37264366737421-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-100-20|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.100.20|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=June 10, 2025}}</ref> which fixes bugs and makes some small changes to improve [[parity]] with {{JE}}.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Accessibility]]'''
*Added screen narrator enumeration to UI buttons when adding a new server.

== Changes ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[World spawn]]'''
*The world spawn can now be set in the [[End]] using {{cmd|spawnpoint}}.

'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
*{{cmd|locate biome}} command now requires that the biome's namespace is specified (ex: {{cd|minecraft:plains}} instead of just {{cd|plains}}). Auto-complete suggestions for this command will now include namespaces.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Animal]]s'''
*The ambient sound interval for all animals has been adjusted to 6 seconds, matching {{JE}}.

'''[[Ghast]]s'''
*The ambient sound interval for all ghasts has been adjusted to 4 seconds, matching {{JE}}.

'''[[Snowball]]s, [[Ender Pearl]]s, [[Ender Eye]]s, [[Experience Bottle]]s, [[Splash Potion]]s, [[Lingering Potion]]s, and [[Ice Bomb]]s'''
* Their sprites, when rendered in the world, now have the correct scaling and positional offset.
* They now match {{JE}}, and also match better with their collider.

=== General ===
{{Missing information|section|The which marketplace-related menus were changed.}}
'''[[UI]]'''
*"Owned" or "Download" is now displayed on items the player owns outside of the "My Library" page.
*The Marketplace Pass chevron will now show on items that the user owns while on normal Marketplace pages. Not on the inventory. Owned/Download text moved to the right.
*Updated Marketplace Pass chevron to show on items in the inventory.
*Moved the "Owned"/"Download" text to the right side.

'''[[Settings#Audio|Audio Settings]] Screen'''
*The audio default volumes have been updated.
*Audio settings have been updated with a brand-new look and improved navigation:
**Each setting now includes a helpful description, making it easier to understand what it does.
**Improved interaction with sliders that are now smoother and more responsive than before.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Tree]]s'''
*Trees now generate more sparsely in [[grove]]s.
*Trees now generate more frequently in [[snowy plains]].

'''[[Frozen Ocean]]'''
*Its surface is no longer entirely covered by ice, and now features patches of open water.
*Icebergs in frozen ocean biomes now generate with a shape and frequency that more closely matches {{JE}}.

'''[[Deep Frozen Ocean]]'''
*Its surface is no longer covered by ice and now consists entirely of open water.

'''[[Old Growth Spruce Taiga]] and [[Old Growth Pine Taiga]]'''
*Increased the size of the [[podzol]] patches generated beneath mega pines and mega [[spruce]]s.
**This change affects both world generation and trees grown by players.

'''[[Mushroom]]s'''
*Mushrooms now properly generate under trees in [[swamp]]s and other biomes where they naturally generate.

'''[[Seagrass]]'''
*Seagrass no longer pokes through [[ice]] when it generates in shallow [[water]] in biomes that have ice on the water's surface.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Add-On]]s and Script Engine'''
*Custom biome names are no longer implied by their filenames. Biome names are explicitly specified via the {{cd|identifier}} property under the {{cd|description}} sub-object of their JSON definition.
*Biome identifiers must now be namespaced (ex: {{cd|minecraft:plains}}). Client biomes with a format version lower than 1.21.90 will have their identifier automatically prefixed {{cd|minecraft:}} when loaded if no namespace is already specified.
*Updated biome documentation to match updated biome JSON formatting and requirements.

'''[[API]]'''
*The {{cd|message}} parameter of the {{cd|setText}} method on {{cd|BlockSignComponent}} no longer accepts a {{cd|RawText}} as an option. This option was redundant as it is covered by the existing {{cd|RawMessage}} option. This affects the {{cd|setText}} method in all versions.
*Updated many error strings to use consistent punctuation.
*The properties {{cd|minValue}} and {{cd|maxValue}} on the {{cd|ArgumentOutOfBoundsError}} class are now optional.
*Updated several APIs to throw {{cd|ArgumentOutOfBoundsError}} instead of {{cd|Error}} where appropriate. This affects the following APIs in all versions:
**{{cd|Entity.addEffect}} for when the {{cd|amplifier}} setting is out of bounds (0 - 255) or {{cd|duration}} setting is out of bounds (1 - 20000000).
**{{cd|Entity.applyImpulse}} for when the {{cd|vector}} parameter is out of bounds (-1000 - 1000 per axis).
**{{cd|ItemStack.setLore}} and {{cd|ContainerSlot.setLore}} for when the {{cd|loreList}} parameter is out of bounds (0 - 100 max lines, 0 - 1000 max length per line).
**{{cd|ItemStack.setAmount}} and {{cd|ContainerSlot.setAmount}} for when the {{cd|amount}} parameter is out of bounds (0 - 255).
*Some existing errors that throw {{cd|ArgumentOutOfBoundsError}} have been updated to use a standardized error message. This affects the following APIs in all versions:
**{{cd|ScreenDisplay.setTitle}} for when the {{cd|fadeInDuration}}, {{cd|stayDuration}} or {{cd|fadeOutDuration}} settings are out of bounds (min value of 0).
**{{cd|StructureManager.placeStructure}} for when the {{cd|integrity}} setting is out of bounds (0 - 1).
**{{cd|PlayerAimAssist.setAimAssistSettings}} for when the {{cd|viewAngle}} setting is out of bounds (10 - 90) or {{cd|distance}} setting is out of bounds (1 - 16).
**{{cd|ItemStack.setNameTag}} and {{cd|ContainerSlot.setNameTag}} for when the {{cd|nameTag}} parameter length is out of bounds (0 - 255).
*Some existing errors that throw {{cd|InvalidArgumentError}} have been updated to use a standardized error message.
**{{cd|CustomSpawnRulesRegistry.registerObstructionCallback}} for when the {{cd|predicate}} parameter is empty or a duplicate.
*Released {{cd|DyeableItemComponent}} to {{cd|stable}}.

'''Block Components'''
*Modified {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component.
**Field {{cd|uv_lock}} no longer requires "Upcoming Creator Features" experiment to work, Json {{cd|format_version}} still needs to be >= {{cd|1.19.80}}.

'''Components'''
*Content warnings will log missing entity references in {{cd|Spawn Rule}} JSON.
*Content warnings will log missing references in {{cd|Client Biome}} JSON.
*The {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_axis_aligned}} component has been renamed to {{cd|minecraft:rotation_axis_aligned}}.

'''Entity Components'''
*Made the schema for the {{cd|minecraft:tick_world}} entity component stricter so that the parsing now refuses out of range values for {{cd|radius}} and {{cd|distance_to_players}}.

'''Graphical'''
*Changed cloud quality to player visible option and not a dev only option.

'''[[Jigsaw]]'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:blockstate_match}} and {{cd|minecraft:random_blockstate_match}} rules to jigsaw processors.
*Added heightmap projection type {{cd|none}} and made it the default setting, which instead of performing heightmap calculations uses the starting placement position.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", "Experimental Creator Camera", and "Custom Biomes" [[experimental]] toggles.

=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
*Added class {{cd|InvalidItemStackError}} to {{cd|beta}}.

'''[[Commands]]'''
*Added the {{cd|fov_set}} keyword to the {{cmd|camera}} command for changing the camera's field of view. Enabled with the Experimental Creator Camera toggle.

'''Scripting'''
*Added support for text to speech for tooltips at Server-UI forms.

'''UI'''
*Added support for navigation using keyboard and gamepad for tooltips at settings. Also, to be showed always inside the visible area. Mobile resolutions were having issues with this.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerHotbarSelectedSlotChangeAfterEvent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerHotbarSelectedSlotChangeAfterEventSignal}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerInventoryItemChangeAfterEvent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerInventoryItemChangeAfterEventSignal}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved interface {{cd|HotbarEventOptions}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved interface {{cd|InventoryItemEventOptions}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved enum {{cd|PlayerInventoryType}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Class {{cd|HotbarEventOptions}}.
**Field {{cd|allowedSlots}} added bound validation, numbers inside the array must be between 0 and 8.
*Class {{cd|InventoryItemEventOptions}}.
**Field {{cd|allowedSlots}} added bound validation, numbers inside the array must be positive.
*{{cd|ItemInventoryComponent}}
**Bundle UI now renders non-contiguous items added to the container with this API correctly.

'''[[Experiment]]al'''
*{{cmd|locate structure}} command (and similar structure-searching gameplay elements) will now quickly return no result if experimental Custom Biomes have replaced all of the biomes where that structure could appear.

'''Jigsaw'''
*{{cd|max_distance_from_center}} now parses horizontal and vertical values separately in an object while supporting horizontal only with parsing as a constant, the vertical value is now optional and defaults to having no limit.

'''World generation'''
*Mixing Terrain matching and Rigid Structures will no longer sink rigid structure 1 block.
*Chunks will no longer infinitely load when multiple structures are used within a structure set.
*Can now use {{cd|minecraft:empty_pool_element}} jigsaw template pools to represent empty elements.
