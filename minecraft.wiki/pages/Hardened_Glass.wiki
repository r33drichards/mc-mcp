'''Hardened glass''' is a type of [[glass]] that has been [[Chemistry Update|chemically]] strengthened. Like normal glass, it is available in clear and [[Hardened Stained Glass|colored variants]], although the latter can only be obtained by dyeing regular [[stained glass]] beforehand.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Unlike normal glass, hardened glass drops as an [[item]] to be picked up again when broken with any tool or by hand. It also takes significantly longer to break.

== Usage ==
Most blocks that require placement on a [[solid block]] can be placed on hardened glass. [[Torch]]es and [[redstone torch]]es, which can be placed on top of the hardened glass blocks, attaching to their sides is also proven possible.

Hardened glass blocks adjacent to other hardened glass blocks are invisible when viewed through the glass, but not when viewed through normal [[glass]].

The hardened glass also has much higher [[hardness]] than normal [[glass]].
