== Synopsis ==

[[Opal]] has almost done it all—fighting monsters, protecting people from [[pillagers]], and even defeating the legendary [[Ender Dragon]]! But that’s all in the past. Now, Opal has hung up her adventuring hat and is living the life of a happy creafter{{sic}}, far more likely to build you a [[bed]] than fight a [[Wither]]. In fact, Opal has decided that her time is best spent building her Dream Manor outside the very village that displays the [[Ender Dragon Skull]] she brought back from [[the End]]!

Meanwhile, Opal’s sister, [[Lisa]], is only at the beginning of her journey. She’s ready to be a hero. Just ask her. Or don’t. She’ll tell you anyway. She knows every single story ever told about her sibling, and probably a few other heroes as well. She admires Opal immensely, always has. But now it’s her turn to have an adventure.

And that adventure might be bigger than she could ever have imagined. One day, a traveling adventure named [[Braun]] arrives in town, claiming to know how to defeat a [[Warden]]—a fearsome [[mob]] that not even Opal has bested. Lisa jumps at the chance to join Braun on his epic quest, and Opal reluctantly agrees to accompany the duo—only to protect her sister, of course. But along the way, Opal might just rediscover her love of adventure, and realize that it’s even more fun when someone else is there to share in the story...<ref name=MCJourney/>
