'''Village & Pillage: A Wanderous Journey''' is an animated short made to promote the [[Village & Pillage]] update, telling the story of a wandering trader trying to sell products.

== Summary ==
A [[wandering trader]] is restocking the contents of a [[trader llama]]'s [[chest]] in a [[Old Growth Pine Taiga|old growth pine taiga]], pulling out a [[bucket of pufferfish]] and [[nautilus shell]]. They cross through the forest before eventually seeing someone across from a [[river]]. The trader pulls out many items with the hopes of selling to them, only for it to just be two [[foxes]] stacked on top of each other. Next they approach a [[pillager outpost]], the [[pillagers]] intimidate and immediately attack them. Now situated at a [[campfire]], the trader sits down depressed and desperate while their llama eats a [[sweet berry]] off the bush and immediately spits it out.

Moving on to a [[snowy plains]], the trader llama hums, creating a loud echo. Moving on to a [[desert]], they stand stoically as the sun sets. Moving on to an [[eroded badlands]] biome, the wandering trader hums, creating a loud echo. There is simply nobody around to trade with, it seems, leaving the trader very saddened and hurt. Approaching a waterfall, the trader llama walks over to the edge, and sees something. It goes back and pushes their owner to see what they saw; to their relief, a [[village]].
