''China Edition'''s variants have most of the same parity issues and differences between editions as their non-China equivalents. ''China Edition'' has 800 million registered accounts as of April 2025.<ref>{{cite|url=https://mc.163.com/m/news/media/20250407/29178_1225446.html|title=<span lang{{=}}"zh-Hans">给你整个世界！2025开发者大会精彩回顾！</span>|date=2025-04-07}}</ref>

== Variants ==
''China Edition'' includes multiple different variants of ''Minecraft''. The '''Mobile Edition'''{{efn|{{w|Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese}}: <span lang{{=}}"zh-Hans">手游版</span>; {{w|Pinyin}}: ''shǒu yóu bǎn''.}} is available as a variant of {{BE}}, and the '''Desktop Edition'''{{efn|{{w|Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese}}: <span lang{{=}}"zh-Hans">端游版</span>; {{tooltip|lit.|literal}} "Client Game Edition"; {{w|Pinyin}}: ''duān yóu bǎn''.}} has both {{BE}} and {{JE}} variants.

[[File:Mccn-mobile-login.jpg|thumb|Startup GUI.]]
[[File:Mccn-mobile-launcher-screenshot.jpg|thumb|Home page GUI.]]
[[File:Mccn-mobile-player-skin-screenshot.png|thumb|right|Profile GUI.]]
It offers a launcher to enter the game, which hides the main menu of the vanilla game and directly opens the world. In addition to launching the game, the Mobile Edition also features functions such as group social, community forum, homeland, and resource center.

The launcher has a built-in browser to display announcements and news webpages of ''China Edition'', some of which detect the environment to make the content visible only in-game. The launcher also has a network environment detection feature similar to vanilla {{BE}}, which prevents players from logging in when using Network Agent at OS level.

=== Development cycle ===

Since the release of China Edition, the mobile game version has undergone 5 major updates per year, usually in January, April, June (or July), September, and November. The Bedrock Edition version is usually updated to the next stable version with significant changes, with an average annual update of the main version number and the secondary version number. During September and November, there are two main updates: anniversary celebration and gratitude season. In April, there is a fixed secondary update without a specific theme, and a weekly hotfix. The main update requires downloading a new version launcher. The release time of the Android official server is may be earlier than the Android channel server and iOS/iPadOS/macOS platforms on the same day. The update is usually on the first or fourth Friday of the month. Within 2 weeks prior to the update, the Android official server invites players to download the development version of the mobile game to test the stability of the new version. The development version of the mobile game can play multiplayer games with players who are also using the development version, but can use the new version of the game content, features, and components in advance, and can receive trial rewards within the game.

Clearing the cache on the main interface removes all accumulated hotfix resource packages and cache files. After restarting, it automatically updates to the latest version.

''China Edition'' versions are identified in this format:<code>X.Y.Z:ABCDEF</code>. 

*X is the main version number, which increases by 1 only when there is a major update to the mobile game launcher.

*Y is the minor version number, which increases by 1 for each major update and returns to zero after the major version number is updated.

*Z is the minor version number, which is displayed as a hotfixed resource version on the game side, and returns to zero after the minor version number is updated. The minor version number for the development version of the mobile game is fixed at 100.

*ABCDEF is the development ordinal number, and the larger the number, the newer the version. The iOS/iPadOS/macOS platform is usually equal to or 1-2 different from the Android platform. The development version uses this value to refer to the relationship between the relative game side.

==== Multiplayer ====

;Online games
Online games are public, {{BE}} [[server]]<nowiki/>s approved by Netease. Game content is provided and maintained by the server developer. Relevant resource packs are automatically downloaded when entering the server for the first time.

Online games include survival, mini-games, themed RPGs, etc. Online Games servers allow for microtransactions; select products must be purchased with the premium currency "diamonds" for real currency.

;Local multiplayer
In the "Local Multiplayer" section of the online lobby, players can join multiplayer rooms created by others, or host their own using their own local world. The player can also set a local singleplayer world to automatically launch to the online lobby whenever the player joins. Hosts automatically gain [[operator]] status upon starting a room. Cross-platform play with ''China Edition'' PC players can be enabled or disabled. LAN multiplayer can also be enabled or disabled.

"Local Multiplayer" supports [[Resource pack|resource packs]] downloaded from the in-game Resource Center. Upon joining a multiplayer room, the resource packs used in the room's world automatically downloads for the player. 

Every online room has a unique 6 digit identification code. Players may join specific rooms by searching the corresponding code. The room host may set a room password. Players in a room can generate a QR code that can be scanned using the launcher "Scan" function. Upon a successful scan, the player automatically joins the corresponding multiplayer room. Players may advertise their multiplayer room on the World Chat. Players may also send link invitations to in-game friends, or to in-game group chats. To assist players in locating rooms of a particular genre, hosts may also advertise their room by labeling the room with two "room themes" of eight: Survival, Creative, Adventure, Simulation, Action, Architecture, PvP, and Leisure. Hosts may also advertise their rooms with a "room slogan." There are 15 preset slogans; custom slogans are available only to ''Minecraft China Edition'' Club Members.

"Local Multiplayer" rooms usually accommodate a minimum of 2 players, and a maximum of 10 players. ''Minecraft China Edition'' Club Members can host rooms of up to 30 players, depending on the player's membership level. The room host can set an arbitrary room player limit. If the number of players exceeds the limit, others cannot enter. Similar to {{BE}}, the host may set player access (Invited players/Friends/Public) and default player permissions (Visitor/Member/Operator/Custom).

Players can report "Local Multiplayer" rooms for violations in-game, or directly in the online lobby of the launcher.
[[File:Mccn-multiplayer world icon.png|thumb|upright|Multiplayer icon]]

;Team Lobby
The entrance to the team lobby is located on the launcher homepage, next to the player nickname. In the team lobby, players can create or join a team. Unlike a room, a team has a separate launcher chat room, and the room owner can change the online gameplay or local online map of the current team. Players can join other players' teams by searching for their names.

The room owner can set a team slogan, which is displayed on the team page. There are 10 preset slogans in total.

;Multiplayer Games

==== Currency ====
The resource center utilizes a two-tier currency system using "emeralds" and "diamonds" (not to be confused with their in-game equivalents). Both currencies use their [[Programmer Art]] textures.

{{ItemSprite|emerald-pre-texture-update}} '''Emeralds''' are a free currency that can be obtained through methods such as daily logins, monthly gifts, finishing tasks, and occasionally from the mailbox.

{{ItemSprite|diamond-pre-texture-update}} '''Diamonds''' are a premium currency that is purchased directly with {{wikipedia|renminbi}} (CN¥), and persists even after the end of the month. 1 diamond is equivalent to 1 {{wikipedia|fen (currency)|fen}}, or 0.01 CN¥. Diamonds can occasionally be obtained in events. Bounded Diamonds are a variant of the Diamond currency that cannot be purchased directly with real money. Bounded Diamonds are rewarded for purchases of standard Diamonds, and occasionally can be obtained in events.

==== Level System ====
[[File:Mccn-levelsystem.png|right|thumb|Level System diagram.]]
Every ''China Edition'' player is ranked using "Levels" from 1-50 based on their playtime, as well as the amount of '''Diamonds''' purchased. A player's level is displayed on their Personal Homepage, in various comment areas, etc. A lower "Level" applies a time limit on how often a player can comment, or post on their Personal Homepage; this limit is reduced up to 1 second as the player's level increases. Players of Oak Rank (level 1-5) are unable to comment or post on their Personal Homepage.

The level icons (ordered low to high) are: {{BlockSprite|Oak Planks}} Oak, {{BlockSprite|Acacia Planks}} Acacia, {{BlockSprite|Sand}} Sand, {{BlockSprite|Cobblestone}} Cobblestone, {{BlockSprite|Block of Iron}} Iron, {{BlockSprite|Block of Emerald}} Emerald, {{BlockSprite|Gold Block top}} Gold, {{BlockSprite|Diamond Block top}} Diamond, {{BlockSprite|Purpur Block}} Purpur, and {{BlockSprite|Bedrock}} Bedrock, each representing 5 consecutive levels.

=== Java Classic Edition ===
{{Distinguish|Java Edition Classic}}

==== Game content ====
[[File:Mccn-launcher-screenshot.png|thumb|Home page GUI in Java Classic Edition.]]
The "Start Game" in the bottom left corner of the launcher is the starting point for the game. Players can play various games based on Java and Bedrock versions in the Windows version. The Java version used in the Chinese version has a small amount of text that is slightly different from Standardization of Translations. The content of the base bedrock version is basically the same as that of the mobile game, and it can be used for interactive gaming.

The "Start Game" section prioritizes displaying players' recent games, and new game content can also be searched and downloaded by category. The launcher skips the main menu and directly enter the game.

===== Single player game =====
The single player game section allows players to manage all local game saves across versions. By selecting save, players can view detailed information including version, game duration, installed components, and more. Single player game saves can be exported, and when creating a world, saves can be imported and a world with the same version can be created. When starting the Java version save, multiple components developed by NetEase are forced to be built-in. At the same time, you can choose to open the "Command Suspension Window" built-in component. After opening, a button is displayed in the upper left corner of the game, and you can use commonly used commands with just one click.

Players can choose the following game versions when creating a world:

*''Java Edition'': [[Java Edition 1.7.10 | 1.7.10]], [[Java Edition 1.11.2 | 1.11.2]], [[Java Edition 1.12.2 | 1.12.2]], [[Java Edition 1.16.4 | 1.16.4]], [[Java Edition 1.18.1 | 1.18.1]], [[Java Edition 1.20.1 | 1.20.1]], [[Java Edition 1.20.6 | 1.20.6]] , [[Java Edition 1.21|1.21]], (with Forge as the built-in module loader).

*''Bedrock Edition'': original version of Bedrock version synchronized with mobile games, based on [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.0]] "ray tracing version".

''Java Edition'' has a built-in module loader "Forge". After an update, some uncommon Java Edition versions were removed from the world creation page. This change does not affect existing saves. In the launcher, the names of [[Java Edition 1.15.2]] and above omit the minor version number, such as [[Java Edition  1.16.4|1.16.4]] will be displayed as 1.16.

*Versions removed from the create world page include: [[Java Edition  1.8|1.8]], [[Java Edition  1.8.8|1.8.8]], [[Java Edition  1.9.4|1.9.4]], [[Java Edition  1.10.2|1.10.2]], [[Java Edition  1.13.2|1.13.2]], [[Java Edition  1.14.3|1.14.3]], [[Java Edition  1.15.2|1.15.2]].

Single player game saves can be uploaded to the cloud for cross device gaming, and players have 5 save slots and 1GB of storage space; Members have an additional 2 archive slots and 2GB of storage space. The archive slots of members are locked after the membership expires and cannot be uploaded or downloaded.

===== Multiplayer games =====
; Network Game

Online games are officially certified Java customized servers in the Chinese version of games, with Apollo as the core. The server host is located in NetEase's data center. The game content is provided and maintained by developers, who can list products in the server's online store. These products must be purchased using the launcher currency "Diamond". Players can choose not to display the in-game mall. The Java version of online games has the same range as single player games.

For the first time entering the server, you need to download a client other than the game version. For a single online game, players can create up to 3 character profiles, and any ban imposed due to game account violations also takes effect on all character profiles.

; Online Lobby

The online lobby of the Windows version is the same as that of the mobile version, both of which are real-time bedrock version gameplay servers. The online lobby of the Windows version is not compatible with the mobile version.

; Local Online

Local online allows players to create any single player game version of the game room, including Java, Rock, and Light Chase versions. With the homeowner's device as the host, any version of the room can be configured with components. When members enter, they download them on the startup interface, and the game can be played directly after it starts.

; Rental Servers

Rental server is a Java version of server hosting service, which has two types: pure rental service and custom rental service. Pure rental server is a fully original game server, with customizable components, plugins, and other additional content to provide higher server performance. The custom rental service channel is currently under maintenance and cannot be created.

* Pure rental clothing specifications

* 10 people: 1800 diamonds per month

* 20 people: 3600 diamonds per month

* 40 people: 5000 diamonds per month

The server owner has operator privileges and can also backup archives to restore previously saved archives at any time. Unlike the mobile version, the PC game rental service allows for downloading archives locally.

==== Game Center ====
[[File:Mccn-youxizhongxin.png|thumb|right|Game Center GUI]]
The Game Center is an online game platform within the PC version of the game launcher, which allows you to quickly classify and filter online games and play them.

==== Component Center ====
[[File:Mccn-zujianzhongxin.png|thumb|right|Component Center page]]
The Component Center is a game add-on content distribution platform within the Windows version launcher, similar to [[Marketplace|Market]].

The configurable components of single player games in the Windows version are divided into two categories based on their impact on the game: functional and visual. Visual is further divided into two subcategories: material sic and light and shadow. The above components can be retrieved in the Component Center by version, price, theme, etc. Online games, online gameplay, and more can also be found and purchased in the component center. Slightly different from the international Java version skin, the 128/256 pixel skin component can also be used for Java games.

===== Component Package =====
A component package is composed of several functional and visual components combined to achieve specific game effects, similar to an integration package. Component packages are mainly provided by the community, and any player can filter, edit, and submit their purchased components. Excellent component packages can be recommended by the community.

==== Other ====
===== Social Communities =====
[[File:Mccn-wanjiashequ.png|thumb|right|Social community GUI]]
The Desktop Edition has the main social functions of the mobile version, and the communities of the two versions are interconnected. Fresh news is similar to the community fresh news function of the mobile game version, with dynamic content exchange. The game forum is also linked to the official forum, and players can use NetEase Pass to directly create forum accounts.

===== Game Forums =====
[[File:Mccn-youxiluntan.png|thumb|right|Game forum GUI]]
The game forum is linked to the official forum, and players can use NetEase Pass to directly create a forum account.

===== Activity Center =====
[[File:Mccn-huodongzhongxin.png|thumb|right|Activity Center GUI]]
The activity center is where the game activities are located. The permanent activities include daily login, redemption center, gift package store, and first-charge gifts. All of them are interconnected with the mobile game version data.

===== Unboxing =====
The unboxing page is where unboxing activities are located. Regular activities include legendary unboxing, gem secrets, and crystal secrets. All of them are interconnected with the mobile game version.

===== Storage =====
In the storage, you can view and use all kinds of launcher resources and props of players. Including: components, cards, portrait frames, activities, chat bubbles, name widgets. All are interoperable with the mobile version data.

===== Level System =====
