'''Caves & Cliffs: Explorers''' is an animated short, made to promote and serve as a prequel to the map of the [[Caves & Cliffs Explorers|same name]], telling the story of the [[Collapse]].

== Summary ==
The video opens on a [[Rain|rainy]] night in the [[village]], where the Engineer is hard at work in their lab. A nearby seismometer in their laboratory begins to go off, concerning the Engineer. Meanwhile under the town, several miners are working to harvest [[Copper Ore|copper ore]] in the [[mineshaft]] featured in the map. As many miners work to distribute [[Raw Copper|raw copper]] into [[Minecart with Chest|minecarts with chests]], an earthquake suddenly catches everyone off guard, knocking a miner off a bridge and holding on for dear life.

While trying to save themself, the [[minecart]] falls off, scattering its contents as people throughout the mine try to evacuate. It eventually falls into a [[canyon]], nearly hitting two miners trying to stay clear of [[lava]]. Unfortunately, a third miner ends up falling in alongside it. Back on the surface, the Engineer hurries out of their house, horrified to see the village collapsing into a sinkhole. An [[Iron Golem|iron golem]] tries to help, carrying several villagers in a panic as others flee, however it too falls into a hole and tosses the villagers away to higher ground. Bracing for impact, the iron golem appears to fall right on top of a miner.

As the dust settles, [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] appear, horrified at what had transpired. Looking up from the dark, several survivors try to compose themselves, ending on a shot of the town as it appears in the map, the Mayor looking outward.

== Trivia ==

* Among the equipment in the Engineer's laboratory is a [[camera]].
* Although effectively the protagonist of the video, the Engineer is absent from the map itself. However, its model can be found unused, with a speech bubble referencing a [[Sculk Sensor|sculk sensor]], suggesting it was cut due to its delay.
