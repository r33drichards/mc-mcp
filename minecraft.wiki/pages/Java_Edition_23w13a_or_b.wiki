'''23w13a_or_b''', supposedly the first and only snapshot for the '''Vote Update''', is an [[April Fools' Day jokes#2023|April Fools' joke snapshot]], released on April 1, 2023,<ref name="offical-announcement">{{Mcnet|vote-update|Introducing: The Vote Update|April 1, 2023|Per Landin}}</ref> which, as the primary focus, adds a system where players vote for gameplay features or mechanics to be implemented. This snapshot is a fork of [[23w13a]].

The snapshot was reuploaded about three hours after the release, to fix some crashes related to transformations and to remove various vulgar color names.<ref>{{tweet|slicedlime|1642152806248226821|Looks like you folks were voting for some crashes! Not too much fun - we've published a new version. Re-start your launcher and game to get the new version of the snapshot|April 1, 2023}}</ref>

* When entered, it [[Teleportation|teleports]] the player 500 blocks up in the air, and returns the message '''''"Error 404 Terrain Not Found"'''''.
** If an other portal is created above Y = 150, it teleports the player to Y = 650, so the player is not teleported to the Moon.
* Drops nothing when broken, similar to the other portal blocks in the game.
* A reference to the mod [https://aether.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Aether The Aether], as well as numerous memes of people trying to unsuccessfully create an Aether portal in vanilla Minecraft.

'''[[File:Pickaxe Block (S).png|32px]] [[Pickaxe block]]'''
* Must be unlocked by vote <code>minecraft:pickaxe_block</code>.

* The block's texture references the [https://twitter.com/alivejy_/status/1642536161200463874 old menus] from [[Pocket Edition|Minecraft: Pocket Edition]].

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Bit.png|32px]] [[Bit]]'''
* Can be obtained by using a [[Tag (item)|tag]] or a [[Tag (item)|name]] item on a [[stonecutter]].

* Drinking it when the player have an active status effect turns it into a potion relating to that status effect and removes the effect from the player.

* Gives the [[Big]] status effect to [[entities]], which increases their size.
* Has a level II variant.

=== Non-mob entities ===

'''[[Stencil Display]]'''{{more info}}

=== World generation ===
'''[[The Moon]]'''
*A new [[dimension]].
*Can be accessed by ascending to Y=700 in the [[Overworld]] or teleporting with <code>/execute as @s in minecraft:the_moon run tp @s ~ ~ ~</code>.
*Ascending to Y=700 on the Moon will bring the player back to the Overworld.
*The gravity is lower compared to the other three dimensions.
*[[Entities]] and [[particles]] will float, being affected by the lower gravity as well.
*[[Lunar base]]s generate there.
*Instead of [[Moon]], the Earth is visible on the sky. There are 4 variants of the Earth shapes when viewed from the moon: [[File:Square Earth.png|32px]] square, [[File:3D Square Earth.png|32px]] cube, [[File:Round Earth.png|32px]] round, [[File:Tea Pot Earth.png|32px]] teapot.
*The square Earth is the default shape. The variant can be changed by vote <code>minecraft:world_shape</code>.
*The teapot Earth is the rarest variant of Earth shape.
*On the Moon, player can build blocks from Y=0 up to Y=255, like in [[the End]].
*A player suffocates on the Moon like underwater, albeit much slower. They need to consume [[Air (April Fools joke)|air]], eat [[cheese]] or stand in [[packed air]] to stay alive. [[Water Breathing]] effect does not prevent suffocation on the Moon.
*Both [[bed]]s and [[respawn anchors]] explode, like in the End.

'''[[File:Lunar Base.png|32px]] [[Lunar base]]'''

*Exists as a new bar, placed over the [[hunger]] bar.
*Decreases as the player performs certain actions, similar to hunger.
*Can be refilled by drinking water bottles, or by swimming underwater for long periods of time.

'''Voting system'''
*About every 2 minutes, a "proposal" will be created, and can be accessed and voted on by pressing {{key|V}}.
**This will bring up a prompt to change how the world works, in which the player voting has some options. 
***One of these options will be "Do Nothing" unless {{Cd|minecraft:new_vote_no_opt_out}} has been voted.
***Whichever change was voted for the most will be executed, unless another vote has changed the way the winning option is chosen.
***Proposals are either approving or repealing. The former prompt the players to add new rules and the latter prompt them to deactivate the active ones.

=== Commands ===

*<code>wob</code>
**Items with this tag will have a flipped sprite and name.
**Items with this tag will have reversed knockback (mobs are knocked towards the player)

'''{{cmd|vote|link=none}}'''
*Syntax: 
**{{cd|vote dump_all [short{{!}}long]}} - Returns the message "Whew! That was scary!" as command feedback.
***{{cd|short}} - {{info needed}}
***{{cd|long}} - {{info needed}}
**{{cd|vote io (flush{{!}}reload)}}.
***{{cd|flush}} - Forces all voting data to be saved to their file and removes them from temporary memory. Also prints the message {{cd|ThreadedAnvilChunkStorage: Hey, how are you?}} to the console.
***{{cd|reload}} - Reloads the file that contains all voting data. If the file was edited before reloading, all changes made to the voting data will be applied to the world.

***{{cd|start <rule>}} - Starts voting for activation of the specified rule. Arguments for the rule are random.
***{{cd|repeal <rule>}} - Starts voting for repeal of the specified rule.
***{{cd|finish <<nowiki/>vote>}} - Finishes ongoing votes and activates the rules in response to the voting results. {{cd|vote}} must be a [[UUID]] of a ongoing vote. Specifying {{cd|*}} finishes all ongoing votes.

***Manipulate rules that are usually decided by vote. {{cd|?}} uses a random rule and {{cd|*}} regards all the rules. Players can't approve the vote using {{cd|*}}.
***Specifying {{cd|?}} for arguments corresponding to each rule activates the rules with random arguments.
***Valid rules and their arguments:

**{{Sound|sad1.ogg|Sad1.ogg}}
**{{Sound|sad2.ogg|Sad2.ogg}}
**{{Sound|sad3.ogg|Sad3.ogg}}
**{{Sound|sad4.ogg|Sad4.ogg}}

'''[[Toasts]]'''
*Added a new toast notification that appears every few seconds when the player has not yet opened their voting screen, and a vote proposal has started. The notification title is "New proposal received!" in purple text, while the main message differs depending on how long has passed since the first notification appeared.
**Opening the voting screen once prevents these toasts from ever appearing in the future, unless {{cd|options.txt}} is edited externally.
**These toasts use a value called "urgency" which has four values: {{cd|LOW}}, {{cd|MEDIUM}}, {{cd|CONCERNING}}, {{cd|WHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_IT}}.
**They start at {{cd|LOW}} urgency, which lasts 2 minutes, change to {{cd|MEDIUM}} for 2 minutes, then to {{cd|CONCERNING}} for 1 minute and finally to {{cd|WHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_IT}} until the world is closed or the voting screen is opened.
**The notification's main message changes depending on the level of urgency.
***At {{cd|LOW}} urgency, toasts appear every 15 seconds, last 5 seconds each and can have the following messages:
****Press '''v''' to open voting screen
****To open voting screen, press '''v'''
****New vote started, press '''v''' to cast your vote
***At {{cd|MEDIUM}} urgency, toasts appear every 10 seconds, last 3 seconds each and can have the following messages:
****A new proposal is waiting for your vote, press '''v'''
****Others are having fun while you are not pressing '''v'''
****Time to change some rules, press '''v'''
****You have new vote proposals to review, press '''v''' to access!
***At {{cd|CONCERNING}} urgency, toasts appear every 5 seconds, last 2 seconds each and can have the following messages:
****Ok, so the whole idea of this release is to vote, so press '''v'''
****Somebody wants to tell you what you can and can not do, press '''v''' to prevent that
****At this point you are probably just waiting to see what happens next. Fine! But you can avoid that by pressing '''v'''.
****If you can't find '''v''', it's probably on your keyboard
****Not pressing '''v''' has been proven less fun that pressing '''v'''<!--intentional typo, "that" instead of "than"-->
****Do you want more phantoms? That's how you get more phantoms! Press '''v'''
****Please, just press '''v''' and be done with it!
****Hot votes in your area! Press '''v'''
***At {{cd|WHY_ARE_YOU_NOT_DOING_IT}} urgency, toasts appear every half a second, last 1 second each and can have the following messages:
****PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' PRESS '''v''' 
****WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY NO '''v'''
****DO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE '''v''' IS!?
****gfdgh bbtvsvtfgfsgb a '''v'''jhrst ujs  t 452423 r<!--yes, this message is just keyboard-smashing, this actually appears, I copied it from the code-->
****Press '''v''' to open voting screen<!--this is the same as in LOW urgency, I didn't make a mistake-->
****<span style="color:#F55">AAAAAAA</span> '''v''' <span style="color:#55F">AAAAAAA!</span>
*****The red and blue parts of this message are obfuscated.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart]]'''
*[[File:Minecart with Wheels.png|32px]] Voting for <code>wheels_on_minecarts</code> will give minecarts 3D wheels.

=== General ===
'''[[Resource pack]]'''

**A French (France) language file ({{cd|fr_fr.json}}), which contains translations for most of the stuff added in this snapshot.
**Four sound files ({{cd|d=to|sad1.ogg|sad4.ogg}}) used by {{cd|minecraft:the_joke}} vote rule.

== Trivia ==
*[[Bartosz Bok]] showed a video of a minecart with 3D wheels in 2020.<ref>{{Tweet|0x00716F62|1283415852348571648|What if?}}</ref>
*The Wob item appears to be a reference to a common crafting misconception. A post about this was made on Twitter that tagged the YouTuber PhoenixSC, who made a concept for this and seems to be the inspiration for the feature.<ref name=":0" /><ref>https://twitter.com/StrangerGEMS/status/1353909874661285888</ref>
*The "Trails & Tails" rule could also be a reference to a PhoenixSC video based off a misspelling of the update's title in an official article. The typo since has been fixed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osTk1jsT_XM</ref><ref>{{mcnet|minecraft-launching-chromebook|Minecraft Launching Chromebook|March 15, 2023|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
*The [https://xkcd.com/color/rgb.txt list of colors used for biome colors for voting] originally contained inappropriate color names. However, these were removed after the reupload three hours later.
*Rule {{cd|uncontrolable_lave}} and {{cd|fire_sponge}} contain a misspelling of lava, based off a bug that appeared in [[22w44a]].<ref>{{bug|MC-257104}}</ref>
*The inedible names of the [[tropical fish]] and [[rabbit stew]]  [10] are references to movies, the [[tropical fish]]'s inedible name being a reference to {{w|Finding Nemo}}, and the [[rabbit stew]]'s inedible name being a reference to {{w|Who Framed Roger Rabbit}}.
*The inedible cake being named “lies” is a reference to ''[[Wikipedia:Portal (game)|Portal]]'', much like [[The Lie]].
