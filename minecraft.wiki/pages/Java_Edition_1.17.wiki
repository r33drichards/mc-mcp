'''1.17''', the first release of '''[[Caves & Cliffs]],''' is a major update to {{JE}} announced at [[Minecraft Live 2020]]<ref name="Recap">{{Mcnet|minecraft-live-the-recap|Minecraft Live: The Recap|October 3, 2020}}</ref> and released on June 8, 2021.<ref name="Announced"> This update adds [[amethyst geode]]s along with amethyst blocks and items, [[copper ore]] and its derived forms, [[deepslate]] and its variants, and the [[goat]], [[glow squid]], and [[axolotl]] mobs.</ref>

On April 14, 2021, Mojang Studios announced that the update would be split into two updates due to the amount and complexity of content, as well as team health.<ref>{{Mcnet|a-caves---cliffs-announcement|A Caves & Cliffs Announcement}}</ref> Multiple features such as revamped [[mountain]] and [[cave]] generation, and increased world height were removed in [[21w15a]], and were subsequently released in [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]].<ref>{{cite|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20210414155447/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360059400852|title=Minecraft: Caves & Cliffs Update FAQ (Archived from the original on April 14, 2021)|website=feedback.minecraft.net}}</ref> A [[data pack]] was included in the [[Minecraft.net]] article for 21w15a that re-enabled the removed features, and subsequent snapshots updated this data pack.

'''{{Animate|Pointed Dripstone Tip (D) JE1 BE1.png; Pointed Dripstone Tip Merge (D) JE1 BE1.png; Pointed Dripstone Frustum (D) JE1 BE1.png; Pointed Dripstone Middle (D) JE1 BE1.png; Pointed Dripstone Base (D) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Pointed dripstone]]'''
* Can be either placed on a ceiling to create a stalactite or on top of a block to create a stalagmite.
** Can be combined to form longer stalactites and stalagmites.
* Thrown [[trident]]s break pointed dripstone. They also break when pushed directly or with a block by a [[piston]].
* Stalagmites break if not attached to something below. 
* Stalagmites hurt [[entities]] that fall on top of them more than normal fall damage.
** Damage is relative to height: For example, jumping on a stalagmite deals {{hp|2}} of damage, and falling from 3 blocks deals {{hp|8}} of damage.
* Stalactites can fall or break if unsupported, and break apart on impact, hurting entities they fall on.
** Damage is relative to height: For example, one falling from 2 blocks deals {{hp|2}} of damage, and one falling from 3 blocks deal {{hp|4}} of damage.
** They drip [[water]] or [[lava]] into [[cauldron]]s if a source block is placed above the stalactite, and gradually fill the cauldron. Water drips even without any water above the block (as does lava in [[the Nether]]) but this effect alone does not fill the cauldron.
* If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a water source above, it slowly grows both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below.
** Growth speed is random but very slow; a single growth step can take several in-game days.

'''{{Animate|Potted Azalea JE1 BE1.png; Potted Flowering Azalea JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Potted azalea]]'''
* Obtained by planting an [[azalea]] into a pot.

'''[[File:Powder Snow JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Powder snow]]'''
* A variant of snow, [[entities]] that walk over it sink into it.
* [[Leather boots]] can be worn to prevent entities from sinking into powder snow blocks.<!--Tested, works with anything that can have armor items, including mobs that normally don't wear armor, like cows.-->
** [[Player]]s can still [[crouch]] to descend with leather boots. Wearing leather boots also allows powder snow to be "climbed", like [[water]] or [[scaffolding]]. They also prevent fall damage when landing on powder snow.
** [[Leather horse armor]] also protects [[horse]]s from freeze damage.
* When inside a powder snow block, a frosty vignette appears around the player's screen and any entity (with the exception of [[stray]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[snow golem]]s, and [[wither]]s) inside starts freezing and taking damage after a short time.
** Wearing any piece of [[leather armor]] stops the freeze effect.
* Can be collected and placed with a [[bucket]]. {{ItemSprite|Powder Snow Bucket}}
* Entities on fire melt powder snow when colliding.

'''[[File:Rooted Dirt JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Rooted dirt]]'''
* A dirt-like decorative block with roots on its texture.
* Similar to [[coarse dirt]], neither [[mycelium]] nor [[grass]] spread to it.
* {{Control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on any side grows [[hanging roots]] underneath.
* Tilling rooted dirt with a hoe now converts it into dirt, and pops out hanging roots.

'''{{Animate|Sculk Sensor JE1.gif; Sculk Sensor BE2.gif|32px}} [[Sculk sensor]]'''
* A redstone component that detects vibrations.
* Currently, it does not generate naturally, available only from commands such as {{cmd|give}}, but natural generation is planned for future versions.
* Senses vibrations such as block placement, footsteps, and projectiles, and emits a redstone signal.
* [[File:Vibration JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] Emits particles when it senses a vibration nearby.
* A [[comparator]] connected to it emits different signal strengths based on what caused the signal.
* Does not detect ambient [[weather]] such as [[rain]].
* [[Wool]] blocks between the sensor and the cause of the sound prevent the sensor from detecting the sound.

'''[[File:Smooth Basalt JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Smooth basalt]]'''
* A [[basalt]] variant that composes the outer layer of amethyst geodes.
* Can be obtained by smelting basalt.

'''{{Animate|Spore Blossom JE1.png; Spore Blossom JE1 (facing NWU).png|32px}} [[Spore blossom]]'''
* Available only in [[Creative]] or in [[buffet]] / [[custom]] worlds with the currently unused [[lush caves]] biome.
* Can be placed only on the underside of a block.
* Sends green particles downward when opened.

'''[[File:Tinted Glass JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Tinted glass]]'''
* A black variant of glass that is transparent to players, but does not let light through.
* Can be crafted with 4 amethyst shards and a glass block.
** Stained glass cannot be used to craft tinted glass.
