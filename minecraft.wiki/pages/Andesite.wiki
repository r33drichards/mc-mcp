'''Andesite''' is a [[block]] of igneous [[rock]], most often found in [[ore (feature)|large pockets]] in the ground.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Andesite can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Andesite|Pickaxe|Wood|link=none}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
Andesite can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. Andesite attempts to generate in two batches. The first batch generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60, in all biomes. The second batch has {{frac|1|6}} chance to generate blobs of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. {{IN|BE}}, andesite can replace stone, diorite, granite, polished andesite, polished diorite and polished granite. {{IN|JE}}, andesite can replace stone, diorite, granite, tuff and deepslate.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, andesite generates naturally in [[coral reef]]s, replacing some [[coral]] as part of coral crusts.

== Usage ==
Andesite has the same [[blast resistance]] as [[stone]], meaning it can be used as a substitute for stone when building.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Andesite}}

== Trivia ==
* In the real world, {{w|andesite}} rock comes from above-ground {{w|lava flow}}s. Finding andesite underground means the world's surface used to be lower, and the lava flow was buried.
** {{w|Diorite}} is andesite's below-ground equivalent: The two rocks come from the same kind of {{w|magma}}, but diorite rocks are formed from solidifying underground {{w|magma chamber}}s. The long, slow cool makes it look coarser than andesite.
