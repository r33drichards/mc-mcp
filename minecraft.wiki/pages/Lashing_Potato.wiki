== Usage ==
{{control|Using}} a lashing potato fires a vine-like object that travels directly forward until it comes in contact with a block. Once it does, it attaches itself to the block and pulls the player toward that spot. A player reaching the attached block stays in that spot and hangs from the lashing potato. Using the lashing potato again detaches the vine-like object.
