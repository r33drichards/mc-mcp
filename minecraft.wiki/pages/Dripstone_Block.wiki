The '''dripstone block''' is a [[rock]] block that allows [[pointed dripstone]] to grow beneath it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A dripstone block requires a [[pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Dripstone (feature)}}
Dripstone blocks can be found in [[dripstone caves]]. They can generate on the floor, the ceiling, as stalactites, stalagmites, or stalagnates (joined stalactite and stalagmite). They can generate underwater.

== Usage ==
Dripstone blocks are used primarily for decoration.

{{main|Pointed Dripstone#Stalactites}}
If a stalactite is hanging from a dripstone block with a [[water]] source above, it slowly grows both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below.
