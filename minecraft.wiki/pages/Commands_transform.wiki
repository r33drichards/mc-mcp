{{cmd|transform}} is an April Fools' command added in snapshot [[Java_Edition_23w13a_or_b|23w13a_or_b]], which can be used to transform the user in a few ways: either turning them into a mob, giving them the skin of any other player, or changing their scale.

Different transformations can be stacked, such as transforming into an [[Allay]] and then setting the user's scale to 2.0 resulting in a large Allay.

== Syntax ==
: <code>transform into <entity></code>
:: Transforms the user into the entity specified.
: <code>transform into player <player></code>
:: Applies the skin of the specified player to the user. (Note: <code>transform into minecraft:player</code> does not do the same.)
: <code>transform scale <scale></code>
:: Scales the user up or down to the specified scale. Must be between 0.1 and 16.0.
: <code>transform clear</code>
:: Clears all current transformations.
