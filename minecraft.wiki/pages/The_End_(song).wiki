{{Q|“The End” is a 15 minute piece for the namesake in Minecraft, a place called “The End”, a dark and sinister place full of creepy things called Endermen. Oh, and there’s a dragon. Since The End is also the final stage the player has to go to to “beat” the game, this piece contains a lot of references to past songs. If you listen closely, you can essentially hear most of Volume Alpha embedded within. After building up the drone, the song breaks, as if some sort of audio device couldn’t handle it anymore. Lastly you hear someone fixing it, and it starts from the beginning. At least in the game.|C418|c418.org}}

== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:The end.ogg]]

"The End" is heavily built on modified versions of several tracks from ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]''.<ref>[https://genius.com/C418-the-end-lyrics#about - Genius's description Genius.com on "The End"]</ref>. The track opens with vinyl static and the beginning part of the track "[[Minecraft (song)|Minecraft]]", which slowly becomes more and more distorted and reverbed until it is barely recognizable. After it suddenly succumbs to excessive [[wikipedia:bitcrushing|bitcrushing]] and glitching, it echoes out, and a low-pitched drone starts and grows slowly, eventually gaining a harmony of choir voices as the track becomes a very dark ambient piece with an ominous air of desolation and hopelessness.

Throughout the track, extremely distorted and/or remixed versions of parts of the tracks "[[Music Disc cat|Cat]]", "[[Haggstrom]]", "[[Dry Hands]]", "[[Wet Hands]]", "[[Équinoxe]]", "[[Subwoofer Lullaby]]", "[[Oxygène]]", and "[[Danny]]" from ''Minecraft - Volume Alpha'' can be heard, as ambient noises play in the background and build in intensity. The track slowly increases in volume as new layers of sounds fade in until it becomes much louder.

At the climax of this piece, a pulsing, one-note synth [[wikipedia:ostinato|ostinato]] suddenly appears from the drone and is overlaid with a half-tempo rendition of the song "[[Sweden]]", which greatly increases in volume until the melody is overtaken by the choir and it abruptly stops with a [[wikipedia:Motif_(music)|motif]] from "Subwoofer Lullaby" and echoes out.

After a period of relative silence, the drone and ambience reappears, accompanied by soft, echoing chimes layered with reversed chimes, and then a sudden static hum brings in some very slowed down samples from "Minecraft".

The drone slowly fades away as an ambient wind sound comes in waves, and this wind sound continues for some time.

Then, the drone and ostinato quietly return for a very short time before another static hum interrupts the track and there is total silence, except for vinyl static.

A stuttered loop of a small portion of "Minecraft" begins, once again underneath a layer of vinyl static. An individual can be heard stopping the track by pushing a button on a turntable, and nothing but vinyl static can be heard for the remaining few seconds.

On [[Legacy Console Edition]], the track was shortened to 6:55, trimming many longer sections of the song and shortening the beginning where "Minecraft" corrupts.
