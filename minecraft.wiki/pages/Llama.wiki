A '''llama''' is a [[Taming#List of mobs|tameable]] [[neutral mob]] that can be equipped with a [[chest]] to transport [[item]]s, and can also wear [[carpet]]s. If attacked, it will retaliate using its [[spit]].

== Spawning ==
A llama spawns above on [[grass block]]s in [[savanna plateau]], [[savanna]]{{only|be|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-159092||Llamas do not spawn in regular savanna biome|WAI}}</ref> or [[windswept savanna]]{{only|be|short=1}} [[biome]]s in herds of 4 llamas, and in [[windswept hills]], [[windswept forest]], and [[windswept gravelly hills]] biomes in herds of 4 to 6 llamas, coming in four coat colors: brown, cream, white or gray.

10% of llamas spawn as baby llamas.

* Any equipped {{blockLink|carpets|link=Carpet}} and {{BlockLink|chest}}.

*{{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs if killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

Like other baby animals, killing a baby llama yields no [[item]] or [[experience]].

== Behavior ==
Llamas are [[neutral mobs]] that retaliate when attacked by a [[player]] or another [[mob]]. Occasionally, their [[spit]] can miss its intended target and accidentally hit another llama, causing them to fight each other. 

Llamas are hostile toward wolves and spit without provocation, but they don't attack tamed wolves unless provoked. Wolves are fearful of llamas of [[#Data values|strength]] 4 or 5 and always run away, and won't attack unless provoked by their spit.<ref>{{Bug|MC-107643||Wolf is indecisive around llamas while hostile toward the llama.|WAI}}</ref> Wolves flee from weaker llamas less often.

Llamas are completely passive in [[Peaceful]] difficulty.

Llamas float when in water deeper than two blocks.

Llamas can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Llamas also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}). If an entity is riding a llama, they receive the same fall damage as the llama.

Llamas have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

Unlike other neutral mobs, llamas don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

=== Spitting ===
{{anchor|Llama spit}}
{{main|Llama Spit|title1=Llama spit}}
Llamas attack other mobs by spitting at them, dealing {{hp|1}} [[damage]]. [[Llama Spit|Llama spit]] is not flammable. {{IN|bedrock}}, like other [[projectiles]], it can be thrown back at the llama.

=== Taming ===
Llamas can be tamed by repetitively riding them until hearts are displayed, done by pressing {{control|use}} on the llama while holding nothing.

Taming success depends on the llama's <code>Temper</code> value. <code>Temper</code> is a positive trait, with higher values increasing the chance of successful taming. Llamas begin with a <code>Temper</code> value of 0 and a maximum of 30. When a player rides an untamed llama, a random number from 0 to 29 is chosen. The llama gets tamed successfully if this number is less than the <code>Temper</code> value, otherwise, the <code>Temper</code> is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. <code>Temper</code> can also be increased by feeding the llama.

Tamed llamas do not spit at mobs that attack its owner, although it spits at any mob that attacks the llama. Tamed llamas can still retaliate at players should the player hit them.

Feeding a llama food can alter its behavior, increasing its temper value if untamed, restoring lost health or making a baby grow faster (babies ordinarily take around 20 minutes to mature to adults). The table below lists the effects of the 2 food items llamas accept.

A llama can be fed by holding a valid food item and pressing {{control|use}} while facing the llama. Llamas can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. If the food is invalid, the player mounts the llama instead.

=== Breeding ===
Adult tamed llamas can be bred by being fed a [[hay bale]]. The baby llama takes on the coat color of one parent at random. Its strength is chosen as a random integer between 1 and the strength of the stronger parent, inclusive. 3% of the time the resulting strength is increased by 1, but it is capped at 5.

|-
!5
| 19.4%||20% ||20%||20%||20.6%
|}

Select a row based on the stronger parent. The column shows the probability of the resulting offspring having a given strength.  

A llama's base health ({{hp|15}} to {{hp|30}}) is calculated based on that of its parents, in the same way as a [[horse]]'s.

Color variant of llama is randomly selected between parents.

When breeding a trader llama with a normal llama, the offspring will always be a normal llama. The offspring of a pair of trader llamas will be a trader llama.

=== Caravans ===
Llamas form a caravan when one of them is [[lead|leashed]] by a [[player]].

Leashing a llama causes up to nine nearby llamas that are not already in a caravan to follow it, forming a caravan of up to ten llamas. When multiple llamas are leashed, each leashed llama can lead its own caravan of up to ten llamas. A caravan cannot contain more than one leashed llama, and there is no limit to the number of caravans a player can lead.

=== Storage ===
[[File:Llama GUI Strength 4.png|thumb|right|The GUI of a llama with strength 4 and with a chest.]]
A tamed llama can be equipped with a [[chest]] by pressing the {{control|use}} control on it while holding a chest. The chest gives the llama 3 to 15 slots of inventory space, depending on its strength (see table below). Once equipped, its contents can be accessed by pressing the {{control|use}} control on the llama while [[sneaking]], or by opening the inventory while riding the llama. The chest itself cannot be retrieved without [[killing]] the llama.

=== Carpets ===
[[File:All Llama swag patterns.png|thumb|right|350px|All llama carpet patterns.]]
A tamed llama can be equipped with a wool [[carpet]] in its carpet slot. Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug when on the llama's back. This can be useful for color-coding the llamas as storage containers, like dyed [[shulker box]]es.

When given carpets, all types of llamas look the same, except for their fur colors. {{IN|java}}, a llama's carpet decoration, including the default blue rug of a trader llama, remains visible when the llama is under the effect of [[Invisibility]];<ref>{{bug|MC-110423||Invisibility effect don't affect the second layer skins of stray and llama|WAI}}</ref> {{in|bedrock}}, it becomes invisible.

For the purposes of the {{cmd|item}} [[Commands|command]], a llama carries its carpet in the <code>armor.body</code> slot.

== Trivia ==
*The ''[[So I Got That Going for Me]]'' achievement title refers to the 1980 comedy movie ''{{Wikipedia|Caddyshack}}'', where Bill Murray tells a story of how he once caddied for the Dalai Lama. In return, on his deathbed he expects to receive total consciousness, thus uttering the line "So I got that going for me, which is nice".
*Some carpets on a llama's back represent certain mobs; a green carpet uses the face of the green [[creeper]], while a purple carpet gains eyes like those of an [[enderman]]. A llama wearing a gray carpet has a mask, similar to that of a superhero or a bandit.
*The llama was the first mob that [[Agnes Larsson]] designed. She visited a real-life llama named Adrian to use as a model.<ref>{{ytl|f0k7JNFGhms|Growth & Evolution - Part 3 {{!}} 15 Years of Minecraft @ 3:47|Minecraft|June 5, 2024|t=227s}}</ref>
