== Trivia ==
* In real life, [[wikipedia:Mudbrick|mud bricks]] are made with mud mixed together with straw, and then heated to increase their toughness, which is referenced by the [[crafting]] recipe of packed mud in ''[[Minecraft]]''. They have a long history of being used as building materials, dating back at least 5,000 years.
