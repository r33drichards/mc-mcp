The '''warped forest''' is an uncommon forested [[biome]] found in [[the Nether]]. [[Endermen]] are common in this biome, and hostile mobs do not spawn naturally. It is one of [[Crimson Forest|two]] Nether biomes where players are able to acquire [[Wood (disambiguation)|wood]] without returning to the Overworld.

== Description ==
The warped forest is the rarest of the five biomes in the Nether, making up around 8% of the Nether by volume. The warped forest can generate next to any other Nether biome except for [[soul sand valley]]s.

The warped forest is dense and has a cyan color scheme. The forest's fog and particles have a deep blue tone, and the fog appears lilac with [[Night Vision]].

The floor of the biome is composed mostly of [[warped nylium]], with some [[netherrack]] and [[warped wart block]]s generating on the surface. The biome's natural vegetation includes [[Nether fungi]], [[warped roots]], [[huge warped fungi]], and [[twisting vines]] growing from the ground. Large overhangs extend over the oceans of lava. Blobs of glowstone generate in the ceiling, and shroomlights generate on the huge fungus scattered around the forest.

[[Endermen]] spawn most commonly here, albeit at [[Mob spawning#Java Edition mob cap|much lower density]] than in [[the End]]. The only other mob that can spawn naturally here are [[strider]]s; however, hostile mobs may still spawn in [[Nether fortress]]es and [[bastion remnant]]s.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:

{{Spawn table
|edition=java
|creature=
{{Spawn row|Strider|weight=60|size=2-4|charge=—|budget=—|note=Adult striders have a 3.3% chance to spawn being ridden by a zombified piglin holding a warped fungus on a stick.}}
|monster=
{{Spawn row|Enderman|weight=1|size=1-4|charge=1.0|budget=0.12}}
}}

{{Spawn table
|edition=bedrock

{{Spawn row|Strider|weight=20|size=2-4| note=Adult striders have a 3.3% chance to spawn being ridden by a zombified piglin holding a warped fungus on a stick.}}
|monster=
{{Spawn row|Enderman|weight=16|size=1}}
}}

== Sounds ==
=== Music ===
The warped forest is one of the two biomes in the game devoid of music (the other one being the [[pale garden]]). However, music can be added to the biome with [[resource pack]]s.

=== Ambience ===
Nether ambience plays while the [[player]] is in [[the Nether]].

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* When Warped forests were announced at [[MINECON Live 2019]], which happened before the first Nether Update snapshot was released, these forests were referred to as "Blue Nether wart forests". In the announcement, however, they were called by the name "Nether wart forest blue".
* The ambience sound "Warped Forest Addition 6" is the sound of an enderman screaming, slowed down and in reverse.
** Similarly, "Warped Forest Additions 1-5" are a mix of regular enderman sounds and those of [[MCD:Enderman|endermen]] from ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]''.
* When discussing the ambience of warped forests, [[Samuel Åberg]], ''[[Minecraft]]'''s lead sound designer, stated that "something in the forest disrupts reality."<ref>{{ytl|BPJOs8nFMv0h|Dev Diaries #2: Nether Sound|Minecraft|t=25}}</ref>
