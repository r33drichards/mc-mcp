[[File:HUD example.png|thumb|350px|The HUD as seen in Survival mode.]]

The '''heads-up display (HUD)''' is a system showing the [[player]]'s conditions. It is superimposed on their view of the game world.

== Display ==
[[File:HUD.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The most common bars in the HUD. Clockwise starting from the bottom left: the experience bar, the health bar, the armor bar, the oxygen bar, and the hunger bar.]]
The HUD typically consists of the user's [[health]], [[hunger]] and [[experience]] bars, the hotbar, as well as a crosshair that designates the currently focused on block or entity if the player is not playing on a mobile device and has not enabled split controls. The [[armor]] condition bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor, and the [[Damage#Drowning|oxygen]] bar displays above the hunger bar if the player's air supply unit is below 300.{{note|Represented in {{nbt|short|Air}} NBT tag on [[entity format]].}} Note that in the mobile versions of ''Bedrock Edition'', the health and armor bars are on the top left and the hunger and oxygen bars are on the top right. The "[[Settings#Video|UI Profile]]" option under the video settings can be set to "Classic" mode to match ''Java Edition'' style.

In [[Creative]] mode, the health, hunger, oxygen, experience and armor bars are hidden.

{{notelist}}
=== Hotbar ===
[[File:Hotbar.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The hotbar.]]
[[File:Hotbar (BE).png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The hotbar {{in|be}} when using touch controls.]]
The hotbar is a selection bar that appears on the bottom of the screen. It is where the player stores and selects commonly used [[items]]. It consists of the bottom nine slots within the player's inventory. When the player switches an item in hand by mouse wheel or {{key|1-9}}, its name is shown above the experience level for a short period of time. {{IN|je}}, this name appears in italics, while {{In|be}}, the text has a black background and also shows [[enchantments]] of the selected item, and contents of a [[Shulker Box|shulker box]]. The background opacity can be adjusted with the "Text Background Opacity" option in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]]. The slots of the hotbar are the programmer art sand texture slightly darkened.

Players can [[dual wield]] allowing a second item to be shown on the other side, along with an additional hotbar slot on the same side.{{Only|je|short=1}} Both the slot and the item are shown only if it contains an item, which can either be added using the [[GUI]] or by pressing "{{control|swap items}}".

{{IN|bedrock}}, the hotbar has an additional button for the inventory when using touch controls. On the [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]], the hotbar is located on the "Touch Screen" and is slightly different.

=== Hand ===
The player's hand is always shown on the right side of the screen (left side if the player's main hand is set to "left"),{{only|java|short=1}} and corresponds to the player's hand in the [[skin]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, all animations from the hand as seen in third person are also seen on the HUD, including the breathing animation and eating/drinking. When an item in the hotbar is selected, it shows in place of the hand rotated similarly to held items in third-person, with a switching animation. Some held items can show animations, and when charging a [[crossbow]] in ''Bedrock Edition'', the left hand can also be seen. Items can also be held in the [[offhand]] slot, which will show on the other side, but an empty hand is not shown. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], directional light effects (shadows, caustics, light) are also visible on the hand, and held items apply their texture sets.

The hand can be toggled independently from the HUD in ''Bedrock Edition'', meaning that it can be shown standalone without other HUD elements. However, pressing {{key|F1}} still hides the hand. 

=== Locator bar ===
{{main|Locator Bar}}
[[File:Survival Locator Bar.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|Locator bar in [[Survival]] mode.]]
The locator bar appears in place of the experience bar, except when gaining [[XP]]. It shows the position of other [[player]]s in [[multiplayer]] as colored square indicators, often referred to as waypoints. They appear approximately within 120 degrees of the camera facing towards the target. If the target is on a significantly different Y-level, an arrow pointing to the target vertically appears over the square indicator.

The [[color code|color]] of a waypoint is randomly assigned to a player when they join a multiplayer game, or when a waypoint is tracked for the entity; it may also be assigned by their [[team]] color. In ''Java Edition'', it can be customized using the {{cmd|waypoint}} command.

The locator bar can be toggled by the {{cd|[[Game rule#locatorBar|locatorBar]]}} game rule. In ''Java Edition'', entities in the locator bar may be tracked if {{cd|[[Attribute#waypoint_transmit_range|waypoint_transmit_range]]}} attribute is set.

=== Crosshair ===
The crosshair is a small cross in the middle of the screen. It shows the aim point of the [[tool]] or [[item]] being held to entities or blocks for attacking or any interactions within a specific [[Interaction range|range]] from the player. The crosshair inverts the colors of the area it is upon, which can result in a nearly invisible crosshair if the area is a medium gray. The crosshair is only shown on touch devices when the control mode is set to "Joystick & aim crosshair", or when the "Split Controls" option is enabled.

=== Chat ===
{{Main|Chat}}
Chat messages are also shown on the HUD, in the bottom left corner{{only|java}}/top left corner{{only|bedrock}}, showing anything recently spoken or commands recently executed. {{IN|je}}, this can be expanded with {{key|T}}, allowing the player to enter chat messages or commands, and view the full chat history. {{IN|be}}, pressing {{key|T}} opens the chat menu, which is not part of the HUD but a separate [[menu screen]].

Elements such as the chat size, background opacity, its visibility in general, font, text color, and more can be changed in the [[options]]{{only|java}}/[[Chat#Chat settings|chat settings]].{{only|be}}

=== Closed captions ===
{{Main|Closed captions}}{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}{{In development|be|3=26.0|section=1}}

Closed captions display text for [[sounds]] in-game. When subtitles are turned on, a black box appears in the bottom right corner, which lists sounds in the world that are nearby to the player. If the sounds are offscreen, "<" or ">" point in the direction the sound is coming from. As the sound fades away, the text also fades, becoming less white.

Subtitles can be enabled in the "Music & Sounds" or "Accessibility Settings" sections of the [[options]] menu.

=== Effects ===
{{Main|Effect}}
All [[effect]]s (other than effects with <code>hideParticles</code>, including [[Darkness]] from the warden<ref>{{bug|MC-249416|||WAI}}</ref>) the player currently has are shown on the top-right of the screen. Effects that run out sooner appear farther to the left, and effects that are about to run out start to flash. Additionally, positive effects are shown on the top, and other effects (neutral or negative) are shown on the bottom. Beacon effects have a blue (instead of gray) outline, and effects with particles hidden are not indicated in the HUD.

=== Riding mobs ===
{{fakeImage|{{healthbar|20|mob=1}}|A mob health bar}}
[[File:Horse jump bar empty.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The empty jump bar/dash bar.]] 
[[File:Horse jump bar full.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The full jump bar/dash bar.]]

Upon mounting a [[horse]], [[donkey]], [[mule]], [[llama]], [[pig]], [[strider]], [[camel]], [[happy ghast]], [[nautilus]] or [[zombie nautilus]], the ridden mob's health bar appears above the hunger bar. It uses a slightly different heart texture than the player's health bar, with them made to resemble saddles.

Also, upon mounting a horse, camel, nautilus or zombie nautilus, the jump bar (for horses) or the dash bar (for camels, nautiluses and zombie nautiluses) also appears above the experience bar. When riding a [[skeleton horse]] underwater, the oxygen bar, if necessary, appears above the mob health bar.

=== Action Bar ===
{{Main|Action bar}}
The action bar is a space just above the player's hotbar where text can be displayed. Some gameplay elements, such as [[jukeboxes]], use this to give contextual hints to the player. Text can also be displayed here using the {{cmd|title}} command. {{IN|be}}, the opacity of the black background of the action bar can be adjusted with the "Action Bar Background Opacity" option in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].

=== Autosave indicator ===
{{Main|Autosave}}
[[File:Auto save.png|thumb|The autosave indicator in [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock Edition'']].]]
The autosave indicator indicates when the game is autosaving. In ''[[Java Edition]]'', this is turned on by default and shows "Saving world" in the bottom-right of the screen. In ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', this is turned off by default and shows an animation of an arrow pointing into a [[chest]] in the top-right of the screen.

Whether or not this appears can be toggled in the [[options]].

=== Bossbar ===
{{Main|Bossbar}}
[[File:Bossbar enderdragon.png|thumb|The bossbar for the [[Ender Dragon|ender dragon]].]]
A bossbar is a bar at the top of the screen that can track [[health]] of a [[Mob#Boss mobs|boss mob]] or the total health of [[raid]] mobs. The bossbar appears naturally in the game through three means: during a [[raid]], after constructing a [[wither]], and upon entering [[the End]] if the [[ender dragon]] has not yet been defeated. In [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']], a bossbar can be created manually using the <code>/[[Commands/bossbar|bossbar]]</code> command. There is a limit to the number of bars shown.

=== Screen effects and overlays ===
{{Main|Screen effects}}
Screen effects encompass a variety of effects applied alongside or beneath the heads-up display as augmentations to the [[player]]'s point of view as a method of conveying further information about a player's current state.

=== Screen title ===
{{Main|Commands/title}}
A screen title is displayed to players as a single line of large center-aligned text in the middle of their displays, and can include a subtitle; a second, separate line of text displayed just below the title. It is controlled with the <code>/title</code> and <code>/titleraw</code> commands. {{IN|be}}, the opacity of the black background of the screen title can be adjusted with the "Text Background Opacity" option in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].

=== Scoreboard ===
{{Main|Scoreboard}}
The scoreboard system is a complex gameplay mechanic utilized through [[commands]]. Mainly intended for mapmakers and [[server]] operators, scoreboards are used to track, set, and list the scores of [[entities]] in a myriad of different ways. It is displayed on the right side of the screen.

=== Toasts ===
{{Main|Toasts|Tutorial hints}}
Toasts are text boxes shown when the player unlocks new [[Recipe|crafting recipes]]. Additionally, {{In|je}}, exclusive toasts show when a new music track starts playing, or the player obtains [[Advancement|advancements]]. Most of them show up in the top right corner of the screen, and are displayed in front of effect icons. Music toasts appear in the top left of the screen instead.

Tutorial hints (also known as game tips in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'') are toasts which show up when a player starts a world in [[Survival mode]] for the first time on a device. They are meant to guide new players who may not know the controls. These can be turned off in the [[settings]].{{only|be}}

If multiple recipes are unlocked at once, they all use the same toast. If multiple advancements are unlocked at once, they appear listed one under the other. Up to five toasts can be displayed at once.

{{IN|be}}, the duration of toast messages can be adjusted in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].

== ''Bedrock Edition'' exclusive elements ==
=== Button prompts ===
When using a controller, available actions the player can take are listed on the bottom left and right of the screen, alongside the icon of the button to press to perform that action.

=== Mobile controller ===
{{Main|Controls#Touch}}<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; float: right;">
[[File:Joystick_control_mode.png|thumb|246px|Joystick control mode|class=pixel-image]]
[[File:HUD-BE-Directional buttons.png|thumb|260px|D-Pad control mode|class=pixel-image]]
</div>

These buttons are present only in mobile and desktop versions with a touchscreen, and they are used to control the player. Players can [[sneak]], fly and jump using the mobile controller.

In the settings under {{UI|Controls|Touch}}, players can choose between D-Pad, normal joystick (touch control mode), and joystick with crosshair aim control mode. D-Pad crosshair aim is available separate using "Split Controls" setting.

The position, scale, and opacity of individual buttons and the joystick can be customized in the touch settings.

=== Paper doll ===
The paper doll is a side-view of the player displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. It shows the player's [[skin]] and any [[armor]] worn. If the player is walking, the paper doll shows the player's legs moving. If the player is [[sneaking]], sprint-[[swimming]], [[Emotes|emoting]], or flying with [[elytra]], this can also be seen.

The paper doll can be turned on and off by pressing {{key|F8}} on PC, or in the [[settings]]. This can be done independently from hiding the HUD, although pressing {{key|F1}} also disables the paper doll.

=== Position and Days Played ===
If enabled in the [[world options]], the player's [[coordinates]] and/or days played will be displayed in a box in the top left of the screen. If both are enabled at the same time, the position is listed above the number of days played. Both are shown below the paper doll, and above the chat. The background opacity of this text is affected by the "Text Background Opacity" accessibility setting.

== ''Java Edition'' exclusive elements ==
[[File:AttackIndicatorCrosshair.png|thumb|Attack indicator (below the crosshair), empty and full]][[File:AttackIndicatorHotbar.png|thumb|Attack indicator (next to the hotbar), empty and full]]

=== Attack Indicator ===
{{Main|Melee attack#Attack cooldown}}

The attack indicator represents the attack cooldown timer. It can be displayed next the the crosshair, beside the hotbar, or be hidden completely. This disappears when the cooldown is full. If the [[option]] for the attack indicator is set to "Crosshair" mode, a fully cooled weapon is being held, and a mob or player is in range, the sword icon and an additional plus-sign (+) indicator is shown below the crosshair, indicating that the weapon is in range to land a full-damage blow.

If the option for the attack indicator is set to "Hotbar" mode, the attack cooldown timer is indicated by a sword icon near the crosshair that fills, representing the cooldown progress. This sword icon disappears once the item is fully charged.

In the [[Java Edition Combat Tests|combat tests]], a shield indicator can also be enabled in the same locations.

=== Debug screen ===
{{Main|Debug screen}}
The debug screen (also commonly referred to as the "F3 screen") is triggered when <kbd>F3</kbd> is pressed. It functions as a menu for accessing debugging information, but it also provides useful in-game information like [[Coordinates|player coordinates]].

The debug screen consists of info text lines and five toggleable graphs: profiler, frame rate, [[tick]] rate, bandwidth, and ping time graphs. These graphs can be toggled with specific key combinations.

=== List Players ===
{{Main|Multiplayer#Player list}}
In multiplayer, holding the key bound to List Players (default: {{key|tab}}) will show a list of players at the middle of the top of the screen, including their [[username]], the front face of their [[skin]]'s head, and their signal strength.

== Options ==
In the [[options]] menu, the GUI scale option changes the size of the HUD and GUI. The default setting, "auto", changes the size of the HUD and GUI depending on the size of the game window.{{only|java}}

There is an option to hide the HUD. If the player is using keyboard controls, this can also be done with {{key|F1}}. {{IN|bedrock}}, the "Hide HUD" option toggles the hotbar, crosshair, and if using touch controls, buttons. The hand, paper doll, and coordinates are separate options.

{{IN|be}}, the {{cmd|hud}} command can toggle the visibility of each HUD element.

Players can toggle the HUD, the [[wikipedia:Vignetting|vignette]] effect on fancy graphics, some screen effects and overlays, and the block hitbox by pressing the {{key|F1}} key.

The player can choose whether to use their right or left hand. This option also moves the off-hand slot to the opposite side {{In|je}}, and mirrors the touch controls {{In|be}}.

In ''[[Java Edition]]'', the [[Melee attack#Attack cooldown|attack indicator]] can be set to show by the crosshair, beside the hotbar, or to have it hidden. In the [[Java Edition Combat Tests|combat tests]], a shield indicator can also be enabled in the same locations.

In ''Java Edition'', [[subtitles]] can be enabled in the "Music & Sounds" or "Accessibility Settings" sections of the [[options]] menu.

In ''Java Edition'', [[Toasts|music toasts]] can be disabled in "Music & Sounds".

The [[autosave]] indicator can be toggled in the video settings.

In ''Java Edition'', various settings related to the [[chat]] can be modified in [[options]]. {{IN|be}}, these settings can only be changed in the [[Chat#Chat settings|chat settings]] accessible from the chat menu, except for the opacity and message duration, which can be changed in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].

In ''Bedrock Edition'', the opacity of several HUD elements can be changed in the accessibility settings, as well as toast notification duration.

== ''China Edition'' ==
{{Exclusive|China|section=1}}
[[File:ChinaVersionScreenshot.png|thumb|The HUD in ''[[China Edition]]''.]]
In ''[[China Edition]]'', a "2 button" can be seen at the top of the screen. There is also a button to allow the player to take a screenshot or switch the camera and change voice settings.

At the right of the screen, a button can be seen that is used to lock walking, sprinting or sneaking. It can be useful in some situations.
