The '''Teacher Menu''' was a feature that only existed in {{El|MinecraftEdu}}. It contained many moderation tools and build features to make the teacher's job easier. This feature can only be used by players logged in as a teacher.

== Usage ==
The teacher menu had many uses, the most notable being the [[options]]. They were used to change how the game played with the students and the teacher. To open the menu, while are you in game press the {{Keys|M}} (pre-1.7 ) or {{Key|P}} (post-1.7) key to open the menu. 

These keys can be changed from two places:

*[[Title Screen|Main menu]] -> Options -> [[Controls]]
*In-game -> {{Key|Esc}} or {{Key|Escape}} -> Options -> Controls
To change a key binding, scroll through the list until you find the command you want to change. Click on the box beside the command, then the next key/button you push will be bound to that command.

''Note: Pressing the {{Key|Esc}} or'' ''{{Key|Escape}} will cancel the key binding request.''

Once it is bound, the command line will turn white. If the key/button is already used, the line will turn red.

''Note: A red key binding may result in the key/button activating two [[commands]] or neither command.''

== Options ==
The options of the Teacher Menu is used to manage the world, and for more uses, the most notable is the section [[options]], that serves to change [[gamemodes]], allow [[mobs]], freeze students, teleport, and more.
