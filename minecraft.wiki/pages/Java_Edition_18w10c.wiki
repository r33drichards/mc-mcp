'''18w10c''' is the twenty-sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on March 8, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w10d|March 6, 2018}}</ref>, which added [[waterlogged]] blocks.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Waterlogging]]'''
* New [[water]] physics.
** Water can be placed in [[chest]]s, [[trapped chest]]s, [[stairs]], [[slab]]s, [[fence]]s, [[wall]]s, [[iron bars]], and [[glass pane]]s.
*** Water can flow out these blocks, but cannot flow into them.
*** When full of water, they count as water blocks for all gameplay (such as swimming).
*** Water flows out of all faces of the block.
** Removed the blocks <code>flowing_water</code> and <code>flowing_lava</code>.
** Removed the block tags <code>water_hacked</code> and <code>waterlogged</code>.
** All of the blocks that water can be placed in now have the block state <code>waterlogged</code>.
** Blocks such as bubble column or kelp always count as a water source.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Phantom]]s'''
* Are now considered undead mobs.
** Are now harmed by Healing potions, healed by Harming potions, ignored by the wither, and affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
