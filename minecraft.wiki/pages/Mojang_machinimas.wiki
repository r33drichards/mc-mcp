'''Mojang machinimas''' are short videos, generally trailers for updates, DLCs or events, that consist of footage of ''[[Minecraft]]'' gameplay and are uploaded on official [[Mojang Studios]] social media platforms or websites. They differ from [[Mojang cinematics]] in being filmed inside the game rather than animated with conventional animation software. These machinimas have usually been made either by Mojang employees or by contracted video creators such as [[Hat Films]] or [[Vareide]].
