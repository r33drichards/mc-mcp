The Zombie Horse Cape could be obtained as a reward for the "Spear Mayhem" challenge, which ran from December 12, 2025 at 16:00 UTC to December 15, 2025 at 18:00 UTC. The challenge involved killing 5 [[mob]]s using a [[spear]] in [[Survival]] mode {{in|BE}} during the time period.<ref name="challenge-article">{{mcnet|mounts-of-mayhem-challenges|Mounts of Mayhem challenges|December 12, 2025|Per Landin}}</ref> The five mobs could be killed separately, and any neutral or hostile mob would count. In addition, going from Creative to Survival mode was allowed.<ref>{{tweet|CornerHardMC|1999915336838320331|Some more info:<br>- You just need to defeat five mobs total, not necessarily all at once<br>- Doesn't matter whether the mobs are neutral or hostile<br>- You can go to Creative and back to Survival}}</ref>
