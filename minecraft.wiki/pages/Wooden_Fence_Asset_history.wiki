; Other notes
* From Alpha v1.0.17 to 14w08a, unconnected fence posts would contain two small cuboids, completely interior to the fence block. These could only be seen by clipping inside of the fencepost itself. This did not change the outwards appearance of unconnected fences.
* The following reported issues may change the appearance of fences in future if fixed:
** {{bug|MC-109478}} - Fence model texture doesn't connect correctly
*** Apparently, fixing this bug would not affect '''unconnected''' fences, or fences facing '''south''', '''west''' or '''south-west'''. But only when the camera is facing towards north-west.
** {{bug|MC-267281}} - Fence multipart model system performance optimization
