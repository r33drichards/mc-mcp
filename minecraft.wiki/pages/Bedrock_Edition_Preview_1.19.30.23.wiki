== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Splashes]]'''
* Removed "Your gender is valid!" and "Contains infinite genders!".
** These were later re-added in the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.19.30]], which implies that the removal was a mistake.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Upcoming Creator Features" and  "GameTest Framework" experimental toggle.
=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''Actor Properties'''
* Add a content error when default or set_property expressions include side-effects, such as Molang variable assignment

'''GameTest Framework'''
* Memory Watchdog
** <code>script-watchdog-memory-warning-</code> produces a content log warning when the combined memory usage exceeds the given threshold (in megabytes). Setting this value to 0 disables the warning. (default = 100)
** <code>script-watchdog-memory-limit-</code> saves and shuts down the world when the combined memory usage exceeds the given threshold (in megabytes). Setting this value to 0 disables the limit. (default = 250)
* Player
** setVelocity will now throw an exception when called on player types
* Watchdog
** Increased slow code warning threshold from 2 ms to 6 ms
* Items
** Renamed <code>Items</code> to <code>ItemTypes</code>
* ItemTypes
** Added <code>function getAll(): ItemTypeIterator-</code> Returns an iterator of all available item types
