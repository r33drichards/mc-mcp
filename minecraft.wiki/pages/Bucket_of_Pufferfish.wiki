A '''bucket of pufferfish''', internally known as a '''pufferfish bucket''', is a living [[pufferfish]] inside of a [[water bucket]]. They can also be used to tame and breed [[nautilus]]es.

== Obtaining ==
A bucket of pufferfish can be obtained by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on a [[pufferfish]]. Once a water bucket is used, the pufferfish is picked up along with the water source block.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s occasionally sell a bucket of pufferfish for 3 [[emerald]]s.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Pressing {{control|use}} with a bucket of pufferfish places a [[water]] source block, and spawns the pufferfish back into the world, leaving an [[bucket|empty bucket]] in the [[player]]'s [[inventory]]. Placing a bucket of pufferfish in [[the Nether]] causes the same [[particle]]s to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the pufferfish is spawned alone.

Pufferfish caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.

If a bucket of pufferfish is inside a [[dispenser]], the dispenser spawns the pufferfish and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up a pufferfish when using a water bucket, due to the bucket being emptied instead.

If a bucket of pufferfish is named a certain name through an [[anvil]], the pufferfish inside displays that name as if it were named with a [[name tag]].{{Only|java}} Alternatively, if a named pufferfish is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of pufferfish shares a name with the captured pufferfish.{{Only|java}} If a named pufferfish is captured {{in|Bedrock}}, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".

== Trivia ==
*When a [[water bucket]] is transformed into a bucket of pufferfish, it actually pushes the bucket texture down one pixel. According to [[Dinnerbone]], [[JAPPA]] says this is due to the "weight of the fish".<ref>{{bug|MC-127919|||WAI}}</ref>
