The '''game menu''' (also known as the '''pause menu''') is one of ''Minecraft''{{'}}s multiple [[menu screen]]s. Activated during gameplay, it provides a portal to configure game options, quit out of a world, and more. This menu can be accessed anytime (when not in a [[GUI]]) by pausing the game with the {{Key|Esc}} key.

The game completely freezes when the pause menu is opened in singleplayer. {{IN|be}}, a setting to disable pausing in singleplayer is available, and enabled by default.<ref name="pause preview">{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/34034576387469-Minecraft-1-21-60-Bedrock|title=Minecraft - 1.21.60 (Bedrock)|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=February 11, 2025|Quote=The pause functionality will only be available in Beta and Preview for the time being.}}</ref> The game is not paused in {{edu}}, but singleplayer and multiplayer worlds can be paused when connected to the companion app ''[[Classroom Mode|Classroom Mode For Minecraft]]''.

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
[[File:Pause menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The pause screen {{in|bedrock}}.]]
[[File:Pause menu with screenshot button (Bedrock).png|thumb|The pause screen {{in|bedrock}} with the [[screenshot]] button.]]The pause menu appears as an overlay with a gray section on the left containing the game's [[logo]] and some buttons. A green message shows when the game is paused. On the right side, an animated player doll is shown with the player's [[skin]] and name tag, with a button to open the dressing room and the social drawer.

{{INUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}}, the settings button is moved to the big text buttons, and the "Game is paused" notice shows left from the "Social" button.

|}

=== Social drawer ===
{{main|Social}}
[[File:Ore UI - Pause Menu - "Social" Tab Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The social drawer in the pause menu.]]
Similar to the social drawer in the [[play]] and [[profile]] screen, this shows a list of all online and offline in-game friends. At the top of the list, all players currently in the world are shown. Each player button shows their activity below the gamertag, and can be pressed to open their profile. The button on the right can be used to manage some options for the player. At the top of the social drawer, there are buttons to invite friends to the world or manage [[player permissions]].

{{INUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}}, the social drawer is organized in three tabs. A "Search for people" bar above opens the "Search for players" screen, where new friends can be added. The "World" tab shows exactly the same features as the old social drawer. The "People" tab shows the same features as the social drawer in the game menus (without players currently in the world), and the "Party" tab shows players currently in the party, with some options, or a button to create a party.

== Custom buttons ==
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
It is possible for servers and [[data pack]]s to add a button to the pause menu. In that case, the "Report Bugs" and "Give Feedback" buttons are moved into a sub-screen, accessible by "Feedback..." button.

=== Dialogs ===
[[Dialog]]s can be added to the pause screen by adding them to the {{tag link|dialog|minecraft:pause_screen_additions}} tag. If more than one dialog is added, a "Custom Options..." button is shown that leads to a sub-screen listing all dialogs.

=== Server links ===
{{See also|Java Edition protocol/Packets#Server Links (configuration)}}
[[File:Pause Menu with Server Links.png|thumb|right|The pause screen {{in|je}} in multiplayer with server links.|310px]]
[[File:Server Links.png|thumb|right|The server links screen with built-in and custom links.|310px]]

Server [[operator]]s can provide '''server links''' to their website, forums, bug tracker, feedback site, and more. They are shown using the {{cd|[[Dialog#server_links|minecraft:server_links]]}} dialog. This dialog is automatically added to the {{tag link|dialog|minecraft:pause_screen_additions}} tag when that tag is empty otherwise and the server specifies server links.

Each of the server links is customizable: built-in server links have predefined labels, while custom server links allow custom labels using [[text component format]]. Operators can set custom links for their built-in and custom server links.

There are ten built-in server links that operators can use:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Option
!Description
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Bug Report|20em}}
|Provides the server's bug tracker website, where players can report a server-specific bug. This link will also be displayed on the players' connection error screen, and included as a comment in the disconnection report.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Community Guidelines|20em}}
|Provides the server's community guidelines for players.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Support|20em}}
|Provides the server's help and support page for players.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Status|20em}}
|Provides the server's uptime status for players to check if the server is online, or offline under specific reasons.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Feedback|20em}}
|Provides the server's feedback page for players to post their feedback and participate.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Community|20em}}
|Provides the server's community page for players to interact with the community.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Website|20em}}
|Provides the server's website.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Forums|20em}}
|Provides the server's forums.
|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|News|20em}}

|-
|style="font-size: large; text-align: center;" | {{Btn|Announcements|20em}}
|Provides the server's announcements, where players can read important news or events for the server.
|}

Server links can only be specified through custom server-sent packets to the client. The [[vanilla]] [[server.jar|server software]] does not provide any settings nor utilities for this, and thus cannot be configured without [[modification]]s to the software or third-party utilities. The {{cd|[[server.properties]]}} also provides no settings for server links.
