A '''campfire''' is a block that can be used to cook [[food]], pacify [[bee]]s, or act as a spread-proof [[light source]], a smoke signal, or a damaging trap.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Campfires can be mined with any tool or by hand, but [[axe]]s are the fastest. When mined regularly, a campfire drops 2 [[charcoal]]. If mined with a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], the campfire instead drops itself as an item.

{{IN|BE}}, a campfire can also be broken by pushing it with a [[piston]] or [[sticky piston]]. Pistons cannot move or break campfires {{in|je}}.

{{breaking row|Campfire|axe|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Campfires can generate in [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]]{{only|be}} [[village]]s.

Campfires can generate in camps inside [[ancient cities]], beneath a pile of blue, light blue and cyan [[wool]] blocks.

Campfires can generate in [[trail ruins]].

Note that [[Log|crimson and warped stems]] are valid campfire ingredients even though they are not themselves flammable as items.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Unlike regular [[fire]], a campfire's fire does not spread under any circumstances.

Campfires are lit by default when placed. A campfire can be manually lit by {{control|using}} [[flint and steel]] on it (either by player or by [[dispenser]]), {{control|using}} a [[fire charge]] on it, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is true. {{IN|bedrock}}, campfires can also be lit by {{control|using}} an item enchanted with [[Fire Aspect]], or stepping on it while burning. 

A campfire can be extinguished by [[waterlogging]] it (placing [[water]] in the same block space), throwing a [[splash water bottle]] on it, or {{control|using}} a [[shovel]] on it. Campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face.{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-262205||Campfires can't be extinguished on the bottom face|WAI}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire. As with [[torches]], rain does not extinguish campfires.<ref>{{bug|MC-141920||Rain doesn't put out campfire|Works as Intended}}</ref>

Using [[flint and steel]] on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.

=== Particles and smoke signals ===
[[File:Campfire with smoke.gif|thumb|A campfire emitting smoke]]
Campfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a [[hay bale]] is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead.

Campfire smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks any higher than that.

Although a trapdoor is thinner than a slab, a trapdoor can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up.

Campfires emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to [[lava]].

Campfires also occasionally emit ember particles, similar to lava.

=== Damage ===
If lit, campfires damage [[mob]]s standing on top of them, even if underwater (with exceptions such as [[shulker]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, or [[guardian]]s). Campfires deal {{hp|1}} every tick (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second). Campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Because campfires do not set mobs on fire, mobs that die to them drop raw food instead of cooked food. Damage taken is considered [[fire damage]], so [[armor]] itself does not reduce damage caused by campfire; to do so, the player needs the [[Resistance]] potion effect, or the [[Protection]] or [[Fire Protection]] enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a [[potion of Fire Resistance]] or wearing [[Frost Walker]] boots.

Regardless of [[Solid block#Height|height]], all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above campfires. The campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.

=== Cooking ===
[[File:Campfire (Cooking).gif|thumb|Some food being cooked on a campfire]]
The player can place any of the following food items on a lit campfire by {{control|using}} the food item on it.

*{{ItemLink|Raw Beef}}
*{{ItemLink|Raw Chicken}}
*{{ItemLink|Raw Rabbit}}
*{{ItemLink|Raw Porkchop}}
*{{ItemLink|Raw Mutton}}
*{{ItemLink|Raw Cod}}
*{{ItemLink|Raw Salmon}}
*{{ItemLink|Potato}}
*{{ItemLink|Kelp}}

Up to four food items can be placed on a campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously. Unlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook. On a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked. Food items take 30 seconds (600 [[tick]]s) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for [[furnace]]s or 5 seconds for [[smoker]]s. Assuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, campfires are more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done. It is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off. Once finished cooking, items pop off the campfire. If the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, the remaining cooking time quickly counts back up. Food items can be placed on an unlit campfire. Any items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.

Other items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods, or add-ons.

=== Hoppers ===
Campfires do not have an [[Inventory#External inventories|external inventory]]. Raw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a [[hopper]].

A hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.

=== Bees ===
Placing a campfire under a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]] allows [[honey bottle]]s and [[honeycomb]] to be harvested without provoking the [[bee]]s.

There must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest. [[Copper grate]]s and [[carpet]]s{{only|JE}} are an exception.

=== Light source ===
Standard lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Like most other sources of light, campfires melt nearby [[snow]] and [[ice]].

=== Note blocks ===
Campfires can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

=== Piston interactivity ===
{{IN|BE}}, pushing a campfire with a [[piston]] or [[sticky piston]] breaks it, dropping two [[charcoal]]. Campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.

{{IN|JE}}, pistons do not interact with campfires. Campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.
