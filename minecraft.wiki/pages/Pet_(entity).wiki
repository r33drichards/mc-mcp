A '''pet''' is an interactive [[passive mob]] found in ''[[China Edition]]'' that resembles [[fox]]es.

== Behavior ==
Pets will come to the [[player]] when called upon with the "summon" button, and unlike [[foxes]], which they are made to look like, they will not run from the player (even it falls into the [[void]], it will immediately teleport to the player) and will follow the player around like a tamed animal. It has a total of 27 "backpack" or inventory slots, in which the player can store items. There is an "animations" tab that has 7 buttons: Rest, Hop, Roll Around, Shake, Excitement, Look Around, and Furrify.

The player can interact with their pet by playing with it using the "play button", which will cause it to run away from them to chase a tennis ball and come back to them. The player can command the pet to "stay" like other tamed animals, but the player cannot feed it.

Pets play a random music disc's music{{Info needed}} after clicking the "music button", which is shaped like two connected eighth notes.

The order of the tabs are:

Pet-Outfit - Backpack - Function - Appearance - Action
