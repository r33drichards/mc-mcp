'''19w03a''' is the fourteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on January 16, 2019, which adds [[composter]]s.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-19w03a|title=Minecraft Snapshot 19w03c|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240523175300/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-19w03a|website=[[Minecraft.net]]|author=[[Adrian Östergård]]|date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Composter JE1.png; Composter (level 3) JE1.png; Composter (level 4) JE1.png; Composter (level 5) JE1.png; Composter (level 6) JE1.png; Composter (level 7) JE1.png; Composter (level 8) JE1.png|32px}} [[Composter]]'''
* Produces [[bone meal]].
** {{ctrl|Using}} [[Composter#Compostable list|certain items]] on the composter has a chance to add 1 level of composting to the composter, up to 7 levels. After the composter reaches level 7, it turns into level 8, which is the harvestable stage, yielding 1 [[bone meal]] when used.
** Some composted items are consumed without adding a level. The chance a level is added depends on the quality of the item: larger or crafted items have a higher chance of adding a layer when used (e.g. [[kelp]] has a low chance of about 10%, while [[pumpkin pie]] has a chance of 100%).
* Crafted with 3 [[planks]] and 4 [[fences]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Barrel]]s, [[blast furnace]]s, [[grindstone]]s, [[smoker]]s, and [[sweet berry bush]]es'''
* Added sounds for the blocks or items.

'''[[Crops]] and [[nether wart]]'''
* Added placement sounds.

'''[[Campfire]]s'''
* Changed model and texture.
* Now gives off light level 15.

'''[[Scaffolding]]'''
* Now scaffolding without blocks under it has a bottom that can be walked on.
* Now possible to place scaffolding to the side, similar to how can be stacked upwards.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Giant]]s'''
* No longer use [[zombie]] AI nor [[NBT format|NBT data]].
