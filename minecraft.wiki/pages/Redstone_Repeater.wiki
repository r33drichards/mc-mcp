A '''redstone repeater''' is a [[block]] that produces a full-strength [[redstone]] signal from its front while its back is powered, with four {{Control|use|text=toggleable}} delay settings. It can also be locked into its current power state by directly powering its side with another repeater or a [[redstone comparator]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A redstone repeater can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] using any [[tool]], or without a tool, and drops itself as an item. To remove a redstone repeater, {{control|mine}} it.
{{breaking row|Redstone Repeater|horizontal=1}}
A redstone repeater is removed and drops as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed;
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space;{{only|java}}
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Redstone Repeater naturally generated.png|thumb|A redstone repeater generated in the jungle temple's hidden room.]]
A single redstone repeater is generated naturally in each [[jungle pyramid]].

8-13 redstone repeaters can also generate in [[ancient cities]].

== Usage ==
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}
A redstone repeater can be used in four different ways: to "repeat" redstone signals back to full strength, delay signals, prevent signals moving backward, or to "lock" signals in one state.

A repeater can be placed only on top of [[full blocks]] (dirt, stone, etc.), on top of upside-down [[slab]]s, upside-down [[stairs]], furnaces, and glass. {{IN|be}}, a repeater can also be placed on fences and stone walls. They can also be placed on some transparent blocks. See [[Opacity/Placement]] for more information. To place a repeater, use the {{control|Place Block}} [[control]].

A redstone repeater has a front and back – the arrow on the top points to the repeater's front. A repeater also has two small redstone torches on its top – the color of the torches indicates whether its output is on (dark red when off, bright red when on) and the distance between them indicates the delay the repeater adds to the signal transmission.

A repeater is 0.125 ({{frac|1|8}}) blocks high.

=== Signal transmission ===
A repeater transmits signals only from its back to its front, but its behavior can be modified from the side (see [[#Signal locking|signal locking]], below).

[[File:Redstone Torch Power.png|Different ways to power a repeater|thumb]]
A redstone repeater can be powered by any of the following components at its back:
* an active [[power component]] (redstone torch, lever, block of redstone, etc.)
* powered [[redstone dust]]
* a powered [[redstone comparator]] or another powered redstone repeater facing the repeater
* a powered [[conductive]] block (including any conductive [[mechanism component]]s, such as [[dispenser]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.)

A redstone repeater can power any of the following components at its front:
* redstone dust
* a redstone comparator or another redstone repeater facing away from the repeater
* any [[conductive]] block (including any conductive [[mechanism component]]s)

A redstone repeater can activate any [[mechanism component]] it is facing.

A [[conductive]] block powered by a redstone repeater is called "strongly-powered" (as opposed to a conductive block "weakly-powered" by redstone dust). A strongly-powered conductive block can power adjacent redstone dust, as well as other redstone components.

=== Signal repeating ===
{{see also|Transmission circuit#Repeater}}
A redstone repeater can "repeat" a [[redstone]] signal, boosting it back up to power level 15.

Redstone signals have a maximum power level of 15 and that level drops by 1 for every block of [[redstone dust]] the signal travels through. If a signal must travel through more than 15 [[block]]s of redstone dust, a redstone repeater can be used to boost the signal back up to full strength. An extra two blocks of distance can be achieved by placing [[conductive]] blocks before and after the repeater.

While redstone repeaters can allow signals to travel great distances, each always adds some delay to the transmission since the minimum amount of delay is {{convert|2|game tick|second}}.

=== Signal delay ===
When initially placed, a redstone repeater has a delay of {{convert|2|game tick|second}}.

A repeater's delay can be modified by using the {{control|Use Item}} control. Each use increases the repeater's delay by two ticks, to a maximum of eight, then reverting back to two ticks. Longer delays can be made with multiple repeaters – for example, a repeater set to '8' and another to '2' provides a half-second delay (8 &times; 0.05s + 2 &times; 0.05s = 0.5s).

{| class=wikitable
! Setting !! Delay
|-
| 1st || {{convert|2|game tick|second}}
|-
| 2nd || {{convert|4|game tick|second}}
|-
| 3rd || {{convert|6|game tick|second}}
|-
| 4th || {{convert|8|game tick|second}}
|}

A repeater set to a delay of four to eight ticks increases the length of any shorter [[Pulse circuit#Pulses|on-pulse]] to match the length of the repeater's delay, and suppresses any shorter off-pulse. For example, a repeater set to a 4-tick delay changes a [[zero tick|0-tick]]{{only|java}}, 1-tick, 2-tick, or 3-tick on-pulse into a 4-tick on-pulse, and does not allow through any off-pulse shorter than 4 ticks (except for the caveats below). {{IN|java}}, a repeater set to a delay of two ticks can also extend the length of any 0-tick or 1-tick pulse.

Although a repeater cannot be set to have a delay of zero, {{In|java}}, [[Transmission circuit#Instant repeater|instant repeater circuits]] are possible (circuits that repeat a signal with no delay).

{{IN|java}}, when and whether a repeater turns on or off in reponse to changes in the input signal is affected by [[scheduled tick]]s. Upon receiving a [[Block update#Neighbor changed update|block update]], an unpowered repeater receiving a signal will schedule a tick to turn on. Immediately before turning on, and subsequently whenever it is updated, the repeater will check whether it is still receiving a signal, and if not, it will schedule a tick to turn off. Once the tick runs, the repeater will only turn off if it is still not receiving a signal, and will otherwise stay on at least until the next scheduled tick, if any. However, only one tick can be scheduled at a time, and any attempt to schedule a tick while one already exists is completely ignored. As a consequence, even a very short off-pulse can cause a repeater to turn off, if it happens to occur at the same time as a previously scheduled tick to turn off. A locked repeater completely ignores all block updates and scheduled ticks.

=== {{anchor|diode}} Signal direction ===
{{see also| Mechanics/Redstone/Transmission circuit#Diode}}

A redstone repeater acts as a diode – it allows redstone signals through in one direction (unlike [[redstone dust]] or [[conductive]] blocks that can transmit redstone signals in any direction).

A diode can be used to protect a [[redstone circuit]] from redstone signals feeding back into the circuit from its output, or can be used to isolate one part of a circuit from another.

=== {{anchor|lock}} Signal locking ===
{{see also| Mechanics/Redstone/Memory circuit}}
[[File:Latch.png|thumb|The left repeater has been locked in an unpowered output state by the right repeater.]]
A redstone repeater can be "locked" by another powered redstone repeater facing its side. When locked, the repeater does not change its output (whether powered or unpowered), no matter what the input does. When the side repeater turns back off, the repeater returns to its normal behavior.

A repeater can also be locked by a powered [[redstone comparator]] facing its side. This offers additional possibilities for locking signals because a comparator's output can be affected from 3 sides as well as by containers.

If a repeater is locked again too quickly after unlocking (e.g. the lock is controlled by a fast clock circuit), or the lock and the input are changed only on the same tick (e.g. because they're fed by the same clock and both repeaters have the same delay), the repeater does not switch states.
