A '''sky box''' is an item added in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Obtaining ==
The sky box item can be found in one of the rooms unlocked with a [[shimmering key]], known as the boiler room. 

== Usage ==
A sky box is used to set the look of the [[sky (block)|sky]] in the current [[dimension]]. You can use it in a [[dimension control]] block, which will change the skybox of the world you're currently in. Seven different skyboxes can be accessed by opening a [[shimmering door]] with the boiler room key (accessible with {{cmd|give @s shimmering_key[instant_room{{=}}{"structure": boiler}]}}) which will give you the skyboxes with following skies: 

# "Hub (Classic)", which is a pure bedrock sky, can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={repeats: 16, size:400.0f, texture: "block/bedrock", name: {translate: "sky.classic_hub"}, type: "cube"}]</code>
# "Overworld", which is a normal sky, can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={type: "overworld"}]</code>
# "Missing", which is a sky with the [[missing texture]], can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={repeats: 16, size: 400.0f, texture: "missing", name: {translate: "sky.missing"}, type: "cube"}]</code>
# "The End", which is the [[End sky]], can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={type: "end"}]</code>
# "Smol", which is a sky with a panorama from inside a mine entrance, can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={type: "panorama"}]</code>
# "Bad Idea", which is the entirety of [[blocks.png-atlas]], can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={repeats: 1, size: 400.0f, texture: "atlas/blocks", name: {translate: "sky.atlas"}, type: "cube"}]</code>
# "True Sky", which is a sky with the tiled texture of the block "Sky", can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={repeats: 8, size:400.0f, texture: "block/sky", name: {translate: "sky.actual_sky"}, type: "cube"}]</code>
# There also exists an 8th sky, which you can take out in the overworld dimension, called "Dev Mode", can be given with: <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={type: "code"}]</code>
# You can make a sky out of any texture when you replace "block_name" in this command with the name of any block, you can also change "repeats" to be any integer. <code>/give @s sky_box[sky={repeats: 1, size:400.0f, texture: "block/block_name", name: {translate: "sky.classic_hub"}, type: "cube"}]</code>
