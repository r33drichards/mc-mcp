'''Curse of Binding''' is an [[enchantment]] that prevents the item from being removed from armor slots.

== Obtaining ==
Curse of Binding is a [[treasure enchantment]]; it can be obtained from [[fishing]], [[raid]] drops,{{only|bedrock|short=1}} [[trading]] with a librarian of any level, and in the following structures loot chests: [[desert pyramid]], [[stronghold]], [[ocean ruins]], [[woodland mansion]], [[pillager outpost]], [[ancient city]], [[mineshaft]], [[monster room]], [[jungle pyramid]]s, and from vaults in [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
An item with Curse of Binding cannot be removed from any armor slot unless the player is in [[Creative]] mode, the player dies, or the item breaks. For items without durability or the [[elytra]], the player must die to remove the item, making removal in [[Hardcore]] mode impossible.

All mobs also follow the Curse of Binding; for example, if wearing a leather helmet enchanted with Curse of Binding, they cannot take it off to equip their preferred netherite helmet if they find one. A player cannot remove the enchantment using a [[grindstone]] or crafting table; instead, the item returns to the player is still cursed. However, if the cursed item is a carved pumpkin or mob head, placing and breaking the block removes the curse.

If the <code>keepInventory</code> [[gamerule]] is set to <code>true</code>, the player keeps the cursed item even after death. In this situation, only breaking the item, if possible, removes it.

However, the execution of the commands {{cmd|item}}{{only|JE}} or {{cmd|replaceitem}}{{only|BE}} is compulsory. Therefore, they can still remove items with Curse of Binding by replacing them.

This enchantment does not prevent removal of the affected item from one's inventory unless it is equipped.
