[[File:Overworld 1.18.png|thumb|320px|A [[forest]] and a [[Mountains|mountain range]] as seen in the Overworld.]]
The '''Overworld''' is the first and primary [[dimension]] in which all players begin their ''Minecraft'' world. It is the dimension with the most [[biome]]s, [[block]]s, and [[mob]]s, and is where most players spend the majority of their time.

== Creation ==
{{main|World generation}}

The Overworld is the only dimension created when the player creates a new world. The other dimensions ([[The Nether]] and [[The End]]) aren't created until a player enters the corresponding dimension for the first time, usually using a [[nether portal]] or [[end portal]])

=== Seeds ===
{{Main|World seed}}

A new world in ''Minecraft'' is generated through the use of a randomly generated seed, which is an integer used as a starting point for the world generation formula. The player can specify a seed or allow the game to generate one randomly. If given a non-integer input (such as the word "Glacier"), the game converts it into a corresponding integer (such as 1772835215).

A given seed generates exactly the same world every time, as the algorithem for world generation only uses the seed, provided the same [[edition]], [[Version history|game version]], and [[world type]] are used. Although the exact [[spawn point]] can vary, the [[coordinates]] of all terrain features are the same. All seeds within the 32-bit integer limit {{in|je|be}} may also generate worlds with the same terrain shape and biome map, but the placement of terrain features, structures, and carver caves may vary.

== Environment ==
The Overworld is an incredibly complex environment with a wide variety of features, more so than any other dimensions.

=== Biomes ===
[[File:River through Mesa.png|thumb|right|A river biome running through the [[badlands]] biome. A ruined portal can also be seen in the distance.]]
{{Main|Biome}}

The Overworld is divided into 54 [[biome]]s of various types. A biome's type determines the basic characteristics of the terrain within it, such as the blocks composing the surface or the plants that thrive in it. The biome type also determines which [[mobs]] can spawn within it and affects how environmental behaviors such as [[weather]] are expressed within it.

=== Natural structures ===
[[File:Village-1.14-overworld.png|alt=|thumb|right|A [[village]], one of many naturally generated structures in the Overworld.]]
{{Main|Generated structures}}

The Overworld is composed of 17 terrain patterns, called [[generated structures]], whose arrangement varies widely from one seed to another. The exact structures are unique to each world, while the types of structures that can be generated at a given place are determined by the biome type. Structures are meant to represent real-world equivalents such as [[mountain]]s, [[cave]]s, and [[lake]]s. "Impossible" (in the real world) formations, such as [[floating island]]s, can also be found throughout the Overworld.

Along with terrain features, natural structures include naturally-generated buildings, such as [[village]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, and [[ruined portal]]s.

=== Daylight cycle ===
[[File:Day Night.gif|thumb|right|A view of the day-night cycle.]]
{{Main|Daylight cycle}}

The Overworld is the only dimension with a daylight cycle and the only one where the environment reflects the passage of time. In contrast to time zones in the real world, Overworld time is universal; it is always the same time for every player in the dimension regardless of how far apart they might be, even in an "infinite" world.

During the daytime, the [[sun]] acts as a powerful [[light]] source, with a light level of 15, the maximum. [[Sunlight]] is strong enough to grow plants and affect the way [[mobs]] spawn, among other interesting effects. During the nighttime, the [[moon]] is the only natural [[light]] source. However, moonlight is comparatively dim; the light level falls to a minimum of 4, allowing hostile mobs to spawn. Other than during [[thunderstorm]]s, night time is the only time players may sleep in a [[bed]], which will explode when used in [[The Nether|the nether]] or [[The End|the end]].

The daylight cycle can effectively be measured using a [[clock]], which allows players to determine the approximate [[Daylight cycle#Conversions|Minecraft time]] anywhere in the Overworld. Time can also be changed or stopped with the use of the {{cmd|time}} command.

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, just as it does in the real world, though the sun will always be directly overhead at noon. Observing its motion is a simple method of telling direction without a [[compass]].

=== Mobs ===
{{Main|Mob}}

The Overworld is home to the vast majority of ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s [[mobs]]. Mobs vary greatly in behavior and the level of danger they present to the player. Different mobs spawn at different times and places depending on the light level and the biome, among many other factors. On occasion, a mob can move between the Overworld and another dimension, such as [[The Nether]], by using a [[portal]], but this is uncommon. Boss mobs like the [[ender dragon]] and the [[wither]] cannot enter portals.

== Generation ==
As with all other dimensions in the game, the Overworld can generate infinitely. However, there are some limitations, [[#Limitations|as detailed below]]. Like the other dimensions, it is divided into 16×384×16 block sections called [[chunks]].

The Overworld encompasses a three-dimensional volume that extends vertically from the [[Void]] up to the [[Altitude|build limit]] (y=-64 to 320), and horizontally for a virtually infinite distance in each direction. This volume is filled (virtually speaking) with air, terrain, and structures. Technically, the terrain is formed by generating multiple noise maps to produce differing elevations, general land shapes, and complex mountain and cave systems.

=== Limitations ===
[[File:mc cutoff.png|thumb|left|Visual cutoff point of an old ''Minecraft'' map (Left is normal ''Minecraft'' generation, the right is after limitation.)]]
{{Main|World boundary}}

While the world is virtually infinite, the number of blocks a player may physically reach is limited with where the limits are depending on the edition of the game and the world type being played.

{{IN|je}}, the map contains a [[world border]] located by default at X/Z coordinates ±29,999,984. The world border is an animated wall of blue stripes. Standing near the border results in a red vignette appearing around the screen. Most entities are unable to pass the border, except by [[Commands/tp|teleporting]]. Players who breach the border receive constant damage unless they are in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode. The player can teleport past the world border and continue as far as X/Z ±29,999,999, where there is an invisible wall. However, the player can travel a few chunks further by riding horses, pigs, minecarts and boats through it.

In {{el|be}}, worlds have no fixed horizontal limits, but either generation stops or normal game behavior begins to break down at extreme distances; the exact details depend on the platform. However, experiments suggest that players can generally reach at least X/Z ±30,000,000 before many such problems occur, as detailed [[Bedrock Edition distance effects|here]].

== Technical information ==
=== ID ===
{{ID table
| edition = java
| shownumericids = y
| displayname =Overworld
| spritetype = env
| nameid = overworld
| id = 0
| foot = 1
}}

=== Folder ===
{{IN|je}}, information on the Overworld is stored in the <code>region</code> folder of the <code>[[.minecraft]]/saves/worldname</code> directory, with "worldname" being the name of the player's world.

Deleting the <code>region</code> folder resets the Overworld so that all player-made changes and buildings in that dimension are undone.

== Achievements ==
{{Main|Achievements}}
Some achievements and advancements are obtained only in the Overworld, as their conditions cannot be replicated in the [[Nether]] or the [[End]] at all.

== Trivia ==
* The maximum number of blocks that can be generated in the Overworld is approximately 921.6 quadrillion (9.216×10<sup>17</sup>) blocks, assuming a distance of 30,000,000 blocks in either direction.
** The total area is about 8 times the surface of the Earth.
** This means that storing a filled world, with no [[entities]] or [[block entities]], would require 3.6864 quintillion (3.6864×10<sup>18</sup>) bits ({{tooltip|409|409.27261579781770706}} petabytes) for the block data alone, based on the fact that each standard block is assigned 4 bits of information.
** By manually modifying the game, it is possible to generate the world up to 2,147,483,647 blocks (the 32-bit integer limit) in either direction.
* A 1:1 (1 block = 1 meter) scale map of the Earth, built-in ''Minecraft'', would be 510.9 trillion (5.109×10<sup>14</sup>) blocks in size.
** Assuming the map is one block deep and uses 1 byte per block, its size would be approximately 475,800 GB (464.7 TB).
** A Moon-sized map would be made of 37.95 trillion (3.795×10<sup>13</sup>) blocks. Its data size would be 35,340 GB (34.52 TB).
