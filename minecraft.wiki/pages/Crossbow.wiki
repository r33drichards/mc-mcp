A '''crossbow''' is a [[Ranged attack|ranged]] [[weapon]] that can load and fire [[Arrow|arrows]], arrow variants and [[Firework Rocket|firework rockets]]. Holding {{Control|use|text=use}} will load it and it will remain loaded until it is {{Control|use|text=fired}}, after which it can be loaded again.

=== Mob loot ===
==== Pillagers ====
When killed, a [[pillager]] has a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a loaded or unloaded crossbow with random [[durability]]; the [[Drops|drop]] rate increases by 1% per [[Experience|level]] of [[Looting]]: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. The dropped crossbow can rarely (10% chance) be [[Enchanting|enchant]]ed at level 5&ndash;19 regardless of being enchanted when it [[Mob spawning|spawned]].

==== Piglins ====
[[Piglin]]s have a chance of wielding a crossbow upon spawning, and they also have a small chance (8.5%) of dropping a loaded or unloaded crossbow of random durability when killed; this rate increases by 1% per level of [[Looting]]: 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III. It can rarely (10% chance) be enchanted at level 5&ndash;19 regardless of being enchanted when spawned.

== Usage ==
[[File:Crossbow shooting.gif|thumb|right|Shooting a crossbow {{in|java}}.]]

Crossbows are similar to [[bow]]s, but can be charged in advance for use at any time. They take longer to charge than a bow, are slightly more powerful, and shoot farther with slightly higher accuracy. 

Crossbows can be loaded with arrows of any type. Like the bow, arrows shot by crossbows can be blocked by [[shield]]s. A crossbow enchanted with [[Piercing]] fires arrows that ignore blocking shields, allowing them to pass through and still hit their target. Arrows shot from a crossbow enchanted with [[Piercing]] can be picked up and used again, creating an effect similar to the bow-exclusive [[Infinity]] enchantment. When an arrow hits another player, the player that fired the arrow will hear a high-pitched "ding" sound to indicate the successful shot.{{only|je}}

Alternatively, they can be loaded with a firework rocket, which flies in a straight line at 32 m/s and, in {{JE}}, explodes on contact with blocks and entities.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-52675||Fireworks do not explode on impact with entity and blocks}}</ref> If the firework rocket has no firework stars, it deals no [[damage]]. In order to use a firework rocket with a crossbow, at least one firework rocket must be present in the player's [[offhand]]. Using a firework rocket uses 3 [[durability]] per shot, and fireworks with higher flight duration travel farther when fired. When a crossbow has the [[Multishot]] enchantment, the increased durability usage stacks, resulting in 9 durability being consumed with each shot. [[Piercing]] does not work with firework rockets, and firework rocket explosions have a radius of roughly 4 blocks.

A crossbow can first be loaded by {{control|using}} it, which starts charging it. While charging the crossbow, the [[player]] moves at sneaking speed. When the crossbow finishes charging, the arrow or firework rocket is then loaded into it and the player’s speed returns to normal. At this point, the crossbow ''must be used a second time'' to fire its projectile. Shooting a loaded crossbow does not delay any of the player's current actions like [[sprinting]] or [[swimming]]. Both arrows and firework rockets launched by crossbows are not augmented by the [[Strength]] effect.

A loaded crossbow keeps its projectile when placed in another [[inventory]] slot or into an [[item frame]] without the projectile being unloaded or fired. A loaded crossbow also remains charged after repairing or enchanting it using a grindstone, anvil, or enchanting table. {{IN|je}}, the crossbow’s tooltip also lists the loaded projectile and its effect, if any. Like with bows, the player can choose the type of arrow to fire based on its location in their [[inventory]]:
* Arrows in the off-hand, or the selected [[hotbar]] slot if the crossbow is in the off-hand, are prioritized first. 
* If there are no arrows in the off-hand or selected hotbar slot, the arrow closest to slot 0 is selected.

A select few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. However, by use of the explosion from an indirect firework rocket, arrow-immune mobs can be damaged.  The list of arrow-immune mobs include:
* [[Endermen]] - even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows;
* [[Breeze]];
* [[Wither]] under half health, when it gains wither armor;
* Closed [[shulker]]s;
* [[Ender dragon]], while sitting on top of the [[exit portal]].

A crossbow can be combined with another crossbow in an [[anvil]], preserving the [[Enchanting|enchantment]]s of both and the projectile of the ''target'' item.

=== Enchantments ===
A crossbow can receive the following enchantments:

A crossbow cannot be enchanted with Power, Punch, Flame, or Infinity in Survival mode. However, they can be applied via [[anvil]] in Creative mode {{in|java}} or by using commands. When applied, each enchantment functions the same for the crossbow as it would for a [[bow]].
{{Notelist}}

=== Fuel ===
Crossbows can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, [[smelting]] 1.5 [[item]]s per crossbow.

Despite using [[iron ingot]]s in their crafting recipe, crossbows cannot be smelted into [[iron nugget]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-111738}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Alongside [[pillager]]s, crossbows were inspired by ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', even though they were added in the base game first.<ref>{{cite Discord|url=https://discord.com/channels/579770991056519194/818903542139453480/819631528593588244| title = March 2021 developper Q&A|date=March 11, 2021}}</ref>
* Crossbows [[Enchanting|enchant]]ed with [[Quick Charge]] VI and above get stuck on the first frame on the recharging animation because the resulting charge time is negative, and the game never reaches the time markers that tell it to advance the animation or the reloading procedure itself. It is technically possible to charge such crossbows, but this would require overflowing the value that determines how long the crossbow has been charged. This takes such an amount of time that this is practically impossible: for example, charging a crossbow with Quick Charge VI would take 69.4 years to complete.
* Although Piercing allows arrows to bypass [[shield]]s, they cannot get through the [[wither]]'s projectile armor or a [[shulker]]'s shell.
* The crossbow's first-person loading animation {{in|Bedrock}} is different from {{JE}}.
* In real life, [[wikipedia:Crossbow|crossbow]]s do not shoot the same arrows as bows, rather they shoot shorter, thicker, and oftentimes fletchless arrows (usually called "bolts") made to withstand the crossbow's increased power, which can shatter conventional arrows.
