A poisonous potato headpiece can be mined using any item and drops itself when broken.

When a poisonous potato headpiece is pushed by a [[piston]], it breaks off as an [[item (entity)|item]].

{{Drop sources|name=Poisonous Potato Headpiece}}

A poisonous potato headpiece does ''not'' drop when a poisonous potato zombie is killed by a charged creeper's explosion; instead, a normal [[zombie head]] is dropped.

== Usage ==
Player can wear poisonous potato headpieces in the head armor slot, like a [[helmet]]. Poisonous potato zombies are neutral toward players that wear this item: they don't attack first, but they do retaliate if attacked.
