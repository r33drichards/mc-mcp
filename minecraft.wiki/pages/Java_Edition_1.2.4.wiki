== Additions ==
{{Additions table
|Birch Planks
|Spruce Planks
|Jungle Planks
|Cut Sandstone
|Chiseled Sandstone
}}
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Birch Planks JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[Birch wood planks]]'''
'''[[File:Spruce Planks JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[Spruce wood planks]]'''
'''[[File:Jungle Planks JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[Jungle wood planks]]'''
* All planks currently have the same tooltip: "Wooden Planks".

'''[[File:Cut Sandstone JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[File:Chiseled Sandstone JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[Sandstone]] variants'''
* Uses a modified version of the unused sandstone texture from [[Java Edition 1.2.1|1.2.1]].
* Has the same name as the normal sandstone.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Glass JE3 BE1.png|36px]] [[Glass]]'''
* Now drops itself when broken using a tool with [[Silk Touch]].

'''[[File:Sandstone JE2 BE2.png|36px]] [[Sandstone]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Sandstone JE1 BE1.png|36px]].

'''{{Animate|Light Gray Wool JE1 BE1.png;Gray Wool JE1 BE1.png;Black Wool JE1 BE1.png;Brown Wool JE1 BE1.png;Red Wool JE1 BE1.png;Orange Wool JE1 BE1.png;Yellow Wool JE1 BE1.png;Lime Wool JE1 BE1.png;Green Wool JE1 BE1.png;Cyan Wool JE1 BE1.png;Light Blue Wool JE1 BE1.png;Blue Wool JE1 BE1.png;Purple Wool JE1 BE1.png;Magenta Wool JE1 BE1.png;Pink Wool JE1 BE1.png;|36px}} [[Wool]]'''
* Slightly desaturated every color, changing from [[File:Beta color spectrum.png|128px]] to [[File:1.2.4 color spectrum.png|128px]].

=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Tuxedo_Cat_JE1_BE1.png;Red_Cat_JE1_BE1.png;Siamese_Cat_JE1_BE1.png|64px}} [[Cat]]s'''
* When in a standing position, cats now purposely go and sit on nearby [[chest]]s, active [[furnace]]s, and [[bed]]s.
** This prevents players from using them.

[[File:Baby Saddled Pig JE1 BE1.png|40px]] '''[[Pig]]s'''
* Saddles can no longer be put on baby pigs. Saddled baby pigs from previous versions can update to this version and still be ridden.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Added chat history and improved chat editing.
** Links are now clickable in chat.
*** When clicked, a warning screen appears that asks players if they want to continue.
** Players can copy and paste links in chat.
** The mouse wheel can be used to scroll up/down for history.
*** {{key|PAGEUP}} and {{key|PAGEDOWN}} keys can also be used
** Up/down keys scroll through recently sent messages.
* When typing a player's name, pressing {{key|Tab}} automatically fills in the rest of the username.
** Text can now be copied and pasted.
** Similar to how the [[formatting code]] {{key|§k}} displays random characters in chat, {{key|§l}}, {{key|§m}}, {{key|§n}} and {{key|§o}} creates bold, striked, underlined and italic text respectively, while {{key|§r}} resets any set states
*** These cannot be typed using vanilla clients
** Pressing {{key|/}} acts as a [[command]] key: it opens the chat with a {{cd|/}} in place.
** Pressing {{key|left}} or {{key|right}} moves the insertion point (text pointer) in the respective direction, allowing text to be modified.

'''Out of Memory screen'''
* Added "Back" and "Quit" buttons

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Added a "minimal" debug menu
** The same as the regular {{key|F3}} menu, except without the graph/profiler.
** Accessible by {{key|Shift+F3}}.

'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Re-added armor outlines in the armor slots in the inventory.
* Text color lightened to {{color|#565656}}.

== Fixes ==
