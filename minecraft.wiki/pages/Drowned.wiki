'''Drowned''' are common [[neutral mob|neutral]] underwater [[zombie]] variants that spawn in [[ocean]]s, [[river]]s, and [[dripstone caves]], or when zombies drown. They usually attack through melee attacks, but may also come armed with [[trident]]s that they can throw at range.

== Spawning ==
=== Natural generation ===
Drowned spawn naturally at water blocks that emit light level of 0 and [[internal sky light]] level being 7 and below in all [[ocean]] biomes, aquifers in the [[dripstone caves]] biome, and [[river]] biomes. They spawn at higher rates in rivers and dripstone caves than in ocean biomes.

{{IN|Java}}, drowned spawn individually inside flowing water or source water that is 2 blocks or taller (this can include waterlogged blocks or bubble columns). In ocean biomes and dripstone caves, drowned spawn at Y < 58; this restriction does not apply to rivers meaning they can also spawn during the day in that biome as long as it is deep enough for the sky light level to reach 7 and below. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, drowned spawn in groups of 2-4 in [[ocean]]s, [[frozen river]]s, and [[dripstone caves]] while they spawn individually in [[river]]s inside flowing water or source water of any depth, but they spawn at higher rates in water that is 2 blocks or taller.{{info needed|Do they spawn inside waterlogged blocks?}} They spawn only on the surface that is on the highest spawnable block at any given X, Z coordinate. They count toward the monster population control cap and also have their own density caps of 5 in oceans and 2 in rivers. They can spawn during the day as long as the water is deep enough for the sky light level to reach 7 and below. <!-- A 2.5% chance must succeed for oceans, while a 6.(6)% chance must succeed for rivers; this is probably to account for the smaller area rivers occupy. -->

Drowned have a chance to spawn with either a [[trident]] or a [[fishing rod]] in their main hand, and occasionally with a [[nautilus shell]] in their offhand. {{IN|Java}}, when spawned as a baby drowned they also have a small chance to spawn riding a [[chicken]], creating a drowned [[chicken jockey]]. They are the only Overworld zombie variant within the game that cannot spawn naturally with any [[armor]]. 

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Ocean ruins ===
Drowned spawn during the generation of certain [[ocean ruin]] structures. These drowned do not naturally despawn unless the world is set to Peaceful difficulty.

When spawning mounted on a zombie nautilus, the zombie nautilus is also persistent (does not despawn).

=== Conversion ===
[[File:Zombie becoming Drowned.gif|thumb|A [[zombie]] converting into a drowned.|alt=A zombie from Minecraft converting into a drowned, a zombie variant.]]

If a [[zombie]]'s head (not the legs) is submerged in water continuously for 30 seconds, it begins the process of converting to a drowned. The zombie begins shaking, similar to the effect seen while a [[zombie villager]] is being cured. At this point, the process cannot be stopped, and 15 seconds later the zombie becomes drowned. The drowned appears with full health even if the previous zombie did not.

{{IN|bedrock}} only, an item being held or worn by a zombie when it transforms into drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally equipped, is automatically dropped with an 100% drop rate. {{IN|java}}, the converted drowned keeps the equipped items.

Only normal zombies can transform into drowned, while [[zombie villager]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s cannot. For [[husk]]s, they first transform into a regular zombie, and subsequently convert to a drowned in the usual fashion. The zombie that is converted from a husk always has full health even if converted from a damaged husk.

=== Zombie nautilus jockeys ===
When an adult drowned spawns outside of ([[frozen river|frozen]]) [[river]] biomes, either [[spawn cycle|naturally]] or as part of a structure, and is wielding a trident in its main hand, it has a 50% chance to spawn riding a [[zombie nautilus]], i.e. as a [[zombie nautilus jockey]].

=== Reinforcements ===
{{main|Zombie#Reinforcements 2|title1=Zombie § Reinforcements}}{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
On Hard [[difficulty]], all drowned have a 0-10% chance to spawn other drowned as reinforcements when receiving [[damage]] while targeting an [[entity]]. Additionally, up to 5% of drowned spawn as leaders, getting a 50-75% boost to that chance. Reinforcements can only spawn in at least 2 block tall water.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Rotten Flesh|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Copper Ingot|notes=player_or_pet|dropchance=0.11|lootingchance=0.02}}
}}

Adult drowned drop {{xp|5}} and an additional {{xp|1|3}} per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player, axolotl or tamed wolf. Baby drowned drop {{xp|12}} and an additional {{xp|1|3}} per naturally-spawned equipment if killed by a player, [[axolotl]] or tamed [[wolf]].

* 1 {{ItemLink|Helmet}}, {{ItemLink|Chestplate}}, {{ItemLink|Leggings}}, and/or {{ItemLink|Boots}}.{{only|BE}}

Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping, and drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it.

=== Equipment ===
'''''Java Edition'''''

For naturally-spawned drowned:
* In the main hand (mutually exclusive):
** Each drowned has a 6.25% chance to spawn with a {{ItemLink|trident}} {{upcoming|BE 26.0}}. May be enchanted.{{info needed|What is the probability of being enchanted and the average level of enchantment?}}
** Each drowned has a 3.75% chance to spawn with a {{ItemLink|fishing rod}} {{upcoming|BE 26.0}}. May be enchanted.{{info needed|What is the probability of being enchanted and the average level of enchantment?}}
* In the offhand:
** Each drowned has a 3% chance to spawn with a {{ItemLink|nautilus shell}}.

A drowned holding a trident has an 8.5% chance to drop it when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. The chance is increased by 1% per level of [[Looting]], up to a max of 11.5% with Looting III. This means that killing 8 drowned with tridents without the Looting enchantment or 6 with Looting III, will have a greater than 50% chance of getting a trident.

A drowned holding a nautilus shell always drops it.

Zombies converted to drowned are never equipped with new items. They keep any equipment the zombie had before conversion.

On Halloween, a drowned may spawn wearing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]]. However, they do not drop them, even when killed with Looting.

'''''Bedrock Edition'''''

For naturally-spawned drowned:
* In the main hand (mutually exclusive):
** Each drowned has a 15% chance to spawn with a {{ItemLink|trident}}. May be enchanted.{{info needed|What is the probability of being enchanted and the average level of enchantment?}}
** Each drowned has a 0.85% chance to spawn with a {{ItemLink|fishing rod}}. May be enchanted.{{info needed|What is the probability of being enchanted and the average level of enchantment?}}
* In the offhand:
** Each drowned has an 8% chance to spawn with a {{ItemLink|nautilus shell}}.

A drowned holding a trident has a 25% chance to drop it when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, up to a max of 28% with Looting III. This means that killing 3 drowned with tridents without the Looting enchantment or 2 with Looting III, will have a greater than 50% chance of getting a trident.

For converted drowned:
* 1% spawn with a {{ItemLink|fishing rod}} in the main hand.
* 8% spawn with a {{ItemLink|nautilus shell}} in the offhand (same as naturally-spawned drowned).

Zombies converted to drowned are never equipped with tridents. Any equipment the zombie had before conversion is dropped.

=== Farming ===
{{main|Tutorial:Drowned farming}}

Farms that convert [[zombie]]s into drowned produce all of naturally-spawned equipment dropped by [[zombie]]s, as well as [[fishing rod]]s, [[copper ingot]]s, and (in ''Bedrock Edition'') [[nautilus shell]]s.

A drowned farm must be designed to harvest naturally-spawned drowned to produce [[trident]]s in all game editions and [[nautilus shell]]s in ''Java Edition''.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Swimming Drowned.png|150px|thumb|A drowned swimming {{in|java}}.]]

During the day, drowned stay on the floor of the body of water they are in, unless provoked.

If on land during the daytime, drowned seek out nearby water or shade. They sometimes step onto land but quickly return to the water.

Drowned seek out [[turtle egg]]s within 10 blocks {{in|bedrock}} and 24 blocks {{in|java}}. They stomp on turtle eggs until the eggs break. Drowned can even jump over a 1-block gap to reach a turtle egg successfully, even if the egg is raised 1 block higher than the gap. 

Drowned are passive{{only|java|short=1}} or neutral{{only|bedrock|short=1}} during the day if no player in range is touching the [[water]].

They are immune to [[guardian]]s or [[elder guardian]]s attacks. They also have a small chance to be immune to knockback when damaged.<ref>{{bug|MC-68605}}</ref>

Drowned can be damaged by a fully-powered [[conduit]] within a distance of 8 blocks.

{{IN|bedrock}}, drowned can mount and ride any untamed [[zombie nautilus]] that they collide with, but they do not actively search for zombie nautiluses to mount.

Like [[spider]]s and [[endermen]], drowned have eyes (in addition to their noses and mouths) that appear to glow in ''Bedrock Edition'', although they do not produce light. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], all bright parts in the first layer are emissive and glow in the dark.

{{IN|Java}}, drowned are never spawned as part of a [[zombie siege]], but if a drowned naturally spawns nearby, it will join the siege and behave like all other zombies.

=== Attacking ===
==== Generic ====
{{main|Zombie#Attacking}}
They are always hostile toward [[axolotl]]s. Like other zombie variants, they chase and attack [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, [[snow golem]]s,{{only|bedrock|short=1}} baby [[turtle]]s, and [[iron golem]]s, but only at night or in dark areas.

If a drowned kills a [[villager]], either with a melee attack or with a trident, the villager has a chance of turning into a [[zombie villager]] (a 0% chance on Easy [[difficulty]], a 50% chance on Normal, and a 100% chance on Hard).

==== Drowned-specific ====
During the day, drowned ignore [[player]]s on land and in [[boat]]s, only attacking if the player enters the water.

{{IN|java}}, a drowned is also neutral if it is equipped with a [[trident]] during the daytime, only attacking the player if provoked. During the night or in [[thunderstorm]]s, they become hostile and attack any [[player]] or baby turtle they see, without provocation.

Every drowned has a melee attack, and if it spawns with a [[trident]], the trident is used as a ranged [[weapon]]. A drowned with a trident can throw it every 1.5 seconds, sending it up to 20 blocks away. Thrown tridents cannot be picked up by the player, just like [[arrows]] shot by [[skeleton]]s. {{IN|bedrock}}, a drowned with a trident also uses a melee attack if their target is within a 3 blocks [[distance]]. 

A drowned's trident can be [[enchanted]]. The [[Loyalty]], [[Impaling]], and [[Channeling]] enchantments work the same as they would for a player, while [[Riptide]] has no effect for drowned.

A drowned equipped with a trident continues throwing it at the player even after the player leaves the water, or gets a long distance away.<ref>{{bug|MC-187536||Drowned with tridents try to throw tridents at players from an infinite distance}}</ref> It also attacks any player that attacks it or another drowned. However, it is not provoked by a player killing another drowned in one hit.{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-2432|||WAI}}</ref>

If one drowned is hit by another drowned's thrown trident, the attacked drowned ignores it. {{only|java|short=1}}

Sometimes,{{info needed|When and why?}} drowned do not immediately become aggressive toward a player when the player first enters the water.  However these are not "passive" drowned, but slow or non-movers which more-often will melee attack when the player draws closely.

=== Breaking doors ===
Up to 10% of drowned (depending on [[regional difficulty]] {{in|java}}) spawn with the ability to break [[Wooden Door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s on [[Hard]] difficulty.

=== Picking up items ===
Some drowned spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. That includes armor and weapons or tools just like regular zombies. Unlike zombies however, they can also pick up tridents, which they always prefer over anything else.

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* Threatening to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

=== Swimming ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{more images|section=1|Render showing the boat-riding pose}}
[[File:Swimming Drowned BE2.png|thumb|A drowned swimming {{in|bedrock}}.]]

Drowned use a swimming animation similar to the [[player]]. They use this animation whenever they try to pathfind to a player that is either below or above them; if the player is on the same ground level, the drowned simply walk toward them. Drowned also use this animation if they are tracking a player while they are not standing on a solid block. Their hitbox does not change when using this animation.

If they hold a nautilus shell or anything else in their offhand, their arms are in the same posture as a player's. When attacking, they use the player's attacking animation. Still, they use the same swimming animation when tracking a player underwater.

Drowned have a unique [[boat]]-riding pose. When a drowned enters a boat, it does not sit like other mobs. Instead, it switches to a special pose where its upper body is angled forward and raised, giving the appearance that it is climbing up from the water onto the back or side of the boat. This pose is distinct from both the standard riding pose used by other mobs.
{{-}}

=== Mounting ===
{{In development|be|3=26.0|section=1}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, 15% of naturally spawned baby drowned can start riding a mob and become a [[jockey]] when it tries attacking. A jockey mob ridden by a baby drowned will adapt to the speed of its rider. A baby drowned can ride:{{columns-list|* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s

* Drowned are not considered as aquatic mobs, instead, they are considered as undead and are therefore unaffected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment.{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-128249|||WAI}}</ref>
* A drowned [[chicken jockey]] that spawns underwater floats to the surface because the chicken it is riding floats, causing the drowned riding it to burn in sunlight during the day, resulting in a [[chicken]] in the middle of the ocean or river where the drowned chicken jockey spawned in.{{only|java}}
* {{IN|bedrock}}, drowned have a more inflated outer layers. This causes their heads and arms to look larger than {{in|java}} and causes helmets to go inside their heads and their clothing goes off the sides of their leggings.
* The sounds for drowned were recorded by [[Samuel Åberg]] gurgling milk.<ref>{{YouTube link|FnmvKDxVQjM|2=Zombie + Milk = Drowned?|3=Minecraft|4=September 21, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|f0k7JNFGhms|Growth & Evolution - Part 3: 15 Years of Minecraft|Minecraft|June 5, 2024|t=485s}}</ref>
