== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Hostile mobs no longer spawn in bright areas.
* Fixed lag spikes happening randomly due to high chunk updates.

== Bugs ==
'''2 bugs reported'''
* While breaking multiple blocks, it is possible to open the inventory. Upon closing it, the player's hand or tool will remain stuck and will not animate until the breaking stops.
* When breaking a heap of gravel stacked on top of another from the bottom gravel block, part of the top gravel's texture might get stuck, causing a visual glitch.{{Info needed}} 
** The glitch is stopped when a block is placed on the bugged gravel.
** The player can look under the world through the glitched gravel block.
** It seems that only the third gravel block (from the bottom) on a gravel stack is affected by this bug.
