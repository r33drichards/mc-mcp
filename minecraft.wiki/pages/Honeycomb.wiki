'''Honeycombs''' are items obtained by [[Shears|shear]]ing full [[bee nest]]s and [[beehive]]s. They are used to [[Crafting|craft]] beehives, [[candle]]s and [[honeycomb block]]s, and can be applied as [[Oxidation|wax]] to many [[copper]] blocks to prevent them from oxidizing over time, as well as to [[sign]]s to prevent them from being edited.

== Obtaining ==
=== Harvesting ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Honey farming}}
When a bee nest or beehive at {{cd|honey_level}} 5 is [[Shears|shear]]ed, it drops 3 honeycombs and angers any [[bee]]s inside, causing them to attack. Having a lit [[campfire]] or [[soul campfire]] or lighting a fire underneath the nest or hive prevents the bees from becoming hostile.

A [[dispenser]] with shears inside can be used to shear the nest without angering the bees. The honeycomb pops out as a dropped item.

== Usage ==
=== Signs ===
{{Control|Using}} a honeycomb on a [[sign]] or a [[hanging sign]] prevents the sign from being edited.

=== Waxing ===
{{Control|Using}} a honeycomb on any [[copper]] block including the [[lightning rod]], or on a [[copper golem]], changes the block or golem into its waxed variant, preventing oxidation of the copper.
