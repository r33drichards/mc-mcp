'''[[Options]]'''
* Added a new "Distortion Effects" slider, which affects screen distortion effects such as [[Nausea]] and the [[nether portal]] distortion.
** Ranges from OFF (0%) to 100%.
** As the slider goes lower, a green overlay appears more intensely on the screen.
*** Despite the options menu saying this replaces the Nausea effect at lower levels, it actually acts as an inverse relationship. The distortion is not truly disabled unless the slider is set to "OFF."
* Added a new "FOV Effects" slider.
** Affects intensity of the change of FOV when doing things such as [[sprinting]], aiming a [[bow]], walking on [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]] with [[Soul Speed]], or having the [[Speed]] or [[Slowness]] effects applied.{{more info|Any others?}}
* "Chat Delay" is now also available in chat settings.
** Previously, it was only available in accessibility settings.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''Bubble columns'''
* Affect projectiles as expected.

'''[[Iron Chain|Chain]]s'''
* Can now be placed in all orientations.

'''[[Crimson Roots|Crimson]] and [[warped roots]]'''
* Now require shears to drop.

'''Various non-solid blocks'''
* No longer block projectiles.{{more info}}

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Endermen]]'''
* No longer place their held blocks onto [[bedrock]].
** This is to prevent them from placing blocks on the bedrock ceiling, allowing mobs to spawn.

'''[[Piglin]]s'''
* Now become angry with players who open or destroy a [[minecart with chest]] or [[minecart with hopper]].

'''[[Strider]]s'''
* Now attempt to pathfind to, and stay in [[lava]].

'''[[Strider]] jockeys'''
* The zombified piglin riding a strider now spawns holding a [[warped fungus on a stick]].

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now lose their job sites when changing dimensions.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Soul Speed]]'''
* The Soul Speed boost is now kept when jumping and when the soul block is covered by non-full blocks, such as slabs.

=== General ===
'''[[Custom dimension]]s and [[custom world generation]]'''
* Now use the same folder pattern in data packs as other resources: <samp>namespace/<''type''>/resource.json</samp>.

'''Font'''
* Minor changes to some glyphs.<!-- Default font only -->
