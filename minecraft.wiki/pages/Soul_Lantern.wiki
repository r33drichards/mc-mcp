The '''soul lantern''' is a [[block]] that emits [[light]]. It is a variant of the [[lantern]] crafted from the [[soul torch]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Soul lanterns drop themselves when broken with any tool or without a tool, but [[pickaxe]]s mine them the fastest.

=== Natural generation ===
Soul lanterns can generate in [[ancient cities]].

=== Crafting ===

|C1=Iron Nugget |C2=Iron Nugget |C3=Iron Nugget
|Output=Soul Lantern

== Usage ==
Soul lanterns can be placed on the top or bottom surfaces of most solid [[block]]s, although some require {{control|sneaking}}. More information can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

When placed below a block the soul lantern appears to hang. They connect to [[chain]]s seamlessly.

Soul lanterns can be placed (if a support platform is presented) or hanging (if a ceiling block is presented). The type of the block (solid, opaque, transparent, etc... given the block has top/bottom solid surface) does not affect the ability to hang of a soul lantern, similar to torches. Press use on the targeted block or a block adjacent to the air block the soul lantern is going to occupy to place it. If the latter is used and both the support/ceiling block is presented:

*Press use on the upper half of the adjacent block to "hang" the soul lantern up.
*Press use on the lower half of the adjacent block to "place" the soul lantern down.

If the object the soul lantern is placed on receives a block update that does not support the placement of the soul lantern, it is removed and dropped as an item (e.g: soul lantern on a trapdoor and the trapdoor is flipped).

=== Light ===
The soul lantern emits a light level of 10, five levels less than the normal lantern. Due to their lower light level, soul lanterns do not melt [[snow]] or [[ice]].

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the inside of soul lanterns emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#36d9e6}}. The casing of the soul lantern blocks a part of the light and casts some shadows around the lantern.

=== Piglins ===
Soul lanterns repel [[piglin]]s but not [[piglin brute]]s.

=== Piston interactivity ===
The soul lantern is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
