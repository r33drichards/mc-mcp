'''Fatal Poison''' inflicts [[damage]] to entities over time, and can kill both undead and non-undead mobs, similar to [[Wither (effect)|Wither]]. The effect is actually called "Poison," but its ID distinguishes it from the other [[Poison]] effect, which cannot kill. In Survival mode, the effect applies only to [[Parrot|parrots]] (when feeding them a cookie) and is not obtainable by players.

== Effect ==
The amount of [[damage]] inflicted on the affected entity is shown in the table below:{{verify|edition=bedrock|type=current|This info was most likely calculated for Java Edition and regular Poison; is it also the case for Fatal Poison?}}

The player's hearts turn yellow-green ({{hp|20|poisoned=1|notag=1}}).
Amplifiers outside the range 0–31 (corresponding to levels 1–32) are treated {{w|modulo operation|modulo}} 32 (as though reduced by 32 until they are within the range, or as the remainder from division by 32, i.e. 33 is treated as 1.)

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are unaffected by fatal poison.
*[[Witch]]es are 95% resistant to fatal poison.

== Death message ==
If the player is killed by Fatal Poison, the [[death message]] "<player> was killed by magic" appears, as when killed by a potion of Harming.
