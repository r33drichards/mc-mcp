'''18w15a''' is the thirty-first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on April 11, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w15a|April 11, 2018}}</ref>, which adds most of the features from [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.14.2]]: [[dolphin]]s, [[blue ice]], [[conduit]]s, and [[iceberg]]s.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Blue Ice JE1.png|32px]] [[Blue ice]]'''
* Generates in [[iceberg]]s.
* More slippery than [[ice]] or [[packed ice]].
* Crafted using 9 packed ice.

'''[[File:Conduit.gif|32px]] [[Conduit]]'''
* Crafted using 1 [[heart of the sea]] and 8 [[nautilus shell]]s.
* Can be activated by placing [[prismarine]], [[prismarine bricks]] and/or [[sea lantern]]s in 5&times;5 open squares around it.
* A complete structure fully powers the conduit.
** When active, affects nearby players in water or rain with the [[Conduit Power]] status effect.
*** When active at full power, the range increases and hostile mobs within 8 blocks take damage.
* Emits a strong glow, at light level 15.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Heart of the Sea JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Heart of the sea]]'''
* Used to craft conduits.
* Not available currently in [[Survival]].

'''[[File:Nautilus Shell JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Nautilus shell]]'''
* Used to craft conduits.
* Can be obtained by [[fishing]].
* [[Drowned]] can spawn holding a nautilus shell.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Dolphin Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Dolphin spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Dolphin.gif|32px]] [[Dolphin]]s'''
* Spawn in all oceans except frozen.
* Are neutral. Like [[wolves]] and [[zombie pigmen]], dolphins attack in groups if one is angered.
* Can be fed using [[raw cod]], but they do not breed.
* Sometimes drop cod on death.
* Play with nearby items by picking them up and dropping them after a short moment.
* Occasionally jump out of water.
* Can also jump between disconnected bodies of water.
* Chase after [[boat]]s and jump over water surfaces.
* Suffocate after spending too much time on land.

=== World generation ===
'''{{EnvLink|Iceberg|text=Icebergs}}'''
* Generate in frozen oceans.

=== Effects ===
'''[[File:Conduit Power JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Conduit Power]]'''
* Given when a [[conduit]] is activated.
* Stops the breath meter from running out, gives underwater vision and increases mining speed.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Biome Blend" distance video option.

== Changes ==
=== Fluids ===
'''[[File:Water JE16.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Has a new texture.
* Now only blocks 1 light per block, instead of 3.
** This only affects newly placed water.
* Underwater vision from previous snapshots is gone; water is darker at lower depths.
* Ocean variants have their own water colors, and the swamp water color has been changed.
* In newly generated chunks, it is less likely to find frozen oceans next to warm oceans, etc. It is, however still possible to find warm oceans next to snowy tundra, etc.

=== Mobs ===
'''Spawning'''
* Mobs can now spawn on top of [[ice]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Swimming]]'''
* It is now possible to swim through one block holes again.
* The transition between swimming and normal state is now smoother.
* Sprinting at the surface of water no longer makes the player swim; instead they stay at the same altitude constantly.

=== General ===
'''Optimizations'''
* Optimized fog rendering.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added "Thanks for the fish!".
