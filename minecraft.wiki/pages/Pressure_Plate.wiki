A '''pressure plate''' is a non-solid [[block]] that produces a [[redstone]] signal when stood on by an [[entity]], with multiple variants that have different properties.

A pressure plate can be used to detect entities on top of it (players, mobs, items, etc.).
[[File:Pressure plate.png|thumb|Pressure plates on fences.]]
[[File:Fluids_and_pressure_plates.png|300px|thumb|Pressure plates being used to contain water and lava.]]

To place a pressure plate, {{control|use}} it while aiming at the face of a block adjacent to the destination space.

A pressure plate can be placed on ''top'' of:
* blocks that have a rigid support shape ([[cauldrons]], [[composters]], [[hoppers]], [[stone]], etc).
* blocks that have a center support shape ([[glass panes]], [[fences]], [[walls]], [[stone]], etc).
* any block that has a full top surface, as these blocks fall under the previous two categories ( [[stone]], [[scaffolding]], upside-down [[stairs]], closed [[trapdoors]], etc).
** Some exceptions may apply.

A pressure plate cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the plate to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a plate to the ''side'' of the fence causes the plate to be attached to the ''top'' of the ground next to the fence instead. More information regarding placement on non-[[conductive]] blocks can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

A [[minecart]] traveling on [[rail]]s can activate a pressure plate diagonally adjacent to a curved rail's corner, but not one next to a straight rail (a stone pressure plate cannot be activated by a minecart, but it ''can'' be activated by the minecart's passenger, if present). For a block that works similarly to pressure plates but was designed specifically for minecarts, see [[Detector Rail]].

A pressure plate is not [[Solid_block|solid]] (it is not a barrier to entity movement). A block under a pressure plate can provide a solid surface underneath it (for mobs to walk across, items to fall on, etc.), but when a pressure plate is placed on a block with a small [[collision box]], such as a fence or nether brick fence, it is possible for entities to move through the pressure plate while still activating it (walking through it horizontally, or falling through it vertically). Thus, a pressure plate on a fence can be used to detect entities without stopping them. An entity moving fast enough can phase through a pressure plate without actually activating it.

Pressure plates are 0.0625 blocks high (1⁄16 of a block) when inactive and 0.03125 blocks high (1⁄32 of a block) when active, but because they are not solid they do not affect the position of entities "on top" of them, so a player on top of a pressure plate is actually standing on the block beneath it. 

Unlike similar redstone components, pressure plates cannot be broken by [[water]] and [[lava]], as such they are often used to contain these fluids. {{IN|be}}, pressure plates can be [[waterlogged]].

=== Behavior ===

[[File:Pressure plate as power source.png|thumb|Pressure plate placement and behavior.]]

A pressure plate ''activates'' when an entity is on top of it (specifically, when the entity's [[collision box]] intersects with a space occupied by the pressure plate that's as large as the pressure plate itself, but is 0.25 blocks ({{frac|1|4}} of a block) tall instead of 0.0625 blocks ({{frac|1|16}} of a block), which may include entities flying close to the ground). The activation conditions vary depending on the type of pressure plate.

After being activated, the pressure plate periodically<ref group="n">The time period is specific to the type of pressure plate. This period is 10 game ticks for weighted pressure plates and  20 game ticks for other pressure plates.</ref> checks if there are still entities on top of it. If none are found, the pressure plate returns to its inactive state.

While active, a pressure plate provides weak power to its direct neighbors and strong power to the block below itself.

|{{HistoryLine||1.3|Pressure plates now require only two [[wood planks]]/[[stone]] to [[craft]]; previous versions required three (this recipe now creates [[slab]]s).}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.6|dev=Test Build 3|Both types of pressure plates can now also be recovered by destroying the [[block]] they are on.
|Pressure plates may no longer be placed on [[leaf block]]s or [[TNT]]. Pressure plates placed on such blocks prior to this update drop themselves when disturbed (whether by stepping on them or by placing/breaking adjacent blocks) and can be recollected, though they can still ignite TNT.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7|The model of pressure plates has been changed.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release|Pressure plates can now be placed on [[fence]]s. However, due to the fence's [[collision box]] being 1 block wide and 1.5 blocks tall, they are hard to activate, but not impossible (e.g., [[pistons]] can be used to push a fence to the same position of an entity that's taller than one block, then a pressure plate can be placed on top of the fence).

|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w36a|All [[entities]] are now allowed to trigger weighted pressure plates.
|Weighted pressure plates have been repurposed: rather than outputting based on the amount of and the stack size of [[item entities]], their output now depends on the amount of [[entities]] (including non-item entities) on top of them. As a result, the stack size of item entities is now ignored: for example, dropping a [[stick]] item and a [[dirt]] item on top of a [[light weighted pressure plate]] now results in a higher output signal compared to dropping a full stack of [[sand]] on it (previously, the opposite would've been the case). The original signal strenght values per amount of items are listed below:
