'''Sand''' is a gravity-affected [[block]] found abundantly in [[desert]]s and [[beach]]es, and less commonly in or near surface water.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break sand is a [[shovel]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Sand|Shovel}}
Sand drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Sand generates naturally in many [[biome]]s of the [[Overworld]], in [[disk]]-like formations near ponds and [[river]]s. It generates in abundance in [[desert]]s and [[beach]]es, generally in four-block-deep layers, supported by [[sandstone]] below. Sand also generates as the [[ocean]] floor of lukewarm oceans, deep lukewarm oceans, and warm oceans, in a single layer not supported by sandstone. It usually generates in quantities of 545 blocks per chunk on average in non-desert biomes.{{verify}}

Sand is also used to cover up [[buried treasure]] [[chest]]s, depending on where the chest generates. (In this case, sand is used to cover up buried treasure chests that generate on beaches and ocean floors that are composed of sand, but in some cases, stone or sandstone might be used instead).

Sand also generates as part of warm [[ocean ruins]] and some cold [[ocean ruin]]s, some [[desert]] [[village]] houses, [[desert well]]s, [[desert pyramid]]s, and has a chance to generate in [[trial chamber]] entrances.

Sand can spawn floating in the [[air]]. The floating cluster of sand falls when one of the sand blocks receives an update (e.g. when a block is placed near it or when a block near it is broken).

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a sand block drops the block upon death.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|sand}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 8 sand for 1 [[emerald]]. This is the only renewable method of obtaining sand. Because new wandering traders require at least 20 minutes to spawn and have a limited number of trades per spawn, it is more practical to obtain sand by other means.
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
[[Suspicious sand]] becomes regular sand when [[brush]]ed.

== Usage ==
{{main|Falling Block}}

If the supporting block below a block of sand is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the sand block turns into a "[[falling block]]" [[entity]], which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity is available in the main article listed above.

If falling sand lands and covers the head of a [[mob]] or the [[player]], the mob or player buried in it continuously receives [[suffocation]] damage. If falling sand lands in the space occupied by a non-solid block (such as [[torch]], [[rail]], or [[redstone dust]]) or a block [[Solid block#Height|less than a full block tall]] (such as [[slab]] or [[soul sand]]<ref>{{bug|MC-77079|||WAI}}</ref>), the sand drops and turns into an [[Item (entity)|item]]. If it falls onto a [[cobweb]], it falls slowly until it has gone through completely; if it touches the ground while still inside the cobweb, the sand becomes an item. Sand that falls onto a [[Bubble Column#Upward|lifting bubble column]] floats on top of the water until the bubble column is blocked or removed.

Though [[TNT]] does not break any blocks if it explodes underwater, if sand, [[concrete powder]] (in one-block-deep water only), or [[gravel]] falls and covers the TNT before it explodes, blocks are broken as normal. This trick can be used to collect blocks underwater, or break into underwater structures such as the [[ocean monument]] without mining.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Smelting ingredient ===
{{Smelting
|showname=1
|Sand

}}

=== Farms ===
Sand is required for farming [[cactus]] and can also be used for farming [[bamboo]], [[sugar cane]], and [[kelp]].

=== Turtle eggs ===
A [[turtle egg]] can hatch only if it is placed on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand.

=== Note Blocks ===
Sand can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "snare drum" sound.

=== Ambience ===
[[File:Minimum sand ambience requirements.png|thumb|This block configuration allows the central sand block to rarely play ambient sounds.]]
Sand emits sandy [[Ambience|ambient noises]] independent of the current biome if there is a sand, [[red sand]], [[terracotta]], or [[stained terracotta]] block 8 blocks away in 3 of the 4 horizontal directions. The central sand block must have access to the sky (i.e., should not be covered by any opaque or light-filtering block). The 3 other required blocks can be placed at different Y levels from the central block but must be located on the [[Heightmap#WORLD_SURFACE|world surface]] (i.e., must not have any non-[[air]] blocks above them).

Additional windy ambient sounds play if the sand block is located in a desert, [[badlands]], [[wooded badlands]], or [[eroded badlands]] biome, provided it still meets the conditions described above.

If all the conditions for the respective ambient sounds are met, on each [[tick]] a sand block has an {{frac|1|1600}} chance to play a sandy noise and an {{frac|1|10000}} chance to play a windy sound.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Sand}}

== Trivia ==
*If a block of sand has [[snow]] on it and is made to fall, the snow is destroyed{{only|java}} and does not drop [[snowball]]s.
*Because falling sand is considered an [[entity]], it can be launched in a [[Tutorials/TNT cannons|TNT cannon]], similar to an ignited piece of [[TNT]].
*Sand falls at the same rate when submerged in [[water]], or [[lava]], or [[air]].
*If a [[player]] is standing on a stack of sand or [[gravel]], and the stack falls onto a non-solid block, the player can fall fast enough to take [[damage]] or even die.
*Sand falls through [[torch]]es without breaking, if there is [[air]] below the torch.<ref>{{bug|MC-3262|||WAI}}</ref>
*Sand and [[gravel]] take about 0.45 seconds to fall one meter.
*The sand texture is rotated if a block of sand turns into a <code>falling_block</code> entity, similar to ignited [[TNT]] blocks. This is not the case with [[gravel]].
*Because <code>falling_block</code> is considered an [[entity]], blocks of sand without supports may disappear for a split second and a <code>falling_block</code> entity is summoned. This is also the case when it is landing, but the entity (not the [[block]]) disappears instead before a block is placed.
