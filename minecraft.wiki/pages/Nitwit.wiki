'''Nitwit''' is a [[villager]] profession. Unlike other villagers, they lack a [[workstation]], or even any [[trades]] at all, spending most of their time walking around or sleeping.

== Spawning ==
{{Main|Villager#Spawning}}
=== Natural generation ===
{{IN|je}}, due to a bug, nitwits cannot spawn in through breeding.<ref>{{bug|MC-156556}}</ref> As such, they can only be found naturally or by [[#Curing|curing]] naturally spawned zombie villagers. Zombie villagers can also be spawned as babies, so this is the only way to encounter baby nitwits in Survival mode.

{{IN|be}}, every baby villager has a 10% chance to become a nitwit when they become an adult, as well as having a different sleep schedule where they wander around the village for about 2000 ticks (1 minute 40 seconds) after other villagers go to sleep, before seeking a bed. If they can claim a bed, they arise in the morning 2000 ticks after the rest of the village wakes up.

== Drops ==
Nitwits do not drop experience or items in any circumstance, even when the player has the [[Hero of the Village]] effect, as they do not have professions and cannot trade.

== Behavior ==
{{Main|Villager#Behavior}}
Nitwits cannot change their profession, [[trade]], or gather around [[bell]]s, but are still able to breed. They are not equipped with a level badge visually since they cannot trade.

=== Movement patterns ===
Nitwit leave their homes at day and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, periodically making mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers (nitwits or otherwise) may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, during which they stare at another villager for 4–5 seconds at a time.

When it rains, a nitwit will stay outside longer than others unless being chased by an [[illager]] or [[zombie]].

{{quote|It started because players could summon villagers without a career by using commands: it was the only way to get villagers with green robes. Whenever we discover we have a bug which is used by the community we just see it as 'undefined behaviour' - and 'fix' it by making it a feature. In this case we just needed a profession for the green-robed villager. I don't remember what name we came up with first - I think it was 'unemployed' or something, but it doesn't really fit in the world, because I don't really think the other villagers are employed by anyone either. So I think the next suggestion was 'village idiot' but I thought 'nitwit' was a more fun name.|[[Jeb]] about the Nitwit<ref name="meet-nitwit">{{Mcnet|meet-nitwit|Meet the Nitwit|January 23, 2017}}</ref>||Jens Bergensten Mojang avatar.png}}
