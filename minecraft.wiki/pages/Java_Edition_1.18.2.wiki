'''1.18.2''' is a minor update to {{JE}}, released on February 28, 2022, which adds the {{cmd|placefeature}} command, makes changes to [[tag]]s and [[custom world generation]], and fixes bugs.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-18-2|Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.2|February 28, 2022}}</ref> It is not compatible with [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]] and [[Java Edition 1.18.1|1.18.1]] servers. This is the first version released in 2022.

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[Custom world generation]]'''
* Added <code>biomes</code> field in configured structure files, which is a tag.
* Added {{w|Spline interpolation|spline density}} function: general-purpose building block that allows user to express almost any function using a cubic spline.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|placefeature}}'''
* Used to place a configured feature at a given location.
* Syntax: {{cmd|placefeature <feature> [<pos>]|link=none}}
** <code>feature</code>: The namespaced ID of a configured feature to place.
** <code>pos</code>: The position to use as the origin for the feature placement.
*** If omitted, <code>~ ~ ~</code> is used.

=== General ===
[[File:Regional compliancies notification 1 hour.png|thumb|Notification of playing greater than 1 hour.]]
[[File:Regional compliancies notification 1 day.png|thumb|Notification of playing greater than 24 hours.]]

'''Compliance requirements'''
* Added gameplay timers and notices in compliance with gaming laws of South Korea to South Korean users, in order to remind these players to take occasional breaks from gameplay.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Now contains the chunk position in the region file, and the name of this region file which the player is currently in, at the end of the "Chunk" row.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Friulian.<ref group=note>Also available for versions since [[21w37a]].</ref>

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* Added a JSON file related to the new compliance requirements, located at <samp>assets/[namespace]/regional_compliancies.json</samp>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the {{code|#fall_damage_resetting}} block tag.
** Contains the {{code|#climbable}} block tag, [[sweet berry bush]], and [[cobweb]].
* Tags can now be defined for any types in registry, rather than only blocks, items, fluids, entity types, game events and functions previously.
** In datapacks, tags of new types are stored in their own folders (but not present in the vanilla datapack currently). The folders' names are based on their names in the <samp>registries.json</samp>, for example:
*** Tags for potions: <samp>/data/[namespace]/tags/potion</samp>
*** Tags for biomes: <samp>/data/[namespace]/tags/worldgen/biome</samp>
** For tags of blocks, items, fluids, entity types, game events and functions, their locations in datapacks are currently not changed, even if they use plural names which is against the new name format.
* Added biome tags in vanilla datapacks, as following:
** {{cd|#is_badlands}}: {{cd|d=and|badlands|eroded_badlands|wooded_badlands}}.
** {{cd|#is_beach}}: {{cd|d=and|beach|snowy_beach}}.
** {{cd|#is_deep_ocean}}: {{cd|d=and|deep_frozen_ocean|deep_cold_ocean|deep_ocean|deep_lukewarm_ocean}}.

** {{cd|#is_hill}}: {{cd|d=and|windswept_hills|windswept_forest|windswept_gravelly_hills}}.
** {{cd|#is_jungle}}: {{cd|d=and|bamboo_jungle|jungle|sparse_jungle}}.
** {{cd|#is_mountain}}: {{cd|d=and|meadow|frozen_peaks|jagged_peaks|stony_peaks|snowy_slopes}}.
** {{cd|#is_nether}}: {{cd|d=and|nether_wastes|basalt_deltas|soul_sand_valley|crimson_forest|warped_forest}}.
** {{cd|#is_ocean}}: {{cd|d=and|#is_deep_ocean|frozen_ocean|ocean|cold_ocean|lukewarm_ocean|warm_ocean}}.
** {{cd|#is_river}}: {{cd|d=and|river|frozen_river}}.
** {{cd|#is_taiga}}: {{cd|d=and|taiga|snowy_taiga|old_growth_pine_taiga|old_growth_spruce_taiga}}.
* Added biome tags to determine which biomes a structure can generate in, stored in <samp>tags/worldgen/biome/has_structure</samp>.
** {{cd|values}} field in these files can accept both biome IDs and biome tags.
* Added following configured structure feature tags:
** {{cd|#dolphin_located}}: {{cd|d=and|#ocean_ruin|#shipwreck}}.
** {{cd|#eye_of_ender_located}}: {{cd|stronghold}}.
** {{cd|#mineshaft}}: {{cd|d=and|mineshaft|mineshaft_mesa}}.
** {{cd|#ocean_ruin}}: {{cd|d=and|ocean_ruin_cold|ocean_ruin_warm}}.
** {{cd|#on_ocean_explorer_maps}}: {{cd|monument}}.
** {{cd|#on_treasure_maps}}: {{cd|buried_treasure}}.
** {{cd|#on_woodland_explorer_maps}}: {{cd|mansion}}.
** {{cd|#ruined_portal}}: {{cd|d=and|ruined_portal|ruined_portal_desert|ruined_portal_jungle|ruined_portal_mountain|ruined_portal_nether|ruined_portal_ocean|ruined_portal_swamp}}.
** {{cd|#shipwreck}}: {{cd|d=and|shipwreck|shipwreck_beached}}.
** {{cd|#village}}: {{cd|d=and|village|village_desert|village_plains|village_savanna|village_snowy|village_taiga}}.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Ender chest]]'''
* No longer gift wrapped around Christmas.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Dolphin]]s'''
* Now pick the closest [[structure]] more accurately, regardless of structure type.

'''[[Glow squid]]'''
* Now require complete darkness to spawn.

'''[[Tropical fish]]'''
* Now only spawn if the block above is a full [[water]] block.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Bastion remnant]]'''
* Bounding boxes are now slightly more accurate to the shape of the structure.

'''[[Custom world generation]]'''
* Some fields in worldgen structures that previously only lists of element IDs now accept tags.
** Those entries now accept <code>[id, ...]</code>, <code>id</code> (shortcut for <code>[id]</code>), and <code>#tag</code>.
** Changed fields are:
*** <code>feature.glow_lichen</code> configuration: <code>can_be_placed_on</code>
*** <code>feature.spring_feature</code> configuration: <code>valid_blocks</code>
*** <code>feature.simple_random_selector</code> configuration: <code>features</code>
*** <code>block_predicate_type.matching_blocks</code>: <code>blocks</code>
*** <code>block_predicate_type.matching_fluids</code>: <code>fluids</code>
*** <code>biome</code>: inner list in <code>features</code>, map value in <code>carvers</code>
*** <code>biome_source.checkerboard</code>: <code>biomes</code>
* Some tag fields now require id to be prepended with <code>#</code>, however they are not yet accepting element list:
** <code>dimension_type</code>: <code>infiniburn</code>
** <code>feature.geode</code> configuration: <code>blocks.cannot_replace</code>, <code>blocks.invalid_blocks</code>
** <code>feature.vegetation_patch</code>, <code>feature.waterlogged_vegetation_patch</code> configuration: <code>replaceable</code>
** <code>feature.root_system</code> configuration: <code>root_replaceable</code>
** <code>structure_processor.protected_blocks</code>: <code>value</code>
* Structure fields in noise settings no longer have separate subfields for strongholds and non-stronghold structures. Instead each structure has a tag field which is <code>tag</code>: <code>concentric_rings</code> for strongholds and <code>tag</code>: <code>random_spread</code> for non-stronghold structures.

'''[[Seed (world generation)|Seed]]'''
* A seed of the number zero is no longer handled as a special case.
* Any spaces before/after an inputted seed are trimmed.

'''[[Superflat]]'''
* "Redstone Ready" preset's top layer of blocks has increased to height Y=55 instead of Y=-9 in order to prevent [[slimes]] from spawning.
* Changed the "Water World" preset, by replacing [[sand]] with [[gravel]], and adding additional 64 layers of [[deepslate]] above the [[bedrock]] layer, in order to fix the [[ocean monument]] generation issue in worlds using this preset.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Now uses a namespaced ID parameter.
* Now support [[tag]]s, using {{cd|#}} prefix to distinguish from normal IDs.
* The parameter is now a configured structure rather than a structure type.
** For instance, it is now possible to use {{cmd|locate village_desert}} or {{cmd|locate shipwreck_beached}}.
* The old usage for structure categories is now done via tags.
** For instance, {{cmd|locate village}} is now {{cmd|locate #village}}.

'''{{cmd|locatebiome}}'''
* Now support tags, using {{cd|#}} prefix to distinguish from normal IDs.
** For instance, it is now possibile to use {{cmd|locatebiome #minecraft:has_structure/igloo}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Increased data pack version from <code>8</code> to <code>9</code>.
* It is now possible to add custom structures in experimental datapacks: the game now generates and stores data-driven configured structures.
** Experimental datapacks can add new structure sets.
** The {{cd|feature}} field in location predicates now references a configured feature.
** The {{cd|exploration_map}} loot table function {{cd|destination}} field is now a configured feature tag id.
** The {{cd|exploration_map}} loot table function no longer automatically sets the display name of the map.
* A lot of the cave generation is now configurable through data packs.
** A new registry was added for Density functions (caves are created by combining those together).
** Noise settings got a new field {{cd|noise_router}} (and lost a couple of flags), see {{samp|worldgen/noise_settings}} folder in the worldgen report.
** Noise router wires data-driven parts of the cave generation with the rest of the code.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Moved the location of the player within a chunk from "Chunk" row, into the new square brackets at the end of the "Block" row.
* Merged the "Terrain" and "Multinoise" row into the "NoiseRouter" row, with the format {{cd|NoiseRouter T: ''data'' H: ''data'' C: ''data'' E: ''data'' D: ''data'' W: ''data'' PV: ''data'' AS: ''data'' N: ''data''}}.
** {{cd|d=and|T|H|C|E|W}} are the same with data from the former "Multinoise" row.
** {{cd|PV}} is the same with data from the former "Terrain" row.
** {{cd|d=and|D|AS|N}} are the depth, initial density without jaggedness, and final density value used for terrain generation.

'''Logging'''
* Upgrades log4j to 2.17.0.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* [[Powder snow]] is no longer part of the {{code|#goats_spawnable_on}} block tag.
* [[Snow block]]s and powder snow are now part of the {{code|#azalea_root_replaceable}} block tag.
* Removed [[dirt]] from the {{cd|#dripstone_replaceable_blocks}} block tag.
* Removed {{cd|#lush_ground_replaceable}}, and added {{cd|d=and|#base_stone_overworld|#dirt|clay|gravel|sand}} block tags to the {{cd|#azalea_root_replaceable}} block tag.

'''General'''
* Added a warning for users running Minecraft in a 32-bit environment in the main menu, because support for the 32-bit environment is ending.
