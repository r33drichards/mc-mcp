== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Banner]]s'''
* Now have some new patterns.
** 'Cross' which puts a cross on the banner (slightly thinner than when using stripes).

** 'Curly border' which adds a more decorative border.
** 'Mojang logo' which adds the Mojang logo.

But probably also some more black patches, so we can lure trees back in|July 24, 2014}}</ref>

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* Fixed [[:File:Chunk rendering precision loss 2.png|a very major rendering bug]] that occurred in 14w30a and 14w30b at high coordinates for many GPUs{{verify}} if VBOs were disabled.
