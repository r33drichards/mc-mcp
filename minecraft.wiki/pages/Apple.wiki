'''Apples''' are [[food]] items that can be eaten by the [[player]] or crafted into [[golden apple]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Block loot ===

Oak and dark oak [[leaves]] have 0.5% ({{frac|1|200}}) chance of dropping an apple when decayed or broken, but not if burned. Breaking leaves with a [[tool]] enchanted with the [[Fortune]] enchantment increases the chances of dropping an apple: 0.556% ({{frac|1|180}}) with Fortune I, 0.625% ({{frac|1|160}}) with Fortune II, and 0.833% ({{frac|1|120}}) with Fortune III.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|apple}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management|title1=Hunger management}}

To eat an apple, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|4}} [[hunger]] and 2.4 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Placing an apple into a [[composter]] has a 65% ({{frac|13|20}}) chance of raising the compost level by 1.
