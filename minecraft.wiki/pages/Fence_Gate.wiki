A '''fence gate''' is a block that shares the functions of both the [[door]] and the [[fence]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A fence gate can be {{control|broken}} with anything, but an [[axe]] is fastest.

== Usage ==
=== Placing ===
[[File:Wheat farm with fences.png|A fence gate can provide access to a fenced-in area.|thumb]]

A fence gate can be used as a switchable barrier that can be opened and closed by hand, by a [[Wind Charge|wind charge]] or by redstone power.

When {{control|placed}}, a fence gate automatically faces toward the player who placed it, regardless of any other fences around it.

A fence gate can be placed whether there is a solid block beneath it or not.

[[Fence]]s, [[nether brick fence]]s and [[wall]]s connect to fence gates, but [[glass pane]]s and [[iron bars]] do not. A fence gate floats in mid-air when placed with no connection to anything else.

=== Barrier ===
A fence gate can be opened or closed by {{control|using}} it. When a fence gate opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it "passes through"—moving fence gates don't push entities the way that pistons do. When opened by hand, a fence gate always opens away from the player.

A fence gate can also be opened or closed by wind charges shot by the player, a [[dispenser]] or a [[breeze]]. When hit, it opens if closed and vice versa.

Although a fence gate appears to be only one block tall, a closed fence gate is a barrier one and a half blocks high. Most mobs cannot jump over a fence gate, and entities on top of the fence gate stand half a block above it.

An open fence gate is completely non-solid, similar to a [[sign]] or a [[torch]].<ref>{{bug|MC-252813||Open fence gates don't have any collision|WAI}}</ref> Multiple open fence gates next to each other can be passed through as if the entire space is open.

Hostile mobs recognize closed fence gates as a block and cannot detect players through it unless they were already detected.

The sound of opening and closing of a fence gate can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most [[mob]] sounds.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A fence gate can be controlled with redstone power.

A fence gate is a [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|redstone mechanism]] and can be activated by:
* an adjacent active '''[[Redstone components#Power components|power component]]''', including above or below: for example, a [[redstone torch]], a [[block of redstone]], a [[daylight sensor]], etc.
* an adjacent '''powered block''' (for example, a block with an active redstone torch under it), including above or below
* a powered '''[[redstone comparator]]''' or '''[[redstone repeater]]''' facing the fence gate
* powered '''[[redstone dust]]''' configured to point at the fence gate or a directionless "dot" next to it; a fence gate is ''not'' activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.

When activated, a fence gate opens immediately. When deactivated, a fence gate closes immediately.

An activated fence gate can still be closed by a player, and won't re-open until it receives a new activation signal. (That is, if a fence gate has been closed "by hand", it still needs to be deactivated and then reactivated to open by redstone).

Fence gates can be moved by pistons. When an activated fence gate is moved by a piston to a position where it shouldn't be activated, it doesn't change its state until it receives a redstone update.

=== Fuel ===
Overworld wooden fence gates can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per fence gate.

=== Note blocks ===
Fence gates can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

=== Helmet ===

While a fence gate cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear as eyeglasses.
