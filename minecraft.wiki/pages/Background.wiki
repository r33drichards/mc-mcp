{{For|the background shown in the [[title screen]]|Panorama}}
The '''background''' is a decorative background of a GUI displayed during [[dimension]] teleporting, in some [[menu screen]]s, and the [[end poem]].

== Backgrounds ==
{{IN|java}}, backgrounds are only used when teleporting to another dimension. When teleporting to or from the [[Overworld]] or [[custom dimension]]s, a blurred [[panorama]] is displayed in the background instead. When teleporting to [[The Nether]], the texture of the [[Nether Portal (block)|nether portal]] is displayed. When teleporting to [[The End]], the texture of the [[End Portal (block)|end portal]] is displayed.

{{IN|bedrock}}, dirt backgrounds only appear in the credits, on connection error screens, and on the loading screen when teleporting to the [[Overworld]] using a nether portal.

Despite the texture of dirt being changed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5]] and [[Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha]], the dirt backgrounds still use the old texture, except the dirt background when teleporting to the Overworld.{{only|BE}}<ref name="dirt">{{bug|MC-198202}}</ref>
