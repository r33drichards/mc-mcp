'''Potato flowers''' are decorative [[flower]]s that generate naturally in the [[Poisonous Potato Dimension|Potato]] in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A potato flower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A potato flower also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Potato flowers generate naturally in the [[Potato dimension]], in all biomes except the [[hash]] biome.

Potato flowers also generate naturally in [[birch forest]]s.

== Usage ==
=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with potato flowers, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1. These flowers can also be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead bees.

=== Suspicious stew ===
A potato flower can be used for crafting a [[suspicious stew]], which gives the [[Poison]] effect to the player for 12 seconds after eating it.
