[[File:Alex scoping Spyglass.png|right|100px]]

To use a spyglass, the player selects it from the hotbar and clicks {{control|use}} while looking in the desired direction.

Spyglasses are used to zoom in on a specific location in the player's field of view (FOV). The spyglass changes the FOV to {{frac|1|10}} of the FOV set in [[options]]. By default, the FOV is set to 70° in ''Java Edition'' and 60° in Bedrock Edition, resulting in an FOV of 7° in ''Java Edition'' and 6° in Bedrock Edition through the spyglass. The player's FOV can be set from 30° to 110°, so the spyglass FOV can  range from 3° to 11°. Regardless of the situation, or status effects the player has, using the Spyglass always shows a FOV {{frac|1|10}} of the FOV set in [[options]].

A square vignette is applied when in use, similar to the effect when wearing a [[carved pumpkin]]. Pressing {{key|F1}} removes the vignette,{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-203575||The spyglass overlay goes away when pressing F1|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-125869||Spyglass's overlay don't go away even if the player toggles Hide GUI on/ Pressing F1|WF}}</ref> similar to a carved pumpkin. 

Hazy distant objects remain hazy when viewed in the spyglass. Mobs too distant to render also do not render in the spyglass. The spyglass shows a magnified view of what the player already sees.

The player is slowed down while watching through the spyglass. Camera movement damping can be adjusted in the controls [[settings]] {{in|be}}. When the player uses the spyglass continuously for {{convert|1|minute|game tick}}, the interface is automatically closed.

If the player has a certain effect on their screen like [[fire]], the spyglass does not remove that effect on the player's screen.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* If {{command|item replace}} is used to place a spyglass on a [[player]]'s head, the item appears stuck to the center of the player's face.
* If loaded in an outdated world {{in|Bedrock}}, it has no texture, but can still be used.
