The '''Seecret Updates'''{{sic}} were a series of ten updates released by [[Notch]] during the [[Infdev]] and [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] development stages of ''[[Minecraft]]'', often without announcement. They were named after the day of the week on which they were released: nine '''Seecret Friday Updates''' were released on Fridays from [[Infdev (June 18, 2010)|June 18]] to [[Alpha v1.1.0|September 10, 2010]], and a '''Seecret Saturday Update''' was released on [[Alpha v1.1.1|Saturday, September 18, 2010]]. Seecret Updates usually included major new features: [[minecart]]s and [[boat]]s, [[redstone]], and [[sneaking]] were all introduced in these updates, along with a number of other significant features.

Notch sometimes announced or confirmed upcoming Seecret Updates on Twitter. On June 18, before the release of Seecret Friday Update 1, he tweeted that he was going to "do a seecret update".<ref>{{tweet|notch|16458774638|I think ill do a seecret update today! OooooOOOoo!|Jun 18, 2010}}</ref> On July 2, he announced that Seecret Friday Update 3 was coming that night.<ref>{{tweet|notch|17578712007|At birthday party now, the seecret update is coming tonight. It's a beautiful day for a badali. :)|Jul 2, 2010}}</ref> On July 29, he tweeted that there was "a real chance I might forget to do the update",<ref>{{tweet|notch|19830960174|@tinydimension There's a real chance I might forget to do the update. :D|Jul 29, 2010}}</ref> in reference to Seecret Friday Update 7, released the next day. On September 2, he refused to do a "Seecret Monday Update", instead confirming that "the secret update will be on friday as.. er.. "normal"",<ref>{{tweet|notch|22796235290|@sw17ch No, the secret update will be on friday as.. er..

Seecret Updates were discontinued before the [[Halloween Update]]; Notch tweeted on October 7 that they were "postponed until we know what to do with them" and that he was "focusing on the Halloween update and lawyers".<ref>{{tweet|notch|26685344731|The secret friday updates are postponed until we know what to do with them. For now, I'm focusing on the Halloween update and lawyers.|Oct 7, 2010}}</ref> The last mention of them on [[The Word of Notch]] was in a blog post made on September 24, where he wrote "I'd really like to do a Seecret Friday update, both to keep you guys happy and to actually get to do some programming myself, but I need to wind down",<ref>[[wordofnotch:1177733208|Recharging the batteries, bribing city states.]]</ref> and the last time he tweeted about them<!-- that I could find --> was on November 10, where he wrote "I liked the Friday updates, but Saturday fixes suck."<ref>{{tweet|notch|29594045883|@Brash_Endeavors I'll keep working on it after release.
