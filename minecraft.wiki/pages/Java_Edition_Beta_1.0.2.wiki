This version was reuploaded at 08:41 UTC<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(03:42:54) <shadoom> 1.0.2 out ! :D</ref> for fixing a bug with starting the game, which makes the pre-reupload version unplayable.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(03:42:27) <Typo91> minecraft 90% loading ERROR"..."(03:43:01) <Youhan> Just says "Done Loading""</ref>

''Beta 1.0.1'' does not exist; that version is instead called [[Beta 1.0_01]].

== Fixes ==
'''1 bug fixed'''
* The game now runs properly on macOS.

== Trivia ==
* This version breaks the [[Version formats|version numbering convention]] of [[Beta 1.0]], seeing as other patches are numbered with "_0''n''", with ''n'' being the patch number. However, Beta 1.0.2 was never called Beta 1.0_02, therefore breaking the numbering convention. 
** This is not the only Beta patch version that does this, [[Beta 1.7_01]] does too.
