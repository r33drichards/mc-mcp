The '''termite''' was a proposed [[mob]] that was featured in the Biome Chooser at [[MINECON Earth 2018]], alongside the [[ostrich]], [[meerkat]] and [[fox]]. It was shown to be tiny and crawling on a mound in [[savanna]]s; however, proper mechanics were never established.

It, along with the rest of the biome, made it to the second round with 27.6%, but lost with 34.7%. Unlike other mobs featured in [[Mob Vote]]s and similar events, it would not be featured in the [[2023 Mob Vote Event]].
