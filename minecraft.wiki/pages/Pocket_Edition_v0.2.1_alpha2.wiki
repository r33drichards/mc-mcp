A demo version of v0.2.1 alpha2 was released on Google Play on August 15, 2012. This was the final version of ''Pocket Edition Demo''/''Lite''.

Unlike the full version, the demo version does not have the ability to save worlds, and only 18 out of the total 36 blocks can be selected in the inventory in the demo version. The demo's internal version is the same as the full version; however, it is 2.84 MB in size, instead of 2.81 MB in the full version.
