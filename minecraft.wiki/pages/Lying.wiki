[[File:Kai Lying.png|150px|right]]'''Lying''' is a position that happens to a [[player]] or certain [[mob]]s under different circumstances.

== Mechanics ==
All mobs can be made to lie in [[bed]]s using [[commands]]. In addition, multiple mobs can sleep as part of their natural behavior. Both player and mob [[hitbox]]es are reduced to 0.2 blocks when lying.

=== Players ===
[[Player]]s lie down when sleeping in a bed. Currently, this is the only way that a player can adopt the lying position. Players cannot move or use items while doing so, unlike with [[sitting]]. Instead of moving their arms slightly forward and back like in the idle animation, they move their arms side to side slowly.

=== Villagers ===
[[Villager]]s lie down when using a bed. They can be woken and removed from their bed by either breaking the bed, pushing them out of the bed, attacking them, or pressing {{Ctrl|use}} on the bed.

=== Cats ===
[[Cat]]s lie, and sleep, on beds whenever their owner is sleeping on one. They purr every 5 ticks{{only|JE}}/once{{only|BE}} when doing so.

=== Foxes ===
[[Fox]]es occasionally lie down and sleep during the day, taking shelter beneath blocks when doing so. Shade is a necessity for sleeping; if a path for direct sunlight is created that lights up a sleeping fox, it immediately wakes and tries to sleep elsewhere. Foxes are currently the only mob to switch to a texture with their eyes shut upon entering their sleeping state.

=== Pandas ===
Lazy [[panda]]s occasionally lie on their backs. Unlike with other mobs, this is a passive action, which is unrelated to sleeping.
