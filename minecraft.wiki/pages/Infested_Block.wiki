An '''infested block''' is a [[stone]], stone variant or [[deepslate]] block inhabited by a [[silverfish]], which can break out if it is mined or a nearby silverfish is attacked. Infested blocks break more quickly, do not drop as [[item]]s and can be safely cleaned of infestation using [[Silk Touch]].

== Obtaining ==
Infested blocks are not obtainable by [[Silk Touch]]. They are available only through the Creative inventory or [[commands]]. However, they can be retained from worlds played in versions where they were legitimately obtainable.

=== Breaking ===
[[File:Silverfish infest anim.gif|thumb|right|Breaking an infested block by hand. More silverfish appear when attacking the first one.]]
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Infested Stone, Infested Stone Bricks; Infested Cobblestone; Infested Deepslate|Pickaxe;Pickaxe;Pickaxe|drop=0;0;0}}
When the block is broken, whether by a [[player]] or by an [[explosion]], a [[silverfish]] spawns where it was broken unless the [[difficulty]] is Peaceful or the [[game rule]] <code>doTileDrops</code> is set to <code>false</code> (<code>doMobSpawning</code> is irrelevant).

Infested blocks take less time to break than their normal counterparts. When breaking them with a [[pickaxe]], they take half as much time to break as their normal counterparts.

When mined with anything other than a [[Silk Touch]]-enchanted tool, an infested block drops nothing and spawns a silverfish that immediately attacks the player. If the player attacks a silverfish directly with a [[sword]], [[bow]], or [[potion of Harming]], or when a silverfish takes [[Poison]] damage, nearby infested blocks break, spawning more aggressive silverfish. If the silverfish is killed in one hit, then nearby infested blocks do not break, and no silverfish spawn from them.<ref>{{bug|MC-2432|||WAI}}</ref>

When mined with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the equivalent non-infested block is dropped without spawning a silverfish.<ref>{{bug|MC-48184|||WAI}}</ref> This may be ''any'' tool (including [[sword]]s), meaning a pickaxe is not required to harvest the block.

=== Natural generation ===
Infested stone bricks are occasionally found in [[stronghold]]s and [[igloo]] basements in place of normal stone bricks. Infested mossy and chiseled stone bricks also generate in [[igloo]] basements, but they do not generate naturally in [[stronghold]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-140209|||Invalid}}</ref>

Infested [[cobblestone]] is found in the rarely generated [[Woodland_Mansion#Rooms|"End portal" room]] in [[woodland mansion]]s.

Infested [[stone]] and [[deepslate]] can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[Ore (feature)|blob]]s. Infested blocks attempt to generate 14 times per [[chunk]] in ore features of size 0-13{{only|je|short=1}}/0-10{{only|be|short=1}}, from [[altitude]]s -64 to 63 {{in|java}} or 0 to 64 {{in|bedrock}}, within one of the following [[biome]]s, or within a chunk that is at least partially occupied by one of these biomes:

* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Gravelly Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
* {{BiomeLink|Cherry Grove}}
* {{BiomeLink|Grove}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes}}
* {{BiomeLink|Jagged Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Frozen Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Stony Peaks}}

Infested stone can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. If it replaces tuff or deepslate, it becomes infested deepslate.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
Infested blocks are generated when a [[silverfish]] enters the respective normal block form.

== Usage ==
When mined, an infested block spawns a silverfish that immediately attacks the player. If the player attacks a [[silverfish]] directly with a [[sword]], [[bow]], or [[potion of Harming]], or when a silverfish takes poison damage, nearby infested blocks break, spawning more aggressive silverfish. If the silverfish is killed in one hit, then nearby infested blocks do not break, and no silverfish spawn from them.

A silverfish does not spawn if the block is destroyed by the [[ender dragon]].

=== Identifying ===
[[Note block]]s placed on infested blocks produce flute sounds{{only|bedrock}} or harp sounds{{only|java}}, while those placed on non-infested blocks produce bass drum sounds.

A player can distinguish infested blocks from their non-infested counterparts by observing that an infested block breaks faster than the block it appears to be, with or without a pickaxe.

{{IN|java}}, using the [[debug screen]], a player can identify whether or not a block is infested.
