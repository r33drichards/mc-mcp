[[File:Friends.png|thumb|The nine default skins of ''Minecraft'' from left to right: [[Sunny]], [[Kai]], [[Makena]], [[Steve]], [[Alex]], [[Zuri]], [[Efe]], [[Ari]], and [[Noor]].]]

'''Skins''' refer to the textures that are placed onto the [[player]] character model. Skins can be easily created using a skin editor.

== Properties ==
Skins are divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.) They are stored as 64×64 templates, consisting of two layers of 1,632 usable pixels, making 3,264 total. In ''Bedrock Edition'', players can also use 128×128 templates, consisting of two layers of 6,528 usable pixels, making 13,056 total. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories (even a bigger head).

Skins set to "slim" lose 25% of their arms' width, and the rightmost pixels in the skins' images are ignored. Slim skins from 64×64 templates have two layers of 1,568 usable pixels, making 3,136 total, and slim skins from 128×128 templates have two layers of 6,272 usable pixels, making 12,544 total.

In {{BE}}, if players set any of their top or bottom layer pixel opacities to 25 (≈10%) or lower, those pixels will appear completely invisible, and if their opacities are 26 or higher, they will appear completely visible.

In {{JE}}, any pixels on the bottom layer of uploaded skins will become fully visible if not already, but their red, green, and blue values will be rounded to parts per opacity value instead of parts per 255 (then will be rounded back into parts per 255), or will appear black if opacity is 0. For example, if a pixel's red, green, and blue values are 255, 13, 142, with an opacity of 2, their red, green, and blue values will be rounded to parts per two, as one of 0/2, ~1/2, or 2/2 (0, 128, or 255), and become 255, 0, 128, with an opacity of 255.

Pixel size of the 2nd layer on body, arms and legs is 0.25 pixel bigger than the skin pixel (inner layer). For head 2nd layer (Hat layer) it is 0.5 pixels bigger than the skin layer (inner layer).

== World textures ==
{{main|Resource pack}}

A skin can also refer to other textures in the game, such as block textures, item sprites, mob skins, etc. A list of these can be found [[Resource pack|here]].

It is worth noting that a [[zombie]] and its variants can use typical player skins (and vice-versa). [[Skeleton]] mobs can use typical player skins as well, but keep in mind that they have their skinny arms and legs. If a skeleton mob skin is used as a player's skin, their legs and arms do not appear skinny.

In order to use the player skin for zombies, the user must align it to the correct place on the {{cd|.png}} to avoid a visual break in the texture.

== Changing or installing player skins ==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
Only players who have purchased ''Minecraft'' can change their character's skin. This is done on the <span class="plainlinks">[https://minecraft.net/profile profile page]</span> or in the ''Minecraft Launcher'' by uploading a valid {{cd|.png}} texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.<gallery>

</gallery>Skins also have the option of having either 3 or 4 pixel wide arms, which can be changed on the profile page as well.<ref>{{tweet|MojangSupport|511889676227989504|Slim-armed skins are now available to all! Visit http://minecraft.net/profile to make changes, or https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/979200-minecraft-skins for help! ^MW|September 16, 2014}}</ref>

The {{cd|steve.png}} and {{cd|alex.png}} files in [[client.jar]] can also be changed and replaced via a resource pack, but the effects are visible only to players using the resource pack, and affects all players with the default skin.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Players can choose one of the nine default skins upon first launch or in the dressing room, between [[Steve]], [[Alex]], [[Ari]], [[Kai]], [[Noor]], [[Sunny]], [[Zuri]], [[Efe]], or [[Makena]], or they can import their own custom skin on Windows and mobile devices in the dressing room or manually in {{Cd|[[com.mojang]]/custom_skins}}. The player must select a valid skin image file from their file explorer/photo gallery (a {{cd|.png}} texture from 64x32, 64x64, or 128x128 pixels), and must choose between the two model sizes (classic/slim). Players can also spend [[minecoins]] to buy [[skin pack]]s from the [[Marketplace]]. The player has to sign in to their Microsoft (or their respective console account on PlayStation/Nintendo) to access all the skins they owned and bought from the Marketplace.

Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a {{cd|manifest.json}} file, a {{cd|skins.json}} file, and all the desired skins. An additional {{cd|.lang}} file can be added inside a folder labeled {{cd|texts}} to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.

== Character creator ==
{{main|Character creator}}
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=yes}}
[[File:Character creator.png|thumb|The character creator menu.]]
The '''character creator''' is a feature {{in|bedrock}} (and was {{in|earth}} until discontinuation) that lets players customize their skins with free and paid-for cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the dressing room button on the main menu. Many clothing items cost [[Marketplace|Minecoins]] (Tokens on PlayStation 4) or can be earned by completing certain [[achievement]]s. It can also be used to equip [[cape]]s, and also changing player skin sizes.

== Skin packs ==
{{main|Skin pack}}

Skin packs are collections of multiple wearable skins and available {{in|bedrock}} as downloadable content. They can be acquired through:
*The [[Marketplace]], which officially hosts a large number of skin packs by Mojang Studios and their partners. Most of them cost Minecoins (Tokens on PS4), but some have been released for free.
*The {{cd|.mcskin}} files put in the {{cd|skin_packs}} or {{cd|development_skin_packs}} folder in the game files (may be inaccessible on consoles).
*External sources such as community hosted repositories for skin packs.

=== ''Java Edition'' skin packs ===
The following skin packs were released on minecraft.net by Mojang Studios for certain events.

''There might be more Java Edition exclusive skin packs released by Mojang Studios not yet listed in this table.''

<!-- Linked from https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/979200 -->
Many players prefer their own unique skin. While many premade skins can be found online, many players prefer to create their own.

A custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made [[Programs and editors/Skinning and texturing|skin editors]], or by editing the {{cd|steve.png}} or {{cd|alex.png}} file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The {{cd|steve.png}} file can be downloaded [http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/steve.png here] and the {{cd|alex.png}} file [http://assets.mojang.com/SkinTemplates/alex.png here]. When editing the {{cd|steve.png}} or {{cd|alex.png}} file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, ''Minecraft'' may fail to recognize the skin as intended.

Alternatively, some may find it easier to use a program, either downloadable or in-browser, which provides a live view of their character on a three-dimensional model as they are editing the skin. For example, programs may further assist players by providing them with a wide variety of pre-made selections (such as hats, boots, sweaters, etc.) to give the skin creator exactly what they want, even if the creator has little to no artistic skill.

After making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the {{cd|steve.png}} file directly, one still needs to upload the {{cd|.png}} file at the Skin section of the Profile page on [[Minecraft.net]] (found [https://minecraft.net/profile/skin here]) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.

== Number of Skins ==
The total number of possible unique player skins varies immensely, depending on version, as well as what is considered unique. Below are tables with the number of unique skins on Java and Bedrock Edition, with cells within rows and columns that correspond to different rules. Cells in the left columns consider all completely transparent pixels to be the same, while the ones on the right consider them to be unique.

The formulae below can be used to find the number of skins with a given width, template dimensions, etc. It essentially finds the number of potential states for pixels on the bottom layer, multiplies that by the number of potential states for pixels on the top layer, then sets that to the power of the total number of pixels on each layer.

<math>\left(v_b\times v_t\right)^{\left(86+16A\right)\times t^2}</math>, where:

<math>v_b=\begin{cases}
2^{24}\left(\alpha_b-1\right)+1 & \text{if } s\land \alpha_b\ne1
\\ 2^{24}\alpha_b & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}</math> is the number of possible values for each bottom layer pixel

<math>v_t=\begin{cases}
2^{24}\left(\alpha_t-1\right)+1 & \text{if } s\land \alpha_t\ne1
\\ 2^{24}\alpha_t & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}</math> is the number of possible values for each bottom layer pixel

<math>\alpha_b</math> is the number of possible opacity values for each bottom layer pixel

<math>a_t</math> is the number of possible opacity values for pixels on the top layer.

<math>t</math> is the thickness, equal to the number of pixels wide legs are: 4 for 64×64, 8 for 128×128 

<math>A</math> is the arm thickness/thickness ratio: 1 for wide, 0.75 for slim

<math>s</math> is the "sameness" of 0-alpha pixels: True if all 0-alpha pixels are considered the same regardless of color, False otherwise


In an AntVenom video, he calculated a total of 2<sup>81600</sup> × 5<sup>3264</sup> (≈3.060 133 22<s>0</s>1 × 10<sup>26845</sup>) skins. The rules he used were to include only wide skins, allow transparent pixels only on the top layer, consider all fully transparent pixels to be unique, and include only 100 possible opacity values (''α<sub>b</sub>'' = 1, ''α<sub>t</sub>'' = 100'', t'' = 4, ''A'' = 1, ''s'' = 0).
