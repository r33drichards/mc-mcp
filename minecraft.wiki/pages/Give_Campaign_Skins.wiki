'''Give Campaign Skins''' are four [[skin pack]]s, namely '''Brody's Give Campaign Skin''', '''Claire's Give Campaign Skin''', '''Joslyn's Give Campaign Skin''' and '''Lucy's Give Campaign Skin''', that include 1 skin each. Each skin pack was given to a Microsoft employee who won it during a "Give Campaign" auction, an auction held internally each year at Microsoft to raise funds for non-profit organizations.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20191008-00/?p=102970|title=Auctioning off the privilege of initiating the destruction of the Microsoft old campus|website=Microsoft Developer Blogs|author=Raymond Chen|date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>
