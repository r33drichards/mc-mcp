A '''potato fruit''' is a food block that generates as part of potato trees in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Potato fruit drops as an item when mined with any tool or by hand, but mining it with a sword is the fastest.

{{breaking row|Potato Fruit|sword=1|horizontal=1}} <!-- Not sure if this produces the correct time, the block is kinda weird -->

=== Natural generation ===
Potato fruits generate naturally as part of [[potato tree]]s, and in piles in [[potato village]]s.

== Usage ==
To eat potato fruit, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating potato fruit restores {{hunger|6}} hunger and inflicts [[Poison]] for 2 seconds.
