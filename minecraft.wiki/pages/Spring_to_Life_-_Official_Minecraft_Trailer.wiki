== Summary ==
In a [[swamp]] full of fireflies, three heroes emerge riding [[Pig|pigs]] of different backgrounds. [[Zuri]] is leading, before [[Steve]] and [[Makena]] go their separate ways, Zuri going into a [[Snowy Taiga|snowy taiga]] [[village]]. While there, they meet several cold mobs, and a cold [[chicken]] lays a [[Blue Egg|blue egg]] on a cold [[cow]]'s head. Several cows fight for Zuri's pig's attention. before Zuri receives a [[map]] from a [[cartographer]].

Meanwhile, Makena is in a [[desert]], looking down at their own map. A warm [[Chicken Jockey|chicken jockey]] and several other [[Husk|husks]] try to ambush them, while a warm cow and pig admire a [[Cactus Flower|cactus flower]]. Steve is having less trouble, building a tent while it rains in an [[Old Growth Birch Forest|old growth birch forest]], before overhearing a wandering trader. Suddenly, lightning strikes, destroying Steve's tent. In spite of this loss, Steve's pig decides to happily skedaddle about, intercut with Zuri and Makena's pigs doing the same.

Zuri ends up falling off a cliff, while Makena runs away from monsters emerging from a cave. Steve actually manages to fight several monsters in a swamp, before their friends appear. Zuri appears to get overwhelmed in the chaos, watching as several monsters attack Steve and Makena, all while the three pigs don't care at all.
