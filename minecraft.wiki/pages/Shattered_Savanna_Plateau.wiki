The '''shattered savanna plateau''' or '''savanna plateau mutated''' was a rare variant of the [[savanna]] biome that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed {{in|je}}.

== Description ==
Like the normal windswept savanna, the shattered savanna plateau variant featured steep mountains, cliffs, and overhangs, which made it a treacherous place to explore. Though it was nearly indistinguishable from the regular shattered savanna at first glance, the shattered plateau's terrain was slightly gentler, though often risked fatal fall [[damage]] if not above [[water]]. The giant lakes characteristic of the regular shattered savanna did not generate here either. The terrain generation in the shattered savanna plateau ignored the generation height limit, allowing for mountains that could rarely reach the build height limit. This made it the highest biome in the game.

{{IN|BE}}, the foliage was a more vibrant green color, and rain would often occur in it.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-34936||Tall birch tree, shattered savanna, badlands plateau, and dark forest biomes have wrong grass color}}</ref> Neither [[village]]s nor [[pillager outpost]]s could generate in this biome.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], shattered savanna plateaus use warmish atmospherics, lighting, and color grading similar to [[jungles]], although they use default volumetric [[fog]].

== Mobs ==
Shattered savanna plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as savannas.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
