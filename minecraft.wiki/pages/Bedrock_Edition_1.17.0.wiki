=== Blocks ===
'''[[Amethyst Bud]]'''
* Grows from [[budding amethyst]], which is found in amethyst geodes.
* Starts out tiny, but grows into medium after a while, large after even more time, and eventually becomes an amethyst cluster.
* Unlike crops, each growth stage is a separate block instead of a block state.
* Drops only when mined with a [[Silk Touch]] pickaxe.
* There is a total of 3 variants (stages).

'''[[Amethyst Cluster]]'''
* The final, mature stage of the amethyst bud, which grows from budding amethyst in amethyst geodes.
* Drops amethyst shards if broken, in an amount affected by [[Fortune]], but can also be picked up with Silk Touch.
** Breaking by hand, [[piston]], or other means drops only 2 amethyst shards; mining with a [[pickaxe]] drops 4.
* Emits a light level of 5.

'''[[Azalea]]'''
* Bush-like blocks that can be planted on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s.
* Has variants with either no blossoms or pink blossoms.
* Both variants can grow from moss blocks when [[bone meal]] is used on them.
* Using bone meal on azalea itself creates an [[azalea tree]].
* The variant with pink blossoms is seen as small [[flower]]s by the game (for example, [[bee]]s can pollinate them).

'''[[Azalea Leaves]]'''
* Has variants with either no blossoms or pink blossoms.
* Yield azalea and sticks on decay.
* The variant with pink blossoms is counted as small flowers by the game (for example, bees can pollinate them).

'''[[Block of Amethyst]]'''
* A decorative block found in amethyst geodes.
* Unlike the Budding Amethyst, the Block of Amethyst can be obtained when mined.
* Can also be crafted with 4 amethyst shards.

'''[[Block of Copper]]'''
* Can be crafted with 9 copper ingots, and can also be crafted back into 9 copper ingots.
* Oxidizes and changes texture to a turquoise-green over time.
* Can be stopped from oxidizing by combining it with a honeycomb to create a Waxed Block of Copper.
* [[Honeycomb]] can also be {{Control|used}}, or applied with a [[dispenser]] to wax them.
** Yellow particles are formed when waxing the block.
* [[Axe]]s can be {{Control|used}} to scrape off wax and oxidation (one stage at a time).
** White particles are formed when scraping off wax from the block.
* [[Lightning]] may clean oxidation, reverting the oxidation process by one or several stages.
** Chances of cleaning and number of reverted stages are higher the closer to the struck block.
* Can be crafted into cut copper.
* There are 7 variants in total.

'''[[Block of Mineral#Raw Metal|Block of Raw Metal]]'''
* [[Raw copper]], [[raw gold]] and [[raw iron]] can be crafted into the respective block of raw metal.

'''[[Budding Amethyst]]'''
* Generates amethyst buds/clusters on any side that is exposed either to air or a water source block.
* Cannot be obtained when mined, even with Silk Touch, and does not drop anything.
* Breaks immediately if pushed by a [[piston]] or sticky piston.
** Cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.
* Generates in amethyst geodes.

'''[[Calcite]] '''
* An off-white stone that generates in geodes, between [[smooth basalt]] and [[Block of Amethyst|amethyst]].

'''[[Cave Vines]]'''
* A natural light source, with a [[light]] level of 14.

'''[[Cobbled Deepslate]]'''
* Drops from [[deepslate]] when mined with a pickaxe without [[Silk Touch]].
* Can be used interchangeably with [[cobblestone]] and [[blackstone]] in crafting recipes for basic tools, furnaces and brewing stands.
* Can be crafted into respective stairs, slabs, and walls, [[Polished Deepslate]], [[Chiseled Deepslate]], [[Deepslate Bricks]] and [[Deepslate Tiles]], which can be used to craft their respective stairs, slabs, and walls (excluding Chiseled Deepslate).
** Deepslate Bricks and Deepslate Tiles can also be smelted onto their cracked variants.
* Can be smelted back into deepslate.

'''[[Copper Ore]]'''
* Generates randomly underground in small blobs.
* Copper ore generates uniformly between levels 0 and 64.
* Drops [[raw copper]] when mined.
* Can be smelted into a copper ingot.

'''[[Cut Copper]]'''
* Can be made into stair and slab variants.
* Oxidizes and changes texture over time.
* Can be stopped from oxidizing by combining it with a honeycomb to create Waxed Cut Copper.

* Takes twice as long to mine as normal ores.
* Has the texture of [[deepslate]] replacing the normal stone texture.
* Takes place of ores that generate in deepslate.
* Can be used in blasting and smelting recipes like normal ores.

'''[[Dripleaf]]'''
* Allows an entity to stay on it for 1.5 seconds (30 ticks) before the entity falls through it.
** The tilt happens in 3 stages: Unstable, Partial, and Full.
*** All the stages are solid except the Full stage, which is when the player falls through.
*** When nobody is standing on it, it is set to the 'none' stage.
** The tilt can also be triggered by hitting the plant with a projectile.
** The tilt can be prevented by powering it with [[redstone]], but hitting it with a projectile still causes it to tilt.
* Comes in two sizes: small and big. Small can be applied [[bone meal]] to grow into big.
** Small dripleaf can be obtained only with [[shears]] (otherwise breaks) and can be planted on [[clay]] or [[moss block]]s, or underwater on clay and dirt blocks.
** Big dripleaf can be obtained with any tool or by hand and can be planted on grass, dirt, and moss blocks.

'''[[Dripstone Block]]'''
* A decoration block.
* Appears to be made of the same materials as stalactites and stalagmites but as a full cube.
* [[Dripstone cluster]]s can be found rarely in regular caves.
* Can be crafted from 4 [[pointed dripstone]].

'''[[Glow Item Frame]]'''
* Placeable entities that appear to glow.
* Do not affect the light level, but appear as if lit up themselves.
* Items placed inside also glow.
* Crafted using an [[item frame]] and a glow ink sac.
* Includes application to [[map]]s.

'''[[Glow Lichen]]'''
* A naturally occurring light source found rarely in caves, growing on any face of a block.
* Has a light level of 7.
* Obtained with [[shears]], otherwise breaks.
* Does not spread naturally, although [[bone meal]] can be used to spread it horizontally (or vertically if on the side of a block).
** It spreads to adjacent spaces, up to 4.
* Can be waterlogged.
* Unlike [[vines]], it does not pop off when underwater, and is not climbable.

'''[[Hanging Roots]]'''
* Decorative blocks that can be placed only on the underside of a block.
* Obtained with shears, otherwise breaks.
* Can be obtained using a [[hoe]] on [[rooted dirt]] turning it into normal [[dirt]].

'''[[Infested Deepslate]]'''
* An infested variant of deepslate.
* Spawn a [[silverfish]] when mined.

'''[[Lightning Rod]]'''
* Can be crafted with 3 copper ingots.
* [[Lightning]] strikes within a 64-block radius get redirected to the lightning rod.
* Gives off a redstone signal with a strength of 15 if hit by lightning.
* Can be activated directly by throwing a trident with [[Channeling]] at it during a [[thunderstorm]].

'''[[Moss Block]]'''
* An opaque block with a grass-like texture on all sides.
* Can be fertilized with bone meal to grow [[grass]], [[tall grass]], moss carpets, and both types of azaleas on it and in its vicinity.
* Can be fertilized with bone meal to grow over (expand) across stone surfaces, but not grass surfaces. 
* Can be combined with [[cobblestone]] or [[stone bricks]] to make the mossy versions of those blocks.
** [[Vines]] can still be used, in addition to moss blocks.

'''[[Moss Carpet]]'''
* Same texture as the moss block, but one pixel thick.
* Can be crafted with moss blocks, or be obtained by applying bone meal to them.

'''[[Pointed Dripstone]]'''
* Can be either placed on a ceiling to create a stalactite or on top of a block to create a stalagmite.	
** Can be combined to form longer stalactites and stalagmites.	
* Thrown [[trident]]s break pointed dripstone. They also break when pushed directly or with a block by a [[piston]].	
* Stalagmites break if not attached to something below. 
* Stalagmites hurt [[entity|entities]] that fall on top of them more than normal fall damage.
** Damage is relative to height: For example, jumping on a stalagmite deals {{hp|2}} of damage, and falling from 3 blocks deals {{hp|8}} of damage.
* Stalactites can fall or break if unsupported, and break apart on impact, hurting entities they fall on.
** Damage is relative to height: For example, one falling from 2 blocks deals {{hp|2}} of damage, and one falling from 3 blocks deal {{hp|4}} of damage.
** They drip [[water]] or [[lava]] into [[cauldron]]s if a source block is placed above the stalactite, and gradually fill the cauldron. Water drips even without any water above the block (as does lava in [[the Nether]]) but this effect alone does not fill the cauldron.

'''[[Powder Snow]]'''
* A variant of snow, entities that walk over it sink into it.
* [[Leather boots]] can be worn to prevent entities from sinking into powder snow blocks.<!--Tested, works with anything that can have armor items, including mobs that normally don't wear armor, like cows.-->
** [[Player]]s can still [[crouch]] to descend with leather boots. Wearing leather boots also allows powder snow to be "climbed", like water or [[scaffolding]]. They also prevent fall damage when landing on powder snow.
** [[Leather Horse Armor]] also protects [[horse]]s from freeze damage.
* When inside a powder snow block, a frosty vignette appears around the player's screen and any entity (with the exception of [[stray]]s, [[polar bear]]s, and [[snow golem]]s) inside starts freezing and taking damage after a short time.
** Wearing any piece of [[leather armor]] stops the freeze effect.
* Can be collected and placed with a [[bucket]]. {{ItemSprite|Powder Snow Bucket}}
* Entities on fire melt powder snow when colliding.

'''[[Rooted Dirt]]'''
* A dirt-like decorative block with roots on its texture.
* Similar to [[coarse dirt]], neither [[mycelium]] nor [[grass]] spread to it.
* Using [[bone meal]] on any side grows [[hanging roots]] underneath.

'''[[Smooth Basalt]]'''
* A [[basalt]] variant that composes the outer layer of amethyst geodes.
* Can be obtained by smelting basalt.

'''[[Spore Blossom]]'''
* Can be placed only on the underside of a block.
* Sends green particles downward when opened.
* Particles appear in the air around the block.

'''[[Tinted Glass]]'''
* A black variant of glass that is transparent to players, but does not let light through.
* Can be crafted with 4 amethyst shards and a glass block.
** Stained glass cannot be used to craft tinted glass.
* Drops itself if mined without [[Silk Touch]] or even by hand, unlike [[glass]].

'''[[Tuff]]'''
* A deep grayish stone that generates in blobs between levels 0 and 16.

=== Items ===

* Can be smelted into [[iron ingot]]s.

'''[[Spawn Egg]]s'''
* Added [[Axolotl]] spawn egg.
* Added [[Goat]] spawn egg.
* Added [[Glow Squid]] spawn egg.

'''[[Spyglass]]'''
* Crafted with 2 copper ingots and an amethyst shard.
* When used, it zooms in on wherever the player is looking but limits their view to a square.
** The scope [[texture]] is a [[glass]] square with a [[copper]] border.
** The overlay that limits the view can be removed with a [[resource pack]].
* There is a unique animation for using the spyglass, which is visible in a third-person perspective or by another player.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Axolotl]]'''
* Can spawn in underground [[water]] sources.
* The first amphibian added to Minecraft.
** Dry out and start taking damage after 5 minutes of being out of water.
* Can be caught using a [[water bucket]], like [[fish]].
* Can be bred using [[bucket of fish|buckets of tropical fish]].
* Come in five different colors (leucistic, yellow, brown, white, and blue, with blue being the rarest).
** Blue axolotls are rare, with a {{frac|1|1200}} chance of spawning.
* Plays dead when damaged on water, receiving [[Regeneration]] I.
** This regeneration ability is likely based on how real axolotls can regrow lost limbs.
* Attacks [[drowned]], [[guardian]]s, [[elder guardian]]s, [[squid]]s, [[glow squid]]s and fish, dealing {{hp|2}} damage.
** They have a two-minute cooldown after hunting non-hostile targets such as fish and squids.
** They prioritize attacking hostile mobs over passive ones.
* If a player kills a mob an axolotl is in combat with, the player gets a Regeneration I effect and is rid of [[Mining Fatigue]], if they had it.

'''[[Goat]]'''

* Underwater mob that behaves like a regular [[squid]]. 
* Can spawn in underground water sources.
* Is attacked by [[axolotl]]s without provocation.
* Drops glow ink sacs when killed.
* Does not affect the light level, but appears as if lit up. Glows in the same way that [[magma cube]] cores, [[vex]]es, [[blaze]]s and the eyes of [[spider]]s, [[drowned]], and [[endermen]] do.
* Stops glowing for a short time and swims away quickly after taking damage.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Amethyst Geode]]s'''
* A new feature found uncommonly underground (can rarely appear exposed to the surface close to sea level).
* Contains blocks of amethyst and budding amethyst blocks, which are encased in a shell of calcite and smooth basalt.
** Also generates with a small nearby air pocket nearby that may open into the geode.
* Most commonly generates at lower levels (y = 6 to y = 47)
* Overrides standard caves and ravines, but is overridden by mineshafts.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Gamerule]]s'''
* <code>freezeDamage</code>
** Whether entities take damage from freezing inside of [[powder snow]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Achievements]]'''
* Added 3 new achievements:
** ''Wax On Wax Off'' - Apply and remove Wax from all the Copper blocks (30G)
** ''Float Your Goat'' - Get in a boat and float with a Goat (20G)
** ''The Healing Power of Friendship'' - Team up with an Axolotl and win a fight (30G)

'''[[Death message]]s'''
* Added 3 new death messages:
**"<player> froze to death"
**"<player> was skewered by a falling stalactite"
**"<player> was impaled on a stalagmite"

=== Technical ===
'''General '''
* Added two new variables to the 'biomes_client.json' file: "remove_all_prior_fog" and "inherit_from_prior_fog", which control fog merging and/or inheritance.
* "remove_all_prior_fog", when true, clears all previous fog definitions stored on the stack, making the current pack the new "starting point" for fogs.
* "inherit_from_prior_fog", when true, merges a biome's fog definition with matching biomes on the stack then create a new merged definition for it.
* "transparentattachable" tag should affect rendering only in first person camera perspective.

'''Actors '''
* Catmull-Rom animations no longer glitch if the time for a keyframe matches its value.
* All functions run using the {{cmd|schedule}} command now run from the origin they are supposed to, instead of from the server.
* Added a new field "transform_to_item" to the "minecraft:ageable" component. If the field is filled with an item name, the item is given back when any of "feed_items" are used. Similar to "transform_to_item" in the "minecraft:breedable" component.
* Added a new optional flag "use_simplified_breeding" to "minecraft:genetics" component. When this flag is set to true, the offspring never inherits hidden alleles of parents as main alleles and main as hidden. This makes simple breeding logic easier.

=== Experimental ===
These features are locked behind the experimental toggle, which can be accessed by enabling "Upcoming Creator Features" and "Enable GameTest Framework".

'''GameTest Framework'''

'''Volume Driven Fog'''
* Create volumes in your world: simply create a "volumes" folder in a saved world and put JSON files in there - one JSON file per volume.
* Can be enabled using the "Upcoming Creator Features" experimental feature toggle.
* Currently, you can attach a fog - Minecraft or your own custom fog - to a volume. When the player enters the volume, the fog takes effect.
* Added AddVolumeEntityPacket that contains information about a volume entity including its net ID and NBT containing information about the volume's definition and components, which is added to the client's registry.
