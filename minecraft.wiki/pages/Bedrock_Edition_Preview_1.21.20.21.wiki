=== Technical ===
'''AI Goals'''
*Exposed {{cd|minecraft:behavior.swim_up_for_breath}} AI goal component which allows a mob to try to move to a location where it can breathe air once it is close to running out of its breathable supply. 
** In Vanilla, this is used by the Dolphin. Any custom content built off of the Vanilla dolphin at or above version 1.21.20 will need to manually add this component to enable this AI behavior.

'''[[API]]'''
*{{cd|EntityLeashableComponent}}
**Moved class {{cd|EntityLeashableComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.13.0}}.

'''General'''
*Updated schema documentation for Filter Groups.

'''Graphical'''
*2 Channel textures in resource packs are now properly supported. When loaded they will always use the first channel to represent all three color channels and the second channel for alpha (I.E A normal texture would be (R, G, B, A) where a 2 channel texture will always be treated as (R, R, R, A)).

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle.
=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[API]]'''
*{{cd|EntityBreathableComponent}}
**Changed function {{cd|setAirSupply(value: number): void}} to property {{cd|airSupply: number}} in {{cd|beta}}.
**Added property {{cd|readonly}} {{cd|canBreathe: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}.
*Added {{cd|isHardcore}} to {{cd|1.14.0}} {{cd|beta}}.

'''[[Blocks]]'''
*Added {{cd|item_display_transforms}} control to the block geometry file. This controls the way a block is visually represented in the UI, on the player, and floating on the ground. It exists inside {{cd|minecraft:geometry}}, and requires {{cd|format_version}} {{cd|1.21.20}}.
**Default values example:
<pre>"item_display_transforms": {
"gui" : {
                "translation": [0, 0, 0],
                "rotation": [30, 225, 0],
                "scale": [0.625, 0.625, 0.625]

'''Other'''
*Texture overrides that intended to target all block variants no longer only override the default variant.
*Area Effect Clouds no longer shrink when entered by entities immune to the effect.
*Fixed a recipe bug where {{cd|chiseled_sandstone}} and {{cd|cut_sandstone}} sandstone variants could be used in a furnace to craft {{cd|smooth_sandstone}}. It can now only accept normal {{cd|sandstone}} and no other types of sandstone.
*Fixed Vanilla recipes involving {{cd|red_sandstone_slab}} as an ingredient or result item, they would incorrectly use {{cd|red_sandstone}} instead:
**{{cd|red_sandstone_slab}} can now be crafted again with 3 horizontal {{cd|red_sandstone:0}}.
**{{cd|red_sandstone_slab}} can now be crafted again with 3 horizontal {{cd|red_sandstone:1}}.
**{{cd|red_sandstone:1}} can now be crafted again with 2 vertical {{cd|red_sandstone_slab}}.
*Fixed a bug where the Breeze could get stuck in one place when beneath a roof of blocks while attacking.
*Wind Charges thrown by Players no longer have a chance of dealing more than 1 damage per hit.
*Jumping no longer overrides any previous greater upward velocity, and therefore doesn't cancel momentum from a Wind Burst explosion when both happen at the same time.
*Using Trident with Riptide enchantment now correctly cancels fall damage reduction from Wind Charge.
*Fixed a bug where the fall damage protection from a Wind Charge incorrectly prevented fall damage when landing a second time.
*Players are no longer kicked from the Realm if the owner enters and exits the Realms Settings screen without modifying packs while multiple Add-Ons are applied.
*Navigating away from the Realms Stories Story Feed tab upon reading the first page of stories will remove the unread stories badge as the user has seen the most recent posts.
*Fixed a bug where brand new Realm Events wouldn't display properly the first time the Story Feed is opened.
*Fixed a bug that locks players on an infinite loop after cancelling the process of joining a recently claimed Preview Realm.
*Fixed a bug where culling rules for data driven blocks did not rotate with the transformation component.
*Fixed a bug where certain objects from the world would be visible through the gamma calibration menu in the Deferred Technical Preview.</onlyinclude>
