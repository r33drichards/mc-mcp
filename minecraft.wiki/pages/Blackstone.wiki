'''Blackstone''' is a dark-colored [[block]] that functions similar to [[cobblestone]] or [[cobbled deepslate]]. It can be found only in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{breaking row|Blackstone|Pickaxe|Wood|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Blackstone generates naturally in [[the Nether]], particularly in the [[basalt deltas]] biome, below the surface of a [[lava sea]], and anywhere underground.

Blackstone can be found as a part of [[bastion remnant]]s.

[[Ore (feature)|Ore blob]]s of blackstone attempt to replace [[netherrack]] 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0 to 160, from [[altitude|levels]] 5 to 31{{only|java|short=1}}/36{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, in all Nether biomes except [[basalt deltas]].

{{IN|Java}}, blackstones also generate in big [[blobs]], which attempt to replace [[netherrack]] 25 times per chunk in blobs of radius 3—7, from [[Altitude|Y-level]]s 0 to 127, in the [[basalt deltas]] biome.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s may [[barter]] 8-16 blocks of blackstone with a chance of ~8.53% ({{frac|40|469}}) when given a [[gold ingot]].

== Usage ==
Blackstone can be used as a substitute for [[cobblestone]] in [[the Nether]] as it can be used to craft stone [[tool]]s, [[brewing stand]]s, and [[furnace]]s. It can also be used to repair stone tools using an [[anvil]]. It can also be used to craft [[polished blackstone]].

Blackstone cannot be used to craft [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, [[piston]]s, or other [[block]]s that use cobblestone in their recipes.<ref>{{bug|MC-177904|||WAI}}</ref>
