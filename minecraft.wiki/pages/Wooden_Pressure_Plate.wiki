A '''wooden pressure plate''' is a wooden variant of the [[pressure plate]]. It can detect all entities, producing the maximum signal strength of 15. Wooden pressure plates come in all variants of wood.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A wooden pressure plate can be mined using any tool, or without a tool, and drops itself as an item. However, [[axe]]s are the fastest way to break one.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1
|Wooden Pressure Plate
|sprite=wooden-pressure-plates
|Axe
|Any
|link=none}}

A pressure plate is removed and drops itself as an item if:

* the block beneath it is moved, removed, or destroyed
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space

=== Natural generation ===
Oak pressure plates can generate in some [[plains]] village houses and in [[trial chambers]] (some [[dispenser]] traps and a hidden chamber in the "Intersection 2" room).

Acacia pressure plates can generate in some [[savanna]] [[village]] houses.

Spruce pressure plates can generate in some [[snowy tundra]], [[taiga]], and [[snowy taiga]] [[village]] houses.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A2= Matching Planks
|B2= Matching Planks
|Output= Matching Wooden Pressure Plate
|type= Redstone
}}

== Usage ==
=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A pressure plate can be used to detect entities on top of it (players, mobs, items, etc.).

==== Placement ====
[[File:Pressure plate as power source.png|thumb|Pressure plate placement and behavior.]]
[[File:Pressure plate.png|thumb|Pressure plates on fences.]]

To place a pressure plate, {{control|use}} it while aiming at the face of a block adjacent to the destination space.

A pressure plate can be attached to:
* the '''top''' of any full solid [[opaque]] block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components ([[command block]]s, [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, [[note block]]s, and [[redstone lamp]]s)
* the '''top''' of a [[hopper]], [[fence]], [[nether brick fence]], an upside-down [[slab]], or upside-down [[stairs]].

A pressure plate cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the plate to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a plate to the ''side'' of the fence causes the plate to be attached to the ''top'' of the ground next to the fence instead.

More information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

==== Activation ====
A pressure plate ''activates'' when an entity is on top of it (specifically, when the entity's collision mask intersects the bottom quarter-block of the pressure plate's space, which may include entities flying close to the ground), with a minimum activation time of {{convert|1|second|tick}}.

A wooden pressure plate is activated by all entities (including players, mobs, items, arrows, experience orbs, fishing bobs, etc.) besides snowballs.

Once activated, a pressure plate checks if entities are still present at regular intervals. Wooden pressure plates check every {{convert|10|redstone tick|second}}, starting 10 redstone ticks after activation, so they deactivate up to 10 redstone ticks after no entities are on top of them.

A [[minecart]] traveling on [[rail]]s activates a pressure plate next to a diagonal track but not one next to a straight track.

==== Behavior ====
While active, a pressure plate:
* powers adjacent '''[[redstone dust]]''', and adjacent '''[[redstone comparator]]s''' or '''[[redstone repeater]]s''' facing away from the plate
* strongly powers any full solid opaque '''block''' beneath it
* activates adjacent '''[[mechanism component]]s''', including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.

The [[Redstone circuit#Power level|power level]] is always 15.

[[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around a pressure plate without affecting it.

A pressure plate is not solid (it is not a barrier to entity movement). A block under a pressure plate can provide a solid barrier underneath it (for mobs to walk across, items to fall on, etc.), but when a pressure plate is placed on a block with a small collision mask, such as a fence or nether brick fence, it is possible for entities to move through the pressure plate while still activating it (walking through it horizontally, or falling through it vertically). Thus, a pressure plate on a fence can be used to detect entities without stopping them (more compactly than a tripwire circuit).

Pressure plates are 0.0625 blocks high ({{frac|1|16}} of a block) when inactive and 0.03125 blocks high ({{frac|1|32}} of a block) when active, but because they are not solid they do not affect the position of entities "on top" of them, so a player on top of a pressure plate is actually standing on the block beneath it.

Pressure plates can also open [[doors]], activate [[TNT]], and power [[command block]]s.
{{-}}

=== Fuel ===
Overworld wooden pressure plates can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per pressure plate. Nether wood pressure plates (crimson and warped), cannot be used as fuel in a furnace.

=== Note blocks ===
Wooden pressure plates can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
