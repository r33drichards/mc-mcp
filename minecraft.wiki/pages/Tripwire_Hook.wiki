A '''tripwire hook''' is a [[block]] used to create a tripwire circuit, which requires two hooks and a straight horizontal line of 1-40 [[string]]. Both hooks in a valid circuit emit a [[Redstone Dust|redstone signal]] and power their attached blocks while any of the string is being touched by an [[entity]], or if any string is broken without using [[shears]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Tripwire hooks can be broken instantly using any tool, or without a tool.

A tripwire hook is also removed and drops itself as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
* [[water]] flows into its space {{in|java}}
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space

A tripwire hook is destroyed without dropping itself as an item if [[lava]] flows into its space.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|B1= Iron Ingot
|B2= Stick
|B3= Any Planks
|Output= Tripwire Hook,2
|type= Redstone
}}

=== Natural generation ===
Four tripwire hooks are generated naturally in each [[jungle pyramid]]. Several tripwire hooks can generate inside [[trial chamber]]s next to [[dispensers]] as traps.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|tripwire-hook}}

=== Fishing ===
Tripwire hooks can be obtained as a "junk" item from [[fishing]].

== Usage ==
Tripwire hooks can be used as crafting ingredients or as [[redstone circuit]] components.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A tripwire hook can be used to detect mobs, items, and other [[entities]] over a large area.

; Placement

: To place a tripwire hook, use the {{control|Place Block}} [[control]].

: In order to function correctly, a tripwire hook must be part of a "tripwire circuit": a ''straight'' line of blocks consisting of a block with a tripwire hook attached to it, a "tripwire line" (1 to 40 blocks of [[tripwire]]), and a second tripwire hook attached to another block, with both tripwire hooks facing the tripwire.

: To place tripwire, use the {{control|Place Block}} [[control]] with a [[string]]. Tripwire in a valid tripwire circuit has a short hitbox (0.09375 or 3/32 blocks high, with the bottom 0.0625 or 1/16 blocks above the block below), while tripwire not in a valid tripwire circuit has a taller hitbox (0.5 blocks high, bottom not raised).

: A tripwire hook in an invalid tripwire circuit appears "folded", while a tripwire hook in a valid tripwire circuit appears extended straight. Tripwire lines from separate tripwire circuits can be placed next to each other (in parallel), above each other, and even intersecting each other.

;Activation

: A tripwire hook in a valid tripwire circuit activates when certain [[entities]] (players, mobs, items, etc.) intersect the tripwire hook's tripwire line "hitbox" (but ''not'' the tripwire hook itself), and deactivates when all entities leave or are removed from the tripwire line.

: Entities that cannot activate a tripwire circuit include area effect clouds and players in [[spectator mode]]. {{IN|JE}}, thrown eyes of ender, the ender dragon, markers, and items clipped into solid blocks do not activate a tripwire circuit.

: A tripwire hook also activates for 5 redstone ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag) when any of its tripwires are destroyed, except when [[shears]] are used to destroy the tripwire.

: Breaking the tripwire hook, or breaking the block it is attached to does not generate a pulse.

;Behavior
[[File:Tripwire hook as power source.png|thumb|The tripwire hooks and the blocks they are attached to provide power, but the tripwire does not.]]

: While active, a tripwire hook appears to move downward and it:
:* powers any adjacent [[redstone dust]] to [[Redstone circuit#Power|power level]] 15, including beneath the tripwire hook
:* powers any adjacent [[redstone comparator]]s or [[redstone repeater]]s facing away from the tripwire hook to power level 15
:* strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15
:* activates any adjacent [[mechanism component]]s, including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.

: Tripwire produces no power itself, but its state change can be detected with an [[observer]].

: Although destroying tripwire with shears cannot activate a tripwire hook, it changes the tripwire hook's block state (its "attached" state from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>), which can be detected with an observer.
