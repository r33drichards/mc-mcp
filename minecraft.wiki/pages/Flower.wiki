=== Other flowers ===
<!-- non-tall or short flower blocks with the #minecraft:flowers tag -->
{{In|java}} the following blocks are also part of the <code>minecraft:flowers</code> block [[tag]]. These blocks are substantially different from small and tall flowers. As a result, only some of the information presented in this overview page applies to them, such as their usage in bee-related features.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A flower can be broken instantly with any [[item]] or by hand, dropping itself. A flower also breaks if [[water]] runs over its location, or if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a [[block]] into its location.

=== Natural generation ===
{{See also|Vegetation}}

Most flowers generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s as part of [[vegetation]] features in most [[biome]]s. Flowers can generate even if the biome is covered with [[snow]]. The tables in {{section link||Flower biomes}} show the types of small flowers that can naturally spawn in each biome when a new [[chunk]] is generated, as well as the flowers that can spawn when [[bone meal]] is used on grass blocks.

[[Sunflower]]s generate in [[sunflower plains]]; [[lilac]]s, [[rose bush]]es, and [[peonies]] can be found in [[forest]]s, [[flower forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[old growth birch forest]]s, and [[dark forest]]s.

[[Wither rose]]s, [[torchflower]]s, and [[pitcher plant]]s do not generate naturally at all.

Natural dandelions are found in [[plains]] and [[savanna]] [[village]]s; poppies in plains, savanna, [[taiga]], and [[snowy plains]]{{only|be|short=1}} villages; and oxeye daisies, cornflowers, and azure bluets in plains villages. Potted dandelions, poppies, blue orchids, alliums, azure bluets, red and white tulips, and oxeye daisies can be found in [[woodland mansion]]s.

Flowers (and [[grass]]) can be found on [[dirt path]]s at [[villages]], where the player cannot place them.

{{Block distribution|Allium|Azure Bluet|Blue Orchid|Cornflower|Dandelion|Eyeblossom|Lily of the Valley|Oxeye Daisy|Poppy|Torchflower|Tulip|Lilac|Peony|Pitcher Plant|Sunflower}}

=== Flower biomes ===
Flowers marked "Natural generation only" can only spawn when the chunk is initially generated, ''not'' when using bone meal; flowers marked "Bone meal only" cannot generate naturally, but can be created by players using bone meal on a grass block in that biome ({{section link||Post-generation}} for more details).

Dandelions and poppies in [[jungle]]s, [[bamboo jungle]]s, [[sparse jungle]]s, [[savanna]]s, and [[savanna plateau]]s (but not [[windswept savanna]]) are twice as common as in other biomes.

Some biomes - such as deserts - are technically enabled to generate vegetation features containing flowers, but do not generate dirt or grass blocks on the surface in regular worlds. This means that flowers are normally not generated in these biomes in regular worlds. Flowers can still be grown in these biomes by using bone meal on grass blocks, and they can generate naturally if a dirt or grass block surface is provided in [[Superflat#Customization|custom superflats]] or [[custom world]]s.

{{notelist}}

=== Flower gradients ===
In some biomes, the placement of flowers is determined by gradients. These are not affected by the [[world seed]]. {{IN|java}}, gradients are three dimensional and change on the Y level, while {{in|bedrock}} they are consistent at every height.

==== Flower forests ====
In a [[flower forest]], any given coordinate can spawn only one type of flower, resulting in a gradient (pictured below). The gradient runs as follows:

* {{blockLink|Dandelion}}
* {{blockLink|Poppy}}
* {{blockLink|Allium}}
* {{blockLink|Azure bluet}}
* {{blockLink|Red tulip}}
* {{blockLink|Orange tulip}}
* {{blockLink|White tulip}}
* {{blockLink|Pink tulip}}
* {{blockLink|Oxeye daisy}}
* {{blockLink|Cornflower}}
* {{blockLink|Lily of the valley}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, additional randomness is applied during terrain generation, meaning that some flowers might not perfectly align to the gradient.

[[Peonies]], [[lilac]]s, and [[rose bush]]es generate independently from the gradient. {{IN|java}}, additional patches of lily of the valley are generated by a separate flower feature that does not follow the gradient and that cannot be regrown using bone meal.<ref>{{bug|MC-241620||Lily of the valley generation with bone meal in flower forests is extremely scarce}}</ref>

<gallery>

Flower forest gradient Bedrock.png|alt=Screenshot of the flower gradient of flower forests in Bedrock Edition|Flower forest gradient {{in|bedrock}}
Flower forest gradient elevation change.gif|An example of how elevation affects the flower forest gradient in ''Java Edition''
</gallery>

==== Meadows ====
In [[meadow]]s, up to 3 gradients intersect and overlap to create complex patterns. Like in flower forests, any given coordinate can spawn only one type of flower. {{IN|java}}, the individual gradients run as follows:

* {{BlockLink|Tall grass}}
* {{BlockLink|Allium}}
* {{BlockLink|Poppy}}
* {{BlockLink|Azure bluet}}
* {{BlockLink|Dandelion}}
* {{BlockLink|Cornflower}}
* {{BlockLink|Oxeye daisy}}
* {{BlockLink|Short grass}}

Using bone meal in areas of the gradient where ''only'' tall grass or short grass generates does not create any flower.

{{IN|bedrock}}, the gradients only affect naturally generated vegetation; bone meal completely ignores the gradients and only generates dandelions. The individual gradients run as follows:
* {{BlockLink|Allium}}
* {{BlockLink|Poppy}}
* {{BlockLink|Cornflower}}
* {{BlockLink|Oxeye daisy}}
* {{BlockLink|Azure bluet}}
* {{BlockLink|Dandelion}}
* {{BlockLink|Short grass}}
* Nothing<!--x 2082 y 965 in a meadow biome (e.g. seed -6858972503710229081), 3 gradients intersect generating 1) dandelions, 2) poppies, 3) nothing.-->

<gallery>
MeadowGradient.png|alt=Screenshot of the flower gradient of meadows|Meadow flower gradient
</gallery>

==== Plains ====
[[Plains]] and [[sunflower plains]] use a simpler gradient that allows tulips to generate only in rare areas where no other kinds of flower can spawn. Flower types are otherwise selected randomly: dandelions, poppies, azure bluets, oxeye daisies, and cornflowers outside the tulip areas (with dandelions being more common than the others), and any type of tulip inside the tulip areas. [[Sunflower]]s in sunflower plains generate independently from the gradient.

{{IN|java}}, this pattern is also applied to [[dripstone caves]] and the [[deep dark]], although flowers do not naturally generate there.

<gallery>

Tulips in dripstone cave.png|Tulips grown using bone meal in a dripstone cave {{in|java}}
Tulips in deep dark.png|Tulips grown using bone meal in a deep dark biome {{in|java}}
</gallery>

=== Post-generation ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Flower farming}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]], flowers have a chance of generating instead of [[short grass]] on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area {{in|java}}, or a 7×5×7 area {{in|bedrock}}. In most biomes, the generated flower is picked randomly among all possible choices depending on the [[biome]] (see {{section link||Flower biomes}} for a chart of flowers that can be grown in each biome). In a few biomes, however, a [[#Flower gradients|gradient]] is applied and the generated flower additionally depends on the X/Y/Z coordinates.

Double flowers, wither roses, and torchflowers cannot be obtained this way.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, when bone meal is applied to a small flower (except wither rose and torchflower), more flowers appear on adjacent grass blocks without generating any short grass. With the exception of dandelions and poppies, the flowers that form around are the same type as the original flower. In the case of dandelions, poppies occasionally appear, and vice versa for poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

Applying bone meal to a double flower (except pitcher plants) causes the flower to drop a copy of itself. This is the only renewable way to obtain double flowers.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Endermen]] can pick up any small flower {{in|java}}, or only dandelions and poppies {{in|bedrock}}; the flower is [[drop]]ped if the enderman is killed while holding it.

Iron golems drop 0–2 {{BlockLink|Poppy|poppies}} on death.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may [[Trading#Wandering trader sales|sell]] 1 of most small flowers for a single emerald. They cannot sell [[wither rose]]s, [[torchflower]]s, [[closed eyeblossom]]s, or any tall flowers.
{{Trade sources|Allium|Azure Bluet|Blue Orchid|Cornflower|Dandelion|Closed Eyeblossom|Open Eyeblossom|Lily of the Valley|Oxeye Daisy|Poppy|Orange Tulip|Pink Tulip|Red Tulip|White Tulip|Lilac|Peony|Sunflower|Rose Bush|Wither Rose|Torchflower|Pitcher Plant|Cherry Leaves|Chorus Flower|Flowering Azalea|Flowering Azalea Leaves|Mangrove Propagule|Pink Petals|Spore Blossom|Wildflowers|Cactus Flower}}

== Usage ==
[[File:FlowerPlaceBlock.png|thumb|All of the blocks that flowers can be placed on. Dandelions represent small flowers, rose bushes represent large flowers, and wither roses represent additional blocks they can be placed on.]]

All kinds of flowers can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[pale moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Wither roses can also be planted on [[netherrack]] or [[soul sand]]. {{IN|java}}, wither roses can also be planted on [[soul soil]]. One-block-tall flowers can be planted in a [[flower pot]].

All flowers can be crafted into [[dye]]s, and all small flowers can be used to craft [[suspicious stew]].

Because flowers are non-solid transparent [[block]]s, they can be used (like [[torch]]es) to break blocks that fall on them, such as [[sand]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Dandelion, Poppy, Blue Orchid, Allium, Azure Bluet, Red Tulip, Pink Tulip, Orange Tulip, White Tulip, Oxeye Daisy, Sunflower, Lilac, Rose Bush, Peony, Wither Rose, Cornflower, Lily of the Valley, Torchflower, Pitcher Plant, Closed Eyeblossom, Open Eyeblossom, Wildflowers, Cactus Flower}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{main|Suspicious Stew}}
All small flowers can be used to create [[suspicious stew]]. When a flower is {{control|used}} on a brown [[mooshroom]], the brown mooshroom produces a suspicious stew related to that flower the next time it is milked with a [[bowl]]. The mooshroom returns to producing regular mushroom stew until fed another flower. Eating one bowl of suspicious stew restores {{hunger|6}} [[hunger]] and 7.2 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]], as well as producing a brief status effect.
{{Crafting
|ignoreusage=1
|Red Mushroom
|Brown Mushroom
|Bowl
|Any Small Flower
|Output=Suspicious Stew
|shapeless=true
}}

Using different flowers results in different effects. All are short-lived, but some have lasting effects: Regeneration restores {{hp|2}} health, Poison inflicts up to {{hp|8}} damage, and Wither inflicts up to {{hp|3}} damage. The Saturation effect makes those stews a superfood: they restore up to 6 hunger and 12 saturation points on top of their food value, for a total of {{hunger|12}} and over 19 points of saturation.
{{:Suspicious Stew/Effects}}

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with flowers. Bees will collect nectar from nearby flowers and bring it back to their hive, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1. Certain plants will have their growth advanced if a bee carrying nectar flies overhead, "pollenating" the plant. Bees attempt to collect nectar from wither roses, although they get damaged in the process if the difficulty is higher than [[Peaceful]].<ref>{{bug|MC-159396||Bees target wither roses and die|WAI}}</ref> Bees also get inflicted with [[Poison]] when they touch an [[open eyeblossom]] and the difficulty is higher than Peaceful. Bees ignore and do not interact with closed eyeblossoms. {{IN|bedrock}}, bees ignore [[snowlogged]] flowers.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-61593||Bees ignore flowers in snow}}</ref>

=== Breeding ===
Dandelions can be used to lead, breed, and grow [[rabbit]]s.

Most flowers can be used to lead, breed, and grow [[bee]]s. Wither roses and open eyeblossoms can be used to lead bees, but feeding a bee with them inflicts the bee with [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] or [[Poison]], respectively. Closed eyeblossoms cannot lead, breed, or grow bees at all.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of any flower have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing any flower (except for the torchflower or a pitcher plant) into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of flowers yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

Placing a torchflower or a pitcher plant into a composter has a 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Trivia == 
<!-- Related bugs are tagged FIXED
* Due to the nature of the flower generation algorithm, it is possible (but relatively rare) to find naturally-generated flowers and grass in [[lava]], [[cavern]]s, or [[mineshaft]]s. Also, it is possible to find flowers and [[wheat seeds]] dropped as an [[item]] on the ground naturally, due to failure to generate on an acceptable [[block]]. -->
* Before they were added to ''[[Minecraft]]'', white flowers were already present in ''[[Minicraft]]''.
