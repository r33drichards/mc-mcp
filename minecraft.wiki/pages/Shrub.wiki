The '''shrub''' is an unused variant of [[short grass]] exclusive to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] that does not generate naturally. It was also present in both ''[[Java Edition|Java]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition|Bedrock]]'' editions, where, in the latter, it used the name '''fern''' and took the appearance of short grass.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|console}}, the shrub can be obtained only through the [[creative menu]]. {{IN|java|bedrock}}, it could be obtained only by using [[commands]] such as {{cmd|give}} or placed in the world using commands such as {{cmd|setblock}}.

=== Breaking ===
When [[Breaking|broken]] normally, shrubs have a {{frac|1|8}} chance of dropping [[wheat seeds]], due to being a type of grass. This drop rate is affected by [[Fortune]] like normal grass as well. Shrubs can be obtained as an item using [[shears]].

== Usage ==
=== Bone meal ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[Bone meal]] can be used on short grass to create [[large fern]].

== Appearance ==
[[File:ShrubConsoleEdition.jpg|thumb|Shrubs placed in an intersection between a taiga, a dark forest and a desert {{in|console}}.]]
{{IN|java}}, the shrub uses the texture of [[dead bush]]es. The only visual difference between the shrub and the dead bush is that the shrub appears randomly off-centered and sunk into the ground, like [[short grass]] and [[fern]]s.

{{IN|bedrock}}, the "fern" uses the texture of [[short grass]].

{{IN|console}}, shrubs appear similar to {{el|java}}, but they change color based on the biome they are placed in, similar to the [[green shrub]].
