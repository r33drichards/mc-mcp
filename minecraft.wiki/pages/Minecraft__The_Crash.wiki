== Synopsis ==
{{q|[[Bianca]] has never been good at following the plan. She’s more of an act-now, deal-with-the-consequences-later kind of person. But consequences can’t be put off forever, as Bianca learns when she and her best friend, Lonnie, are in a terrible car crash.

Waking up in the [[Holy Angels Hospital|hospital]], almost paralyzed by her injuries, Bianca is faced with new questions she’s not equipped to answer. She chooses instead to try a new virtual-reality version of ''Minecraft'' that responds to her every wish, giving her control over a world at the very moment she thought she’d lost it. As she explores this new realm, she encounters a mute, glitching avatar she believes to be [[Lonnie]]. Bianca teams up with [[Esme]] and [[Anton]], two kids who are also playing on the hospital server, to save her friend.

But the road to recovery isn’t without its own dangers. The kids are swarmed by [[Mob|mobs]] seemingly generated by their fears and insecurities, and now Bianca must deal with the uncertainties that have been plaguing her: Is Lonnie really in the game? And can Bianca help him return to reality?|Book description<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.traceybaptiste.com/books/minecraft%3A-the-crash%3A-an-official-minecraft-novel|title=Minecraft: The Crash: An Official Minecraft Novel|website=Tracey Baptiste}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/552068/minecraft-the-crash-by-tracey-baptiste/|title=Minecraft: The Crash|website=Penguin Random House}}</ref>}}
