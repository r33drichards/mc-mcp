'''1.16.2 Pre-release 2''' (known as '''1.16.2-pre2''' in the [[launcher]]) is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.16.2]], released on August 5, 2020,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-16-2-pre-release-2|Minecraft 1.16.2 Pre-Release 2|August 5, 2020}}</ref> which changes the result of inter-dimensional teleporting, allows nether roots to be broken by hand, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Crimson Roots|Crimson]] and [[warped roots]]'''
* Now drop when broken without [[shears]] again.

'''Nether vegetation'''
* No longer catches [[fire]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Pufferfish (item)|Pufferfish]]'''
* Now gives [[Nausea]] I instead of Nausea II when eaten.
** This has no practical effect in-game as the level of the Nausea effect does not change anything.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Badlands]]'''
* Plateaus generate more frequently at the edges of badlands.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* {{cmd|execute in}} now respects dimension scaling for relative and local coordinates: the execution position (only the X/Z part) of a command is divided by 8 when traveling from the Overworld to the Nether, and is multiplied by 8 when vice versa.
** If a value is added after the tilde, that value is added only after the new scaled position is calculated. For instance, <code>~5</code> will first scale the player's current position (multiplying by eight when traveling to the Overworld or dividing by eight when going to the Nether) before adding five to that outputted value.
** For example, if a player at position {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in Overworld runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp ~ ~ ~}}, the player would now be teleported to {{cd|(2,64,2)}} in the Nether.
*** Relatively, if a player at position {{cd|(2,64,2)}} in the Nether runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:overworld run tp ~ ~ ~}}, the player would now be teleported to {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in Overworld.
*** If a player at position {{cd|(80,64,80)}} in Overworld runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp ~ ~ ~5}}, the player would now be teleported to {{cd|(10,64,15)}} in the Nether.
*** If a player at position {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in Overworld runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp 16 64 16}}, the player would still be teleported to {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in the Nether.
** The behavior before this version can be done by running command {{cmd|execute in <target dimension> positioned as @s run tp @s ~ ~ ~}}.
** Applies to [[custom dimension]]s as well.

=== General === 
'''[[Custom dimension]] type'''
* Replaced {{nbt|bool|shrunk}} with {{nbt|float|coordinate_scale}}.
** For example, {{nbt|float|coordinate_scale}} for {{cd|minecraft:overworld}} is 1.0, for {{cd|minecraft:the_nether}} is 8.0, thus the {{cmd|execute in}} command to go to the Overworld actually multiplies the execution position (only the X/Z part) with {{cd|8.0/1.0}} ({{cd|1.0/8.0}} when vice versa), which is 8 (0.125 when vice versa).
** If there are two custom dimension type {{cd|custom:a}} with {{cd|coordinate_scale}} set to 2.33, type {{cd|custom:b}} set to 3.14, then the {{cmd|execute in}} command to go to {{cd|custom:a}} would multiply the execution position (only the X/Z part) with {{cd|3.14/2.33}} ({{cd|2.33/3.14}} when vice versa).
