'''Beta 1.0_01''' is a second version of [[Java Edition Beta]] released on December 20, 2010,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ZFRdEXc8M</ref><ref>{{twon|2390438980|Minor patch 1.0_01. More bugfixes tomorrow.|December 10, 2010}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in [[Java Edition Beta 1.0|Beta 1.0]].

== Fixes ==
'''3 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed double chest bug.
* Fixed rare crash on level load bug.
* Fixed the lighting bug from the chunks that are far away from the player during nighttime.

== Bugs ==
'''1 bug reported'''
* Introduced a bug that could cause framerate drops in singleplayer.

== Trivia ==
* 1.0_01 uses an inconsistent [[version format]] to its surrounding versions. It was succeeded by [[Beta 1.0.2]], not "1.0.1", implying this version was retroactively relabeled "1.0.1" instead of "1.0_01".
