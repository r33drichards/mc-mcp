'''19w45a''' is the twelfth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.15]], released on November 7, 2019.<ref name="19w45a">{{snap|19w45a|November 7, 2019}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>arrows</code> entity tag.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Composter]]s'''
* Now crafted with wooden slabs (like {{in|bedrock}}), instead of fences and wooden planks.

'''[[End stone bricks]]'''
* Now have a [[hardness]] of 3.
* Now have a [[blast resistance]] of 9.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bee]]s'''
* Now search up to 10 blocks away from itself in all directions to find a nest/hive to claim.

'''[[Parrot]]s'''
* No longer imitate endermen.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Tree]]s'''
* Birch trees generate in the [[dark forest]] biome once again.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The advancement "Take Aim" can now be unlocked by damaging an entity with a [[spectral arrow]].

'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* The composter recipe now unlocks with wooden slabs instead of wooden fences.

'''[[Trading]]'''
* [[Librarian]]s now sell one [[bookshelf]] for nine [[emerald]]s, instead of three bookshelves for six emeralds.

=== General ===
'''Textures'''
* [[Shield]] pattern textures now use alpha level for determining what gets the color, instead of the brightness (i.e., textures no longer store transparency as black).
* Changed the unused textures for the [[Java Edition 1.13]] menu panorama to be 1×1 pixels.
* Removed textures for customized world type preset icons, except Isles.
* Grass and foliage [[tint]]s no longer vary within a biome, with the exception of swamps.
