'''Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2''' is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.0.0]], released on September 29, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|119395358135693312|So @notch did the last commit for the 1.9 prerelease 2, get it here: http://assets.minecraft.net/1_9-pre2/minecraft.jar|September 29, 2011}}</ref> which adds [[cauldron]]s, [[glass bottle]]s, [[potion]]s, [[effect]]s, animal [[breeding]] mechanics, 9 more [[music disc]]s, [[Hardcore]] mode, and the ability to clear effects by drinking [[milk]].

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Cauldron JE5.png|32px]] [[Cauldron]]'''
* Present in the code, but not assigned to a [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values|block ID]], making it unobtainable without mods.
* Can be filled with a [[water bucket]] to start brewing. The liquid defaults to a mundane potion with no effects.
* Holds 3 bottles worth of any potion.
* Ingredients can be added to change the potion's effects. Most potions will end up with negative effects, in an attempt to make clean potions harder to brew.<ref name=":0">https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/forum-1-0-update-discussion/947798-potions-and-distillation-1-9-pre4-reference-guide</ref>
* The initial mundane potion appears as water, but once ingredients are added, it uses a tinted lava texture.
* Refilling a potion cauldron with a water bucket will also change its effects.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Blaze Powder JE1.png|32px]] [[Blaze Powder]]'''
* Ingredient for brewing potions.
