=== General ===
'''Protocol'''
* Changed the approach to game client disconnecting on invalid data in packets sent from a server.
** To ease the transition period, modded servers can opt out by setting the appropriate field in the <code>handshake/game_profile</code> packet.
** This option will be removed in the next release.
