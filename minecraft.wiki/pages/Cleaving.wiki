'''Cleaving''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[axe]]s that increases melee damage and lengthens [[shield]] disabling time. It is exclusive to the ''Java Edition'' [[Combat Test]]s.

== Usage ==
Cleaving adds {{hp|1}} + {{hp|1}} × ''level'' <ref group=note>The Cleaving enchantment itself adds 1 damage and each level adds 1 additional damage so level 1 would do 2 damage and level 3 would do 4.</ref> of damage and {{convert|0.5|seconds|ticks}} of [[shield]] stunning per level<ref group="note">Cleaving can disable shields for up to 1.5 seconds longer than the default time, which is 1.6 seconds, for a total of 3.1 seconds.</ref>, for a maximum enchantment level of 3.

=== Damage per hit ===
These tables detail how much [[damage]] is added per level of [[enchantment]], assuming the target is not wearing armor and the attack is fully charged.{{only|java}}

Because Cleaving is exclusive to the ''Java Edition'' [[Combat Test]]s, the attack damages of [[Axe|axes]] in the [[Combat Test]]s are used for the tables.

== Incompatibilities ==
Cleaving is incompatible with [[Sharpness]], [[Smite]], and [[Bane of Arthropods]]. It is also incompatible with [[Impaling]], however in Survival these incompatibilities cannot be encountered, as no weapon types have access to both Cleaving and Impaling. If [[command]]s are used to have two or more of these enchantments on the same item, their effects stack.
