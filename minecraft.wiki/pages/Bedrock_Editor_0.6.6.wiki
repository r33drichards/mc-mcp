'''Bedrock Editor v0.6.6''' is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on June 5, 2024, which tweaks multiple systems.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/180</ref><ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/27211188359949-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-10-22#h_01HZME4T885GXNP632FF6YVG20</ref>

== Changes ==
* Removed Keybinding for {{key|D}} from Paste Preview which blocked movement right. Fixed Distance mode can be selected using the side-panel.
* Expanded the Block Palette Service API to allow management of Block Palettes and Block Palette Items.
* Added radial drag to number input fields, allowing value changes with mouse drag movement.
* Introduced a new script brush manager method {{cd|getBrushVolume}} which, given a set of brush pipeline operations, builds an absolute compound block volume for the brush.

== Fixes ==
* Fixed missing {{key|ctrl+X}} key binding in Editor.
* Fixed bug where small movements in the brush tool caused incorrect cursor tracking.
