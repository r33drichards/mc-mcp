'''Skeletons''' are common [[undead]] type of [[hostile mob]]s that perform ranged attacks with a [[bow]], shooting arrows from a distance. They are most commonly found in the [[Overworld]] at night or in dark locations, but they also occasionally spawn in [[the Nether]] in [[Nether fortress]]es and [[soul sand valley]]s. They are an important source of [[bone]]s and [[arrow]]s, which they drop when killed.

== Spawning ==
Skeletons may spawn in the Overworld in groups of four{{only|JE}} or 1-2{{only|BE}} above [[solid blocks]] at a [[light level]] of 0, except in [[mushroom fields]], [[deep dark]] biomes, and ''naturally'' in [[trial chambers]]. 

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Spider jockeys ===
[[Spider]]s and [[cave spider]]s{{only|be|short=1}} have a 1% chance to spawn with a skeleton riding them, creating a [[spider jockey]].

=== Skeleton horse traps during thunderstorms ===
[[File: SkeletonRiderGroup.png|thumb|A skeleton horse trap.]]
Four skeleton horsemen spawn when a [[Skeleton Horse#Spawning|skeleton horse trap]] is triggered, typically during a thunderstorm. The skeletons ride on skeleton horses and are equipped with enchanted [[bow]]s and [[iron helmet]]s. {{IN|JE}}, they have damage immunity for 3 seconds after spawning.

=== In the Nether ===
Skeletons spawn commonly in [[soul sand valley]] biomes in groups of 4{{Only|Java|short=1}} or 1-2{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}}. However, due to the [[spawn cost]] system. skeletons have a lower population density in soul sand valleys than [[zombified piglin]]s have in [[Nether wastes]] (i.e. there are much fewer skeletons in a given area).

In [[Nether fortress]]es, there is a 20% chance that a skeleton spawns in place of a [[wither skeleton]].

Skeletons in the Nether spawn at the light level of 7 and below.

=== Monster spawners ===
Skeletons spawn from 25% of the [[monster spawner]]s found in [[monster room]]s.

=== Trial spawners ===
Regular skeletons have a {{frac|1|3}} chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].

=== Variants ===
Many skeletons are also replaced by their variants, [[stray]]s in snowy biomes, [[parched]] in desert biomes, [[bogged]] in [[swamp]] and [[mangrove swamp]] biomes, and [[wither skeleton]]s in [[Nether fortress]] structures in [[the Nether]].

== Drops ==

A skeleton always drops any equipment it picked up. A skeleton also has a random chance to drop each piece of naturally spawned equipment, including its [[bow]], if it is killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. The chance to drop a naturally spawned piece of equipment is 8.5% without [[Looting]], 9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III.

Skeletons drop {{xp|5}} experience points when killed by a player or tamed wolf, and an additional {{xp|1|3}} for each piece of naturally spawned equipment, including their bow. The random amount dropped by each piece is independent of the amounts dropped by the other pieces.

== Behavior ==
Skeletons chase [[player]]s, baby [[turtle]]s, and [[iron golem]]s they see within 16 blocks, climbing [[stairs]] or [[ladder]]s, navigating mazes and traversing other complex obstacles to get within shooting range. Despite being associated to [[iron golem]]s, [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s are ignored by skeletons. However, a skeleton can retaliate if a [[firework rocket]] set by a villager hits it.

When within 15 blocks of a target, with a clear line of sight, a skeleton starts shooting [[arrow]]s, once every 3 seconds on Easy and Normal difficulties or once every 2 seconds on Hard difficulty. If the player leaves the 15-block radius, skeletons wait for some seconds with the bow charged, shooting the moment the player comes within range again. Their detection range is reduced by 50% if a [[skeleton skull]] is worn by the player. This stacks with [[sneaking]] and the [[Invisibility]] effect.

[[File:Skeleton loading bow to shoot.png|alt=Skeleton shooting|thumb|right|upright|An idle skeleton and a skeleton shooting.]]

The skeleton's accuracy is based on the world [[difficulty]]. Skeletons have an <code>"error"</code> of <code>10</code> on Easy, <code>6</code> on Normal and <code>2</code> on Hard. This is compared to the player's <code>lack of accuracy</code> of <code>1</code>. To account for gravity, skeletons aim 0.2 blocks higher for every horizontal block of range to the target.

Skeletons have infinite [[durability]] on their bows, and can shoot an infinite amount of arrows. Arrows shot by skeletons cannot be picked up from the ground.

Skeleton behavior varies between the game editions:

;''Java Edition''
* Strafe in circular patterns to dodge attacks and retreat to a safe range if the player comes within 4 blocks. They can walk off cliffs while strafing.<ref>{{bug|MC-90245|||WAI}}</ref>
* [[Sprint]] toward the player if they are 14 blocks away or farther.
* Use bows even underwater. The [[water]] slows down the arrows.
*Animates its bow while attacking.

;''Bedrock Edition''
* Skeletons typically stop moving to shoot, making no attempt to avoid being hit.
* An underwater skeleton uses a melee attack because it is unable to use a [[bow]] underwater.
* A skeleton on land shoots quickly at a player in water. The rate of fire increases as the player approaches, making [[combat]] difficult due to the knockback.
* Skeletons shoot faster at players the more they are closer to it. The rate of fire decreases from 3 seconds to 1 second the closer the player is.

In most cases, if a skeleton's arrow hits a neutral or hostile [[mob]] that has not yet been attacked by the player, the mob attacks the skeleton. When a skeleton is attacked by another mob (including another skeleton), it attacks that mob, reorienting on the player once the mob is dead. Skeletons flee from [[wolves]]. A skeleton runs from a chasing wolf until the wolf deals damage, after which the skeleton turns to shoot at the wolf that successfully attacked it.
[[File:skeletonduel.png|thumb|Dueling skeletons. One skeleton is being hit by the other skeleton.]]
Skeletons sink in [[water]] and cannot [[swim]], but do not [[Damage#Drowning|drown]].

If a skeleton is inside of [[powder snow]] for {{convert|7|second|game tick}}, it begins shaking. After another {{convert|15|second|game tick}}, it converts into a [[stray]]. A newly-converted stray always has full health even if converted from a damaged skeleton. The converted stray keeps any items worn or held when it was a skeleton. Only skeletons can become strays; [[bogged]], [[parched]], or [[wither skeleton]]s cannot be converted. The process is similar to when a [[husk]] turns into a [[zombie]] or when a zombie turns into a [[drowned]] if it stays underwater for too long.  
[[File:Wolves attacking skeleton.png|alt=Wolves attacking skeleton|thumb|right|Wolves attacking a skeleton.]]
If spawned with a weapon other than a bow or no weapon at all (which can be spawned with commands such as {{cmd|/summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {HandItems:[{Count:1,id:"iron_sword"}]} }}, or {{cmd|/summon skeleton ~ ~ ~ {} }}), or it picks up a weapon other than a bow, a skeleton charges at a player with arms outstretched and deals damage by touch, similar to a wither skeleton.

A skeleton holding a [[tipped arrow]] or [[spectral arrow]] in its [[dual wield|off-hand]] always shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed.

If a skeleton kills a [[creeper]], the creeper drops a [[music disc]], randomly selected from [[Music Disc 13|13]], [[Music Disc cat|cat]], [[Music Disc blocks|blocks]], [[Music Disc chirp|chirp]], [[Music Disc far|far]], [[Music Disc mall|mall]], [[Music Disc mellohi|mellohi]], [[Music Disc stal|stal]], [[Music Disc strad|strad]], [[Music Disc ward|ward]], [[Music Disc 11|11]], and [[Music Disc wait|wait]].

=== Sunlight ===
[[File:Particle mobflame emitter.png|alt=Skeleton on fire|thumb|A skeleton burning in sunlight.]]
When the moon can no longer be seen (Dawn) and the sun is above 15°, skeletons can burn. Burning is suppressed when the skeleton is:
*in a place with a non-air block directly over it. In [[Java Edition]], the roof must be a light-blocking block.
*in a sufficiently shaded area: a [[Light#Mobs|sunlight level]] of 11 or less.
*in water. A skeleton pathfinds to water if it is not wearing head armor and not already in water.
*wearing head [[armor]]. [[Helmet]]s have a 50% chance to lose 1 durability for every tick where the skeleton would normally be set on fire.
*under the status effect of [[Fire Resistance]].
*standing in cobwebs.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|62182|Webs block sunlight from burning skeletons and zombies|date=July 16, 2014|resolution=Works as intended}}</ref>
Transparent and translucent blocks, including [[glass]] and [[ice]], do not prevent them from burning.{{only|Java|short=1}}

Unlike [[zombie]]s, skeletons seek out shelter during the day, and remain under it while attacking.

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

=== Geared skeletons ===
{{Main|Geared mobs}}
Some spawned skeletons have the ability to pick up dropped items from the ground. Unlike zombies, however, they pick up only weapons or armor. If a picked up item is [[armor]], a [[carved pumpkin]] or a [[mob head]], a skeleton equips itself with the item. If the picked up item is a [[weapon]], the skeleton uses the item as a melee weapon. {{IN|BE}}, skeletons can also pick up and equip illager banners worn in their chest slot.{{Needs testing|When was this removed?|bedrock=1}}

Skeletons spawn already armed with [[bow]]s, which may be [[enchant]]ed. The chances of that event are listed below. If a skeleton spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (all pieces are made of the same material) except if it is spawned as part of a skeleton trap, in which case only the iron helmet may not match the rest of the armor.

On {{w|Halloween}}, skeletons may spawn wearing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]]. They do not drop this, even when killed with Looting.

{{IN|je}}, a skeleton's armor does not lose durability upon taking damage. [[Helmet]]s (not [[block]]s like [[carved pumpkin]]s) on skeletons can break if the skeleton is exposed to daylight. {{IN|be}}, any armor piece is damaged as if the player is wearing it.{{Verify|Does this happen in other editions, not including Java?}}

==== Pickup mechanics ====
{{main|Geared mobs#Picking up gear}}
When picking up items, skeletons prefer [[weapon]]s that deal more damage ''without considering enchantments''. They also prefer items with NBT data over those without, and weapons that are less damaged.

For weapon types, skeletons prefer [[bow]]s over [[melee weapons]]. Skeletons won't take [[crossbow]]s, [[trident]]s or [[maces]] whatsoever, as long as they have any other item in hand.

For [[armor]], skeletons prefer armor that give more armor points than the armor to replace. Skeletons accept given cosmetic wearables ([[head]]s and [[carved pumpkin]]s), as long as they aren't wearing a [[helmet]].

If the skeleton accepts a given equipment, the skeleton drops the old one, with the same chance as if killed with Looting I, in favor of the new one. Any skeleton that spawns with equipment (picked-up items do not count) gives 1–3 extra experience points per item.

Skeletons can pick up and equip [[shields]] in the other hand, but they cannot use it to block damage. 
[[File:Skeleton with a shield.jpg|thumb|A skeleton holding a shield.]]

If multiple viable items exist, the skeleton endlessly picks up and drops the items.<ref>{{bug|MC-7774||skeletons pick drop loop|WAI}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* If alerted to a [[player]]'s presence, a skeleton can fire [[arrow]]s backward, occasionally hitting themselves.
* The artificial intelligence of skeletons {{in|be}} is a mix of skeleton AI from {{el|je}} between versions 1.5 and 1.8.9 and the skeletons in [[Update Aquatic]]. They shoot faster when they are on land and the target underwater, causing enough knockback to make combat hard. Additionally, they do not strafe left to right, and they shoot more rapidly at closer targets. Skeletons also use ranged attacks on land and switch to melee attacks when sinking underwater.
* If a skeleton has a [[sword]] or any other melee item, generally with commands, its [[AI]] resembles the [[wither skeleton]]'s AI.
* {{IN|BE}}, skeletons do not animate their [[bow]].
* [[C418]] used [https://freesound.org/people/jppi_Stu/sounds/17090/ bamboo wind chime sounds] as a base for the skeleton sounds.<ref>https://freesound.org/people/C418/downloaded_sounds/?page=1#sound</ref>
