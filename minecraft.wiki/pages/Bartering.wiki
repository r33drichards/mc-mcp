'''Bartering''' is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows [[player]]s to exchange [[gold ingot]]s for various items with [[piglin]]s.

== Mechanics ==

<onlyinclude>Adult piglins can trade gold ingots for certain items when they pick up nearby gold ingot items or when the player {{ctrl|uses}} gold ingots while looking at them. After the piglin takes the gold ingot and examines it for 6 seconds (120 gameticks) {{in|Java}} it tosses a random item to the player, or upward if no player is in sight. The full cycle time, from when a piglin accepts an ingot until it accepts the next ingot, is 6.05 seconds (121 gameticks) {{In|java}} and 8 seconds (160 gameticks) {{in|Bedrock}}.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> Baby piglins take the ingot, but do not barter; they instead store the ingot in their inventory. [[Piglin brute]]s ignore gold ingots and do not barter.

Piglins can pick up other items that are in {{Code|code=piglin_food}} or {{Code|code=piglin_loved}} tags; however, ingots are the only items that piglins accept for bartering.

Hitting a piglin causes it to "confiscate" the ingot; the piglin does not complete the barter. It cannot be bartered with again unless it puts another item in its inventory. Piglins who are killed in one hit before they finish examining always drop the ingot.

When a piglin is admiring a gold ingot, it can still be angered when the player breaks a container or a gold-related block nearby, although its behavior differs depending on the game edition. {{IN|java}}, the piglin finishes the barter on the original schedule and starts attacking the player only after the barter finishes. {{IN|bedrock}}, the piglin immediately finishes the barter and starts attacking the player,<ref>{{bug|MCPE-94099||Piglins get angry when a player destroys a chest or a gold-related item while admiring a gold item}}</ref> leading to a bartering transaction much shorter than the default 8 seconds.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-91275||Piglin can skip bartering animation when being distracted by other activities}}</ref> This allows piglins {{in|bedrock}} to barter rapidly when gold-related blocks are repeatedly broken nearby or when a gold-related block is repeatedly pushed and pulled by pistons.

Bartering is controlled by the [[loot table]] {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/piglin_bartering}}. If the [[game rule]] <code>mobGriefing</code> is {{cd|false}}, piglins barter only when the player {{control|uses}} a gold ingot on them.

{{IN|je}}, if a piglin is zombified into a [[zombified piglin]] before the bartering is complete, the newly-zombified piglin drops the gold ingot immediately. {{IN|be}}, the zombified piglin continues to hold the gold ingot after zombification and drops it upon death.

When a piglin is admiring a gold ingot while bartering, it does not run away from nearby [[zoglin]]s or zombified piglins.

Piglins sometimes pick up and equip the [[iron boots]] enchanted with [[Soul Speed]] that they have just offered while bartering. A player wanting to obtain the iron boots without killing the piglin can induce the piglin to discard the iron boots by offering a pair of [[golden boots]].<ref>{{bug|MCPE-69575||Piglins equip Soul Speed boots instead of giving them to the player|WAI}}</ref>

Bartering is the only [[renewable]] source of nether quartz, crying obsidian, soul sand, dried ghasts (both directly as a barterable item and indirectly as a product of soul sand), nether brick{{only|JE}}, gravel, blackstone, and the Soul Speed enchantment.
