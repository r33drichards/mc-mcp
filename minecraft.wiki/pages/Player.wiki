A '''player''' is a unique character whose actions are [[control]]led by the real person, and not by the game itself. They are the main character in the singleplayer [[world]] of ''Minecraft'', where most interactions and [[mechanics]] revolve around them as part of the [[gameplay]]. They may also partake in the [[multiplayer]] mode with other players, putting more emphasis on player-driven activities.

There are nine default skins for the player, known as '''[[Alex]]''', '''[[Ari]]''', '''[[Efe]]''', '''[[Kai]]''', '''[[Makena]]''', '''[[Noor]]''', '''[[Steve]]''', '''[[Sunny]]''', and '''[[Zuri]]'''.

== Appearance ==
{{Anchor|Skin|Model}}A new player can choose from [[Steve]], [[Alex]], [[Zuri]], [[Sunny]], [[Noor]], [[Makena]], [[Kai]], [[Efe]], or [[Ari]] as their main skin. They can also choose the skin from an image file in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''{{only|je|short=1}} or [[Character Creator]]{{only|be|short=1}}. They can choose between "classic" and "slim" shapes, which makes their arm models wide or slim.

{{IN|BE}}, the game allows the usage of [[skin packs]], each of which has a selection of free skins. The game also features a [[Character creator|character creation system]] with free and purchasable apparel and features from the [[Marketplace]]. On console devices, these are the only equippable skin models, and players cannot choose custom skin models imported from an image file.

{{IN|JE}}, playing in the [[Demo mode|demo]] or offline makes the game randomly choose any of the nine skins as the current skin.

The player's appearance can be obscured by equipping [[armor]], such as [[turtle shell]], [[helmet]]s, [[chestplate]]s, [[legging]]s, and [[boot]]s, as well as other equippable items such as [[elytra]], [[carved pumpkin]], and [[head]]s of [[mob]]s and other players. Players are also the only entity capable of having [[cape]]s, as well as other cosmetics from their [[Character Creator|character creation]].

In ''Java Edition'', if the player is shot with an [[arrow]] or stung by a [[bee]], the arrow or stinger appears physically embedded inside the player for a given time. These do not apply to other mobs.

Unlike their ''Java Edition'' counterparts, ''Bedrock Edition'' players periodically blink; this feature does not apply to custom skin models set from an image file.

== Drops ==
*The content of their [[inventory]] (except the items with [[Curse of Vanishing]])
*Current XP level multiplied by 7, which is then the amount of points dropped. This is capped at 100 XP points, which corresponds to just over level 7. 

If {{cmd|gamerule keepInventory}} has been set to <code>true</code>, nothing is dropped.

== Interaction range ==
{{main|Interaction range}}
[[File:Player reach.png|alt=An in-game screenshot showing a red circle around other player to indicate the user's attack reach of a spherical area of three blocks.|thumb|205x205px|The attack reach area of 3 blocks is indicated by a red circle.]]
{{anchor|Reach}}A player's interaction range (reach) differs. The area forms a three-dimensional cylinder because it encompasses vertical and horizontal distances:<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20240613063548/https://streamable.com/h2aq7m Vertical attack reach forms a cylinder, not a sphere.]</ref>{{needs testing|Video is in Bedrock Edition, is it also a cylinder in Java?|java=1}}

{{:Interaction range}}

== Health and hunger meters ==
{{Main|Health|Damage}}

The player has 10 full hearts or 20 health points. One full heart represents two [[health|health points]]. When the player's [[hunger]] bar is at {{Hunger|18}} or higher, health slowly regenerates by {{Hp|1}} every four seconds, but when it is at {{Hunger|20}} with saturation remaining, health regenerates by {{Hp|1}} every half second.{{Only|Java|short=JE}} The hunger bar depletes faster from energy-intensive activities like [[sprinting]], [[jumping]], attacking [[mobs]], and [[mining]], and it can be refilled by eating [[food]]. If the hunger bar is at {{Hunger|17}} or lower, the player does not regenerate health unless in Peaceful [[difficulty]] (or under the effect of certain [[potion]]s). While the hunger bar is at {{Hunger|0}}, the player is starving and proceeds to lose health. On Hard and Hardcore difficulties, starvation kills the player. On Normal difficulty, it brings health down to {{hp|1}}. On Easy difficulty, it brings health down to {{hp|10}}. On Peaceful difficulty, the health bar recovers regardless of hunger, but still depletes from starvation damage, and the hunger bar does not lose any points even when under the effect of hunger.

== Movement ==
{{see also|Controls#Configurable controls}}

=== Walking ===

The most basic movement the player can perform is [[walking]]. The player can walk at a reasonable speed rate of 4.317 [[Blocks tall|blocks]] per second{{fn|About 15.5 kph or 9.7 mph, which is a 3:51 kilometer or a 6:12 mile.}}, all while taking no [[hunger]] impact. This means that the player can walk a total of 5181 blocks{{fn|About 5.2 kilometer.}} in [[Daylight cycle|one ''Minecraft'' day]], in a straight line, without sprinting or sneaking.

=== Sprinting ===
The player can move faster by [[sprinting]], but at the cost of draining the [[hunger]] bar considerably while doing so. The player sprints approximately 5.612 [[Blocks tall|blocks]] per second{{fn|About 20.2 kph or 12.6&nbsp;mph, which is a 2:58&nbsp;km or a 4:46 mile.}}, as opposed to the regular pace of 4.317 blocks per second. The maximum distance a player can jump when sprinting is approximately<!-- 4.225 value is from JUST running until you get to max speed, and then doing a single jump. to a couple more decimal points, value is 4.224812.

5 blocks is NOT possible without some major caveats --> 4.225 blocks. The [[Speed]] [[effect]] increases momentum. The player cannot sprint if the hunger bar is at {{hunger|6}} or less. Sprinting is activated by double-tapping the forward key (default {{key|W}}), then holding it, or by holding the sprint key ({{key|Ctrl}} by default, {{key|Cmd}} if using a Mac) while pressing the forward key. Holding the sprint key in [[Creative mode]] while [[flying]] causes the player to fly faster.

=== Sneaking ===
[[Sneaking]] is a feature activated by pressing and holding the sneak key (default is {{key|Shift}}). Sneaking prevents players from falling more than half a block, making it highly useful for building horizontally outward over space. Going past the edge of a block and stopping sneaking does not result in falling off that block. The player can still dismount blocks while sneaking by jumping over the block's edge. In [[multiplayer]], a player's name tag is grayed out in ''Java Edition'' or completely disappears in Bedrock Edition when they sneak, to relate to the fact that sneaking makes them harder to see.

=== Jumping ===
The maximum height a player can [[Jumping|jump]] without the [[Jump Boost]] effect is about 1.2522 blocks in Java Edition. The jump height on Bedrock Edition is shorter (similar to the pre-[[Combat Update]]) with the value of 1.24919 blocks.

=== Swimming ===
[[Swimming]] occurs when the player is sprinting (by double pressing W or pressing Ctrl/Cmd) while the player is submerged underwater. Swimming has the same animation as crawling.

=== Crawling ===
[[Crawling]] occurs when the player is in an area less than 1.5 blocks high and prevents suffocation.

{{fnlist}}

== Movement speed ==

There isn't a simple hard-coded maximum velocity for walking, sprinting, etc. The maximum is a result of a base acceleration countered by "friction" or air resistance. The base acceleration for walking is 0.098, and sprinting is 30% faster than that. Velocity is increased by this acceleration value every tick (1/20th of a second), then the player is moved by the resulting velocity, then the velocity is multiplied by the friction value of the block they are walking on. For most blocks, the friction value is 0.546. As the player walks forward, each tick their velocity goes +0.098, *0.546, +.098, *0.546, +0.098, and so on. The result is that eventually, the 0.546 multiplier counteracts the 0.098 increase, so the player doesn't go any faster. The formula for this "terminal velocity" is a/(1-r), where a is the acceleration, and r is the block's friction. 0.098/(1-0.546) ≈ 0.2159 meters/tick = 4.317 meters/second. Sprinting is 30% faster than that, at about 5.612 meters/second. Flying is similar, but the base acceleration is 0.049 and the "friction" is 0.91, which comes out to ~10.89&nbsp;m/s.

== Gameplay HUD ==
The onscreen [[heads-up display]] (HUD) consists of the player's [[health]] bar, [[hunger]] bar, [[experience]] bar, and [[hotbar]]. The [[armor]] rating bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor and the oxygen bar appears if the player is submerged in [[water]] or is suffocating in a block{{only|be|short=1}}. The HUD also contains the crosshair and a held object or fist. The HUD can also be toggled by {{key|F1}}.

As mentioned in the [[#Game modes|Game modes]] section, when the player is in [[Creative]] mode, the health, hunger, experience, armor, and oxygen bars are hidden, and only the hotbar is visible. Despite this, the player can still collect experience and wear armor. The screen tilting animation (the animation for taking damage) still plays when dying from {{cmd|kill}} or the [[void]]. In [[Spectator]] mode, the hotbar, crosshair, and held object/fist are also hidden; {{in|je}}, the hotbar appears as a player spectating list when a number is pressed or the mouse wheel is scrolled.

== Experience ==
{{Main|Experience}}
Experience points (XP) can be gained via [[experience orbs]] when killing mobs or mining certain minerals. The current level is indicated by a green number above the HUD, and the experience points can be used to enchant weapons, tools, or armor with different useful attributes and skills (see [[enchanting table]].) [[Anvil]]s require experience to use.

The level increases by obtaining enough experience points. All levels and points are lost upon death but can be partially restored by picking up the experience orbs at the place of death.<ref>http://www.pcgamer.com/first-details-on-minecrafts-xp-system-notch-when-you-die-you-lose-all-levels-you-lose-all-xp/</ref>

Experience is also obtained through activities such as [[Breaking|mining]], [[fishing]], mob [[breeding]], killing certain [[mob]]s, [[trading]], or [[smelting]].

== Game modes ==
{{main|Survival|Creative|Hardcore|Adventure|Spectator}}
* In Survival mode, the player can place and destroy most blocks, and use all tools available. The player has limited health ({{health|2|notag=1}} icons), hunger ({{hunger|2|notag=1}} icons), and oxygen (bubble icons)
* In Creative mode, the player can [[fly]] by double-tapping the jump key (default {{key|Space}}) and place an infinite number of blocks, but with limited use of crafting and tools. No mobs attack the player. The player cannot take damage at all {{in|be}}. {{IN|je}}, the player only takes damage falling into the [[void]] or when killed by {{cmd|kill}}). The player also has no hunger, has unlimited oxygen, and can [[break]] blocks instantly.
* In Hardcore mode, the player can respawn only in [[Spectator]] mode, and the [[difficulty]] level is locked on Hard mode.
* In Adventure mode, there are no changes from Survival mode aside from being unable to break or place blocks unless they possess a tool with the <code>[[Data component format#can_break|can_break]]</code> item component for that block, or have a block with the <code>[[Data component format#can_place_on|can_place_on]]</code> component. This game mode can be played only by having [[cheats]] enabled and typing the command {{cmd|gamemode adventure}}, or by opening a [[multiplayer]] or [[LAN]] world.
* In Spectator mode, the player can spectate almost all [[mob]]s, ride them as if the player were in a minecart, fly through blocks, and open inventories, but cannot break blocks or change inventories. Along with [[Adventure]], it can be accessed by typing in {{cmd|gamemode spectator}}, pressing {{Key|F3}}+{{Key|F4}} until Spectator mode (the eye of ender) is selected or {{Key|F3}}+{{Key|N}}  while cheats are enabled, or [[Death|dying]] in [[Hardcore]] mode. However, with the [[Debug Mode]] world type, the gamemode is locked as Spectator mode unless changed with cheats enabled.

== Username ==
Players in-game are referred to by a username. These are used to target the player with [[commands]] and differentiate other players.  

{{IN|je}}, usernames must be 3-16 characters, although there are exceptions for players with under 3 characters, who bought the game early in its development. Players can change their username no more than once every 30 days on [[minecraft.net]]. When the player changes their username, the previous username is available for other users to claim after 37 days. Because players can change usernames every 30 days, a player can manage two usernames without anyone being able to take either of them. If the player has a username under 3 characters and changes it, the old sub-3-character username is permanently unable to be obtained again.<ref>https://namemc.com/name/NY</ref> This also applies for symbol names.<ref>https://namemc.com/search?q=y-93</ref> The username can be changed on the [https://minecraft.net/profile preferences page] of minecraft.net.

{{IN|be}}, usernames chosen in-game must be 3-32 characters. Users can choose a username and change it any time in the [[Settings#Account|Profile]] settings. Alternatively, users signed in with a {{w|Microsoft account}} have the username set to match their {{w|Gamertag}}. Gamertags can be changed on the [https://social.xbox.com/changegamertag change gamertag page] in the Xbox website for a fee of {{w|US$}}9.99, though changing it for the first time is free.<ref>https://support.xbox.com/help/account-profile/profile/change-xbox-live-gamertag</ref>

Player names appear above their head as nameplates, typically in white letters within a dark transparent rectangle. Player nameplates can also be seen through solid blocks and other obstructions, although a player can [[sneak]] to dim the nameplate's visibility when in sight in ''Java Edition'', or hide it completely when out of sight in ''Bedrock Edition''.

== Customization ==
{{main|Skin|Character Creator}}
[[File:Player size comparison.png|thumb|The player height options in Bedrock Edition.]]

{{IN|JE}}, players can change skins in the [https://minecraft.net/profile preferences page] on [[minecraft.net]], or in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' by uploading a {{w|PNG}} image file. Players also have the option to have wide or slim arms on the character model.

{{IN|BE}}, players are given five character slots which they can customize their appearances by selecting pre-made apparels, altering their heights, changing their looks, and more. They are available on the [[Character Creator]] menu, accessible under the [[title screen]] or [[pause menu]]. These characters are synchronized between devices signed-in using {{w|Microsoft account}}. Alternatively, players have option to select from classic skins with [[skin pack]]s obtained from the [[Marketplace]]. They can select or remove a [[cape]] for classic skins. Classic skins obtained from importing image file are not available on console devices, and cannot be synchronized between devices.

Players can also choose four [[emotes]] per character slot.

==Issues==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*The original Steve skin and player model was originally created for another one of Notch's games called ''[[Zombie Town]]''.
*The player's eye level (according to coordinates on the [[debug screen]]) is 1.62m when standing, 1.27m when sneaking and 0.4m when swimming, crawling or gliding.
*The player's actual size doesn't match the hitbox. Their model is as tall as 2 blocks, but is scaled down by a factor of 0.9375, making them 1.875m tall and 0.9375m wide, exactly 2 texels shorter than the height of 2 blocks.
*The player's legs do not line up perfectly with the torso to prevent {{w|z-fighting}} when wearing armor.<ref>{{bug|MC-42|||WAI}}</ref>
*{{IN|Bedrock}}, a dead player can still collect [[experience orbs]] near their death location until they choose to respawn.
*Before [[Java Edition 1.14]], the camera was located at the player's feet; the world is therefore rendered 1.8 blocks below what it should be at to counteract this.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|1099982036339748865|Today I discovered that our camera is at the players feet - but it's okay, because the world is all rendered about 1.8 blocks down, so it evens out! :D|February 25, 2019}}</ref>
**Likewise, when the player slept in a bed, the world revolved around the player during the animation instead of the player's camera rotating, which led to some visual bugs.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|1100001119407878150|Another one: when the player is in a bed and lying down, we don't move the camera to the bed. We just move and rotate the whole world to make it be in front of where the camera was last. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯|February 25, 2019}}</ref>
*With a length of 3 to 16 characters and <span class="explain" title="The letters A-Z uppercase and lowercase, the numbers 0-9, and an underscore '_'">63 characters to choose from</span>, the total number of possible player usernames in {{JE}} is <math>\sum_{n=3}^{16} 63^n \approx 6.257 \times 10^{28}</math> or more than 62 octillion.
