'''International Space Station''' is a [[Marketplace]] map themed around the real life [[w:International Space Station|International Space Station]].

== Summary ==
Players spawn inside a room, cradled with a [[chest]] and several [[stained glass]] windows, showing the [[void]]. In the player's [[inventory]] is a book, ''ISS Field Manual'' by Dr. Ed Yukator. Behind the chest is a [[sign]], inviting the player into the ISS. Passing through an [[iron door]], players will enter a bizarre room, with many floating [[levers]], [[buttons]], [[iron bars]], and [[nether brick fence]]s. At the end of the hall are several [[paintings]] with [[iron trapdoor]]s, representing monitors, and behind those a door with a split path. Due to the space station's lack of gravity, however, the path is split vertically and horizontally.

Dropping down through an [[oak trapdoor]] surrounded by [[smooth stone slabs]], players will fall down a long tunnel into a chamber made of [[block of quartz|quartz]], with [[sea lanterns]] at the bottom. A similar room lies above the entrance. The horizontal path is a hallway lined with [[blocks of iron]] and iron trapdoors, leading to a door of [[green terracotta]], with a similar splitting path. In this vertical path are more "monitors" and redstone blocks, such as [[daylight detector]]s and [[redstone repeater]], and beyond that a wider chamber. To the right of this room is an airlock, marked by a sign, consisting of a [[polished andesite]] [[piston door]], and near it is another vertical room in the floor. This one is much wider, with many "machines" such as nether brick fences and added [[light blue carpet]]s.

To the left of the room is a hallway with items such as [[ladders]] and [[pressure plate]]s, leading to a window in the floor marked with [[blocks of lapis lazuli]] and [[white wool]]. Straight through the preceeding chamber is a fourth path, into a similarly wide room with a door made of [[cyan wool]] with [[carpet|blue carpet]]s. Inside is a slightly raised section with green carpets, a wall of [[fence|birch fences]], monitors, levers, and bars. At the end is another wide door lined with blue carpets, with two iron doors leading nowhere installed in the walls, and three more paths. The right path, the ''Columbus Module'', is identified by a [[tripwire hook]], and represents a named laboratory in the real space station, with several [[item frames]] and colored wool at the end. The left path is another long hall with floating blocks. Heading straight, ''Hatch to NASA Shuttle'', serving as another exit, this time using an iron door.
