'''The Moon''' is a joke [[dimension]] that can be accessed in snapshot [[Java Edition 23w13a or b|23w13a_or_b]] by flying up to Y=700 in the [[Overworld]].

The Moon has a weak gravitational pull. So weak, in fact, that at certain heights the player is pulled back to Earth, "falling up", so to say. The player's oxygen also decreases on the Moon, though much slower than in water. [[Cheese]], which makes up almost the entirety of the Moon, restores both hunger and oxygen, allowing the player to survive here.

== Accessing ==
The Moon can be accessed by flying up to Y=700 in the Overworld. Conversely, flying up to Y=700 on the Moon brings the player back to the Overworld.

== Traits ==
Upon arriving on the Moon, the player is spawned at Y=600 and falls toward the Moon's surface. A player who jumps on the Moon while being above Y=117 gets pulled back up toward Earth, although this can be counteracted with either [[elytra]] or [[Creative]] mode flight. Strength of the gravitational pull varies with height; while standing on Y=117, player is able to jump about 9 blocks up, and while standing on Y=1, jump height decreases to only 3 blocks.

The Moon is composed almost entirely out of [[cheese]], a reference to the [[w:The Moon is made of green cheese|misconception/joke that the Moon is made out of cheese]]. The surface is covered with craters of various sizes and ravines. The highest naturally generated cheese layer occurs at Y=60. At the bottom of the Moon, there are 5 layers of [[bedrock]], generating in the same way as in the Overworld and Nether. There are no caves on the Moon. Only one structure generates: the [[lunar base]].

There is no weather, but [[daylight cycle]] occurs, with Earth visible in the sky instead of the [[Moon]]. The sky does not change its color regardless of the position of the Sun, due to the Moon having no atmosphere. Players slowly suffocate, and it takes 5 minutes to use up all oxygen. Neither Respiration nor [[Water Breathing]] can prevent this. If the player runs out of oxygen and dies on the Moon, the death message says "<player> experienced [[W:the dark side of the moon|the dark side of the moon]]".

Both [[bed]]s and [[respawn anchor]]s explode if the player tries to set their spawnpoint, just like in [[the End]].

== Biomes ==
The Moon has only one biome, bearing the same name.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
