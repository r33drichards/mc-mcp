The '''Update Aquatic''' is the name for a major update that was released for most versions of ''Minecraft'' in 2018, with the exception of the [[Xbox One Edition|''Xbox One'']], [[Nintendo Switch Edition|''Nintendo Switch'']], and [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition|''New Nintendo 3DS'']] editions. The Update Aquatic focuses on revamping the [[ocean]]s in ''Minecraft'', adding many new aquatic mobs, blocks, items, and structures. The update marks the advent of the trend of major themed content updates being released across certain editions relatively simultaneously, rather than across differently-titled, unrelated-sounding updates per edition.

The official name for the update, the ''Update Aquatic'', was revealed on November 18, 2017, during the [[MINECON Earth 2017]] live stream, at which time the ''Java Edition'' Update Aquatic was to be released as 1.14.
For ''Java Edition'', this update was previously intended to succeed an update titled '''Technically Updated''',<ref>{{mcnet|java-edition-technically-updated}}</ref> until the decision was made to merge Update Aquatic into 1.13 due to the world generation rewrite taking longer than expected.

On July 10, 2018, [[Mojang Studios]] released a trailer for the update.<ref>{{ytl|hcutClmY1pI|Update Aquatic - Dive in!|Minecraft|July 10, 2018}}</ref>

== Release ==
The update was released for {{JE}} on July 18, 2018 as version [[Java Edition 1.13|''Java Edition 1.13'']].<ref name=merge>{{Mcnet|java-edition-technically-updated|Java Edition Technically Updated!|January 24, 2018|Marsh Davies}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|update-aquatic-out-java|Update Aquatic Out On Java!|July 18, 2018|Adrian Östergård}}</ref>

The update was released for the [[Xbox 360 Edition|''Xbox 360'']], [[PlayStation 3 Edition|''PlayStation 3'']], [[PlayStation 4 Edition|''PlayStation 4'']], [[PlayStation Vita Edition|''PlayStation Vita'']], and [[Wii U Edition|''Wii U'']] editions, on September 11, 2018.<ref>{{tweet|4JStudios|1039438403710808064|An update for Minecraft Console Edition on Sony consoles is rolling out worldwide now, and later today/early tomorrow on Xbox 360 and Wii U !|September 11, 2018}}</ref> The [[Xbox One Edition|''Xbox One'']], [[Nintendo Switch Edition|''Nintendo Switch'']], and [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition|''New Nintendo 3DS'']] editions were omitted from the update.

On {{BE}}, the Update Aquatic was split into two updates, with most of the features being released in Phase One as version [[Bedrock Edition 1.4.0|1.4.0]] on May 16, 2018,<ref>{{Mcnet|update-aquatic-phase-one-out-now|Update Aquatic Phase One is out now!|May 16, 2018|Tom Stone}}</ref> and more features released in Phase Two as version [[Bedrock Edition 1.5.0|1.5.0]] on July 10, 2018.<ref>{{tweet|Mega_Spud|1016603321145217024|Who is ready for #UpdateAquatic part 2? Switch players should start seeing the update right now, with other platforms diving in later today! Get ready for Turtles, Conduits, and more!<br/>#Minecraft|July 10, 2018}}</ref> Additional features were added in [[Bedrock Edition 1.6.0|1.6.0]] on August 28, 2018.

The update was also released for the {{el|ce}}; it was released on mobile devices on July 6, 2018, and on Windows on July 10, 2018.<ref>{{cite|url=https://mc.163.com/news/20180619/29175_757767.html|title=重磅来袭！《我的世界》海洋更新上线时间首次曝光！}}</ref>
