'''Karl Patrick Geuder''' is a Director of Business Development at [[Mojang Studios]].

Until July 3, 2012, Geuder was a contractor who provided services to a variety of companies, with Mojang being one of them. He performed large-scale data analysis at the time.

On July 30, 2013, Geuder mentioned that he'd like to see cherry trees in ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{tweet|pgeuder|361884775880982529|I would love to see (sharing this with millions of Japanese people?) cherry trees in Minecraft. http://youtu.be/C6xi9JMDv44 @jeb_ @Dinnerbone}}</ref> [[Nathan Adams]] responded that he would add them if Geuder did the coding.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|361892350424911873|@pgeuder @jeb_ You code it, we'll add it.}}</ref> On February 14, 2023, [[cherry tree]]s were officially announced for the upcoming [[Trails & Tales|1.20]] update. When asked about his initial suggestion, Geuder mentioned that he had taken part in two prototype initiatives related to cherry blossoms.<ref>{{tweet|pgeuder|1625613504769040414|Haha, yes! I did, got a ”code blanche” from @Dinnerbone, was part in 2 separate prototype initiatives related to sakura/cherry blossom. Finally it’s happened! Thanks all involved, like @_LadyAgnes @nekofresa @TorbjornAllard’s team.}}</ref> A news article on [[minecraft.net]] stated that Geuder had been planning and working on cherry trees' implementation for about 10 years before they were released.<ref>{{Mcnet|cherry-leaves|Block of the Month: Cherry leaves|March 8, 2024}}</ref>
