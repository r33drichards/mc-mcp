'''17w16a''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.12]], released on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{snap|17w16a|id=b|April 20, 2017}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Note Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Note block]]s'''
* When placed on top of a bone block, wool, clay, packed ice, or gold blocks, the note block produces no sound when altered or activated (this is to make place for new note block sounds coming up).
** Added sound events (when using {{cmd|playsound}}) for the following:
*** <code>minecraft:block.note.bell</code>
*** <code>minecraft:block.note.chime</code>
*** <code>minecraft:block.note.flute</code>
*** <code>minecraft:block.note.guitar</code>
*** <code>minecraft:block.note.xylophone</code>

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Illusioner JE1.png|24px]] [[Illusioner]]s '''
* New [[illager]].
* Affects players with {{EffectLink|Blindness}} for 20 seconds then shoots with a [[bow]].
* Summons duplicates of itself.
** All duplicates show the shooting animation, but only the real one can be attacked.
* Does not currently have a [[spawn egg]], therefore it can only be summoned with {{cmd|summon illusion_illager}}.
* Targets both players and villagers.

=== Command format ===
'''Selectors'''
* <code>@s</code>
* Targets the executing entity, e.g: <code>/[[execute]] @e[type=Villager] ~ ~ ~ /say @s</code>

=== General ===
[[File:Hints.png|thumb|All the tutorial hints.]]
'''<nowiki>Version exclusive: </nowiki>[[Tutorial hints]]'''
* Displayed in the top right.
* Display only in [[Survival]] mode, and only upon starting a new world for the first time.
** Saved per player, stored in [[options.txt]].
*** Name: <code>tutorialStep</code>
*** List of criteria: {{cd|d=and|movement|find_tree|punch_tree|open_inventory|craft_planks|none}}.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* '''Version exclusive''': Added keybinding options for [[Creative]] mode saving to [[saved toolbars]].

'''JSON format'''
* Added 'group' to recipe JSON format, to clump similar recipes together.
* Added new 'keybind' text component, to refer to the player's keybindings.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Hardened clay]]'''
* Renamed to terracotta.

'''[[Glazed terracotta]]'''
* No longer "stick" to [[slime block]]s, but can still be pushed by pistons.

'''[[Shulker box]]es'''
* Colors changed in accordance with the changes to other block colors.
** This causes the 'default' (purple) shulker boxes to be a vibrant purple that mismatches all other purpur items and blocks (reverted in [[17w17a]]).

'''[[Command block]]s'''
* Now executes all of the commands in a chain before scheduling them for the next tick.
** It is now possible to stop/modify the operation of a chain via commands and get results instantly (as opposed to getting them in a 1 tick delay).

=== Items ===
'''[[Fishing rod]]s'''
* '''Version exclusive''': Added sounds for reeling in the fishing bobber.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:NewShulkerColors.png|thumb|right|250px|Comparison of old and new shulker and shulker box colors.]]
'''[[Shulker]]s'''
* Colors changed in accordance with the changes to other block colors.
** This causes the 'default' (purple) shulkers to be a vibrant purple that mismatches all other purpur items and blocks (reverted in [[17w17a]]).

=== General ===
'''[[Narrator]]'''
* Now displays a message whenever it isn't available.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* '''Version exclusive''': Pressing {{key|F1}} now hides all toast messages.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Improved NBT parsing in commands.
** Keys can now (optionally) be quoted, e.g: <code>"Motion":[0.0,0.0,0.0]</code>
** Unquoted string values are now stricter; they can no longer contain spaces or special symbols, e.g: <code>CustomName:Test Test</code>
** Indices, which were previously optional in lists, are no longer allowed, e.g: <code>Motion:[0:7.3,1:1.0,2:3.1]</code>
** Empty keys and values are no longer allowed.
* Improved error messaging; now points to where exactly the error occurred.
