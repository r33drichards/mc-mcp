'''Mending''' is an [[enchantment]] that restores an item's [[durability]] when a player collects [[experience orbs]].

== Obtaining ==
Mending is a [[treasure enchantment]]; it can be obtained from a [[mineshaft]], [[jungle pyramid]], [[bastion remnant]], [[stronghold]], [[End city]], [[ancient city]] [[chest loot]], [[vault]]s, [[fishing]], [[raid]] drops,{{only|bedrock|short=1}} or by [[trading]] with a [[librarian]] of any level (or if the "[[Villager Trade Rebalance]]" experimental datapack is enabled, a master level swamp librarian).

== Usage ==
* Any items with Mending in the player's main hand, offhand, or armor slots that are not at maximum durability are repaired by [[experience orb]]s collected from any source. The rate of repair is two durability per point of experience contained in the orb.
** Experience in the orb is deducted by one point for every two durability points repaired. 
** Experience left in the orb is added to the player's total experience gauge as normal, but prioritizes mending items. You can't pick up exp when you hold/wear items with mending enchantment and with not full durability.
* If multiple equipped items have the enchantment and need to be repaired, one is randomly selected for each experience orb collected. No item or location has priority for repair.
** Mending does not select items that are already fully repaired. For example, if the player has a fully repaired helmet and a damaged chestplate, leggings, and boots, only the latter 3 are considered in the random chance to be repaired.
** Durability doesn't affect which item is chosen at random. For example, a sword that is one durability point away from being fully repaired has an equal chance of being chosen as a pickaxe that is almost broken, even if this means less experience would be used to repair the sword.
** Only one of these items is repaired for each experience orb collected. This means that any experience left on the orb is not used to repair other items and is instead added to the player's total experience gauge as normal.

== Incompatibilities ==
Mending is incompatible with [[Infinity]]. If [[commands]] are used to have two or more of these enchantments on the same item, their effects stack.
