A '''gold ingot''' is a [[metal]] ingot used to craft various armour, tools, and [[item]]s, and also used as currency for [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s.

== Obtaining ==
Gold ingots are mainly obtained by smelting [[raw gold]], [[gold ore]] and [[nether gold ore]], or just mining nether gold ore, dropping gold nuggets. Gold generates more frequently in [[badlands]] biomes.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient===
As a material for weapons, tools, and armor, gold is not a straight upgrade from iron (except in the case of [[horse armor]]). Gold has a higher mining speed and enchantability than any other material, but low attack power and durability.

*{{ItemLink|Golden Sword}}

*{{ItemLink|Golden Axe}}
*{{ItemLink|Golden Shovel}}
*{{ItemLink|Golden Hoe}}

=== Bartering ===
{{main|Bartering}}
[[Piglin]]s throw the player [[Bartering#Mechanics|item(s)]] if the player throws or {{ctrl|uses}} a gold ingot on them.

=== Beacons ===
Gold ingots can be used to select powers from a [[beacon]]. The player must select one of the available powers and then insert an ingot in the item slot. 

A gold ingot can be substituted for an [[iron ingot]] or [[netherite ingot]], an [[emerald]], or a [[diamond]].
