The '''loading world screen''' is a screen displayed when generating or loading a [[world]]. It shows the percentage of the loading progress.

{{Update|Spawn chunks have been removed, update this section accordingly|section=1}}[[File:Chunk colormap.gif|thumb|Chunk colormap of [[Seed (world generation)|seed]] 0.]]

The loading screen {{in|Java}} shows a chunk '''colormap''', which is a square that visualizes the rendering of the initial chunks, the radius of which is equal to the value of {{cd|[[Game rule|spawnChunkRadius]]}} + 13. It populates with colored pixels that change color and expand as chunks load. Each pixel represents a chunk, and the color represents the chunk status. Like on other menu screens in ''Java Edition'', a blurred and darkened view of the [[panorama]] is shown in the background.

The loading screen {{in|bedrock}} shows the menu screen [[panorama]] in the background with an [[experience]] progress bar, and [[loading tips]].

Depending on the game's world options, specific loading tips will appear, for example when the world has [[add-on]]s or [[Creative]] mode.

When connecting to a world in ''Minecraft'' [[Realms]], a unique backround is shown. Furthermore, the current server region for the Realm and the ping are shown below the loading tips.
