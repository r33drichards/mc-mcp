** Added an optional <code>light_emission</code> field to block model elements.

* It is possible to select any of the visible items to pull out of the bundle.
** Right-clicking takes the first item.
** Using the number keys or scroll wheel to select a different item, then right-click to take it.

'''[[Redstone dust]]'''
* The performance impact of redstone wire (connected blocks of redstone dust) has been improved.
* Redstone wire now only triggers block updates on blocks that may receive power from the wire.
* Before a line of wire causes block updates, the new signal strength of all connected wires is set.
* The update order around redstone wire has been changed.

'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added new gamerule <code>minecartMaxSpeed</code> that changes the maximum speed of minecarts.
** Defaults to <code>8</code> and goes up to <code>1000</code> blocks per second.
** Setting it to a specific value does not guarantee that a minecart can reach that particular max speed - there are built in air resistances and similar effects that the speed added through slopes or powered rails need to overcome.
** This gamerule only exists in worlds with the experiment [[Minecart Improvements]] enabled.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added a new accessibility setting that makes players follow the rotation of minecarts they ride.
** Defaults to off.
** Only has effect when within a world with the experiment [[Minecart Improvements]] enabled.
