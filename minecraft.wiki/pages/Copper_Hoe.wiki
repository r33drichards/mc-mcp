A '''copper hoe''' is a variant of [[hoe]] that is crafted from [[copper ingot]]s. It is used to [[till]] [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks into [[farmland]], and to break [[leaves]], [[haybale]]s, and [[Sculk family|sculk-related]] blocks faster. It is the fourth-highest [[tier]] of hoe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[stone hoe]].

== Usage ==
=== Harvesting ===
A copper hoe can be used to harvest various [[plant]] blocks, [[Nether fungi]], and [[sculk]] blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 [[durability]].

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.

=== Tilling ===
A copper hoe can be used to turn [[dirt]], [[grass block]]s, and [[dirt path]]s into [[farmland]]. To till, press {{control|use}} on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]], nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including [[snow layers]] or [[torch]]es. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.

A copper hoe can be used to convert [[coarse dirt]] into regular dirt by pressing {{control|use}} on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.

A copper hoe can also be used on [[rooted dirt]], which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a [[hanging roots]] item.

Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a copper hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.

A copper hoe is unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.

A copper hoe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[copper ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 47 durability (25% of its maximum durability, rounded down). Two copper hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the copper hoe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A copper hoe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
