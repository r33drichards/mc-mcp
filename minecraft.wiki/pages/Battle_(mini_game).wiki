Battle was added to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] on June 21, 2016. 

== Description ==
[[File:Battle.png|thumb|300px|Gameplay of the Battle mini game.]]
The gameplay of Battle differs from the standard "Hunger Games" mode in a variety of ways, such as:

* A fifteen-second grace period
* Refilling chests
* The ability to remove all [[items]] from a [[chest]] at once
* [[Armor]] is automatically equipped when acquired (stronger armor is prioritized)
* Players can heal and [[sprint]] so long as they are not [[starving]]
* A red outline surrounds the [[crosshair]], indicating where [[damage]] was received from
* [[TNT]] is ignited upon placement
* "Showdown" begins after an extensive amount of time has passed, where name tags for remaining players become visible and a countdown clock begins
* Following the completion of a round, a leaderboard is displayed, which includes the number of kills by each player and other statistics.

Up to 16 players can join a single game on ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'', 8 players on ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[Wii U Edition]]'', and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'', and 4 players on ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]''. A "Casual" or "Competitive" option can be chosen when creating a lobby, which can either allow or restrict the use of smaller-sized skins and can change the appearance of spectators. Spectators cannot pass through blocks, but can fly through one block tall spaces. As of TU60 and equivalent updates, the [[totem of undying]] can be found in a map's center chests, commonly in the High Power mode, occasionally in the Food Central mode, and never in the Decayed mode.

'''Custom Battle''' is an option that allows a player to change various aspects of Battle, such as:

* Item Set:
** Normal – Description: A standard, balanced set of items.
** No Armor – Chests never have any armor. Stone pickaxes and iron pickaxes only appear in this item set. Potion of Leaping 2 can appear in central chests upon start. Unlike other potions the duration is not shortened. Description: No armor items at all! 
** High Power – Armor and weapons are at least iron, with diamond equipment and enchanted equipment appearing significantly more often. Food also becomes exclusively [[rabbit stew]] and [[cooked mutton]]. Description: The most powerful items in Minecraft. 
** Decayed – Armor and weapons have low durability and the chance of more powerful loot is reduced. Description: Every item breaks after only a few uses.
** Food Central – Food and potions only appear in the central chests. Many more different food items can be obtained. Description: Only the central chests have food, and the outer chests don't have any! 
** Random - Description: Pick a random item set every rounds to keep things fresh.
* Hunger Settings:
** Normal – The standard hunger settings, specifically designed for battle. Players can heal and sprint for longer, but cannot stand still without getting hungry. 
** Anti-Camping – Hunger is lost quicker when idling than usual. Sneaking, walking and swimming causes no exhaustion.<br>Description: Slightly rebalanced hunger settings to prevent players from staying in one place. 
** Fast Healing – Players regenerate twice as fast, regenerating causes slightly more exhaustion, players require more hunger points to be able to regenerate. <br>Description: Players heal faster than usual.
** No Starving – Players never take damage starvation damage. 
** Always Healing – Players never take starvation damage, can always regenerate health. Regeneration is slower. <br>Description: Players constantly regenerate health over time, but cannot sprint if they are too hungry. This setting is better for long games than short ones. 
** No Hunger – The hunger bar is not used, albeit still being visible; players can sprint, but cannot heal or starve.
** Lead Feet – Sprinting, jumping and swimming cause much more exhaustion than usual. 
** Always Hungry – Every action causes you to lose much more hunger than usual. Regeneration usually uses up 3 hunger points. <br>Description: Every action causes much more exhaustion than usual.
* Spectator Mode:
** [[Bat]] – Default appearance for spectators in a Casual match.
** [[Parrot]] – Spectators appear as various parrots.
** [[Vex]] – Spectators appear as a Vex.
** Player Head – Spectators appear as a translucent version of their head.
** Invisible – Default appearance for spectators in a Competitive match.
* Miscellaneous settings
** Random Spawn – When enabled, players spawn at various locations around the map.
** Allow All Skins – When enabled, players can use any skin, including "unfair" skins such as small, floating, headless or transparent characters. This option is disabled in Competitive matches and enabled in Casual matches. A list of "unfair" skins is available below.
** Take Everything – When enabled, players can empty a chest with one button.
** Small Inventory – When enabled, only the [[hotbar]], armor, and offhand inventory slots are available.
** Map Size – Auto, Small, Large; on Xbox One and PS4, Large+ is also available. When set to Auto, the sizes depend on the player count: Small is chosen at 2-4 players, Large at 5-8, and Large+ at 9-16. Small is the smallest and has the least chests, Large has more chests and areas, and Large+ has the same map as Large but even more chests, having 9 chests at spawn compared to 5 that the other settings have.

=== Unfair skins ===
[[File:Battle unfair skin.png|thumb|right|Example of an unfair skin in the skin selection menu]]
In competitive matches or in custom matches with the "Allow All Skins" setting turned off, certain player skins cannot be selected due to them being "unfair". These include skins of short, floating or transparent characters, skins without heads or arms, and skins that do not render worn armor. When joining a lobby or a game with unfair skins disabled, such skins are marked with a [[barrier]] icon in the skin selection menu. Players who had one of these skins equipped before joining Battle are changed to use one of the [[Default Skin Pack (Legacy Console Edition)|default skins]] instead. The value for setting a skin being unfair is the 1st bit in the <code>GAME_FLAGS</code> value that every skin has. Every skin flag value ending in an odd value is affected.

=== Loot ===
All loot in the Battle mini game is obtained from chests or other players. Center chests at the beginning of a round have multiple different saved combinations of items for different playing styles out of which 1 is randomly selected and it always generates with food in addition to that. Different regions of the maps have different types of loot. Some special, hard-to-reach chests can also have valuable loot. Every 30 seconds, loot is restocked in 4 randomly selected chests. Chests that have a player nearby have a lower chance to be refilled.{{info needed|How exactly does this system work? Does it reduce the chance for the chest to be selected or is there a chance for a chest which was selected to be not refilled when a player is nearby.}} On Small and Large maps there are two chests with valuable loot, and on Large+ there are four. On high power these chests usually have exclusive loot. [Potion/Arrow Effect Duration is not accurate]

== Maps ==
[[File:Battle mini game map legacy edition.png|thumb|Cove]]
As of TU49 and equivalent updates, there are a total of 21 maps in the Battle mini game (excluding the ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]''). The first three maps - Cavern, Cove, and Crucible - can be used by anyone, however the remaining 18 maps must be purchased through the respective Battle Map Pack or the Season Pass (excluding the ''Nintendo Switch Edition''). Each map is based on a theme, occasionally with unique music and a [[texture pack]]. Because of this, the texture pack cannot be changed during Battle mini game.

The Season Pass and nearly all DLC Battle maps are absent on the ''Nintendo Switch Edition'', even though all other versions, including the ''[[Wii U Edition]]'', have these maps as purchasable DLC. When asked about this during the Official Minecraft Livestream, it was stated that excluding ''Nintendo Switch Edition'' players from Battle Map DLC is "kind of intentional."<ref>[https://clips.twitch.tv/EnergeticCrispyCurlewOhMyDog] - The Official Minecraft Livestream</ref> This is currently still the case, where Valley is the only DLC Battle map that is available on the ''Nintendo Switch Edition'' through the purchase of the Chinese Mythology Mash-Up Pack.

The current available battle maps are as follows, with the ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' having access only to Cavern, Cove, Crucible, and Valley:

== Trivia ==
* The golden apple is more rare on High Power settings compared to Normal settings.
* If the spectating mode is set to Invisible, player's cameras can go though blocks. On the map Crucible, this can be used to view outside the map by going into third person.
* The music tracks for the three base maps of Battle (Cavern, Cove, and Crucible) were never officially released in full quality by [[C418]].
