'''16w33a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on August 17, 2016.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/1/www.mojang.com/2016/08/minecraft-snapshot-16w33a/</ref>

== Additions ==

=== Menu screen ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added "Should not be played while driving" and "You're going too fast!".

== Changes ==

=== Items ===
[[File:Shield JE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Shield]]s'''
* Now keep enchantments and durability when crafted with banners.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Some of elder guardians' and zombie villagers' subtitles are now distinct from the subtitles for guardians and zombies.

'''[[Smelting]]'''
* More things can be used as fuel:
** 1 [[wool]] smelts 0.5 items
** 1 [[carpet]] smelts 0.33 items, just less than {{frac|1|3}} items (increased in [[16w35a]])
** 1 [[ladder]] smelts 1.165 items, just less than {{frac|1|1|6}} items (increased in [[16w35a]])
** 1 [[wooden button]] smelts 0.5 items
** 1 [[bow]] smelts 1.5 items
** 1 [[fishing rod]] smelts 1.5 items
** 1 [[sign]] smelts 1 item
** 1 [[bowl]] smelts 0.5 items
** 1 [[wooden door]] smelts 1 item
** 1 [[boat]] smelts 2 items

=== Blocks ===
[[File:Cauldron JE7.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Cauldron]]s'''
* Can now be refilled with [[water bottle]]s.

[[File:Red Bed (N) JE1.png|width=46x46]] '''[[Bed]]s'''
* If the player clicks on the bed, but is not right beside it, it now shows a message:
** "You may not rest now, the bed is too far away"
** Previously the player would get no message, but would be unable to sleep.

[[File:White Banner JE1 BE1.png|width=50x50]] '''[[Banner]]s'''
* Now require a [[dye]] when applying a pattern that uses a non-dye item, such as a [[creeper head]] or [[enchanted golden apple]].
** Previously the lack of a dye would have applied the black variant of the pattern.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Farmer.png|width=50x50]] '''Farmer [[Villager]]s'''
* Now sells 5–7 [[apple]]s, where before they sold 5
* Now sells 6–10 [[cookie]]s, where before they sold 6

[[File:Elder Guardian JE1 BE1.png|width=61x61]] '''[[Elder Guardian|Elder Guardians]]'''
* Now drop a [[wet sponge]] rather than a dry sponge.
