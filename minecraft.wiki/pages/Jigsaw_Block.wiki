'''Jigsaw blocks''' are technical [[block]]s commonly used as a way to construct large structures from smaller sections.

== Obtaining ==
Jigsaw blocks can be obtained by using the {{control|pick block}} [[control]], or by using various [[commands]] such as {{cmd|give @s jigsaw}}. {{IN|Java}}, jigsaw blocks are also available in the [[Creative inventory]] when operator items is turned on.

{{IN|java}}, structure pieces of [[jigsaw structure]]s loaded using [[structure block]]s or {{cmd|place template}} include jigsaw blocks. Structures generated from clicking the "Generate" button in the Jigsaw block interface with the "Keep Jigsaw" setting turned on will also include jigsaw blocks.

{{IN|bedrock}}, structures placed using {{cmd|place jigsaw}} or {{cmd|place structure}} with <code>keepJigsaws</code> set to <code>true</code> include jigsaw blocks.

=== Natural generation ===
Jigsaw blocks do not naturally generate. Some [[structure]]s rely on jigsaw blocks for generation (e.g. [[pillager outpost]]s, [[village]]s, and [[ancient cities]]), but these jigsaw blocks are replaced by other blocks during generation.

== Usage ==
[[File:Jigsaw interface 1 20 3.png|thumb|250px|Jigsaw block interface in ''Java Edition'']]
[[File:BEJigsaw Interface.png|thumb|250px|Jigsaw block interface in ''Bedrock Edition'']]

Players in [[Survival]] mode cannot place jigsaw blocks.

=== Jigsaw connections ===
{{main|Jigsaw structure}}

Jigsaw blocks are function blocks used for the generation of [[jigsaw structure]]s out of smaller templates.<ref>{{cite|url=https://crowdin.com/translate/minecraft/9412/enus-engb#5201242|title=Minecraft Game}}</ref> Jigsaw structures are used for the generation of [[pillager outpost]]s, [[village]]s, [[bastion remnant]]s, [[Ancient City|ancient cities]], [[trail ruins]], and [[trial chambers]]; other structures use hardcoded generation. The GUI of a jigsaw block can be used to configure its generation settings. Those are:

; Target Pool
: Refers to a [[template pool]]; or an [[pool aliases|alias]] of a template pool. The template pool is used to select the connecting structure piece.

; Name
: Name of the jigsaw block.
: Defaults to {{code|minecraft:empty}}.

; Target name
: The desired name of the jigsaw block in the connecting piece to connect to this jigsaw block.
: Defaults to {{code|minecraft:empty}}.

; Turns into
: What the jigsaw block turns into once the whole feature is generated. 
: Defaults to <code>minecraft:air</code>.

; Selection Priority
: Defines the order of jigsaw blocks in a template to generate the connecting piece. If the piece being generated contains multiple jigsaw blocks that are all valid connections to the parent block, the game tries to connect to the one with the highest Selection Priority first. In the case of a tie, the connecting block is selected randomly.

; Placement Priority
: Defines the order of in which the connecting piece is processed to handle its jigsaw blocks during the wider structure generation.

; Joint type
: Appears only when jigsaw block is placed facing up or down.
: Contains two types of joints: Rollable and Aligned
:* Rollable: The connecting piece is placed with a random rotation. Defaults to this.
:* Aligned: The connecting piece is rotated such that the rotations of the jigsaw blocks match (marked by the white bar on the jigsaw block)

=== Debug generation ===
{{see also|Commands/place}}
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Jigsaw blocks can also be used to generate multiple levels of jigsaw blocks in the world. The settings in the 2nd to last row are only used for this purpose and are not saved when leaving the UI.

; Levels
: Determines how many jigsaw block "levels" it goes through. (ex. Piece>[Layer 1]>[Layer 2]).
: Can be set to an integer from 0 to 20. Defaults to 0.

; Keep Jigsaw
: Determines if the placed pieces includes the jigsaw blocks it contains or become what its "Turns into" field is set to.
: Defaults to ON

; Generate
: The button to start the generation.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Jigsaw blocks cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

=== Block data ===
A jigsaw block has a [[block entity]] associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

{{el|java}}:
{{see also|Block entity format}}
<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
** {{nbt|string|final_state}}: The block that this jigsaw block becomes.
** {{nbt|string|joint}}: The joint option value, either "rollable" or "aligned".
** {{nbt|string|name}}: The jigsaw block's name. This jigsaw block gets aligned with another structure's jigsaw block that has this value in the target tag.
** {{nbt|string|pool}}: The jigsaw block's target pool to select a structure from.
** {{nbt|string|target}}: The jigsaw block's target name. This jigsaw block gets aligned with another structure's jigsaw block that has this value in the name tag.
** {{nbt|int|selection_priority}}: Priority of this jigsaw block being selected for generation. Jigsaw blocks with higher selection priority get selected first.
** {{nbt|int|placement_priority}}: Priority of the piece generated by this jigsaw block to place its children. Pieces with higher placement priority generate their children first.
