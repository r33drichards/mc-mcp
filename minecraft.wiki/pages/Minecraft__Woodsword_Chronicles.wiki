{{q|So I’m a writer living in New York. I actually moved from Florida to New York to work in children’s publishing as an editor, and I did that for a good twelve or thirteen years before transitioning to writing full time. I’ve got a lot of different projects in addition to the Minecraft books – I’m also writing a fantasy series, which I’m co-writing with my best friend, and I’m the writer and narrative designer for a small video game studio based in Seattle. I’m a big gamer as well as a big reader and writer, so the Minecraft gig is a super-exciting one for me!|Nick Eliopulos, author of ''Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles''<ref>{{Mcnet|new-books--woodsword-chronicles|New Books: Woodsword Chronicles|May 15, 2019}}</ref>}}
