The '''TU69 tutorial world''' is the eighth and final distinct tutorial for the {{LCE}} of the game, released on all platforms that received the [[Update Aquatic]].

== Areas ==
=== Spawn ===
[[File:TU69 tutorial spawn.png|thumb|The area the player spawns in]]
When creating a new tutorial world, the player will always spawn in this enclosed area. They are given tutorial pop-ups that can be skipped or progressed through. There is a partially built house, made of [[oak planks]]. At the back, there is a tunnel with stairs that appears to be caved in. Towards the front, there is a broken bridge that, when either rebuilt or traversed around, leads to a room with a bridge suspended over water, with creeper faces made of [[dark prismarine]] on either side. The bridge leads to a stairway that brings the player out into the main tutorial area, greeted by a giant stone ''Minecraft'' logo above head.

=== Tutorial areas ===
==== Farming (crops) ====
Just past the big ''Minecraft'' logo there is a farm that contains every [[crop]]. Inside this fenced in farm is a chest that contains the following:
*{{ItemLink|Seeds|Wheat Seeds}} x5
*{{ItemLink|Melon Seeds}} x5
*{{ItemLink|Pumpkin Seeds}} x5
*{{ItemLink|Beetroot Seeds}} x5
*{{ItemLink|Carrot}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Potato}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Stone Hoe}}
*{{ItemLink|Bone Meal}} x10
The farm area to the right of the chest has some untilled grass, and farmland with nothing planted on it, for use in the tutorial.

==== Trading ====
Directly after the farm there are two more fenced areas, with the one on the right being for [[trading]]. There are 3 houses that somewhat resemble the village houses of the time. Inside the biggest house there are two [[villager]]s behind a counter, and there are two more who can roam freely within the fenced area. There is a butcher, an armorer, a cleric, and a librarian. There is a chest containing 32 [[paper]] and 11 [[emerald]]s. 

==== Repairing ====
Across from the trading pen is another fenced area containing a blacksmith-style building and an [[anvil]]. There are two villagers, a weapon smith and a tool smith. There is a chest containing the following:
*{{ItemLink|Wooden Pickaxe}} with low [[durability]] 
*{{ItemLink|Golden Shovel}} with even lower durability
*{{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}} with almost full durability
*{{ItemLink|Iron Ingot}}
*{{ItemLink|Gold Ingot}}
*{{ItemLink|Stone Sword}}
*{{ItemLink|Enchanted Book}} with [[Fire Aspect]] II
*{{ItemLink|Bottle o' Enchanting}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Name Tag}} x5
*{{ItemLink|Lava Bucket}}

==== Farming (animals) ====
To the left of the farming and repairing areas is a stable containing pens of [[chicken]]s, [[cow]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[wolves]], and [[ocelot]]s. In the middle there is a chest containing the following:
*{{ItemLink|Wheat}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Wheat Seeds|Seeds}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Carrot}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Raw Beef}} x5
*{{ItemLink|Raw Cod}} x10
*{{ItemLink|Bone}} x10
These items are to be used to [[breed]] and [[tame]] the penned animals.
