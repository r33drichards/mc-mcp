The '''''Minecraft: Mobestiary''''' is a ''Minecraft'' book authored by Alex Wiltshire and illustrated by Anton Stenvall. In the book, a character known as the Naturalist explains how each mob works in detail according to his perspective in the Minecraft world. Most of the writing focuses on the in-game mechanics of each mob, but it occasionally references things from outside the game, such as the [[Rabbit#The Killer Bunny|killer bunny]] being "immortalized in a popular comedic play", [[TNT]] in the anatomy of a [[creeper]], the superstition of the [[chicken]] being a spy, and the origins of [[endermites]] being from between dimensions. There are also dissections of some of the mobs showing organs, bones, gas, magma, gears, and/or [[redstone]] depending on the mob.

== Trivia ==
*The sketch showing the anatomy of the creeper was likely based on official Minecraft merchandise created by JINX.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.jinx.com/p/minecraft_creeper_anatomy_premium_tee.html?catid=|title=Minecraft Creeper Anatomy Premium Tee|author=J!NX|website=jinx.com|date=June 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630014033/http://www.jinx.com/p/minecraft_creeper_anatomy_premium_tee.html?catid=}}</ref>
**In [[Minecraft Dungeons]], there is an anatomical model showing the same anatomy.
**Even though the two sources mentioned above and more show creepers to have [[TNT]] inside their body, the official Brickheadz Lego set shows a creeper having a TNT in its head.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3hqxdUEwuI&t=164s</ref>
*The spy-chicken superstition mentioned by the Naturalist originated from a ''Minecraft'' [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] tutorial video made by Paul Soares Jr.<ref>{{YouTube link|I5EC5ymLWHs|Minecraft Tutorials - 14 - How to Survive & Thrive (Death & Compass)|paulsoaresjr|October 8, 2010}}</ref>
**In the beginning of the video, Paul was in a cave along with a chicken that seemed to watch him. Though he never mentioned it being a spy in the video itself, he jokingly stated in several comments on the video that the chicken was a spy sent by {{w|Saruman}} and that it had to be executed.
*Several pieces of artwork from the book were auctioned off as part of a charity event.<ref>{{Mcnet|buy-minecraft-art-help-charity|Buy Minecraft Art, Help Charity|October 17, 2017|Marsh Davies|20110630014033}}</ref>
