A '''dandelion ''' is a [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[yellow dye]], [[suspicious stew]], and used to breed [[rabbit]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A dandelion can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A dandelion also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Dandelion|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Dandelions generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in the following biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features:

{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{BiomeLink|Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Sunflower Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Savanna}}
* {{BiomeLink|Savanna Plateau}}

* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Gravelly Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|River}}
* {{BiomeLink|Frozen River}}
}}

The following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate dandelions, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, dandelions can generate only in edge cases or [[custom]] worlds.

In [[jungle]]s, [[bamboo jungle]]s, [[sparse jungle]]s, [[savanna]]s and [[savanna plateau]]s, dandelions are twice as common as in other biomes. In [[flower forest]]s and [[meadow]]s, dandelions only generate as part of [[Flower#Flower gradients|gradients]].

Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna [[village]]s. Potted dandelions can also generate in [[woodland mansion]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

==== {{JE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed [[#Natural generation|above]] (except those marked as {{only|bedrock}}), dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, dandelions can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

==== {{BE}} ====
When bone meal is applied to a grass block in any biome except [[swamp]], [[pale garden]], and [[flower forest]], dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. Unlike {{JE}}, bone meal can generate dandelions anywhere within a meadow biome. In plains and sunflower plains, dandelions cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a dandelion in any biome, more dandelions appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Poppies can also occasionally appear, and dandelions can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Endermen]] can pick up dandelions, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|dandelion}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell a dandelion for 1 emerald.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, dandelions can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Dandelions can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a dandelion imparts the [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]] effect for 0.35 seconds {{in|java}} or 0.3 seconds {{in|bedrock}}. The Saturation effect restores an additional {{hunger|7}} hunger and 14 saturation {{in|java}}, or {{hunger|6}} hunger and 12 saturation {{in|bedrock}}. The suspicious stew can be crafted using a dandelion or produced by feeding a dandelion to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with dandelions, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding===
Dandelions can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s and [[rabbit]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a dandelion have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a dandelion into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of dandelions yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

* In real life, a dandelion is any member of the [[wikipedia:Taraxacum|''Taraxacum'']] genus of flowering plants.
* When [[Notch]] made the dandelion (the texture in the [[Programmer Art]] pack), he used the [[rose]] as a base for its texture.
