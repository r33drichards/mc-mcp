If the cartographer is in [[the Nether]] or [[the End]], either spawned or transported, the trades for the map do not unlock. If the world does not generate a particular structure, trades for the map for that structure also do not unlock.

{{IN|JE}}, each cartographer sells its own unique explorer map that points to a different location than other cartographers. Purchasing another explorer map from the same cartographer results in the same explorer map. Unlike {{BE}}, maps from Java Cartographers do not necessarily point to the nearest structure of the type indicated. {{IN|BE}}, a cartographer sells explorer maps that point to the nearest location, regardless of whether it has been previously mapped by another cartographer. 

<!--
New instances of old worlds cannot be created through the game's world creation menu, but existing old worlds can still be played.
Therefore, this paragraph is still relevant to the most recent version of the game.
-->
{{IN|BE}}, if cartographer map trades are unlocked in an [[old world]], the game stops ticking.

=== Generated loot ===
In contrast to explorer maps, '''buried treasure maps''' (''Java Edition'') or '''treasure maps''' (''Bedrock Edition'') generate in ocean ruins or in shipwrecks.
{{LootChestItem|buried-treasure-map}}

== Usage ==
[[File:Explorer Map Comparison.gif|thumb|217px|Unexplored and partially explored woodland explorer maps.]]

{{See also|Map#Mapping|Map#Map content}}

=== Locating structures ===
An explorer map shows a section of terrain that contains a specific [[structure]], marked with a small icon. The structure shown may not be the nearest such structure to the [[player]]. An explorer map differs from a normal map in that it shows the area's land-water outline, with an orange striated texture for water and swamps,<ref>Specifically, biomes in the <code>water_on_map_outlines</code> [[biome tag]].</ref> and the blank map texture for land.

If the player icon is smaller than it would be on a normal map, that means the player is a great distance away. When the player is less than 1027 blocks away from the map border, the icon returns to the proper size. When the player reaches the map's area of land (512×512), the map fills in like a normal map.

The basic functions of a [[buried treasure]] explorer map are similar to that of the others. However, instead of showing a structure icon on the map, the treasure's location is marked with a red X. The buried treasure chest is located on the same X and Z coordinates as the middle of the X (the player marker may need to be aligned with the bottom of the middle 2×2 pixel square of the X). To locate the [[chest]] spot, hold the treasure map in the hotbar, not in the offhand slot. It is possible for multiple maps to point to the same treasure or structure, since explorer maps lead to the closest location (relative to where they were created) of their target type.

The parts of the world that have already been explored and mapped are copied, and newly explored areas appear on both instances. In Creative mode, cloned explorer maps can be obtained by pick blocking on the explorer map displayed on [[item frame]]s (the map needs to be out of the [[player]]'s inventory when using pick block, or else that map moves into the active hotbar slot).

An explorer map differs from a [[map]] in that its <code>map_color</code> and <code>item_name</code> components are set. Additionally, its <code>map_decorations</code> component includes an entry for its target structure. Its [[Map item format#map_<#>.dat format|map item entry]] is identical to that of a normal map, except that by the time the player sees it, its <code>colors</code> byte array is pre-filled with explorer maps' characteristic land-water boundary lines and water shading.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Explorer maps fill as the [[chunk]]s are generated, rather than when the [[player]] holds them while in the area; leaving an explorer map while exploring the area still fills the map.
* {{IN|Bedrock}}, inventory editors and add-ons can be used to create Explorer Maps that lead to any structure.
