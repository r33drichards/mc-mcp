A '''mushroom''' is a variety of fungus that grows and spreads in dark areas. Mushrooms generate as [[Red Mushroom|red]] or [[Brown Mushroom|brown]] in color, and small or [[Huge mushroom|huge]] in size.

== Variants ==
There are two mushroom variants:
*{{BlockLink|Red Mushroom}}
*{{BlockLink|Brown Mushroom}}

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Mushrooms can be [[instant mining|instantly mined]] with any tool, including by hand. Mining a huge [[mushroom block]] drops up to 2 mushrooms of the same color. [[Fortune]] does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.<ref>{{bug|MC-156657||Fortune doesn't work on mushroom blocks|Invalid}}</ref>

A mushroom also breaks instantly and drops as an item if:
* the block below it is moved or destroyed
* a [[fluid]] flows over it
* a block next to it changes state, but only when it is ''not'' on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], or [[nylium]] and light level is 13 or higher
{{breaking row|Mushrooms|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Mushrooms naturally generate in poorly lit areas ([[light level]] of 12 or less). If this condition is met, each [[chunk]] has {{frac|1|8}} (12.5%) chance to generate red mushroom and {{frac|1|4}} (25.0%) chance to generate brown mushroom, in the form of [[random patch]]es.<ref>{{IN|java}}, due to {{bug|MC-244162}}, they generate 64 times less often than intended and only on the surface.</ref>

Mushrooms also generate on the surface of a [[swamp]], [[old growth spruce taiga]], [[old growth pine taiga]], or [[mushroom fields]] biome, along with anywhere in [[the Nether]]. Unlike plants, they are able to generate on top of nearly any block type.

{{IN|java}}, they are commonly found in patches on the [[Nether roof]], and are the only blocks that can generate there. 

[[Witch hut]]s have a [[flower pot]] with a red mushroom inside. Mushrooms also generate inside "mushroom farm" rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s.

Red mushrooms planted on [[podzol]] can also be found around [[bogged]] and [[cave spider]] [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]]. 

==== Fallen trees ====
[[Fallen tree]]s can have up to 2 mushrooms generated on them.

{{block distribution}}

=== Huge mushrooms ===
Mining a [[huge mushroom]] of either color has a chance of dropping a mushroom of the same color, for each block mined.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Shear]]ing a red or brown [[mooshroom]] drops 5 mushrooms of the corresponding color and permanently turns it into a normal [[cow]].

Shearing a [[bogged]] drops 2 mushrooms, which could be 2 brown mushrooms, 2 red mushrooms or one of each.

An [[enderman]] holding a mushroom drops it upon death.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 3 mushrooms of either color for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources|Brown Mushroom|Red Mushroom}}

== Usage ==
=== Planting ===
Mushrooms can be planted and grown on blocks that have a full top surface in [[light]] levels below 13 and not directly underneath the sky. They cannot be planted on the top surfaces of [[slab]]s or [[stairs]].<ref>{{bug|MC-146825}}</ref> For more information, see [[Opacity/Placement]]. If planted on [[mycelium]], [[podzol]] or [[nylium]], they can stay planted in any light level, including skylight. Both brown and red mushrooms grow at the same rate regardless of the light level.<ref name="Fully-Automated Tests of Mushroom Growth at Different Light Levels Using BUD Switch Harvester">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ALkf-b7MbBI&t=864s</ref><ref name="Large scale automated test with additional info">{{ytl|J7AmGnpMCng}}</ref>

=== Huge mushrooms ===
{{main|Huge mushroom#Growth}}
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a mushroom, the mushroom has a chance to grow into a [[huge mushroom]] of the same color, provided that it is on a proper block ([[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]], or [[pale moss block]] at a light level of 12 or below; on [[podzol]], [[mycelium]] or [[nylium]] at any light level) and is free of [[solid block]]s within 5 blocks ''directly'' above the mushroom.

=== Spread ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Mushroom farming}}

When receiving a [[random tick]], a mushroom has a 4% chance of spreading to a nearby block (including even above and below diagonally) if there are fewer than five mushrooms of the same type in a 9×9×3 volume around the original mushroom.

=== Decoration ===
Either type of mushroom can be planted in a [[flower pot]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Red Mushroom,Brown Mushroom}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a mushroom into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
