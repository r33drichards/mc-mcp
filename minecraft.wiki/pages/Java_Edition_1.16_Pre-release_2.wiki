'''1.16 Pre-release 2''' (known as '''1.16-pre2''' in the [[launcher]]) is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on June 5, 2020,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-16-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.16 Pre-Release 2|June 5, 2020}}</ref> which fixes some critical bugs from the previous pre-release.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''Floating Islands'''
* [[Guardian]]s and [[pillager]]s now spawn correctly in floating islands worlds.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* "Jellie" [[cat]]s now spawn naturally in villages.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Entering the world in an unknown dimension (caused by disabling a [[data pack]] which added said [[dimension]]) now puts the player in the [[Overworld]] at the same coordinates.
