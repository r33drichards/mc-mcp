'''18w22a''' is the fortieth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on May 29, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w22a|May 29, 2018}}</ref>.

== Changes ==
=== [[Block]]s ===
'''[[Leaves]] '''
* '''Version exclusive''': Naturally-generated leaves now survive at a distance of up to 6 blocks from logs, instead of 4.
** The block state for leaves changed from a <code>check_decay</code> and <code>decayable</code> booleans to <code>distance</code> (ranging from 1 to 7) and a <code>persistent</code> boolean.

'''[[Turtle egg]]s and [[sea pickle]]s'''
* Adding one more to an existing stack fails if it would cause a player to be inside their hitbox.
* Now makes placement sounds when the amount in a stack is increased.
* Can place more in a stack by aiming at adjacent blocks.
* Right-clicking no longer animates the hand.
* Sea pickles now require a supporting block.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Drowned]] '''
* Now have a swimming animation.

=== Textures ===
* Changed the [[tropical fish bucket]] texture from [[File:Bucket of Tropical Fish JE1 BE1.png|32px]] to [[File:Bucket of Tropical Fish JE2.png|32px]].
* Changed the creamy [[horse]]'s texture.
* Changed the texture of [[iron horse armor]] when equipped.
