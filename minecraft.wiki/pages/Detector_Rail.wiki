The '''detector rail''' is a type of [[rail]] that produces a [[redstone]] signal while a [[minecart]] is on it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break detector rail is [[pickaxe]].

Detector rail drops itself when it's destroyed.

== Usage ==
To place a detector rail, {{control|use}} a detector rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the detector rail should occupy.

A detector rail can be placed on top of any block whose top face has a rim around the edge, such as any [[full block]], [[hopper]], top [[Slab#Placement|slab]], upside-down [[Stairs#Placement|stairs]], or top [[Trapdoor#Properties|trapdoor]]. A full list of compatible blocks can be found [https://joakimthorsen.github.io/MCPropertyEncyclopedia/?selection=variants,top_face_has_rim&filter=(top_face_has_rim:No)# here].

If a detector rail is [[Block update|updated]] while on an opened top trapdoor, the rail breaks drops as an item. Placing a minecart on a detector rail on top of a closed and unpowered trapdoor opens the trapdoor and updates the rail, causing the detector rail to break. If the top trapdoor is powered and closed when the minecart is placed, the trapdoor does not open so the rail does not break. The minecart on the detector rail then powers the trapdoor, meaning the external power source can be removed without causing the trapdoor to change state and break the rail.

When placed, a detector rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent [[rail]]s (including [[activator rail]]s, [[powered rail]]s, and other [[detector rail]]s), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the detector rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a detector rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a detector rail "prefers", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.

[[Mob]]s avoid walking across a detector rail (or other rails), but can be pushed onto them.

It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.<ref>{{bug|MC-182709|||Invalid}}</ref>

=== Rail ===
{{main|Rail}}

Detector rails (and other rails) act as "roads" for [[minecart]]s. A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from either end of the detector rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with [[powered rail]]s). A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the detector rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted detector rail.

=== Redstone component ===
[[File:Comparitor signal strength minecart.png|thumb|Example for signal strength of a full minecart (right) and a half-full one (left)]]
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A detector rail becomes [[Detector Rail#Block states|powered]] when any part of any minecart's [[bounding box]] comes into contact with it. Every 20th [[Tick|game tick]] after the rail first becomes powered, it checks whether any minecart is still present and depowers if there are none in contact at that time. This means that the duration of the signal is always a multiple of 20 game ticks (10 redstone ticks). While powered, a detector rail:
* sets adjacent '''[[redstone dust]]''' to [[power level]] 15 
* activates adjacent '''[[redstone repeater]]s''' facing away from the detector rail
* activates adjacent '''[[redstone comparator]]s''' facing away from the detector rail to a level corresponding to the fullness of the minecart if it is a [[Minecart with Chest|minecart with chest]] or a [[Minecart with Hopper|minecart with hopper]]
* strongly powers the block supporting the detector rail if that block is [[conductive]]
* activates any adjacent '''[[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]]''', including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, [[powered rail]]s, [[hopper]]s, etc.

[[File:Detector-comparator-diff.png|thumbnail|right|Comparators give a signal for a minecart with chest or a minecart with hopper]]
If the minecart on the detector rail is a [[minecart with chest]] or [[minecart with hopper]], an adjacent redstone comparator facing away from the detector rail outputs a power level proportional to the [[Redstone Comparator#Measure block state|container's fullness]], possibly power level 0. For any other type of minecart (including a regular minecart with a mob riding it) the comparator's output is zero.

A comparator can read the contents of a minecart with hopper or with chest on a detector rail through a solid opaque block, as it can with other container blocks.

=== Mob interaction ===
Like other types of rails, [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[warden]]s are the only land mobs that can walk onto detector rails.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Detector rail can be pushed by the [[piston]], and can be pulled by the [[sticky piston]]. However, detector rail breaks and drops as an item when it is unsupported because of being moved.
