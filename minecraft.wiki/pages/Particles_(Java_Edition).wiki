'''Particles''' are special graphical effects in ''Minecraft'' that are created when certain events occur, such as [[explosion]]s, [[rainfall]], or [[smelting]] items in a [[furnace]].

== Behavior ==

Particles are rendered as front-facing 2D sprites, meaning they always face the [[player]]. They disappear after a short animation, in which they may change sizes and rotate, and cycle between a number of animation sprites. They collide with solid [[block]]s and are slowed by [[cobweb]]s, but are unaffected by other [[entity|entities]].{{verify|most particles usually phase through blocks except for some, like smoke particles from campfire}}

Particles generate in a spherical area around the player with a radius of 32 blocks. (Except campfire smoke and firework particles, which generates in any loaded chunk.) The {{cmd|particle}} command can be used to create particles.

If a player uses the "minimal" particles option in the [[video settings]], some particles may not appear.

== Trivia ==
*Most particle textures can be changed using resource packs, however, particle colors that are applied to the texture files such as those for smoke particles used in [[redstone]], portals, and [[endermen]] cannot be changed without mods.
**The {{code|dust}} particle has unique syntax used for color, represented with three RGB values as decimal percentages.
*Status effect particles appear where the player face is pointing.
*The {{code|elder_guardian}} particle always follows the player regardless of what its location has been set to.
*[[Redstone repeater]]s emit particles, but [[redstone comparator]]s do not.	
*There is a particle that is internally used to implement the item pickup animation, but it cannot be summoned with the {{cmd|particle}} command. Before the name was removed in [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], it was called {{code|take}}.
*There is a limit of 16384 particles existing at the same time.
*The {{code|trail}} particles use colours {{code|#FC7812}} and {{code|#5F5F5F}} when created naturally by a [[creaking heart]].
