[[File:Five.ogg]]

"5" begins with static and a warped noise. After a moment of silence, there is the sound of a [[Flint and Steel|flint and steel]] lighting, [[fire]], a [[bat]], and then walking. The walking becomes heavier and metallic. The sound stops with sounds of breathing followed by a roar, which warps into soft, relaxing music. The music soon transitions back to the sound of footsteps, followed by [[lava]] bubbling and [[Block of Amethyst|amethyst]]. A warped noise and a [[sculk shrieker]] can be heard activating. There is then a coughing sound, some metallic and stone and sand sounds, and another warped noise.

Then, after a moment of silence, a heartbeat begins with rising static in the background. There are then sounds of [[deepslate]], along with strange noises building up and abruptly stopping. A crescendo of overlapping warped sounds is followed then dies down. The footsteps begin again, but much quieter than before. A [[sculk sensor]] then clicks, and a [[warden]] roars. The warden's roar warps and slows down, and then the disc ends.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "5" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "5", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 15.
