== Synopsis ==

The [[Overworld]] is in trouble. On the ground, a rampaging army of armor-clad [[Zombie|zombies]] is roving across the [[Biome|biomes]]. In the sky, a wicked [[Wither]] is leaving a path of destruction—and [[Wither Rose|Wither roses]]—wherever it goes.

And in [[Bobbie]]’s party, the tension is tighter than a [[skeleton]]’s [[String|bowstring]]… because, somehow, [[Logan]] just became its newest member. The same Logan who set zombies on Bobbie’s [[Plaintown|village]] and turned her little brother, [[Johnny (character)|Johnny]], into one of the walking dead. Who bullied her friend [[Ben]] and wrecked his adventuring career. Who was mean to his minion, [[Benjamin|Other Ben]] (who prefers Benjamin, actually). But as the Wither skulls start flying, this not-so-merry band needs all the help it can get.

Bobbie hasn’t forgotten her main mission: Find the [[Zombie Villager|zombified villagers]] who were once her friends and family and feed them the [[Enchanted Golden Apple|enchanted golden apples]] that will turn them back. But as long as the Wither exists, there’s danger. And if there’s danger, it’s a hero’s job to fix it. As much as Bobbie dislikes heroes, she and her friends (and also Logan) look like the closest thing the Overworld’s got.<ref name=MCZombiesU/>
