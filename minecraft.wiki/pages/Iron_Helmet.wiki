An '''iron helmet''' is a variant of [[helmet]] that is crafted from [[iron ingots]]. It is the fifth-highest [[tier]] of helmet, having the same armor points as a [[copper helmet]] but with higher durability.

=== Natural generation ===
Two [[armor stand]]s are found in each taiga [[village]] outdoor armory, one of them equipped with an [[iron helmet]].

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|iron-helmet,level-enchanted-iron-helmet}}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include an iron helmet. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[vindicator]]s and [[pillager]]s spawned in [[raid]]s have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop an iron helmet. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and has a 50% chance of being enchanted with a random enchantment.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
When worn, an iron helmet provides {{armor|2}} [[armor points]].

An iron helmet can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
An iron helmet can receive the following [[enchantment]]s. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher [[enchantability]] than iron or diamond.

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], an iron helmet, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
