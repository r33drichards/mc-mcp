A '''powerful potato''' is a [[block]] which can be found in the [[Potato dimension]] in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Powerful potatoes can be broken with any tool, and always drop themselves.
{{Breaking row|horizontal=1|Powerful Potato|Any}}

=== Natural generation ===
Powerful potatoes generate rarely in the [[wasteland]] biome, in Potato dimension. They drop when broken with any tool or by hand.

== Usage ==
=== Growing ===
A powerful potato grows in a similar way to the [[chorus tree]], but downward. Naturally found powerful potatoes have the <code>age</code> parameter set to 3, and a number of [[weak roots]] growing down from the block into the terrain of Potato dimension. They don't grow further.

When mined and replaced, the <code>age</code> parameter is reset to 0. Every time the block receives a random tick, it attempts to grow [[strong roots]] instead of weak roots - both downward and to the sides. Each time it successfully grows a strong root, its <code>age</code> grows by one, and when it reaches 3, powerful potato stops growing more roots from itself (note: the <code>age</code> can be seen in the [[debug menu]] when targeting the block, but it doesn't update properly). This, however, does not stop already existing branches from growing further. Process doesn't ever end by itself: infinite growth can be stopped only by destroying the powerful potato block.

Any block that is replaced by the strong roots is dropped on top of the powerful potato. For more information on how roots behave, see [[strong roots]] page.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Powerful potatoes are destroyed when pushed by [[piston]]s. They do not stick to sticky pistons, [[slime block]]s or [[honey block]]s.

== Issues ==
Powerful potato is an unsupported block due to being an [[Wikipedia:April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke; therefore, related issues are not expected to be fixed.
