'''Dirt paths''' are decorative blocks. They are mainly found in [[village]]s as a path for the villagers.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A [[shovel]] is the most efficient [[tool]] for mining dirt paths.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, a dirt path block can be directly obtained with a [[Silk Touch]] tool.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-10482}}</ref>

{{IN|Java}}, dirt paths always drop [[dirt]] when broken. Dirt path blocks can be obtained only via the [[Creative inventory]], [[commands]], or {{control|pick block}}. They can still be created from placed dirt, however, by {{control|using}} a [[shovel]] on dirt, as described in {{Section link||Post-generation}} below.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Dirt Path|Shovel|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Dirt paths are naturally generated in [[village]]s when pathways replace [[grass block]]s.
Their purpose is aesthetics, and additionally {{in|Bedrock}}, [[Villager#Preferred path|pathfinding]] for villagers. Most dirt paths connect to village structures and houses.

Dirt paths also generate as part of some village structures.

Although they can't be placed that way by the player, village generation can cause them to appear under other blocks.

=== Post-generation ===
Dirt paths can be created by {{control|using}} any type of [[shovel]] on the side or top of [[dirt]], [[grass block]], [[coarse dirt]], [[mycelium]], [[podzol]], or [[rooted dirt]] that has air above it. The shovel then loses one [[durability]].

== Usage ==
Dirt paths are primarily used for decoration, although they also prevent hostile mobs from spawning. They are a similar color to grass blocks placed in a desert or savanna biome. They are only {{frac|15|16}} of a block high, therefore items that require a full block like [[torch]]es and [[button]]s cannot be placed on them. [[Villager]]s and [[iron golem]]s prefer to use dirt paths the most when routing compared to any other block.{{only|be}}

A dirt path block converts to dirt instantly if a block with a solid [[material]] is placed on top of it.

Using a [[hoe]] on dirt path converts it to [[farmland]]. Since dirt paths can be created with any variant of dirt, it can be used as an intermediate step to convert [[podzol]] and [[mycelium]], which cannot be tilled directly, into farmland.

{{IN|BE}}, using a [[flint and steel]] on a dirt path places [[fire]] on it. Doing this does not convert the path to dirt.

== Trivia ==
* If aimed correctly, an [[arrow]] can fly past the gap between a [[block]] and a dirt path placed below using [[commands]].
* The idea of dirt paths came from [http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2sqwu6/i_made_a_road_simple_yet_so_much_nicer_than/ a suggestion post in /r/Minecraft].<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|557538265419759616|Popular suggestion by /u/LupusX added, ... also for MC:PE|January 20, 2015}}</ref>
