The '''mega spud''' is a joke [[boss mob]] found in [[colosseum]]s in [[24w14potato]].

== Spawning ==
One mega spud spawns in each [[colosseum]] upon [[World generation|generation]]. If it can, the mega spud always stays in proximity to the place it spawned at.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Mega spud drops [[Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant]] and {{xp|50}} xp when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. It is crucial to remember this during the final stages of the battle, as mega spud can inflict damage on itself with its own attacks. Therefore, the player must ensure that they are the one to deliver the finishing blow.

== Behavior ==
Mega spud moves around similarly to a [[slime]]. When it detects a player, mega spud starts shooting [[fireball]]s at them. This fireball is stronger than that of a [[ghast]]: it has an <code>explosionPower</code> of 2, and can destroy [[stone]]-like [[block]]s, which ghast's fireball cannot.

Besides fireballs, mega spud also uses a melee attack, which deals {{hp|2}} damage on Easy and Normal, and {{hp|3}} on Hard.

Mega spud has 10 phases, plus the initial "zeroth" phase. When damaged for the first time, it instantly switches to the first phase, but its health remains the same. Each next phase requires dealing {{hp|102.4}} points of [[damage]] to the mega spud, but it can receive a maximum of {{hp|100}} damage at once, no matter what weapon or buffs are used.

Whenever a new phase begins, mega spud performs the following actions:
* Creates a shield around itself, similar to the [[wither]]'s armor, and becomes invulnerable to all forms of damage, except for [[void]] damage and the {{cmd|kill}} command.
** During this shielded state, any mobs that are engaged in combat with mega spud typically cease their attack. Even if the mobs are then directly attacked by mega spud, there is no retaliation.
** There are occasions where the mobs do ''not'' cease their attack. In such cases, the mobs can inflict damage on mega spud as per usual, without the repercussion of having the damage reflected back at them, as is the case for players. It is unclear how or why this occurs, but it is likely to be a glitch.
* Shrinks by about half a block, and gets slightly faster.
* Drops a number of [[corrupted potato peels]].
** On average, in each next phase it drops less peels, but always drops at least one.
* Spawns minions. Number of minions is equal to the number of the started phase. Each next phase has a stronger mob as a minion.
** Minions are spawned in a 8×4×8 box around the spot that the mega spud spawned in. This mechanic uses the same particles and sounds as [[trial spawner]]s.
* Changes name, as seen on top of the bossbar.
** This action is not always carried out properly, and sometimes mega spud changes its name too early.

While in the invulnerable state, mega spud reflects every attack that the player does back at them. This is different from how the [[Thorns]] enchantment work, because mega spud reflects 100% of the incoming damage: for example, shooting the boss with a bow with [[Power]] V can instantly kill an unarmored player. Attempting to damage the boss in this state also causes all of its minions to gain the [[Glowing]] effect for 10 seconds, which indicates that minions must be defeated first.

If the player dies, current phase is reset, and a new set of minions is spawned.

When all minions from a given phase are killed or moved to unloaded chunks, mega spud roars angrily and loses its shield. It can then be damaged like a normal mob. Unlike the [[wither]] or the [[ender dragon]], mega spud is ''not'' immune to [[status effect]]s, [[fire]], [[suffocation]] or [[drowning]].

{{Reflist}}

Adding the 1024 points of boss health to combined health of all mobs that mega spud spawns, player must deal 3546 points of damage in order to defeat the boss.

Mega spud can enter [[minecart]]s, and from phase eight it can also enter [[boat]]s. A [[fishing rod]] can pull the mega spud.

Besides the player, mega spud is also aggressive to [[iron golem]]s, [[villager]]s, and [[wandering trader]]s.

=== Peaceful difficulty ===
On [[Peaceful]], the mega spud does not despawn, but is harmless to the player. Any minions beyond phase 2 despawn immediately, so mega spud loses its shield quickly after gaining it.

== Sounds ==
Mega spuds use the Hostile Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].
