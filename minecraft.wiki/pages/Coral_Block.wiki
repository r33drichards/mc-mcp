A '''coral block''' is a solid block that comes in five variants: tube, brain, bubble, fire, and horn.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Coral blocks can be obtained only with a pickaxe enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]; if mined with a pickaxe not enchanted with Silk Touch, they drop the respective [[dead coral block]].
{{breaking row|sprite=Coral Blocks|Coral Block|Pickaxe|Wood|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Coral blocks naturally generate in [[coral reef]] structures, which can be found in [[warm ocean]]s.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 of any coral block for 3 [[emerald]]s.

}}|Schematic of valid block placements for coral blocks with water around. Several ways are shown where the arrangement would cause coral blocks to stay alive or die.}}
Coral blocks can be used for building or as decoration blocks.

=== Placement ===
In order for a coral block to stay alive, at least one of the six directly adjacent blocks must be [[water]] or a [[waterlogging|waterlogged block]]. If placed outside of water, it transforms into its respective [[dead coral block]] after 3 to 4.95 seconds{{only|JE}} or 2.25 seconds{{only|BE}} &mdash; a grayscale version of the coral block. A coral block still dies if the [[game rule]] <code>randomTickSpeed</code> is set to {{cd|0}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-129942|||Invalid}}</ref> Once a coral block dies, it is not possible to turn a dead coral block into a live coral block.

{{IN|BE}}, coral blocks do not die if they are surrounded by any non-air blocks.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-62394}}</ref>

=== Sea pickle farm blocks ===
If [[sea pickle]]s are planted on live coral blocks, using [[bone meal]] on the sea pickles increases the number of sea pickles and creates more sea pickles on nearby coral blocks. Specifically, they can spread to the original sea pickle's level or one level below, out to a horizontal [[taxicab distance]] of 2. This only works on living coral blocks, not dead coral blocks.

=== Note Blocks ===
All types of coral blocks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
