A '''fireball''' is a large, [[explosive]], [[fire]]-starting [[projectile]] fired by [[ghast]]s as their only attack. It can be deflected with a melee {{Control|attack}} or another projectile.

== Behavior ==
Fireballs have a straight trajectory unaffected by gravity and a theoretically infinite range. Fireballs can be deflected if hit by a player using a projectile or melee attack, sending them in the direction of the player's head.

Fireballs create an [[explosion]] upon impact with an entity or block, setting [[fire]] to nearby blocks. Fireballs shot by ghasts have an explosive force of 1. The minimum [[blast resistance]] required to absorb all blast force of a fireball is 4.034. However, blocks with resistance as low as 3.5 survive if hit from the sides or from the top.

At close range, fireballs deal massive damage; a direct hit deals {{hp|6}} projectile damage and up to to {{hp|8.5}}, {{hp|15}}, or {{hp|22.5}} explosion damage from the blast depending on [[difficulty]], entities other than player treat all difficulties as normal. If an entity has the [[Fire Resistance]] effect or is naturally resistant to fire, a fireball does not deal projectile damage to them, although the explosion still can inflict damage. Fireballs rebounded by the [[player]] deal {{hp|1000}} damage to a ghast upon direct hit, killing them. Because ghasts are fire resistant, fireballs only damage ghasts when rebounded by the player or if the explosion is within range to damage them. Because fireball explosions only affect entities whose feet are within 2 blocks of the explosion, they are incapable of damaging ghasts except when hitting them from below or within their hitbox.

When two fireballs collide, one is deflected while the other explodes upon impact.

== Sounds ==
{{Edition|Java}}:<br>
Fireballs use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

* If a player hits a fireball using an item with the Looting enchantment, any mob killed by that fireball has its drops affected by the enchantment as though the mob was killed by directly using the item.
