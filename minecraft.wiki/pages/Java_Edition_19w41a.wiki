'''19w41a''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.15]], released on October 9, 2019.<ref name="19w41a">{{snap|19w41a|October 9, 2019}}</ref> It adds a new menu panorama, two new [[block]]s, the ability to toggle [[sprinting]] and [[sneaking]], and a new [[command]] for spectating.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Honey Block JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Honey block]]s'''
* Crafted from 4 [[honey bottle]]s. 
** The bottles are not consumed and remain in the crafting grid.
* Walking on them is slower, and jump height is reduced.
** Effect also works through non-full blocks like carpet, trapdoors and slabs.
* If an [[entity]] is on a honey block that is pushed by a [[piston]], the entity is moved with the honey block.
* Entities touching the side of a honey block slide down slowly.
* Landing on a honey block reduces fall damage.
** Fall damage is cut to about {{frac|1|5}} of normal: equal to <code>ceiling(fall distance - 3) / 5)</code>, or in other words, {{frac|1|5}} of {{hp|1}} for every block fallen after the first 3, rounded up.
* When a honey block is pushed or pulled by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent [[block]]s in the same direction.
** Work the same way as [[slime block]]s.
* [[Mob]]s usually avoid walking on them.
* Does not conduct redstone signals.

'''[[File:Honeycomb Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Honeycomb block]]s'''
* Purely decorative.
* Crafted using 4 [[honeycomb]]s.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|spectate}}'''
* Syntax is {{cmd|spectate [<''target''>] [<''player''>]}}.
** <code>target</code> – the target entity to spectate.
*** If omitted, makes the player stop spectating.
** <code>player</code> – the [[player]] that should spectate the target.
*** Must be in [[Spectator]] mode.
*** If omitted, <samp>@s</samp> (the executing player) is used.

'''<samp>[[Commands#Raw JSON text|clickEvent]]</samp>'''
* Added <code>copy_to_clipboard</code> action.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Control]]s'''
* {{ctrl|Sneak}} and {{ctrl|sprint}} inputs can now be switched between "Hold" and "Toggle" mode in the accessibility options.
** Allows [[player]]s to stay sneaked while opening different GUIs.
** Also affects flying down in [[Creative]] mode. When toggled, the player keeps going down until toggled again.

'''Sprites'''
'''[[Status effect]]s'''
* [[Instant Damage]]
** {{EffectSprite|instant-damage}} Added an effect sprite.
* [[Instant Health]]
** {{EffectSprite|instant-health}} Added an effect sprite.
* [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]]
** {{EffectSprite|saturation}} Added an effect sprite.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Beehive]]s'''
* Name changed from "Bee hive" to "Beehive".
** ID also changed from <code>bee_hive</code> to <code>beehive</code>.

'''[[Stripped wood]]'''
* Can now be crafted from stripped logs.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]'''
* The bee spawn egg colors have been changed from {{InvSprite|Bee Spawn Egg Revision 1}} to {{InvSprite|Bee Spawn Egg Revision 2}}.

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Mobs are better at avoiding walking through lava now.

'''[[Ender dragon]]s'''
* Removed a black dot on the transparent parts of wing texture.
* Removed texture for part of wing bottom in the exploding ender dragon.

'''[[Iron golem]]s'''
* Now starts cracking upon losing [[health]].
** A [[sound]] plays on every cracking stage.
*** There are 4 stages, from uncracked to fully cracked, before the golem dies.
* Can be healed {{ctrl|using}} [[iron ingot]]s.
** A [[sound]] plays each time the golem is repaired.
* One iron ingot restores {{hp|25}} health.
** It takes 4 iron ingots to repair an iron golem from 1 HP to full health.

'''[[Zombie villager]]s'''
* Zombie villagers that were converted from [[villager]]s can no longer despawn.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|effect}}'''
* The {{cmd|effect clear}} command now defaults to <samp>@s</samp> if no target argument is given.

=== General ===
'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Changed panorama to an image which includes new 1.15 features such as bees and bee nests.
** Because this was an asset update, the menu panorama in all previous 1.15 snapshots was also updated.
* Descriptions under buttons on the "Create World" screen are now narrated.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed <code>dirt_like</code> block tag.
