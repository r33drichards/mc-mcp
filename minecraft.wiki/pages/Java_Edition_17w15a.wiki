* Added colored beds which can be crafted with colored wool or by dyeing a white bed.
* Now bounce the player like [[slime block]]s, albeit much less.
* Now reduce (but not negate) fall damage when landed on.
** The player can survive a 41 block fall onto a bed.
*** Any higher, and the second bounce deal the remaining amount of damage to kill them.
** The player can survive a 45 block fall onto a bed if they don't take further fall damage (e.g. by landing on a platform).
* Now a [[block entity]], and each half can be colored individually using the <code>color</code> tag.
* Now use a 3D item model instead of a 2D item because of the new colors.
