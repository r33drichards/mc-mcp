A '''block of iron''', known internally as an '''iron block''', is a precious [[metal]] block equivalent to nine [[iron ingot]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Blocks of iron can be mined only with a [[stone pickaxe]] or better. If a block of iron is mined without the use of a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

== Usage ==
Blocks of iron can be used to store [[iron ingot]]s in a compact fashion.

=== Beacons ===
Blocks of iron can be used to "power" a [[beacon]]. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of iron blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely blocks of iron, as they may also contain [[blocks of gold]], [[blocks of diamond]], [[blocks of netherite]] or [[blocks of emerald]].

=== Spawning iron golems ===
{{FakeImage|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Carved Pumpkin|i=Block of Iron| p |iii| i }}|Iron golem build configuration.}}
Blocks of iron and [[carved pumpkin]]s or [[jack o'lantern]]s are used to build [[iron golem]]s. The carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern must be placed last, and the golem spawns immediately after placing it.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Note blocks ===
Blocks of iron can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce iron xylophone sounds.
