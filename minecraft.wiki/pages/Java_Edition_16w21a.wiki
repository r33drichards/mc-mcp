'''16w21a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.10]], released on May 25, 2016,<ref name="16w21a-blog">https://web.archive.org/web/20160526231610/http://www.mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-snapshot-16w21a/</ref> which made minor changes to the behavior of blocks and items and fixed bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* <code>FallFlying</code>
** Allows mobs to use elytra when they fall.
*** Mobs lose their ability to fly after touching the ground.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bone block]]s'''
* No longer transparent.

'''[[Dispenser]]s'''
* Can now equip shields onto entities.

'''[[Rail]]s (all types)'''
* Bounding box for ascending rails is a full block (formerly only {{frac|5|32}} of a block tall).

'''[[Structure block]]s'''
* No longer emit light.
* Added "Structure Integrity and Seed" to load mode (NBT tags <code>integrity</code> and <code>seed</code> respectively).

=== Items ===
'''[[Chorus fruit]]s'''
* Can now teleport riders from their mounts.

'''[[Ender pearl]]s'''
* Can now teleport riders from their mounts.

'''[[Fishing rod]]s'''
* Can now pull items to the player.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Wolves]]'''
* No longer despawn.

=== World generation ===
'''[[End portal]]s'''
* Now replace any blocks inside the portal frame ring when activating.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Blacksmiths now generate with cobblestone in all biomes (rather than acacia logs in savannas and sandstone in deserts).

=== Command format ===
'''NBT format'''
* <code>IsVillager</code> and <code>VillagerProfession</code> tags are now fully removed, replaced by the <code>ZombieType</code> first added in [[16w20a]].

=== General ===
'''[[Particle]]s'''
* <code>fallingdust</code> now can be summoned, making use of the <code>params</code> argument like <code>blockcrack</code> and several other particles do. 
** Example: {{cmd|particle fallingdust ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 0 1 0 @p 10}} summons a particle matching the color of lava (block ID 10).
