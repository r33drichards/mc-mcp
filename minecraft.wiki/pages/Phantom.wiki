'''Phantoms''' are flying [[undead]] [[hostile mob]]s that spawn in the night sky when the [[player]] has not laid in a [[bed]] or died for three or more in-game days. They attack by diving at the player from the sky to bite them.

== Spawning ==
[[File:Phantom at night.png|thumb|Two phantoms at night.]]
Phantoms spawn unless the [[game rule]] <code>spawn_phantoms</code>{{only|je|short=1}} or <code>doInsomnia</code>{{only|be|short=1}} is set to <code>false</code>. The spawning mechanics differ between ''[[Java]]'' and [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']] editions. In both editions, they spawn in the [[Overworld]] above a [[player]] whose "Time Since Last Rest" [[statistic]] is at least 1 hour (72000 ticks or 3 in-game days).{{verify|It seems to be longer in Bedrock}} This statistic is reset when the player dies or enters a [[bed]]. This does not require skipping the night. <!--confusing statement, multiplayer phantom spawning is still dependent per-playerPhantoms may still spawn in multiplayer if there are any players who have not slept for 3 in-game days.--> Furthermore, the player must not have a block overhead that [[opacity|blocks light]] in any way; for example, leaves prevent phantoms from spawning as they have a light opacity of 2, but [[glass]] does not, as its light opacity is 0. Phantoms do not spawn above players in [[Spectator]] mode, but they do spawn above players in [[Creative]] mode.<ref>{{bug|MC-145177|||WAI}}</ref>

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Phantom spawning is similar to other monsters spawning: the spawn location must have a light level of 7 or less, and spawns are limited by the monster population cap. Phantoms are also subject to a density cap of 5. Phantom spawn attempts are made on surface blocks throughout the same spawn radius as other monsters. However, when a phantom spawn attempt succeeds, the phantom appears somewhere in a 21×15×21 cube centered 28 blocks above the player instead of at the block where the spawn attempt occurred.

This means phantoms can also spawn during daytime as long as there are suitable blocks around players who are directly below the sky. The number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in [[Easy]] difficulty, 1-3 in [[Normal]], and 1-4 in [[Hard]]. Blocks that can spawn phantoms needs to count as surface, that is, they have to be the highest spawnable block having no solid blocks directly above them. A solid floor under a roof of leaves, with at least 8 air blocks in between, meets this criteria.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
[[File:PhantomSpawnRange.png|thumb|The phantom's spawn range in ''Java Edition''. The glass at the bottom indicates the player's position, the red stained glass indicates phantom spawning locations, and the blue stained glass indicates the bounding box of the spawn range.]]
Phantoms attempt to spawn every {{tooltip|1–2 minutes|1200–2400 ticks}}. They spawn only if it is night or a thunderstorm is happening, the player is above sea level (y=64) with sky visible directly above, and the [[local difficulty]] is greater than a randomly chosen value between 0.0 and 3.0. The formula {{fraction|''x''−72000|''x''}} represents the chance of a successful spawn, where ''x'' is the number of ticks since the player last entered a bed or died. This roughly comes to a {{fraction|1|4}} (25.0%) chance on day 4, a {{fraction|2|5}} (40.0%) chance on day 5, a {{fraction|3|6}} ({{fraction|1|2}}) (50.0%) chance on day 6, {{fraction|4|7}} (about 57.1%) chance on day 7, and so on.

If all conditions are met, a group of phantoms attempts to spawn 20–34 blocks above the player, and off to the side by a [[Chebyshev distance]] of up to 10 blocks. The number of phantoms spawned is 1-2 in [[Easy]] difficulty, 1-3 in [[Normal]], and 1-4 in [[Hard]]. Phantoms can spawn inside buildings, if the player is outside and the building is both near enough and the building has a large enough cavity for them to spawn inside.

Phantoms count toward the hostile [[mob]] cap, but they do not adhere to it when spawning.<ref>{{bug|MC-198101}}</ref> Their spawning mechanic is based on the location of players in the world rather than by chance, unlike regular [[mob spawning]]. Phantom spawning is completely independent of biome, meaning they can spawn in biomes that normally prevent hostile mob spawning such as [[mushroom fields]]<ref>{{bug|MC-126778}}</ref> and [[the void]].<ref>{{bug|MC-127599}}</ref> The number of phantoms that spawn indirectly increase in number every consecutive night a player has not entered a bed, as there is a higher chance that phantoms spawn every time there is a spawn attempt. They then stop spawning when the player lies down in bed.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Phantom Membrane|notes=player|quantity=0-1|lootingquantity=0-1}}

== Behavior ==
[[File:Phantom 2.0.png|thumb|right|A phantom swooping at the [[player]]. In addition, a [[spider]] is stalking the player and a [[sheep]] and some [[Pig|pigs]] can be seen in the background.]]
When idle, phantoms fly around in a roughly circular pattern within 15 to 25 blocks of a [[player]] horizontally and within 24 to 35 blocks of a player vertically. They leave a trail of gray smoke while they fly. Their [[movement speed]] is one of the fastest of any mob, up to 20 blocks per second. They have a large search radius, targeting and following players from 64 blocks away. Once every 10-20 seconds{{only|bedrock|short=1}} or every 8-12 seconds{{only|je|short=1}}, they swoop in to attack. If stopped or hurt during this action, the phantom retreats back to its original elevation with sky visibility. When a path to its original elevation is obstructed by a block, the phantom continues attempting to return to its original elevation until it either attacks or moves out from under the block. In the case of spawning under a high glass ceiling, phantoms spawn, immediately attack, and then fly up to the glass (even despawning in the process if they get far enough). Phantoms attack exposed players in beds, but do not attack players in [[Creative|creative mode]]. Phantoms switch targets if a player has spawned them but another player qualifies to be attacked, however they are neutralized if the spawning or targeted player resets their timer.

Phantoms can move through water at their normal speed. Phantoms do not drown.

A phantom's body disappears when under the [[Invisibility]] effect, but its eyes and smoke [[particle]]s are still visible.

[[Cat]]s hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 16 blocks away from them. (This is true even if the cat is inside a building.) {{IN|bedrock}}, phantoms also avoid [[ocelot]]s in the same manner.

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* ignored by the [[wither]].
* affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* a threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Like [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s, phantoms burn in sunlight. They burn even when equipped with [[helmet]]s through commands.<ref>{{bug|MC-146985||Helmeted phantoms still burn under the sunlight}}</ref> Phantoms leave a trail of [[particles]] behind each wing.

The eyes of phantoms are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]].

=== Detailed pathing behavior ===

[[File:Phantoms circling below player.jpg|thumb|right|Phantoms circling below a player in creative mode, who is standing 30 blocks above the logical spawning locations]]
Observation in Bedrock Edition v1.20: It seems that the circling is better described as targeting a certain location. This location starts out as the ground block that they logically spawned from.  This means that they can circle even *below* the player.  After swooping a player (even unsuccessfully), a new target location is designated, and thus a new circling height.
