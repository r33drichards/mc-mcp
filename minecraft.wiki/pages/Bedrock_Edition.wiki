'''''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition''''' (just '''''Minecraft'''''<ref group="note">Full title on Google Play and the Apple App Store is '''''Minecraft: Dream it, Build it!'''''</ref> on most platforms and in-game) is the multi-platform versions of ''[[Minecraft]]'' developed by [[Mojang Studios]], [[Xbox Game Studios]], and [[SkyBox Labs]] and based on the [[#Bedrock codebase|Bedrock codebase]]. ''Bedrock Edition'' was released on September 20, 2017 with the version [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0|1.2.0]] as a continuation of ''[[Pocket Edition]]''.

== Bedrock codebase ==
The term "Bedrock Edition" originates from the Bedrock codebase, which was created in the {{W|C++}} programming language to run on platforms that cannot support {{w|Java (programming language)|Java}}. Code was added to accommodate differences in the target platforms for such facilities as networking and storage access, though most of the code is used on every platform. This common core of functionality is called the "Bedrock Engine".<ref>{{mcnet|better-together-faq|Better Together FAQ|September 20, 2017}}</ref>

The codebase resides within a software system that manages the pieces of code and tracks their evolution. This allows the codebase to host not only the current version but all past versions, the standalone [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]] (BDS) versions, and several Beta versions simultaneously with no conflicts. 

Target platform builds are created individually, then transmitted to the platform's app store. Most stores have their own compliance requirements and subject the incoming edition to a series of certification tests before making it available for download. [[Xbox Game Studios]] attempts to synchronize availability across stores, but the certification process is not under their control and can delay an edition's availability on a certain platform, especially if it fails certification and has to go back to the developers for a fix.

Bedrock code is used for {{el|ee}}, and {{el|ce}}, as well as the discontinued {{el|mcl}}, {{el|mcd}}, {{el|pi}}, {{el|ds}}, and {{el|mce}}.

== Nomenclature ==
Up until June 7, 2022<ref>{{mcnet|java---bedrock-edition-pc-out-june-7|Java & Bedrock Edition for PC is out on June 7|June 4, 2022|Cristina Anderca}}</ref>, the name "''Bedrock Edition''" was not the official name of any edition of the game. Starting with the [[Better Together Update]], all Bedrock editions of ''Minecraft'' have been named simply '''''Minecraft'''''. Before then, they each had a subtitle identifying the target platform, including {{el|pe}} (for all mobile platforms), {{el|Windows 10}}, {{el|Gear VR}}, and {{el|Fire TV}}. The earliest of these was {{el|pe|nl=1}}, also known as "MCPE" or "PE", and these names were (and still are) sometimes used to refer to all the Bedrock editions, possibly even including those that were introduced after the renaming occurred.

The renaming of the Bedrock editions to ''Minecraft'' with no "Edition" subtitles created confusion in the community for several reasons: 
*This name had until then referred to the original Java version of the game, now known as {{JE}}, which is not ''Bedrock Edition''. The Java version was renamed to ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' at the same time the Bedrock editions were renamed to ''Minecraft'', so for a while any use of the name was ambiguous.
*Although officially named just ''Minecraft'', the game is marketed as ''Minecraft for Windows'', ''Minecraft for Android'', ''Minecraft for iOS'', ''Minecraft for Xbox'', ''Minecraft for Nintendo Switch'', and ''Minecraft for PlayStation 4''.<ref>[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/minecraft-for-windows/9nblggh2jhxj?ocid=storeforweb Minecraft for Windows | Xbox]</ref><ref>[https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft-xbox-one Minecraft for Xbox | Minecraft]</ref><ref>[https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft-switch Minecraft for Nintendo Switch | Minecraft]</ref><ref>[https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft-ps4 Minecraft for PlayStation 4 | Minecraft]</ref> These names are also visible for the app itself, but not in-game. 
*The term "''Minecraft''" was (and still is) also commonly used to refer to the game in general.

Together, these complications made the official name ''Minecraft'' useless for referring to the Bedrock editions collectively. The editors of the [[Minecraft Wiki (website)|Minecraft Wiki]], however, needed such a term in order to describe the functioning of the Bedrock Engine across all editions, so despite there not being a real ''Bedrock Edition'', the wiki chose to use this as a {{w|Jargon#Industry term|term of art}}, based on the [[#Bedrock codebase|internal name of the codebase]].<ref>[[Minecraft Wiki talk:Projects/Renaming]]</ref> Subsequently, the community adopted it as well, and it is now the ''de facto'' standard term for referring to all the Bedrock editions collectively. [[Mojang Studios]] employees have also used the term "''Bedrock Edition''" to refer to said edition in news articles.

Since June 7, 2022, both ''Java Edition'' for PC and ''Bedrock Edition'' for Windows are sold under one bundle, titled '''''Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC''''', marking the first official use of "''Bedrock Edition''" as a subtitle in any Bedrock editions.<ref>{{ytl|qNMfF9TYETM|Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition – Official Trailer|Minecraft|June 8, 2022}}</ref> On September 10, 2024, the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' update, [[Launcher 3.0.13]], changed the previous naming of ''Minecraft for Windows'' to ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition''.

== Gameplay ==
{{See also|Bedrock Edition exclusive features|Gameplay}}
The objective of the game remains the same as {{JE}}, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. Like them, ''Bedrock Edition'' has [[survival]] elements such as [[hunger]] and [[brewing]], and [[the Nether]] and [[End]] dimensions. The [[multiplayer]] mode is cross-platform compatible between all supported devices.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120313124931/http://www.mojang.com/2011/11/minecraft-pocket-edition-on-ios/ ''Minecraft - Pocket Edition'' on iOS!] - Mojang.com; November 18, 2011</ref>

''Bedrock Edition'' differs from ''Java Edition'' and Legacy Console Edition in a variety of ways, such as more saturated graphics, different terrain generation, some exclusive items, and an official add-on system.<ref>[https://minecraft.net/addons Minecraft Add-Ons: Customize Your Experience | Minecraft]</ref> The [[HUD]] and other elements vary for each relevant device. Players can interact with the game via a keyboard and mouse, touchscreen, or a gamepad. 

Differences from ''Java Edition'' include: 
<!-- This list is just fluff. How could we improve it? Should we try to define the most important differences? Perhaps the ones most likely to influence purchasing decisions?-->
{{See also|Parity issue list}}
*Some [[mob]]s, [[block]]s and [[item]]s behave and look differently from their ''Java Edition'' counterparts.
*Multiplayer allows for 4 ways of player connection:
**LAN, allowing for 8 or more players to be on a single world<!-- /setmaxplayers can change this value -->
**[[Realms]], an official server-hosting service allowing for up to 2 (Realms Core) or 10 (Realms Plus) players to play on a world.
**[[Bedrock Dedicated Server|a user-created external server]]
**Connecting to players' local worlds through the Xbox friends system.
*A list of "featured" (Mojang Studios partner) servers, offering predefined multiplayer minigames in a ''Minecraft'' setting, is also provided.
*[[Add-on|A system to modify the game created and maintained by Mojang Studios]]

Some features of ''Bedrock Edition'' are available only on certain platforms. 
*Importing or exporting worlds is supported only on Windows.
*Joining servers through IP isn't supported by Xbox, Nintendo Switch, or PlayStation.
*Windows and mobile devices support all three different control types: "Keyboard & Mouse", "Controller", and "Touch".
**Xbox and PlayStation support both "Keyboard & Mouse" and "Controller".

Some devices below these specifications have been known to work fine either with or without custom ROM images, kernels, and {{w|overclocking}} of the CPU. The {{w|MSM7000#MSM7x27|MSM7227}} CPU is not supported due to its lack of a floating-point unit.<ref>{{w|MSM7000#MSM7x27|MSM7000 § MSM7x27}}</ref> The NVIDIA {{w|Tegra 2}} processor is also not supported because it lacks support for NEON.

=== Release ===
A video of an early prototype was released on X (formerly Twitter), showing the game on the Xperia PLAY. The Alpha version was later released and was released for different platforms on October 7, 2011. The non-exclusive version was going to be released on September 29 for Android<ref>{{ytl|rCcsuPH4vJY|Minecraft - Pocket Edition Touch Controls|Minecraft|September 26, 2011}}</ref>, but several severe bugs needed to be fixed; the release was delayed until October 7.

A version for iOS devices was confirmed to be released before 2012 in an interview with Mojang Studios<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007070920/http://unboundgamer.com/_/minecraft-pocket-edition-interview-with-mojang-r393 Minecraft Pocket Edition Interview With Mojang's Daniel Kaplan] - Unboundgamer; September 29, 2011</ref> and was subsequently released on November 17, 2011.

=== Alpha ===
{{main|Bedrock Edition Alpha}}
After the initial releases for Android and iOS, updates were released in parallel, with the same features being added for both platforms. During the Alpha stage, various aspects of gameplay were introduced into the Bedrock codebase, including: [[crafting]], [[smelting]], more [[block]]s, [[item]]s, [[mob]]s, and more game modes to bring it closer to the ''Java Edition''. As the ''Pocket Edition'' development team works closely, often blocks released on the ''Java Edition'' are released around the same time for ''Pocket Edition''. Certain features were also tested on ''Pocket Edition'' before their Java releases, such as [[beetroot]]s and their related items, and also [[block models]].

During the Alpha phase, the Bedrock codebase was ported to more platforms: first, ''Pocket Edition'' was released for Fire on September 13, 2012, and for Windows Phone on December 10, 2014. The {{el|Windows 10}} Beta was released on July 29, 2015, at a higher price than ''Pocket Edition''. {{el|Gear VR}} was released April 27, 2016, for the same price as ''Pocket Edition''.

Two other versions of ''[[Minecraft]]'' that are based on the Bedrock codebase, but separate from Bedrock Edition, were also released during this period. {{el|pi}} is a free and discontinued version of ''Minecraft'' for the Raspberry Pi, which was based on an old alpha version of Bedrock. {{el|ee}} was released for Windows and macOS on November 1, 2016.

{{see also|Minecraft Preview}}
Starting on November 22, 2013,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131210073616/https://mojang.com/2013/11/android-beta-program-for-minecraft-pe/ Android beta program for Minecraft PE] - Mojang.com; November 22, 2013</ref> [[Mojang Studios]] began to publicly release testing versions of full updates to Android users who opt into the beta program, to get major feedback, especially for bug reporting. This enabled the official updates to be considerably more stable.

Versions from 0.8.0 to 0.12.1 required opting into a Google+ group to receive development builds. Players would then see development updates appear as normal updates in the Play Store. On July 17, 2015, the Google+ group was removed due to the amount of spam and advertisements that the group attracted.<ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|621982409140105216|PE BETA community in G+ that was briefly available yesterday and today was real, but we only used it for "spam control testing". >>|July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|621984399349948416|The community was removed and no longer exists. We always announce beta on our Twitter accounts and sometimes on Mojang blog.|July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|621992330313236480|We were trying to limit spam amount we get from people who sign up not to test but to advertise.|July 17, 2015}}</ref> On November 3, 2015, the PE Beta team published a [https://pocketbeta.minecraft.net dedicated blog]<ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|661531497527164928|Please, read the FAQ bfore you ask a question.|November 3, 2015}}{{sic}}</ref> that was subsequently used for users to opt into the 0.13.0 beta program and to display changelogs for these development builds.

The Xbox Insider Hub app is used to opt into the beta program on Windows since July 31, 2017, and on Xbox One since August 24. Before the release of the Better Together Update, the Xbox One beta was available only to owners of the digital version of the original {{el|xb1}}, and not owners of the disc version.

Starting on January 31, 2022, the beta program was expanded to other platforms, starting with iOS and iPadOS, with ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''.<ref>{{cite|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4423653831821|title=Minecraft Preview FAQ - Home|date=January 31, 2022}}.</ref> The previous beta program through Xbox Insider Hub has been phased out and replaced by ''Minecraft Preview''.

Players can also test unfinished or work-in-progress features using [[Experiments|Experimental Gameplay]], a toggle that can be turned on through world settings, but once on, it cannot be turned off again in that world.

== Price ==
Although all Bedrock editions are nearly identical, the price<ref group="note">''Minecraft'' is sold in {{w|United States dollar|USD}} by the publishers, and conversions vary from different distributors.</ref> varies depending on the platform. The mobile versions cost {{w|United States dollar|US$}}6.99 ({{w|Pound sterling|£}}6.99), while the ChromeOS, Xbox, and PS4 versions cost US$19.99 (£19.99, £16.74, and £12.99 respectively). The Windows and Nintendo Switch versions are the most expensive, both costing US$29.99 (£24.99 and £19.99 respectively), though the Windows version includes ''Java Edition'' and the Nintendo Switch version includes some DLC. DLC purchased from the [[Marketplace]] on one platform is usable on all other platforms, but the game itself is sold separately on each platform. Xbox [[Achievement|achievements]] are not shared between platforms, and buying the game on one of these platforms does not get the game on the others. The Xbox and Windows versions are included with ''{{w|Xbox Game Pass}} Premium'' and ''Xbox Game Pass Ultimate'', with the Windows version also included with ''PC Game Pass''.<ref>[https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC | Minecraft]</ref> The PS4 version is PS4 Pro enhanced.<ref>[https://playstation.com/games/minecraft Minecraft - PS4 Games | PlayStation]</ref> As with all other versions of ''Minecraft'', updates are free of charge. On Windows, the game can be launched via the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''.

== Sales ==
[[File:Minecraft Sales Data.png|315px|thumb|''Minecraft'' sales data, up to December 2015.<!-- is there a more up-to-date graph? -->]]
As of December 2013, ''Pocket Edition'' (the only Bedrock Codebase edition at the time) had sold 16.5 million copies, while at the same time, the {{JE}} had sold 13 million. These calculations came out after the 0.8.0 update.<ref>[https://theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/17/mojang-minecraft-pocket-edition-apple As Minecraft tops Apple's apps chart for 2013, Mojang talks Pocket Edition] - The Guardian; December 17, 2013</ref> This was considered a huge success, with ''Pocket Edition'' outselling both ''Java Edition'' and [[Legacy Console Edition]], despite being considered to be the least-developed at the time.

On December 2, 2016, [[Marsh Davies]] announced that ''Pocket Edition'' had sold over 40 million copies<ref>{{Mcnet|pocket-edition-5-years-old|Pocket Edition is 5 years old!|December 2, 2016}}</ref> (at the time, ''Java Edition'' had sold over 24 million). This statistic included {{el|Windows 10}} and {{el|Gear VR}}.

''Minecraft'' is also usually in the top 10 and regularly #1 in the Apple App Store's and Google Play's ''Paid Apps'' Section in the ''Top Charts''.<ref>https://apple.com/itunes/charts/paid-apps</ref><ref>https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/topselling_paid</ref>

* The term "Bedrock Edition" was originally an unofficial coinage, as Mojang did not provide any official sublabelling to distinguish the edition from ''Java Edition''. After a couple of years, Mojang themselves began to use the term, and it gained official status.
