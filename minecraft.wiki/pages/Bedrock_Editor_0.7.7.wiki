'''Bedrock Editor v0.7.7''' is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on October 30, 2024, that upgrades grapple locomotion and widgets and fixes bugs.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/205</ref><ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/31476211695501</ref>

== Changes ==
'''Grapple locomotion'''
* Added {{cd|getRay()}} to Cursor Service API
* Camera now rotates toward grapple target during flight and is less snappy
* Grapple now lets the creator fly 100 blocks distance toward the mouse pointer if there is no nearby block to grapple to
* Changed hotkey for grapple-to-selection from {{key|F}} to {{key|ctrl+shift+F}}
* Fixed issue where camera flashes to the inside of the player mobs' head when grappling.

'''Widgets'''
* Added a new {{cd|ClipboardWidgetComponent}} to the client widget system to allow creators to be able to add clipboard items to widgets, and have them displayed as 'holograms'
* Added a flag to {{cd|Widget}} and {{cd|WidgetBaseComponent}} to allow locking the Y position to the surface, based on the XZ position
* Added a flag to {{cd|Widget}} to tell the widget to bind it's position to that of the 3D block cursor

'''API'''
* Changed {{cd|IModalToolContainer.addTool}} API function to take unique tool id as a required argument.
* Removed {{cd|inputContextId}} and {{cd|inputContextLabel}} from creation parameters.
* Removed {{cd|hide}}, {{cd|show}}, {{cd|dispose}} functions from {{cd|IModalTool}} API
* Renamed anchor in the {{cd|ClipboardWriteOptions}} to {{cd|normalizedOrigin}} for clarity
* Removed all of the {{cd|CursorAttachment}} related types, properties and methods

'''Miscellaneous'''
* Renamed "height" to  "length" for pyramid brush settings to be more consistent when rotated.
* Added quick action button bar to Selection (Deselect & Fill)
* Added Copy & Cut to main menu and action bar items
* Added information tooltip links for core editor panes
* Enabled middle mouse block picking in block picker modal

== Fixes ==
* Fixed a bug where cylinder and cuboid brushes with a height of 1 were incorrectly sized.
* Fixed deselect in Line Tool (this was actually a problem with Client Widgets not correctly tracking selected state in script)
* Fix incorrect key binding in Selection move up/down
* Fixed 'Next Navigation Position' keyboard shortcut to no longer conflict with 'Previous Navigation Position'.
* Brush Painting tools only work in the starting dimension (generally Overworld) and do not work when changing dimensions
* Selection tool size input box is now enabled when block is selected
* Fixed keyboard navigation for interactive tooltip links
* Fixed padding for Selection tool panel items when the scrollbar is absent
