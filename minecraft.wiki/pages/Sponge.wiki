A '''sponge''' is a block that can be placed to remove [[water]] in an area around itself. This turns it into a '''wet sponge''', which can be [[smelt]]ed or placed in [[the Nether]] to dry it to be reused. Sponges can only be found in [[ocean monument]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Either type of sponge can be mined by hand, or with any tool, dropping itself as an item; however, [[hoe]]s break sponges the fastest compared to other tools.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Sponge, Wet Sponge|link=Sponge|Hoe}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[Ocean monument]]s can have "sponge rooms". Each room contains an average of 30 wet sponges. See [[Ocean Monument/Structure]] for details.

=== Drying ===
A wet sponge placed in [[the Nether]] dries out instantly with a puff of steam and turns into a normal sponge.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a wet sponge placed in any [[Biome#Dry biomes|dry biome]] in the [[Overworld]] dries out after a few minutes and turns into a normal sponge. If a normal sponge comes into contact with water in a dry biome, it absorbs the water and immediately dries out with a puff of steam.

=== Smelting ===
A wet sponge can be dried in a [[furnace]], making the sponge reusable.

|description=If a bucket is in the fuel slot at the time the sponge completes its drying, the water drains into the bucket, leaving a bucket of water in the fuel slot. Otherwise, the water just evaporates.

== Usage ==
[[File:SpongeUsage.png|thumb|A sponge absorbing water in a pond.]]
A sponge can be used to turn water into air by "absorbing" the water. A sponge instantly absorbs nearby water when it is placed next to water or when water comes into contact with it. Sponges immediately turn wet upon absorption and do not absorb any more water afterward. Wet sponges drip small water particles. Sponges in [[item (entity)|item form]] do not absorb water or become wet.

A sponge absorbs both flowing and source blocks of [[water]] up to 4 blocks away{{Verify}} (taken as a [[taxicab distance]]) in all six directions around itself. Instead of a cube or a sphere, this effectively encloses the volume of an {{w|octahedron}} with vertices placed 4 units away from the center in each direction due to the game's extensive use of taxicab distance. A sponge does not absorb more than 118{{Verify}} blocks of water however, and water closest to the sponge is absorbed first. The absorption propagates only between adjacent water blocks and does not "jump over" non-water blocks, including air.
