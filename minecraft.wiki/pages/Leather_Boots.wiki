'''Leather boots''' are a variant of [[boots]] that are crafted from [[leather]]. They are the seventh-highest [[tier]] of boots, having the same armor points as [[Golden Boots|golden]], [[Copper Boots|copper]], and [[chainmail boots]] but with lower durability. Wearing them allows an [[entity]] to walk on and climb through [[powder snow]]. Like all [[leather armor]], they can be [[dye|dyed]] and protect the wearer from [[freezing]].

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include leather boots. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the boots they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

=== Fishing ===
Leather boots can be caught as a "junk" item when [[fishing]].

== Usage ==
When worn, leather boots provides {{armor|1}} [[armor point]].

=== Powder snow ===
Leather boots can be used to safely cross [[powder snow]] without sinking in it. The block behaves similar to [[scaffolding]], allowing the player to sink in by pressing {{control|crouch}} and move up by pressing {{control|jump}}. The boots also prevent the wearer from taking freezing damage.

Boots can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding units of the [[tiers]]' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the boots' maximum durability, rounded down. Two boots of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the boots' [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
Boots can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
