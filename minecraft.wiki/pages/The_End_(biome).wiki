'''The End''' is a biome used to generate [[the End]] dimension. There are five biomes in the End, but they are considered separate biomes only {{in|Java}}. Outer End islands are generated by a different mechanism {{in|Bedrock}}.

== Description ==
This biome is exclusive to the End dimension. [[End stone]] is the only block to generate apart from those found in structures. [[Endermen]], the [[ender dragon]], and [[shulker]]s{{only|be|short=1}} are the only mobs to spawn naturally. The terrain is almost completely flat and consists of separate islands floating in the void. There is no weather or daylight cycle in the biome, like [[the Nether]].

{{IN|Java}}, this biome is only used in a circle of radius 1024 centered at the 0,0 coordinates in the End. The End central island is generated at the center of this circle, surrounded by emptiness all the way to the edge of the biome. Most of the End features are exclusive to here, including the [[ender dragon]], the [[End spike]]s, the [[End crystal]]s, the 5×5 [[End Platform|spawn platform]], the [[exit portal]], and the 20 central [[End gateways]], which generate after the ender dragon has been defeated. If the biome is used for a [[superflat]] world, the sky appears nearly black, no exit portal generates and endermen are the only mobs to spawn at night.

In addition to the features from the main End island, the rest of the features in the End are also part of this biome {{In|be}}, including [[outer End islands]], rogue End gateways, [[End cities]], and [[chorus plants]]. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the sky is colored purple at the horizon and black at zenith, with End flashes brightening the environment and creating shadows. During an End flash, a strong purple volumetric [[fog]] effect is visible. [[Water]] is also colored purple, and the water fog much denser than in the Overworld.

{{IN|Java}}, this is the biome that occupies the smallest portion of the map: a circular radius of 1000 blocks, making it cover 3.5 billionths of the entire dimension. {{IN|Bedrock}}, this biome is instead the biggest, as it is used to generate the whole dimension.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
