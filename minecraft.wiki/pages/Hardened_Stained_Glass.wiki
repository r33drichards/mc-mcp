'''Hardened stained glass''' is the dyed type of [[hardened glass]] that has been [[Chemistry Update|chemically]] strengthened, crafted from dyed [[stained glass]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Unlike normal stained glass, hardened stained glass drops as an [[item]] to be picked up again when broken with any tool or by hand. It also takes significantly longer to break.

== Usage ==
Most blocks that require placement on a [[solid block]] can be placed on hardened stained glass. [[Torch]]es and [[redstone torch]]es, which can be placed on top of the hardened stained glass blocks, can also be attached to the sides of them.

Hardened stained glass blocks adjacent to other hardened stained glass blocks are invisible when viewed through the glass, but not when viewed through normal [[stained glass]].

The hardened stained glass also has much higher [[hardness]] than normal [[stained glass]].
