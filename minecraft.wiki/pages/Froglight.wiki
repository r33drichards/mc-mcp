A '''froglight''' is a light-emitting block that is obtained when a [[frog]] eats a tiny [[magma cube]]. It comes in three variants based on the variant of frog that eats the magma cube.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Froglights drop as an item when broken with any tool or by hand. Breaking speed is always the same; no specific tool can break a froglight faster.<ref>{{bug|MC-260862||Froglights do not have an assigned tool}}</ref>

A tiny [[magma cube]] drops a froglight when it is eaten by a [[frog]]. There are three colors of froglight that drop depending on what type of frog eats the magma cube:

{| class="wikitable"
!Frog type
!Froglight color
|-
|{{EntitySprite|warm-frog}} Warm
|{{BlockSprite|pearlescent-froglight}} Pearlescent 
|-
|{{EntitySprite|temperate-frog}} Temperate
|{{BlockSprite|ochre-froglight}} Ochre 
|-
|{{EntitySprite|cold-frog}} Cold
|{{BlockSprite|verdant-froglight}} Verdant
|-
|}

== Usage ==
Froglights have a smooth texture and can be used as light sources. They [[Light#Light-emitting blocks|emit light]] level 15, the highest level possible for a light-emitting block. Froglights also melt [[snow layer]]s within 3 blocks and [[ice]] within 4 blocks ([[taxicab distance]]).

Froglights can be placed in three different orientations, similar to [[log]]s, [[deepslate]], and [[basalt]].

== Trivia ==
*According to a ''[[Block of the Month]]'' article, small magma cubes are mistaken for small slimes by frogs, which try to eat them, realize their mistake, and then spit them out.<ref name=":0">{{mcnet|meet-frog|Meet the Frog|May 30, 2022|Cristina Anderca}}</ref>
*One name that was considered for the pearlescent froglight during development was the "blanc froglight".<ref name=":0" /> According to content creator [https://hermitcraft.fandom.com/wiki/PearlescentMoon PearlescentMoon], [[Agnes Larsson]] said the pearlescent froglight is named in reference to her.<ref>{{citation|url=https://twitch.tv/videos/2404644638|title=Live at Mojang HQ!!!! w/ Pearl|section=|website=twitch.tv|author=TheOrionSound|date=March 13, 2025|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250313165719/https://twitch.tv/videos/2404644638}} (00:05:10) {{dead link}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|v_eXu1RpeBE|LIVE From Mojang Studios!! ft.

*Pearlescent and verdant froglights have nearly exact opposite hues.
