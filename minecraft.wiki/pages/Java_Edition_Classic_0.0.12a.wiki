== Additions ==<!--Please do NOT add a additions table here-->
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Bedrock JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bedrock]]'''
* Unobtainable to the player.
* Bedrock and the layer above (if at the bottom of the world) is always dark even if exposed to the sky.
* Generates at the bottom of the world and in world boundary.
* Can't be broken, placed against, or otherwise selected.
* Also called “unbreakable stone”
'''[[File:Lava JE1.png|32px]] [[Lava]]'''
* A type of liquid.
* Is transparent.
* Underneath lava, the mist is thin and orange in color. 
* Spreads infinitely.
* Saplings decay if placed in lava
* Lava spreads by duplicating itself to open horizontal and downward squares.
* Lava is slower than [[water]] and can be easily outrun.
* Model has z-fighting with blocks below lava.

'''[[File:Water JE1.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* A type of liquid.
* Is transparent.
* Spreads infinitely.
* Doesn't work outside the map (it doesn't spread from world border after terrain generation).<ref>{{link|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg203496#msg203496|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=TIGSource Forums|author=Syrion|date=May 22, 2009|quote=water just outside of the map doesn't actually "work". It doesn't fill up any pits next to it.}}</ref>
* Saplings decay if placed in water
* Water spreads by duplicating itself to open horizontal and downward squares.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Pressing {{key|F}} cycles between four levels of render distance which was known as "Fog setting".<ref name="TigSource">{{cite|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg201928#msg201927|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=TigSource|date=May 19, 2009|quote=F to change draw distance. There are four settings. The fourth setting makes the game run at 50 fps on my Eee, but it's a bit.. claustrophobic. N to generate a new level. No more restarting the applet!}}</ref>
* Pressing {{key|N}} generates a new level, with a new level generation screen.<ref name="TigSource"/>

'''[[Swimming]]'''
* Only applies to players. 
* [[Mob (entity)|Mobs]] move at full speed in the water.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Stone JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Stone]]'''
* Water next to lava produces stone.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Steve JE1.png|40px]] [[File:Old human mob walking animation.gif|40px]] '''[[Mob (entity)|Mobs]]'''
* No longer get reset on level reset, meaning there is no way to get rid of mobs now.<ref>{{link|url=https://archive.org/download/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009/history/files/May-15-to-June-03-2009/2009-05-19.155457-0400EDT.txt.~1~|title=TigIRC logs|date=May 19, 2009, UTC–4|website=Archive.org|quote=(18:39:43) <notch> oh, they don't get reset on level resets either.. I'd better fix that.}}</ref>

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Player]]'''
* Player jump height increased by about 0.5 blocks.<ref>{{ytl|jwgXo3LYKaU|Minecraft Water test|Nizzotch Archive}}</ref>

=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* An infinite ocean now surrounds the map, making it impossible to fall off the world.
* The player can no longer pass the edge of the map.
* Terrain is messier with more bumps visible on the surface. It also now generates in islands.
** The terrain always generates one block above ocean level.
** Lakes occur when the surrounding water is at a higher level than the terrain.
** All dirt with access to sunlight doesn't become grass blocks upon world generation if below water level.
* Lava lakes also spawn occasionally.
* Worlds made before this version receive a bedrock layer at the bottom of the map and an ocean surrounding it.</onlyinclude>

== Bugs ==
'''1 bug reported'''
* The block being used to build does not show up unless it is a sapling.<ref>{{citation|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg201928#msg201928|title=Minecraft (alpha)|author=Navineous|website=Tigsource Forums |date=May 19, 2009|quote=I just found a glitch in the new version. In the top right corner my brick indication box is gone, it only shows up when I hit six and then it only shows I have a tree. But if I hit 1 2 3 or 4 it disappears. HELP! I'll post a screenshot soon.}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* The video released by Notch on May 18th showing off 0.0.12a is actually a developer variant that was never released to the public. See [[{{PAGENAME}}/Development|Development]] for more information on this.
* To make the water and lava texture display slightly shorter than a block, its texture from terrain.png gets shifted down a bit in-game. This causes the texture to overlap with the block below at some angles.
* The 0.0.13a-launcher jar contains the level generation files for this same version, which is also the same terrain generation files used in the full, public release of it (and 0.0.12a_01-03). It has variables that can enable and disable the uniform dirt layer, and it has been disabled for the public variant of 0.0.12a (or at least 0.0.12a_03 for certain). It also has variables for the water filling up the world from the corners, which can be disabled.
