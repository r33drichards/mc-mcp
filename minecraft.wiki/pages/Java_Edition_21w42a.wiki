'''21w42a''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on October 20, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w42a|October 20, 2021}}</ref> which introduces new music, changes to world generation, and many fixes related to spawning.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Music Disc Otherside JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Music disc]]'''
* Added the "[[otherside]]" music disc, composed by [[Lena Raine]].
** Can be found with a 2.5% chance in [[stronghold]] altar chests, or with a 3.1% chance in [[monster room]] chests.

=== General ===
'''[[Music]]'''
* Added new music to the [[Overworld]] (when playing in Survival mode), distributed to the new biomes, and to the [[main menu]].<ref group=note>Released to all 1.18 snapshots.</ref>
** By [[Lena Raine]]: "[[Stand Tall]]", "[[Left to Bloom]]", "[[One More Day]]", "[[Wending]]" and "[[Infinite Amethyst]]":
*** "[[Stand Tall]]" plays in the [[snowy slopes]], [[jagged peaks]], [[frozen peaks]] and [[stony peaks]] biomes, as well as the menu screen.
*** "[[Left to Bloom]]" plays in the [[meadow]] and [[lush caves]] biomes, as well as the menu screen.
*** "[[One More Day]]" plays in the meadow, snowy slopes and lush caves biomes, as well as the menu screen.
*** "[[Wending]]" plays in the [[grove]], jagged peaks, stony peaks and [[dripstone caves]] biomes, as well as the menu screen.
*** "[[Infinite Amethyst]]" plays in the grove and dripstone caves biomes, as well as the menu screen.
** By [[Kumi Tanioka]] (<span lang="ja">谷岡 久美</span>): "[[Floating Dream]]", "[[Comforting Memories]]" and "[[An Ordinary Day]]":
*** "[[Floating Dream]]" plays in the jagged peaks and lush caves biomes.
*** "[[Comforting Memories]]" plays in the grove biome.
*** "[[An Ordinary Day]]" plays in the snowy slopes, dripstone caves and lush caves biomes.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Autosave Indicator" to video settings, for [[singleplayer]] worlds, which allows to toggle the indicator on / off.
** The indicator appears in the bottom right of the screen whenever the game is saving the world file.
** Defaults to on.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added <code>block_marker</code>, to replace <code>light</code> and <code>barrier</code>.
** Renders with texture declared in <code>particle</code> slot for model assigned to configured block state.
** Summoned with same syntax as <code>block</code> particle (i.e. <code>block_marker wheat[age=2]</code>).

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Increased top height limit of [[badlands]] gold generation from Y=79 to Y=256, and increased the number of blobs.

'''[[Spring]]s'''
* Lava springs can now generate amid [[calcite]], [[dirt]], [[snow]], [[powder snow]] and [[packed ice]].
** These changes allow lava springs to generate in [[mountains]] and snowy terrain.
* Water springs don't generate higher than Y=192, and are slightly less common.

=== General ===
'''[[World spawn]]'''
* Reworked selection algorithm.
** Now is selected according to the same climate parameters that control biome placement and world generation: players should no longer spawn in the ocean or some other inconvenient locations like certain [[mountain]] biomes.{{testingame|More locations other than oceans that are considered inconvenient?}}
