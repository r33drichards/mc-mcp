'''21w18a''' is the twentieth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on May 5, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w18a|May 5, 2021}}</ref> which makes changes to goats and experimental ore generation, as well as fixes some bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Infested block]]s'''
* Instead of breaking instantly, they now take half of the time to break compared to their regular counterparts. They still have no assigned tool.<ref>{{bug|MC-224927|||Fixed}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-224972|||Fixed}}</ref>

'''[[Light Block|Light]]'''
* Changed the textures of the light block displayed in the inventory or when holding it.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Goat]]s'''
* Screaming goats now use their ram attack more often than other goats.
* The pitch for the sound of baby goats ramming into stuff has been increased.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added [[raw gold block]]s to the <code>guarded_by_piglins</code> block tag and the <code>piglin_loved</code> block tag.

'''[[Textures]]'''
* Removed the unused mouth textures from the [[axolotl]] textures.
* The [[goat]]'s two ear textures have been changed to mirror properly.

=== Experimental ===
Changes have been made to the official Caves & Cliffs world generation preview datapack, which gives early access to the world generation coming in [[Java Edition 1.18]].

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Cave carvers generate below Y=0 in [[ocean]] biomes.
* Increased the minimum size of noodle caves and carvers, to make them easier to traverse and less likely to break up into fragments.
* Noodle caves no longer generate above Y=30.

[[File:21w18a approximate ore distribution.jpg|thumb|Changes in the ore distribution.]]
'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Reduced [[copper ore]] spawning a bit, to compensate for large ore veins.
* Large [[ore vein]]s are slightly more rare and slightly smaller on average. They now vary significantly, meaning players can still find huge ore veins like the ones in previous versions.
* Increased chance of finding raw ore blocks in ore veins.
* Removed [[deepslate]] blobs above Y=0.
* Extended the vertical range of the smaller blobs of [[iron ore]], to make it possible to find iron in caves near the surface.
* Slightly reduced the amount of normal-sized iron blobs, to compensate for large ore veins and the increased range of smaller blobs.

== Trivia ==
* This snapshot lacked an image when the changelog was released on Minecraft.net. The alt text that appeared said "A goat standing on a hill. Very regal.". Image still can be accessed via the [https://www.minecraft.net/content/dam/games/minecraft/screenshots/snapshot-21w18a-header.jpg link] on the page.
* Ore distribution image contained hidden messages.
** The ore distribution chart has upside down black text in the deepslate area that said: "Yes the first message is still here, But{{sic}} upside down".
** A vertical line of text can be found in the coal area, saying "Someday I'm gonna run out of space to hide these messages".
** "We must stop messing like this!" can be found in the border of the new ore distributions image.
* This is the last snapshot which can be launched with Java 8 - Java 15.
