*** Fills at different rates depending on the new attack speed attribute (see table on the changes to gameplay section for a complete list).
**** The {{EffectLink|Haste}} effect causes the meter to fill faster.
*** Can be displayed next to the hotbar (left or right based on the player's main hand), under the crosshair or turned off.
**** Looks like the icon for the old {{EffectLink|Strength}} effect icon on the side of the hotbar, or like a dagger under the crosshair.
**** This is controlled in [[video settings]].

* Holding {{keys|shift}} and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them.
* A chest can be "locked" by setting its Lock tag using the {{cmd|/data}} command. If a chest's Lock tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named "Player's Key" can open the chest, use {{cmd|/data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:"Player's Key"} }}.
