A '''skin pack''' is a type of [[DLC|downloadable content]] that adds additional [[skin]]s for players to choose from along with the default skins included with the game's purchase. Skin packs are available in {{el|be}} as purchasable content on the [[Marketplace]]. They often feature characters from other video games, movies, and television shows, alongside original designs. Skin packs all have skins related to one another, e.g, a movie skin pack includes characters from only the designated movie. Skin packs are a way to quickly obtain several themed skins at once.

In addition to separately available skin packs, some [[mash-up pack]]s and downloadable worlds come bundled with skin packs as well.

Custom skin packs can be created and imported to the game with a data system similar to [[resource packs]] and [[behavior packs]].

== Package format ==
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}

Custom skin packs use a package format which contains multiple [[skins]] for the players and loaded by the game under the {{cd|[[com.mojang]]/development_skin_packs}} directory. It is defined in {{cd|[[manifest.json]]}} with the {{cd|skin_pack}} module, and contains {{cd|skins.json}} and [[localization]] files for defining skin entries. When a custom skin pack is loaded by the game, it appears as a skin pack below the custom skin on the "Classic Skins" menu of the [[Dressing Room]].

Zipped skin packs can be distributed with the {{cd|.mcpack}} [[File extensions|file extension]]. Opening a skin pack file will automatically import it to {{cd|com.mojang/skin_packs}} and it appears in the Dressing Room.

=== Directory structure ===
<div class="treeview">
{{File|directory|''name''}} or {{File|archive|''name''.zip}}
** {{File|file|geometry.json}}: Specifies the models of each geometry type. Only used in internal skin packs.
** {{File|file|[[manifest.json]]}}: Skin packs use the {{cd|skin_pack}} type.
** {{File|file|skins.json}}: Defines skin entries stored in the pack.
** {{File|file|''skin''.png}}. A skin file. Multiple skin files can be stored in a pack.
** {{File|directory|texts}}: Defines names for the skins in-game, which can be translated.
*** {{File|file|languages.json}}. Specifies all languages used.
*** {{File|file|''<languagecode>''_''<COUNTRYCODE>''.lang}}. A language file for localization. Multiple language files can be used.
</div>
=== skins.json ===

The {{cd|skins.json}} file is used to define skin entries later loaded by the game. The following interface is used for {{cd|skin.json}}:

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}}: The root tag.
** {{nbt|string|localization_name}}: The skin pack name used for language localization for the skin's display name.

=== Localization ===

The localization files for skin pack may be defined under {{cd|texts}} directory. For example, {{cd|texts/en_US.lang}} defines localization for players with American English language set in their [[settings]].

The following key name format applies for skin pack localization:

* {{cd|skin.''serialize_name''.''skin_localization_name''}} for defining a skin's name.

* {{cd|skinpack.''serialize_name''}} for defining the skin pack's name.
* {{cd|skinpack.''serialize_name''.by}} for defining the author's name.

Both ''<code>serialize_name</code>'' and ''<code>skin_localization_name</code>'' are defined in the {{cd|skins.json}} file as specified above.

=== Internal skin packs ===
An internal skin pack is used for the default skins, which uses the same directory structrure as custom skin packs. Internal skin packs can be found at {{Cd|[[Microsoft.MinecraftUWP]]/data/skin_packs}}.
