'''''Minecraft: Java Edition''''' (formerly just '''''Minecraft'''''<ref group="note">Subtitle present since [[Java Edition 1.12.2|1.12.2]]. Also formerly titled '''''Cave Game''''' and '''''Minecraft: Order of the Stone''''' during private testing in [[Pre-Classic]].</ref>) is the original version of ''[[Minecraft]]'', developed by [[Mojang Studios]] for {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}}, {{w|macOS}}, and {{w|Linux}}. [[Notch]] began development on ''Minecraft'' on May 10, 2009, and publicly released it a week later on May 17, 2009. The [[#Full release|full release]] (version [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]]) was released on November 18, 2011, at [[MINECON 2011]].

== Unique features ==
{{main|Java Edition exclusive features}}
Updates are managed directly by the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'', so it does not have to go through platform holders' certification. 

Logging in with a Microsoft account is required to use the launcher and play the game. In addition to the latest version and latest snapshot, most past versions of ''Java Edition'' are also available through the launcher. The launcher allows for separate profiles that are useful for mods, [[development versions]], and old versions.

''Java Edition'''s code is more easily modifiable, and so it has by far the most robust scenes for [[mods]] and [[mcservers:Java Edition server software|custom servers]]. One example of this is the addition of the [[obfuscation map]]<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|1168818898101293056|Tomorrow's snapshot has a small surprise for modders! Should make one or two people happy :)|3 September 2019}}</ref>, which is intended to make modding easier. As such, the code has been extensively examined by the modding community, and therefore is highly documented - one example being the [[Java Edition protocol]] documentation. [[Realms]] for ''Java Edition'' is a separate subscription from the two Realms subscriptions for ''Bedrock Edition''.

The Windows versions of ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition'' are sold together as '''''Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC'''''<ref>{{Link|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/articles/6657208607501|title=Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition for PC FAQ|website=Minecraft.net|date=June 7, 2022}}</ref> and '''''Minecraft: Java & Bedrock Edition Deluxe Collection''''' (the latter includes DLC for ''Bedrock Edition''). Previously, owners of ''Java Edition'' who bought the game before June 7, 2022 would also receive a free copy of ''Bedrock Edition''.

=== Creation/Pre-classic ===
{{main|Java Edition Pre-classic}}
[[File:CaveGame.png|300px|thumbnail|right|[[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-131655|Cave game tech test]]]]

[[Notch]] got the idea for ''Minecraft'' after playing ''[[Infiniminer]]'' with other members of the [https://tigsource.com TIGSource] forums in 2009.<ref>[https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.0 "Minecraft (alpha)"] – TIGSource Forums, May 17, 2009</ref> Other influences include ''{{w|Dwarf Fortress}}'', ''{{w|Dungeon Keeper}}'',<ref>{{tweet|notch|76378826137018369|Dungeon Keeper is available at gog.com right now! It's one of the inspirations for Minecraft|June 3, 2011}}</ref> and Notch's own previous project, ''[[RubyDung]]''.<ref>[[wordofnotch:227922045|The origins of Minecraft]] – The Word of Notch, October 30, 2009</ref>

When he first started working on ''Minecraft'', Notch had planned for it to just be a small project. For instance, when Notch uploaded the first [[YouTube]] video of ''Minecraft'' on May 13, 2009, he had not yet decided on a name, and simply referred to it as a "cave game".<ref>[[wordofnotch:107315028|Cave Game tech demo!]] – The Word of Notch, May 13, 2009</ref><ref>[{{ytl|F9t3FREAZ-k}} Cave game tech test] – YouTube ([http://web.archive.org/web/20150501040204/https://youtube.com/watch?v=F9t3FREAZ-k Archive])</ref> The name '''''Minecraft: Order of the Stone''''' was announced the next day<ref>[[wordofnotch:107676487|Minecraft: Order of the Stone]] – The Word of Notch, May 14, 2009</ref> (from a suggestion a [https://tigsource.com TIGSource] forums user gave in an IRC chat<ref>{{citation|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg201261#msg201261|title=Re: Minecraft alpha|website=TIGSource Forums|date=May 18, 2009}}</ref>), a reference to ''[[wikipedia:The_Order_of_the_Stick|The Order of the Stick]]'', a webcomic and "one of the best things on the internet", and then shortly after, it was shortened to '''''Minecraft''''' as it was much simpler and to prevent people from confusing it with ''The Order of the Stick''. The name was [[Minecraft Story Mode:Order of the Stone|later used]] for ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''. The game was finally released for an "early private single-player alpha" on May 16, 2009.<ref>[[wordofnotch:108652448|Early private singleplayer alpha coming very soon]] – The Word of Notch, May 16, 2009, </ref> Today, the majority of all pre-classic versions are lost.

=== Classic ===
{{main|Java Edition Classic}}
[[File:Classic.png|300px|thumbnail|right|[[Java Edition Classic|''Minecraft'' Classic]]]]

''Minecraft'' 0.0.11a was publicly released the day after the private release on May 17, 2009,<ref>[[wordofnotch:109000107|Minecraft 0.0.11a for public consumption]] – The Word of Notch, May 17, 2009</ref> and the game received mention on [https://IndieGames.com IndieGames.com] the day after that.<ref>{{citation|url=https://indiegamesplus.com/2009/05/browser_game_pick_minecraft_ma|author=Tim W|website=IndieGames.com|title=Browser Game Pick: Minecraft (Markus Persson)|date=May 17, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521094357/http://indiegames.com/blog/2009/05/browser_game_pick_minecraft_ma.html}}</ref> This phase was later named ''Minecraft'' Classic.<ref>[[wordofnotch:746938105|The server is back up!]] – The Word of Notch, June 28, 2010, </ref> In July, ''Minecraft'' was rewritten to use the [http://lwjgl.org Lightweight Java Gaming Library (LWJGL)].<ref>[[wordofnotch:143020675|I think I know what game I’m making]] – The Word of Notch, July 16, 2009, </ref> Until ''Minecraft'' [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] reintroduced it, Classic was the only version of ''Minecraft'' with the [[Creative]] game mode, which gives players an infinite amount of each block to build with without having to gather them as in [[Survival]] mode. A multiplayer test also occurred shortly before the Survival test.

==== Survival Test ====
{{main|Java Edition Survival Test}}

Survival Test was released as a version of Classic on September 1, 2009. It was the introduction of Survival Mode. In it, the player now had to mine blocks, face [[mobs]], and had a health bar. If the player were to die, the map was lost; unless backed up, the user would have to start over with a new map, similar to [[Hardcore]] mode.

=== Indev ===
{{main|Java Edition Indev}} 
[[File:Indev.png|thumbnail|300px|right|[[Indev]]]]

Indev (short for <u>in</u> <u>dev</u>elopment) was released on December 23, 2009, after Notch received requests to let the community try out new features he was implementing in Survival Test. Indev version 0.31 was released to the public on minecraft.net/indev and available only to people who had purchased the game. When a new game was started, the player would spawn in a prefabricated wooden house. 

Updates introduced a more complex and realistic [[light]]ing scheme than [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]], as well as a [[daylight cycle|day-night cycle]]. Indev received more updates after this, adding a few fundamental features to ''Minecraft'' as it went. During its lifespan, some updates were devoted mostly to testing new things, like food, [[torch]]es, or fire. The [[difficulty]] settings: Peaceful, Easy, Normal and Hard, were added to the game. Unique to Indev were level types, similar to [[biome]]s and [[dimension]]s - for example, Floating Islands and the [[Sky Dimension]], and "Hell" (not the Nether). Like Survival Test, if the player were to die, all progress was lost.

=== Infdev ===
{{main|Java Edition Infdev}}
[[File:Infdev 20100618.png|thumbnail|300px|right|[[Infdev]]]]

Infdev (short for <u>inf</u>inite <u>dev</u>elopment)<ref>{{tweet|notch|1372513921404387329|The way I remember it, it was the name of the branch I set up to test out infinite terrain size. The normal one being, of course, "indev", so it was clever wordplay. No real thought put into any meaning beyond that, I think.|March 18, 2021}}</ref> was released on February 27, 2010, and became the third phase of ''Minecraft''{{'}}s development. It featured the important addition of maps that can generate infinitely, which extended the gameplay possibilities even further as well as other upgrades including new [[Crafting|crafting recipes]], 3D [[clouds]], a new terrain generator, a more realistic [[fluid]] system, and more complex caves. However, Infdev scrapped other features of Indev such as [[Theme|world themes]]. This, in turn, spelled the demise of features such as 'floating islands' and 'permaday'. These removals are understandable, as Infdev's main purpose was to develop infinite maps. However, some extra gameplay features and items were added, such as [[minecart]]s, [[dungeon]]s with [[mob spawner]]s, and the ability to [[respawn]].

After being replaced by Alpha on June 30, 2010, Infdev remained available on the official ''Minecraft'' website until September 2010, when it was removed. Only one version, [[Infdev 20100618]], is playable through the launcher, by enabling the "Historical versions" button in the Launcher options.

=== Alpha ===
{{main|Java Edition Alpha}}
[[File:OldNether.png|300px|thumbnail|right|[[The Nether]] in [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]]]]

Alpha was released on June 30, 2010, however, only technically, as the first version labeled as Alpha was [[Alpha v1.0.1]]. When this update was released, Notch decided to rename [[Infdev (June 30, 2010)]] to [[Alpha v1.0.0]]. This phase of the game saw many major features added to ''Minecraft''. Multiplayer for Survival was created, and features such as [[redstone circuits]], [[boat]]s, new [[music]], and new mobs, often without announcement in "[[Seecret Updates|Seecret Friday Updates]]".

The [[Halloween Update]] on October 30, 2010, was a major update adding [[biome]]s, [[The Nether]], new mobs, blocks and items, and other changes.

One could see Alpha's introduction of [[biome]]s as being the return, at least in part, of Indev's [[Theme|world themes]], and indeed the Nether is not unlike the 'Hell' world theme. 
Another reintroduction in Alpha was the return of [[multiplayer]]. Unlike Classic's Creative multiplayer, Alpha's multiplayer was available only in [[Survival]] form that is logically called "Survival Multiplayer".

It is still playable on the launcher by enabling the "Historical versions" button in the Launch options. Today, 23% of all Alpha versions are lost.

=== Beta ===
{{main|Java Edition Beta}}
[[File:Beta.png|300px|thumbnail|right|[[Java Edition Beta|Beta]]]]

Beta was the sixth and last phase of ''Minecraft''{{'}}s development before its official release. Beta was released on December 20, 2010. Features that were added include a new logo and launcher, customizable world name and [[world seed]], [[achievement/Java Edition|achievements]] and [[statistics]], [[weather]], [[Light#Smooth lighting|Smooth Lighting]], [[dyes]], more plant types (two new types of [[tree]]s and tall [[grass]]), [[wolves]] and [[squid]], [[bed]]s, and other blocks and items.

The [[Adventure Update]] was a major set of updates, focusing on exploring and combat and adding an ending to the game. Features added include a new terrain generator, new mobs, blocks, biomes, and items. Three generated structures were added: [[village]]s, [[stronghold]]s, and [[mineshaft]]s. Changes to general [[gameplay]] include an improved [[combat]] system including [[critical hit]]s and [[experience]], a reintroduced [[Creative]], [[Hardcore]], and a way to finish the game by traveling to [[The End]] and defeating the [[ender dragon]].

Originally planned to be started in Beta 1.7, the first part of the Adventure Update was released as Beta 1.8 on September 14, 2011. Starting on September 9, 2011, [[Java Edition version history/Development versions|developmental versions]] were "leaked" by Mojang Studios.<ref>{{tweet|notch|112269453621862401|Ooh, looks like 1.8 has leaked, not that I'd ever admit that. ;) Be careful when installing software you don't trust though.|September 10, 2011}}</ref> Beta 1.9 was never released, but 6 pre-releases using the 1.9 version number were made available for users to test and report bugs back to Mojang Studios. On October 18, a feature freeze went into effect and Mojang Studios shifted all ''Minecraft'' development focus to fixing bugs and preparing the game for release.<ref>{{tweet|notch|126319481160081408|Now one month of polish and bug fixed and performance tweaks and optimizations. "Fun!"|October 19, 2011}}</ref> On November 13, a release candidate of 1.0 was released, along with an official update to 1.8.1 that added sounds from the developmental version.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324123216/http://minecraftforum.net/news/313-minecraft-rc2-is-out-for-testing|title=Minecraft RC2 is Out For Testing|author=Sacheverell|website=Minecraft Forum|date=November 13, 2011}}</ref>

It is still playable on the launcher by enabling the "Historical versions" button in the Launch options.

[[File:TheEnderdragon.png|300px|thumbnail|right|The [[ender dragon]] in [[the End]].]]

The full release of ''Minecraft'', [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]], was released during [[MINECON 2011]] on November 18, 2011, by [[Notch]] at the keynote address ceremony at 9:54 pm {{w|UTC}}. [[Jeb]] confirmed the version number in a tweet while also stating that the game would be officially out of Beta.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|128826347178049536|The next official release will be 1.0 again, and will be released during Minecon|October 25, 2011}}</ref> The release includes many features from the [[Adventure Update]] that were not included in [[Beta 1.8]]. The most prominent feature is an ending to the game, which can be achieved by defeating the Ender Dragon boss in The End.

The full release of ''Minecraft'' is charged at full price ({{w|United States dollar|US$}}29.99, {{w|Canadian dollar|Can$}}39.99, {{w|Euro|€}}29.99, {{w|Pound sterling|£}}24.99, {{w|Australian dollar|A$}}39.95, {{w|New Zealand dollar|NZ$}}49.95, or {{w|Singapore dollar|S$}}39.90) to new players, but Alpha and Beta players receive this copy through regular updating. After the release, Notch said in an interview that he was nervous about releasing a full game that would be rated and reviewed. Upon release, the game was well received and was given high ratings by many gaming websites and fan reviews.

Subsequent updates have since been released, with additions such as new gameplay mechanics, new mobs, and biomes. For the full list of additions since 1.0.0, see [[Java Edition version history]].

The game received the ''Java Edition'' subtitle in [[Java Edition 1.12.2]], to separate it from {{BE}}, which was renamed to just "''Minecraft''" by the [[Better Together Update]].

On October 6, 2018, Mojang Studios open-sourced parts of the code for ''Java Edition'', mainly the [[Brigadier]] command engine and the Data Fixer Upper. A complete rewrite of the game's rendering engine called Blaze3D is being considered for open-sourcing.<ref>{{Mcnet|programmers-play-minecrafts-inner-workings|Programmers: Play with Minecraft's Inner Workings!|October 6, 2018|[[Tom Stone]]}}</ref>

== Demo version ==
{{main|Demo Mode}}
The [[demo version]] of ''Java Edition'' is for players who haven't bought Minecraft yet and has some restrictions:

* The demo version is always set to [[Survival|survival mode]]
* Only one world is created: ''(Demo_World)''.
* The world generates using the same [[Seed (world generation)|seed]]: {{code|-343522682}}.
* The [[player]] has limited time to play the world (when the timer goes to 0, the player can still play, but they can't interact with the world).
* The player's name is always set to {{code|Player}}.
* The player gets a [[bonus chest]] when starting a new demo world.

== Controls ==
{{main|Controls#Java Edition}}

Controls for the ''Java Edition'' are designed for use with a keyboard and mouse, touchscreen, or touchpad.

== System requirements ==

The game can run on a lot of hardware, including low end systems like mobile Intel Core 2 Duo from 2007.<ref name=":0">Own testing with Core 2 Duo T7400 (2.16GHz, [[wikipedia:Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]] architecture), integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics and 4GB of RAM, with [[Java Edition 1.21.10|1.21.10]] on [[wikipedia:Ubuntu|Ubuntu]] 24.04.3.</ref> However, for an enjoyable experience, it is encouraged to consult the recommended requirements.

The below requirements are adapted from [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-deluxe-collection-pc#accordionv1-b6c8df09da-item-6176600103 the official requirements] and are meant for unmodified versions of the game. [[Mods]] and [[resource pack]]s can have significantly higher requirements, complex worlds might also require better hardware to run well.

Java 21 is required. However, the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' automatically supplies the correct Java version by default, removing the need to install it separately.

Recent versions of ''Java Edition'' are not compatible with 32-bit operating systems. The latest version of ''Java Edition'' that can be played on a 32-bit operating system is [[Java Edition 1.20.4]].

A stable Internet connection is required for the launcher to download game files, authenticate usernames, and for the game to connect to multiplayer servers. The player must download and run ''Java Edition'' while connected to the internet at least once; afterward, the player can play without an internet connection, but must still connect to receive updates or play online.

The latest version of game requires the following to run in any capacity:

* Java SE 21 runtime
* 64-bit operating system
* Several native libraries, including [[LWJGL]], and a suitable environment (for example LWJGL requires compatible windowing and audio systems to run)
* An OpenGL 4.4 compatible graphics card and driver

Officially, only Linux, macOS Mojave (10.14.5) or later and Windows 7 or later are supported, but it might be possible to run ''Java Edition'' on other platforms by unofficial means.

* Can run on ChromeOS using its Linux compatibility layer via the official launcher for Linux (see [[Tutorial:Java Edition on ChromeOS|this tutorial]])
* Can't run using Java ME, included in devices such as cars or Blu-ray players
* Can run on Android and iOS using third-party solutions such as [https://github.com/AngelAuraMC Amethyst]

Information on system requirements for running a ''Java Edition'' server can be found on the [[Server/Requirements]] page.

''Minecraft: Java Edition'' was first made available for sale in June 2009 and has since sold over 30 million copies. ''Minecraft'' has received high acclaim from critics and has since become one of the most influential and successful indie games ever released. The game's popularity has influenced the creation of a new genre of Minecraft clones.<ref>{{citation|url=https://gameslikefinder.com/games-like-minecraft/|title=59 Games Like Minecraft|website=Games Finder}}</ref>

== Trailer ==
{{main|Official Minecraft Trailer}}
An official trailer was released on Mojang Studios's official YouTube channel after the full release of Minecraft, on December 6, 2011. The video was made by Vareide instead of Hat Films, who have made update trailers and videos for Mojang Studios in the past.

Previously, another trailer also made by Vareide was featured on the Minecraft website:

== Trivia ==
*Before being renamed to ''Java Edition'' in 1.12.2, this edition was often informally called the "PC Edition" or "Computer Edition", to differentiate it from other versions run on mobile and console platforms which were later united under ''Bedrock Edition''.
*The source code of ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' may have been hosted in a private repository called "Mojang/Minecraft" on GitHub, which [[Bartosz Bok]] has referred to during [[Brigadier]]'s development before its open-source release.<ref>{{link|url=https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier/pull/6|title=Pass StringReader instead of strings to CommandDispatcher by boq · Pull Request #6 · Mojang/brigadier|website=GitHub|quote=This is part of cleanup for / handling on code (Mojang/Minecraft@6f28ed1).|date=Jul 23, 2018}}</ref>
*The ''Java Edition'' page on [[Minecraft.net]] uses screenshots from ''Bedrock Edition''.<ref>{{citation|url=https://minecraft.net/store/minecraft-java-edition|title=Minecraft Java Edition|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref>
* The official Java website has a page linking to [[Minecraft.net]].<ref name="java" />
