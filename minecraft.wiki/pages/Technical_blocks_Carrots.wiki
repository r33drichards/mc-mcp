|{{HistoryLine||1.4.2|dev=12w34a|Carrots have an extra, unobtainable item form corresponding to its block ID. It can be obtained via the {{cmd|give}} command or inventory editors with numeric item ID 141.
|Unlike the proper carrot item, it had a placement sound, and was capable of directly replacing replaceable blocks such as grass provided it would result in a valid placement.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w25a|The direct item form of carrots has been removed from the game. It can no longer exist as an item in any way, only as a placed block.}}

|{{HistoryLine||v0.8.0|dev=build 1|Carrots exist as an item.}}
