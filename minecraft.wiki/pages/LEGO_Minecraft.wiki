[[File:LEGO Micro World.png|thumb|The first ''LEGO Minecraft'' set.]]
'''''LEGO Minecraft''''' is a licensed ''{{w|LEGO}}'' theme of sets based on ''[[Minecraft]]''.

== Set information ==
There are four main types of sets - the "Micro World" sets, each made up of four modules which are each 6×6 studs in size, the normal ''LEGO'' minifigure scale sets, the "Big Fig" sets, each consisting of two brick-built mobs at a scale of approximately two pixels per stud, and the {{Wikipedia|Lego BrickHeadz|BrickHeadz}} sets, smaller, more stylized and less poseable brick-built figures. Currently, only the minifigure-scale sets are in production.

The normal ''LEGO Minecraft'' sets each feature different parts of ''Minecraft''. All the sets include either one of the nine [[player]] skins (So far [[Steve]], [[Alex]], [[Sunny]], and [[Efe]] have been released with [[Makena]] soon to be released), or a specialized "[[skin]]" for a given situation, and at least one mob. For example, "The Cave" features a cave in ''Minecraft'' with different [[ore]]s and [[mob]]s, "The Farm" features a normal crop farm with one [[cow]], [[sheep]], and a [[skeleton]], and "The First Night" features a basic house and a farm with a [[pig]] and a [[creeper]]. All sets follow this theme of representing a specific natural or player-made location meant to approximate something a player might build or encounter, featuring decor and mobs appropriate for that environment.

The original ''Micro World'' set centered around Steve and a creeper. The scene is depicted in the [[Overworld]] and depicts a few biomes, including a [[mountain]], [[cave]]s, [[forest]], and [[plains]]. ''The Village'' features structures in the [[village]], and a [[mineshaft]]. It includes blocks for constructing houses, along with the [[pig]], [[villager]], and [[zombie]] figures. ''The Nether'' is a stylized depiction of [[the Nether]], and contains a [[lava]] sea, a lava stream flowing down a hill, a [[nether fortress]], and a [[nether portal]] to connect to the Overworld. It also includes two [[ghast]]s and a [[zombie pigman]]. ''The End'' is a stylised depiction of [[the End]], and contains the [[Ender Dragon]], six end spikes with [[end crystal]]s on top of them, an [[exit portal]], and [[endermen]].

One ''Minecraft'' block is represented as a 2&times;2 brick with a tile on top. ''LEGO'' states that this is not a perfect cube, but it is "the best approximation at the chosen scale."{{Citation needed}}

== History ==
When asked about ''LEGO Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s beginnings, Mojang chief executive officer [[Carl Manneh]] stated that "it was one of the first things we talked about when we started Mojang."<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Minecraft</ref>

In December 2011, [[Mojang Studios]] started a project on the LEGO Ideas program (then known as "LEGO Cuusoo"), which requires 10,000 signatures for a project to be approved. With the strong support of the ''Minecraft'' community, the 10,000 signature objective was achieved in under three days,<ref>[https://ideas.lego.com/projects/11fb03f1-7fd6-47d5-bef7-a39763a523bf LEGO MINECRAFT] - LEGO IDEAS; December 5, 2011</ref><ref name="LegoMinecraft">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130907025044/http://blog.lego.cuusoo.com/2012/01/24/minecraft-lego-cuusoo-project-passes-lego-rev-54968/ Minecraft™ LEGO® CUUSOO Project Passes LEGO Review] - LEGO CUUSOO; January 24, 2012</ref> and the development of the ''LEGO Minecraft'' set commenced after LEGO reviewed the project. [[Mojang Studios]] promised to donate 1% of the proceeds to charity.<ref name="LegoMinecraft" /> The first set was subsequently released on June 1, 2012.<ref>[http://shop.lego.com/Minecraft-21102 LEGO store page]</ref>

The second and third sets, ''The Village'' and ''The Nether'', were announced at Comic-Con 2013.<ref name="village-nether">[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57591673-235/lego-doubles-down-on-minecraft/ Lego doubles down on Minecraft] - CNET; July 17, 2013</ref> The fourth set, ''The End'', was announced through a teaser on March 8,<ref>https://facebook.com/photo.php?v=686778491386896&set=vb.250707394994010&type=2&theater</ref> followed by a reveal on March 14 on the ''LEGO Minecraft'' Facebook page.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190710064958/https://facebook.com/LEGOMinecraft/photos/a.299460193452063.72516.250707394994010/690343807697031/?type=1&theater</ref>

On 2 November 2013, during [[MINECON]], it was announced that The LEGO Group would be creating a fully fledged minifigure-scale theme, and that they would be seeking feedback from ''Minecraft'' players on designing these sets. This was the first time that LEGO would work together with fans to create a new series of sets. This initiative was referred to as the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCmJemgGGwI co-build project].

The first six of these minifigure-scale sets were released on 15 November 2014. These were the first sets that did not follow the "Micro World" design of the previous sets. Another four sets were unveiled at the 2015 London Toy Fair.<ref name="2015sets" /> These sets were released on 15 August 2015. Subsequent sets have continued to be released up until the present.

== Trivia ==
*The first set ''Micro World - The Forest'' was released on [[Markus Persson]]'s birthday.
*The first page of the building instructions of ''Micro World - The Forest''<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.lego.com/cdn/product-assets/product.bi.core.pdf/6088383.pdf|title=21102_BK1 - 6088383.pdf|website=LEGO.com}}</ref> features a paragraph of text explaining what ''Minecraft'' is. This paragraph is a verbatim copy of the "About ''Minecraft''" section on the wiki's [[Special:PermanentLink/164361|revision 164361]] of [[Minecraft Wiki|Main Page]].
*In the illustration on the first page of the early instructions, [[Herobrine]] is present.
* The Boxes for the first four sets are each styled after a different building block: ''Micro World'' resembles a [[grass block]], ''The Village'' resembles [[oak planks]], ''The Nether'' resembles lava, and ''The End'' resembles [[obsidian]].
* Early versions of the official page displayed the three Micro-World sets available at the time. It also featured LEGO [[dirt]] blocks that could be broken when clicked on which had a chance of displaying a diamond or an emerald. When those were clicked on, it would display the text "Congratulations! You found the hidden LEGO Minecraft wallpaper" with a redirect to one of the two available wallpapers.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.lego.com/en-us/minecraft?icmp=COUSFR38Minecraft|title=LEGO.com Minecraft Home|website=LEGO.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302221607/http://www.lego.com/en-us/minecraft?icmp=COUSFR38Minecraft}}</ref>

*During 2011 and 2012, Mojang was co-developing a video game with The LEGO Group called ''[[Brickcraft]]''. Mojang cancelled the collaboration early in development to focus on developing their own games.
