'''''Minecraft Education''''' (formerly known as '''''Minecraft: Education Edition''''') is an educational version of {{BE}} specifically designed for classroom use. It is developed by [[Mojang Studios]] and {{w|Xbox Game Studios}} and has features that make ''[[Minecraft]]'' easy to use in a classroom setting. The full game was released on November 1, 2016,<ref name=EducationBlogPost/> but was however announced on January 19, 2016.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609143426/http://mojang.com/2016/01/announcing-minecraft-education-edition/|title=Announcing Minecraft: Education Edition|author=Owen Hill|date=January 19, 2016|website=Mojang}}</ref> There was a beta test between June 9 and November 1, 2016.{{cn}}

On August 20, 2018, Mojang Studios announced that it would bring ''Minecraft Education'' to {{w|iPadOS}} in Autumn 2018.<ref>{{citation|url=https://education.minecraft.net/ipad|title=Minecraft Education Now Available for iPad|website=education.minecraft.net}}</ref> Microsoft stated that licensed users would be able to play starting in September.<ref>[https://educationblog.microsoft.com/2018/08/minecraft-education-edition-ipad-whats-new-in-edu What's New in EDU: Minecraft: Education Edition expands to iPad - August 20. 2018]</ref> It was released to the App Store on September 6, 2018.

On March 27, 2019, it was announced that ''Minecraft Education'' in mainland China would be operated by {{w|JD.com}}.<ref>{{link |url=https://technode.com/2019/03/28/jd-cloud-lands-exclusive-rights-to-minecraft-education-edition-in-china |title=JD Cloud lands exclusive rights to 'Minecraft: Education Edition' in China |website=TechNode |author=Nicole Jao |date=March 28, 2019}}</ref> In January 2022, operation by JD.com came to an end. In August 2023, a subsidiary of [[NetEase]], {{w|Youdao}}, reacquired rights to ''Minecraft Education'' in mainland China, and introduced ''Minecraft Education Personal'', including a preview for ''Minecraft Education Personal'' for {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}} and {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}} devices.<ref>{{citation|url=https://meec.meta.youdaozhixue.com|title=Minecraft Education Personal - Official Website|website=meec.meta.youdaozhixue.com}}</ref> Operations of ''Minecraft Education Personal'' shut down in August 2024.

On June 26, 2020, an ''Education Edition Public Beta'' was made available to {{w|Google Play}} compatible {{w|ChromeOS}} devices. The full game was released on Google Play for compatible ChromeOS devices on August 7, 2020.<ref>{{citation|url=https://education.minecraft.net/chromebook|title=Minecraft Education for Chromebook|website=education.minecraft.net}}</ref>

== Features ==
{{main|Minecraft Education exclusive features}}''Minecraft Education'' is based on {{BE}}.<ref>{{reddit|41o4gd/announcing_minecraft_education_edition|cz42o0j|We'll try at first to bring them back to PE/Win10 as that's a lot easier since it's the same codebase, but of course anything we bring back should make sense for PC as well!|mojang_tommo}}</ref> ''Minecraft Education'' has many features that makes ''Minecraft'' more accessible and effective in a classroom setting. These features include:
* Classroom collaboration: ''Minecraft Education'' has no limit to how many students can join a server, allowing the whole class to join one server to collaborate.
* Non-player characters: An educator may create an [[NPC]] to act as a guide for students in the game. They can provide instructions or more information, and allow educators to insert an active web link to additional references.
* [[Camera]] + [[portfolio]]: The camera and portfolio features allow students to take screenshots of their work and document the development of their projects.
* [[Chalkboard]]s: Creators can use chalkboards to communicate learning goals, provide additional information, and give explicit instructions within the game. Chalkboards come in three different sizes – 1×1, 2×1, and 3×2.
* Tutorial world: For educators or students new to ''Minecraft'', a tutorial world is available that guides players on in-game navigation, crafting, and placing or breaking blocks.
* [[Allow and deny]] blocks: These blocks allow the educator (or a player with World Builder privileges) to place specific areas where players can or cannot build.
* [[Border]] blocks: These blocks prevent players from entering or leaving a specific area. The range of influence extends the full range of the Y coordinate from wherever the block is placed on the X & Z coordinates. Note: These blocks can be bypassed using ender pearls or chorus fruit.
* Classroom mode: This is a complimentary program to ''Minecraft Education'' and allows educators a master view of the map (including the locations of all players), to communicate with players via chat (and monitor the chat), and turn off/on some world settings.
* Code builder and the [[Agent]]: A complimentary program to ''Minecraft Education'' that allows students to write code in a code editor and the Agent then executes the code in the program.
* The {{cmd|ability}} command: Allows the player to modify permissions of players such as the {{code|World Builder}} permission, which allows players to build. {{code|MayFly}} allows the player to enable/disable fly in all game modes, and {{code|mute}} allows the player to mute another player. Abilities are similar to gamerules, except they apply to a player rather than the entire world.
* The {{code|Immutable}} World gamerule: A rule that prevents any players who are not creators (or who don't have World Builder permissions) from breaking or placing any blocks unless they are on top of an [[allow]] block.

* Exclusive items and blocks, such as [[ice bomb]]s, [[underwater TNT]], and [[underwater torch]]es. These exclusive items are made with the Chemistry Set, which are located in the Creative menu.
== Lesson plans ==
Lesson plans through ''Minecraft Education'' are available to download and are split between certain age groups and various subjects such as history, visual arts, and gaming<!-- Yes, that is an actual subject! -->. Additionally, educators can upload lesson plans that they have created for others to use from the main website.

== Pricing ==
The full game costs US$ 5.04 (US$4.99 on the Apple App Store) per user per year to use,{{cn}} depending on school size and if qualifications for volume licensing are met. Volume pricing for school-wide deployments and large-scale academic institutions is also planned. Users not part of an official educational institution can buy a Commercial License for $36 per user per year, and it is also offered for a monthly price of $3 per user per month. Schools and districts that already have ''MinecraftEdu'' can get ''Minecraft Education'' for free.

It was announced on May 2, 2017, that schools and educational institutions that purchase new Windows 10 devices receive a free year of ''Minecraft Education''.<ref>{{tweet|MicrosoftEDU|859407253157412865|Receive one-year subscription to @playcraftlearn when purchasing a new #Windows10 device through your school #MicrosoftEdu|May 2, 2017}}</ref>
