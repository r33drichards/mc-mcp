'''Chorus fruit''' is a [[food]] item native to [[the End]] that can be eaten, or [[smelt]]ed into [[popped chorus fruit]]. It can be eaten even when the hunger bar is full, and eating it may teleport the [[player]] up to 8 blocks in any direction.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mining ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Chorus fruit farming}}
Chorus fruit can be obtained by breaking [[chorus plant]] blocks. Each block of chorus plant has a 50% chance to drop a chorus fruit. This is not affected by [[Fortune]].<ref>{{bug|MC-198924||Chorus Fruit doesn't have a higher chance with Fortune|Invalid}}</ref>

== Usage ==

=== Eating ===
To eat chorus fruit, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|4}} [[hunger]] and 2.4 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

Unlike most foods, chorus fruits can be eaten when the player has a full hunger bar.

=== Teleportation ===
The player may also be [[teleportation|teleported]]: up to 16 attempts are made to choose a random destination within ±8 on all three axes in the same manner as [[Enderman#Teleportation|enderman teleportation]], with the exception that the player may teleport into an area only 2 blocks high, or one block tall if the player is crawling. The player does not land in the average centroid of the block, but rather to any position within an 8-block range. If there are no valid blocks within this range, the teleportation attempt fails and the player remains in place. The player is teleported directly down to the ground regardless of the height it was used at if the player is too far from a valid destination.

The chorus fruit, unlike an [[ender pearl]], can teleport the player through [[solid block]]s. The algorithm tries to avoid [[fluid]]s; the player cannot teleport into a space occupied by [[water]] or [[lava]]. However, the player can be teleported onto dangerous blocks such as fire, cacti and magma blocks.<ref>{{bug|MC-102836||Enderman and chorus fruit can teleport to some dangerous places}}</ref>

If a teleport succeeds, a sound similar to an enderman teleporting plays originating from the teleportation origin location. Chorus fruit has a cooldown of 1 second before being able to be used again. The cooldown is represented by a white overlay on the chorus fruit in the hotbar. The cooldown is applied to all chorus fruits items, including those in the player's inventory and containers.<ref>{{bug|MC-88236|||WAI}}</ref>

Eating chorus fruit removes all [[fall damage]], regardless of the distance the player has fallen.

Eating chorus fruit may teleport the player into areas protected by [[bedrock]], [[barrier]] blocks, or other blocks that are otherwise unbreakable in [[Survival]] mode. However, it cannot teleport the player onto the [[Nether roof]].<ref>{{bug|MC-84198|||Fixed}}</ref>

Chorus fruit is completely non-functional above the Nether roof.

[[Fox]]es can also eat chorus fruit and the teleportation effect works the same as with players.
