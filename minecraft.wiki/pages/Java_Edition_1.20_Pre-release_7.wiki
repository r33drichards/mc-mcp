'''1.20 Pre-release 7''' (known as '''1.20-pre7''' in the launcher) is the seventh and final pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.20]], released on May 29, 2023,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-20-pre-release-7|Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 7|May 29, 2023}}</ref> which adds symbolic link validation, and fixes a bug.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added {{cd|bamboo_mosaic_slab}} to {{cd|#slabs}} block and item tags.
* Added {{cd|bamboo_mosaic_stairs}} to {{cd|#stairs}} block and item tags.

'''General'''
* To improve safety, the game now detects symbolic links used inside {{cd|world}} directory.
** If the target of a symbolic link is not on the user-configured allow-list, the game does not proceed with loading the world.
*** Note: world directory itself can still be linked.
** The list of allowed symbolic link targets is stored in file {{cd|allowed_symlinks.txt}} in client or server top directory.
** The file consists of entries (one per line) with following formats allowed:
*** Lines starting with {{cd|#}} are comments and are ignored.
*** {{cd|[type]pattern}}, where type can be {{cd|glob}}, {{cd|regex}} or {{cd|prefix}}.
**** {{cd|prefix}} matches start of path with given pattern (so for {{cd|/test}} paths {{cd|d=and|/test|/test/|/test/foo.txt}} would match).
**** {{cd|regex}} matches regular expression against whole path.
**** {{cd|glob}} uses OS-specific path matching mechanism (for example {{cd|*.txt}} would usually match files with {{cd|txt}} extension).
**** Note: paths use OS-specific separators.
*** {{cd|pattern}}, which uses default {{cd|prefix}} type.
