A '''helmet''' (the leather variety being known as a '''cap''' and the type crafted from [[turtle scute]]s being known as a '''turtle shell''') is a piece of [[armor]] that covers the head of the player. There are seven primary tiers of helmet: '''leather''', '''golden''', '''copper''',  '''iron''', '''chainmail''', '''diamond''', and '''netherite'''. A '''[[turtle shell]]''' is another kind of helmet that gives the [[Water Breathing]] effect, and can be used to [[brewing|brew]] [[potions of the Turtle Master]].

=== Mob loot===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], and [[piglin]]s have a small chance to spawn wearing armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death, unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[vindicator]]s and [[pillager]]s spawned in [[raid]]s have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop an [[iron]] helmet. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and has a 50% chance of being [[enchanted]] with a random [[enchantment]].

== Usage ==
Helmets can be placed in the top armor slot of a player's [[inventory]] for activation.

=== Statistics ===
Each armor point reduces damage by 4% (increasing additively). Armor points are signified by half a shirt on the armor bar above the health bar. The effectiveness of armor points is decreased as the strength of incoming attacks increase, an effect lessened by armor toughness. Armor toughness does not have a visual indicator bar. Helmet durability is decreased by 1 for every {{hp|4}} of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Different helmet types have different enchantability from one another, a value that affects the strength of enchantments received directly though [[enchanting table]]s. Netherite helmets provide a knockback resistance of 1 (10%).

A helmet can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding units of the [[tiers]]' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two helmets of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A helmet can receive the following [[enchantment]]s. Note that while iron and chainmail have the same durability, chainmail has a higher [[enchantability]] than iron or diamond.

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a helmet, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
