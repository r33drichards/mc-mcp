On the eve of {{Wikipedia|All Hallow’s Eve}}, an adventurer named Rory returns to their home base for a rest, placing a path of [[note blocks]] along the road . Hanging up their [[elytra]], they feel fatigued and hungry for their favorite food, [[baked potatoes]]. While cooking it, they looked out a window and saw a flutter, afraid that it could be a ghost. Suddenly, the door flew open, terrifying Rory.

Going outside to investigate, Rory realized it was just their pet [[cat]] Silky, who sat on a [[pressure plate]] connected to the front [[door]]. Relieved, they went back to their [[furnace]] and gobbled a few potatoes up. Feeling stuffed, they stashed a few away in a nearby [[chest]], but realized there was already a pile right next to it. They excused this as forgetting they cooked another batch, but then realize there's a third pile on the [[crafting table]]. Now convinced there's an intruder, Rory pulls out a [[diamond sword]] and rushes outside, over to a chortle. They become shocked to discover there's a trail of potatoes leading out of the house.

The spectre sets off a note block, frightening Rory, before escaping into the [[Birch|canopy]]. Going back to grab their elytra, Rory chased after it. However, it quickly breaks from lack of care, and they fall into the [[Sand|bank]] of a lake. Rory hears the chortle again, and discovers none other than a [[chicken jockey]]. Running for their life, the three go in circles around the lake, before Rory discovered a [[boat]]. Gobbling down another potato, they leap into the boat, just as the sun began to rise. The jockey swam after, and quickly got into the boat, beating Rory to a pulp.

With the last of their energy, Rory manages to leap out of the boat and onto the shore, as the jockey burns in the sunlight. However, they remain injured and fatigued. Worse than that, they hear the chortle again. However, they finally realize that the ghost was an [[allay]] all along, clutching a baked potato. They drop the spud by Rory, and it all clicks; the allay had found potatoes lost on the prior adventure and was trying to return them. Satisfied with that explanation, they return home and are greeted by Silky, and are inspired to immortalize the experience by [[Item Frame|framing]] a potato.<ref name=":potato">{{mcnet|minecraft-mash-up--the-haunted-baked-potato|Minecraft Mash-Up: The Haunted Baked Potato|October 31, 2025|Sofia Dankis|archive-url|archive-time|url-prefix}}</ref>

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Welcome to our first ever Minecraft Mash-Up! Each month, we’ll be taking three things from Minecraft and splicing them into a story you can tell by a camp fire, read in bed, or scroll through distractedly while waiting for a train. Can you guess which three things we’ve woven into this tall tale? You get extra points if you know which updates or drops they’re from, too!|Sofia Dankis' introduction to the first installment<ref name=":potato" />|image=SofiaDankis mojavatar.png}}

== Trivia ==

* The appearance of an allay in a [[birch forest]] is a reference to the 2021 [[Mob Vote]], where they were associated with the biome.
