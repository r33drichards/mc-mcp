== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Whether you live in Minecraft like I door whether you are a person living on Earth, there's something we all share: a love of good food!

Who am I? You may call me the Gourmand. Why the Gourmand? I think of myself as something of a foodie, because I like to try out new foods I find during my adventures. I've traveled all over the place you know as Minecraft, going everywhere from the planes with [[bee nest|bee's nests]] and [[chickens]] to deep into the jungles with [[melons]] and [[cocoa]] to high up in the mountains with [[rabbit]]s. The garden at my home gives me all sorts of fruits and vegetables. I've been a happy eater.

But then I learned about this place called Earth! Not only does Earth have all sorts of things to offer (even if it's missing important things like [[mooshroom]]s), but it also has many more foods than I could have ever dreamed up. There I was, happily drinking my milk, having no idea you could ever use it to make yogurt, chocolate ice milk, cheese, and more. I was cheerfully chomping down on carrots with little pieces spraying everywhere, not realizing I could make a carrot salad.

While adventuring around Earth looking for recipes, I also learned that you can't generate here like you can in Minecraft. As I've observed Earth, I've come to realize that its beautiful environments are more fragile than they might seem, so taking good care of the world is important. This book includes tips on sustainability, which is all about not harming the world, so we can all enjoy its bounties for years to come. You can get your friends and family involved and protect your world!

But focusing on sustainability doesn't mean we can't have fun or eat wonderful foods! You know, just thinking about all these recipes is making me feel hungry. You can make every recipe with your family, snack on them while playing Minecraft, or prepare them for a birthday party. Come on, let's go exploring through these Minecraft-inspired recipes together! Bon appétit!|Introduction, 7}}
