A '''mirror''' is a vanity object used to show someone's reflection, owned by [[CommuniKate]].

== Appearance ==
Mirrors, or at least the one owned by CommuniKate, are shown to be a primarily purple circle with a pink rim and handle. The glass of the mirror appears slightly concave, and sometimes does not give off an actual reflection. On the back is a flower pattern.

== Properties ==
By staring into the glass of the mirror, the user can see any possible reflection. This can prove either narcissistic or greatly overwhelming depending on who is staring into it.

== Biography ==
After being ousted from her own show by [[Poseidon]], CommuniKate entered a faux depression, struggling to cope with her newfound lack of power. [[Quinn]] attempted to tell her to look on the bright side and see the situation as turning over a new leaf, but this only made Kate indulge further into herself. Pulling out a mirror, she started looking at herself.

Later, the team's mission of the day had turned south, almost being captured and petrified by [[Medusa]]. Kate proved to be woefully incompetent and ran off out of cowardice, apparently deciding to vent her frustrations by filming a confession cam segment. While doing this, she got reminded of her mirror from earlier in the episode, and used it to defeat Medusa.
