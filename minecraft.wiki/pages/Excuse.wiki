{{Q|“Excuse” was originally intended to be a song for Minecraft’s hell world, the “Nether”. However when I started creating this album, I wanted it to be more than just carbon copies of what’s in the game. I wanted to give people more. So I ultimately decided that “Excuse” would be one of several exclusive songs only to be found on this record.|C418|c418.org}}

'''"Excuse"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]''.

== Track description ==
"Excuse" is a sparse, somewhat eerie track that consists of a piano playing a sad piece with slightly discordant chords that echo as if in a cave (sometimes with a [[wikipedia:Vibrato|vibrato]] effect applied).

== Trivia ==
* "Excuse" was originally supposed to play in [[The Nether|the Nether]], but then C418 decided when he started creating the album that he wanted the album to be "more than just carbon copies of what’s in the game".
