A '''stone shovel''' is a variant of [[shovel]] that is crafted from [[cobblestone]]. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the fifth-highest [[tier]] of shovel, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack damage, and durability than a [[wooden shovel]].

A stone shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[cobblestone]], [[cobbled deepslate]], or [[blackstone]], with each block restoring 25% of the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two stone shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A stone shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
