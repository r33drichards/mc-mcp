'''14w26b''' is the thirtieth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on June 25, 2014,<ref name=blog>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624075744/https://mojang.com/2014/06/minecraft-snapshot-14w26a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w26c|date=June 25, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> to fix a major bug pertaining to the lack of chunk rendering in multiplayer introduced in [[14w26a]].

It was strongly advised to make a backup of a world before using this snapshot, because of block-corrupting problems that were not corrected until [[14w26c]].<ref name="mojang"/>
A potential means of recovering corrupted worlds using [[Programs and editors/Mapping#Map Editors|MCEdit]] is available.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/29551r/if_you_corrupted_a_large_project_or_lost_a_large/</ref>
