A '''mangrove''' is a [[tree]] with large canopies and aerial root systems found in [[mangrove swamp]]s. They can grow in [[water]] or on land, and their [[wood]] color is vermillion. They can be planted in the air, but their roots always touch the ground.

== Appearance ==
Mangroves consist of four large [[moss carpet]]-covered roots supporting a central trunk. From a large canopy hangs [[vines]] and [[mangrove propagule]]s.

== Generation ==
[[File:BeeNestMangrove.png|thumb|Bee nest on a mangrove]]
[[File:Trial Chambers display 2.png|thumb|A mangrove as it appears in trial chambers.]]
Mangroves generate naturally in the [[mangrove swamp]] biome.

They also have a {{frac|2|9}} (22.2%) chance to generate in "[[Trial Chambers/Structure#Entrances|display 2]]" inside [[trial chambers]] entrances.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from mangrove:
*{{BlockLink|Mangrove Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
*{{BlockLink|Mangrove Log}} (harvested with any [[tool]] including hands)
*{{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
*{{BlockLink|Mangrove Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
*{{BlockLink|Stripped Mangrove Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
*{{BlockLink|Mangrove Propagule}} (if fully grown, drops when it is broken)
*{{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
*{{BlockLink|Mangrove Roots}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
*{{BlockLink|Vines}} (harvested with shears)
*{{BlockLink|Moss Carpet}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
*{{BlockLink|Bee Nest}} (1% chance of generating)

== Planting ==

[[Mangrove propagule]]s can be planted and grown on all of these blocks, even if submerged underwater:
*{{BlockLink|Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Podzol}}
*{{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
*{{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Farmland}}
*{{BlockLink|Mud}}
*{{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
*{{BlockLink|Clay}}

When mangrove trees grow, they convert any [[mud]] in the way of the [[mangrove roots]] to [[muddy mangrove roots]]. They require a minimum clear space of 5×5 to grow. However, they can grow in smaller spaces, like a 1×1 area, as long as the walls don't exceed 10 blocks in height from the block where the sapling is planted. In such cases, the tree grows on top of the confined space. The smallest box in which a tree can be planted is 5×5×5, and the tree's maximum size blueprint occupies a 13×13×18 volume. They require a block (excluding [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[mangrove roots]], [[vines]], [[leaves]], and [[moss carpet]]) to be in all four directions; within a 1×15×5 area for the north and south and 5×15×1 in the east and west vertically centered on the block the [[mangrove propagule]] is planted on; for each column only the highest block (excluding [[mud]] and [[water]]) in the area is checked. Not every combination of locations is valid, the roots have specific patterns of columns they check. The roots grow to these blocks.

Based on 1000+ iterations of using a command block to replace the central mangrove tree trunk with air, and the propagule on the ground, along with using a high random tick speed rate, the maximum dimensions the of a mangrove tree is 27 blocks tall, 17×17 wide, consisting of leaves that are 5 pillars of 5×5 leaves arranged in a cross pattern, with tapering on the bottom and hollowing on the top. The center is the lowest, north and south are a block taller, and east and west are yet another block taller. The branches can spread as far as 5 blocks from the center trunk, and as high as 25 blocks from the ground. The roots appear to form pyramids to hold the outward and upward spread of logs.[[File:Maximum Mangrove Tree.png|thumb|The maximum mangrove tree appearance.]][[File:Maximum Mangrove Tree skeleton.png|thumb|The underlying skeleton of the maximum mangrove tree.]]

Vines can appear anywhere on the tree. Propagules can appear anywhere on the tree provided that there is space underneath a leaf block.

When a mangrove grows from a propagule, it has a 1% chance of generating a [[bee nest]] containing 2-3 bees. Unlike other tree types, this does not require the propagule to be placed next to flowers.<ref>{{bug|MC-249937||Propagules grown without a flower nearby can generate bee nests in the mangrove tree|WAI}}</ref>
