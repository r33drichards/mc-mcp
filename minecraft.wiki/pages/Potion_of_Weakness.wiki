=== Thrown projectile ===
A [[witch]] has a 25% chance of throwing a [[splash potion]] of [[Weakness]] if a player is 3 or less blocks away and does not already have the Weakness effect. Also, the player's [[health]] has to be at {{hp|8}} or less, or the player has to have the [[Poison]] effect.

The [[thrown]] potion cannot be picked up, but it can cause the [[Weakness]] effect.

=== Generated loot ===
One [[splash potion]] of Weakness can be found in the [[brewing stand]] inside every [[igloo]] basement.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, the [[cauldron]] in a [[swamp hut]] contains 1 to 2 bottles of a random potion. There is a 10% for it to be a potion of Weakness.
