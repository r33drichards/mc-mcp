== Biography ==
Before the series began, River was shown to be a mesa farmer in-between interview clips.

River was once teleported from her home along with the others by [[CommuniKate]] using a [[command block]] on the show. She and [[Durango]] won the first and sixth challenges, and in the final challenge, she and the others sabotaged their way back home, but were teleported to the [[Greek Isles]]. Poseidon teleported River to a sand pillar in the Kraken Sea along with the other heroes, and she spent most of the season there. Then at the end, all the heroes escape and try to stop Poseidon. After a while, Zeus comes, stops Poseidon, and asks heroes to help him. After helping the god, River and Durango apparently returned home.
