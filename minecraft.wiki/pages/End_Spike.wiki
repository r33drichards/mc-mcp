'''End spikes'''<ref><code>end_spike</code> – in-game structure ID {{in|Java}}.</ref> (also known as '''obsidian spikes''', '''obsidian pillars''', '''obsidian towers''', and '''End pillars''') are a [[feature]] in [[the End]] that are made of [[obsidian]]. There are ten End spikes per world, all generating on the central End island.

== Generation ==
End spikes generate naturally the first time the [[player]] enters [[the End]], and regenerate when the [[ender dragon]] is respawned.

When the ender dragon respawns, any blocks the player had placed within 10 blocks in all directions of the bedrock block at the top of the End spikes are deleted, as well as blocks inside the square containing the edge of the pillar down to Y=66.

== Construction ==
{{main|/Structure}}
End spikes are composed of [[obsidian]], with a single [[bedrock]] block, a [[fire]] block, and an [[End crystal]] on top of each pillar. They have cylindrical forms.

The following 10 pillars generate in a 43-block radius circle around the exit portal in a random order (total of 40499 obsidian):

* A 3-block radius pillar ending at Y=76 (total of 1596 blocks of obsidian);
* A 3-block radius pillar with iron bars ending at Y=79 (total of 1659 blocks of obsidian);
* A 3-block radius pillar with iron bars ending at Y=82 (total of 1722 blocks of obsidian);
* A 4-block radius pillar ending at Y=85 (total of 3145 blocks of obsidian);
* A 4-block radius pillar ending at Y=88 (total of 3256 blocks of obsidian);
* A 4-block radius pillar ending at Y=91 (total of 3367 blocks of obsidian);
* A 5-block radius pillar ending at Y=94 (total of 5358 blocks of obsidian);
* A 5-block radius pillar ending at Y=97 (total of 5529 blocks of obsidian);
* A 5-block radius pillar ending at Y=100 (total of 5700 blocks of obsidian);
* A 6-block radius pillar ending at Y=103 (total of 9167 blocks of obsidian).

The bottom of all pillars are at Y level 0, which means that pillars are generated through the island. If the End biome is used in the [[Overworld]], End spikes generate all the way down to Y=-64, replacing all other blocks, including bedrock. The second and third shortest pillars include a cage comprised of 73 [[iron bars]] surrounding the End crystal, to protect it from projectiles.

The pillars are generated in the following coordinates (center of the pillar) regardless of the seed:

* At x: -42, z: -1;
* At x: -34, z: -25;
* At x: -34, z: 24;
* At x: -13, z: -40;
* At x: -13, z: 39;
* At x: 12, z: -40;
* At x: 12, z: 39;
* At x: 33, z: -25;
* At x: 33, z: 24;
* At x: 42, z: 0.
