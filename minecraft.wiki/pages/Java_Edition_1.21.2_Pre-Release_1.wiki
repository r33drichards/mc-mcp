'''1.21.2 Pre-Release 1''' (known as '''1.21.2-pre1''' in the [[launcher]]) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.21.2]], released on October 8, 2024,<ref name="mcnet">{{cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-2-pre-release-1|title=Minecraft 1.21.2 Pre-Release 1|date=October 8, 2024|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref> which fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added the <code>disablePlayerMovementCheck</code> game rule.
** Controls the player movement speed restriction.
** This behaves the same as the <code>disableElytraMovementCheck</code> rule, but applies irrespective of flying with elytra.
** Default to <code>false</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Damage#Drowning|Oxygen]] bar'''
* Added an empty state for air bubbles ([[File:Empty Bubble (icon).png|class=pixel-image|18px]]) along with a wobble when the player is drowning.
* Added a popping sound for when bubbles pop on the oxygen bar, increasing in pitch depending on the oxygen left.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>57</code>.

'''[[Data component format|Item components]]'''
* <code>minecraft:equippable</code>
** Added field <code>camera_overlay</code> (optional): namespaced ID of the overlay texture to use when equipped.
*** If not specified, no overlay is used.
*** The ID addresses a texture under the textures/ folder and automatically assumed to be .png.
**** For instance, {{samp|misc/pumpkinblur}} addresses {{samp|textures/misc/pumpkinblur.png}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>41</code>.
* Added texture and sound for tweaked air bubble UI.
** New texture added for empty air bubble.
** Sound added for when air bubble pops.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* The format of color fields in particle options is now more standardized:
** RGB fields can always be encoded either as a vector of floats (order: <code>[R,G,B]</code>) or as a single packed integer (order: <code>RGB</code>).
** ARGB fields can always be encoded either as a vector of floats (order: <code>[R,G,B,A]</code> or as a single packed integer (order: <code>ARGB</code>).
** Changed fields:
*** <code>minecraft:trail.color</code> (previously accepted only integer).
*** <code>minecraft:dust.color</code> (previously accepted only vector of floats).
*** <code>minecraft:dust_color_transition.from_color</code> (previously accepted only vector of floats).
*** <code>minecraft:dust_color_transition.to_color</code> (previously accepted only vector of floats).

'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* [[Carpet]]s and [[wolf armor]] now show the enchantment glint on [[llama]]s and [[wolves]].

== Experimental ==
The listed changes are only present when the "Winter Drop" [[experimental]] data pack is enabled.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Creaking heart]]'''
* A [[comparator]] that is attached to the creaking heart block outputs a signal strength dependent on the distance to the connected creaking.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[Creaking]]'''
* Doesn't activate or freeze around players in [[Creative]] mode.
* Cannot be named with a [[name tag]] if summoned via a creaking heart.

==== General ====
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>pale_garden</code> to the <code>#is_overworld</code> biome tag.
