'''Netherite''' is a [[metal]] alloy from [[the Nether]], used primarily to [[Smithing#Upgrading|upgrade]] [[diamond]] gear. Netherite items are more powerful and durable than diamond, and in dropped item form are resistant to fire or lava. Netherite blocks are also unbreakable by the strongest explosions from normal gameplay, with the exception of [[Wither#Wither Skull|blue wither skulls]].

== Lore ==
* According to lore, pure netherite ore no longer exists naturally because piglins have mined it all out, leaving behind only [[Ancient Debris|ancient debris]].<ref>{{Mcnet|the-nether-update-here|The Nether Update is here|June 23, 2020|[[Per Landin]]}}</ref>

== Blocks and items == 
Many blocks and items make netherite, are made with netherite, are used to upgrade gear to netherite, or are directly stated to be netherite. They are:
* {{BlockLink|Ancient Debris}} - the blast-resistant ore form rarely found at low altitudes in the Nether, or as loot in [[bastion remnant]]s (which may also contain netherite scraps and ingots).
* {{BlockLink|Block of Netherite}} - the mineral block form of netherite ingots.
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Scrap}} - an item obtained by smelting ancient debris, used to craft [[netherite ingot]]s.
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Ingot}} - used for [[crafting]] and [[Smithing#Upgrading|upgrading]] diamond gear to netherite.
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Upgrade}} - a [[smithing template]], found as loot in bastion remnants, used for [[Smithing#Upgrading|upgrading]] diamond gear to netherite.

== Gear and tools ==
Netherite gear is made by [[Smithing#Upgrading|upgrading]] [[Diamond family|diamond]] gear at a [[smithing table]] using a '''netherite ingot''' and a [[netherite upgrade]]. These are:
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Axe}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Hoe}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Pickaxe}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Sword}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Spear}} 
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Helmet}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Chestplate}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Leggings}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Boots}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Horse Armor}}
* {{ItemLink|Netherite Nautilus Armor}}

== Gameplay ==
* Netherite [[tier]]
* Netherite [[armor material]]

== April Fools' ==
Blocks that appeared only in [[April Fools' Day jokes|April Fools' Day joke]] versions containing netherite textures, but not necessarily made of netherite. They are:
* {{BlockLink|Swaggiest stairs ever}} - an April Fools' Day joke version of stairs for the netherite block, available only in snapshot [[20w14∞]].
