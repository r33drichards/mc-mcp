An '''ender pearl''' is an [[item]] that can be [[Projectile|thrown]] to [[Teleportation|teleport]] to where it lands, or used to craft [[eyes of ender]], which are required to access [[the End]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
{{Drop sources|Ender Pearl}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|ender-pearl}}

A [[trapped chest]] always containing 2 ender pearls can be found in the "fake end portal" room of [[woodland mansion]]s.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s have a {{frac|10|469}} (~2.13%) chance to [[barter]] 2–4 ender pearls when given a [[gold ingot]].

== Usage ==
Ender pearls can be thrown by pressing {{control|use}}. After it is thrown, the ender pearl is consumed, and the player teleports to where it lands, taking {{hp|5}} [[fall damage]]. This will work even if the ender pearl lands in another [[dimension]]{{verify|Verify for Bedrock Edition}}. Wearing armor enchanted with [[Protection]] and/or [[Feather Falling]] reduces the damage taken from the ender pearl. If a player dies from fall damage due to throwing an ender pearl, the [[death message]] says "<player> hit the ground too hard".

However, if the player throws an ender pearl before hitting the ground, the fall damage is negated, dealing only the pearl’s damage.

Ender pearls have a cooldown of one second before they can be used again. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay on the ender pearl that shrinks and must disappear before the player can use it again. If there are other inventory or hotbar slots containing ender pearls, they are covered with the white overlay as well.<ref>{{bug|MC-88236|||WAI}}</ref>

If the player throws an ender pearl and then dies while the pearl is in a loaded chunk before impact, the pearl disappears and the player is not teleported; {{in|java}}, the pearl does not vanish upon the player's death if the [[game rule]] {{cd|enderPearlsVanishOnDeath}} is set to {{cd|false}}.

Ender pearls that fall into the [[void]] disappear, and do not trigger the player to teleport. Ender pearl entities are invincible and therefore are not destroyed by [[lava]], and can teleport the player to the bottom of lava pools/lava oceans.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Spawning endermites ===
An ender pearl has a 5% chance to spawn an [[endermite]] when it lands. This is the only way through which endermites can spawn, without using cheats. The endermite spawns at ''the player's position'' when the pearl lands{{only|je}}, or at the pearl's landing site{{only|be}}.

=== Stasis chamber ===
Ender pearls are affected by [[bubble column]]s. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely{{only|je}}. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a [[trapdoor]]), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are. {{IN|be}}, [[honey block]]s can be used to make the ender pearl go straight down, creating a statis chamber.{{info needed|Elaborate. The current statement isn't very coherent and doesn't explain the specific setup.}}

=== Chunk loading ===
{{Main|Chunk#Chunk loading}}
{{exclusive|java|section=yes}}
An ender pearl creates a ticket for chunk loading every time it moves (due to its own tick) into a new [[chunk]], and also periodically almost every 2 seconds (39 ticks). It loads and ticks the chunk it is in with a ticket level of 31 as entity processing. It also loads a two-chunk wide ring (a 5×5 chunk area centered on the pearl's chunk) around it as lazy chunks, the first ring being block ticking and the second ring being border chunks. The ender pearl continues to load chunks as long as the player who threw it is online, even when that player is in a different dimension. The pearl stops loading chunks when the player logs off, and starts loading chunks again when the player logs in.

== Behavior ==
<section begin="thrownball"/><!-- For transclusion; do not remove or tamper -->
{{Infobox entity
| title = {{PAGENAME}} (entity)
| size = Height: 0.25 blocks<br>Width: 0.25 blocks
| tickingorder = adp
| gravity = 0.03
| drag = 0.99
| drag_float = true
}}

=== Motion ===
{{Main|Entity#Motion|Projectile#Initial conditions}}
<includeonly>==== Thrown by player ====</includeonly><!--
Include for transclusion only
-->
When thrown straight up, {{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}s travel 27.68993 blocks{{Only|java}} / about 45 blocks{{Only|bedrock}} (plus randomness). They travel up to ~51.5 blocks forward when thrown at an optimum launch angle of ~40° (on even ground).

Since the thrower's velocity influences the throw, timing a throw with a jump towards the target can increase the throwing range. It increases to about 42 blocks when thrown straight up and 64 blocks forward at a 35° angle{{Verify}}. For the same reason, throwing while falling significantly decreases the range.

Thrown {{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}s experience initial speed of about 1.5 block/tick. Their movement follows the ticking order of acceleration, drag, position and this can be simulated to predict the overall trajectory. Below is a calculator to predict the initial conditions in order to hit a desired coordinate:

{{:Calculators/Projectile motion|name=thrown {{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}|type=6|gravity=-0.03|dragx=0.99|dragy=0.99|speed=1.5|hideproperties=1|x0=0|y0=1.62|z0=0|xt=51|yt=0|zt=0|hidedynamics=1}}<!--
-->
<includeonly>==== Shot by dispenser ====
{{ucfirst:{{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}}}s shot by dispensers behave in the exact manner as when they were thrown by a player, with the only difference in their initial conditions. The initial position of {{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}s when shot by a dispenser offsets exactly 0.7 blocks forward and 0.1 blocks higher from the center of the block. Their initial speed is slightly randomized, which averages to about 1.1 block/tick.</includeonly><!--
Include for transclusion only
-->

=== Collisions ===
{{Main|Projectile#Collisions}}

Thrown {{lc:{{PAGENAME}}}}s collide with blocks according to their collision box. They also collide with entities, but with the entities' collision box inflated to about 0.3 blocks in every direction. They collide with all living entities, including minecarts, boats, end crystals, falling blocks, and TNT.<section end="thrownball"/><!-- For transclusion; do not remove or tamper -->

Thrown ender pearls use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Ender pearls can be used to teleport/move through non-[[solid block]]s without suffocation and solid blocks by pressing against the blocks and using the ender pearl at the [[player]]'s feet until the player goes through.<ref>{{bug|MC-2164}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|KA1UmxraeUg}}</ref>
* In ''[[Java Edition]]'', it is possible to spawn a thrown ender pearl using commands, but it does not teleport, unless it is assigned an owner.
* If the player throws an ender pearl in Survival mode and changes to Creative mode before the pearl lands, the player is still teleported.
* The player is still teleported by throwing an ender pearl and entering [[the Nether]] before it lands. The pearl is not lost if an ender pearl is thrown into a [[nether portal]] and the player travels through the portal; the pearl lands and teleports the player as usual.
* If multiple ender pearls are thrown in succession, the player can be hurt only once from fall damage within about a one-second span.
