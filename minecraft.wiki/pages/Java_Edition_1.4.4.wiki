'''1.4.4''' is a minor update to {{JE}} that was released on November 14, 2012, primarily to fix bugs from [[Java Edition 1.4.2|1.4.2]].<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-1-4-4-is-out/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-1-4-4-is-out/|title=Minecraft 1.4.4 is out!|author=Jens Bergensten|website=Mojang.com|date=November 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://mcupdate.tumblr.com/post/35704186352/minecraft-144|title=Minecraft 1.4.4|website=mcupdate.tumblr.com}}</ref>

A pre-release version of 1.4.4 was released on November 8, 2012,<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-1-4-4-pre-release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-1-4-4-pre-release|title=Minecraft 1.4.4 Pre-release|author=Jens Bergensten|website=Mojang.com|date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> though the full release of 1.4.4 is identical to this pre-release.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Music Disc Wait JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Music disc]]'''
* Implemented the music disc "wait".
** This music disc was originally added to the game's files in [[Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2]] named "where are we now", but could not be implemented due to issues with the spaces in its name, so it has been renamed to "wait".

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|enchant}}'''
* Used to give specific [[enchantments]] to tools and weapons.<ref group=note name=release>This change occurred between the [[Java Edition 1.4.3|1.4.3 pre-release]] and the full release of 1.4.4.</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|B}} now shows the [[hitbox]] around [[entities]].
** At this point, the hitbox is white and opaque and does not have an outline.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Cobweb JE2.png|32px]] [[Cobweb]]s'''
* When in [[creative]] mode, flying through cobwebs does not slow the [[player]] down, but walking through them will.<ref name=release group=note />

'''{{Animate|Cobblestone Wall (EWU) JE1.png;Mossy Cobblestone Wall (EWU) JE1.png|32px}} [[Wall]]s'''
* Now have a bigger hitbox; previously they shared the [[fence]] hitbox.<ref>{{bug|MC-1332}}</ref>

'''[[File:Water JE11.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Water now completely negates all fall damage.<ref>{{bug|MC-1644||Players and mobs do not die from great heights in shallow water|Works as Intended}}</ref>

=== Mobs ===
'''Baby [[mobs]]'''
* Spawnable by right-clicking a mob with a corresponding [[spawn egg]].<ref name=release group=note />

'''[[File:Creeper JE3 BE1.png|32px]] [[Creeper]]s'''
* Can now drop [[music disc]] "11" when killed by a [[skeleton]].

'''[[File:Squid JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Squid]]'''
* Now die when they are not underwater.<ref name=release group=note />

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* [[Wall]] block [[Hitbox|collision box]]es no longer lose precision at extreme coordinates.
** This is likely due to the fixing of {{bug|MC-1332}}.
