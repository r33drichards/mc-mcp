'''Lush caves''' are temperate cave [[biome]]s with unique fauna and flora and are found underground below humid biomes, indicated above ground by [[azalea tree]]s.

== Description ==
[[Azalea tree]]s generate on any empty space above a lush cave, with roots consisting of [[rooted dirt]] and [[hanging roots]] that generate down until reaching the lush cave. This is most common at the surface, but they can sometimes generate inside [[cave]]s if there is enough room. 

Underground, [[Moss Block|moss]] and [[ore]]s cover the floors and ceilings, along with [[moss carpet]]s, [[grass]], and [[azalea]] bushes on the floors. On the ceiling, [[vines]] and [[cave vines]] with [[glow berries]] grow down and light up the caves, and [[spore blossom]]s grow from the ceiling and drip water [[particle]]s. [[Dripleaf]] plants grow up from shallow lakes lined with [[clay]], which sometimes generate dry. Water can also generate here in the form of [[spring]]s. Asides from the regular underground [[structures]] that can generate in all biomes, [[woodland mansions]] rarely generate on the surface above lush caves {{In|be}}. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], lush caves biomes use a strong humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting similar to [[jungles]], which fades the distance in an orange tint. Lush caves have default atmospherics and lighting, and warmish color grading, which makes the biome look more humid and warm without strong effects at the surface. 

Players cannot [[World Spawn|spawn]] in a lush caves biome during [[world]] generation.

=== Generation ===
Lush caves generate underground at any [[altitude]]. They favor generating underneath biomes with high [[humidity]] values (H=3,4), which makes them most commonly found beneath [[dark forest]]s, [[jungle]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, [[wooded badlands]], and [[taiga]]s at temperatures of -0.450 and below, but may also generate under [[windswept forest]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[taiga]]s at temperatures of -0.150 to -0.450 and [[snowy taiga]]s. Dark forests, old growth taigas, [[bamboo jungle]]s, wooded badlands, and taigas at temperatures of -0.450 and below are almost ''guaranteed'' to have lush caves generate below them, but when these biomes generate far inland, [[dripstone caves]] may generate underneath them instead.

It is not possible for lush caves to generate beneath [[forest]]s and grassland biomes like [[plains]] and [[savanna]] as they are not humid enough.

Lush caves can sometimes generate beneath [[ocean]]s, [[desert]]s, and [[mushroom fields]], whose generation is independent of humidity values. They are also the only underground biome capable of generating beneath oceans and mushroom fields.

Forests, [[flower forest]]s, and [[cherry grove]]s are the only forested biomes where lush caves do not generate at all, and deserts are the only non-forested biomes where lush caves can generate.

== Mobs ==
[[Bat]]s, [[glow squid]], [[tropical fish]], and [[axolotl]]s are the only passive [[mob]]s that spawn, with the latter being exclusive to the biome. While hostile mobs can spawn throughout the biome, many areas have a light level greater than 0 due to the pervasive [[glow berries]]. Most hostile mobs are therefore found in large caverns more than 10 blocks high and near borders with other cave biomes.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
