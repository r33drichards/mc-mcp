'''18w02a''' is the thirteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on January 10, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w02a|January 10, 2018}}</ref>, which changed the {{cmd|teleport}} command.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the new block tag <code>minecraft:enderman_holdable</code>.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Added "Cave Sound 19".

== Changes ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Fishing bobber]]s'''
* Now have an entity ID, <code>fishing_bobber</code>.
** This ID can only be used for testing, summoning is not possible.

'''[[Llama spit]]'''
* Hitbox has been decreased from using the player's hitbox to be 0.25x0.25x0.25 blocks.

'''[[Painting]]s '''
* Now use a [[resource location]] for their motive.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|teleport}}'''
* Has been simplified:
** {{cmd|teleport <entity>}} does not allow rotation or facing, and teleports to the entity.
** {{cmd|teleport <x y z>}} does not allow rotation or facing, and teleports to the position.
** {{cmd|teleport <entity1> <entity2>}} does not allow rotation or facing, and teleports ''entity1'' to ''entity2''.
** {{cmd|teleport <entity> <x y z> [<yRot> <xRot>]}} teleports ''<entity>'' to that position with optional rotation.
** {{cmd|teleport <entity> <x y z> facing [<xFacing> <yFacing> <zFacing>]}} teleports ''<entity>'' to that position facing another position.
** {{cmd|teleport <entity1> <x y z> facing entity <entityFacing> [feet{{!}}eyes]}} teleports ''entity1'' to that position facing ''entityFacing''&#8202;'s feet or eyes (defaults to feet).
** Teleporting to an entity in another dimension is now allowed.

'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* Added new sub-commands to {{cmd|execute}} to allow for more control over commands.
** <code>facing <x y z></code> runs the command as though the executor is facing <code>x y z</code>.
** <code>facing entity <entity> (eyes{{!}}feet)</code> runs the command as though the executor is facing the entity's eyes or feet.
** <code>offset <x y z></code> has been renamed to <code>positioned x y z</code>.
** <code>positioned as <entity></code> changes the command position (x y z) but nothing else.
** <code>rotated as <entity></code> or <code>rotated y x</code> runs the command as though the executor is rotated in that direction.
** <code>in (overworld{{!}}the_end{{!}}the_nether)</code> runs the command as though it's in that dimension.
** <code>at <entity></code> changes the dimension, position and rotation of the command to match that entity.
** <code>(if{{!}}unless) score <name> <objective> matches <range></code> tests for a score in a range (ie <code>1</code>, <code>1..5</code>).
** <code>anchored (feet{{!}}eyes)</code> makes the rest of this command use feet or eyes for ^ ^ ^ coordinates or facing commands.
* Server commands ([[Commands/function|function]]s, console, rcon) now run from world spawn in the Overworld, instead of at <code>0,0,0</code>.

'''Error messages'''
* Errors during a command are now a nicer error message (with a tooltip for more info).

=== General ===
'''Translation files'''
* Changed from <code>.lang (key=value)</code> to <code>.json ("key": "value")</code>.
** Now supports newlines.
