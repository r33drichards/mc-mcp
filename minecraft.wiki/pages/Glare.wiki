The '''glare''' was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2021 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[Minecraft Live 2021]], alongside the [[allay]] and [[copper golem]].<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2021-glare|Mob Vote 2021 Glare|October 11, 2021|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

The glare would have flown to areas dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn in, and then would have become grumpy to alert the player of this.<ref>{{ytl|uYIQsr9vsws|Minecraft Live 2021: Vote for the glare!|Minecraft|October 11, 2021}}</ref> It may have helped light up these areas as well.<ref>{{ytl|w6zLprHHZOk|Minecraft Live 2021|Minecraft|October 16, 2021|t=3727}}</ref>

The glare lost the vote with only 11.2% of the votes; the allay won.
