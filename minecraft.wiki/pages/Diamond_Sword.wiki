A '''diamond sword''' is a variant of [[sword]] that is crafted from [[diamond]]s. It is the second-highest [[tier]] of sword, dealing more damage than an [[iron sword]] and having higher durability. It can be upgraded into a [[netherite sword]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

{{Trade sources|Enchanted Diamond Sword}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
{{main|Sword#Breaking}}
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.<ref>{{bug|MC-195168||Swords consume double durability than they normally would when destroying bamboo saplings, bamboo, or cobwebs}}</ref>

If a sword is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], either using [[Creative]] or [[commands]], cobwebs the sword destroys drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.

==== Creative mode ====
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as [[minecart]]s, [[painting]]s, [[item frame]]s,{{only|java}} and [[armor stand]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-27140}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-18463}}</ref>

=== Attacking ===
{{main|Sword#Attacking}}

A diamond sword is used to deal [[damage]] to mobs and entities by {{control|attacking}} them. The diamond sword has {{hp|7}} base damage {{in|je}} and {{hp|8}} base damage {{in|be}}, and can be enchanted to deal more damage. The following tables show how the [[Sharpness]] enchantment affects the damage dealt by the sword.

A diamond sword can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[diamond]]s, with each repair diamond restoring 25% the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond swords can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the diamond sword's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A diamond sword can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
