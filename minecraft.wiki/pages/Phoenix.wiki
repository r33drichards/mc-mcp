The '''phoenix''' is a mythological bird that is reborn after death featured in the [[Minecraft Mini-Series]].

== Appearance ==
The phoenix looks like a parrot, but is yellow and has a smaller beak. It has yellow eyeballs and red pupils, and has red spots around its eyes. He also has a bright yellow crest on its head, red neck and bright yellow tips of the wings and tail.

== Biography ==
The Phoenix appeared, when Poseidon teleported him with the command block to kill the heroes. Durango tried to kill the phoenix twice with a clever throw of the trident, but the phoenix took out its trident and continued to attack the heroes. The phoenix then fired several fireballs at the group of Greek women, and then flew on after the heroes. Durango was able to jump on the phoenix and ride it, but Poseidon then teleported him back.

== Power and Abilities ==
As shown in the series, the phoenix can fly fast, shoot fireballs and has superhuman strength, as well as immortality.
