'''Brick pyramids''' were tall experimental [[generated structure]]s made up exclusively of [[bricks]] present in [[Java Edition Infdev]].

== Generation ==
Brick pyramids would generate in predetermined locations throughout the world. These locations were always the same regardless of the world [[Seed (world generation)|seed]], surrounding terrain, or game version and only generate in the south-east quadrant (positive X, positive Z). For every 1024x1024 block area in the south-east quadrant, exactly one pyramid generates. This results in 976,562,500 pyramids generating in the world, before being overwritten by the [[world boundary]] (Prior to [[Java Edition Infdev 20100313|Inf-20100313]], this number was 1,073,741,824, only being cut off by the [[Java Edition Far Lands/Up to Infdev 20100325-1640|Far Lands]].)

== Structure ==
Brick pyramids were completely solid; they had no interior rooms. A strange quality about these pyramids is that they spawned right on top of the terrain instead of being a complete pyramid with the bottom underground (like with [[desert pyramid]]s); their bottom face would conform to the terrain rather than being flat. The pyramid would generate its top block at the top elevation of the map, and would expand down from there, with each consecutive layer containing the next odd square number of brick blocks. Since the height limit initially was 128<ref>[[Altitude#History]]</ref> and sea level and typical ground level was 64, the base of a pyramid was typically 127×127 blocks and the pyramid itself was 64 blocks high. Whenever it spawned on top of a large body of [[water]], it would usually add to the number of bases.

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java infdev}}
|{{HistoryLine||20100227-1414|Added brick pyramids.
|Brick pyramids have been added to test out structure generation.
|Brick pyramids generate too high, resulting in their top layers being truncated by the height limit, resulting in a "brick square frustum".
|The pyramid would also generate with a 1×1 vertical hole replacing its centermost blocks.}}
|{{HistoryLine||20100227-1433|Brick pyramids now generate lower down, allowing them to generate in a "square-bottomed pyramid" shape as intended
|As a side effect of the height change, brick pyramids no longer generate with a vertical hole in place of a tip.}}
|{{HistoryLine||20100325-1545|Reimplemented [[cave]]s, which can carve into brick pyramids.}}
|{{HistoryLine||20100327|Brick pyramids have been removed with the rewrite of world generation.}}
}}

== Issues ==
Brick pyramids were removed from the game in early development and as such any issues relating to them are not considered valid for reporting.

== Trivia ==
* A full brick pyramid contained about 344,000 brick blocks, which is equivalent to about 5,249 stacks of brick blocks, though the exact number varies depending on the terrain.
* During the time that brick pyramids existed, there was no way to craft [[bricks]] in the unmodified game, which lead to brick pyramids becoming the only method of naturally obtaining them.
* Beginning from the spawn point, one can be found by walking forward (south) 500 blocks then turning left (facing east), and continuing on for another 500 blocks. This brick pyramid is centered at X=502, Z=553.
