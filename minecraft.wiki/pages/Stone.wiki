'''Stone''' is a [[block]] found underground in the [[Overworld]] or on the surface of [[mountains]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Natural generation ===
Stone makes up the majority of the [[solid block]]s generated in the Overworld above Y=0. From Y=8 downwards, stone gradually transitions into [[deepslate]], until it is completely replaced by deepslate at and below Y=0.

When [[chunk]]s generate, stone can be found under 1-5 layers of [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], [[coarse dirt]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[sand]], [[sandstone]], [[red sand]], [[red sandstone]], or [[terracotta]], depending on the [[biome]]. <!--There is approximately 11,520 stone per chunk.-->

When the world is generating new chunks, some stone is replaced with [[Ore (feature)|ore feature]]s of other blocks. They may also be revealed on the side of small hills.

Stone also generates in [[igloo]] basements, some [[Overworld]] [[ruined portal]]s, and in [[trail ruins]].

Stone also makes up most of the blocks on the [[void start platform]], in [[Superflat]] worlds created with [[the Void]] preset.

Stone also generates inside [[trial chambers]] with [[cobweb]]s on top next to [[trial spawner]]s. They also indicate that the spawner is a [[spider]] or [[cave spider]] spawner.

Stone can also be made by [[lava]] flowing on top of [[water]] blocks (both flowing and source). The water is replaced by stone.

=== Breaking ===
Stone can be mined using a [[pickaxe]], in which case it drops [[cobblestone]]. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. If a stone is mined with a [[Silk Touch]] enchanted pickaxe, it drops itself.

=== Smelting ===
Stone can be smelted from cobblestone.
