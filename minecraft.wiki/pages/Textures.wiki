{{Wip}}
The standard '''textures''' in ''[[Minecraft]]'' determine how each pixel of [[block]]s, [[item]]s, [[entities]], [[particles]], [[weather]] effects and [[GUI|GUIs]] is colored. Color texture maps are 4-channel RGBA image files, where the RGB values directly color a pixel, and the alpha channel is used for transparency on some textures. {{IN|java}} vanilla textures are located in {{cd|assets\minecraft\textures}} in <samp>[[client.jar]]</samp> (located {{cd|.minecraft\versions\1.#.#}}), while {{in|bedrock|edu}} they are in <code>textures</code> in the [[Resource pack#Internal resource packs|internal resource packs]].

== Types ==
=== Blocks ===
{{main|List of block textures}}
The textures of the [[block]]s in ''Minecraft'' are usually done in 16×16 pixels. Some blocks have an animated texture like [[water]], [[lava]], [[portal]] blocks, [[fire]], [[prismarine]], [[sea lantern]], [[Sea Grass|sea grasses]], [[command block]] and [[magma block]]s as well as [[stonecutter]] which have an animated pattern on each side. The animated textures are presented with a series of 16×16, the play of which alternates in succession.

=== Items ===
{{main|List of item textures}}
Just like the blocks, usually the textures of the [[item]]s in ''Minecraft'' are also done in 16×16 pixels. Most of the item textures are static, except those for [[clock]] and [[compass]]. {{IN|java}}, these animated textures are many separated 16×16 images, while {{in|bedrock|edu}} they are presented with a series of 16×16.

[[Light block]] and the [[element]]s {{in|bedrock|edu}} are the only item textures done in 32×32 for officially released ''Minecraft'' versions.

=== Entities ===
{{main|List of entity textures}}
Similar to the [[skin]] images, the textures of [[entities]] usually integrate images applied to all parts of an entity into one single file. Their resolution is higher than 16×16 pixels, but typically their heights and widths are multiples of 16px.

[[Armor]] textures are rendered separately on top of entities. [[Armor Trims|Armor trims]] are separate textures rendered on top of armor textures.

=== Paintings ===
{{main|List of painting textures}}Paintings are entities with flat textures rendered on the front and a planks texture on the back, stored separately from entities.

=== Particles ===
{{main|List of particle textures}}Particles are textures directly rendered in-game in 2D, always facing the camera. Animated particles use multiple texture files for the animation, and some sources emit particles with different textures. Various particles have gray textures, colored depending on the situation or animation. Some particles use [[texture atlases]] {{In|be}}.

=== GUI and UI ===
{{main|Java Edition GUI textures|Bedrock Edition GUI and UI textures}}
Most objects and graphics in [[GUI|GUIs]], [[UI|UIs]], and [[Menu screen|menu screens]] are generated with multiple textures, sometimes from [[texture atlases]]. Textures from [[Ore UI]] menu screens cannot be modified with resource packs and are stored in <code>[[Content]]/data/gui/dist/hbui</code> instead.

=== Other ===
The following miscellaneous textures are used for multiple objects, or other objects:{{Verify|edition=java}}

* [[Missing textures and models|Missing texture]], rendered when no texture or an invalid texture is provided.
* [[Glint]] texture for both [[armor]] and [[items]].
* [[Carved Pumpkin|Pumpkin]] blur [[overlay]].
* [[Map icons.png|Map icons]], on a texture atlas, and some icons stored separately.
* [[Burning|Flame]] atlas applied on burning entities.
* [[Colormap|Colormaps]], to apply [[colors]] to certain biome-dependend blocks.
* Environmental textures, including the [[sun]], [[moon]], [[weather]] particles, [[clouds]], [[End sky]], [[End Portal (block)|End portal]] colors, and the full block [[breaking]] animation.
* [[Water]] caustics with [[Vibrant Visuals]].
