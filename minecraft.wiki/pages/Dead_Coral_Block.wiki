A '''dead coral block''' is a dead variant of a [[coral block]]. These blocks are always gray. There are five variants total: tube, brain, bubble, fire, and horn.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Dead coral blocks can be obtained with any type of [[pickaxe]]. They can also be obtained by mining the respective live variant of [[coral block]]s without Silk Touch.
{{breaking row|sprite=Dead Coral Blocks|Dead Coral Block|Pickaxe|Wood|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, dead coral blocks naturally generate in [[coral reef]] structures, which can be found in [[warm ocean]]s. {{IN|JE}}, dead coral blocks do not generate naturally.

=== Post-generation ===
If a live [[coral block]] is placed outside of water, it transforms into its respective dead coral block after a few seconds &mdash; a grayscale version of the coral block. A coral block still dies if the [[game rule]] <code>randomTickSpeed</code> is set to {{cd|0}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-129942|||Invalid}}</ref>

== Usage ==
Dead coral blocks can be used for building or as decoration blocks. Unlike live coral blocks, dead coral blocks cannot be used for farming [[sea pickle]]s. It is not possible to turn a dead coral block back into a live [[coral block]].

=== Note blocks ===
All types of dead coral blocks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
