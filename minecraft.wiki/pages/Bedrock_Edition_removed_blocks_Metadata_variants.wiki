== Blocks resulting from extreme data values ==
The majority of these blocks were likely never actually meant to exist in-game, and occurred only due to the game handling extreme metadata values as it would those in usually attainable ranges, resulting in strange blocks with traits arguably analogous to garbage data.

=== Seamless stone slabs ===

This slab variant existed in the game at one point.<ref name="FinallyFoundIt">https://youtu.be/djvCj4tZdNM</ref>

=== Six-sided blocks ===
''Bedrock Edition'' had a handful of versions of "pillar"-type blocks which used side textures on all six sides. These were effectively removed in an unknown version, forcing them to appear identical to normal such pillars, either by changing their models to that of the normal y-axis pillar or just directly changing them (which method was utilized is unknown).

=== Weird Piston ===

The "six-sided piston" block existed for a period of time in ''Bedrock Edition'', but with a much different appearance from the six-sided piston known from other editions.

=== Granite, polished granite and diorite bells ===

Upon their introduction to ''Bedrock Edition'', bells using the textures of granite, polished granite and diorite also existed. They could only be placed by commands.

It is extremely likely that these were the result of the bell being incompletely programmed. The bell can face four directions, and at this point there were four different types of bell (the stone bell alongside these three), which would correspond to the four orthogonal facing directions. Since at this point granite and diorite were stored as data value of stone, it seems reasonable to expect that these would result from drawing from that data value of the used stone texture. Attempting to place a bell with data value 4 or above would fail; there were as a result no polished diorite, andesite or polished andesite bells, as these would not have any facing directions to correspond to. These bells automatically convert to rotated standing bells if a world containing them is updated to beta 1.10.0.3 or later.

==== Bell stand ====<!-- not official name, nor is “Bell-less block”-->
There had been an unused [[bell]] which consists of the stand without a bell. This bell cannot be rung, but it will drop a normal bell when broken.

It was merged into the normal version of the block in an unknown update.

=== Locked smoker, blast furnace, lectern, and barrel ===
There were also several unused blocks which were in a locked state. These blocks cannot be opened or used by the player (their GUI does not show up, but the player hand can still perform an action).{{More information needed|What about hoppers?}}

It was merged into the normal version of the block in an unknown update.

=== Smokeless campfire ===
[[Campfires]] updated from beta 1.10.0 to 1.11.0 did not produce smoke particles because campfires in 1.10.0 had no functionality. Their difference in the code is not known.

It was merged into the normal version of the block in an unknown update.

=== Overgrown wheat ===

From Pocket Edition v0.4.0 Alpha - Pocket Edition v0.7.0 Alpha, wheat with invalid data values of 8-15 would result in a glitched texture. This could be done via the use of a hex editor.
