An '''observer''' is a [[block]] that emits a quick [[redstone]] pulse from its back whenever its "face" detects that the [[block]], [[fluid]], or [[air]] directly in front of it has changed.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
An observer requires a [[pickaxe]] to be mined. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

}}

== Usage ==
An observer is placed similarly to a [[piston]]. It observes the block that it is placed against. The texture of the detecting side is that of an observing face. As observers can detect the state of other observers, placing two adjacent observers, each watching the other, can make a fast and compact redstone clock. They send out a [[redstone pulse]].

=== Behavior ===
{{IN|java}}, an observer detects [[Block update#Post placement update|shape updates]] coming from the block it's facing. This can involve changes in block states (like crops growing, for example), or the breaking or placing of a block. This makes observers differ from block update detectors in terms of what they can detect.{{only|JE|short=1}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, an observer acts as a block update detector and detects anything that causes a block update.

The causes and propagation of block updates are different between ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition''. As a result, each can detect some kinds of changes that the other cannot. See the table below for a comparison.

When it detects something, the observer emits a [[redstone pulse]] of [[Redstone circuit#Power|strong power]] at signal strength 15 for 2 [[game tick]]s. The pulse can power [[redstone dust]], a [[redstone comparator]], a [[redstone repeater]], or any [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism component]] located at its opposite end.

In ''Java Edition'', the pulse is emitted with a delay of 2 game ticks. In ''Bedrock Edition'', it is delayed by 2 game ticks as well, but it's sometimes delayed by 4 or 6 game ticks due to {{bug|MCPE-15793}}, a bug causing redstone delays to be incorrect when components are activated by world changes (which, in the case of the observer in ''Bedrock Edition'', is the only way it can be activated), as opposed to pure redstone components ticking. Its timing can also be incorrect due to {{bug|MCPE-73342}}.

Observers also emit a pulse after getting moved by [[pistons]]: this enables them to be used in [[flying machines]]. {{IN|JE}}, however, moving an observer that is currently emitting a redstone signal will cause it to turn off instead.

Because observers in ''Java Edition'' react to shape updates, they can detect some changes that a [[block update detector]] (BUD) would be unresponsive to, as opposed to ''Bedrock Edition'' where observers detect the exact same updates that any other BUD would detect.

[[File:Observer conduction behaviour.png|alt=An observer preventing the redstone signal from being transmitted.|thumb|200px|Observers preventing the redstone signal from being transmitted in ''Java Edition'']]
Observers are visually opaque and non-[[conductive]]: they block light and allow mob spawning on top, do not cut off redstone wire, and cannot conduct redstone power. {{IN|java}}, they also allow opening chests below and prevent redstone wire placed on it from transmitting a signal downward.

* [[Cactus]] breaking either by placing a [[solid block]] next to it, or by placing a [[fluid]] on top of it<ref>While it's not possible to set this up normally (since the observer has to place on the side of the cactus (because the top and the bottom are already occupied by the [[fluid]] and the block that supports the cactus (like sand) relatively), which causes the cactus to break), it's possible to reproduce this using the {{cmd|/fill ~ ~ ~ cactus strict}} command.{{verify}}</ref>

|{{HistoryLine||1.11|dev=16w39a|[[File:Observer JE1.png|32px]] Added observers. 
|Note: the "arrow" texture on the top/bottom of observers is pointing the wrong direction (toward the input, rather than the output).
|Observers act as a [[block update detector]].
|Observers emit pulses that last 2 [[game tick]]s and have a signal strength of 1.
|Observers can strongly power [[block]]s (like a [[redstone repeater]]).
|Observers have no delay between detecting a block update and emitting a pulse, meaning they are instant.
|Observers are placed with the observing, or input, side facing the [[player]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=16w41a|Observers now emit 4 [[game tick]] pulses.<ref>{{bug|MC-107410}}</ref>
|The signal strength of observers has now been changed to 15.<ref>{{bug|MC-107783}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-17439}}</ref>
|Observers ''appear'' to no longer strongly power [[block]]s and to emit weak power instead, like a [[block of redstone]] (and this may be the intended behavior for this snapshot). In reality they still emit strong power, but now they only update the block in front of their output side and nothing else, causing buggy behavior.<ref>{{bug|MC-108696}}</ref>
|Observers are now placed with the output facing the player.<ref>{{bug|MC-107934}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-17321}}</ref>
|A bug where observers would redirect [[redstone dust]] from all 4 directions has now been fixed.<ref>{{bug|MC-107795}}</ref> (They are supposed to redirect dust only from their output side.)}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=16w42a|The developers have attempted to make observers no longer detect [[block]] updates happening to [[air]] blocks, in order to make observer behavior more predictable.<ref>{{bug|MC-107730}}</ref> In the process, they have broken [[redstone]] mechanics a bit, so that the block update bug from the previous snapshot now affects [[redstone repeater]]s and [[redstone comparator]]s, too.<ref>{{bug|MC-108897}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=16w43a|[[File:Observer JE2.png|32px]] The model of observers has now been changed. The rotation of the "arrow" texture has now been fixed so it points in the correct direction.
|General [[redstone]] mechanics for observers now work as they did before [[16w42a]], with the exception of the change named below.
|Observers now output strong power like in 16w39a, except that they, as well as [[redstone repeater]]s and [[redstone comparator]]s, no longer provide block updates to transparent [[block]]s or [[air]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=16w44a|The observer [[block]] update changes relating to [[redstone]] from [[16w42a]] and [[16w43a]] have now been fully reverted.
|The behavior of observers has now been overhauled/redefined: observers now detect the newly added [[Block_updates#Post placement update|shape updates]] instead of [[Block_updates#Neighbor changed update|neighbor updates]]. This change has made observer behavior much more predictable, as unexpected/invisible block updates would no longer trigger observers.<ref>{{bug|MC-107760}}</ref>
|Currently, many block state changes do not emit shape updates (for example, changes that are not saved when the world is unloaded, such as the shape of a fence, or whether or not a repeater is locked).
|Observers have now been changed to emit a 2-game-tick pulse when activated.<ref>{{bug|MC-108697}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* The current observer texture was created because [[Jeb]] kept confusing the front with the back. He said it was inspired by the "rejected texture" created by Tommaso Checchi.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{tweet|tomcc|727044087522713600|Here's my rejected graphics for the Observer, because @darngeek has no artistic sensibility|May 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|jeb_|795625080067866624|I kept confusing myself which side was front and back, so here's something inspired by the works of @_tomcc http://i.imgur.com/IK2d8m2.png}}</ref>
