'''Levitation''' is a [[status effect]] inflicted by [[shulker bullet]]s that causes [[entities]] to uncontrollably float upward.

== Effect ==
Levitation causes the affected entity to float upward. This does not affect [[swimming]] or [[flying]].

An affected entity does not take [[fall damage]] until the effect wears off, after which the entity falls and takes damage as usual from falling. 

Levitation has no effect on players riding entities. {{IN|java}}, it also has no effect on entities that are in water or lava.<ref name=MCPE-76143>{{bug|MCPE-76143||Levitation works even if you are in water or lava|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-83369||The levitation effect doesn't work while entities are inside water}}</ref>

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s mobs are immune to levitation.
*Flying mobs, hovering [[blaze]]s and [[shulker]]s are unaffected by Levitation.

== Notes ==
Mobs tied with [[balloon]]s{{only|education|bedrock|short=1}} exhibit behavior similar to if they had a high level of Levitation. However, this mechanic does not use the Levitation effect.
