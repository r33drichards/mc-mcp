'''Other'''
*Fixed a bug with the biome blending system in [[Vibrant Visuals]] that caused non-surface biomes to be ignored.
*Fixed a bug where a sound played on certain screens after an invalid navigation with gamepad or keyboard even when Text To Speech was disabled.
*Fixed a crash occurring on mobs running the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.delayed_attack}} AI goal.
*Fixed some scenarios where the additional context information for error messages was inaccurate after previously catching an exception.
*Fixed use of a default surface builder by some recent preview builds, biomes no longer require a surface builder. Surfaces in distant chunks now appear correctly when playing on Realms.
* Fixed an issue when inserting items into storage items through the UI. Previously the items inserted could result in gaps in the container stack when it was previously modified through the ItemInventoryComponent API. The storage container now sorts items to remove gaps prior to an item being inserted via the UI.</onlyinclude>
