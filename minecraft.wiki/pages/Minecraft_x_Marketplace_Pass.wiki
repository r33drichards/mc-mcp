'''Minecraft x Marketplace Pass''' is a trailer promoting the release of [[Marketplace Pass]], depicting many of the game's heroes going through content available under the service.

== Summary ==
[[Efe]], [[Zuri]], and [[Kai]] are mining [[deepslate]] [[ores]], when suddenly they're targeted by a [[creeper]]. It explodes right near them, but inadvertently opens up a portal into the [[Minecraft Marketplace]], represented by a heavenly glow. The three walk inside, starting their trek by riding red dragons, before retiring at a modern house where Kai pets a modded poodle. Efe reaches for a glass of water, when suddenly the two notice a rumble; it's none other than a colossal mech suit, which the two have to escape with on cars. They escape from a horrific monster, before launching a space ship that flies past an alien in a UFO and the [[moon]]. Suddenly,a T-Rex emerges in front of the moon, scaring Zuri. It is then revealed to actually be Efe in disguise, before they move into a strange map of flashing, falling blocks.

Kai and Zuri then emerge in a frozen landscape, hitting [[TNT]] over and over with [[pickaxes]]. From there they emerge on a walkway for a fashion show, demonstrating many [[character creator]] items. After the video ends, an eighteen second long sequence of the robot stroking the chin of a dragon plays.
