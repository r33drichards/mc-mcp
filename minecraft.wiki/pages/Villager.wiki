'''Villagers''' are humanoid [[passive mob]]s that inhabit [[village]]s, work at their professions (see [[Villager professions]]), [[breed]], and interact with each other. Their outfit varies according to their occupation and [[biome]], and a [[player]] can [[trade]] with them using [[emerald]]s as currency, with their prices affected by reputation.

== Spawning ==
Each villager spawns with an empty [[#Picking up items|inventory]]. Villagers never spawn with [[armor]] or other equipment, but {{in|java}} a [[dispenser]] can be used to equip armor on a villager.

=== Natural generation ===
Villagers can be found in [[village]]s, which spawn in several [[biome]]s such as [[plains]], [[snowy plains]], [[savanna]]s, [[desert]]s, [[taiga]]s, and [[snowy taiga]]s{{only|bedrock}} and can cut into other biomes such as [[swamp]]s and [[jungle]]s. When the [[village]] is generated, unemployed villagers spawn in them, the number of which depends on the buildings in that village, as some buildings generate villagers inside and some do not.

[[Igloo]] basements always generate with one villager in the left cell and one [[zombie villager]] in the right cell.
* {{IN|Java}}, the generated villager is always unemployed.<ref>{{bug|MC-150296|||WAI}}</ref> The villager cannot pathfind to the [[brewing stand]] or [[cauldron]] to take on a profession unless some of the blocks confining them are broken. The generated zombie villager always has the profession of cleric and becomes unemployed once cured.
** Both mobs are the plains variant. See {{Slink||Appearance}}.
* {{IN|Bedrock}}, the villager has a random profession and the zombie villager is unemployed.
** Both mobs are the snowy variant.
** The villager can change its professions to cleric or leatherworker, due to the presence of the brewing stand and cauldron. The zombie villager can do the same after being cured.
** Changing profession takes time. If the player manages to trade with the villager before it changes its profession, the villager keeps its initial profession.
** The zombie villager is unemployed immediately after being cured, so the player cannot lock in its profession.

=== Curing ===
{{see also|Zombie Villager#Curing}}
Giving a [[zombie villager]] the [[Weakness]] effect and then feeding it a [[golden apple]] starts the curing process. After five minutes, it transforms into a villager, displaying purple [[Nausea]] status effect particles for 10 seconds after being cured.

The villager retains the profession it had, if it had one before turning into a zombie villager. If employed, a cured villager offers discounts on most of its trades.

{{IN|bedrock}}, if the zombie villager is spawned by a player, it adopts a randomly chosen profession. The villager can also be a nitwit, but it becomes a normal unemployed villager when cured.

{{IN|java}}, curing a [[zombie villager]] riding a [[chicken]] results in the villager riding a chicken. Eventually, the villager grows up and gains a profession while still being on the chicken.

== Drops ==
Farmers using [[bone meal]] when [[Farmer#Farming|farming]] have an 8.5% chance to drop it when killed by a player or tamed wolf.{{check the code|Appears to be true for all items when tested with /item replace, but it might not actually happen if it's natural as villagers don't drop the item they're willing to trade if they're holding it}} Each level of [[Looting]] increases the chance by 1% per level. Adult<ref>{{Bug|MC-201107|Baby villager not dropping armor}}</ref> villagers can drop armor equipped through [[dispenser]]s. Otherwise, villagers, whether adult or baby, do not drop any [[item]]s or [[experience]] when killed.

Upon successful trading, a villager drops {{xp|3|6}}.

Upon successful trading, while willing to [[breed]], {{xp|8|11}} is dropped.

Curing a [[zombie villager]] with [[armor]] and [[item]]s causes it to drop them as items.

=== Hero of the Village ===
{{Main|Hero of the Village}}
{{IN|java}}, a villager can drop various items, depending on its profession, by throwing a gift toward a nearby player with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect. The gift is randomly selected from a list of items for the villager's individual profession, and there is a random cooldown before the villager can throw another gift.

== Behavior ==
=== Movement patterns ===

==== Socializing ====
Nitwit and unemployed villagers leave their homes at day and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, periodically making mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, during which they stare at another villager for 4–5 seconds at a time. They continuously stare at a nearby player unless the villager is trying to get into a house at night, farm food, work, or flee from a zombie or illager. Baby villagers may jump on beds and play tag with each other, similarly to how baby [[piglin]]s and baby [[hoglin]]s play tag.

{{IN|bedrock}}, baby villagers do not stop in order to stare at players, and thus continue moving as if the player is not there.

A villager tries not to travel far from its bed in a large village unless the job site or the nearest gossip site ([[bell]]) is far away.

Villagers emit green [[particles]] if they join a village, set a bed, or acquire a job site/profession.

Villagers run inside at night or during rain, closing doors behind them. They attempt to sleep at night, but if they cannot claim a bed, they stay indoors near a bed until morning. In the morning, they head outside and resume normal behavior. However, some villagers, such as nitwits, stay outside later than others unless being chased by an [[illager]] or [[zombie]].

==== Migration ====
If a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it quickly moves back within the boundary. A villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds. Whether in a village or not, a villager never [[despawn]]s.

==== Pathfinding ====
Villagers, like most other mobs, can find paths around obstructions, avoid walking off cliffs of heights greater than 3 blocks, and avoid some blocks that cause harm. However, in crowded situations, one villager can push another off a cliff or into harm's way.

Villagers can open all wooden and copper doors and find paths to blocks of interest behind the doors. However, they cannot open any trapdoors, fence gates, or iron doors. Villagers can climb [[ladders]], but do not recognize them as paths and do not deliberately use them. Any climbing of ladders seems to be a side effect of them being pushed into the block by another mob (usually by other villagers). Climbing a ladder can leave a villager stranded on the second floor and roof of some village structures, as they lack the necessary AI to intentionally ''descend'' ladders.

==== Getting attacked ====
Like other passive mobs, villagers sprint away when attacked, but they also flee from some nearby mobs even before being attacked.

[[Zombie]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s, [[drowned]] and [[zoglin]]s attack villagers and cause them to flee.

[[Pillager]]s, [[vindicator]]s, [[evoker]]s, [[illusioner]]s and [[ravager]]s cause villagers to flee but only attack adults. [[Vex]]es also cause villagers to flee but only attack adults when spawned by an [[evoker]].

[[Pufferfish]], [[warden]]s and [[wither]]s attack villagers but don't cause them to flee until actually attacked.

==== Preferred path ====
{{Exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
When [[pathfinding]], villagers prefer to stay on low cost blocks, such as [[dirt path]]s, [[cobblestone]], [[bricks]], and [[planks]]. They do this by trying to minimize the '''path cost''' of all of the blocks they walk across. They also avoid jumping, because it has a high path cost, but babies don't avoid it as much.

=== Job site blocks ===
{{for|a list of job site blocks and the professions they are required for|#Professions}}

Unemployed villagers (other than babies and nitwits) seek employment at job site blocks (also referred to as workstations), and employed villagers use job site blocks to refresh their trades (see {{slink||Working}}). Villagers who have made their first trade must claim a site block that corresponds with their profession, whereas tradeless villagers may change their profession to match a site block. 

{{IN|java}}, an unemployed villager claims job site blocks by searching for the nearest unclaimed site in a 48-block sphere. When a suitable site block is detected, the villager starts pathfinding to it, staking a provisional claim. This can occur only while the villager is awake. A provisional claim is released if the villager cannot reach the block within 60 seconds, however the villager may try again immediately.<ref>{{bug|MC-257069||Trapped villager can prevent any other villagers from claiming a jobsite}}</ref> To fully claim the site and change profession, the villager must approach within a 2-block radius of the job site's center. When a job site block is fully claimed, its owner emits green particles, and no other villager can claim the block unless the owner relinquishes it. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, all villagers in a village search for unclaimed job sites in a 16 block radius and 4 block height. If a site block is found, it is added to a shared list of valid job site blocks for the whole village. An unemployed villager with a bed claims the first site block on that list and immediately acquires the profession to match, regardless of the distance or accessibility to the site block.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-63311||Villagers claim workstations and beds that are too far away and/or get stuck unemployed}}</ref> The villager can even claim the site block while sleeping. When a job site block is claimed, both the block and the villager making the claim emit green particles and the site block is removed from the list. If a villager cannot pathfind to its claimed site, both the site block and villager emit anger particles. The site block may need to be broken or interacted by a piston before the villager unclaims it.{{Verify|Incredibly inconsistent, needs further testing|edition=bedrock}}

=== Gossiping ===
{{anchor|Reputation}}
{{for|the formula to calculate the exact price based on gossips|Trading#Sale prices}}
[[File:Gossping.png|alt=|thumb|A desert villager and a plains villager gossiping.]]

Villagers can store positive and negative memories about players and share them with other villagers. A player's reputation is determined by these memories, and can be changed by trading with, curing, attacking and killing villagers, which influences [[Trading#Sale prices|trading prices]] and the hostility of [[iron golem]]s.

Killing a villager increases the value of the corresponding gossip for all villagers whom it has a line of sight inside a box extending 16 blocks from the villager in all coordinate directions. [[Trading]] with, [[curing]] or attacking a villager only increases the value of the corresponding gossips for the targeted villager. Attacks and kills only result in negative gossip when villagers can determine their source, so indirect methods like [[fire]], [[lava]] and suffocation from [[falling block]]s can be used to kill villagers without losing reputation.

Villagers can share gossip by talking to each other, though the shared gossip's value will be decreased by the sharing cost. Because the cost of sharing the major gossip gained from curing is greater than its maximum, it can never be shared.

Every 20 minutes, all gossips of a villager decays by the amount in the "Decay" column. This rate does not depend on the time of day and cannot be sped up by sleeping. Because the decay of the major gossip gained from curing is 0, the gossip is permanent.

A player's total reputation with a villager is determined by multiplying each gossip's value by its respective multiplier and adding the results together.

When [[trading]], villagers will [[Trading#Sale prices|change prices]] based on reputation. {{IN|bedrock}} negative reputation can only cancel out positive reputation and other price discounts but not increase the price.

[[Iron golem]]s that were not built by players become hostile toward all players whose reputation is -100 or lower with any villager within a box centered on the golem and extending 10 blocks in every horizontal and 8 in both vertical directions.

=== Picking up items ===
Each villager has eight hidden inventory slots, which are initially empty when the villager is spawned. A villager can fill its inventory slots with items it picks up.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a villager does not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but does collect any [[bread]], [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[wheat]], [[wheat seeds]], [[beetroot]], [[beetroot seeds]], [[torchflower seeds]], [[pitcher pod]]s, and [[bone meal]] within reach.{{info needed|How far can villagers reach items?}} {{IN|java}}, a villager seeks out these items within 4 blocks. The listed items are the only items villagers can pick up, although the {{cmd|item replace}} command can put any arbitrary item into a villager's inventory. Bone meal can be picked up only by a farmer villager. In ''Bedrock Edition'', only farmers can pick up seeds and wheat.

If a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first. If several villagers are next to an item, the same one picks up the item every time. This behavior prevents villagers from effectively sharing food (and thus breeding) in a small space.

When killed or converted to a zombie villager, any inventory item of the villager is lost, even when {{cmd|/gamerule keepInventory}} is set to <code>true</code>.

If {{cmd|/gamerule mob_griefing}} is <code>false</code>, villagers cannot pick up items, and farmer villagers cannot plant or harvest crops.

Like other mobs, villagers have four slots for worn [[armor]], separate from their inventory slots. An adjacent dispenser can equip armor, [[elytra]], [[mob head]]s or [[carved pumpkin]]s to a villager{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-109608|"Villagers cannot be equipped with anything by a dispenser, but that would be a separate issue and a feature request rather than a bug."|Cannot dispense armor or mob heads onto villagers or zombies|Cannot Reproduce}}</ref>, but the armor is not rendered (except for carved pumpkins and mob heads). The equipment functions as normal; for example, a villager wearing an armor piece enchanted with [[Thorns]] can inflict Thorns damage to attackers, and a villager wearing [[Frost Walker]] [[boots]] is able to create [[frosted ice]]. If a villager is converted into a zombie villager, the armor it was wearing is dropped, though it may be able to pick it up and equip it again. A villager with Thorns III deals more damage to zombies that attacked the villager than the villager takes damage.

=== Sharing food ===
[[File:Villager Sharing Food MCPE 1.14.60.png|thumb|right|Villagers sharing carrots.]]

{{IN|Java}}, villagers collect bread, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, wheat seeds, beetroot seeds, and wheat. If a villager has at least 24 of these items, it gives the extra amount to a villager with 4 or fewer of each of these food items. That other villager can also do this until all villagers have shared all items they could (for example, on a group of three villagers one receives 60 bread, then it shares 36 to another villager to keep 24<ref>{{Bug|MC-181525}}</ref>, and that same villager then shares 12 to the third villager).

In the case of wheat, villagers have a distinct behavior. They do the same as other crops, but if a villager has at least 32 wheat, it tries to give half of it to another villager, making both have 16 wheat.

If a villager has 8 full{{verify|Full? Meaning stackable every item is stacked to 64?}} stacks of any kind of food or seeds and then tries to share with another villager, it leaves at least 24 items in each stack. Thus it can never empty inventory slots to pick up other items, unless it uses the items when trying to breed or when farming if it is a farmer villager.<ref>{{Bug|MC-178019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalminecraft/comments/lozawc/villager_food_sharing_java_116/ Villager food sharing (java 1.16)] - Only the last part and the bugs are relevant</ref> A bait villager can be used in a farm taking advantage of this mechanic to have a farmer villager collect and deposit crops.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, if a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 bread or 24 carrots, potatoes, beetroots, or 18 wheat for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread, 12 carrots, 12 potatoes, or 12 beetroots for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, 60 potatoes, or 60 beetroots, or 45 wheat for farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.

To share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager. When wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread, which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.

=== Farming ===
{{main|Farmer#Farming}}
[[File:Villagerpickingup.gif|thumb|Farmer villager picking and planting carrots.]]
Farmer villagers can tend planted [[wheat]], [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, and [[beetroot]]s, harvesting them if they are fully grown or [[bonemealing]] them if possible.

=== Breeding ===
{{for|tutorials on breeding mechanics|Village mechanics#Breeding and population cap|Tutorial:Legacy village mechanics}}

Adult villagers breed depending on the time of the day and need to be willing to spawn {{section link||Baby villagers}}, who require [[bed]]s with at least two empty blocks above their heads. Job sites are not required for villagers to breed.

Breeding depends on the number of valid beds. If a villager is "willing" (see {{slink||Willingness}} below), villagers breed as long as there are unclaimed beds available within the limits of the village. All baby villagers are initially unemployed.

{{IN|java}}, two villagers nearby one another periodically enter mating mode if both have enough food and are not on cooldown. Breeding fails (with angry villager particles displayed) if no unclaimed bed can be reached via pathfinding within a 48-block radius. The appearance of the child is randomly determined by either the biome type of the parents or by the biome where the breeding occurred.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village are counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and the ''spherical'' boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they breed and produce a child. The [[#Appearance|appearance]] is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs {{in|bedrock}}.

==== Willingness ====
[[File:VillagerInLove.png|thumb|right|Two villagers willing to breed.]]

Villagers must be willing to breed. Willingness is determined by the amount of food items a villager has. Becoming willing consumes the villager's food stock; therefore, after mating, villagers cease to be willing for 5 minutes, at which point they must gather a sufficient stock of food items to breed again.

Villagers must have enough beds within village bounds for baby villagers to spawn. The villager must be able to path-find to the bed from its current position. (Note that mobs view certain blocks, such as slabs, trapdoors, etc., as full blocks for pathfinding, so putting these types of blocks above a bed invalidates the bed.)

Villagers can become willing by having either 3 [[bread]], 12 [[carrot]]s, 12 [[potato]]es, or 12 [[beetroot]]s in one slot in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throws food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. If {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is <code>false</code>, villagers don't pick up food or break crops.

=== Baby villagers ===
[[File:Baby Villagers in Java Edition.png|thumb|Some baby villagers in ''Java Edition''. Their heads are smaller than their ''Bedrock Edition'' or ''Minecraft Education'' counterparts.]]

Baby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses at will. They sometimes stop sprinting to stare at other villagers, the player{{only|java}}, or an [[iron golem]]. If the iron golem is holding out a [[poppy]], a child may cautiously take the flower from its hands. Baby villagers tend to group and chase one another around the village as if playing tag. They also jump on beds.

[[Illager]]s (except "Johnny" [[vindicator]]s {{in|BE}}) ignore baby villagers until they reach adulthood.

Baby villagers give gifts of [[poppies]] or [[wheat seeds]] to players who have the {{EffectLink|Hero of the Village}} effect {{in|java}}. 

Baby villagers {{in|Bedrock|education}} have a slightly bigger head than {{in|Java}}; this also can be seen in other baby mobs in the game as well. ''Java Edition'' baby villagers look like tiny normal villagers.<ref>{{bug|MC-180893|||Invalid}}</ref>

Baby villagers can fit through 1×1 block gaps.

A baby villager becomes an adult 20 minutes after birth, even when in a boat or a minecart. Baby villagers with no AI do not grow up.

=== Lightning ===
[[File:Villager becoming Witch.gif|thumb|upright|A villager gets struck by lightning.]]

When [[lightning]] strikes within 3–4 blocks of a villager, the villager is replaced by a [[witch]] that can't despawn. Even a baby villager that is struck by lightning is turned into a two-block-tall witch. 

Iron golems also attack any villagers that turn into witches.

=== Iron golem summoning ===
{{main|Iron Golem#Villages}}

{{IN|java}}, villagers can summon an [[iron golem]] to protect themselves from hostile mobs. This requires either a villager [[#Panicking|panicking]] in a group of 3 villagers or 5 [[#Gossiping|gossiping]] villagers. If they don't find an iron golem within 16 blocks of their location for 30 seconds, another one is summoned.

{{IN|bedrock}}, villagers can summon an iron golem if there are more than 10 villagers per existing golem, the village has at least 20 beds, and 75% of these villagers must have worked in the past day.

=== Panicking ===
[[File:Panicked Villager.gif|thumb|upright|A villager panicking.]]

Villagers sometimes panic during a [[raid]] or a [[zombie siege]] by emitting water particles and shaking.

In ''Java Edition'', villagers panic if they see a mob that is hostile toward villagers, like a zombie, zombie villager, husk, drowned, zoglin, illager, vex, wither, or ravager and flee frantically from them, sometimes hiding in houses.

In ''Bedrock Edition'', villagers panic by running around in circles around a bed in a village house, such as when a raid happens or when the player rings the village bell.

''Java Edition'' villagers in panic are more likely to summon iron golems. To see these mobs, the villager must have an unobstructed line of sight to it (eye-level to eye-level), and be within a certain range (spherical distance between feet center bottom-most point of the villager and hostile mob):

==== Zombies ====
{{main|Siege|Zombie}}

Zombies, zombie villagers, husks, and drowned seek out and attack villagers within a 35– to 52.5–block radius (depending on [[regional difficulty]]){{only|java}} or a 16-block radius{{only|bedrock}} (even when the villager is invisible). Zombies attempt to break down [[door]]s, but only a fraction of zombies can do so and can succeed only when difficulty is set to hard. Zombies who cannot break doors tend to crowd around a door that separates them from a villager. If a zombie or a drowned comes across a set of doors with one open, it usually tries to go through the closed door.

All zombies either kill villagers or convert them into [[zombie villager]]s. The chance of the villager becoming a zombie villager upon death depends on [[difficulty]], being 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by [[zombie]]s as well, becoming baby zombie villagers. Drowned are able to convert villagers into zombie villagers even when attacking with a [[trident]] from a distance.

==== Raids ====
{{main|Raid}}

During a [[raid]], villagers flee from [[illager]]s and run to the nearest [[Village house|house]], similar to a [[zombie siege]]. For a villager to hide, the house must have a door and at least one bed.<!-- hide poi type=bed-->

Before the first raid wave {{in|java}}, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the bell rings automatically regardless of whether a villager is nearby. {{IN|java}}, when a bell is rung, all illagers within 48 blocks get the [[glowing]] effect for 3 seconds. 

A villager often stays in the house it first entered, but may exit the house occasionally. The [[player]] can still trade with villagers during a [[raid]].

{{IN|java}}, the villager displays water [[particles]] on random occasions as if sweating.

=== Hero of the Village ===
{{Main|Hero of the Village}}

{{IN|Java}}, once the player gains the [[Hero of the Village]] status after defeating a raid, villagers give them a discount for their trades and throw them gifts related to their profession. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the villagers do not throw the player gifts, but they still give them a discount for their trades.

=== Staring ===
[[File:Villager Staring.png|thumb|A villager staring at the player.]][[File:An Army of Villagers Staring!.png|thumb|Several villagers staring at the player.]]Villagers stare at any player that stares at them, or goes near them, even if they have the [[Invisibility]] effect. This also applies for some mobs, especially [[cat]]s. A villager first turns its head toward the player, then the body. Villagers can keep staring at the player unless a raid happens or a zombie comes and chases them off.

== Schedules ==
Villagers have set schedules depending on their age and employment status. Schedules define the villager's goals, which mostly determine how they behave throughout the day. However, their goals can be interrupted by higher priority behaviors most villagers have, such as fleeing from an attack, trading, and getting out of the rain.

=== Working ===
Employed villagers spend most of their day standing next to their job site blocks. From time to time, they "gather supplies" by wandering a short distance away, then returning.

Some professions have additional job-specific goals that are part of their work schedule:
* Farmers harvest and sow crops.
* Librarians inspect bookshelves.{{only|bedrock}}

When a villager reaches its job site block, it commences "work". Two times a day, working resupplies any locked trades, even without having a bed or while sitting in a minecart. A villager can "reach" its job site block if the block is in any of the 8 directly adjacent or diagonal block spaces horizontally around it at the height of their feet, or at the 9 blocks below that. Villagers can still "reach" them diagonally, even if they can't see or touch the face of the block.

Employed villagers do not breed with each other during their work schedule. Nitwits and unemployed villagers do not follow this rule, as they can breed with each other and employed villagers that are not working.

Leatherworker villagers can work at any cauldron, not only their job site block. Also, the cauldron does not have to be filled with water in order for the villager to work at it.

=== Wandering ===
All villagers wander from time to time, but for the unemployed and nitwits, they wander for the majority of their day. A wandering villager chooses a random block and walks toward it, then stands there for a variable amount of time before wandering again. If at any time it detects a job site block it can claim, it does so, assumes the skin for the associated profession, and immediately begins following the appropriate schedule.

A villager attempts to claim a job site block by finding a path to a block next to one, showing angry particles when unable to reach it. After a villager fails to reach the job site block several times, it becomes unclaimed, indicated by showing angry particles on it. The villager loses its job site block and eventually becomes unemployed if the villager is at novice-level and no nearby job site block is available. Any other nearby unemployed villager has a chance to become the block's new owner. If there are no unemployed villagers nearby, then the villager who lost the job site block seeks for another unclaimed one or tries to reclaim the same unreachable one in an endless loop (this also happens for claiming beds).

The wander schedule includes a job-specific goal called "exploring the outskirts" that causes villagers to wander near the edges of the village. This enables them to detect new beds, job site blocks, bells, and houses that players have used to extend the village. 

During this time of the day, they may also share items.

=== Gathering ===
Late in the day, adult villagers gather at a meeting place (the area around a [[bell]]). When two villagers encounter one another, they mingle (look at each other and "converse" by humming at other villagers). They may also share food, or breed if both are willing.

If a villager isn't close enough to detect a bell, it wanders randomly, searching for one.

=== Playing ===
[[File:ChildrenTag.png|thumb|Four villager children chasing another baby villager.]]

Baby villagers wander randomly around the village. When they encounter another baby villager, the two of them follow each other for a while and sometimes run as if racing or chasing each other. 

{{IN|java}}, they sometimes stop to jump and bounce on a bed or to stare at an iron golem they encounter. {{IN|bedrock}}, if the [[iron golem]] offers them a poppy, the baby villager cautiously accepts it.

=== Returning home ===
All villagers head home a short time before sunset. They roam around until they get near their beds, then target a block beside the bed. The bed's head must be accessible for the villagers to "see" it. Once they reach their beds, they do not go through a door again before sleeping.

A villager who has no bed simply waits inside a house until morning. This includes players stealing a villager's bed to sleep in, mostly the villager stays in the house and doesn't move until sunrise. But sometimes, if they detect an unclaimed bed nearby they walk out of the house and toward the bed.
[[File:How Do You Even Sleep!.png|thumb|A villager pushed on a bed in ''Java Edition''. The villager falls off the bed if it is pushed again.]]
[[File:The Anvil Bounces on a Sleeping Villager.png|thumb|In ''Java Edition'', when a villager is sleeping, the hitbox is reduced to only the half of the bed with the pillow. Therefore, dropping an anvil on the other half of the bed does not hurt the villager nor does it cause the villager to wake up.]]

=== Sleeping ===
[[File:Villager sleeping.png|thumb|A top view of a savanna villager sleeping in a bed at night.]] 

At sunset, villagers lie down in their beds and remain there until morning. Villagers wake early if food is thrown at them{{only|java}}, they are pushed out of bed, or if their bed is destroyed. <!-- Note: This is the current behavior in Bedrock, but some of it may be due to bugs.-->They also wake up when their bed is {{ctrl|used}}, if they are {{ctrl|attacked}}, or when a bell is rung.
If possible, they return to sleeping in a bed after the interruption.

Jumping on a bed with a villager sleeping in it does not cause the villager to get up. 

In ''Java Edition'', a villager can be pushed on its bed and sometimes turn its head. A villager can be pushed off a bed,<ref>{{bug|MC-145707|||WAI}}</ref> but is most likely to go back to sleeping after staring at the player who pushed the villager for a few seconds. 

When sleeping in ''Java Edition'', a villager's hitbox reduces to a cube restricted to the pillow part of the bed. If an anvil is dropped on the hitbox, the villager takes damage and wakes up and the anvil is dropped as an item. 

In ''Bedrock Edition'', dropping an anvil on a villager that is sleeping causes the villager to take damage but remain sleeping in the bed and the anvil remains on top of the bed. 

A villager who has no bed continues wandering in search of a bed to claim.

Villagers follow their Overworld schedules regardless of which dimension they are in. They can sleep in [[the Nether]] or [[the End]], without causing the usual consequences of the bed exploding (See {{slink|Bed|Sleeping}}), if the Overworld's time is correct.<ref>{{bug|MC-146515||Villagers can sleep in all dimensions|WAI}}</ref> This is because the daylight cycle continues in these dimensions, even though it is not normally apparent to the player.

Sometimes when a villager gets in a bed from another direction they turn their body until their head is on the pillow of the bed. Villagers also sleep with their eyes open.

=== Healing ===
A villager gets a brief regeneration effect once leveling up in its profession. Pink regeneration particles ({{EffectSprite|particle-regeneration}}) appear while it is healing.

{{IN|bedrock}}, when a villager successfully sleeps, they immediately heal themselves when waking up at dawn (if they are hurt).

Each villager can have a profession except for the nitwit, indicated by their clothing as well as by the title at the top of the [[trading interface]]. A villager can choose their profession by claiming a job site block. When they go to work, they use their daily schedule to get to their claimed job site block. Some professions, like farmers and librarians, do other things. Farmers plant crops, and librarians can inspect bookshelves. If an adult villager does not have a profession (either they are unemployed or a nitwit), they wander instead.

A job site block can be claimed only if it is unclaimed. Removal of a claimed job site block causes the owner to switch to another profession or become unemployed, provided that the villager has no prior trades with the player. If the villager has prior trades, it keeps its profession and claims a new job site block that matches its profession if one is available. This means that once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever.

Nitwits and baby villagers cannot change their profession.

{{IN|java}}, villagers summoned by a spawn egg or via command {{cmd|summon}} are always unemployed until they have claimed a job site block. {{IN|bedrock}}, however, villagers summoned in similar ways have a random profession<ref>{{bug|MCPE-46034}}</ref>; their profession can be changed by a job site block, though.

Novice-level villagers who have not yet traded can lose their profession and change into unemployed villagers.

Unemployed adults actively seek for an unclaimed job site block and change into the corresponding profession.

Below is a table listing the various professions, along with the specific job site block that each profession requires (13 jobs in total, not including unemployed/nitwit):

=== Nitwit ===
{{main|Nitwit}}
[[File:Nitwit_refusing.gif|thumb|upright|A nitwit bobbling its head.{{only|java}}]]

Nitwit villagers wear robes that are green on top. They cannot change their profession, [[trade]], or gather around [[bell]]s, but are still able to breed. They are not equipped with a level stone since they cannot trade.

{{IN|java}}, pressing {{control|use}} on a nitwit causes it to grunt and bobble its head at the [[player]]. A nitwit must be born or spawned; no villagers change to nitwit from unemployed or a profession, and vice versa. Due to a bug, nitwits cannot spawn in through breeding.<ref>{{bug|MC-156556}}</ref> As such, they can only be found naturally or by [[#Curing|curing]] naturally spawned zombie villagers. Zombie villagers can also be spawned as babies, so this is the only way to encounter baby nitwits in Survival mode.

{{IN|bedrock}}, every baby villager has a 10% chance to become a nitwit when they become an adult, as well as having a different sleep schedule where they wander around the village for about 2000 ticks (1 minute 40 seconds) after other villagers go to sleep, before seeking a bed. If they can claim a bed, they arise in the morning 2000 ticks after the rest of the village wakes up.

=== Appearance ===
Villagers and [[zombie villager]]s have seven skin types corresponding to the biome they spawn in. Their appearance also varies based on their profession and their five tiers. They show which trade tier they have unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their belt. A new tier is obtained every time a player trades with a villager and the badge appears as stone, iron, gold, emerald, and finally diamond.

Villagers have different outfits depending on their biome. Naturally generated villagers take on the outfit from the biome they were spawned in. When breeding occurs, the outfit of the child is determined by the biome where the breeding occurs, but {{in|java}}, there is a 50% chance it's inherited from the biome type of the parents (equal chance for both parents). In case the villager's outfit is determined by biome but the biome has no specific villager type, it always becomes a plains villager. The outfits available are the following:

The trading system is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows players to buy and sell various [[item]]s to and from villagers, using [[emerald]]s as a currency. Their trades can be valuable or somewhat meaningless, depending on the cost, the [[item]]s the player might get, and how the player treats the villagers.

Only adult villagers with professions can trade; the player cannot trade with nitwits, unemployed villagers, or baby villagers. Attempting to do so causes the villager to display a head-bobbling animation and play the villager's declined trade sound{{only|java}}.

Pressing the {{control|use}} control on an employed villager allows a player to trade, making offers based on the villager's profession and profession level. All offers involve emeralds as a currency, and items related to the villager's profession.

Trading can allow the acquisition of items that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain, such as [[enchanted book]]s with "treasure" enchantments (e.g. [[Mending]]), [[bottles o' enchanting]], or [[Chainmail Armor|chainmail]] [[armor]].

When a villager gets a new trade, they receive 10 seconds of [[Regeneration]] I (totaling to {{hp|4}} of restoration), which emits pink particles. The villager also emits green particles suggesting contentment.

Completing a trade with a villager increases its professional level, and makes the villager drop {{xp|3|6}}; while willing to [[breed]], instead, {{xp|8|11}} is dropped. Some trades grant higher levels to the villager than others. As it advances through its profession, the villager offers additional trades. When a villager unlocks a new trade at a higher level, it almost always grants more experience than lower-level trades.

Villagers have a maximum supply of items and after the player has traded for an item that many times, the villager's supply of the item is exhausted. This results in the trade being temporarily locked. A player can continue to trade for the villager's other available items if any. Exhausted items are restocked when the villager works at a job site, up to twice per [[Daylight cycle|day]].

Clicking {{control|use}} on an unemployed or nitwit villager {{in|Java}} causes it to grunt and bobble their head; doing so {{in|Bedrock}} does nothing.

Using a [[name tag]] on a villager always names the villager instead of opening the trading interface.

{{IN|java}}, using {{keys|space}} inside of the trading interface after one trade was made refills the trading slots with items from the inventory.{{verify|Does this always work, or only when a trade is selected from the trading list? Does this also work on Bedrock Edition?}}

=== Supply and demand ===
{{For|detailed information on Villager economics|Trading#Economics}}
The price of an item can rise and fall with changes in demand. The price of a traded item can rise when next resupplied, or fall from a risen price if not traded. Demand is stored per item, not per villager.

=== Trade offering ===
[[File:VillagerOfferingItems.jpg|thumb|Several villagers offering trade items to a player.|alt=]]

When a [[player]] holds an [[emerald]] or other item near a villager who wants that item, the villager holds up an item it offers in exchange. {{IN|bedrock}}, villagers raise their arms when showing trade items. For example, a farmer villager who buys 20 [[wheat]] for one emerald holds up an emerald, offering it to a player holding wheat.

If the villager has more than one trade for an item, it cycles through the trades, offering a different item every few seconds. This kind of trading interaction makes it easier to find villagers who offer a particular trade, but the player must still open the trading interface to complete the trade. Note that villagers do not hold items to offer trades during their [[#Schedules|gather or sleep phases]], even though it is still possible to trade with them.

Villagers do not offer trades that are currently out of stock.

=== Economic trade ===
Villagers have various professions that progress through experience-based levels, unlocking new trade tiers.

* To rank up a villager, the [[player]] needs to trade. Trading with a Novice-level villager adds 1 or 2 XP per trade and each level progressively gains more XP per trade until the Master rank which earns up to 30 XP per trade. To see more, go to [[Trading#Trade offers|Trading]]. 

=== Popularity or reputation ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, villagers increase their prices of trades if a player's [[popularity]] is low, (e.g. from [[Damage/Mobs|damaging]] villagers), and decrease it if their popularity is high (e.g. from trading with multiple villagers). [[#Curing|Curing]] a [[zombie villager]] also increases the player's popularity by 10.

{{IN|java}}, a villager's prices are affected by the player's [[#Gossiping|reputation]] with that villager rather than by village popularity.

=== Hero of the Village ===
{{main|Hero of the Village}}

When a player receives {{EffectLink|Hero of the Village}}, players receive discounted prices on all the items traded by villagers in both editions. The {{EffectLink|Hero of the Village}} also gets gifts.{{only|java}}

Each villager throws gifts related to its profession, and nitwits and unemployed villagers throw wheat seeds instead. These gifts range in value from common (like [[seeds]]) to rare items (like [[chainmail armor]]).

A player's popularity increases by 10 {{in|Java}} and doesn't increase {{in|Bedrock}}. Villagers also shoot off [[fireworks]], with different colored fireworks with no pattern.

== Trivia ==
* The villagers were inspired by the shopkeepers in ''{{w|Dungeon Master II}}''.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/xfzdg/i_am_markus_persson_aka_notch_creator_of/c5m0p26</ref>
* Originally, the mobs populating villages were to be [[pigmen]].<ref>{{tweet|notch|62531431175421952|It's very likely the townspeople will be pigmen {{=}})|April 25, 2011}}</ref>
* When a villager is in love mode, it walks slowly. However, when a villager runs indoors as the night falls, it runs faster than the player's sprinting speed.
* The villager skins added in the [[Village and Pillage]] update were inspired by 2018 fashion shows, such as Gucci's.<ref>{{tweet|Jappa|1101053487268417536|Fun Fact: Most of the villager designs were inspired by 2018 fashion shows like Gucci's.|February 28, 2019}}</ref>
* Villagers are genderless, meaning they are neither male nor female.<ref>{{tweet|HelenAngel|1104097613081526272|Villagers are genderless- they are neither male nor female.|March 8, 2019}}</ref>
* Villagers occasionally sleep in odd ways during the night inside their beds, sometimes hanging halfway off the side of the bed or even glitching into walls.
* Although the villages in [[snowy taiga]] biomes spawn the snowy villager variant {{in|bedrock}}, they use the [[taiga]] village variant.
* {{IN|java}}, when the Programmer Art resource pack is enabled, all villagers wear a green hood on their heads.<ref>{{bug|MC-141075}}</ref> This is because the Programmer Art nitwit texture (which is directly copied from the pre-1.14 vanilla resource pack and had the hood in the texture since its addition) is called the same as the [[Village & Pillage]] base villager texture (<code>...\entity\villager\villager.png</code>).
** {{IN|bedrock}}, when the Classic Textures pack from the [[Marketplace]] is enabled, the villagers still use their default texture instead of the old texture.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-119646|resolution=Invalid}}</ref> This is because the old textures of villager are located in <code>...\entity\villager</code>, while the textures for new villagers are in <code>...\entity\villager2</code>.
* Giving a villager any item (with commands) causes it to hold the item as if offering it, but it cannot be traded.
* Fisherman villagers have been intentionally textured by [[Jasper Boerstra]] to display the long-since-removed raw fish texture.<ref>{{bug|MC-173917|resolution=Works As Intended}}</ref>
* Villagers display their held items differently than most creatures do, using the "ground" parameter instead of the usual hand parameter in model display settings.
* Villagers (and baby villagers) on boats that have claimed a bed can still sleep when the bed is near to them resulting in them sleeping in the boat instead.{{only|bedrock}}
* Ancient villagers have been shown in ''Minecraft Legends'', although they were hinted at in ''Minecraft Dungeons''.
* {{IN|java}}, the [[death messages]] of villagers are recorded in the game's logs.<ref>{{bug|MC-165985||Villager deaths are logged|WAI}}</ref>
* Baby villagers taking poppies from iron golems is a reference to the 1986 Japanese animated movie ''{{W|Castle in the Sky|newtab=1}}'', in which a giant robot covered in vines (inspiration for the iron golem) gives the main characters flowers to put on a memorial.<ref>{{tweet|jonkagstrom|172728720799436801|@scambot Yes, thanks to @pgeuder who sent me inspirational pictures!|February 23, 2012}}</ref>
<!-- Please do not claim that Samuel Åberg created the sounds for the villagers in the game. He did not create the sounds for the villagers, he merely demonstrated how the sounds were made in the video about how Minecraft sounds are made. The villager sounds were made by C418 back in 2013. -->
* Their vocal sounds are performed by [[Daniel Rosenfeld]].<ref>[https://www.20k.org/episodes/minecraft <nowiki>Daniel also used his voice for the villagers who inhabit the strange, isolated towns. Dallas’s Daughter: All they go is “Hmm hmm hmm.” Daniel: I think some sound effects got lost with the villagers, because I originally did the "eh" sounds [sfx: Minecraft villager], but then I also made very contrasting sound effects for the children villagers. They were like, "Hahahaha." Like screechy little kids. And I'm kind of bummed that that never got into the game, because like what they put in the game ultimately was just the “eh” but pitched up, [sfx: Minecraft villager child] which was really bizarre for little children. Like “eeeh.”</nowiki>]</ref>
* If a villager accidentally harms a neutral or hostile mob by setting off a firework, the mob retaliates and attacks the villager. For example, a villager that accidentally damages a player by setting off a firework causes tamed wolves and trusting foxes to attack the villager.

=== April Fools ===
{{main|Easter eggs#2014}}
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}

On April 1, 2014, Mojang announced that villagers have taken over the skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke. This caused the player's current skin to turn into villager skins, and caused users to be unable to change their skins unless modifying the [[launcher]].json file. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).

Many of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers. They seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds). The in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the "Game of Thrones" theme on the title screen. The sounds originate from the sound resource pack created by Element Animation, titled The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P.), which is based on the villagers appearing in their fan videos. The villagers were voiced by Dan Lloyd, Director of Element Animation.

The skins and the sounds were reverted to the way they were before on April 2, 2014. However, since this was a server side update, this update cannot be activated by setting the computer's date to April 1, 2014.
