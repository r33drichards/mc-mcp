{{Split|World Options|Edit World|reason=Edit world in Bedrock is a completely different mechanic than in Java, literally nothing on this page applies to both editions}}

The '''world options''' or '''edit world''' screen are options to manage a world's files and its settings. {{IN|je}}, internal world settings can't be changed from the edit world screen and are handled by [[game rule]]s, while {{In|be}}, game rules, [[add-ons]], [[experiments]], and other world settings can be changed at any time from the edit world screen, even from the [[pause menu]].

== ''Java Edition'' ==
[[File:Edit World JE.png|alt=A world's edit screen.|thumb|A [[world]]'s edit screen.]]
A player can click on a world to select it, and thereby access the options of it. Then, some options appear at the bottom of the screen. 

There are a total of 9 operations that can be performed from the world options, some of which are contained within the "Edit World" screen.

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
<templatestyles src=":Minecraft_Wiki/styles.css/editcopy" />
The edit world screen {{in|bedrock}} allows for various settings, most [[game rules]], [[add-on]]s, and [[experiment]]s to be changed. Worlds that are stored locally on the device can be edited, as well as worlds in an owned [[Realms]] server. The edit world screen for local worlds uses [[Ore UI]], while the edit world screen for ''Minecraft'' Realms uses the Classic UI, making them look vastly different while offering almost the same options. The Ore UI version of the edit world screen for ''Minecraft'' Realms can be enabled with a button at the top in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''.

The world options for local worlds can also be viewed and edited from the [[settings]] in the [[pause menu]], which uses the Classic UI in release versions and Ore UI in ''[[Preview]]''. In the pause menu, most options are located in sections in the "Game" tab (except Multiplayer), and some are not available or named differently.

=== Ore UI ===
The edit world screen for local worlds can be opened from the "Worlds" tab in the [[play screen]] by selecting the "Edit" button on a world, or by pressing {{xbtn|x}}/{{psbtn|tr}} for controllers on a selected world. The Ore UI version of the edit world screen for ''Minecraft'' Realms can be opened by the Realm owner by selecting "Edit World" on a world in the Edit Realm screen and selecting the button at the top.

The menu shows the world thumbnail with some buttons and a tab list on the left, and the world options for each selected tab on the right.

Below, there are seven sections which open the respective world options on the right: General, Advanced, Multiplayer, Cheats, Resource packs, Behavior packs, and Experiments.

When the world has been created from a [[Marketplace]] template, some options may be locked by the creator. The options can be unlocked by selecting the message at the top, but this may result in different gameplay than the creator intended for the template.

Some options and custom [[add-ons]] may permanently disable [[achievements]] for the world, which are shown with a message on the top. Enabling add-ons or [[experiments]] shows a warning message as well.

=== Classic UI ===
[[File:BE Game settings (Pause menu).png|thumb|The "Game" settings tab in the pause menu.]]
The edit world screen in ''Minecraft'' [[Realms]], the game settings in the [[pause menu]], and ''[[Bedrock Editor]]'' use the Classic UI, which looks vastly different from Ore UI and offers some different options. The edit world screen for Minecraft Realms can be opened by the Realm owner by selecting "Edit World" on a world in the Edit Realm screen. The game settings in the pause menu can be opened by selecting "Settings" in the pause menu. The world options tabs are located in the "World" or "Realm" section on the left, and the add-on tabs are located in the Add-Ons tab at the bottom.

The edit project screen in ''Bedrock Editor'' only affects the world after exportation, and allows all options to be changed including normally grayed out options.

==== Add-Ons ====
Enabling and disabling [[resource packs]] and [[behavior packs]] works exactly the same as in the Ore UI version of the edit world screen, however, the buttons are located differently. All packs are located behind collapsible section headers. The options for each pack can be viewed by selecting a pack. Press "Activate" or "Deactivate" to enable or disable packs, and press "View in Store" to open the purchase screen in the Marketplace for Marketplace packs. Activated packs can be moved in the list by selecting an arrow button on the bottom-right of a pack. For activated packs only, the technical details screen can be opened by pressing the green checkmark button on the right.

All activated and available resource packs and behavior packs can be viewed from the pause menu, but none of them can be activated or deactivated while in the world. Additionally, on ''Minecraft'' Realms, locally stored custom packs in {{File|directory|development_resource_packs}} and {{File|directory|development_behavior_packs}} but this can be bypassed by storing them in the regular resource packs and behavior packs directories.
