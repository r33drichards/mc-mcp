'''Bedrock Editor v0.3.2''', is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on March 22, 2023, which fixes bugs.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/14204477222157</ref><ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/95</ref>

== Fixes ==
* Fixed issues with UI not scaling properly when the resolution or game window size is updated.
* Item drops have been disabled in Editor. 
** This allows for Undo/Redo and Cut/Copy/Paste to work properly. 
** Items can’t be dropped in Tool mode or Crosshair mode. 
* Fixed a bug where Tool mode would use the 3rd person camera if it was the active camera when switching from Crosshair mode ({{EditorBug|56|991927|1}}, {{EditorBug|92|992927|1}}). 
** Crosshair mode will still remember your state and return to your previous setting when switch back to Crosshair mode.
* Fixed issues where camera control was disabled when using a Nether or End Portal in Crosshair mode ({{EditorBug|66|991931}}).
* Removed the old stonecutter and Nether reactor core from the block picker.
