'''Short grass''' is a non-solid plant [[block]] that may drop [[wheat seeds]] when broken. Its color is [[biome]]-dependent, and matches the color of [[grass block]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
When [[Breaking|broken]] normally, short grass has a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 unit of [[wheat seeds]] when destroyed. This is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III.

Short grass can be obtained as an item by destroying it with [[shears]]. [[Tall grass]] also drops two units of short grass when broken using shears.

Placing any block on short grass breaks the grass, and it does not drop anything.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Tall Grass Height.jpg|thumb|Height variation of short grass {{in|be}}]]
Short grass generates in the form of [[random patch]]es, on [[grass block]]s in most biomes with grassy soil, like [[plains]] or [[forest]]s.

Short grass may generate on top of [[farmland]] in the "wheat farm" room of [[woodland mansion]]s in place of [[wheat crops]].

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|short-grass}}

=== Post-generation ===
[[Bone meal]] can be used on a grass block or [[moss block]] to grow short grass.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Short grass can be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]]s, [[pale moss block]]s and [[farmland]].
[[File:Short grass placeable on.png|thumb|All the blocks that short grass can be placed on.]]

=== Grazing ===
When a [[sheep]] eats short grass, the block is destroyed, and a [[shear]]ed sheep regrows its [[wool]]. Baby sheep graze grass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

=== Composting ===
Placing short grass into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Bone meal ===
[[Bone meal]] can be used on short grass to create [[tall grass]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Short Grass|Grass}}

== Trivia ==
*Short grass cannot be directly set on [[fire]] from [[lightning]]. However, fire from nearby blocks can spread to it. The top of short grass can be lit but it does not burn this way.
*Short grass is slightly offset from the block it is sitting on (as seen in the second screenshot). This causes fields of short grass to appear more contiguous.
** This offset is solely determined by x and z [[coordinates]], regardless of [[dimension]] or [[world seed]]. Based on this feature, it is possible to calculate the coordinates where a screenshot is taken, if the screenshot includes enough short grass.
**This can sometimes cause short grass to clip horizontally or vertically through block corners.<ref>{{bug|MC-63199||Grass shows through block|WAI}}<br>{{bug|MC-19005||tall grass texture goes through blocks|WF}}</ref>
*Short grass can appear in caves on dirt, even if there's no light source nearby.
*Using bone meal on a grass block in a spawn-protected area on a [[server]] still produces grass and flowers.
*The original texture for short grass was based on the grass texture from an early version of one of Notch's games, [https://s3.amazonaws.com/ld48/index.html Prelude Of The Chambered].
