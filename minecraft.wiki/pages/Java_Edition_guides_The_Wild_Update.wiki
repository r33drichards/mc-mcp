This guide is a simplified overview of '''all non-experimental changes''' in [[The Wild Update]] update ({{JE}} 1.19.''x'' releases), which assumes at least some familiarity with the [[Caves & Cliffs]] updates (''Java Edition'' 1.17.''x'' and 1.18.''x'' releases).

== Mobs ==
=== New ===
{|{{Simple Guide table|New Mobs}}
|-
|[[Warden]]
|[[File:Warden.gif|84px]]
|Summoned when a player triggers a natural [[sculk shrieker]] four times.
| 
* {{Drop|Block|Sculk Catalyst|1}}
* {{xp|1|3}} (when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]])
|
* The first fully blind mob. In order to find a target, it relies on vibrations, smell, and contact.
* Rises out of the floor when summoned. Digs back into the ground when it reverts back to a calm state and doesn't detect a vibration in 60 seconds.
* Has the highest health out of all mobs in ''Java Edition''.
* Is immune to fire, lava, and knockback.
* A warden starts out searching for a target, slowly getting more agitated as it gets more suspicious of a mob. When fully agitated, it roars and then pursues the target.
* A warden instantly becomes fully agitated when hit by another mob.
* Wardens possess an extremely powerful melee attack, which can also disable shields.
* If a target is still being pursued, but out of reach for warden's melee attack, warden hits the target with a ranged sonic boom attack, which bypasses shields and armor.
|-
|[[Frog]]
|{{Animate|Temperate Frog JE1 BE1.png;Cold Frog JE1 BE1.png;Warm Frog JE1.png|84px}}
|[[Swamp]] and [[mangrove swamp]]
|{{xp|1|3}} (when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]])
|
* Spawns when a tadpole grows up.
* Frogs have three color variations, each depending on the temperature of the biome it spawns in. Temperate biomes spawn orange frogs, cold biomes spawn green frogs, and warm biomes spawn white frogs.
* Eats tiny [[slime]]s to produce slimeballs.
* Eats tiny [[magma cube]]s to produce [[froglight]]s. The type of frog influences the froglight's color.
|-
|[[Tadpole]]
|[[File:Tadpole JE1 BE1.png|84px]]
|None
|None
|
* Spawns when hatching from [[frogspawn]].
* Grows up into a frog.
* Possesses the traits of a fish mob, like requiring water, being able to be placed in a [[water bucket]], and flopping around outside of water.
|-
|[[Allay]]
|[[File:Allay BE1.gif|84px]]
|
* [[Woodland mansion]]
* [[Pillager outpost]]
|None
|
* Flies around and follows the player.
* Looks for dropped items of the same kind as the item given to it by the player. After a while, it brings those items to the player.
* If a [[note block]] is played nearby, the allay leaves the items on top of the note block instead.
* Can be duplicated by giving them an [[amethyst shard]] while dancing.
