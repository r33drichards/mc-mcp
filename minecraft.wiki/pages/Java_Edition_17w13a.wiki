== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:TerracottaSnapshotComparison.png|thumb|right|250px|Comparison of the terracotta texture changes.]]

'''[[Glazed terracotta]]'''
* Textured changed for cyan, magenta, orange, and white glazed terracotta, to remove unintentional and potentially offensive imagery.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/5sspmk/minecraft_snapshot_17w06a/ddhjm42/?context=1</ref>

'''[[Beacon]]s'''
* Now display their name when hovering over them.

'''[[Enchantment table]]s'''
* Now display their name when hovering over them.

=== Items ===
'''[[Fishing rod]]s'''
* Changed the sound of bobbers being thrown.

=== General ===
'''[[Achievement/Java Edition|Achievements]]'''
* Removed and replaced by advancements.

'''[[Crafting]]'''
* Closing the crafting interface with items inside no longer drops the items in front of the player, but sends them instead to the inventory.

'''Java version'''
* This is the first snapshot to use, and thus require, Java 8.<ref name="java 8">{{tweet|Dinnerbone|847408242233704448|Heads up modders: This snapshot is the first Minecraft version to require (and therefore use) Java 8. You can now finally use 7/8 features!|January 30, 2017}}</ref>

'''Moving backwards'''
* The player's body now entirely faces to the front, when moving backwards.<ref>{{bug|MC-114900}}, resolved as "Works as Intended" – Maria Lemón, April 22, 2017</ref><ref>{{reddit|66s2px/in_17w16b_players_can_now_run_backwards_without|dglwcfv|It actually is a bug, it tries to rotate the body to the direction you are walking, but it can only do it so far, that is also why it basically picks a 'random direction'. Now it can actually understand when it is walking backwards and it stopped doing that weird behavior.|_Grum|April 22, 2017}}</ref>
** Prior to this snapshot, moving backwards would cause the player model to rotate one side, making it look like the player was strafing backwards somewhat.

== Fixes ==

'''From the current version, hotfixed'''
* Fixed the game not loading on macOS.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* 17w13a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* 17w13a has the longest wait between snapshots on the same development version, with 50 days having elapsed since the release of [[17w06a]] on February 8, 2017.
** Until this point, the longest waits had been those between [[14w11b]] and [[14w17a]], which spanned 42 days.
