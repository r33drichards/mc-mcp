A '''golden apple''' is a [[food]] item that bestows beneficial effects when consumed ([[Absorption]] and [[Regeneration]]) and is also used to cure a [[zombie villager]] under the [[Weakness]] effect into a normal [[villager]]. It is not possible to turn golden apples into [[enchanted golden apple]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
On the base of <code>ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2</code>, a single golden apple is contained in the [[chest]]. Eating it at that location unlocks the [[piston]] doors to the [[redstone]] labs beneath.

|Output= Golden Apple
|type= Foodstuff
}}

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management|title1=Hunger management}}

To eat a golden apple, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. It restores {{hunger|4}} points of hunger and 9.6 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

Unlike most foods, golden apples can be eaten even if the hunger bar is full.

The golden apple provides: 
*[[Absorption]] I for 2 minutes (providing {{hp|4|absorption=1|notag=1}})
*[[Regeneration]] II ({{hp|1}} every 25 ticks, {{hp|2|notag=1}} × 0.4 per second) for 5 seconds (long enough to heal {{hp|4|notag=1}})

{{IN|Bedrock}}, eating multiple golden apples in a row causes the Absorption effect to stack, up to {{hp|16|absorption=1}} points of absorption health.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-160490||Eating Golden Apples continues to increase Absorption Hearts up to 8}}</ref>

=== Curing zombie villagers ===
{{main|Zombie Villager#Curing}}

A golden apple and a splash [[potion of Weakness]] can be used to convert a [[zombie villager]] into a regular [[villager]].

=== Horses ===
Golden apples can be used for improving the chances of taming a [[horse]] by 10%, for [[breeding]], leading and healing horses, and for speeding up the growth of baby horses by 4 minutes.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s run toward any golden apple item on the ground and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory. However, piglins do not eat golden apples (or any [[food]]).
