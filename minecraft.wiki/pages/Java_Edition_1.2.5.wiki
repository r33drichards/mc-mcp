'''1.2.5''' is a minor update to {{JE}} released on April 4, 2012,<ref name="Pre">{{cite|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330210121/http://www.mojang.com/2012/03/minecraft-1-2-5-prerelease/-url=|title=Minecraft 1.2.5 Prerelease|author=Jens Bergensten|website=Mojang.com|date=March 30, 2012|quote=The exact same version will be added to the launcher on Wednesday April 4, at 15:00 CEST}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|jeb_|187539246964416513|Ok, 1.2.5 is finally out. The launcher log will be updated after my reddit AMA|4 Apr 2012|name=[[Jens Bergensten]]|archive=yes}}</ref> which improves functionality of the {{control|pick block}} key, and fixes some of the bugs and crashes in 1.2.4.

A pre-release for 1.2.5 was released on March 30, 2012,<ref name=Pre/> although the full release is identical to this pre-release.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Furnace (S) JE2 BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Furnace]]'''
* {{key|Shift}}-clicking items in the player's inventory now places the item in its respective furnace slot.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Tuxedo_Cat_JE1_BE1.png;Red_Cat_JE1_BE1.png;Siamese_Cat_JE1_BE1.png|64px}} [[Cat]]s'''
* Are now less eager to sit on things.
* Are now less patient.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* When the hotbar is full, using {{ctrl|pick block}} replaces the held item.

=== General ===
'''Direct connect dialog'''
* Now remembers the last server address for the current session.

'''Game files'''
* Inside the {{cd|META-INF}} folder in {{cd|[[minecraft.jar]]}}, the digital signature files ({{cd|MOJANG_C.DSA|MOJANG_C.SF|d=,}}) have been renamed to {{cd|CODESIGN.RSA|CODESIGN.SF|d=and}}.
** Function remains the same.

== Fixes ==
'''14 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed issues when detecting certain links in chat.
* Fixed wild ocelots behaving like tamed ocelots.
* Fixed various chat crashes.
* Fixed world generation failing under certain circumstances.
* Fixed issues turning off sound under certain circumstances.
* Removed all ghost entities "under the command of [[Lord Herobrine]]"<ref name=Pre/>.
* Fixed crash when pasting certain characters in chat.
* Fixed slash key not behaving correctly in certain environments.
* Fixed command matching not being strict enough (for example: typing {{cd|/stopppp}} no longer stops a server).
* Fixed not being able to click colored links.
* Fixed potential issue with [[village]] door detection (which could cause too many [[villager]]s to [[Mob spawning|spawn]]).
* Using a stack of bowls on mooshrooms no longer consumes the whole stack of bowls.
* Made punching a TNT block with flint and steel in hand destroy and drop the TNT block (right-clicking will activate the TNT).
* Fixed {{key|⌘+Q}} shortcut not quitting the app on macOS.

== Trivia ==
* This is the last version where singleplayer doesn't use an internal server.
