'''1.18 experimental snapshot 7''' is the seventh and final experimental snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on September 8, 2021,<ref>{{Mcnet|new-world-generation-java-available-testing|New world generation in Java available for testing|September 8, 2021|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|pkalqg/minecraft_118_experimental_snapshot_7_is_out||Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot 7 is out!|MrHenrik2|September 8, 2021}}</ref> which introduces changes to terrain generation and tweaks to elytra due to various server chunk loading issues. This is the final experimental snapshot released in 2021.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Elytra]]'''
* No longer take durability damage when gliding, only when boosting with [[firework rocket]]s.
* Decreased the firework rocket boost on an elytra from 30 blocks per second to 26 blocks per second.
* Now break when the item reaches 0 durability.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Noodle caves are no longer capped at Y=130, allowing cave openings and cracks in mountain peaks.

'''General'''
* Slightly smoothened the terrain by lowering the noise.</onlyinclude>
