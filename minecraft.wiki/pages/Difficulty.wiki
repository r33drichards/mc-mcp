'''Difficulty''' is an [[option]] in ''[[Minecraft]]'' that has a direct impact on the ease of [[gameplay]], allowing the game's challenges to be tailored to the [[player]]'s skill level.

== World settings ==
[[File:DifficultyButton.gif|thumb|right|The difficulty button {{in|je}}.]]
[[File:Difficulty.png|thumb|260px|The options menu available in the [[pause menu]] {{in|je}}, with the difficulty button highlighted.]]
There are four difficulty levels in the game: Peaceful, Easy, Normal, and Hard. These can be changed when creating a world, in the [[world options]], as well as with the {{cmd|difficulty}} command.

While the difficulty settings modify the challenge in [[Survival]] mode, they also affect hostile mobs in [[Creative]] mode the same as in Survival; for example:

* Most hostile mobs cannot spawn naturally in Creative Peaceful.
* [[Zombie]]s have the same difficulty-dependent chances as in Survival to convert villagers into [[zombie villager]]s (0% in Creative Easy, 50% in Creative Normal, 100% in Creative Hard).
* Hostile mobs killed by [[Tutorial:Mob grinder|mob grinders]] in farms drop higher-value items in Creative Hard.

[[Survival]] mode is affected by difficulty as described in the sections below. 

=== Peaceful ===
No [[hostile mob]]s can spawn naturally, except for [[shulker]]s, [[hoglin]]s, and the [[ender dragon]], all of whom no longer deal any damage. No [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, [[endermen]], [[drowned]], [[skeleton horse]]s, [[zombie horse]]s, or [[camel husk]]s – [[Mob#Neutral mobs|neutral]]/[[Mob#Passive mobs|passive]] rather than hostile mobs – can spawn naturally. {{IN|java}}, [[piglin]]s and [[hoglin]]s can only naturally spawn inside of [[bastion remnants]], and their other spawning conditions are disabled, same goes for [[zombie nautilus]]es, only spawning inside of [[ocean ruin]]s. 

When any of these mobs attempt to spawn (whether naturally, through [[monster spawner]]s, [[spawn egg]]s, or [[commands]]), they despawn instantaneously, with no visible spawning.

All mobs that can spawn (such as shulkers, piglins, zombie nautiluses, [[polar bear]]s, or [[wolves]]) are completely peaceful and unable to harm the player, with the exception of the ender dragon. Additionally, [[sculk shrieker]]s do not give the [[Darkness]] effect because they can't spawn the [[warden]].

When the difficulty is switched from any other setting to Peaceful, all mobs that are not allowed to spawn on Peaceful despawn. Players regain [[health]] rapidly over time. Despite this, it is still possible to [[die]] if damage is received quickly enough. [[TNT]] deals no direct damage to the player, but it does give knockback still, meaning a player can be killed by it if it launches them too far upward.

{{IN|Java}}, due to a bug, ocelots can't spawn naturally on Peaceful, as they occupy the monster [[mob cap]].<ref name="hostile kitty">{{bug|MC-1788||Ocelots do not spawn naturally on peaceful difficulty in jungle and bamboo jungle biomes}}</ref>

The [[hunger bar]] never depletes; {{in|je}}, players therefore cannot eat anything except [[golden apple]]s, [[chorus fruit]]s, [[milk bucket]]s, [[honey bottle]]s, and [[suspicious stew]], unless the player switched to Peaceful when their hunger bar was below the maximum. Players can eat normally {{in|be}}. Additionally, if the hunger bar is below the maximum, it regenerates quickly.

The [[monster]]s that spawn naturally, which are [[ender dragon]]s, [[hoglin]]s, [[piglin]]s, [[shulker]]s and [[zombie nautilus]]es, become harmless on Peaceful. [[Killer bunnies]]{{only|java|short=1}} become passive as well.

If a player is in a village with [[Raid Omen]] and the effect ends, the [[raid]] is not triggered as raiders cannot spawn in peaceful difficulty.

Because of the gameplay changes and the absence of many mob types, many blocks and items are unavailable to the player. A list can be found at [[Non-renewable resource#Peaceful difficulty]]. In addition, the player is unable to get many [[advancement]]s and [[achievement]]s. 

[[Dispenser]]s are unable to place [[wither skeleton skull]]s even if the required blocks for summoning a [[wither]] are available.

One major effect of the lack of certain resources is that [[End portal]]s cannot be activated by the player in Peaceful difficulty, because it is impossible to acquire the [[eyes of ender]] necessary to activate an end portal.<ref group="note"> An eye of ender requires [[blaze powder]] to craft, which can be crafted only from [[blaze rod]]s; but a blaze rod can be obtained only as a drop from a [[blaze]], which is a hostile mob that cannot spawn in Peaceful.</ref> However, it is possible to switch to a non-Peaceful difficulty, let blazes spawn, kill enough for crafting eyes of ender, and switch back to Peaceful. It is also possible for an end portal to be activated by naturally generating with an eye of ender already embedded within all 12 end portal frames. For any given end portal, there is a 1 in a trillion chance of this happening.<ref group=note>Since each end portal frame has a {{fraction|1|10}} chance of being filled, there is a ({{fraction|1|10}})<sup>12</sup> = {{fraction|1|1 trillion}} chance of all 12 end portal frames being filled.</ref>
However, because of the huge number of possible seeds, over 8 million seeds are known to generate such end portals.<ref>https://github.com/hube12/SSGOutput/releases/tag/1.1</ref>

=== Easy ===
Hostile [[mob]]s spawn, but they deal {{frac|1|2}} of the damage they would on Normal difficulty plus {{hp|1}} or the same damage they would on Normal difficulty, whichever is lower. The hunger bar can deplete, damaging the player until {{hp|10}} remain if it drains completely. [[Cave spider]]s and [[bee]]s cannot poison players on Easy difficulty, and the [[wither]] does not cause the [[Wither (effect)|Wither effect]], although [[wither skeleton]]s do. [[Lightning]] sets only the struck block on fire, not surrounding blocks. [[Zombie]]s do not break down doors, and do not turn [[villager]]s into [[zombie villager]]s. [[Zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s do not wear full sets of armor. Hostile [[mob]]s like zombies, skeletons, [[spider]]s, [[husk]]s, and [[stray]]s deal about {{hp|1}} or {{hp|2}} damage.

If a player is in a village with [[Raid Omen]] and the effect ends, it triggers a raid that consists of 3 waves (4 waves if a player with a Raid Omen effect that is higher than one level enters a village.)

=== Normal ===
Hostile [[mob]]s spawn and deal standard damage. The hunger bar can deplete, damaging the player until {{hp|1}} remains if it drains completely. Zombies do not break down doors, but villagers killed by zombies have a 50% chance of turning into [[zombie villager]]s. Zombies and skeletons rarely wear sets of enchanted armor. [[Vindicator]]s can break doors.

If a player is in a village with [[Raid Omen]] and the effect ends, it triggers a raid that consists of 5 waves (6 waves if a player with a Raid Omen effect that is higher than one level enters a village.)

=== Hard ===
{{redirect|Hard|the property of blocks|Hardness}}
Hostile [[mob]]s deal approximately 1{{frac|1|2}} times the damage they would deal on Normal difficulty, and in some cases drop higher-value items when killed. The hunger bar can deplete, not only damaging but also killing the player if it drains completely. [[Zombie]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s{{only|je|short=1}} can break through wooden and copper [[door]]s and can spawn [[Zombie#Reinforcements|reinforcement]]s when attacked. {{IN|Java}}, [[spider]]s can spawn with a beneficial status effect ([[Speed]], [[Strength]], [[Regeneration]], or [[Invisibility]]), with these effects having an infinite duration. Villagers killed by zombies always turn into zombie villagers. {{IN|Bedrock}}, if the world type isn't infinite, [[pillager]]s deal {{hp|4}} damage, instead of {{hp|5}}.

If a player is in a village with [[Raid Omen]] and the effect ends, it triggers a raid that consists of 7 waves (8 waves if a player with a Raid Omen effect that is higher than one level enters a village.)

=== Hardcore mode ===
<gallery widths="90px" heights="90px" style="float: right;">
Hardcore Heart.svg|Icon for Hardcore mode.
</gallery>
{{main|Hardcore}}

While in the world creation screen, selecting '''Hardcore''' from among the [[game mode]] options causes the player to spawn in Hard difficulty, does not allow it to be changed, and allows the player only one life. In a single player world, a player who dies can choose to respawn in [[Spectator]] mode or return to the title screen. In multiplayer, upon death, the player's game mode is automatically set to Spectator mode.

{{IN|java}}, the only way to change the difficulty of Hardcore is to use the ''Open to LAN'' feature in the pause menu to enable commands, or to use an .NBT editor on the world's .NBT file.

== Moon phase ==
The phase of the [[moon]] has effects on the spawning of [[slime]]s in [[swamp]] biomes, and contributes to the calculation of regional difficulty. The fuller the moon is, the greater the effect.

The moon does not actually have to be in the sky for this effect to take place, since the moon exists in daytime and across [[dimension]]s.

== Regional difficulty ==
[[File:Local Difficulty Debug.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Regional difficulty values shown on the [[debug screen]]]] 

'''Regional difficulty''' or '''local difficulty''' is a value between 0.00 and 6.75 that the game calculates by considering the world difficulty setting, the ''inhabited time'' of a [[chunk]], the ''total daytime'' in the world, and the phase of the [[moon]]. This value is shown on the [[debug screen]] as the ''first'' value listed after the heading "Local Difficulty". This value determines several aspects of the difficulty of gameplay (see [[#Other effects|below]]).

The ''inhabited time'' of a chunk increases for each tick a player spends with the chunk loaded. This is a cumulative measure of time—if 50 players spend a single hour in a chunk, it counts the same as if one player spent 50 hours there. The effect of inhabited time on regional difficulty is capped at 50 hours.

The ''total daytime'' in the world is the value from {{cmd|time query daytime}} added to the "Day" on the F3 debug screen converted to ticks, i.e. <code>daytime + (dayNumber * 24,000)</code>. This is ''not'' the same as the actual playtime in the world (the value from {{cmd|time query gametime}}). It affects the regional difficulty after the first 3 in-game days, and has no additional effect after 63 in-game days.

In pseudocode, the calculation of regional difficulty is:

 # DaytimeFactor, ChunkFactor, and RegionalDifficulty are floating-point variables
 # MoonPhase is as in the table above.
 
 if (difficulty is Peaceful) return 0
 
 if (TotalDaytime > 63 in-game days) DaytimeFactor = 0.25
 else if (TotalDaytime < 3 in-game days) DaytimeFactor = 0 
 else DaytimeFactor = (TotalDaytimeInTicks &minus; 72,000) / 5,760,000
 
 if (ChunkInhabitedTime > 50 hours) ChunkFactor = 1
 else ChunkFactor = ChunkInhabitedTimeInTicks / 3,600,000
 
 if (difficulty is Normal or Easy) multiply ChunkFactor by 0.75
 
 if (MoonPhase ÷ 4 > DaytimeFactor) add DaytimeFactor to ChunkFactor
 else add (MoonPhase ÷ 4) to ChunkFactor
 
 if (difficulty is Easy) multiply ChunkFactor by 0.5
 
 RegionalDifficulty = 0.75 + DaytimeFactor + ChunkFactor
 
 if (difficulty is Normal) multiply RegionalDifficulty by 2
 if (difficulty is Hard) multiply RegionalDifficulty by 3
 
 return RegionalDifficulty

The raw regional difficulty therefore is always 0.0 on Peaceful and ranges from 0.75 to 1.5 on Easy, 1.5 to 4.0 on Normal, and 2.25 to 6.75 on Hard.

=== Clamped regional difficulty ===
[[File:Regional difficulty to Clamped regional difficulty.png|thumb|325px|How ''clamped regional difficulty'' relates to ''regional difficulty'']] 
The '''clamped regional difficulty''' (also known as '''special multiplier''') also is a value between 0.00 and 1.00 based on regional difficulty. This value is shown on the [[debug screen]] as the ''second'' value listed after the heading "Local Difficulty". This is yet ''another'' value that affects the difficulty of gameplay (see [[#Other effects|below]]).

The regional difficulty value is clamped as follows:

 if (RegionalDifficulty < 2.0) value = 0.0;
 else if (RegionalDifficulty > 4.0) value = 1.0;
 else value = (RegionalDifficulty &minus; 2.0) / 2.0;

Thus, on Easy, where regional difficulty is never higher than 1.5, the clamped value is always zero. On Normal, where regional difficulty is between 1.5 and 4.0, the clamped value can be anywhere from 0.0 to 1.0. On Hard, where the regional difficulty is never lower than 2.25, the clamped value is always at least 0.125.

On Normal, the effects reach the maximum after {{convert|63|in-game day|game tick}} in a fully-inhabited chunk on a full moon; and on Hard after 63 in-game days the effects reach the maximum in chunks inhabited {{frac|4|1|6}} hours during a full moon and remain at maximum in chunks inhabited over {{frac|16|2|3}} hours.{{verify|is this paragraph talking about clamped or nonclamped?|type=current}}

|{{HistoryLine||May 21, 2009|link=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg203084#msg203084|Difficulty modes were mentioned including: "Walk in the Park" being the easiest, "Easy" which was added, and "Armageddon" being hard even with 32 people.}}
|{{HistoryLine||June 14, 2009|link={{tumblr|notch|123343045}}|[[Markus Persson|Notch]] discussed how his vision for [[Survival]] mode would incorporate the concept of difficulty: "When generating a new level or loading a creative mode level, you also select a difficulty. Difficulty levels will probably vary from 'challenging' to 'impossible', since I want the game to be difficult. If it's not fun to always be challenged, I'll add easier difficulties."}}
