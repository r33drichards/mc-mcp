== Trivia ==
* Before the heart of the sea was added to {{BE}}, there was an entry found in the buried treasure chest loot table named <code>nautilus_core</code>, which was later revealed to be the heart of the sea. Despite the name change, the heart of the sea continues to be referred to as the <code>nautilus_core</code> in most game files.
