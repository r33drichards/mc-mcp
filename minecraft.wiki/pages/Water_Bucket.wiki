A '''water bucket''' is a [[bucket]] filled with [[water]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Interacting ===
To fill an empty [[bucket]] with water, {{control|use}} it on a [[water]] source block. The water is consumed in the process. Flowing water does not fill a bucket.

{{control|Using}} an empty bucket on a [[cauldron]] filled with water (water level 3) empties the cauldron and fills the bucket.

Water buckets can also be filled by placing an empty one in the fuel slot of a [[furnace]], and a wet [[sponge]] into the oven slot. The bucket is filled when the [[smelting]] process completes, which also leaves the sponge dry and ready to be reused.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|water-bucket}}

=== Smelting ===
If an empty bucket is in the fuel slot of a [[furnace]]  when a [[wet sponge]] finishes [[smelting]] and becomes a dry sponge, the bucket fills with water. Other fuel items have to be used to smelt the wet sponge before the empty bucket is inserted. If a [[lava bucket]] is used as the fuel, it fills with water when the sponge dries out, meaning an empty bucket does not need to be inserted separately.

== Usage ==
{{Control|Using}} a water bucket on a solid block places a water source block against that block, emptying the bucket; using a water bucket on a [[waterlogging|waterloggable]] block waterlogs the block. In [[the Nether]], however, the water evaporates, making a fire extinguishing sound and displays smoke particles while nothing gets placed.

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can be loaded with a water bucket, and when activated it places a water block directly before it, emptying the bucket. A dispenser loaded with an empty bucket and a water source right in front of it draws the source into the bucket when activated.

=== Cauldrons ===
A single water bucket can fill a [[cauldron]], and using an empty bucket on a water-filled cauldron fills the bucket. Empty buckets cannot be filled from partly-filled cauldrons.

=== Filling bucket with mobs ===
Water buckets can be used on a [[fish]], [[axolotl]] or [[tadpole]] to create a [[bucket of aquatic mob]].

=== Transportation ===
{{main|Tutorial:Elevators#Water elevators}}
Water buckets can be used as a means of quickly descending great heights in the [[Overworld]] and [[the End]], either by creating a waterfall or using the water bucket while falling to create a safe water landing.

Water buckets can also be used to climb vertical surfaces anywhere but [[the Nether]] by repeatedly creating higher waterfalls from the bottom and swimming up them.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s have a {{frac|1|3}} chance of purchasing 1 water bucket for 2 [[emerald]]s.
