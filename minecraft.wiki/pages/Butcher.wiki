A '''butcher''' is a [[villager]] that [[trade]]s [[meat]]s and some other food items. Butchers wear a red headband and have a white apron.

== Spawning ==
An unemployed [[villager]] turns into a butcher when an unclaimed [[smoker]] is nearby.

=== Natural generation ===
The workstation of butchers, the [[smoker]], generates in butcher shops in [[villages]].

== Drops ==
{{IN|java}}, a butcher can drop various items by throwing them as a gift towards a nearby player with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect. The gift is randomly selected from the following list:
*{{ItemLink|Cooked Chicken}}
*{{ItemLink|Cooked Mutton}}
*{{ItemLink|Cooked Porkchop}}
*{{ItemLink|Cooked Rabbit}}
*{{ItemLink|Steak}}
