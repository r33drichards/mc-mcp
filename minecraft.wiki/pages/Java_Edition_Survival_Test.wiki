'''Survival Test''' was a test for the [[Survival]] game mode, initially released to premium members<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20090904213840/http://www.minecraft.net/survivaltest</ref> during the [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] phase of development, being accessible at [http://www.minecraft.net/survivaltest minecraft.net/survivaltest], and refers to 11 versions released between September 1 and October 24, 2009.

On October 24, 2009,{{cn}} Survival Test was opened to be played regardless of premium membership. 

Survival Test was removed from the website on December 16, 2010, when the site received a major overhaul. Survival Test is not available in the [[launcher]], though it can be played if the user is able to provide the <code>.jar</code> file.

; [[Mob]]s
: Added [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[creeper]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[spider]]s.
: [[Creeper]]s in this version had a melee attack where they jumped into the player and would only explode upon death.
: [[Skeleton]]'s arrows were [[Java_Edition_unused_features#Purple_arrow|purple]], and when killed blew up in an explosion of six to nine arrows that the player could pick up, increasing the total amount of arrows the player has. They also shot arrows from their bare hands as bows did not exist in the Survival Test. Skeletons shot their arrows at a much faster rate than in current versions, making them one of, if not the most dangerous mob in the Survival Test.
; [[Health]]
: The player has a health bar, which has 10 hearts ({{Hp|20|notag=1}}). When the player has 2 hearts or less, the health bar begins to shake.
: Players and mobs can take damage from various sources: falling, drowning, [[lava]], hostile mobs, and the player's [[arrow]]s.
: [[Brown mushroom]]s can be eaten by right-clicking while holding it, healing {{hp|5}} points of health. They are dropped by pigs and sheep. [[Red mushroom]]s are poisonous, and deal {{hp|3}} damage to the [[player]].
: When the player dies, the world is no longer playable, like in [[Hardcore]] mode before Spectator mode was introduced.
; General
: The player can fire arrows by pressing "tab". However, the player only spawns with 20 arrows upon generating a new world.
: After 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST, the player starts with 10 [[TNT]] in their ninth [[hotbar]] slot, which can be placed with right-click and detonated with left-click. Exploding TNT deals a maximum of six hearts of damage (depending on how close the player is to it) and has a blast radius of about four blocks.

== Points ==
Some aspects of the [[Score|point system]] are listed below:
* [[Pig]]s awarded 10 points.
* [[Sheep]] awarded 10 points.
* [[Zombie]]s awarded 80 points. (formerly 100)
* [[Spider]]s awarded 105 points. (formerly 10)
* [[Skeleton]]s awarded 120 points. (formerly 100)
* [[Creeper]]s awarded 200 points (formerly 250).
Points would not be awarded for indirect kills (e.g. a creeper's explosion killing a zombie didn't award points for killing the zombie).

== Blocks ==
A handful of blocks are obtained in different ways than in the modern game:
* [[Gold block]]s were obtained by mining [[gold ore]].
* [[Iron block]]s were obtained by mining [[iron ore]].
* Stone [[slab]]s were obtained by mining [[coal ore]].
* [[Oak wood planks]] were obtained by chopping up oak [[log]]s.

All blocks in the Survival Test could stack up to 99. 

All other blocks found naturally in the world could be picked up normally, with the exception of ores and logs, which drop their resources, [[stone]] which drops [[cobblestone]] as normal, [[leaves]] which also drop [[sapling]]s as normal, [[grass block]]s which drop [[dirt]] (which can handle grass again) and [[fluid]]s and [[bedrock]] which are unbreakable.

== Trivia ==
* Survival Test was going to be the original "beta" phase of the game, with "release" being when survival was finalized.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009/DBN-IRC-Logs/ IRC logs] on Archive.org; #minecraft.20090711.log. July 11, 2009 (UTC&minus;5). "''A9:27:00 <08Notch> beta = when survival mode works "ok"''", "''A9:27:06 <08Notch> release = when survival mode is done''" (14:27 UTC)</ref> This was changed by Indev as Notch realized the game would have a much longer development cycle.
* In Survival Test, [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s had a chance of wearing decorative plate armor, but Notch removed it in Indev. This feature was re-added in a similar fashion in [[Java Edition 1.4.2]].
* In Survival Test, the fastest mob was the [[spider]], being able to move as fast as the player.
* In [[Classic 0.24 SURVIVAL TEST|0.24]], [[creeper]]s were made from the failed [[pig]] model.
* In Survival Test, the player's hand is pointed backwards and is rotated slightly. This was changed in Indev and remains the same.
* [[Stone]] materials are not damaged by [[TNT]].
* In this version, [[creeper]]s had melee attacks and only exploded when killed. The only food source was mushrooms, and you could get them by killing pigs and sheep or finding them in caves. The [[Score|point system]] was first implemented in this update. The player's fist also took {{hp|4}} away from the mob the player punched.
* If the player pressed the "F5" key on their keyboard, it would toggle a rainy weather effect.
