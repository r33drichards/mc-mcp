{{Disambiguation}}
In the previous versions of {{BE}}, there were several blocks that had the "'''update!'''" text on their textures:
* {{BlockLink|info_update|text={{samp|info_update}}}}
** {{BlockLink|info_update2|text={{samp|info_update2}}}}
* {{BlockLink|unknown|id=info_update|text={{samp|unknown}}}}
* {{BlockLink|reserved6|text={{samp|reserved6}}}}
* {{BlockLink|Client request placeholder block|id=air|text={{samp|client_request_placeholder_block}}}}
