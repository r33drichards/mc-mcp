The term '''Aquatic''' refers to an in-game group of [[mob]]s that live in [[ocean]]s and [[river]]s and are able to swim.

== Properties ==
Aquatic mobs obligatorily share the property of being in the {{cd|aquatic}} [[entity tag]] on {{JE}}. {{IN|JE}}, this also causes them to take extra damage from the [[Impaling]] enchantment.

Some or most aquatic mobs may also take suffocation damage when on land, not cause [[pufferfish]] to puff, and not take drowning damage, although this doesn't affect their classification.
