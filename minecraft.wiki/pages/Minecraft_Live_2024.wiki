'''Minecraft Live 2024''' was a livestreamed, pre-recorded event that was held on September 28, 2024 at 17:00 UTC that revealed new ''[[Minecraft]]'' features and other news.<ref name="recap">{{mcnet|minecraft-live-2024-the-recap|Minecraft LIVE 2024: The recap!|September 28, 2024|Owen Jones}}</ref> This was the first [[Minecraft Live]] event{{note|Including the ''Minecraft Live'' predecessors ''MINECON Earth'' and ''MINECON Live''}} to have no [[Community Vote|community vote]].

== News ==

Minecraft Live 2024 revealed the [[Pale Garden|pale garden]] biome, the [[creaking]] mob, and the [[Bundles of Bravery]] drop for ''[[Minecraft]]'', which includes [[bundle]]s for both editions and [[Hardcore]] mode on ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''. It also revealed more information about ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'' and [[Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue]].<ref name="recap"/>

On September 24, the show's [[minecraft.net]] page was accidentally switched to the version supposed to be shown after the livestream for a few hours, leaking the content of the show.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20240924180401/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/live</ref>

== Summary ==
{{Incomplete section|the remaining chapters of the stream}}

=== Intro ===
The stream opens on an animated intro sequence of several mobs dancing, beginning with an [[armadillo]] floating in [[water]] while a [[frog]] sits on its shell, and then jumps off before trying to eat a [[chicken]]. The chicken walks onto an [[enderman]]'s head, which then teleports over to a [[llama]], which spits on the enderman. The llama watches as the enderman teleports away, and is then knocked back by a [[goat]] into a pool below the show's logo.

The video segues to Mojang's headquarters, where [[Lydia Winters]] welcomes the viewer to the show. A montage of the interior follows, showing several unique fixtures and areas, such as the front lobby, a statue of the anatomy of a [[creeper]], a mural in the cafeteria, and a statue of the [[Earth:Muddy Pig|muddy pig]]. As Lydia promises news on content, she thanks the community for their dedication. She reminisces about the Official Minecraft Trailer, pointing out that it was created by a fan, Vareide.

After a replay of the trailer finishes, [[Jens Bergensten]] appears. He lists off important events of the year, such as the [[Trial Chamber Legends|Summer Celebration]] and [[Ender Cup]]. He then starts to reminisce himself, thinking back to his early days as a programmer when Mojang had a far smaller office. He begins to lecture about the growing scope of the ''Minecraft'' universe, explaining that many interpretations of the lore have been made, and many more will follow, thanks to the players' own imagination. Several examples are given, such as ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' and ''[[Minecraft Legends]]'', before recounting his experiences working on ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]''. As he remembers, he traveled all the way to {{Wikipedia|New Zealand}} and was amazed to see the game's world brought to life on set.

Jens proceeds to explain the change in development, addressing the new practice of [[game drops]] over a "yearly summer update." Citing the [[Armored Paws]] drop as precedent, he promises to release content more regularly and on a less strict schedule. Suddenly, a [[bee]] flies into the screen, followed by another montage, this time showing various Mojang staff members working on the game. One employee carries a laptop, while another uses a laptop. Someone taps a copy machine again and again, while someone eats in the cafeteria. Someone is handed a cup of coffee, and then sips from it. The employee using the copier then taps the sides of the machine, annoyed. A [[Splash Potion|splash potion]] emerges from the bottom of the screen.

=== Bundles of Bravery ===
[[Agnes Larsson]] welcomes viewers to the segment, and announces they will be working on two drops in the coming months. Their first, [[Bundles of Bravery]], focuses on adding [[bundle]]s, and adding [[Hardcore|hardcore mode]] to ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''. [[Stephen Scott]] appears to elaborate on the feature, equating hardcore to the [[First Night]]. He then explains that there's a special toggle on the [[Create New World]] screen to play hardcore, and notes he likes the detail of a border on the world icon. From there he explains some of the challenges found in hardcore mode, such as breaking routines and being unable to make many mistakes.

The segment transitions to explain bundles, with [[Matthew Gatland]] hosting and narrating over footage of [[Kai]] using bundles. He gives the example of early builds having a strip mine fill the player's [[inventory]] with [[cobblestone]], as opposed to newer builds having a bigger variety that clog the inventory. From there he explains that they watched various streams of [[survival]] gameplay, and took pictures of their inventories to use as data. He then shows off some other features, such as [[dyeing]] and being used to share items. However, the stream is soon cut off by static, transitioning into ''[[Villager News]]''.

===''A Minecraft Movie''===
As the feed returns "back to Minecraft Live," another montage inside of Mojang Studios is shown, before ending on a flock of [[parrot]]s swarming around as [[Vu Bui]] appears. He reminisces about how long it's taken to develop ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', and thanks the staff involved for their hard work, transitioning into a behind-the-scenes look at the film presented by producer Torfi Frans Olafsson and director {{w|Jared Hess}}. They affirm that the film had been in development for over a decade, finally coming down to New Zealand to film and showing many of the props. The choice to use live action is explained as a way to give the film a unique identity compared to other interpretations of the game. They thank the production staff for their commitment to the aesthetic, singling out {{Wikipedia|Grant Major}}.

From there, Jared Hess addresses the name of the film, and explains it's meant to represent the film being a unique take on ''Minecraft''. He introduces characters such as [[Henry]], [[Garrett Garrison|Garrett]], and [[Steve (A Minecraft Movie)|Steve]], describing the former as a representation of individuality and modding, and the latter as a one-of-a-kind take on what Steve could be. [[Jack Black]] is mentioned as being a huge fan of the game, and was ecstatic to bring his interpretation of the character to life, even playing the game between shoots. From there Torfi Frans Olafsson discusses how older versions of the game had a sense of mystery, due to the lack of a [[recipe book]], and explain Garrett's character as a washed up video game champion. This leads into a clip from the movie, in which Steve teaches Henry and Garrett how to use a [[Crafting Table]], to which Garrett attempts to make an [[Iron Sword]] but ends up creating a failed recipe (two [[bucket]]s connected by a [[chain]]).

Once the clip ends, Torfi Frans Olafsson goes into their creative process behind the altered art style, detailing how they started by figuring out how a crafting table should look and settled on using the tools on the side to actually craft the items. From there he explains how they figured out the scale of items and blocks, respecting the original game while ensuring it would be practical for a film. As they show footage of the final day of shooting, Torfi Frans Olafsson and Jared Hess sign off, saying they'll "see [the viewers] in the [[Overworld]]!" followed by the reveal of the film's [[bee]] design.<ref>{{ytl|Xgr9bVmCPHo|Minecraft Live 2024: A MINECRAFT MOVIE {{!}} EXCLUSIVE INSIGHT|Minecraft|September 28, 2024}}</ref> At this point, Vu returns to mention the film is still in production, working closely alongside Mojang to finish the film, and transitions into another montage inside Mojang.

=== ''Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue'' ===
Lydia Winters returns, asking the viewer if they ever wanted to "venture through ''Minecraft'' biomes in real life, introducing ''[[Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue]]''. The stream moves over to [[Olivier]], showing him getting makeup done inside of the experience, and establishes their immediate goal was authenticity to the game. Many different areas within the game are shown, including [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]], [[Bamboo Jungle|bamboo jungle]], [[Ocean Monument|ocean monument]], and [[forest]]. [[Sara]] appears, explaining the story of a [[village]] being attacked by zombies, followed by the show's method of immersion, 17 foot projection walls that can be interacted with using the [[Orb of interaction]]. After listing off various ways to play the game, she highlights immersion, with footage of two players entering a [[Nether portal]], and confirms the attraction will open in several locations after its unveiling in {{Wikipedia|Dallas}}, {{Wikipedia|Texas}}. A clutch of [[chicken]]s are then hatched from thrown [[egg]]s.

== Trivia ==
* A running gag throughout the stream is the use of in-game sound effects used to enhance or jest mundane actions. These include the sounds of a [[chest]] opening while someone opens a miniature refrigerator, sounds of eating playing while a developer has their lunch break, employees swearing in villager mumbles, the sounds of a Nether portal playing while someone leaves a purple tinted room, and a trash can making [[lava]] sounds as if it were burning the disposables.
** The said miniatured fridge featured in the background of the first segment with [[Lydia Winters|Lydia]] and other segments is an old furniture that Mojang conserves from the first office Mojang had back in 2012.<ref>{{Bluesky|jebox.bsky.social|3ll4dwilnas2j|Yep it's the same!|March 24, 2025}}</ref>
* The creeper statue featured prominently in the tour of [[Mojang Studios]] was a prop created originally to decorate the Old Mojang Studios Offices<ref>https://youtu.be/ic6tDZdj4As</ref> but also brought to use on [[MINECON 2012]]<ref>https://youtu.be/H2OcjupVL_k</ref>, it is also a reference to a design of its anatomy originating early into the franchise, appearing in media such as ''Minecraft Dungeons'' and ''[[Minecraft: Mobestiary]]''. The statue was refurbished and restored, now being used to decorate Mojang's office.<ref>{{tweet|Marc_IRL|1828794988567941351|A 12 year old friend has returned to the #MojangOffice! Thanks @MissDeliana for restoring and reinforcing one of our aging mascots!}}</ref>
* This is the second Minecraft Live stream to feature Villager News as, prior to appearing in this stream, [[VILLAGER (and Pillager?) NEWS|another Villager News episode]] was created for [[MINECON Live 2019]] to promote the [[Village & Pillage]] update.
