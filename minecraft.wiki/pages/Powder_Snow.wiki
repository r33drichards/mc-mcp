'''Powder snow'''{{note|Although Mojang has used it in other media, the term '''powdered snow''' is never used in-game.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/20297322879245-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-20-50-20|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.20.50.20|website=[[Minecraft.net]]|date=October 11, 2023}}</ref>}} is a non-solid [[block]] found in [[snowy slopes]] and [[grove]]s, or collected from [[snowfall]] using [[cauldron]]s. It slows down and deals freezing [[damage]] to most [[entities]] within it. Wearing any [[leather armor]] prevents freezing, and worn [[leather boots]] allow powder snow to be walked on and climbed through. It can only be [[Powder Snow Bucket|obtained]] using a [[bucket]] and melts when placed inside [[water]].

== Obtaining ==
Powder snow doesn't have an item form {{in|java}}.

The item form of it can be obtained only by inventory editing or with add-ons {{in|bedrock}}.

=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the process of breaking powder snow.<ref>{{bug|MC-205407||Powder snow isn't mined any faster with shovels}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-104192||Powder snow doesn't break faster with a shovel|WF}}</ref>
{{Breaking row|horizontal=1|Powder Snow|foot=1|drop=0}}
Powder snow drops nothing when it's destroyed.

Powder snow is broken by [[water]] or [[lava]], when shot with a [[Flame]]-enchanted bow or when a burning player touches it.

=== Natural generation ===
Powder snow naturally generates in [[grove]]s and [[snowy slopes]] in [[strip]] formations. Powder snow cannot have a [[snow layer]] placed on it.

Powder snow also generates in the room {{cd|chamber_2}} in [[trial chambers]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{main|Tutorial:Powder snow farming}}

A [[cauldron]] in a snowy [[biome]] under open sky fills with powder snow when it is [[snowing]]. Powder snow can then be picked up from this cauldron with an empty [[bucket]].

==== Bucket ====

Using a [[powder snow bucket]] places powder snow; placed powder snow can be picked up again with an empty bucket. These actions can be automated using a [[dispenser]]. When picked up, breaking particles appear.{{only|je}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-113502||Powder snow does not create particles when collected with a bucket}}</ref>

== Usage ==
[[File:Frozen effect (texture) JE1.png|thumb|The frosty vignette when a player is within powder snow.]]
All entities (except [[rabbit]]s, [[endermite]]s, [[silverfish]], [[shulker]]s, [[vex]]es and [[fox]]es) fall through powder snow and move much slower in it, similar to [[cobweb]]s. Powder snow does not cause [[Damage#Suffocation|suffocation damage]].

Entities wearing [[leather boots]] (including players, mobs, and armor stands) do not fall through powder snow. Leather boots also allow players to use powder snow like [[scaffolding]], descending by sneaking or crouching on the block and jumping while inside of the block. Leather boots do not speed up entities in snow.

All fall damage is negated when falling on top of powder snow, even for entities wearing leather boots. While moving through powder snow, snowflake [[particles]] appear. 

Most walking mobs (except for [[goat]]s) treat powder snow like normal solid blocks while pathfinding, similar to [[trapdoor]]s, allowing them to voluntarily walk into it, and fall through it if possible.<ref>{{bug|MC-243456||Mobs can walk into powder snow and freeze themselves|WAI}}</ref> However, mobs do not attempt to jump up to powder snow, instead treating it as impassable if they cannot find a path to walk over it from neighboring blocks of equal or greater height.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg0Cxn8AVZA</ref> Goats avoid powder snow, although they are not immune to falling through it and taking freezing damage.

If an entity that is on fire touches powder snow, powder snow cools it down as the powder snow melts.

[[Carpet|Carpets]] can also be placed on top of powder snow to prevent entities from falling through.

Being fully inside a block causes a thick [[fog]] effect around the point of view. Players in [[Spectator]] mode can see through powder snow without any fogging effect.

When powder snow is on top of [[grass block]]s, [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]], the blocks below change to a snowy texture, similar to when [[snow]] layers are on top;<ref>{{bug|MC-262799||When placing powdered snow on grass the grass gets the snow block texture|WAI}}</ref> they revert to their default textures when the powder snow is removed. This change can be detected by [[observer]]s.

=== Freezing ===
{{for|the ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' enchantment|MCD:Freezing}}
{{redirect|Frost}}

[[File:HUD recieving the freeze damage.gif|thumb|Freezing hearts when the player is in powder snow.]][[File:HUD recieving the freeze damage hardcore.gif|thumb|Freezing hearts when the player is in [[Hardcore]].]][[File:Skeleton become Stray.gif|thumb|right|Powder snow converting a [[skeleton]] into a [[stray]].]]
When an entity is inside a powder snow block, they begin to freeze and shake, taking [[damage]].

A player submerged in powder snow sees a frosty vignette slowly fade in at the sides of the screen and the FOV slowly decreases. When the vignette is fully shown, the player begins shivering visibly. After seven seconds (140 game ticks), the player's hearts change to a cyan frosty texture ({{healthbar|2|9px|freezing=1}}), and the player begins taking damage at a rate of {{hp|1}} every two seconds (40 game ticks). When an entity dies of freezing damage, a [[death messages|message]] appears, saying ''[entity] froze to death''. If the player leaves the powder snow block, the vignette slowly fades away. A frozen player moves slower than usual until the vignette fully fades away. This is controlled by the "TicksFrozen" data tag, which increases by 1 every tick (to a maximum of 140) for an entity within the powder snow block. It decreases at a rate of 2 per tick after the entity leaves the powder snow block. As such, if the player reenters powder snow while they are still frozen, they resume freezing and start taking freezing damage based on the value of "TicksFrozen". This is currently not a separate effect when used with commands such as {{cmd|effect give freezing}}, and does not have its own unique art, particles, or potion.

Players do not take freezing damage if the [[game rule]] {{cd|freezeDamage}} is set to {{cd|false}}.

Wearing any piece of [[leather armor]] stops the freezing effect and reverses the damage. This applies to entities that can wear armor, such as [[players]], [[zombie]]s and [[horse]]s wearing leather [[horse armor]]. If the leather armor is put on while the entity already has the freezing effect, the effect fades away the same as if the entity exited the powder snow.

[[Snow golem]]s, [[stray]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[creaking]]s, [[wither]]s, and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to freezing damage. Fire-related mobs like [[strider]]s, [[magma cube]]s, and [[blaze]]s take {{hp|5}} every two seconds (40 game ticks) from freezing.

[[Skeleton]]s turn into [[stray]]s instead of taking freezing damage.

=== Preventing fall damage ===
Similar to water, powder snow resets the fall distance of players and mobs falling into it, and can be used to prevent fall damage. It is superior to water in that it can be used in [[the Nether]]. Damage is also negated when falling onto [[carpet]] placed over powder snow.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Despite not being a solid block, powder snow can be pushed and pulled by pistons like most solid blocks. This makes it the only block that can be placed and retrieved by [[dispenser]]s, while also pushable by pistons.
