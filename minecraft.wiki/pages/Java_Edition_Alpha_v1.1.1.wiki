'''Alpha v1.1.1''',<ref name="hg">{{ytl|X0eap0KWn5c|Minecraft 003- Into the Abyss|SuperClassicGaming|September 19, 2010}}</ref> also known as '''Seecret Saturday''',<ref name="seecret"/> is the tenth and the final [[seecret update]], which added [[sneaking]], new [[painting]]s and [[fishing rod]]s. It was released with [[Alpha server 0.2.1|server 0.2.1]] on September 18, 2010,<ref name="seecret">[[wordofnotch:1144331509|Seecret Saturday 1! But I failed Biomes AGAIN!]] – The Word of Notch, September 18, 2010</ref> and is the only Seecret Saturday update; all other nine seecret updates were released on Fridays.

This version included debug code relating to the gamma slider, which would set the display's gamma and contrast values to zero, sometimes resulting in the screen going completely gray.<ref>[[wordofnotch:1145841495|Regarding the Grayscreen issue]] – The Word of Notch, September 19, 2010</ref> This code was removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2|Alpha v1.1.2]], which was released a few hours after v1.1.1.

== Removals ==
'''General'''
* [[Level previewer]].<ref group="note">Due to web.archive.org captions, the level previewer was removed between [https://web.archive.org/web/20100914165709/http://www.minecraft.net:80/infdev/preview.jsp September 14th] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100926140019/http://www.minecraft.net:80/infdev/preview.jsp September 26th]. Alpha v1.1.1 is not the only version that released between these dates, so removal is likely.</ref>

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Infinite [[snowball]] exploit fixed where [[snow block]]s (requiring 4 snowballs) would be crafted then broken, producing 4–6 snowballs back.
** Solid snow blocks now only drop 4 snowballs.
* Fixed [[furnace]]s<ref>{{tweet|notch|24867580505|The idea was to do Biomes, but I failed again! :-\ But the update is out now, with sneaking and fixed furnaces.}}</ref>{{info needed|too vague - should be listed furnace bugs what fixed in this version}}</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* Despite this version being available for approximately 3 hours and 25 minutes, considerably longer than many other archived versions such as the reupload of [[Alpha 1.2.3_01]] (which was available for 2 minutes), there were no known archives of it until June 25, 2021 (10 years and 9 months after the update's initial release) when X (formerly Twitter) user LunaSorcery provided an archived jar file.<ref>{{cite|url=https://kotaku.com/minecraft-alpha-1-1-1-an-extremely-rare-version-was-f-1847179654|title=Minecraft Alpha 1.1.1, An Extremely Rare Version, Was Finally Found After 10+ Years Of Searching|website=Kotaku|date=June 26, 2021|author=Zack Zwiezen}}</ref>
* There was a bug with crouching that caused the outer layer of custom skins render as if the player wasn't crouching.
* This version is identical to [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2|Alpha v1.1.2]], with the exception of the gamma slider debug code, which caused the infamous "gray screen bug".
* Contrary to popular belief, calm4.ogg does not exist in this version's files.
