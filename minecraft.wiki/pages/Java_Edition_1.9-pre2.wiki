== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Mob spawning]]'''
* [[Pack spawning]] is less likely to spawn the full pack, and less likely to spread them out.
** Previously, spawning a pack would start from the center three times and cumulatively adjust the coordinates four times by up to ±5 in X and Z, trying to spawn a mob each time, for a total of twelve spawn attempts (although it stops early if a full pack has spawned). Now that "four times" is a random number 1–4, meaning fewer total spawn attempts and less chance for the attempt coordinates to get far from the pack center.
