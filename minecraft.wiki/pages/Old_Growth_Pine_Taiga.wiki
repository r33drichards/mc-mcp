'''Old growth pine taigas''' or '''mega taigas''' are forested [[biomes]] covered with both large 2×2 and normal-sized [[spruce tree]]s, with the tall trees being mostly arrow shaped with few leaves at the top.

== Description ==
As the name implies, an old growth pine taiga includes trees that have attained a great age, and therefore great height. 

Pine grows all over the landscape, and most of them are the large 2×2 trees that grow significantly taller than regular trees. Much of the [[grass block]]s are replaced by large swaths of [[podzol]] and [[coarse dirt]]. Additionally, [[Forest rock|rocks]] made of [[mossy cobblestone]] frequently generate on the ground and [[dead bush]]es generate alongside the [[sweet berry bush]]es, [[fern]]s, [[large fern]]s, and [[short grass]] on the ground. [[Mushroom]]s are more common here than most [[Overworld]] biomes. [[Trail ruins]] may generate here. Black [[wolves]], [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s{{only|java|short=1}} may spawn here. As the climate here is cold, [[rain]]fall changes to [[snowfall]] above layer Y=200±8.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], old growth pine taigas use a coolish humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which slightly fades the distance in an orange tint. Old growth pine taigas have default atmospherics and lighting similar to temperate biomes, but coolish color grading tints the environment with a colder blue color.

There are overall more trees in old growth pine taigas compared to normal taigas, leading to increased foliage density. This makes wood more abundant, though as a large portion of it grows as part of tall 2×2 spruce trees, it may be more difficult to obtain. Old growth pine taigas are slightly more difficult for survival than regular taigas for this reason, though aren't so bad once acclimated and strategies are used to clear the tall trees; they may offer more unique views compared to regular taigas as well.

Old growth pine taigas generate at moderately low temperature, very high [[humidity]] and positive weirdness. They border [[grove]]s, normal [[taiga]]s, [[dark forest]]s, [[windswept forest]]s, and [[swamp]]s. Old growth pine taigas can also border [[snowy taiga]]s, [[meadow]]s, and [[pale garden]]s at the tops of a plateau. At higher elevations they transition to [[grove]]s and [[frozen peaks]]. Due to their very high humidity values, old growth pine taigas are almost guaranteed to have [[lush caves]] generate beneath them, however, if the old growth pine taiga generated far inland, [[dripstone caves]] may generate under the old growth taiga instead. They are often separated by [[river]]s from [[old growth spruce taiga]]s. In coastal areas they border [[cold ocean]]s.

==Issues==

== Trivia ==
*The name “Old Growth Pine Taiga” may be misleading and is inaccurate as there are no pine trees in the game and they have spruce trees; there are currently no plans to add pines to the game. This is similar to [[Flint and Steel]], as there is a lack of steel in the game and it is crafted with [[Iron]]. In real life, Iron can’t be used as a fire striker, so they had to use steel so it makes more sense.
