'''Helmet of Champion''' is an unique variant of [[golden helmet]], trimmed with five [[diamond]]s. It appears in the episode "[[The First Night]]" in the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]''.

== Appearance ==
The Helmet of Champion looks like a normal gold helmet, but is decorated with diamonds of various shapes on all sides.

== Properties ==
The Helmet of Champion is used as a head ornament, similar to the [[Crown]] and as a means of head protection, however the Helmet of Champion is likely to have the same durability as its unadorned counterpart.

== Biography ==
The Helmets of Champion, two in number, were apparently created before the series began. They were intended to be a reward for the team that passed all the challenges and won the show. When [[Durango]] and [[River (Character)|River]] pass the first challenge, [[Zed]] shows them the helmets, and [[CommuniKate]] says that they are a reward for the winning team. Later, when teams teleported to the [[Greek Islands]], Zed, standing next to CommuniKate, puts on helmet.
