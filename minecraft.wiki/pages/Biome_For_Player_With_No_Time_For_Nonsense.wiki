'''Biome For Player With No Time For Nonsense''' is a joke [[biome]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]]. It generates in the <code>busy</code> dimension.

== Description ==
The biome resembles a [[snowy taiga]], although [[Block of Mineral|mineral blocks]] and [[redstone components]] generate instead of ores. These blocks also spawn a lot more frequently{{needs testing|how frequent?}}. Unlike in normal snowy taigas, no [[igloo]]s or [[mob]]s spawn here, but [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[stronghold]]s, caves and ravines generate normally. Biome generates exactly the same in the <code>busy</code> dimension as in a [[Buffet]] world. 

Due to large amounts of [[block entities]] in this biome, it will most likely cause performance issues.

== List of ores ==
This biome generates redstone components and mineral blocks where ores would normally generate. Like ores, these blocks generate in blobs. All of these blocks generate at below Y = 128.
