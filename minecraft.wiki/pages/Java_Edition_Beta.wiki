'''Beta''' was the sixth and the final [[Java Edition#Development|development phase]] that succeeded [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] and preceded the [[Java Edition#full release|full release of ''Java Edition'']], and was the fifth and final Minecraft development stage to have some of its versions released to the public. It was announced on [[Notch]]'s blog on December 11, 2010, and released nine days later on December 20, 2010.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210813083726/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/2175441966/minecraft-beta-december-20-2010|title=Minecraft Beta: December 20, 2010|website=The Word of Notch|date=December 11, 2010}}</ref> As well as some minor updates, the transition from Alpha saw a 50% price increase (therefore making the cost 25% of the full price), a change in the disclaimer (Notch removed the line that said "all future updates will be provided free of charge", though the statement still applies to users who bought ''Minecraft'' before Beta was released. Both Alpha and Beta buyers got the full game free of charge) and minor updates to the main website.

== Trivia ==
* Some sound effects in Beta no longer play the old sound effect, instead they play the newer sounds because sounds are not stored in the [[minecraft.jar]] file.
* The first version of ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'' and ''[[MinecraftEdu]]'' was based off of {{vl|JE Beta 1.6.6|}}.
