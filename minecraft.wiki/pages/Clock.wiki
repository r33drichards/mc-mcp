A '''clock''' is an [[item]] that shows the state of the [[daylight cycle]] in the Overworld. It spins randomly in dimensions that do not have daylight cycles.

[[File:WatchCycle.gif|class=pixel-image drop-shadow-dark|right|120px|Clock animation]]
The clock dial consists of two halves, a day side and a night side. The dial spins clockwise slowly to indicate the time of day, corresponding to the sun or moon's actual position in the sky. When the time of day changes suddenly, such as after sleeping or when {{cmd|time}} is used, the clock dial spins rapidly to catch up. The player is able to [[sleep]] a few seconds after the clock shows exactly dusk.

The dial always shows the current in-game time when in the [[Overworld]], regardless of where it appears. This includes a player's hand, an inventory slot, a [[crafting grid]], an [[item frame]], or even as a dropped [[Item (entity)|item]]. For a clock to be mounted on a wall, an item frame is required.

Because there is no day–night cycle in [[the Nether]] or [[the End]], clocks do not work properly in these dimensions. Instead, the dial rotates rapidly and randomly. Although clocks do not function in these dimensions, the actual daylight cycle does continue.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s run toward any clock item on the ground and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory.

== Trivia == 
* {{IN|java}}, the default resource pack for the clock contains 64 individual frames, each frame lasting about 18.75 seconds in real time (375 ticks) (1350 seconds (22 minutes, 30 seconds) in Minecraft time).
