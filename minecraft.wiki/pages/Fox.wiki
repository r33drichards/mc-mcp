A '''fox''' is a [[neutral mob]] found in [[taiga]]s and similar [[biome]]s. It hunts small [[animal]]s, can carry [[item]]s in its mouth and will eat anything that is [[edible]]. A fox will trust and defend a [[player]] that spawned it through [[breeding]], but will run away from non-{{Control|sneaking}} players in any other circumstance.

== Spawning ==
Foxes spawn in groups of two to four, and can spawn on [[grass block]]s, [[coarse dirt]], [[podzol]], [[snow block]]s, and [[snow]]. {{IN|be}}, they can spawn on any block. 5% of them spawn as babies.

Foxes have two color variants, red and snow, which depend on the [[biome]] they spawn in. Red foxes spawn in [[taiga]]s, [[old growth pine taiga]]s, and [[old growth spruce taiga]]s, while snow foxes spawn in [[grove]]s and [[snowy taiga]]s.

When [[bred]], the color of the baby fox that is spawned depends on the color of its parents, regardless of the biome it is born in.

{{Mob spawn table|Snow Fox}}

=== Holding items ===
Foxes have a 20% chance to spawn (via [[spawn egg]] or naturally) with one of the following items in their mouth:
{| class="wikitable sortable col-1-left col-2-center col-3-center"
|+
! rowspan="2" |Item!! colspan="2" |Chance

|}

== Drops ==
An adult fox drops {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} are dropped. Killing a baby fox yields no experience. 

Foxes always drop any item they pick up and are still holding (they cannot drop food that they have eaten, for example) and drop items they spawn with naturally with a 100% chance, so:

If a fox is killed while holding a [[totem of undying]], then the fox consumes the totem and revives itself instead of dropping the totem.

== Behavior ==
Foxes occasionally make loud screeches during nighttime, unless a trusted player is near them. Baby foxes follow adult foxes.

During the [[night]], foxes sometimes go to nearby [[village]]s.

Foxes flee from nearby [[wolves]], [[polar bear]]s or players unless the player is trusted or approaches them while [[sneaking]]. They take no damage or speed reduction while moving through [[sweet berry bush]]es.

[[File:Fox jump.gif|thumb|left|An animation showing a fox's jump during an attack on a [[chicken]].]]
Foxes attack [[chicken]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[cod]], [[salmon]] and [[tropical fish]], and baby [[turtle]]s while they are on land. Foxes don't attack [[player]]s, [[wolves]], [[polar bear]]s, [[zoglin]]s, "Johnny" [[vindicator]]s, [[warden]]s or [[goat]]s even if they are being attacked by them.

Foxes attack either by running against or by pouncing. Like [[rabbit]]s and [[goat]]s, foxes can pounce more than one block high without status effects or player input. Similar to goats, they do not attack the player when hit. A fox prepares to pounce by tilting and lowering its head and lowering its body to become shorter. Then it leaps up to four blocks{{verify|Is it the actual cap? The height is random; so far as I've tested it's the highest I got}} into the [[air]], jumping over [[fence]]s and [[wall]]s if needed. If the target mob moves from its location during this sequence, the pounce misses the target. {{IN|bedrock}}, foxes also shake side to side before pouncing and their legs wave while in midair. 

Foxes can safely fall 5 blocks before they start to accumulate fall damage, unlike most mobs, which can only fall 3 blocks safely.

While foxes are capable of jumping over fences and walls, they cannot see through them.<ref>{{bug|MC-144623||Foxes can't see mobs that are in fenced areas or behind glass blocks|WF}}</ref> A fox does not try to attack a mob on the same y-level if there is a fence between them.

Red foxes prefer to attack chickens, rabbits and baby turtles, all of which are on land, over cod, salmon, and tropical fish; conversely, snow foxes prefer to attack cod, salmon and tropical fish over land-dwelling creatures.

[[File:Fox in snow layer.png|thumb|A snow fox stuck in a snow layer when attacking.]]
A fox that pounces into a [[snow layer]] becomes momentarily stuck, remaining face-down, emitting [[particles]] while shaking, and returning to normal shortly after.

Foxes swim to attack fish in water for food. Baby foxes following adults into the water cannot swim and may eventually drown.

Foxes attempt to run toward the closest attackable [[mob]], even if attached to a [[lead]], but do not attempt to break the lead. A fox wakes up from sleeping to attack a mob.

Wild wolves are aggressive toward foxes when within 18{{only|java|short=1}}/16{{only|bedrock|short=1}} [[block]]s. {{IN|java}}, adult [[polar bear]]s also sneak toward foxes to attack them; {{in|bedrock}} adult polar bears attack foxes within 16 blocks. {{IN|java}}, baby polar bears, though normally passive to players, also attempt to attack foxes within 16 blocks or when their adult polar bear attacks one.

=== Sleeping ===
Foxes are one of the few mobs in the game that can sleep, along with [[cat]]s, [[villager]]s and [[bat]]s.

During the [[day]], if a [[thunderstorm]] is not occurring, foxes attempt to find a space with a sky [[light]] level of 14 or less and sleep. Block light has no effect on this. While it sleeps, it slowly moves its head up and down. A fox wakes if approached by a [[player]] or [[mob]]. Foxes do not flee if a player approaches while [[sneaking]] until the player gets on an adjacent [[block]].

If the sky [[light]] at the fox's position becomes 15 or above, either due to a [[block]] above being destroyed or the fox being moved, the fox wakes up.

Foxes can drop and pick up [[item]]s in their sleep.

Trusting foxes can fall asleep even if attached to a [[lead]]. They can also be moved with leads while sleeping.

Foxes do not sleep if they are within 12 [[block]]s of an [[armor stand]], or a [[camera]] {{in|edu}}.

=== Sitting ===
{{info needed section|More specific mechanics}}
A fox sits down sometimes if the fox cannot find a shaded area to sleep. The fox sits for a short time, then hops back up. Foxes sit down even when attached to a [[lead]] or in a [[boat]]. Foxes that have not been bred by the player always sit while in the Nether, even while attached to a [[lead]].

=== Holding items ===
If any [[item]] is on the ground near a fox, it travels to the item and picks it up, and the item appears in the fox's mouth.
However, usually a fox chooses to attack a mob over picking up an item. This behavior is not limited to [[food]] and animal products; a fox can pick up any item that the [[player]] can pick up. However, they prefer to pick up food items, and if they have already picked up non-food items, they drop the non-food items to pick up food instead. A fox can also swap a food item it is holding for a different food item.
[[File:Tamed Fox With Egg in Mouth.png|thumb|A fox with an egg inside its mouth.]]

[[File:Fox harvesting sweet berries without eating them.png|alt=A picture of a fox, holding an item in its mouth, sitting on a trapdoor above a sweet berry bush. The berries are on the ground. |left|thumb|A fox harvesting sweet berries without eating them. ]]
A fox eats any food item it picks up (besides cake) after 30 seconds and the fox is affected by any side effects from the food, such as poison or teleportation. For example, if a fox eats an [[enchanted golden apple]], it obtains the [[Absorption]], [[Resistance]], [[Fire Resistance]] and [[Regeneration]]. If a fox eats any type of soup or stew, an empty [[bowl]] is dropped. If a fox eats a [[chorus fruit]], it teleports accordingly.

If there is a stage 3 or 4 [[sweet berry bush]] within a 16 [[block]] radius of a fox, it sprints toward the bush and eats the [[sweet berries]], dropping the item it was holding. However, if the fox stands on a solid block directly above the sweet berry bush and is already holding an item, the fox will harvest the sweet berries, making them drop, but will not eat them nor drop the item it was holding. Foxes are not damaged or slowed by sweet berry bushes. 

Although visually holding items in its mouth, they are functionally being held in its [[Dual wield|main hand]]; therefore, the fox is affected by any effects of a given held item. A [[sword]] increases its damage, and a [[totem of undying]] saves it from death, for instance. If a fox picks up a [[weapon]] or an item with [[enchantments]], such as Looting and Fire Aspect, these items affect the fox's attack as if the fox is wielding the weapon in its main hand, although the item retains its [[durability]] when used by the fox. If a fox is holding a [[totem of undying]], it receives the effects after taking fatal damage. {{IN|bedrock}}, if a fox wields a sword with the Fire Aspect enchantment while attacking a mob on a [[campfire]] or a soul campfire, it ignites the campfire and does critical [[damage]] to the entity.

Foxes do not pick up items when <code>gamerule mobGriefing</code> is set to <code>false</code>.

=== Breeding ===
When [[sweet berries]] or [[glow berries]] are {{control|used}} on two foxes, the foxes [[breed]], producing a baby fox. If a red fox is bred with a snow fox, the baby has a 50% chance of being either a red or snow fox.

=== Trust ===
[[File:Player being attacked by a fox.png|thumb|right|A fox that trusts a different player attacking the player.]]
[[Breeding]] two adults with [[sweet berries]] or [[glow berries]] produces a baby fox that trusts the [[player]] that bred it and does not flee from that player as it grows up; however, because baby foxes also follow nearby adult foxes, an adult running away from the player may cause the baby to do the same.    
[[File:Trusting fox.jpg|thumb|A trusting fox, notice it does not run from the player or attack the chicken next to it. ]]   

Naturally spawned baby foxes do not trust players.

Foxes attack specific [[mob]]s that hurt a [[player]] they trust. When attacking phantoms, foxes do not jump to attack.

{{IN|bedrock}}, foxes that trust a [[player]] attack any mob that harms their trusted player, including other players. {{IN|Java}}, foxes defend the player from the following damage sources:<ref>{{bug|MC-166787||Trusted foxes still don't defend players from all types of attacks|WF}}</ref>
*melee attacks from players and mobs except [[dolphin]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[wolves]], [[bee]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[killer bunnies]], [[slime]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[hoglin]]s, or [[zoglin]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-172371||Trusting foxes don't defend players from hoglins/zoglins}}</ref>
*projectile damage from arrows, fireballs or wind charges.
*defensive damage from pufferfish.

Foxes do not retaliate against players who harm them, but they still attack players who damage players they trust.
[[File:Trusting fox attacking zombie.jpg|thumb|A trusting fox attacking a zombie that hit the player it trusts. ]]

Trusting foxes retreat from polar bears and wolves but not tamed wolves. A tamed wolf whose owner attacks a trusting fox also attacks the fox.

The player can summon a neutral fox in [[singleplayer]] with the command {{cmd|summon fox ~ ~ ~ {Trusted:[I;<player UUID>]<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}, where {{cd|<player UUID>}} is the [[UUID]] of the player as an int-array, with commas separating the 4 integers. Like other neutral mobs, foxes are passive in [[Peaceful]] difficulty. Unlike other neutral mobs, a neutral fox is not aggravated by [[firework]] damage.<ref>{{bug|MC-111498||Fireworks and water bottles damage don't make neutral mobs angry or hostile|Fixed}}</ref>

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*The {{W|red fox|newtab=1}} (''Vulpes vulpes'') and the {{W|Arctic fox|newtab=1}} (''Vulpes lagopus'') are two different species in real life, so they cannot produce fertile offspring like they can in-game.
*In the real world, some species of fox jump high to catch their prey by surprise, an action reflected in their ''Minecraft'' counterpart.
*When foxes were being added into ''Minecraft'', a glitch made them look like boxes.<ref>{{ytl|EbPrkqn9PMA|Village & Pillage: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|Mojang}}</ref>
*Baby foxes are small enough that when they swim, they take drowning damage. This is noticeable when they attempt to attack fish.
*There is a [[splash]] screen "In case it isn't obvious, foxes aren't players" in the game, which was added from the description of the bug {{Bug|MC-166292}}.
*The first and third screeching sounds foxes make are the same. The first sound is the third in reverse, but higher-pitched, and the third is the first in reverse, but lower-pitched.
*Fox sounds are actually combined and heavily edited cat and dog sounds.<ref>{{ytl|n23fRyOfOOg|The Secrets of Minecraft: Death Sounds, Secret Animals, and Other Delights! @4:35|Minecraft|November 19, 2021|t=274s}}</ref>
