[[File:Lower Sky.png|thumb|The lower sky in a [[Buffet]] world in [[Java Edition 1.13.2|1.13.2]], with VBOs turned off.]]
The '''lower sky''' was a visual effect in the [[Overworld]] in which a colored plane existed below the horizon in the world, similarly to the [[sky]] opposite it. It was removed, presumably accidentally, during 1.14's development; Mojang have since decided that this removal was intentional.<ref>{{bug|MC-257056}}</ref>
