The '''leftover''' is a joke [[block]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]] that forms the "zones" in the "zones" dimension.

== Obtaining ==
The leftover cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. The leftover can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}}, and naturally generates in the "zones" dimension. It cannot be destroyed by [[tool]]s or [[explosion]]s.

=== Natural generation ===
Leftovers naturally generate in the "zones" in the "zones" dimension, forming areas of danger throughout the overworld-like environment.

== Usage ==
The leftover is non-solid, and invisible apart from emitting "Happy Villager" particles. An entity entering it is inflicted by [[Blindness]] II and [[Poison]] IV for 3 seconds each. It is not possible for other blocks to be placed inside of a leftover, nor can [[piston]]s move or destroy it. When an item is thrown into it, it affects the gravity of the item.
