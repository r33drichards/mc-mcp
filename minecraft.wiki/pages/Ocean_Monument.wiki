{{relevant tutorial|Defeating an ocean monument}}
'''Ocean monuments''', also known as simply '''monuments''', are rare underwater [[structure]]s found in [[deep ocean]] [[biome]]s and variants. They are inhabited by [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s. They are the only place where [[sponge]]s can be found and one of the two places where [[prismarine]] can be found; the other being [[ocean ruins]].

== Generation ==
Ocean monuments generate in areas with deep ocean biome variants everywhere within a 16 block square radius around the center point, and an aquatic biome (regular/deep/frozen ocean or regular/frozen river) everywhere within a 29 block square radius around the center point. In order to prevent air pockets, water generates around the monument as a part of the structure. The four blocks in the exact middle always generate each in a different chunk. It is the largest structure that does not contain a loot [[chest]] and the largest  structure found underwater. An ocean monument can also overwrite other structures like [[stronghold]]s during generation. A maximum of one ocean monument may generate in every 512×512 block area.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, ocean monuments always generate at the same [[Altitude|Y-level]], with the top of the roof always at Y=56. Seafloor surrounding the monument is cut off if it is higher than the monument's base.

They can be located with ocean [[explorer map]]s, which are bought from apprentice-level cartographer [[villager]]s with [[emerald]]s.

The area of the ocean monument spawns only guardians after generating, also being the only location they spawn. Ocean monuments always contain three elder guardians – one at the top and one in each wing.

{{In|Bedrock}}, the [[particle]] of the elder guardian inflicting [[Mining Fatigue]] III is a separate entity, the [[elder guardian ghost]].

== Structure ==
{{main|Ocean Monument/Structure}}

[[File:Sponge and treasure.png|thumb|right|The treasure chamber with a sponge room (smaller dark prismarine room) to its left.]]

The monument is constructed entirely from variants of [[prismarine]] and lit by [[sea lantern]]s. It includes a large central section flanked by two wings. Under the monument are 23 giant pillars that stretch to the ocean floor. The main entrance is located at the front of the central section. The base size of the structure is 58×58 blocks. Thus, the ocean monument (the location where [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s spawn) area is 3,364 square blocks.

[[File:MonumentOcean3.png|thumb|left|Certain rooms in the monument contain wet sponges.]]

The central section consists of various types of chambers. The chambers are randomly generated; each monument has a different number of rooms (at least six) arranged in a unique manner. The chambers connect vertically and horizontally to the different parts of the monument, including the left and right wings. At the topmost room resides an elder guardian. Around the center of the central section lies the treasure chamber, a tall room with eight [[blocks of gold]] encased in [[dark prismarine]].

Occasionally, monuments contain one or more rooms with approximately 30 [[wet sponge]]s on the ceiling. Sponge rooms have an opening only in the floor. Ocean monuments are not guaranteed to generate sponge rooms.

One of the wings contains a large room with a small pillar at the center. The room contains a second elder guardian. The other wing consists of a large open space with a large, square-shaped platform, containing another elder guardian. A long hallway that arcs around the wings and the back portion of the monument connects the two wings together.

|At their addition, ocean monuments may generate in existing [[chunk]]s with an {{cd|InhabitedTime}} (i.e. the amount of time players have been in the chunk) of less than 3 minutes.
