A '''goat''' is a [[neutral mob]] found in certain [[mountain]]ous [[biome]]s. It can jump especially high and is [[milk]]able. Goats occasionally ram other [[mob]]s and [[player]]s, and cannot be provoked. Ramming into certain [[block]]s causes a [[goat horn]] to drop if the goat has any.

== Spawning ==
Groups of two to three goats spawn above [[stone]], [[gravel]], [[packed ice]] or [[snow blocks]] on snowy slopes, jagged peaks, and frozen peaks at the surface. Goats spawn individually and more uncommonly after the world generation. 5% of all goats spawn as babies.

When a goat is spawned naturally or through breeding normal goats, it has a 2% chance of being a '''screaming'''{{only|je|short=1}}/'''screamer'''{{only|be|short=1}} '''goat'''. They look identical to all other goats, but they make screaming sounds and ram more often.

Screaming{{only|JE|short=1}}/screamer{{only|BE|short=1}} goats can also be manually summoned with the following commands:

In ''Java Edition'': {{Cd|code=/summon minecraft:goat ~ ~ ~ {IsScreamingGoat:1b<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}

In ''Bedrock Edition'': {{Cd|code=/summon goat ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:born_screamer}} However, this might not work due to [[bugtracker:MCPE-130746|MCPE-130746]]. Additionally, if this doesn't work, use the {{cmd|event}} command.

Adult goats have a 10% chance to be missing one of their horns upon spawning. If this chance succeeds, either the left or the right horn is removed (chosen randomly with an equal chance for each).

{{Mob spawn table|Goat}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Adult goats drop {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. Killing a baby goat yields no [[item]]s or [[experience]].

=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} is dropped upon successful [[breeding]].

=== Goat horns ===
[[File:A goat with a bald head.png|thumb|right|A goat when both horns are knocked off.]]
Goats drop a [[goat horn]] when they charge into any of the following [[solid block]]s: [[stone]], [[coal ore]], [[copper ore]], [[iron ore]], [[emerald ore]], [[log]]s, or [[packed ice]]. {{IN|java}}, these blocks are listed under the {{cd|snaps_goat_horn}} [[block tag (Java Edition)|tag]], and can be modified using a [[data pack]].

There are 4 horn variants for normal goats ("Ponder", "Sing", "Seek", and "Feel"), and 4 horn variants that only screaming goats drop ("Admire", "Call", "Yearn", and "Dream"). Goats do not regrow their horns; therefore, up to two horns can be dropped per goat, or one horn if the goat spawned with only one horn.

== Behavior ==
When left to wander, goats tend to ascend hills and mountains rather than keep to lowlands. Their behavior is marked by jumping high and by opportunistically ramming non-moving mobs.

Goats take {{hp|10}} less [[fall damage]] and avoid walking into powder snow. Goats do not get hurt by [[pointed dripstone]] if they fall on it from a minimum of six blocks, and don't die from pointed dripstone if they fall on it from a minimum of ten.

=== Jumping ===
A goat usually jumps when trying to cross an obstacle like a small hole in the ground or [[powder snow]]. It lowers its head, then it leaps up to 10 blocks vertically and up to 5 blocks laterally. Once a goat jumps this way, it cannot do it again for 30 to 60 seconds. A goat also never voluntarily jumps more than 5 blocks down, although a goat can be pushed off a higher cliff by another mob or a [[piston]].

=== Ramming ===

[[File:Goat Stand Ram.jpg|alt=Goat Charge|thumb|A goat speeding at an armor stand.]]

Every 30 seconds to 5 minutes, a goat tries to ram a single unmoving target it can see within a range of 4–16 blocks. They can target players, [[armor stand]]s{{only|JE|short=1}}, [[camera]]s{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}}, and any mob except for [[ghast]]s and other goats. A charging goat locks on to its target's position, lowers its head, stomps, and speeds toward the target. If the charge connects, it deals {{hp|1}} to {{hp|3}} damage (depending on difficulty) and 9 blocks of [[Damage#Knockback|knockback]] to its target, possibly resulting in a damaging or even fatal fall.

As a goat lowers its head, its target has the chance to move out of the way. If a goat misses, it stops itself within a couple blocks, unless it hits a solid block first. If a goat rams a solid block that [[Block tag (Java Edition)#snaps goat horn|occurs naturally in its environment]], it can drop one of its [[goat horn]]s.

Mobs do not retaliate to being rammed, except for [[piglin]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, [[hoglin]]s, [[zoglin]]s, "Johnny" [[vindicator]]s and [[warden]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-227625}}</ref>

If a goat rams against a [[zombified piglin]], all nearby other zombified piglins will come to its groups and will attack the goat who impacted the zombified piglin.

Goats don't target players in [[Creative]] mode or any players in Peaceful [[difficulty]]. Unlike most neutral mobs, goats do not attack the player if the player attacks it and do not call for backup if harmed.

Baby goats deal a knockback of 4.5 blocks. A screaming goat tries to ram a valid target every 5 to 15 seconds.

When the player holds wheat on their hand, the goat that was preparing to ram something stops preparing to ram and starts walking up to the player.

=== Milking ===
An adult goat can be milked by {{Control|using}} a [[bucket]] on it, yielding a [[milk bucket]]. Screaming goats make a distinct sound when this happens. 

=== Breeding ===
{{Main|Breeding}}

Goats follow players that are within ten blocks who are holding [[wheat]]. If adult goats are fed wheat, they enter love mode and breed, granting one to seven [[experience]] orbs. The growth time of a baby goat can be accelerated by 10% each time it is fed wheat.

If a standard goat is bred with a screaming goat, there is approximately a 50% chance the resulting baby is a screaming goat. If both goats are screaming, there is a 100% chance in ''Java Edition'' and a 98% chance in ''Bedrock Edition'' that the baby is a screaming goat. With two normal parents, there is a 2% chance of a baby goat being a screaming goat{{only|je|short=1}}. In Bedrock Edition screamer goats cannot be bred.

Baby goats only have horns if they are summoned through one of two commands: {{cmd|/summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasLeftHorn:1} }} or {{cmd|/summon goat ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000, HasRightHorn:1} }}.

== Trivia ==
*Real-life goats cannot have their horns break off without sustaining significant cranial damage. The behavior of ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s goat horns more closely resemble real-life deer antlers, which, unlike goat horns, are not part of the animal's skull.
*The model for goats was made in Blockbench.<ref>{{Tweet|blockbench|1321900157592576004|Goats, made in Blockbench:}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|HaGdVUcHIbE|Minecraft Live 2021: Minecraft Marketplace|Minecraft|October 22, 2021}}</ref>
*While named goats, they most closely resemble [[w:Mountain goat|mountain goats]], relatives which aren't true goats. The sounds for ''Minecraft'' goats were, however, recorded from real domestic goats.<ref>{{tweet|slamp0000|1377316464018001923|Getrud and her bröther.}}</ref>
*In early development versions of [[Bedrock Edition 1.19.0]], goats could be eaten by [[frogs]].<ref>{{YouTube link|3Tcd_ZjMBvE|Changing Minecraft 1.19's Frog AI…|doctor4t|January 27, 2022}}</ref>
