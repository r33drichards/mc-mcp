}}'''Flint''' is a [[character]] in the novels published by [[Max Brooks]].

== Appearance ==
Flint is described as merely a common sheep mob, or at least near identical. Initially, Guy describes Flint to be a black sheep.
== Personality ==
On the surface, Flint appears (and very likely is) a typical sheep mob, displaying no outward intelligence.

They're sentience is also thrown into question, if not demonstrably proven, in the chapter ''It’s not Failure That Matters, but How You Recover'', where a building Guy constructed is burned to the ground by [[lava]]. Despite the stakes and Guy pleading for he and the other animals to flee, they do not.
