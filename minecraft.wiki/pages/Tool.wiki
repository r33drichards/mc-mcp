{{About|the in-game items|program-enhancing software|Tutorial:Programs and editors}}

A '''tool''' is an [[item]] used by the [[player]] while held to perform actions faster and more efficiently, to gather materials not obtainable by hand, or to perform completely new actions. Tools don't stack in the inventory, and can also be repaired; see [[Item repair]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
{{main|Drops#Mob drops|title1=Drops}}
Some tools can be obtained by killing mobs that carry the equipment.

=== Generated loot ===
{{main|Chest loot}}
Many tools can be found in loot containers in various [[structure]]s. For [[elytra]], this is the only way to obtain the item.

=== Trading ===
{{Main|Trading}}
Stone, iron, and diamond tools, as well as shears and fishing rods, can be [[Trading|bought]] from [[villager]]s.

=== Villager gifts ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
{{IN|java}}, toolsmith [[villager]]s throw stone tools at players under the [[Hero of the Village]] effect, while weaponsmith villagers throw stone, iron and golden axes.

=== Fishing ===
Fishing rods can be obtained from [[fishing]].

=== Crafting ===
Most tools can be obtained through crafting.

=== Upgrading ===
[[Netherite]] tools can be obtained only through upgrading.

== Usage ==
=== Best tools ===
{{main|Breaking#Best tools|title1=Breaking}}

Many blocks have a preferred tool to break them with: this preferred tool can be a [[pickaxe]], [[shovel]], [[axe]], [[hoe]], or [[shears]]. Some blocks can be obtained only by breaking them with certain tools. The tool's material also affects how fast a block is mined and what it drops. Materials from worst to best in terms of mining speed are: wooden, stone, copper, iron, diamond, netherite, gold; also see [[Tiers]].

=== Item durability ===
{{main|Durability}}

Different tools have different amounts of durability. Some uses require more durability to be used than others. A tool's durability is also affected by its material. Materials from worst to best in terms of durability are: gold, wooden, stone, iron, diamond, netherite.

Some tools are not block-breaking tools: this includes a [[fishing rod]], [[carrot on a stick]], [[warped fungus on a stick]], [[flint and steel]], [[brush]] and [[elytra]]. Such tools are no better than bare fists at breaking blocks, but they do not take damage from doing so; they take damage from being used in their own intended manners. All block-breaking tools, excluding pickaxes, also have other uses than just breaking blocks: for example, shovels can create [[dirt path]]s, axes can be used to strip [[log]]s and [[wood]], hoes can till soil and create [[farmland]], and shears can be used to shear [[sheep]]. All of these actions also consume a tool's durability.

=== Item enchantability ===
Some tools can be [[enchanted]] using an [[enchanting table]]: these include pickaxes, shovels, axes, hoes and the fishing rod. Other tools can receive enchantments only through the use of an [[anvil]] and [[enchanted book]]s. Materials from worst to best in terms of [[enchantability]] are: [[stone]], [[diamond]], [[iron]], [[Wood (disambiguation)|wooden]]/[[netherite]], [[gold]].

=== Smelting ===
{{main|Smelting}}

Tools made from ingots (excluding [[netherite]]) can be smelted into their respective [[nugget]]s.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Gold tools are actually ranked as superior to diamond tools on the [[Legacy Console Edition]]'s crafting screen.
* Wooden tools can be burned in a furnace regardless of their durability; this means the player can burn a wooden tool that has only 1 use left.
