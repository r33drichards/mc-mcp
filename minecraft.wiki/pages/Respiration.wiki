'''Respiration''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[helmet]]s that extends underwater breathing time.

== Obtaining ==
Respiration can be obtained from [[enchanting tables]], drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]],{{only|bedrock}} books obtained by [[fishing]], [[monster room]] chests, librarian [[villager]]s, and non-village [[structure]] loot.

== Usage ==
Respiration grants an [[oxygen bonus]] of +1 per enchantment level, which equates to +15 seconds per level in addition to the default time of 15 seconds. It also grants a chance of not taking drowning damage each second by {{cd|level / (level + 1)}}.  The maximum level that can be obtained without commands is level 3, resulting in a total time of 60 seconds underwater (including the base time without enchantments) before drowning begins, and a 75% chance to not take drowning damage each second. Wearing a [[turtle shell]] extends this time by an additional 10 seconds. Respiration can be applied to non-helmet items by use of commands.
