[[File:Corner Far Lands.png|thumb|The "corner" of the Far Lands, at ±12,550,821 on both X and Z axes, creating the corner Far Lands.]]

== Lоcation ==
The initial Far Lands set occurs between 12,550,821 and 12,550,824 on the positive X and Z axes, and always -12,550,824 on the negative. Putting the numbers together, a standard Minecraft map in Bedrock Edition prior to [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.30|1.17.30]] or Java Edition before [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], is about 25,101,642 blocks wide along the X axes and 25,101,650 wide along the Z axes. For comparison, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about 40,075,000 meters.

== Structure ==
Both areas of the Far Lands feature extremely strange terrain, although they are significantly different.

In both zones, any area beneath sea level, excluding regular caves, are flooded with water. The Far Lands generate [[biome]]s, but most biomes are indistinguishable except by the color of grass. Desert biomes are covered in sand and snow-covered biomes are covered with snow, excluding the very top of the map due to the height build limit. Trees generate somewhat normally, but can be found only in the upper areas of the map due to the need for skylight.

[[Ore]]s can be found up to their respective maximum heights just like in the normal world. Unfortunately, due to the flooding, everything except for [[coal]] can be extremely difficult to acquire. In the solid areas of the Far Lands, normal [[cave]]s still generate but are limited and small. Along with the caves, [[dungeon]]s (which are extremely rare) and [[lake]]s can be found in solid areas. [[Water]] and [[lava]] springs can be found out in the open and in caves.

Much of the open space in both areas are shrouded in darkness and thus hostile [[mob]]s run rampant, making the Far Lands as a whole incredibly dangerous. This is especially problematic in the Corner Far Lands due to its layered structure. The flooded zones have an abundance of [[squid]].

=== Edge Far Lands ===
The Far Lands edge boundary (that is, where it meets the regular map) looks like a solid wall, all the way to the top of the map (Y coordinate 127 in beta 1.8 and earlier) which is filled with gaping holes perpendicular to the edge. These holes are extremely long, perhaps "endless", and on the whole seem to change very little, however deep the player's adventures. They can be blocked, partially or completely, but these blockages are rare and temporary. This "Swiss Cheese Wall" pattern continues below ground level, to the bottom of the map, and appears to be partially caused by a large one-dimensional distortion in the output of the map generator. This area is sometimes called “the loop”. Early versions of the Far Lands also looked much more like randomly placed pixels interpolated solely with diagonal lines.

The Edge Far Lands' average block composition: 36% [[stone]], 25% [[air]], 23% [[water]], 10% [[dirt]]/[[grass block]], 2% [[bedrock]], and 4% others. (Based on a 14×14 [[chunk]] selection)

==== 64-Bit Far Lands ====
At X/Z ±53,905,378,859,432,512 the 64-Bit Far Lands generate.

They appear for the same reason the 32-Bit Far Lands generate (2<sup>31</sup>−1÷171.103), but at their 64-Bit respective coordinates (2<sup>63</sup>−1÷171.103). They are repetitive in the corner like the Bedrock Edition Far Lands.

Because of their distance from the world's center, they cannot be viewed without extensive modding. This is why they weren't removed from the game.<gallery>

=== Corner Far Lands ===
At a corner, when two perpendicular Edge Far Lands sections meet, the Corner Far Lands begin to generate. Unlike the infinite-length holes in the Edge Far Lands, the Corner Far Lands contains more normal terrain. This terrain is "stacked" on top of itself to create a bizarre sandwich with layers of ground and air, which gives it its nickname, "The Stack". Each layer looks like a giant floating continent, hovering over the next layer, which is shadowed.

The majority of the generated world is Corner Far Lands, as the "normal" map (before ±12,550,821 mark) makes only the center of the world, and the Edge Far Lands make only its continued sides.

The number of layers is not always the same and varies between five and seven (fusing together and splitting every so often). Layers can be grouped into three categories:
* '''Top layer:''' This layer exists at the absolute top of the map. Occasionally there can be a lower area that is not shadowed (this is technically a dry layer). The lower area is where a majority of the trees and passive mobs can be found, as the top layer receives almost all of the sunlight. Due to the lack of space, the area at the absolute top cannot have trees or mobs.
** The top layer tends to light incorrectly in day-night transitions. This is because the sunlight calculation does not work correctly when the entire chunk is blocked at Y-coordinate 128 in early versions.
* '''Dry layers:''' These generate slightly flatter than normal terrain and have grass, despite the darkness. At sea level, massive floating beaches can be found. Hostile mobs' spawn rate likely approaches the maximum due to being in the shadow of the top layer. Rarely, there are holes in the top layer that allow sunlight to reach these layers. Caves that have one of these layers as their "surface" can occasionally be carved out of dirt instead of stone. These layers have cave-like ceilings made out of stone, gravel and dirt.
* '''Flooded layers:''' Like the dry layers, these generate somewhat flat terrain, but it is comprised primarily of [[stone]]. [[Sand]] and [[sandstone]] appear down here, even down to 30 blocks below sea level. Except for coal, all the [[ore]]s can be found only in these layers.
Sometimes, there are extremely tall pillars of gravel that stretch from the ground to the ceiling of a layer. Likewise, some of the beaches that collapse create pillars of sand all the way down to the ground, despite there not being that much sand, to begin with. 

The Corner Far Lands is also prone to having near-perfect diagonal lines being carved into the ceilings or floors of layers. If traced, these lines all intersect at the corner (X/Z ±12,550,821). This seems similar to how the Edge Far Lands have a consistent pattern along lines perpendicular to their edge, but is much less pronounced. These lines can sometimes be seen running through layers, and appear as cliffs at the top layer. The landscape in the Corner Far Lands vary based on these lines, and is consistent when the ratio of how far one axis is past 12,550,821 to the other is kept the same. The diagonal lines only start from the initiation of the Corner Far Lands when X and Z are both positive.

The top of the Corner Far Lands can either have plateaus at the top of the map, bumpy terrain, flatland at the top of the map, or floating islands. It is rare but possible for sunlight to reach the ocean at sea level.

The type of terrain in the Corner Far Lands when one axis is near 12,550,821 is almost exactly mirrored in the quadrant with the opposite sign on the other axis, with minor differences which usually manifest as a one-block-thick layer that is present in one quadrant but absent in the other. For example, the type of terrain seen in the Corner Far Lands when Z is near 12,550,821 in the quadrant with positive X and Z is mirrored in the Corner Far Lands with negative X and positive Z, and the type of terrain seen in the quadrant with positive X and Z when X is near 12,550,821 is mirrored in the Corner Far Lands with positive X and negative Z.

Additionally, the Corner Far Lands in the quadrant with negative X and negative Z are an inversion of the positive Corner Far Lands.

The Corner Far Lands' average block composition: 40% [[stone]], 16% [[air]], 28% [[water]], 10% [[dirt]]/[[Grass Block|grass]], 2% [[bedrock]], and 4% others. (Based on a 14×14 [[chunk]] selection)

=== Farther Lands ===
{{conjecture|Bug|section=1}}

The second set of Far Lands (henceforth called the "Farther Lands") generate when X/Z coordinates reach about ±1,004,065,811, when the Selector Noise overflows, which is about 80 times farther than where the first set initiates, at ±12,550,821 (this is due to the value corresponding to the "Main Noise Scale" value later found in [[Old Customized]] Worlds being 80 by default). The terrain is similar to the first set of Far Lands, but is more stretched out. They also have Edge and Corner types, which are described below. Sometimes you can see infinitely repeated patterns in the Corner Farther Lands, which appear as diagonal lines starting from the corner at 1,004,065,811.

The Edge Farther Lands which extend off of Corner Far Lands are notably distinct from Edge Farther Lands which extend from Edge Far Lands - the former can have infinite horizontal air gaps whereas the latter don't. Sometimes, a diagonal line from the Corner Far Lands can be seen here.

=== Fringe Lands ===
{{conjecture|section=1}}
The Fringe Lands are known from {{BE}} can also generate at extreme distances in the Java Edition, at about 7*10<sup>25</sup> blocks out in the corners, or between 8.175*10<sup>48</sup> and 2.359*10<sup>51</sup> blocks out in the Edges.

It is only possible to see them with manipulating the Noise Scale, or by using mods that allow for travel to extreme distances.{{info needed|What mods?}}

== Effects ==
=== Gameplay ===
Players experience extreme frame-rate drops and very high CPU usage, which continue until ''Minecraft'' freezes completely. The frame-rate drops do not occur in multiplayer servers, though the server itself lags depending on the server computer's RAM. In both single-player and multiplayer, the intense lag that is characteristic of the Far Lands is caused by massive numbers of falling [[sand]] or [[gravel]] entities.

[[Lightning]] bolts that hit surfaces at the top of the map (Y-coordinate 127) are invisible and do not cause a fire. The particles created when rain hits these surfaces are black instead of blue. Snow does not accumulate on these surfaces either (because there is no space) unless a top layer tunnel peeks out.

=== Distance effects ===
{{Main|Java Edition distance effects}}
[[File:World rendering precision loss.gif|frame|The most noticeable side effect of the Far Lands, where the map takes longer to update according to the player's location.]]

When travelling away from spawn, every time the distance is doubled from the center of the world, there is an issue with precision, where entities and block hitboxes (where the block should be) still match the shape of the world, but what we see (the blocks) don't. This effect can first be seen at 4096 blocks away from spawn if observed closely, even though it is far less noticeable than what is seen when the player is close to the Far Lands. Past 8,388,608 blocks, the offset is an entire block, which is the extent of the effect seen at the Far Lands.

=== Intentional limits ===
{{main|World boundary}}
The above distance effects continue to get worse until the player reaches X/Z: ±32,000,000, where blocks stop being solid.

== Dimensions ==
The Far Lands of [[the Nether]] and [[Sky dimension]] share characteristics of the Overworld Far Lands, although with some differences.

=== The Nether ===
[[File:Nether Far Lands.png|thumb|right|The Far Lands as seen in the [[Nether]].]]

The [[Nether]] Far Lands are similar to the Overworld Far Lands, except generated with Nether terrain features, with a [[lava]] ocean at Y=31.

In the Nether, the terrible lag associated with the Overworld Far Lands does not occur; most of the Nether is already dark enough for spawns in the first place, and there are fewer gravity-affected blocks (no sand, and gravel is rare).

If a [[nether portal]] is created in the Far Lands of the Overworld, entering causes a teleportation to normal Nether, as X/Z 32,000,000, the limit at which block physics and lighting cease to function, divided by 8 (as 1 block in the nether corresponds to 8 blocks in the Overworld), is X/Z 4,000,000, within the limits of X/Z 12,550,820, where the distortion starts. Conversely, a nether portal built in the Nether Far Lands does not function, as even at the limit of 12,550,820 blocks at the beginning of the Far Lands, it would cause the player to come out at X/Z 100,406,560, far past X/Z 32,000,000. If a portal is entered beyond X/Z 4,000,000 in the Nether, it causes the game to crash. Entering a portal at exactly X/Z: 4,000,000 in the Nether teleports the player around 8-16 blocks from the 32,000,000 limit. 

The Far Lands do not generate above the [[bedrock]] ceiling.

The Nether can be a great way to reach the Far Lands in the [[Overworld]], as every block in the Nether counts as 8 blocks in the Overworld. The player must travel to 1,568,853 or higher to spawn in the Far Lands. Teleporting just a few blocks less allows the player to see the beginning of the Far Lands.

=== Sky Dimension ===
[[File:Sky Dimension Far Lands Edge.jpg|thumb|right|The Far Lands as seen in the [[sky dimension]].]]
The [[Sky Dimension]] similarly has no trademark liquid and generates no water/lava, and also no bedrock generates. They appear squashed similarly to those of the End.

The Sky Dimension Far Lands appears just like the End Far Lands, but with Overworld features.

This is also the area where the player is most likely to find diamonds. In any other area, the islands do not spawn low enough for diamonds to spawn. The Sky Dimension Far Lands do spawn all the way to Y: 0, so the player can find rare ores inside the Far Lands.

== Cause ==
{{cleanup|move some of this to [[Noise generator]] and link to there}}
The terrain is generated based on 16 octaves of {{w|Perlin noise}}, specifically those used for [[low noise]] and [[high noise]]. Each noise generator takes floating-point inputs and uses those to interpolate between noise values at whole numbers. It does so by:

# Casting to a 32-bit integer, where Java rounds toward zero and handles overflow by picking the closest representable value;
# Subtracting one if the integer is greater than the original input, to always round down;
# Subtracting that integer from the original input to get a remainder in the interval [0, 1) suitable for interpolation.

It covers an interval of [−2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31</sup>) without causing any problems. The problem is that many of the octaves cover a scale much smaller than a block, with up to 171.103 noise units per block. Indeed, 2<sup>31</sup> ≈ 171.103×12,550,824.053. Thus, the effects of the Far Lands start 12,550,824 blocks away from the center of the Minecraft world. Once this value is exceeded, the integer is always 2<sup>31</sup>−1 (2,147,483,647), picking the same noise values on that axis every time. This is the reason for the long unchanging tunnels in the Edge Far Lands, and plains in the Corner Far Lands.

The Farther Lands are caused by an overflow in [[selector noise]], as opposed to the low and high noise that cause the initial set of Far Lands to generate; while selector noise does repeat more often than low and high noise, only half as many octaves are used, causing them to overflow much further out.

At the positive end, the remainder starts out relatively small but usually much larger than 1, and grows by 171.103 per block. At the negative end, the remainder starts at −2<sup>32</sup>. This value is then adjusted by ((6x−15)x+10)x<sup>3</sup> for quintic interpolation. Even one block in at the positive end, this is already around 10<sup>11</sup>. The negative end starts all the way around −10<sup>49</sup>. For the Corner Far Lands, multiply the values of both edges. When interpolation (really extrapolation) is attempted with values as large as these, it produces similarly large output. That output completely dwarfs all other terms that would normally give the terrain its shape, instead effectively passing only the sign of this one noise function through.

It was fixed by taking the remainder of the input divided by 2<sup>24</sup>. Noise repeats every 2<sup>8</sup> units anyway, so it has no side effects. However, it does prevent the overflow. By removing these instructions, the Far Lands can be returned to current versions of the game.<ref name="reddit explanation">{{reddit|2su65c/i_resurrected_the_far_lands_in_181|cnsuqnt|I resurrected the Far Lands in 1.8.1|footstuff|January 18, 2015}}</ref>

There are several other factors to the cause of the Far Lands, making things slightly more complicated:

* Noise is sampled only every four blocks and linearly interpolated in between. This is why when 12,550,824 is affected by the bug, it reaches out three more blocks to 12,550,821.
* Each noise generator picks a random offset in [0, 256) to add to its input. This usually moves the boundary under 12,550,824, starting the Far Lands at 12,550,821. With a few seeds, it might not, putting the start at 12,550,825. Very rarely, if the boundary is just barely within 12,550,824, the first couple blocks of the Far Lands might look somewhat normal. The southern and eastern Far Lands do this independently of one another. At the negative end, the Far Lands always start at block coordinate −12,550,825, with the positive edge of those blocks at −12,550,824.
* The two sets of noise generators (low noise and high noise) are blended together based on another noise generator (selector noise). This is responsible for relatively smooth alternation between two sets of tunnels or plains. Occasionally, one of the noise generators starts generating the Far Lands before the other because it uses a different offset, producing an incongruous boundary.

A table of relevant values are as follows:
{{:Noise generator/Tables/Terrain}}

While most of these values have can be ignored, it can indeed be seen that the low and high noise increment by 171.103 each block, or 684.412 each sampling at four blocks; dividing 2,147,483,648 by this indeed results in the value 12,550,824 being returned.

== Trivia ==
* Even though Beta 1.6 made it impossible to place solid blocks at layer 128, the Far Lands' flat "ceiling" still gets generated there.
* Because of the debates over renaming [[endermen]] to "Far Landers", [[Notch]] jokingly suggested to rename the Far Lands to The End instead. This then became the name for the dimension where the [[ender dragon]] resides.<ref>{{tweet|notch|97216060708753408|/v/ is petitioning me to change the name from "Endermen" to "Farlanders". How about we just rename the "far lands" to "the end" instead? ;D|July 31, 2011}}</ref>
* One of the random [[splash]]es reads: "Check out the far lands!". Ironically, the splash was added to the game ''after'' the Far Lands were fixed.
* In the fourth episode of [[Minecraft: Story Mode]], Jesse and their group visit the Far Lands, in which a secret lab is located. The character Ivor describes the Far Lands as "a happy accident", and "nature's way of keeping life interesting". The bizarre terrain is featured and observed by the characters, although understandably, the glitches associated with it are not present.
* A reference to the Far Lands is featured in the title for Steve's Classic Mode in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'', called "Journey to the Far Lands".
