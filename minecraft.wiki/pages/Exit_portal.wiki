The '''exit portal''' (also known as the '''End podium''' or '''End fountain''') is a portal that enables the player to return to their [[spawn point]], activating upon each defeat of the [[ender dragon]]. It is the only way for entities to leave [[the End]] dimension.

== Generation ==
The exit portal always generates at the [[coordinates]] <code>0,0</code> in [[the End]], and is de-activated whenever an ender dragon fight is in progress. The [[Altitude|y-level]] of the exit portal is determined by the height of the terrain, placing the [[End Portal (block)|End portal block]]s at the y-level of the highest block found at <code>0,0</code>. If the exit portal spawns at the height limit, the portal blocks are the highest blocks generated, with the top 3 blocks of the bedrock pillar failing to generate due to the maximum build height having been reached. If there are no blocks at <code>0,0</code>, the portal generates with the base at Y=0.

== Construction ==
{{main|Exit portal/Structure}}

{{FakeImage|align=left|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|b=Bedrock|x=End portal|  bbb  | bxxxb |bxxxxxb|bxxbxxb|bxxxxxb| bxxxb |  bbb  }}|Activated exit portal (top view).}}
The exit portal looks similar to the [[End portal]] but differs in its design. Instead of a frame of [[End portal frame]] blocks, it has a 7-block wide bowl-shaped frame of [[bedrock]], and a central pillar of bedrock with a torch on each side. A [[dragon egg]] generates atop the pillar upon defeating the ender dragon for the first time (and the second time {{in|be}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-51345}}</ref>).

There are 16 [[End stone]] blocks, one under each outer bedrock block, as well as four [[torch]]es. If any of the blocks other than the dragon egg are removed, they regenerate when the [[ender dragon]] is defeated or respawned, making it the only [[Renewable resource|renewable]] source of End stone.

== Behavior ==
The portal returns the player to their [[individual spawn point]]. The [[credits]] roll when a player enters the exit portal for the first time. If the player doesn't have a spawn point or it is obstructed, they return to the world spawn. If the player's respawn point is set with a [[respawn anchor]], the charge will not be used upon returning.

If an entity other than a player goes through, like a [[falling block]] or a [[item (entity)|thrown item]], it is sent to the [[world spawn]]. The area it arrives in remains loaded for 15 seconds,{{only|je|short=1}} similar to the behavior of [[Nether portal]]s.  

<!-- Kind of redundant, just a special case.
If a player dies above the portal (for example by flying into the bedrock column with enough momentum) the player goes through. If this happens, the player's items return to the world spawn point.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|bedrock}}, if the player manages to break all of the [[End Portal (block)|End portal block]]s in the exit portal, the entire structure regenerates after 5 seconds. If all of the portal blocks have [[End crystal]]s above (so the fire constantly eliminates the portal), this regeneration process repeats until a portal block successfully regenerates.
* If the exit portal generates at the tallest possible height and the [[ender dragon]] is defeated, the portal blocks generate in the exit portal as normal, but the [[dragon egg]] does not spawn due to its intended location surpassing the build [[Altitude|height limit]].
* {{IN|bedrock}}, if there are other End portal blocks in [[the End]] and the exit portal structure is completely destroyed, it does not regenerate until the other end portal blocks are removed.
