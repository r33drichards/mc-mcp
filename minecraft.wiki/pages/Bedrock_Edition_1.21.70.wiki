* The {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} component supports an optional {{cd|tint_method}} field in its instance definitions.
** {{cd|tint_method}} is a string field that multiplies a face color with a tint computed with the biome the block is in. Supported values are {{cd|none}}, {{cd|default_foliage}}, {{cd|birch_foliage}}, {{cd|evergreen_foliage}}, {{cd|dry_foliage}}, {{cd|grass}}, and {{cd|water}}.
** Held block-items are tinted as if they were in the {{cd|plains}} biome. Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:material_instances": {
"*": {
"texture": "minimal",
"render_method": "opaque",
"tint_method": "water"
}
</syntaxhighlight>
*Add {{cd|dry_foliage}} tint method which uses the {{cd|textures/colormap/dry_foliage.png}} color map.
*Exposed the block component {{cd|minecraft:destruction_particles}} as a JSON object. This represents the particles used when the block is destroyed.
**There is two fields for it:
***{{cd|texture}} is a required string field to set the texture used by the particles.
***{{cd|tint_method}} is an optional string field that multiplies the texture color with a predefined tint. Default to {{cd|none}}. Supported values are {{cd|none}}, {{cd|default_foliage}}, {{cd|birch_foliage}}, {{cd|evergreen_foliage}}, {{cd|dry_foliage}}, {{cd|grass}} and {{cd|water}}.
**Block format before 1.21.70 will be upgraded to have the component added using the texture from the {{cd|down}} or {{cd|*}} of the {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} component if present and {{cd|none}} for {{cd|tint_method}}. This was the old behavior.
**Block format from 1.21.70 without the component will not be upgraded and uses the invalid texture. Examples:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
 "minecraft:destruction_particles": {
  "texture": "my_particles_texture",
  "tint_method": "grass"
 }
</syntaxhighlight>
or
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:destruction_particles": {
 "texture": "my_particles_texture"
}
</syntaxhighlight>

:Components
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:replaceable}} component which determines if a new block can replace the existing block at a particular position. If the component is not added to a block it is not replaceable.

'''Commands'''
*Moved the {{cd|place feature}} and {{cd|place featurerule}} subcommands out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment.
*Removed {{cd|set_movement_authority}} command.

'''Components'''
*Multiple components that used effect durations can now be set to {{cd|infinite}} including:
**{{cd|minecraft:attack}}: {{cd|effect_duration}}
**{{cd|minecraft:healable}}: {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|effects}} list
**{{cd|minecraft:mob_effect}}: {{cd|effect_time}}
**{{cd|minecraft:projectile}}: {{cd|durationeasy}}, {{cd|durationnormal}}, and {{cd|durationhard}} can now all use {{cd|infinite}}
**{{cd|minecraft:food}}: {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|effects}} list
**{{cd|minecraft:spell_effects}}: {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|add_effects}} list
**{{cd|minecraft:combat_regeneration}}: {{cd|regeneration_duration}}
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:is_collidable}} component
**This component allows other mobs to have vertical and horizontal collisions with the component's owner.
***For a collision to occur, both mobs must have a {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} component.
***This component can only be used on mobs and enables collisions exclusively between mobs.
**Please note that this type of collision is unreliable for moving mobs.
***It is recommended to use this component only in scenarios where the mob remains stationary.
**Collidable behavior is closely related to stackable behavior.
***While the {{cd|minecraft:is_collidable}} component governs how other mobs interact with the component's owner, the {{cd|minecraft:is_stackable}} component describes how an entity interacts with others of its own kind.
*The {{cd|entity_sensor}} component now has two additional fields: 
**{{cd|y_offset}}, applies a vertical offset to the entity's position when calculating distances to other entities.
**{{cd|find_players_only}}, restricts the search to Players only, affecting all subsensors.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_axis_aligned}} component, that causes the entity's body to automatically rotate to align with the nearest cardinal direction based on its current facing direction.
**Combining this with the {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_blocked}} component will cause the entity to align to the nearest cardinal direction and remain fixed in that orientation, regardless of future changes in its facing direction.
*Added validation for asset references in components.
**Content errors will log missing references for the following fields:
***item references.
***block reference in item component in {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}}.
***loot table reference in block component {{cd|minecraft:loot}}.
*The {{cd|entity_sensor}} component's {{cd|find_players_only}} field now functions correctly, properly restricting searches to Players only and affecting all subsensors.

'''Creator'''
* {{cd|ItemTag}} support in the {{cd|match_tool}} loot table condition no longer requires enabling the "Upcoming Creator Features" experiment toggle.

'''Dedicated Server'''
*Exposed two new parameters for dedicated server when in {{cd|server-auth-with-rewind}}. These will make the server more strict on player positions. Look in {{cd|server.properties}} for more information on what these do.
**{{cd|server-authoritative-movement-strict}} default to {{cd|false}} and can be set to {{cd|true}}. Will affect Player position acceptance.
**{{cd|server-authoritative-dismount-strict}} default to {{cd|false}} and can be set to {{cd|true}}. Will affect Player position when dismounting.
*Exposed a new parameter for dedicated server. This will make the server more strict on entity interactions. Look in {{cd|[[server.properties]]}} for more information on what these do.
**{{cd|server-authoritative-entity-interactions-strict}} default to {{cd|false}} and can be set to {{cd|true}}. Will affect entity interaction acceptance.
*Removed {{cd|server-authoritative-movement}} parameter. It will now always use {{cd|server-auth-with-rewind}}.

'''Entity Components'''
*Added {{cd|on_spawn}} trigger to {{cd|spawn_chance}} on {{cd|hit}} sub-component, triggered on the newly spawned entity with other set to the owning entity.
*Added {{cd|particle_item_name}} map to {{cd|particle_on_hit}} on {{cd|hit}} sub-component, maps an item name to an actor filter to determine what the name of the item used in the particle should be. Falls back to the name of the entity itself as before.

'''Entity Event Responses'''
*Added the {{cd|stop_movement}} entity event response, which stops the entity's movement.
**The {{cd|stop_vertical_movement}} field specifies whether vertical movement should be stopped.
**The {{cd|stop_horizontal_movement}} field specifies whether horizontal movement should be stopped.
**This response does not stop navigation or prevent future movement.
***If that's the desired outcome, also remove the components responsible for that.
*Added the {{cd|set_home_position}} entity event response, which sets the entity's home position to its current position.
**For this to have any effect, the entity must already have a {{cd|minecraft:home}} component.

'''Entity Events'''
*Added {{cd|first_valid}} event type, it will evaluate every filter in order and execute the first valid one.

'''Entity Filters'''
*The {{cd|in_clouds}} entity filter now succeeds when an entity's bounding box intersects the cloud layer, rather than only when its bottom is within it.

'''General'''
*Server Authoritative movement is now turned on by default.

'''Goals'''
*{{cd|minecraft:behavior.float_wander}} AI goal will now restrict mobs to their home position if they have the {{cd|minecraft:home}} component.
* Added {{cd|use_home_position_restriction}} field to {{cd|minecraft:behavior.float_wander}} AI goal to control whether mobs respect home position restrictions when selecting target positions.
** Defaults to {{cd|false}} for entities with format version below {{cd|1.21.70}}, and {{cd|true}} for {{cd|1.21.70}} and later.
** When {{cd|true}}, the mob will respect home position restrictions when selecting target positions.

'''JSON Events'''
*The parameter {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|add_mob_effect}} event can now be set to {{cd|infinite}}.

'''Mobs'''
*Added maximum value of {{cd|100000000.0}} and minimum value of {{cd|-100000000.0}} to {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} component.
*Added [[aquatic]] family-type for all aquatic mobs.
*Normal minecart is no longer considered a mob.

'''Network Protocol'''
*Added {{cd|ActorFlags::COLLIDABLE}}.
*Added {{cd|ActorFlags::BODY_ROTATION_AXIS_ALIGNED}}.
* Added {{cd|ActorFlags::WASD_AIR_CONTROLLED}}.

'''[[Particles]]'''
*Multiple controllers transitioning out of a state at the same time will now properly expire all intended particles instead of just the last one.

'''Sounds'''
*Added support for entity sound variants:
**Entity sounds now have a {{cd|variants}} field which defines sound variants based on the runtime entity
**{{cd|variants}} has a {{cd|key}} field reading a Molang expression returning a string to select sound variant (e.g.: querying an enum entity property).
**{{cd|variants}} has a {{cd|map}} field which contains key-value pairs of a variant identifier and the sound events it overrides.
**When playing a sound for an entity we first try to calculate their variant and see if that variant overrides the sound event, if not we play the sound form the base entity. If that fails we fall back to the existing logic of running from {{cd|defaults}}.
*Example:
**Given a mob with the following property:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:emotional_state": {
  "type": "enum",
  "values": [ "neutral", "angry", "happy", "sad" ],
  "default": "neutral",
  "client_sync": true
}
</syntaxhighlight>

*Sound variants can be played by querying the property:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
{
  "entity_sounds": {
    "entities": {
      "test_mob": {
        "volume": 1.0,

          },
          "attack": "mob.test_mob.attack"
        },
        "variants": {
            // Key returning the enum string for variants, can use any Molang expression resulting in a string
            "key": "query.property('minecraft:emotional_state')",
            "map": {
              // If a resulting variant key is not handled here then it will use the base sounds
              "neutral": {
                "volume": 1.0,
                "pitch": 1.0,
                "events": {
                  // If an event is not handled in a variant then it will use the base sound
                  "death": "mob.test_mob.death.netural"
                }
              },
              "angry": {
                "volume": 1.0,
                "pitch": 1.0,
                "events": {
                  // Variants can override different events than other variants
                  "death": "mob.test_mob.death.angry",
                  "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient.angry"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
*Sound effects found in animations and animation controllers can now include an optional {{cd|locator}} field similar to particle effects allowing them to originate from the locator on the entity rather than the origin.

** Supports adjustments to strafing and backward movement speeds, allowing entities to fly at equal speeds in all directions or move slower when strafing or reversing.
** This component is experimental and as such requires {{cd|use_beta_features}} to be enabled.
** It may undergo significant changes or even be replaced as development progresses.

'''General'''
*In Server Authoritative movement, the Player will not constantly bop up and down if flying state change during small loss of connection with the server. 
*Removing experimental files {{cd|cold_taiga}}, {{cd|cold_taiga_hills}}, and {{cd|cold_taiga_mutated}} from behavior packs. These files were only loaded with the custom biomes experiment enabled, and this change does not remove the biomes themselves.

'''{{cd|@minecraft/server-net}}'''
*Updated the execution privilege of most APIs to allow them to be called in read-only contexts ("before" events).

*Fixed an issue that occurs when cancelling world resource pack download.
*Fixed a crash that occurs when initializing {{cd|minecraft:decorated_pot}} renderer.
*Fixed mirroring and rotation of crafter blocks when part of a structure that is being placed.
