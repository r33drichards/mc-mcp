|{{HistoryLine||v0.5.0|[[File:Glowing Obsidian BE1.png|32px]] Added glowing obsidian.
|Glowing obsidian is generated from the conversion of the [[block]]s that make up the [[Nether reactor]] ([[Nether reactor core]], [[cobblestone]], and [[gold block]]s) upon activation.
|Glowing obsidian cannot be retrieved as a [[drop]], instead regular [[obsidian]] is dropped. 
|Glowing obsidian takes the same amount of time to [[breaking|mine]] as obsidian using any [[pickaxe]]. 
|Glowing obsidian is a solid [[block]] that emits a [[light]] level of 12. 
|Glowing obsidian emits red smoke [[particles]] within proximity to it so long as it exists.
|Glowing obsidian has the same blast resistance as normal obsidian.}}

== Issues ==
Glowing obsidian is an unsupported block, and as such, issues relating to them may not be fixed.

== Trivia ==
* Glowing obsidian makes an appearance in ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two]]'', spawning around the observer when {{MCSM|Jesse}} places the structure block and on the bottom of the obsidian cages {{MCSM|Vos}} was in.
* Glowing obsidian is 2 levels brighter than [[crying obsidian]]. However, at the time when glowing obsidian was available, crying obsidian was not.
