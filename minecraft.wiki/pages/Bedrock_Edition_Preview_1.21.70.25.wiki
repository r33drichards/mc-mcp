'''Beta 1.21.70.25''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.70.25''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the fifth beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.70]], released on February 26, 2025<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/34570334565901-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-70-25|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.70.25|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=February 26, 2025}}</ref>, which fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Leaf Litter]]'''
*Add biome based tinting to leaf litter.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Sheep]]'''
*Reverted the change from [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.21.70.23|Preview 1.21.70.23]] that allowed blue, light blue, cyan, yellow, orange and red sheep to spawn naturally in different biomes.
*Black sheep will still be the most common type to spawn in cold biomes, and brown Sheep will be the most common type in warm biomes.
*Pink sheep will still be very rare and able to spawn anywhere where sheep can spawn.
*Sheep wool texture has been tweaked to remove stark line at the back.

'''[[Wandering Trader]]'''
*Wandering traders' buying trades can now be used twice before they lock instead of only once.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Achievements]]'''
*Enabled earning achievements while playing in a world with [[add-on]]s applied.

=== General ===
'''[[Settings]]'''
*Enabled Filter Profanity toggle on mobile platforms.

'''[[UI]]'''
*Touch controls: camera perspective can now be changed from a HUD button., enable this in the touch settings.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Biome]]s'''
:Client Biome Components
*Add {{cd|minecraft:dry_foliage_color}} component to override color for {{cd|dry_foliage}} tint method.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Add {{cd|dry_foliage}} tint method which uses the {{cd|textures/colormap/dry_foliage.png}} color map.
*Exposed the block component {{cd|minecraft:destruction_particles}} as a JSON object. This represents the particles used when the block is destroyed.
**There is two fields for it:
***{{cd|texture}} is a required string field to set the texture used by the particles.
***{{cd|tint_method}} is an optional string field that multiplies the texture color with a predefined tint. Default to {{cd|none}}. Supported values are {{cd|none}}, {{cd|default_foliage}}, {{cd|birch_foliage}}, {{cd|evergreen_foliage}}, {{cd|dry_foliage}}, {{cd|grass}} and {{cd|water}}.
**Block format before 1.21.70 will be upgraded to have the component added using the texture from the {{cd|down}} or {{cd|*}} of the {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} component if present and {{cd|none}} for {{cd|tint_method}}. This was the old behavior.
**Block format from 1.21.70 without the component will not be upgraded and uses the invalid texture. Examples:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
 "minecraft:destruction_particles": {
  "texture": "my_particles_texture",
  "tint_method": "grass"
 }
</syntaxhighlight>
or
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:destruction_particles": {
 "texture": "my_particles_texture"
}
</syntaxhighlight>

'''[[Commands]]'''
*Removed {{cd|set_movement_authority}} command.

'''[[Dedicated Server]]'''
*Exposed a new parameter for dedicated server. This will make the server more strict on entity interactions. Look in {{cd|[[server.properties]]}} for more information on what these do.
**{{cd|server-authoritative-entity-interactions-strict}} default to {{cd|false}} and can be set to {{cd|true}}. Will affect entity interaction acceptance.
*Removed {{cd|server-authoritative-movement}} parameter. It will now always use {{cd|server-auth-with-rewind}}.

'''General'''
*Server Authoritative movement is now turned on by default.

'''[[Particles]]'''
*Multiple controllers transitioning out of a state at the same time will now properly expire all intended particles instead of just the last one.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle.
=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
*{{cd|BlockMapColorComponent}} scripting API is now read-only.
*{{cd|BlockMapColorComponent}} scripting API fields {{cd|color}} and {{cd|tintMethod}} are now properties instead of methods.
*Deprecated {{cd|ItemUseOnBeforeEvent}} in {{cd|@minecraft/server 2.0.0-beta}}. Use {{cd|PlayerInteractWithBlockBeforeEvent}} instead.
*Deprecated {{cd|ItemUseOnAfterEvent}} in {{cd|@minecraft/server 2.0.0-beta}}. Use {{cd|PlayerInteractWithBlockAfterEvent}} instead.
*{{cd|BlockDestructionParticlesComponent}} API has been added to {{cd|@minecraft/server 2.0.0-beta}}.
*{{cd|EntityScaleComponent}} has been changed to read-only in version {{cd|2.0.0-beta}}.

'''Graphical'''
*Reduced emissive intensity by a factor of 15 in the Deferred Technical Preview, creators will likely need to adjust their emissive texture values.
*Adjusted air and fog densities for volumetric scattering for more visible light rays in Deferred Technical Preview.
*Made slight adjustments to auto exposure and eye adaptation in the Deferred Technical Preview.
