'''12w21b''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], released on May 25, 2012,<ref>{{mojangsnap|12w21b|May 25, 2012|Jeb}}</ref> which updates the [[Creative inventory]] and fixes some of the bugs and crashes from the [[12w21a]] snapshot.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Emerald Ore JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Emerald ore]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Emerald Ore JE1.png|32px]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Chunk]]s'''
* Saving and loading chunks is slightly faster.

'''[[Singleplayer]]'''
* Removed [[server.jar]] dependency in singleplayer.
:* This was included in the official changelog for the previous snapshot, but not actually implemented until this one.

'''[[Creative]]'''
* New [[inventory]] screen in Creative mode.
** [[Block]]s and [[item]]s are sorted by category, each category in its own tab, the categories are: "Building Blocks", "Decoration Blocks", "Redstone", "Transportation", "Miscellaneous", "Foodstuffs", "Tools", "Combat", "Brewing", and "Materials".
** The inventory can be searched for specific items: just start typing while in the inventory screen. The search results are displayed in the "Search Items" tab.
** The player's Survival mode inventory is accessible via a tab with the [[chest]] as its icon.
** Brewed [[potion]]s are not included in their own category.
** To close the new inventory window, the [[player]] must press <nowiki>'Esc' or 'Escape'</nowiki>. Using the default inventory key does not currently work.
** Added [[monster egg]] to Creative inventory.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* This version includes translation griefings.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|206015255132905472|Seems another griefed translation passed through. Wonder if BBC is going to call me this time, too. If this continues, I'm gonna be famous!}}</ref>
