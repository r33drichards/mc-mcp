'''''A Minecraft Movie''''' is a 2025 American adventure comedy film based on the video game ''[[Minecraft]]''. It is directed by [[Jared Hess]] and written by Chris Bowman, {{w|Hubbel Palmer}}, Neil Widener, Gavin James, and {{w|Chris Galletta}}, from a story by {{w|Allison Schroeder}}, Bowman, and Palmer.<ref name="WGACredit">{{citation|url=https://directories.wga.org/project/1235768/minecraft/|title=Minecraft - WGA Directory|website=WGA Directory|date=31 January 2025}}</ref>

Plans for the film originated in February 2014 when [[Markus Persson]] announced that the film was in development at [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. However, the film ultimately did not leave the pre-production phase until April 2022, when it was reported that Jared Hess was set to direct the film and [[Jason Momoa]] was attached to star. Further casting was announced between May 2023 and January 2024, with {{w|Principal photography|principal photography}} beginning that month and wrapping in April 2024.

''A Minecraft Movie'' had its {{AMCM|green carpet|premiere}} held at the {{w|Empire Leicester Square}} in London, England, on March 30, 2025,<ref>{{tweet|WarnerBrosUK|1899137596451926117|Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge & more are coming to London on March 30 for the World Premiere of #MinecraftMovie 🙌|March 10, 2025}}</ref> and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] on April 4, 2025.<ref name="Teaser"> {{ytl|PE2YZhcC4NY|A Minecraft Movie {{!}} Teaser|Warner Bros. Pictures|September 4, 2024}}</ref>

The film has received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but has been a box-office success, grossing $958 million worldwide against a budget of $150 million, making it the {{w|List of highest-grossing films based on video games|second-highest grossing film based on a video game}}, the {{w|List of American films of 2025|highest-grossing domestic film of 2025}}, and the {{w|2025 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest grossing film worldwide of 2025}}, subsequently making it Jared Hess' highest-grossing film to date.

A [[Untitled Minecraft film|sequel]] is in development and is slated to be released on July 23, 2027.

== Synopsis ==
{{Quote|Four misfits—Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry ([[Sebastian Eugene Hansen|Hansen]]), Natalie ([[Emma Myers|Myers]]) and Dawn ([[Danielle Brooks|Brooks]])—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like piglins and zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve ([[Jack Black|Black]]). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.|Warner Bros. Pictures and Mojang Studios<ref name="WarnerBros.Com"/>}}

== Plot ==
{{SpoilerWarning|section|''A Minecraft Movie''}}
Steve had a passion to explore the {{AMCM|mine}} since he was young, but wasn't allowed to do so with his young age. He settled for an office job years later, but feeling discontent, he remembered the mines and returned to them, finally able to explore. While mining, he came across the {{AMCM|Earth Crystal}} and the {{AMCM|Orb of Dominance}}; combining the two formed the {{AMCM|Earth Cube}}, which activated an {{AMCM|Earth Portal}}, in which he discovers the {{AMCM|Overworld}}. There, he tames and befriends a {{AMCM|wolf}} named {{AMCM|Dennis}} and becomes an expert builder. One day, Steve discovers an {{AMCM|obsidian gateway}} and, upon reactivating it, enters the {{AMCM|Nether}}. He encounters {{AMCM|Malgosha}}, the leader of the {{AMCM|piglin}}s, who despises creativity and has wished to demolish the Overworld for gold since being mocked at a talent show she joined in her childhood. Malgosha imprisons Steve and Dennis, who escape with the Orb of Dominance. Steve instructs Dennis to go to {{AMCM|Earth}} and hide the orb under his bed at home. Steve is imprisoned once again as Dennis escapes into Earth.

Years later, {{AMCM|Garrett Garrison}}, nicknamed "The Garbage Man" after becoming the {{AMCM|World Video Game Championship|video game champion}} of 1989, runs a store known as {{AMCM|Game Over World}} in {{AMCM|Chuglass}}, {{AMCM|Idaho}}, but receives an eviction notice. He heads to a storage unit that is said to hold an {{w|Atari Cosmos}}, hoping to sell it at his shop. Garrett wins the unit, but the Atari Cosmos is nowhere to be found. He trashes the unit before leaving, upset at his misfortune, but his car soon breaks down. Meanwhile, {{AMCM|Henry}} and {{AMCM|Natalie}} move into Chuglass following the death of their {{AMCM|Henry's Mother|mother}}. They meet their estate agent, {{AMCM|Dawn}}, who introduces them to their home. The next morning, Henry visits Game Over World before school and meets Garrett, who offers to mentor him. Upon arriving at {{AMCM|Chuglass High School}}, he is greeted by {{AMCM|Vice Principal Marlene}} and begins art class. He builds a {{AMCM|jetpack}}, which wows the students, but after being sabotaged by {{AMCM|Trevor}} and {{AMCM|Trevor's Friend|his friend}}, the jetpack goes haywire and crashes into the local {{AMCM|Chuglass Potato Chips|potato chip factory}}. Henry is nearly expelled, but Garrett pretends to be his uncle and picks him up. Back at Game Over World, Henry notices the Orb of Dominance and combines it with the Earth Crystal, dragging him to the mineshaft. Dawn and Natalie follow him and Garrett into the mineshaft, and they are all dragged through the portal into the Overworld. As they take in their surroundings, a {{AMCM|nitwit}} secretly goes through the portal and enters Earth.

Malgosha soon discovers that the Orb has returned, and frees Steve on the condition that he retrieves the Orb for her. He obliges, but attempts a sneak attack. Malgosha threatens to kill Dennis if Steve does not oblige, forcing him to reluctantly accept. Dennis then heads into the mineshaft, goes through the portal, and returns to the Overworld. Meanwhile, it becomes nighttime in the Overworld, and the {{AMCM|gang}} is attacked by numerous hostile {{AMCM|mob}}s. Garrett escapes through a tunnel underground, while Henry builds a house to protect him, Natalie, and Dawn. Garrett emerges beneath the surface and makes it to the house, but the cube is destroyed by a {{AMCM|skeleton}}'s arrow. The group are cornered by {{AMCM|zombie}}s but are soon rescued by Steve as it becomes daytime. He introduces himself and agrees to help the misfits return home, planning to do so by stealing another crystal from the {{AMCM|Woodland Mansion}}. Meanwhile, the nitwit gets hit by Marlene's car, and Marlene offers to take the nitwit out for dinner.

Upon arriving at {{AMCM|Midport Village}}, Steve introduces the group to the {{AMCM|villager}}s, and leads them to {{AMCM|Steve's Lava Chicken!}} and {{AMCM|Steve's Secret Stash!|his stash}}. In the Nether, Malgosha orders {{AMCM|General Chungus}} to lead an army into the village and kill the humans. In the Overworld, Steve introduces Henry and Garrett to the {{AMCM|crafting table}}, crafting an {{AMCM|iron sword}}. Garrett then crafts {{AMCM|Buck-Chuckets|two buckets connected to a chain}}, and Henry crafts a {{AMCM|tot launcher}} using items from Earth. As Dawn and Natalie meet the {{AMCM|cartographer}}, the village is attacked by General Chungus and his army. The humans get the upper hand and eventually escape, splitting up in the process. Steve, Henry, and Garrett escape with {{AMCM|elytra}} and are {{AMCM|Elytra Wingsuits Flying Escape|chased through the air}} by piglins and {{AMCM|ghast}}s. Dawn and Natalie attempt to craft a boat to follow the cartographer, but are unable to do so. Meanwhile, on Earth, Marlene goes on a date with the nitwit and expresses feelings towards him, which are reciprocated.

Steve, Garrett, and Henry then head for the {{AMCM|Redstone Mountains}}, with the woodland mansion just beyond them. Malgosha fires General Chungus, who is killed by the {{AMCM|Great Hog}}. Dawn and Natalie encounter Dennis and tame him, and Dawn asks Dennis to take them to Steve. In the Redstone Mines, Steve, Garrett, and Henry find Steve's stash of {{AMCM|diamond}}s, as Garrett secretly requested to Steve earlier that he may bring home diamonds to pay his debts. They are interrupted by the Great Hog and escape through a {{AMCM|minecart}} track, killing the Great Hog in Steve's {{AMCM|creeper}} farm. Henry and Garrett then get into a heated argument, while on Earth, Marlene and the nitwit are still having a dinner date.

Henry, Garrett, and Steve soon arrive at the woodland mansion. As previously planned, Henry retrieves the Earth Crystal to combine it with the orb, while Garrett and Steve distract the {{AMCM|illager}}s with a {{AMCM|Birthday Rap}} song. Henry eventually finds the crystal, but is attacked by an {{AMCM|enderman}}, all while Steve and Garrett are subjected to a fight with a {{AMCM|chicken jockey}}. After Henry defeats the enderman and the other two win the fight, the three escape. Outside, they are cornered by Malgosha and her army, who steals the orb and reveals she made a {{AMCM|New Hog}}. Henry and Steve escape on a lone ghast while Garrett sacrifices himself to hold off the piglins, seemingly being caught in a {{AMCM|TNT}} explosion. After Henry and Steve crash-land on grass, they are taken to the {{AMCM|Mushroom Safe House}} built by Dawn. Steve is happily reunited with Dennis while Henry and Natalie apologize and reconcile. Malgosha gives the orb to two piglins, who place the orb atop a giant Nether portal, blocking out the sun and spawning {{AMCM|Nether wart}} everywhere, thus beginning the {{AMCM|Great Darkening}}.

Steve, Henry, Natalie, and Dawn work together to stop the piglins, building {{AMCM|iron golem}}s to take down the army, while Steve faces Malgosha with {{AMCM|diamond armor}}. Henry heads up to the orb using an {{AMCM|ender pearl}} with his tot launcher, and Dawn sends Dennis and a pack of wolves after the piglins. Henry attempts to retrieve the orb, but is attacked by the New Hog. Garrett saves Henry using the ghast he hijacked and fires fireballs at the Nether portal, destroying it, and zombifying the piglins in the process. Retrieving the orb, the misfits are able to head back home. Steve allows Dennis to go live with Dawn, and after Natalie suggests that Steve head into the real world, he decides to join them. On Earth, Steve assists Garrett in creating a new arcade game, ''{{AMCM|Block City Battle Buddies}}'', and forms a band with him. Dawn leaves her real-estate job to start a petting zoo, and Natalie now leads a self-defense class. Henry arrives in school on his jet pack and is admired by fellow students.

In a mid-credits scene, Marlene and the nitwit get engaged, having learnt each other's languages.

In a post-credits scene, Steve heads back to his {{AMCM|149 Holly Oak Drive|home}} to retrieve his personal belongings from the attic. He is greeted by the current owner, a woman named {{AMCM|Alex}}.

Critics were divided on the film's plot and whether or not ''A Minecraft Movie'' was a faithful adaptation of the game, as well as if it made sense to viewers unfamiliar with it. Lovia Gyarkye of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and Jesse Hassenger of ''IGN'' both believed that the film's plot was confusing. Gyarkye felt that it struggled to maintain a balance between appeasing the ''Minecraft'' fandom and writing a film that made sense to a general audience, and Hassenger said that the film was "conceptually muddy" and "confusingly and erratically presented".<ref name=":8">{{citation |last=Gyarkye |first=Lovia |date=April 2, 2025 |title='A Minecraft Movie' Review: Jason Momoa and Jack Black Lead Unimaginative Video-Game Adventure Comedy |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20250404234852/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/ |archive-date=April 4, 2025 |access-date=April 5, 2025 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{citation |last=Hassenger |first=Jesse |date=April 3, 2025 |title=A Minecraft Movie Review |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250404031207/https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa |archive-date=April 4, 2025 |access-date=April 5, 2025 |work=IGN}}</ref> Mark Kennedy of the ''Associated Press'' believed that the film would likely make no sense to a viewer unfamiliar with the source material, but still believed that it was a faithful adaptation.

Some reviewers questioned the purpose or value of the film, with some viewing it as nothing more than a product with the intent of promoting ''Minecraft''.

=== Cinema reactions ===
{{See also|Movie:Chicken Jockey sensation}}
In theatres, fans would cheer whenever any of Black's lines from the trailer were said in the film, such as "''I am Steve''", "''Flint and steel!''", and most notably, "''Chicken jockey!''".<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1egn9y9ljno|title=Minecraft Movie sparks raucous reactions from fans|author=Helen Bushby|website=BBC News|date=April 8, 2025}}</ref> In one example of the latter, someone had brought in a live chicken to a screening in Provo, Utah, subsequently being removed from the showing.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/04/12/someone-provo-brought-live-chicken/|title=Provo fans brought a chicken to a ‘Minecraft’ screening and it went viral|author=Brock Merchant|website=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=April 12, 2025}}</ref>

Observers would later note that the reactions to the film were becoming a cultural phenomenon, comparing it to screenings of ''{{w|The Rocky Horror Picture Show}}'' and ''{{w|The Room}}''.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/minecraft-movie-cinema-trend-1.7503571|title=Chicken jockey!

On April 2, 2025, Jack Black, the actor for Steve, and Jason Momoa, the actor for Garret Garrison, were asked many questions in a Q&A for the movie. Black was asked if he would be playing [[Herobrine]] in a sequel. His response was "Dude, you want to know if there’s Hero Brian in the sequel? We don’t know. We don't know...

On April 4, 2025, Emma Myers and Sebastian Hansen told Yahoo UK how likely they thought a sequel would be. Emma said that she would love to do as many as they want, saying "Oh yeah, please. Minecraft 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 — as many as they'll have me in I would love to do!". Sebastain revealed that it would be  be "great [to] keep it going" but also is unsure how it could go about because of the way in which the movie tells a story entirely new to the world of the game so that means a potential sequel could go anywhere and do anything, which is an overwhelming concept.<ref>{{citation|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/movies/will-be-minecraft-movie-2-cast-sequel-interview-095306480.html|title=Will there be A Minecraft Movie 2?

== Trivia ==
* ''A Minecraft Movie'' was briefly shelved during its development.<ref>https://zerply.com/r/29FegFpw/minecraft-villager</ref>
* On Twitter/X, [[Jeb]] teased that the piglins in the movie survive in the Overworld by using {{AMCM|Nether wart}} in the same way as the {{MCL|piglin}}s from ''[[Minecraft Legends]]''.<ref>{{Tweet|jeb_|1833656219795681736|A movie teaser note: In Minecraft Legends the piglins used netherwart to survive the overworld...|September 10, 2024}}</ref>
* Jared Hess's reasoning of naming the film ''A Minecraft Movie'' as opposed to ''The Minecraft Movie'' was that "the game does not have a definitive way to play; there are an overwhelming amount of stories that can be told in ''Minecraft'', and he states that is simply one of those stories".<ref name="MCLive24"/>
* In the film, a snippet of "[[Minecraft (song)|Minecraft]]" by [[C418]] can be heard.
* When {{AMCM|Matty The Waitress}} asks {{AMCM|Marlene}} if she and Nitwit are "finished", Marlene responds, "No, I think he's Swedish." This is a reference to the game's studio originating and being situated in Sweden.
* In a workprint of the film, "{{Wikipedia|DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love}}" by Usher plays during the credits, notably being the same song remixed into the ''Minecraft'' pastiche "Revenge" by [[CaptainSparklez]] and TryHardNinja. The song is replaced by the original song "Zero to Hero" in the final cut.{{Citation needed}}
* During the Midport Village introduction scene, a {{AMCM|pig}} is seen wearing a crown, which Steve states is a "legend". This is a tribute to late YouTuber [[Technoblade]], who passed away from his battle with sarcoma cancer mid-2022. In a later interview, it was revealed that Sebastian Hansen, who plays {{AMCM|Henry}} in the film, was the one to suggest the reference.<ref>{{citation|url=https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/|title="There’s a Really, Really Sweet, Special Nod to Technoblade": 'A Minecraft Movie' Director Jared Hess on Tributes and Easter Eggs|author=Jake Weisman and Steven Weintraub|website=Collider|date=April 5, 2025}}</ref>
* During the enderman nightmare scene, Steve is shown with white eyes similarly to [[Herobrine]]. When asked about it, [[Torfi Frans Olafsson]] joked that it was unintentional.<ref>{{Tweet|torfi_F_Olafss|1908910433018491319|It’s super strange that all of their eyes were supposed to be purple but when it was rendered one of the characters eyes kept coming out white in the final rendered frames so we wound up keeping it like that, because the VFX studio ran out of time.|April 6, 2025}}</ref>
