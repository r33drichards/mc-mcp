{{relevant tutorial|Defeating a stronghold}}
A '''stronghold''' is an underground [[structure]] in the [[Overworld]], and is the only place where an [[End portal]] can be found. Strongholds can be located by using an [[eye of ender]].

== Generation ==
{{For|locating strongholds|Eye of Ender#Locating strongholds}}
[[File:EndPortalRoom.png|thumb|right|The [[End portal]] room]]

Strongholds generate at any Y level, mostly underground, and prefer to generate in [[biome]]s above sea level, but generate underwater if necessary. Strongholds may generate at [[bedrock]] level, cutting the bedrock.

Most parts of the stronghold can be overwritten by [[cave]]s, [[ocean monument]]s, [[Ancient City|ancient cities]], [[mineshaft]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[amethyst geode]]s, [[trial chambers]], and [[monster room]]s; but it is rare for the [[End portal]] to be replaced, which would force a player to find one of the other strongholds, as a portal can be activated only with all 12 [[End portal frame]]s present. [[Canyon]]s do not overwrite strongholds; rather, a stronghold can occasionally be found exposed by a canyon.<!-- verified in Bedrock 1.17.0, see talk page for examples -->

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{IN|Bedrock}}, strongholds generate randomly throughout the world and they are at least 160 blocks away from the world origin. There is no limit to the number of strongholds that can generate, unlike in ''Java Edition''. There are 3 extra strongholds at least 453 blocks away from the world origin, which tend to be close to the 453-block boundary, and are guaranteed to generate below meeting points of a [[village]].

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
[[File:Strongholds 1.9.svg|class=skin-invert-image|thumb|right|400px|Stronghold layout through the world {{in|Java}}]]
{{IN|je}}, all strongholds are located at random coordinates within rings in all biomes, where each ring is a certain radius from the center of the world (X=0, Z=0). For a given ring, the strongholds are generated at roughly equal angles from the center point of the world (for instance, each stronghold in a ring of 3 is in the region of 120 degrees from the others, measured from the origin). The game does not generate a stronghold partially above ground; any portion above the sea level is replaced with [[air]], leaving a cutaway. If a stronghold generates in an [[ocean]], which occurs rarely, it typically generates with terrain covered above it.

There are eight rings, containing 128 strongholds in total:
# The first ring has 3 strongholds within 1,280–2,816 blocks of the origin.
# The second ring has 6 strongholds within 4,352–5,888 blocks of the origin.
# The third ring has 10 strongholds within 7,424–8,960 blocks of the origin.
# The fourth ring has 15 strongholds within 10,496–12,032 blocks of the origin.
# The fifth ring has 21 strongholds within 13,568–15,104 blocks of the origin.
# The sixth ring has 28 strongholds within 16,640–18,176 blocks of the origin.
# The seventh ring has 36 strongholds within 19,712–21,248 blocks of the origin.
# The eighth and outermost ring has 9 strongholds within 22,784–24,320 blocks of the origin.
The number of strongholds in each ring is the [https://oeis.org/A000217 triangular number] of the number one more than the ring number, except for the outermost ring, where 45 would be expected.

The outermost ring has the further unusual property of putting the strongholds at angles of roughly 36° (not the expected 40°) as if there were to be ten equally spaced strongholds, like in the third ring. One of these ten does not generate, however, keeping the number at nine.

{{Main|/Structure}}
[[File:Stronghold isometric view.png|thumb|An isometric view of a stronghold in a [[superflat]] world.<ref group="n">In superflat worlds, strongholds generate with the maximum number of rooms possible.</ref>]]

Stronghold generation starts with a spiral staircase room that leads down to a five-way intersection. From there, additional rooms are randomly generated. The layout can extend up to 50 rooms away from the original room and within a horizontal radius of 112 blocks.{{info needed|From which room is the 50 rooms count measured: the spiral staircase or the five-way crossing? From which block is the horizontal radius measured: the top, bottom, or center of the starting room?}} If no portal room is generated during this process, the stronghold generation restarts.

Doors are the separating sub-structures that generate between the various rooms of strongholds. There are 4 types of door: the empty opening, the grate of iron bars, the wooden door and the iron door. The iron door variant is exlusive to {{JE}}.<ref name="irondoors">{{bug|MCPE-11765|MCPE-11765|No iron doors and stone buttons in strongholds}}</ref>

They are generated randomly, with each having an equal chance of appearing, except for the empty opening which is twice as likely to occur.

In order to prevent two doors from generating directly adjacent to each other, they are generated only as room entrances.

Wooden and iron doors always face the direction in which the stronghold generates: a door that is flush with the wall always leads away from the starting staircase, while a door that is indented into the wall leads toward it.

| Five-way crossing<br><small>(minecraft:sh5c)</small>
| This room consists of a small atrium from which 2 to 6 paths can branch out:
* The first exit (1), located in front of the stairway, always generates, as it acts as the entrance to the room.
* The second exit (2), located down the stairway, always generates.
* The other exits (3, 4, 5, and 6) each have a 50% chance to generate.{{more info|According to Stronghold/Structure, the "far exit to the right" has a 66% chance; however "right" is meaningless as the room can be flipped.}}

<gallery>Stronghold five-way crossing layout.png|The layout of a five-way crossing</gallery>

This room can branch out to hidden rooms. If the room is rotated such that the player faces west or north when entering it, a hidden room tries to generate. Hidden rooms always attempt to generate directly adjacent to indentations on the same wall; the attempt can sometimes fail meaning no hidden room generates.

Each air block within 4 blocks above the ground (inclusive) has a 7% chance of being replaced by a cobweb upon generation.

Between 0 and 2 libraries can generate per stronghold. Additionally, libraries can never generate within four rooms of the starting staircase.

| Portal room<br><small>(minecraft:shpr)</small>
| The End portal room is the only room guaranteed to generate in a stronghold. It never generates within five rooms of the starting staircase, although it is less likely to generate farther away.

Unlike all other rooms in the stronghold, it always generates with a complete outer wall, making it the only room that is consistently fully formed after generation.

Each portal frame has a 10% chance to generate containing an [[eye of ender]]; the average number of portal frames found prefilled is 1.2. The chance of the portal being completely pre-filled is one in a trillion (1:1,000,000,000,000 or 10<sup>-12</sup>).

Its entrance is always the door variant made of iron bars.

As of [[Java Edition 1.16]], all [[world seed]]s that have a pre-activated End portal in the first ring have been found.<ref>{{citation|url=https://github.com/hube12/SSGOutput/releases/tag/1.1|title= 1.16 12-eye seeds with spawn locations Latest|website=github.com|author=hube12|date=September 14, 2020}}</ref>
