'''CommuniKate''', real name simply '''Kate,'''<ref>{{YouTube link|PLdzGkHSXZsgFP|Best of Kate and Zed {{!}} Minecraft Mini Series {{!}} Mattel Action!|Mattel Action|February 8, 2018}}</ref> is a character and the "host" of the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]''. Desperate to create the next big reality game show with her co-host, [[Zed]], she teleports other characters from their biomes to participate. She is voiced by [[Lydia Winters]].

== Appearance ==
CommuniKate is a white skinned woman with pink hair, outlined with yellow highlights. Underneath purple lensed sunglasses, she has green eyes. She wears a purple, sleeveless shirt, white pants, and yellow shoes.

== Personality ==
Driven first and foremost by her ego, CommuniKate is mad with power and willing to do anything that gives her TV ratings. On the surface, she can appear bubbly and theatrical, when in truth she uses this facade to manipulate victims into taking her bribes. When the contestants attempt to defeat her, she shows an unnatural amount of foresight, successfully tricking them into thinking they had the upper hand and using a rigged book of [[commands]].

However, she is not without weakness, suffering from alektorophobia, the fear of chickens. She also appears to lack any defensive capabilities, being easily overpowered by Poseidon and struggling to battle mobs when forced to participate in his show.

== Biography ==
As a little girl, CommuniKate was cast in the role of a chicken in a school play, which was poorly received by critics, traumatizing her for many years.<ref>{{YouTube link|7rocJpC9blE|Stagecraft {{!}} Minecraft Mini Series: Season 2 {{!}} Episode 5|Mattel Action|May 3, 2018}}</ref> When she grew up, CommuniKate worked on several reality TV shows for [[Mojang Studios]], including ''America's Next Top Villager'' and ''So You Think You Can Craft''.<ref>{{YouTube link|oNYgRzJ6lUQ|The First Night {{!}} Minecraft Mini Series {{!}} Episode 1|Mattel Action|October 26, 2017}}</ref> Using this momentum, she convinced Poseidon to help fund her a reality game show, where various challengers would compete in games across the Spooky Isles to the whim of a [[Command Block (Mini-Series)|command block]].<ref>{{YouTube link|rZzqpAQQh38|Poseidon's Game {{!}} Minecraft Mini Series: Season 2 {{!}} Episode 1|Mattel Action|May 22, 2018}}</ref>
Then, with the launch of the show, she teleported 10 heroes (2 per 5 biomes) and began giving them tasks, for the completion of which the team that completed the task first was given a reward. During the penultimate test, the participants of the show release chickens on Kate, take the book from her command block and build she with Zed with obsidian. The heroes begin sending each other home, but they end up on the [[Greek Isles]], where they are soon teleported show hosts. At the beginning of the second season, Poseidon betrays Kate and Zed, and forces the former show hosts along with Durango and Quinn to bring him 5 [[Enchanted Ender Eye]]s. After some time, the heroes bring Poseidon the eyes, and the heroes try to stop him. But Poseidon turns on the self-destruction of the command block statue. Kate tries to stop the self-destruction, but nothing works. Soon Zeus comes, stops Poseidon and asks the heroes to help him. After helping Zeus, it is unknown what happened to Kate and Zed.
