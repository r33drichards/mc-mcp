* [[Pre-classic]], the first private development phase of ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{link|url=https://archive.org/download/Minecraft_IRC_Logs_2009/history/files/May-15-to-June-03-2009/2009-05-16.075419-0400EDT.txt.~1~|title=TigIRC logs|date=May 16, 2009, UTC–4|website=Archive.org|quote=(12:07:06) notch: minecraft alpha is available.
