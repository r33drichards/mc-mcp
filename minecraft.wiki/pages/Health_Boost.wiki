'''Health Boost''' is an unused [[status effect]] that increases maximum health of an entity.

== Effect ==
Adds {{hp|4}} maximum health per level. Unlike [[Absorption]], the added hearts are empty at first, but can be healed through the usual methods (such as natural regeneration and the [[Regeneration]] and [[Instant Health]] effects). Health of any entity is capped at {{hp|1024}} and extra health provided by Health Boost can't exceed that, so for players, maximum health is reached at Health Boost level 251.

Extra hearts of a mounted [[mob]] can be seen while riding it.

When the effect ends, any extra health is lost. {{IN|java}}, losing this extra health causes the player's view to jolt as if taking damage, even in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode.

== Cause ==
Health Boost can be obtained only by executing {{cmd|effect}}.

== Immune mobs ==
[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Health Boost.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The maximum [[health]] the [[player]] can achieve using Health Boost and Absorption is {{hp|2048}}.
* Applying a high level of this effect and Regeneration to a tamed [[wolf]] makes its tail rotate several times, because tamed wolves' tails rotate upward to indicate current health, with no upper bound.
