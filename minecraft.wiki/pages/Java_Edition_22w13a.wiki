'''22w13a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on March 31, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w13a|March 31, 2022}}</ref> which adds the [[allay]], [[ancient cities]], [[reinforced deepslate]], and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Reinforced Deepslate JE1.png|32px]] [[Reinforced deepslate]]'''
* A new block only found in [[ancient cities]] shaped as a large frame.
* Is not craftable.
* Is completely blast-resistant, and takes an incredibly long amount of time to mine (82.5 seconds).
* Can be broken, but won't drop anything, even with [[Silk Touch]].
* Cannot be moved with pistons.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Allay Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Allay spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Allay JE2.gif|32px]] [[Allay]] '''
* Can collect the same items from the world as it holds in its hand.
* If holds an item it got from a player, it follows that player.
** It can be made to hold an item by interacting with the allay (pressing {{control|use}}).
** The item can also be removed by interacting with the allay (pressing {{control|use}}) while with an empty hand.
* Able to drop items at nearby [[note block]]s, and stay close to a note block that has been played near them.
* If they have items in their inventory, they attempt to give them to their owner.
** When playing a note block near them, that note block becomes their favorite one for 30 seconds, and they attempt to drop off items at the note block rather than at the player.
* Sometimes spawn in cages next to [[pillager outpost]]s (similar to [[iron golem]]), and inside [[woodland mansion]]s.
* Has a delay for picking new items after delivering items.
* Immune to damage from its owner while holding an item.
* Have {{hp|10}} health points.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Ancient City SE.png|32px]] [[Ancient city]]'''
* Generates within the [[deep dark]] biome and includes all of the deep dark features within it.
* Always generates at Y=-51.
* Made of [[deepslate]] and its variants, [[basalt]] and its variants, and [[gray wool]].
* Contains [[soul sand]], [[soul fire]] and [[soul lantern]]s, as well as [[candle]]s and [[skeleton skull]]s.
* Contains chests with unique loot, like the [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment.
** Other valuable loot includes the "[[otherside]]" music disc, potions of [[Regeneration]] II, [[enchanted book]]s, enchanted iron and diamond [[leggings]], enchanted diamond [[hoe]]s, and [[enchanted golden apple]]s.
** If the frame of [[reinforced deepslate]] generates with a chest in front, it always contains one [[golden carrot]] (a hint about how to open the secret door below).
** Has different levels and open spaces, with several types of ruins and wall structures.
** Some of these structures contain [[dark oak log]]s, [[planks]], and [[fence]]s; cyan, light blue, and blue wool and [[carpet]]s; [[ladder]]s; [[ice]] and its variants; [[note block]]s; [[stone pressure plate]]s; and [[iron trapdoor]]s opened with [[lever]]s.
* Hidden underneath the frame of reinforced deepslate are several rooms containing redstone mechanisms that serve to introduce new players to their function.
** There is a silenced sculk sensor that needs a signal strength of 8 to open a redstone door. Taking the golden carrot from the chest placed near the structure and eating it reveals the entrance.
** Each variant of the city center has a different redstone puzzle concealing the entrance, requiring slightly different strategies to solve.
** The mechanisms are made with [[redstone dust]], [[redstone torches]], [[redstone repeater]]s, [[redstone comparator]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, [[blocks of redstone]], [[sticky piston]]s, a [[sculk sensor]], a [[target]], and a [[lectern]].
** One variant includes a lever, and another includes a [[furnace]] containing 24 [[deepslate]] and a [[wooden shovel]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added three new advancements:
** Bukkit bukkit
*** Catch a [[tadpole]] in a [[bucket]]
** It spreads
*** Kill a mob near a [[sculk catalyst]]
** With our powers combined!
*** Have all [[froglight]]s in your inventory

*** {{nbt|list|player}}: a player for which this trigger runs.
