[[File:Ore UI - Play Screen "Worlds" Tab - Play World Button - Experimental Tag Example (Bedrock).png|thumb|300px|Example of a world with the experimental tag on ''Bedrock Edition''.]]
'''Experiments''' (also known as '''Experimental Gameplay''' or '''Experimental Features''' {{in|BE}}) are [[data pack]]s {{in|JAVA}} or game options {{in|BE}}. When an experiment is enabled, it allows players to test some experimental, unfinished, or work-in-progress features that may or may not eventually be released in future updates.
[[File:Experimental World Java.png|thumb|width=360x360|Example of a world with the experimental tag on ''Java Edition''.]]

== Toggling ==
Experiments are found in the world options when creating or editing{{only|be}} a world. When turning an experiment on an existing world, a copy of the world is created automatically. {{IN|Bedrock}}, turning an experiment on disables [[achievements]] for the world. Once the world is created with an experiment on, the experiment cannot be turned off again. Worlds with the experiments on have an "Experimental" tag next to the game mode name in the world menu.

=== Servers ===
Experiments can be enabled for servers by editing the {{Cd|server.properties}} file{{Only|java}} before generating a world by adding the ID of the experiment to the {{Cd|initial-enabled-packs}} field in the form of a comma-separated list.

For example, this is how you can enable [[Minecart Improvements]] in {{Cd|server.properties}}:
 initial-enabled-packs=vanilla,minecart_improvements
Features may be enabled retroactively to already existing worlds by editing the {{Cd|level.dat}} file in a specialized editor.{{Info needed}}

== Warnings ==
[[File:Ore UI - Play Screen or Edit World Screen - Play World Button - Load Experimental World Pop-Ups (Bedrock).png|380px|thumb|The warning message that pops up when attempting to play on an experimental world on in ''Bedrock Edition''.]]
The point of experiments is for the player to look at some not-quite-finished or experimental features, which could crash, break, change, or stop working at any point in future updates. When the player attempts to load the experimental world, it shows a warning message before loading it. Attempting to disable the experiments toggle via external tools could also crash and break the world.

It is recommended to create backup copies of the world before enabling any experiments to avoid breaking the world and having issues in future updates.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
[[File:Experiments.png|alt=Experiments screen on ''Java Edition''.|thumb|The experiment selection screen on ''Java Edition''.]]
