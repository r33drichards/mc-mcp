'''Trial Chamber Legends''' is a  [[Marketplace]] map developed by Starfish Studios, created to demonstrate features introduced in the ''[[Tricky Trials]]'' update and ''[[Armored Paws]]'' drop.

== Summary ==
The map opens on a cutscene of the Village Archeologist and their [[allay]], hurdling inside of a [[trial chamber]] to escape an active sandstorm. Pulling out a [[torch]], the archeologist will begin to search the chambers, before encountering a [[breeze]]. Subsequently, the breeze traps the allay in a cage, scaring the archeologist away, who promises to come back to free them.

After the cutscene, the player will gain control, where the archeologist asks the player to rescue the allay in the chamber. The player will then enter through a dark entrance.

Inside, the player will find a modified version of the first entrance to the chambers, with chests containing various [[weapons]], [[armor]], and [[shields]]. Heading into the chamber the allay was trapped inside, the player will find two [[trial spawners]], which spawn [[zombies]] and [[husks]]. Once defeated, a breeze will spawn through a third trial spawner. Once the breeze is defeated, the allay will instruct the player pick up a breeze rod, and craft a [[wind charge]]. The player will then throw the wind charge at the allay's cage to free them. Once freed, the allay will lead the player out of the chamber and into a room with a "Warp Stone", enabling them to return to the [[village]]. 

Upon exiting the chambers, the left third of the mural above the trial chambers will become filled in. The player will then climb up a large staircase, where a cutscene will begin. This cutscene, led by the allay, introduces the player to the town of Breezy Peaks. This cutscene shows the player four of the quests, as well as the Village Quest Board. Once the cutscene finished, the allay instructs the player to go to the Village Quest Board, to see if anyone needs their help. Here, the player will be given the Info Book and Village Map. At the Village Quest Board, players can select various quests to play. Five are available, those being "The Armadillo Roundup", "Bakery Repair", "Trial Chambers Exploration", "Copper Bulb Conquest", and "Wind Charge Bootcamp".
=== The Armadillo Roundup ===
The quest starts with a cinematic, once the player has gone up to Amber. It shows [[zombie]]s with leather helmets and occasionally a leather chestplate wandering around her farm. It then shows her armadillos in various different locations. 

Once in the barn, she will give you a bone to tame a wolf, with all nine variants present. A little sign appears over each of them, giving a brief description of where the variant can be found. 

[[File:Trial Chamber Legends Armadillo breeding.png|thumb|A pair of armadillos breeding.]]
After taming your wolf, Amber will give you in your inventory six [[armadillo scute]]s, to craft a set of [[wolf armor]] on a crafting table placed in the center of the barn. A crafting recipe will appear above the crafting table, signaling how to craft it. Once crafted, you must put equip your wolf with the armor.

Amber will give you thirty-two [[spider eyes]] to attract the armadillos. The player must then kill the thirteen zombies found across the farm. The armadillos must be all rounded up in the outside pen before Amber continues on and gives you the task to breed them. The two pairs must be bred using the spider eyes, making the total of armadillos six. The remaining spider eyes will disappear from the player's inventory.

[[File:Trial Chamber Legends BP Statue Wolf.png|thumb|The wolf statue in the town center.]]
With that, a statue of a wolf appears in the player's inventory, to be placed at the town center.

=== Bakery Repair ===
The Baker is in a cutscene while making some [[cake]], then the player comes by and he said that his bread making machine isn't working. He asks the player to make a [[crafter]], while giving them the ingredients of a crafter (1 [[crafting table]], 1 [[dropper]], 5 [[iron ingot]]s and 2 [[redstone dust]].) Then once the crafter is created, it should be placed on the red [[glazed terracotta]], which then you will have interact with it to only activate the middle row. Once done, place [[wheat]] in the middle row, which can be found in the [[chest]]s. Once the lever is pressed, the crafter crafts [[bread]] and the quest ends, with the "Statue of Kindness" in the player's inventory.

=== Trial Chambers Exploration ===
The first task has a modified atrium room with two chests with armor, shields and weapons and over is a large, tall room with a central pillar, ladders and some [[copper grate]] platforms hanging on [[chain]]s. On the central pillar is a trial spawner that spawns [[zombie]]s (although the trial spawner is similar to the bogged's) and killing the zombies lead you to a ladder with wide bridges and [[spider]] trial spawners with a vault on the corners. Going through is a round room with a warp stone, leading to the next challenge or to return to the village.

The second task has the same modified atrium room, with a corridor connected through. One bogged trial spawner generates through, a copper door leads to a small room with a vault and another to a hallway with a vault and a modified intersection room with a chest with the same armor-like loot, one side is a room with wide bridges and spider trial spawners, and another has a large room with a central pillar with a bogged trial spawner. One side of the room may contain a round room with the warp stone.

=== Copper Bulb Conquest ===
{{Expand section}}
In the architect’s house you’ll see a crafting recipe for copper bulbs:

{{Crafting
|B1 = Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper; Matching Waxed Block of Copper
|A2 = Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper; Matching Waxed Block of Copper
|B2 = Blaze Rod
|C2 = Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper; Matching Waxed Block of Copper
|B3 = Redstone Dust
|Output = Matching Unwaxed Copper Bulb, 4; Matching Waxed Copper Bulb, 4
|ignoreusage=1
}}

=== Wind Charge Bootcamp ===
{{Expand section}}
Drill Sergeant appears and then grants the player wind charges.

When you run out of wind charges, the Drill Sergeant will give you 64 more.

You can also talk to the [[allay]] to get [[Jump Boost]].

Drill Sergeant says: Looks like these jumps are challenging, huh? Talk to me if you need some more.

When you finish the parkour course, you will see a crafting recipe for the Mace:

{{Crafting
|ignoreusage=1
|B1 = Heavy Core
|B2 = Breeze Rod
|Output = Mace
}}

And there are combat dummies you have to hit in time. 

If not, then it will say:

Whoops! Try to hit the combat dummy before you land!

== Issues ==
There is a bug that sometimes occurs in the Copper Bulb Conquest that causes the oxidizing sequence to not occur, thus making it incompletable. 

== Trivia ==
* Above the Trial Chamber is a mural, featuring the [[MCL:Well of Fate|Well of Fate]], [[MCL:Gather Allay|gather allay]], and [[MCL:Build Allay|build allay]] from ''[[Minecraft Legends]]''. This was confirmed to be an intentional [[easter egg]] by one of the developers.<ref>{{tweet|TheLambOficial|1808265469926814062|Seems someone put a little easter egg in the map.|July 2, 2024}}</ref>
* The [[Ominous Trial Spawner|ominous trial spawner]] in the key art uses the regular [[Trial Spawner|trial spawner]]'s active texture, albeit with a blue flame.
