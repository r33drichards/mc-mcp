{{Missing information|world history.}}
A '''world''' or '''level''' is an individual ''Minecraft'' "universe" which encompasses all [[Block|blocks]] and [[entities]] in each [[dimension]]. Worlds can be accessed and edited through the [[world selection menu]] from the [[main menu]] and can be created with the "[[Create New World]]" button.

== Description ==
Worlds are split into three [[dimension]]s, which are in turn composed of [[block]]s of various sizes, usually either cubic or composed of one or more cuboids, or of flat plane images, all of which are arranged in [[wikipedia:Cubic honeycomb|a Euclidean grid]]. [[Fluid]]s, [[entities]] and [[particles]] also exist within these worlds, and certain locations of the world can possess [[biome]]s and different levels of [[light]]. Blocks and entities can possess other attributes such as [[item]]s, [[effect]]s and, by extension, [[enchantment]]s. The terrain of world is [[World generation|procedurally generated]] before [[players]] can modify blocks and entities within. Various [[structure]]s and [[features]] can also generate inside worlds, sometimes containing [[chest]]s with [[chest loot|loot]] inside.

A player can manage settings for gameplay and world generation before world creation in the [[Create New World]] screen, and after creation through [[game rules]] and the [[edit world]] screen.{{Only|be|short=1}} Worlds can be generated with several [[world types]], and there are generation options for the [[world seed]] and the [[Bonus Chest|bonus chest]]. From the world options, the player can manage the world file, including duplicating, deleting, exporting (to transfer the world or upload to a [[server]]),{{Only|be|short=1}} and uploading to [[Realms]]. Worlds can be modified using [[resource packs]], [[data packs]],{{Only|je|short=1}} [[behavior packs]],{{Only|be|short=1}} and [[experiments]]. World content can be created efficiently using projects in ''[[Bedrock Editor]]''.

== Storage ==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{main|Java Edition level format}}
Each world is saved in its own separate folder in the <samp>[[.minecraft]]/saves</samp> folder. Files relating to [[chunk]]s in the Overworld are stored in the base world save folder, Nether files are stored in the <samp>DIM-1</samp> subfolder, and End files are stored in <samp>DIM1</samp>. Each dimension has its own {{cd|data|poi|region|d=and}} folders that is stored in its directory.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{See also|Bedrock Edition level format}}
Each world is saved in its own separate folder in the <code>[[com.mojang]]/minecraftWorlds</code> folder. This world folder can be compressed into a <code>.zip</code> file, which can be changed into a <code>.mcworld</code> file to tranfer the world. Exporting worlds on Windows devices automatically zips the world in a <code>.mcworld</code> file, which can be imported on non-console devices by opening the file with the ''Minecraft'' app, or using the import world feature in the [[play]] screen.

==== World template ====
A world file can be converted to a world template to easily modify its contents, such as add-ons and additional languages for the world name, in order to let a player create a new world with data stored in the template.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/createaworldtemplate?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Create a World Template from an Exported World|website=Microsoft Learn|date=December 5, 2023}}</ref> A world template uses the same directory structure as regular world files, with a few additional JSON files.<div class="treeview">
* {{File|directory|''internal world ID''}}
** {{File|file|[[manifest.json]]}}: Mandatory file, must specify {{Cd|"world_template"}} type. Contains the name and ID of the world. If the name and description are set to {{Cd|pack.name}} and {{Cd|pack.description}}, these will be assigned the texts specified in the localization files. Optionally, {{Cd|"allow_random_seed" : true}} can be added to the header to override seeds stored in the world data and generate a new world with a random seed.
** {{File|directory|texts}}
*** {{File|file|languages.json}}: Specifies all languages used.
*** {{File|file|''languagecode''_''COUNTRYCODE''.lang}}: A language file for localization. Multiple language files can be used.

===== Localization =====
The in-game name and description of the world template can be changed for any [[language]]. The LANG file should contain {{Cd|1=pack.name=}} followed by the name of the template, and {{Cd|1=pack.description=}} followed by the description. {{Cd|languages.json}} should contain an array of all language codes used.[[File:Ore UI - Play Screen "Worlds" Tab - Create From Template Button Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The "Create from..." screen.]]

===== Importing =====
A finished world template can be zipped and packaged as a {{Cd|.mctemplate}} file. Opening this file will automatically import it as a world template, stored in {{Cd|com.mojang/world_templates}}. World templates can also be imported on Windows in the "Create from..."  screen opened after pressing the "Create new world" button in the [[play]] screen.

All imported world templates are shown in the "Create from" screen. Selecting a world template will show the description, and opening it will open the [[Create New World]] screen with all data from the world template.

World templates can also be purchased from the [[Marketplace]]. A list of Marketplace and [[Marketplace Pass]] world templates is shown in the "Create from..." screen, which can create a world similar to custom world templates.
