}}'''Theseus''' is the son of Poseidon, and reluctant co-host of the second season of [[Minecraft Mini-Series|''Minecraft Mini-Series'']]. Although appearing obedient to his father, he is constantly working behind his back to free his captives and take down the show.

== Appearance ==
Theseus wears a grey T-shirt, blue striped shorts and brown sandals. He has medium brown hair and blue pupils.

== Personality ==
Theseus is shown as a calm, well meaning person who helps others. However, he remains in service to his father, keeping up a front to gain information and opens opportunities to unravel the conspiracy. Even while rebelling, he appears somewhat awkward and ill prepared, struggling to find ways to explain that his father is an imposter, not an actual god.

== Biography ==
Theseus when walking near the meeting place of Poseidon and [[CommuniKate]] met his father, and suspected him of something bad. He watched his father, and realized that his father wants to take over the overworld, and the show is just a cover. Theseus begins to secretly help the heroes, until Poseidon gets his eyes. Then Theseus, along with other heroes, tries to stop his father, and even fights him on fish, but to no avail. Soon Zeus comes, stops Poseidon and asks the heroes to help him. The further fate of Theseus is unknown.

== Relationships == 
=== Poseidon ===
Theseus and Poseidon had a good family relationship, even though Poseidon turned out to be a villain, Theseus did not want to fight him.
