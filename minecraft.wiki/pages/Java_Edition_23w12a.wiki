'''23w12a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20]] released on March 22, 2023<ref>{{snap|23w12a|March 22, 2023}}</ref>, which adds [[calibrated sculk sensor]]s, [[sniffer egg]]s, [[suspicious gravel]], [[trail ruins]], more [[armor trim]]s and [[pottery shard]]s, and new [[sign]] mechanics.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Calibrated Sculk Sensor JE1.gif|32px]] [[Calibrated sculk sensor]]'''
* A type of [[sculk sensor]] which does not generate naturally and allows players to filter vibrations based on their frequency level. 
* Can only be crafted with one sculk sensor and three [[amethyst shard]]s in the [[crafting table]].
* One side of the calibrated sculk sensor can receive a [[redstone]] signal as an input.
* Emits light level of 1.
** The [[Redstone circuits|strength of that redstone signal]] is the only vibration frequency the calibrated sculk sensor listens to.

'''[[File:Pitcher Plant JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Pitcher plant]]'''
* A type of [[plant]] which grows from the [[pitcher pod]] after 4 stages (5 stages in total).
* Can be obtained by breaking a fully grown pitcher crop.
* Can be crafted into a [[cyan dye]].
* Cannot be placed in a [[flower pot]].

'''[[File:Sniffer Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Sniffer egg]]'''
* Can be found in the [[suspicious sand]] generated in warm [[ocean ruins]].
* Also dropped when two [[sniffer]]s breed.
* Hatches into a snifflet.
** When placed on a [[moss block]], it hatches after approximately 10 minutes.
** On all other blocks, it hatches in approximately 20 minutes.

'''[[File:Suspicious Gravel BE1 (dusted 0).png|32px]] [[Suspicious gravel]]'''
* The suspicious gravel looks rougher than the [[gravel]] block.
* Affected by gravity and vanishes when landing.
* Drops nothing when mined or moved, even if mining with [[Silk Touch]].
* Generates naturally in cold [[ocean ruins]].
* Brushing the suspicious gravel with a [[brush]] extracts objects.
** Has four stages of extracting and recovers gradually when stop brushing.
** Turns to regular gravel when the extraction is done.
** Only suspicious gravels with a valid archaeological loot table (the ones naturally generated) can extract an item.

=== Items ===
'''{{Animate|Pitcher Crop Age 0 JE1 BE1.png; Pitcher Crop Age 1 JE1 BE1.png; Pitcher Crop Age 2 JE1 BE1.png; Pitcher Crop Age 3 JE1 BE1.png; Pitcher Crop Age 4 JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Pitcher pod]]'''
* Can be planted on farmland and grows into a pitcher plant.
* Can only be obtained if a sniffer digs up a pitcher pod.
* Drops pitcher plant when fully grown, otherwise drops itself.

Definitely gonna be a challenge to get!|March 22, 2023}}</ref>

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Trail Ruins.png|32px]] [[Trail ruins]]'''
* A buried [[generated structure]] from a lost culture.
* Generates in [[taiga]]s, [[snowy taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s (both types), [[old growth birch forest]]s, and [[jungle]]s. 
* Comprised of a tower, a path across the bottom, and a few additional rooms attached to the side.
* Contains [[suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]], as well as [[mud bricks]] and several colors of [[terracotta]] and [[glazed terracotta]].
* Four [[armor trim]]s and seven [[pottery shard]]s can be found here.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>combination_step_sound_blocks</code> block tag.
** Contains {{cd|d=and|#wool_carpets|crimson_roots|moss_carpet|nether_sprouts|snow|warped_roots}}.
** Controls which blocks can produce a combination of step sounds.
* Added <code>has_structure/trail_ruins</code> biome tag.
** Contains {{cd|d=and|taiga|snowy_taiga|old_growth_pine_taiga|old_growth_spruce_taiga|old_growth_birch_forest|jungle}}.
* Added <code>sniffer_egg_hatch_boost</code> block tag.
** Contains <code>moss_block</code>.
* Added <code>trail_ruins_replaceable</code> block tag.
** Contains {{cd|d=and|sand|gravel|dirt|coarse_dirt}}.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Block of amethyst]]'''
* Added a new behavior called "vibration resonance" when it is placed adjacent to [[sculk sensor]]s.
** If that sculk sensor receives a vibration, the block of amethyst re-emits its frequency as a separate vibration at its location.

'''[[Decorated pot]]'''
* Added a new property named <code>cracked</code>.
** Is used to determine the sounds the block use upon breaking.

'''[[Sculk sensor]]'''
* Vibration frequencies of many actions in the game have been tweaked and greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference, as following:
 {| class="wikitable"
! Action
! Frequency value
|-
| Movement in any medium (land, water and air)
| 1
|-
| Landing on any surface (land or water)
| 2
|-
| Item interactions
| 3
|-
| Gliding with an elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roar, Wolf shaking, etc)
| 4
|-
| Dismounting a mob or equipping gear
| 5
|-
| Mounting a mob or interacting with a mob
| 6
|-
| Mobs and players getting damaged
| 7
|-
| Consuming items (drinking and eating)
| 8
|-
| Blocks 'deactivating' (door close, chest close, button unpress, etc)
| 9
|-
| Blocks 'activating' (door open, chest open, button press, etc)
| 10
|-
| Blocks changing (cauldron water level rising, adding food to campfire, etc)
| 11
|-
| Blocks being destroyed
| 12
|-
| Blocks being placed
| 13
|-
| Mobs and players teleporting or spawning
| 14
|-
| Mobs and players dying or an explosion
| 15
|}

'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Text can now be edited by {{control|interacting}} with it after being placed in the world.
** Previous [[dye]] and [[glow ink sac]] effects are kept after editing.
* Both sides of the sign can now have separate text and colors.
** By default, a sign prompts the player to input the front side's text when placed.
** To apply text to the back-side, the player must walk to the other side and interact with that face to edit it.
* Signs can now also be waxed with [[honeycomb]], preventing any further edits to its text.
** Click commands on signs can only be invoked when the sign is waxed.
** If a sign with a click command is not waxed, interacting with it doesn't invoke the command and instead opens up the edit screen as usual.

'''[[Suspicious sand]]'''
* Now generates naturally in warm [[ocean ruins]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Potion]]s'''
* [[Wither effect]] particle colors have been adjusted to make them more distinguishable.
* Potion of [[Slow Falling]] has had its color tweaked to make it more distinguishable from the potion of [[Invisibility]].

'''[[Smithing template]]s'''
* The dune armor trim now has a new pattern and smithing template icon.
* The sentry armor trim now uses dune armor trim's old pattern and has a new icon to fit this pattern.
** The sentry armor trim's old pattern is now used by the new shaper armor trim.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Ocean ruins]]'''
* Now include [[suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]] blocks.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]]'''
* Previous values are now always discarded if <code>interpolation_duration</code> is 0.
* Made sure that render properties are applied at the same time (so <code>block_state</code> is applied at the same time as transformation, i.e. at next tick after receiving update).
* Entities are not rendered unless initial data is received. That means display entities might not show on the first [[tick]].
** Due to how game handles updates, changes to entities made after summoning might be delivered to clients with later tick.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* The data pack version is now <code>13</code>, accounting for sign data format changes.

'''Feature flags'''
* Removed <code>update_1_20</code> feature flag and built-in datapack.
** All features and changes from the "Update 1.20" experimental pack are now part of the game.

'''Game events'''
* <code>piston_contract</code> game event has been removed in favor of <code>block_deactivate</code>.
* <code>piston_extend</code> and <code>dispense_fail</code> game events have been removed in favor of <code>block_activate</code>.
* Many game events have new vibration frequencies:
 {| class="wikitable"

| 15
|}

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Step sounds can now combine for blocks walked through and stepped on.
** Occurs for [[carpet]]s, [[snow]], [[nether sprouts]] as well as [[Warped Roots|warped]] and [[crimson roots]].
*** The top-most block the player is walking on is played as normal.
*** The block underneath is played at a lower volume and pitch.

'''[[Custom structure|Structure]] Post-processors'''
* A <code>capped</code> post-processor has been added which can limit how many blocks a delegated post-processor randomly transform in a structure.
** This can be used to configure a structure piece to have an exact amount of specific blocks, instead of using random distribution.
** It has following required parameters:
*** <code>delegate</code> - A post-processor which performs the actual block transformation.
*** <code>limit</code> - Maximum amount of blocks that the delegated post-processor can transform.
**** The blocks inside a structure are all randomly passed to the delegated post-processor until it has transformed the limited amount.
**** Either constant or random number generator sampled during post-processing.
* Previously a rule could specify an optional fixed <code>output_nbt</code> which would be added to the processed output block entity; this field has now been changed to reference a <code>block_entity_modifier</code>.
** Existing <code>block_entity_modifier</code>s are:
*** <code>passthrough</code>: Retains existing fields on the block entity.
**** This is the default if no <code>block_entity_modifier</code> is specified.
*** <code>append_static</code>: Similar to previous <code>output_nbt</code> this provides fixed fields to add to the block entity.
**** A minor change is that this modifier appends configured fields to the processed block instead of replacing existing fields.
*** <code>clear</code>: Removes any existing fields on the block entity.
*** <code>append_loot</code>: Appends a loot table and seed to the block entity through required parameter:
**** <code>loot_table</code>: Referenced loot table to add to block entity as <code>LootTable</code> field.
**** Field <code>LootTableSeed</code> is also added to the block entity using random seeded by block position.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the [[cherry grove]] to the <code>is_overworld</code> biome tag.
* Added {{cd|d=and|wayfinder_armor_trim_smithing_template|shaper_armor_trim_smithing_template|silence_armor_trim_smithing_template|raiser_armor_trim_smithing_template|host_armor_trim_smithing_template}} to the <code>#trim_templates</code> item tag.
* Added {{cd|d=and|angler_pottery_shard|blade_pottery_shard|brewer_pottery_shard|burn_pottery_shard|danger_pottery_shard|explorer_pottery_shard|friend_pottery_shard|heart_pottery_shard|heartbreak_pottery_shard|howl_pottery_shard|miner_pottery_shard|mourner_pottery_shard|plenty_pottery_shard|sheaf_pottery_shard|shelter_pottery_shard|snort_pottery_shard}} to the <code>#decorated_pot_shards</code> item tag.
* Removed {{cd|d=and|moss_carpet|snow|nether_sprouts|warped_roots|crimson_roots|#wool_carpets}} tags from the <code>#inside_step_sound_blocks</code> block tag.
