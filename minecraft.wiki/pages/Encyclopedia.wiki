The '''Encyclopedia''' is a guide in the [[How to Play]] screen describing many of the game's mechanics. This page documents every encyclopedia entry.

== Overworld A-Z ==

=== Armor ===
By wearing Armor, you can protect yourself from incoming damage. Your [[Armor#Armor points|Armor level]] is represented by {{Armorbar|2}} on the HUD, the higher the level, the less damage you will take.

==== Crafting ====
Armor can be crafted from [[Leather]], [[Iron Ingot|Iron]], [[Gold Ingot|Gold]], or [[Diamond]]. [[Chainmail Armor]] can be obtained through [[Trading|villager trading]] and loot from [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s.

Equip Armor by opening your [[inventory]] and moving pieces of Armor to the appropriate slot next to your player skin.

Iron, Chain, and Gold Armor can be [[smelt]]ed into [[Iron Nugget|Iron]] or [[Gold Nugget]]s in a [[Furnace]].

==== Shield ====
The [[Shield]] will block incoming damage. The Shield can be equipped in the [[Dual wield|offhand slot]] as well as the [[hotbar]]. Press and hold SHIFT to block with the shield.

The Shield can even block a [[Creeper]] explosion!

==== Disguise ====
You can also wear a [[Carved Pumpkin]] on your head. This won’t give you any {{Armorbar|2}} but will make it so [[Endermen]] won’t get mad when you look at them.

=== Armor Stand ===
An [[Armor Stand]] holds your armor when you aren't using it.

==== Outfitting ====
Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on an Armor Stand while holding a piece of armor to place it on the Armor Stand.

Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on an Armor Stand with an open hand to remove something from the Armor Stand.

==== Posing ====
An Armor Stand can change its pose, sneak and press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on an Armor Stand to change the pose.

==== Dancing ====
Armor Stands will react to a Redstone signal, try giving it different signal strengths and see what happens.

=== Banners ===
[[Banner]]s are a cool way to decorate your house or castle with custom patterns and colors.

After crafting a Banner, you can put it on a Crafting Table or [[Loom]] and add different dyes to create your own unique, cool design!

==== Applying a Pattern ====
There are many different patterns that you can create with your dye such as:

* Making a triangle gives you a chevron pattern.
* Making a cross gives you a cross pattern.
* Adding a [[Oxeye Daisy]] gives you a flower pattern.

Experiment with different combinations to get even more patterns!

==== Multiple Layers ====
A Banner can also have multiple layers, allowing you to have more than one pattern on your Banner. If you don't like the last pattern you put on a Banner, you can wash the last layer off in a [[Cauldron]].

==== Making Copies ====
If you want to copy a Banner, put it on the Crafting Table with a blank Banner.

=== Beacons ===
Active [[beacon]]s project a bright beam of light into the sky.

They are crafted with [[Glass]], [[Obsidian]], and [[Nether Star]]s (which is obtained by defeating the [[Wither]]).

==== Construction ====
Beacons need to be on top of a Pyramid of [[Block of Iron|Iron]], [[Block of Gold|Gold]], [[Block of Emerald|Emerald]], [[Block of Diamond|Diamond]] or [[Block of Netherite|Netherite]] blocks with an unobstructed view of the sky.

The material that the Beacon is placed on has no effect on the power of the Beacon.

==== Use ====
In the Beacon menu you can select one primary power for your Beacon. The more tiers your pyramid has the more powers you can have.

To set the powers of your Beacon you must use a [[Netherite Ingot]], [[Emerald]], [[Diamond]], [[Gold Ingot]], or [[Iron Ingot]] in the payment slot.

Once set, the powers emanate from the Beacon indefinitely. Powers are granted to all nearby players.

To change the color of the beam, place a [[stained glass]] block in its path.

=== Beds ===
Sleeping in a [[Bed]] passes the night and sets your spawn point.

Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on a Bed to go to sleep. This can only be done at night.

If you are playing Multiplayer, everyone in the world must be in a Bed at the same time to pass the night.

If your bed is broken you return to where you first spawned into the world.

Be careful when using a bed in [[the Nether]]; it's usually too hot to sleep.

=== Blocks ===
The world of ''Minecraft'' is made from millions of [[block]]s. Each one is breakable, collectable, and placeable. There are almost no limits to what you can build!

Most blocks you will have to find in the world, but some can only be crafted such as combining other blocks on a crafting table like a [[Redstone Block]] or smelted in a [[furnace]] like [[Glass]].

==== Falling Blocks ====
Most blocks are not affected by gravity and can float in mid air, but some like [[Sand]] and [[Gravel]], will fall if there is no block underneath them.

==== Interesting Blocks ====
Here are some examples of the more interesting blocks in ''Minecraft'':

* [[Glass]] - This is a transparent block that is made by smelting [[Sand]] in a [[Furnace]].
* [[Concrete]] - This is made by dropping a [[Concrete Powder]] block into water.
* [[Terracotta]] - This is found naturally in [[Badlands]] biomes or can be crafted and dyed from [[Clay]] that is found underwater. [[Terracotta]] can be made into [[Glazed Terracotta]] by smelting it in a Furnace.
* [[Magma]] - This is found naturally in the Nether, it gives off a little light and will burn whoever steps on it.
* [[Coarse dirt]] - This is almost like a normal [[Dirt]] block but Grass can't grow on it. It can be found in [[Windswept Savanna]] and [[Old Growth Taiga]] biomes.

=== Book and Quill ===
The [[Book and Quill]] lets you record your adventures. Tell your story by entering text into the pages. You can even change the title and the author! Sign the Book and Quill to finalize your work. The Book and Quill will be editable until it is signed.

=== Chests ===
Once you have crafted a [[Chest]], you can place it in the world and then open it with [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to store items from your inventory.

Items in the Chest are stored there for you to put into your inventory later.

Two chests placed next to each other will be combined to form a [[Large Chest]].

=== Conduits ===
An active [[Conduit]] gives you powers when you are underwater and when it rains.

A Conduit is crafted with [[Nautilus Shell]]s and a [[Heart of the Sea]]. The Conduit draws power from [[Prismarine]] and [[Sea Lantern]]s.

==== Construction ====
Once activated, a Conduit will grant [[Conduit Power]] to anything nearby.

The more power it draws in, the further its abilities reach.

=== Dyes ===
[[Dye]] is used to change the color of many things in ''Minecraft''.

Some Dye materials are harder to find than others. Most Dyes can be crafted from [[flower]]s, like [[Red Dye]] from a [[Poppy]], but some Dyes are found or created in more obscure ways such as:

* [[Black Dye]] - Collecting [[Ink Sac]]s from [[Squid]]s

* [[Blue Dye]] - Mining [[Lapis Lazuli]] deep underground
* [[Brown Dye]] - Harvesting [[Cocoa Beans]] in the [[Jungle]]
* [[Green Dye]] - Smelted from [[Cactus]]
* [[White Dye]] - Crafted from [[Bone Meal]]

=== Farming ===
There are a variety of different [[crops]] that you can farm in ''Minecraft''. Farming, while challenging, can provide an infinite food source.

==== Plan Ahead ====
Crops require [[light]], [[water]], and [[farmland]] to grow. You need a [[hoe]], a water source, and [[seeds]] to farm.

The Blocks next to the water need to be converted to farmland, do this with the hoe. Water will saturate up to four blocks away.

==== Planting and Harvesting ====
Now you can plant your seeds. Make sure your crops are protected as they can easily die from being trampled or lack of water or light.

[[Fence]]s can help protect your crops from hungry [[rabbit]]s or trampling toes!

When the crops are fully grown they change in appearance and can be harvested.

Some plants like [[pumpkin]]s and [[melon]]s grow on stalks. Be careful not to harvest the stalks!

=== Fireworks ===
Fireworks are a fun way to create your own unique celebration in ''Minecraft''!

Fireworks have two components, the [[Firework Rocket]] and the [[Firework Star]].

==== Firework Rocket ====
To use a Firework, press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on a block to send the Firework shooting into the sky.

Fireworks have no effect other than shooting into the sky.

==== Firework Stars ====
Firework Stars can be added to during the crafting of the Firework Rocket to give it many different colors and effects.

Firework Stars are made from [[gunpowder]] and various other items!

* Color - Adding [[dye]] of any color will make an explosion of that color.
* Twinkle - Adding [[Glowstone Dust]] will make the explosion twinkle.
* Creeper Shaped - Adding a [[Creeper Head|Head]] will make a [[creeper]] pattern in the sky.
* Burst - Adding a [[feather]] will give explosion a burst effect.
* Trail - Adding a [[Diamond]] will give the explosion trails.
* Star Shaped - Adding a [[Gold Nugget]] will make a star shape in the sky.

==== Pyrotechnics ====
Fireworks can be fired from a [[dispenser]]. This will shoot the Firework in the direction that the dispenser is facing.

=== Fishing ===
Fishing must be done with a [[Fishing Rod]] and is an excellent way to catch some [[fish]] or other cool items from the sea.

==== Casting ====
Aim at a block of water and press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] while holding a fishing rod to cast the lure into the water.

==== Fish On! ====
Wait until you start to see a trail of bubbles coming for the lure.

When the bubbles touch the lure, it will bob up and down. Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to reel in the lure. Be careful not to let your fish get away!

=== Jigsaw Blocks ===
[[Jigsaw Block]]s give creators the ability to generate large [[structure]]s in the world by connecting multiple structure templates.

==== How to Obtain ====
To get a Jigsaw Block you must use the {{command|/give}} slash command. To use the Jigsaw Block, you must have Operator [[permissions]].

==== Settings ====
Jigsaw Blocks have multiple settings that control how they join together to form a larger structure.

* Target Pool - The path of the target pool to search for a connecting structure template. The template pool should contain at least one structure that matches the Jigsaw's "Target Name" field.
* Name - The name of the Jigsaw. This is used when connecting from Jigsaws with a matching "Target Name".
* Turns Into - The type of the block the Jigsaw Block will turn into when placed in the world during structure generation.
* Selection Priority - When the parent piece is being processed for connections, this is the order in which this Jigsaw Block attempts to connect to its target piece. Jigsaws will be processed in descending priority with random ordering breaking ties.
* Placement Priority - When this Jigsaw Block connects to a piece, this is the order in which that piece is processed for connections in the wider structure. Pieces will be processed in descending priority with insertion order breaking ties.
* Joint Type - A joint can be either Rollable (default) or Aligned. If the joint type is Rollable, the target structure will be rotated randomly around the source Jigsaw Block. If the joint type is Aligned, the target structure will be placed such that the rotation of the target Jigsaw Block aligns with the rotation of the source Jigsaw Block. Note that this only applies when the Jigsaw Block is placed facing up or down.

=== Mounts ===
A player can ride any adult [[Horse]], [[Donkey]], [[Mule]], or [[Camel]]. Only Horses can be armored.

Mules and Donkeys may be equipped with saddlebags (for transporting items) by attaching a [[Chest]]. These saddlebags can then be accessed whilst riding or sneaking.

==== Taming ====
Horses, Donkeys, and Mules must be tamed before they can be used. A player can tame a horse and staying on it while it tries to buck them off. Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] with an empty hand to tame Horses, Donkeys, and Mules.

When hearts appear around the horse, it has been tamed and will no longer try to knock the player off.

==== Riding Animals ====
To steer a horses and camels, the player must equip it with a [[Saddle]].

Saddles can be bought from [[villager]]s, found inside Chests hidden in the world, or acquired by [[fishing]]. While riding a horse, open your inventory and put a saddle in the horse's saddle slot.

A camel can carry two players at the same time.

Horses and donkeys can be bred like other animals using [[Golden Apple]]s or [[Golden Carrot]]s.

Foals will grow into adult horses over time, although feeding them [[Wheat]] or [[Hay bale|Hay]] will speed this up.

==== Pack Animals ====
[[Llama]]s are another ridable mob which can be tamed and used to transport large shipments of items.

Llamas can be tamed the same as horses. However, even when tamed, the player can't control their movements while riding.

A [[lead]] can be attached to one, and when this happens, surrounding llamas (both tamed and un-tamed) will follow, making a caravan.

Llamas can be equipped with chests, giving it 3-15 slots of inventory space depending on the strength of the Llama. They can also be equipped with [[carpet]]s. Each carpet color yields a different pattern.

==== Pigs ====
Pigs can be ridden as well, although they won't go where you want without a little incentive.

Equip a pig with a Saddle and point a [[Carrot on a Stick]] in the direction you want to go.

==== Dismount ====
Press SHIFT to dismount.

=== Navigation ===
Navigation is an important skill that you must learn in ''Minecraft'', because it's not always easy to find your way home.

First of all, there are some basic tools that you should know about.

==== Navigation Tools ====
A [[Compass]] will point in the direction of the first place you spawned into the world, an easy way to find where you started.

A [[Map]] lets you see the area you've explored. Put it in your offhand slot to use it like a mini-map. You can increase its size by adding more paper to the edges in a Crafting Table.

A [[Locator Map]] will show you where you are and what direction you are facing in relation to the Locator Map's origin. It also shows you the location of other players in the same world.

A [[Cartography Table]] can help you create, expand, copy and even name maps.

Place [[paper]] into the first slot to craft a Map. If you add a compass into the second slot you can craft a Locator Map. Adding Paper or a blank Map will let you expand or copy your Map.

==== Navigation Techniques ====
Try to watch for landmarks as you explore. The more you play on a world, the more you will be able to remember where you are. Another good trick is to place [[Torch]]es as you go so that you may find your way back home.

The [[sun]] can also tell you what direction you are facing. Remember: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west!

==== Explorer Maps ====
There are several places for you to explore. Find a village and look for a [[Cartographer]]. He will trade you [[Explorer Map]]s that will lead you to strange places far away.

=== Nether Portal ===
A [[Nether Portal]] allows you to travel to a different dimension.

If constructed correctly the Nether Portal can be lit and activated.

Example of a portal construction shown here:
[[File:NetherPortal.png|center]]

=== Pets ===

==== Befriending Pets ====
There are several mobs in ''Minecraft'' that you can tame and make your pets. Each can be tamed by giving them an item that they like. Once tamed you can have them stay by pressing [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] while looking at them.

==== Wolves ====
[[Wolves]] are a neutral mob that hunt in the colder climates. They will attack [[Rabbit]]s, [[Skeleton]]s, and [[Sheep]] but run away from [[llama]]s. They won't attack you unless you provoke them. You can tame them by giving them [[Bone]]s.

==== Cats ====
[[Cat]]s are a neutral mob that can be found in [[village]]s. They will attack Rabbits and Baby [[Turtle]]s. They also keep [[Phantom]]s and [[Creeper]]s away. They will try to run from you so taming them can be tough. They like fish so give them [[Raw cod|Raw Cod]] or [[Raw salmon|Salmon]] to tame them.

==== Parrots ====
Parrots are a passive mob that live in the [[Jungle]]. They will imitate any other mob in the area. [[Seeds]] are their favorite, give them a few to tame them. Parrots will also sit on your shoulder... Yes, you can have more than one up there.

=== Raids ===
While exploring the world you may encounter a [[Pillager]] [[Pillager Outpost|encampment]] or [[patrol]]. Pillagers are always looking for villages to raid. Taking their Banners will get their attention, and they may choose to attack a nearby village.

Be sure to defend your village, the attack will stop when you defeat all the raiders.

==== I Need A Hero ====
Villagers are most likely to be grateful when you have saved them from the raiders. Be sure to check back with them, you might get a good deal.

=== Ranching ===
In ''Minecraft'', you can have your own ranch filled with livestock! Ranching provides lots of resources such as [[wool]], [[egg]]s, and raw meat.

==== Growing Your Herd ====
In order to keep your livestock growing, you have to make baby animals. Adult animals must enter Love Mode for this to happen. Feed the animals their preferred food to get them to enter [[Love Mode]].

When two like animals are nearby and in Love Mode, they kiss for a moment and then a baby animal will appear! The baby animal will stay with their parents until they grow into an adult. After having a baby, adult animals must wait 5 minutes before entering Love Mode.

==== What Do Mobs Eat? ====
[[Cow]]s, [[Mooshroom]]s, and sheep all eat [[Wheat]]. [[Pig]]s can eat [[Carrot]]s or [[Beetroot]]. [[Chicken]]s love Seeds of any kinds. Rabbits will eat Carrots, [[Golden Carrot]]s, or [[Dandelion]]s. [[Ocelot]]s enjoy [[Raw cod|Raw Cod]] or [[Raw salmon|Salmon]]. Wolves like to eat any kind of meat.

Animals will follow you when you hold their desired food item. This will help you lead them to your ranch or another animal.

=== Scaffolding ===

==== Reach For The Sky ====
[[Scaffolding]] can help you create huge structures safely! You can walk inside scaffolding and stand on it. You can travel upward by standing in the scaffolding and pressing SPACE. If you want to travel downward you can press SHIFT.

==== Support Your Build ====
Scaffolding needs support. You can place only so many scaffolding horizontally without touching a different block. When you attempt to place too many scaffolding blocks without proper support, it will fall. Scaffolding can be placed like normal blocks, but it can also be placed on its own foundation to quickly build a tall tower.
[[File:How_to_Play_Scaffolding.png|center|frameless]]

==== Break It Down ====
When Scaffolding is broken, it will also break every Scaffolding block that was being supported by it. This will let you quickly clean up your scaffolding by breaking only the supporting blocks!

=== Structure Blocks ===
[[Structure Block]]s give creators the ability to copy and save out sections of their world into structures. Saved structures can then be pasted back into the world.

==== How to Obtain ====
To get a Structure Block you must use the {{command|give}} slash command. To use a Structure Block, you must have Operator permissions.

==== Modes ====
Structure Blocks have 4 modes that can be switched between with the Mode dropdown: Save, Load, Corner, and 3D export.

Save mode saves an area of the world as a structure.

Load mode loads a structure into the world. Only structures saved in the world or included in a behavior pack that is applied to the world can be loaded.

Corner mode is used with save mode's detect button to automatically set the area you want to save. See the Corner Mode section below for more details.

3D Export exports a 3D model file on supported platforms.

==== Preview Window ====
On the right side of the Structure Block screen, a preview of the area you have selected or the structure to load will appear depending on the mode the block is in.

Press [[File:Left_Button_emoji.png|width=28x28]] and drag, to rotate the 3D preview.

==== Redstone Activation ====
[[Redstone]] can be used to activate a Structure Block. This will cause it to either save a structure out or load a structure into the world, depending on the mode of the block and its settings.

==== Integrity and Seed ====
You can change how much of the structure is loaded in by changing the values for Integrity and Seed.

Integrity - the percentage of blocks to load in from the structure, accepted values are 0 to 100. Blocks will be chosen randomly if a Seed is not specified.

Seed - the value entered here will determine which blocks to remove when using Integrity. Leave this field blank if you want the blocks to be chosen randomly.

==== Structure Void Blocks ====
When a structure with [[Structure Void]] blocks is loaded into the world, any block that would have been removed where the structure void block is loading into, will instead stay in the world.

Example: loading an empty shipwreck into the bottom of the ocean will normally copy air over the water blocks. If the shipwreck was filled with structure void, then the water will stay, and you will have a shipwreck filled with water.

==== Detect and Corner Mode ====
To automatically select the area you want to save, you can place Corner Mode blocks around your structure and name them with the save name as the structure you want to save.

Pressing the Detect button in Corner Mode will find all of the Corner Blocks with the same name and create a selection so that it will save everything inside of the volume those Corner Blocks make.

=== Tools ===
There are many tools in ''Minecraft'' that will allow you mine blocks faster than your fist. Tools can be crafted from [[Wood]], [[Stone]], [[Iron]], [[Gold]], [[Diamond]], or [[Netherite Ingot|Netherite]].

Using the right tool for the job will not only mine that block faster, but will also cost less durability. More complex tools must be created in order to mine rarer resources.

==== Tools that Break Stuff ====

* The [[Pickaxe]] is good at breaking hard blocks like [[Cobblestone]], [[Iron Ore|Iron]], or [[Furnace]]s.
* The [[Axe]] is good at breaking wooden blocks like [[Log]]s, [[Planks]], or [[Crafting Table]]s.
* The [[Shovel]] is good at breaking loose blocks like [[Dirt]], [[Sand]], and [[Gravel]]. Shovels can also create a [[Dirt Path|path]] by pressing [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on grass blocks.
* The [[Hoe]] is required for tilling Dirt to plant [[crops]]. Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on Dirt or Grass blocks to turn them into [[Farmland]].

==== Other Tools ====
There are even more tools to aid you on your adventure:

* A [[Bucket]] will allow you to collect things like [[Water]], [[Milk]], [[Lava]], and even [[Fish]].
* [[Flint & Steel]] allows you to light fires... be careful in densely wooded areas!
* A [[Fishing Rod]] lets you catch fish and other loot from water blocks. It can also be used to pull other players and mobs. Fishing Rods can also be [[enchanted]]!
* [[Shears]] are very handy for collecting items like [[Wool]], [[Leaves]], and [[Cobweb]]s.

=== Transportation ===
There are many ways to get around other than walking or riding a mount or flying.

==== Minecarts ====
[[Minecart]]s are ridable carts that roll on [[Rail]]s. You can make the Rails go wherever you want by placing them next to each other. Place a Minecart on the Rails and you are ready to ride.

==== Boats ====
[[Boat]]s let you travel across water. Place one on a water block and you are ready to go.

=== Villager Trading ===
[[Trading]] can be done in [[village]]s. Each [[villager]] has a profession; they can be [[Farmer]]s, [[Butcher]]s, [[Blacksmith|Blacksmiths]], [[Cartographer]]s, [[Librarian]]s, or [[Cleric|Priests]]. Some professions trade for items that other professions cannot. Explore and trade with many villagers to find all the trades.

==== Goods for Emeralds ====
You can find out what a villager is offering as trade by interacting with them. A villager may adjust the price of a trade whenever a player trades with it. A villager may run out of stock, temporarily disabling the trade if it is used too frequently. Trades usually involve buying or selling items for [[emerald]]s.

As you trade with villagers, they will get better at their profession and start to offer better and more valuable trades.

Take care of your villagers, they need to rest, work, and eat to thrive.

=== Weapons ===

==== Sword ====
The [[sword]] is the primary melee weapon in ''Minecraft''. It can be made from [[Wood]], [[Stone]], [[Iron]], [[Gold]], [[Diamond]], or [[Netherite Ingot|Netherite]]. Jump attacks do critical damage!

Press [[File:Left_Button_emoji.png|width=28x28]] with a Sword in your hand to attack.

==== Bow ====
The [[Bow]] is the primary ranged weapon in ''Minecraft''. Press and hold [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to draw the bow back. Release [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to fire an arrow. The bow requires [[arrow]]s to fire.

Bows do more damage the further they are pulled back, make sure to pull it all the way back.

==== Crossbow ====
The [[crossbow]] is an alternate ranged weapon. Press and hold [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to load the crossbow. Once the Crossbow is loaded, it will stay loaded until it is fired. Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to fire an arrow. The Crossbow requires arrows to load.

==== Trident ====
The [[Trident]] is a dual-purpose melee and ranged weapon. Press [[File:Left_Button_emoji.png|width=28x28]] to attack. Press and hold [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to draw the trident back. Release [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to throw the trident. The Trident is the best weapon underwater.

==== Enchanted Weapons ====
The Sword, Bow, Crossbow, and Trident have specific enchantments that you can get from the [[Enchanting Table]] or [[Anvil]] that will improve damage, durability, and even light mobs on fire!

== Stands & Tables ==

=== Anvil ===
[[Experience]] Levels can be used to repair, enchant, or rename items with the [[Anvil]].

==== Renaming and Applying Enchantments ====
All items can be renamed, although only items with durability can be repaired or enchanted with [[Book]]s on the Anvil.

==== Repairing ====
An item can be repaired by placing it in one of the input slots on the left, along with either some raw materials of the item, like [[Iron Ingot]]s for an Iron Sword, or combined with another item of the same type.

Combining items is more efficient when done with an Anvil.

There is a chance that the Anvil will be damaged with each use and after enought<!--is this an editor typo or is it like this in game?--> usage it will be destroyed.

=== Brewing Stand ===
Brewing [[potion]]s requires a [[Brewing Stand]]. Every potion starts off with a [[bottle of water]], which is made by filling a [[Glass Bottle]] with water from a [[Cauldron]] or water source.

==== Know your Brewing Stand ====
A Brewing Stand has three slots for creating different potions. One ingredient can be used over all three bottles, so always brew three potions at the same time to best use your resources.

==== Ingredients and Potions ====
Putting [[Nether Wart]] in the top position of the Brewing Stand will give you an [[Awkward Potion]]. This doesn't have any effect by itself, but creates a base potion that can be used to create more advanced potions.

There are many potion effects to discover, experiment with different ingredients and combinations to become a true alchemist.

=== Cauldron ===
The [[Cauldron]] is a container that can hold buckets or bottles of liquid.

==== Filling ====
Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on a Cauldron while holding a [[Bucket of Water]] or a Potion to fill the Cauldron with its contents.

A [[Potion]] will only partially fill a cauldron, so you will have to use multiple Potions to fill it up completely.

==== Dipping Arrows ====
Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on a Cauldron with your [[Arrow]] in your hand to create all kinds of different arrows.

==== Dyeing Armor ====
To dye [[Leather]] [[Armor]] or [[Leather Horse Armor]], press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on a Cauldron filled with water while holding the desired [[dye]]. This will change the color of the water inside of the Cauldron. Then dip your armor into the Cauldron by pressing [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] with armor in your hand.

If you want to wash the dye off, dip the dyed item into a Cauldron of undyed Water.

=== Crafting Table ===
The [[Crafting Table]] will let you craft more complicated recipes.

Place it in the world, then press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on the Crafting Table to use it.

=== Enchanting Table ===
The [[Experience Points]] collected by picking up [[Experience Orbs]] can be used to enchant [[Weapon]]s, [[Armor]], [[Tool]]s, and [[Book]]s.

==== Enchanting ====
When an enchantable item is placed in the slot below the book in the [[Enchantment Table]], the three buttons to the right of the slot will display some enchantments with their Experience Level cost and [[Lapis Lazuli]] cost.

The actual enchantment applied is randomly selected based on the cost displayed.

==== Stronger Enchantments ====
If the Enchantment Table is surrounded by [[Bookshelves]] (up to a maximum of 15), with a one block gap between the Bookshelf and the Enchantment Table, arcane glyphs will be seen going to the book on the Enchantment Table and the potency of the enchantments will be increased.

==== Enchanting Books ====
[[Enchanted Book]]s are used at the [[Anvil]] to apply enchantments to items. This gives you more control over which enchantments you would like on your items.

=== Furnace ===
A [[Furnace]] allows you to cook or smelt items. For example, you can smelt [[Iron Ore]] into [[Iron Ingot]]s.

Place the furnace in the world and press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] to use it.

;

You need to put some fuel into the bottom of the Furnace, and the item that you want smelted in the top. The Furnace will then fire up and start working. Lots of things can be used as fuel; try experimenting with anything burnable!

=== Loom ===
The [[Loom]] is a fast and efficient way to apply [[Banner Pattern|patterns]] to [[Banner]]s. The Loom only uses one Dye to apply a pattern. It can also use Loom patterns to apply special patterns.

==== Weaving ====
By placing a Banner into the Loom's first slot, and any color dye into the second slot, patterns can be added to the Banner. Once a pattern is selected, take it from the output slot on the right and move it to your inventory.

A Banner can have multiple layers allowing you to experiment with many different banner possibilities. Up to 6 patterns can be applied to a Banner to create a unique design.

==== Loom Patterns ====
Adding a Loom Pattern to the loom's third slot allows the crafting of special patterns like a [[Creeper Charge Banner Pattern|creeper face]] or a [[Flower Charge Banner Pattern|flower pattern]]. You will not lose your Loom Patterns when you apply these patterns to your Banners.

=== Smithing Table ===
Want to get the most out of your equipment? You'll need a [[Smithing Table]].

Use it to make all kind of changes, for example by upgrading Diamond equipment to Netherite, or by making cosmetic changes with Armor Trims.

==== Smithing Templates ====
In order to upgrade your equipment, you'll need a [[Smithing Template]]. You can find a large variety throughout the world, which can be used for all kinds of upgrades.

Place a Template into the leftmost slot of a Smithing Table to see which items you need for the upgrade.

For example, to upgrade Diamond equipment to Netherite, you need a [[Netherite Upgrade]] Smithing Template, which you can find in [[Bastion Remnant]]s. Then, place the Diamond equipment in the equipment slot and a Netherite Ingot in the ingredient slot, and you're done!

Item properties such as enchantments and armor trims will be retained, but the Smithing Template will be consumed when you upgrade your equipment. Don't worry - you can craft copies of them with your Crafting Table.

==== Armor Trims ====
Get creative and customize the look of your armor with Armor Trims. You'll need an Armor Trim Smithing Template to get started, which you can find throughout the world.

Place a Template into the leftmost slot of a Smithing Table to see which items you need for the upgrade. Then place a piece of armor in the equipment slot and a crystal or ingot in the ingredient slot. Done!

Only certain crystals and ingots can be used for Armor Trims. Try different kinds like [[Iron Ingot|Iron]], [[Gold Ingot|Gold]], or [[Lapis Lazuli|Lapis]] to create unique designs!

== Redstone Engineering ==

=== Droppers ===
When powered by [[Redstone]], [[Dropper]]s will drop a single random item contained within. Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on the Dropper to open it and then you can load it with items from your inventory.

==== Usage ====
If a Dropper is facing a [[Chest]] or another type of container, the item will be placed into that instead. Long chains of Droppers can be constructed to transport items over a distance.

=== Dispensers ===
[[Dispenser]]s are used to shoot out items. You will need to power each Dispenser with a redstone signal (for example, with a lever) to trigger it.

To fill a Dispenser with items, press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on the Dispenser, then move the items that you want to dispense from your inventory to the Dispenser.

==== Usage ====
Whenever you power a Dispenser, an item will shoot out.

Dispensers can also be used to place items as well, such as [[Carved Pumpkin|Pumpkins]] on [[Iron Golem]]s and equipment on [[Armor Stand]]s.

=== Hoppers ===
[[Hopper]]s are used to automatically move items. Hoppers can be attached to some other items like containers such as Chests or Jukeboxes.

Hoppers will continuously remove items out of a container placed above them and move them into the container they are pointing to.

==== Usage ====
To make a Hopper point to a particular block, place the Hopper against that block while sneaking.

If a Hopper is powered by Redstone, it will become inactive and stop moving items.

=== Jukebox ===
The [[Jukebox]] will play [[Music Disc]]s that you have found.

==== Get the Party Started ====
Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] on a Jukebox with a Music Disc in your hand to play it. Press [[File:Right_Button_emoji.png|width=29x29]] the Jukebox again to eject the Music Disc.

==== Redstone ====
When a Jukebox is playing a Music Disc, it will power [[Redstone Dust]].

Try different Music Discs for a different power level.

See what happens when you let it play to the end.

A Hopper can put a Music Disc in for you, and take it out when it's done playing.

==== Finding Music Discs ====
There are a couple of Music Discs that can be found in Chests around the world.

Others are more difficult to come by; Creepers secretly appreciate music.

=== Redstone ===
[[Redstone Dust]] comes from Redstone that transmits an electrical signal. When it has power it lights up and transmits its signal to other Redstone items that are next to it.

==== Redstone Power ====
In order for one of these items to be powered, it needs a power source such as a [[Lever]], [[Button]], or [[Pressure Plate]]. Experiment to find them all!

Place some Redstone Dust next to a power source and turn it on to power it.

There are many items that use a Redstone signal to do something, such as a Hopper or a [[Piston]].

Redstone allows for endless possibilities! Try creating something useful for yourself like an automatic farm!

== The End Dimension ==

=== The End ===
[[The End]] is another dimension which can be accessed through an active [[End Portal]]. The End Portal can be found in a [[Stronghold]], which is deep underground in the Overworld.

Every [[End Portal frame]] block is missing something mysterious to bring out the power within.

==== The Other Side ====
Once the portal is active, jump into it to go to The End.

The End is home to the dreaded [[Ender Dragon]]. She is a fierce and powerful enemy and seems to draw power from strange crystals. Her breath and fireball attacks leave lingering acid across the battlefield. Bring some friends to ensure your victory!

If once wasn't enough, add four [[End Crystal]]s to the [[exit portal]] corners to reawaken the Ender Dragon.

=== Eye Of Ender ===
[[Eyes of Ender]] are mysteriously connected to the End and will behave strangely when used.

Rumor has it that they can lead you to open another dimension.

=== End Cities ===
After killing the [[Ender Dragon]], an [[End Gateway]] will appear. Throwing an [[Ender Pearl]] into the portal will teleport you to the outer islands.

This alien new landscape must hide something interesting, and maybe something to bring back with you.

=== Elytra ===
[[Elytra]] are an item that can be equipped to allow gliding. Elytra are equipped in the chest armor slot.

Elytra cannot be crafted, but are found in [[Item Frame]]s in rare [[End Ship]]s, guarded by fearsome [[Shulker]]s.

==== Learn to Fly ====
When equipped with Elytra, a player can press SPACE while falling to start gliding. Note that you need to be quite high to really get the full effect.

While gliding, you can steer by looking around. If you look downwards, you'll move faster - but you'll also hit the ground sooner. If you look upwards, you'll gain some height - but do it for to long and you'll stall, falling instead of rising!

Your Elytra will slowly lose durability while flying, and if they break mid-flight you'll fall. You can repair them by combining them with [[Phantom Membrane]] at an [[Anvil]].

==== Rocket Powered Flight ====
[[Firework Rocket]]s that have no effects can be used to extend Elytra flight. You will be if you use a Firework Rocket that has effects to extend flight.

=== Shulker ===
Combine two [[Shulker Shell]]s with a Chest to create a [[Shulker Box]]. Shulker Shells are dropped by [[Shulker]]s found in [[End Cities]]. Unlike other containers, Shulker Boxes keep their items when broken. Shulker Boxes will break and drop as an item if pushed by [[Piston]]s, and can be placed using [[Dispenser]]s.

== Options & Cheats ==

=== Game Settings ===
When creating a world, you have many options. Below are the various settings that can be used to fine tune your experience. Don't worry if you didn't set them when you created the world, they can be changed at any time.

* World Name: This is where you can name your world.
* Default Game Mode: This is the [[gamemode]] that all new players to the world will start with. You can have players start in either [[survival]] or [[creative]] mode. Selecting creative mode will turn cheats on.
* Difficulty: This setting affects how [[Difficulty|difficult]] the world will be. You can choose Peaceful, Easy, Normal, or Hard.

==== World Preferences ====

* Starting Map: If this setting is turned on, every player will start with a [[map]] in their hotbar.
* Bonus Chest: If this setting is turned on, there will be a [[Bonus Chest|chest]] with some starting loot near your initial spawn location.
* World Type: This setting controls the way the world is created. Select Infinite or Flat from the drop down menu to change the world type.
** Infinite worlds go on and on forever.
** Flat worlds do not have any hills or trees, just an infinite flat area to fill with your creations.
* Seed: This is a unique number for the world. By entering a [[World seed|seed]] when you make a new world, you can control how it is created. You can also use a word or phrase for the seed and the game will convert it to a number for you.

==== Cheats and Gamerules ====

* Activate Cheats: This setting allows players to use [[commands]]. When a world is created with this setting on, all [[achievement]]s are disabled.

Below are [[gamerule]]s, cheats must be turned on to use them:

* Always Day: Night will never fall when this setting is turned on.
* Do Daylight Cycle: The time will not advance when this setting is turned off.
* Keep Inventory: This setting allows players to keep their inventory when they die.
* Mob Spawning: This prevents all mobs from spawning when this setting is off.
* Mob Griefing: Prevents mobs from destroying the world.
* Entities Drop Loot: Controls whether things like [[minecart]]s and [[armor stand]]s drop themselves when they are broken.
* Weather Cycle: The [[weather]] will not change when this setting is turned off.

=== Difficulty ===
''Minecraft'' has varying levels of difficulty so you can tailor the game to your level.

==== Peaceful ====
No hostile mobs will spawn except for Shulkers and the Ender Dragon, but they won't do any damage to you.

==== Easy ====
Hostile mobs spawn but deal less damage. Hunger bar depletes and drains health down to 5 hearts.

==== Normal ====
Hostile mobs will do normal damage to you, and if your hunger level drops to zero your health will begin to drop, but you won't die.

==== Hard ====
Hostile mobs will do more damage, zombies will break through doors, and if your hunger level drops to zero, your health will drop and you could die.

=== Adventure Mode ===
[[Adventure]] Mode is a gamemode for world builders. In Adventure Mode, players must use special tools to place or break blocks.

To get these specual tools, you must use {{command|give}} with {{code|canplace}} or {{code|candestroy}} parameters while in [[creative]] mode.

=== Creative Mode ===
Creative Mode is there so you can build the land of your dreams mob free!

==== Unlimited Building ====
The creative mode interface allows any item in the game to be moved into the player's inventory without the need for mining or crafting the item. The items in the player's inventory will not be removed when they are placed or used in the world, and this allows the player to focus on building rather than resource gathering.

If you create, load, or save a world in Creative Mode, that world will have [[achievement]]s and leaderboard updates disabled for that world, even if it then loaded in [[Survival Mode]].

==== Flying ====
To fly when in Creative Mode, press SPACE twice quickly. To exit flying, repeat the action. To fly faster, press W twice in rapid succession, or press CONTROL while flying. When in flying mode, you can hold down SPACE to move up and SHIFT to move down.

=== Commands ===
Commands can be executed from [[Chat]]. Type / before you type the command.

There are multitudes of commands that will allow you to do amazing things. There are many sources out there that provide you with all of the info that you'll ever need.

=== Host and Player Options ===
When playing with cheats on, host options will allow you to teleport yourself or friends, change the weather, set the time of day, and change the entry point or world spawn of your game. Once cheats are enabled, you can find these options in the chat window by pressing the [/] button next to the chat bar.

=== Command Blocks ===
[[Command Block]]s are a powerful tool for map creators. They store and execute commands upon receiving a [[Redstone]] signal.

To get a command block you must use {{command|give}}.

When a command block has either executed or failed to execute its stored command, it sends a Redstone signal from the side where the arrow is pointing.

You can set the name of the command block in the Hover Note field.

Block type - There are three types of command blocks, each with their own color and behavior:

* Impulse - Only executes the stored command when the block receives a redstone signal.
* Chain - Executes the stored command when the command block behind it has or has not executed its command.
* Repeat - Once activated, this Command Block will continue executing its stored command as long as it exists.

Condition - There are two conditions, each will affect the behavior of the Command Block:

* Unconditional - Executes the stored command even if the Command Block behind it failed to execute its command.
* Conditional - Executes the stored command only if the Command Block behind it succeeded in executing its command.

Redstone - There are two redstone settings, each will affect the behavior of the Command Block:

* Needs Redstone - Requires a redstone signal to activate.
* Always Active - Does not require a redstone signal to activate.

A Command Block also shows you its previous output. This will help you figure out if a Command Block failed to execute its command and why.

[[Allow and Deny]] blocks control where players can build in a world.

Players can place or destroy blocks above Allow blocks. Players cannot place or destroy blocks above Deny blocks.

Allow and Deny blocks do not affect the area below them.

An Allow block with a Deny block somewhere below it prevents players from building in the space between the two blocks. Above the Allow block, players can place and destroy blocks.
