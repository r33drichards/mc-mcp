'''Wheat''' is an [[item]] primarily obtained by harvesting fully-grown [[wheat crop]]s. It is used for [[crafting]] as well as to feed certain animals.

== Obtaining ==
=== Farming ===
{{main|Tutorial:Crop farming}}
When a fully-grown wheat crop is harvested, it drops 1 wheat and 1 to 4 [[wheat seeds]] ({{frac|2|5|7}} per crop harvested on average). A wheat crop has a total of eight stages (0-7) from the time it is planted until it can be harvested. If a crop is harvested before it is fully grown, it just drops one seed. Wheat needs a [[Light|light level]] of at least 9 to grow {{in|je}}, while {{in|be}} it needs an [[Light#Internal light level|internal light level]] of 9; a seed is destroyed if planted without light{{Only|Java}}. Harvesting with a [[Fortune]]-enchanted tool increases the number of seeds dropped but does not increase the yield of wheat.

=== Crafting ===

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|wheat}}

=== Mob loot ===
A [[fox]] sometimes spawns holding wheat, which it drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a [[food]] item, causing the fox to drop the wheat.

== Usage ==
=== Animal food ===
[[File:New Cattle.png|thumb|Using wheat to lead a cow.]]
When wheat is held, it causes nearby [[cow]]s, [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[mooshroom]]s to follow the player, until either the player stops holding the wheat or goes too far away from the animal, thus leading them to lose interest.

Wheat may be used to [[breed]] cows, sheep, goats, and mooshrooms by first herding two of them together and then {{control|using}} the wheat on them to begin "Love Mode."

Wheat can heal a [[horse]] {{hp|1}} health or lower its temper by 3% when attempting to tame it. It can also decrease the time it takes for a foal to grow by 20 seconds.

Similarly, wheat can heal a [[llama]] {{hp|2}} health, and it decreases the time it takes a baby llama to grow by 10 seconds.

=== Trading ===

=== Composting ===
Placing wheat into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of wheat yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

{{Video note|the narrator demonstrates at 0:56 that walking over wheat can destroy the crop and un-till the land. This is outdated: since version {{Version link|JE 1.1}}, wheat can be destroyed only by a player or mob jumping on it or falling on it.}}
