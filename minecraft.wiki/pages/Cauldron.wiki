A '''cauldron''' is a [[block]] that can contain [[water]], [[lava]] or [[powder snow]] and, in certain situations, collect them from the environment. {{IN|bedrock}}, it can also hold dyed water or [[potion]]s, and can be used to efficiently create [[tipped arrow]]s. It also serves as a [[leatherworker]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A cauldron can be obtained using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Regardless of the tool, when a cauldron is destroyed, its contents are lost.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Cauldron|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Witch Hut.jpg|thumb|A naturally occurring cauldron inside of a [[witch hut]].]]
A single empty cauldron is generated in each [[swamp hut]]. {{IN|be}}, the cauldrons generated there are {{frac|1|3}} to {{frac|3|3}} full of a random [[potion]].

A cauldron {{frac|2|3}} full of water is generated in each [[igloo]] basement.

[[File:MansionJailInner.png|thumb|A cauldron in a [[woodland mansion]] jail.]]
Cauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of [[woodland mansion]]s.

Two filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and plains [[village]] tannery houses.

A single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses.

{{IN|java}}, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses.

Cauldrons can also generate in [[trail ruins]].

=== Crafting ===
A cauldron can be crafted from [[iron ingot]]s.

|A2= Iron Ingot
|C2= Iron Ingot
|A3= Iron Ingot
|B3= Iron Ingot
|C3= Iron Ingot
|Output= Cauldron

}}

== Usage ==
=== Storage for substances ===
Cauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include [[milk]], [[Honey Bottle|honey]] and any food items that exist in [[bowl]]s; namely [[mushroom stew]], [[beetroot soup]], [[rabbit stew]] and [[suspicious stew]]. {{IN|java}}, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them.

==== Water ====
{{Anchor|Holding water}}
A cauldron can be filled with [[water]] by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by {{control|using}} an empty [[bucket]] on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a [[fish bucket]] on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.<ref>{{bug|MC-129109||Using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill the cauldron with water|WAI}}</ref>

A cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.{{only|be}}

{{IN|je}}, a cauldron can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by {{control|using}} a [[water bottle]] on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by {{control|using}} a [[glass bottle]] on it.

{{IN|be}}, a cauldron can contain six levels of water, and {{control|using}} a water bottle or a bottle on a cauldron respectively adds or removes two levels from it. If there are less than two levels remaining, a bottle cannot be used to retrieve the remaining water, and it must be either replaced or removed through a method that reduces the level by one. 

A cauldron slowly fills with [[water]] when [[rain]]ed upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during [[snowfall]].

Water can be stored in a cauldron, even in [[the Nether]]. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes.

Water in a cauldron does ''not'' absorb [[explosion]] damage; make [[sound]]s and [[particle]]s; absorb fall damage;<ref>{{bug|MC-176867||Fall damage for water cauldron|WF}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-104572||Player takes fall damage when falling into a cauldron full of water|WF}}</ref> allow [[trident]]s enchanted with [[Riptide]] to activate;<ref>{{bug|MC-145311||Riptide trident doesn't work while standing in a filled cauldron|WF}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-93111||Riptide does not work when inside a cauldron filled with water|WF}}</ref> or damage [[endermen]]{{only|java|short=1}}, [[strider]]s, or [[blaze]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-106813||Endermen, striders, blazes, snowmen, and bees don't take damage when inside of water cauldrons|WF}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-171760||Certain mobs don't take damage in water cauldron|WF}}</ref> Cauldrons do ''not'' deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them<ref>{{bug|MC-152680||You cannot drown in water cauldrons}}</ref> and [[fish]] act as if there is no water inside it.<ref>{{bug|MC-126819||fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fill with water|WF}}</ref> The player ''cannot'' float or [[swim]] in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does ''not'' produce any bubble or water particles.

A cauldron placed below a down-facing [[pointed dripstone]] that has a waterlogged block{{only|JE}} or water source placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The cauldron can be placed at most 10 blocks below the dripstone, and will not be filled if any [[solid block]], water or lava{{Only|JE|short=1}}/ any block{{Only|BE|short=1}} is within this range.

Attempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.{{only|be}} 

The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a [[sponge]], whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not.<ref>{{bug|MC-271196||Sponges do not absorb water stored in Cauldrons|WAI}}</ref>

==== Lava ====
{{Anchor|Holding lava}}
[[File:Lava Cauldron.png|150px|thumb|Cauldron filled with lava]]

Cauldrons can be used to hold lava. Lava can be manually added to a cauldron using a [[lava bucket]], and can be removed with an empty [[bucket]]. {{IN|be|ee}}, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. 

A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any [[entity]] inside of it; {{in|be|ee|short=1}}, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like [[zombified piglin]]s. 

Lava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron. 

A [[redstone comparator]] with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.<ref name=JavaLava>{{bug|MC-204393||Lava Cauldron emits redstone signal strength 1 instead of 3|Fixed}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-104824||Lava Cauldron emits 3 redstone signal strength instead of 1|WAI}}</ref>

A cauldron placed below a downward-facing [[pointed dripstone]] that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava, making lava [[renewable]]. The same condition for filling water from pointed dripstones applies.

Lava inside cauldrons does not have different height "levels" like water inside cauldrons does, and [[glass bottle]]s cannot be used on a lava cauldron.

Lava inside cauldrons does not spread fires like free lava.

==== Holding powder snow ====
[[Powder snow]] is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during [[snowfall]], if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three{{only|java|short=1}} or six{{only|bedrock|short=1}} layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, {{ctrl|interacting}} using a [[bucket]] creates a [[powder snow bucket]] and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing [[leather boots]] still fall through the powder snow.

A [[redstone comparator]] with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3.

Contrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as {{control|using}} the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it.

==== Dyed water ====
{{Anchor|Applying dye to cauldron water}}
[[File:Dyed water with two dyes.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|All colors of dyed water that can be made with two dyes.]]
{{exclusive|bedrock|education|section=yes}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[water]] in a cauldron can be dyed. {{control|Using}} a [[dye]] on the cauldron colors the water (at any fill level), consuming the dye. Multiple dyes may be added (one at a time) to produce mixed colors. {{control|Using}} any piece of [[leather armor]], [[leather horse armor]], or [[wolf armor]] on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed.

Attempting to add water, lava, powder snow, or potions to dyed water empties the cauldron.

==== Potions ====
{{Anchor|Holding potions}}
{{exclusive|bedrock|education|section=yes}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, a cauldron can hold normal [[potion]]s, [[splash potion]]s and [[lingering potion]]s. {{control|Using}} a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by two levels. A [[glass bottle]] can then be {{control|used}} on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by two levels.

{{control|Using}} an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a [[tipped arrow]] with that potion [[effect]], and reduces the potion in the cauldron by two levels. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than two levels at once. 2 levels of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 4 levels up to 32, and 6 levels up to a full stack of arrows, resulting in 16 tipped arrows per potion.

''Technically'', the bottom three levels of a cauldron are only counted as a single level for the purposes of tipping arrows. However, getting a cauldron with three levels is impossible without cheats, since putting potions in or using them always changes the level by two. Any quantity of arrows that would leave less one level of potion remaining when tipped empties the cauldron completely. If there is only one level of potion in the cauldron (which can only be achieved by directly setting the block of editing the NBT data to be that way), it cannot be retrieved using a glass bottle and must be either replaced or used to tip an [[arrow]].

Attempting to put [[water]], [[lava]] or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes a hissing sound, and empties the cauldron.

An entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion.

Using an empty [[bucket]] on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.

=== Removing dye from items ===
{{Main|Dye#Dyeing armor}}
A cauldron with [[water]] can wash the dye off of [[leather armor]], [[leather horse armor]], [[wolf armor]], and [[shulker box]]es, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a [[banner]]. This is done by pressing {{control|use}} on the cauldron with the leather armor, wolf armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a cauldron has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to leatherworker and claim the cauldron as their [[job site block]].

=== Extinguishing fire ===
A cauldron with [[water]] or [[powder snow]] extinguishes [[entities]] on [[fire]] that fall into it and the entity emits black particles. This includes [[mob]]s, [[player]]s, [[item]]s (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming [[arrow]]s{{only|je|short=1}}. Flaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished. Entities must reach the water or powder snow in it. Each entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level. If the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.

=== Redstone component ===
[[File:Cauldron transmission over piston.png|An example of a cauldron used in a [[redstone]] circuit.|thumb]]
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A cauldron can act as a power source for a [[redstone comparator]]. With a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava. However, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.

== Sounds ==
=== Generic ===
Despite being composed entirely of iron, cauldrons do not use iron sounds.<ref>{{bug|MC-279220||Cauldrons do not use minecraft:block.iron.* sounds despite being made of iron|Invalid}}</ref>
