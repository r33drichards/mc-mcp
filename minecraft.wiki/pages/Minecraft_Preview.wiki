'''''Minecraft Preview''''' is an application that can be used by players to test out beta features from {{BE}}. It functions as a separate application, instead of the previous system of opt-in beta content inside of the ''Bedrock Edition'' game itself.<ref name="mcpreview">{{cite|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4423653831821|title=Minecraft Preview FAQ - Home|website=help.minecraft.net|date=January 31, 2022}}</ref> 

As of 2025, ''Minecraft Preview'' is available for Windows,<ref name="w10preview">{{tweet|JORAX79|1491518112016961538|Happy Wednesday!

== Development ==
On January 31, 2022, it was announced that the beta program would be expanded to other platforms, starting with iOS and iPadOS, in the form of ''Minecraft Preview'' app, separate from the normal ''Bedrock Edition'' app. The initial iOS and iPadOS launch was only limited to 500 users on TestFlight,<ref>{{tweet|JORAX79|1488619719724703746|Day 1 Minecraft Preview on iOS stats (all anonymous):<br /><nowiki>- Slots: 500</nowiki><br /><nowiki>- Installs: 487</nowiki><br /><nowiki>- Most sessions for 1 player: 46</nowiki><br /><nowiki>- Most crashes for 1 player: 20 (looking into this!)</nowiki><br /><nowiki>- JIRA (bugs.mojang.com) bugs created or up-voted for Preview: 6</nowiki>|February 1, 2022}}</ref> which was later expanded by adding 500 more later on.<ref>{{tweet|JORAX79|1489381137747042307|Hi all - we will be adding 500 additional slots for the iOS version of Minecraft Preview at 6:30pm PST (2:30am UTC)! That will be about 3 hours from now.<br /><br />As a reminder the opt-in link is http://aka.ms/PreviewApple. But it isn't ready yet - remember to check in 3 hours 😄|February 3, 2022}}</ref>

Later on February 7, 2022, ''Minecraft Preview'' was released for Xbox players via Xbox Insider Hub first, to test the migration of player worlds to the new app. The testing period was divided into two phases, for which users who don't own ''Minecraft'' can participate in,<ref name="xboxpreview" /> before it is officially released only to those who have bought ''Minecraft'' on Xbox.<ref>{{tweet|JORAX79|1490751506420670467|This is true and warrants an update to the FAQ. The current Xbox Insider version of Preview is available to everyone in that program.

After the ''Minecraft Preview'' releases on iOS, iPadOS, and Xbox, the app released on Windows on February 9, 2022 and on PlayStation on February 15, 2024. Only players who own and bought the game can download and play ''Minecraft Preview''.<ref name="w10preview" />

== Differences from ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
''Minecraft Preview'' has some different features and functionalities from ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' that are not planned to be implemented in the base game in the next update:

* The top of the screen always shows some debug information, similar to the information on the first few rows of the [[debug screen]] in ''[[Java Edition]]''. The first row shows the version, build, specifications about [[RenderDragon]], and some device specifications. The second row shows information related to performance, such as FPS, memory usage, but also the screen resolution and GUI scaling, and the third row shows some more performance specifications. When playing on [[Realms]], the Realm ID is also shown here. It can be disabled in [[options.txt]].
* A render of the currently selected skin is shown in each player's profile screen.
* ''Minecraft Preview'' is not compatible with regular ''Bedrock Edition'' [[Bedrock Dedicated Server|servers]], but uses a separate server version. This also applies to Realms.
** Players owning a Realms subscription on ''Bedrock Edtion'' have access to a separate Realms server on ''Minecraft Preview''.
* [[Achievements|Achievements or trophies]] are not available on ''Minecraft Preview''.
* Several [[menu screen]]s get updated with a toggleable [[Ore UI]] design preview. As of [[Bedrock Edition Preview 26.0.26|26.0.26]], these include the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]], [[Settings#Keyboard & Mouse|Keyboard & Mouse settings]], [[Settings#General 2|general settings]], [[Settings#Video|video settings]], [[Settings#Audio|audio settings]], [[Settings#Account|account settings]], [[Settings#Language 2|language settings]], and the Realms [[edit world]] screen. Ore UI versions of these menu screens get implemented in ''Bedrock Edition'' in a later update, but not always the update where the ''Preview'' version is made for.
* The "Render Dragon Features for Creators" [[Experiments|experiment]] is only available in ''Minecraft Preview''.
** This includes [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point light]] features for Vibrant Visuals.
* Realms and [[Marketplace Pass]] subscriptions can't be managed from ''Minecraft Preview''.
* Exclusive [[loading tips]] are shown in the loading world screen.
* The only [[splash]] that can be seen in game is "Preview!!!".
* An exclusive [[panorama]] is shown when Vibrant Visuals is disabled.

All other features from ''Bedrock Edition'' are still available, plus features that will be included in the update where the ''Preview'' version is made for.
