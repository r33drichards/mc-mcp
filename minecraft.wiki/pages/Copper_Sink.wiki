The '''copper sink''' is a joke [[block]] introduced in [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]]. It can appear only if the <code>minecraft:copper_sink</code> vote is active. It can be used to hold water and to delete copper-based blocks and items.

== Obtaining ==

=== Breaking ===
A copper sink is the only block type in the game that does not have an associated tool to break it. It also cannot be dropped with [[Silk Touch]].

== Usage ==
A copper sink can be filled with water by using a [[water bucket]] on the sink. Interacting with a filled sink using a [[bucket]] empties the sink and fills the bucket. Bottles cannot be used on the copper sink, nor can buckets with other liquids.

Dropping any exclusively copper-based item into the sink deletes the item, including [[Raw Copper]], [[Copper Ingot]], [[Block of Copper]], and other copper sinks.

== Trivia ==
* The copper sink block is a joke referring to the Minecraft community's request that [[Mojang Studios]] add a [[copper]] "sink" (in video game development language, a "sink" refers to a gameplay feature that requires constant resource investment, preventing players from hoarding resources), as [[copper ingot]]s had few uses at the time compared to other similar items like [[iron ingot]]s.
