'''Wolf armor''' is an [[item]] crafted from [[armadillo scute]]s that can be equipped on a [[wolf]] to completely protect it against most damage types. It has limited durability, but can be repaired by {{Control|using}} armadillo scutes on the wolf wearing it. It can also be [[dye]]d.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Wolves]] wearing wolf armor always drop their wolf armor when they die, regardless of what kills them.

== Usage ==
[[File:Wolves with Dyed Wolf Armor.jpg|thumb|Wolves wearing wolf armor.]]
[[File:Wolf wearing Wolf Armor.png|thumb|200px|A pale wolf wearing wolf armor.]]
Only adult tamed [[wolves]] can wear armor.

=== Protection ===
{{Control|Using}} wolf armor on a wolf that the player has [[tamed]] equips it onto the wolf.

Wolf armor absorbs all damage done to the wolf with some exceptions (see the list below), until its durability runs out. When the armor absorbs damage, the wolf does not emit a hurt noise, but still turns red for 10 ticks. The +{{armor|11}} statistic in the tooltip of wolf armor is a result of a bug<ref>{{bug|MC-268913||Wolf armor tooltip displays "+11 Armor", despite protecting 100% of damage}}</ref> and should be ignored.

Wolf armor does not absorb damage dealt by the following damage sources:
* [[Drowning]]
* [[Freezing]]
* [[Suffocating]]
* [[Magic damage|Magic]]
* [[Thorns]]
* The [[Wither (effect)|Wither effect]]
* The [[void]]
* Being outside the [[world border]]{{only|je}}
* [[Entity cramming]]{{only|je}}
* {{cmd|kill}}

Wolf armor ''does'' absorb damage dealt by these sources that are not reduced by [[Armor|player]] or [[horse armor]];
* [[Fall damage]]
* Ongoing damage from being on [[fire]]
* Ender dragon's [[Ender Dragon#Attacking|breath attack]]

If the owner uses [[shears]] on a wolf that is wearing armor, the armor gets unequipped from the wolf.

If a wolf dies while equipped with wolf armor, the armor is dropped.

=== Durability ===
<section begin="durability" /> <!-- for transclusion at [[Durability]]; do not remove or tamper -->
[[File:Wolf armor breaking.mp4|thumb|right|autoplay|muted|loop|A zombie damaging and breaking armor worn by a wolf]]
Wolf armor loses one point of durability for each point of damage absorbed. If the damage of an attack exceeds the remaining durability, all damage is absorbed anyway.

When the durability of wolf armor falls below some thresholds (when reaching 60, 44, and 20 durability points left), the armor produces a cracking sound effect and damage particles, and it becomes more visually damaged. Particles and a sound effect are also produced when wolf armor fully breaks.
<section end="durability" />

=== Repairing ===
{{control|Using}} an [[armadillo scute]] on a wolf wearing wolf armor heals 8 points of the armor's durability.

==== Anvil repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
| head=1
| Damaged Wolf Armor
| Damaged Wolf Armor; Armadillo Scute
| Wolf Armor
| tail=1
}}

A wolf armor can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[armadillo scute]]s, with each scute restoring 16 points of the armor's durability (25% of its maximum durability). Two wolf armor can also be combined in an anvil, which adds 7 points of durability (5% of maximum durability).

=== Enchanting ===
Wolf armor cannot be enchanted in survival mode. However, {{in|java}} creative mode, just like any other item, it can be enchanted with any enchantment using an anvil.

Effects of the enchantments on wolf armor:
* [[Thorns]] and [[Curse of Vanishing]] apply their effects to the wolf just as to the player.
* [[Fire Protection]] and [[Blast Protection]] offer no additional damage reduction, as even unenchanted wolf armor reduces those damage types by 100%. However, their secondary effects (burning time reduction and knockback reduction, respectively) work as expected.
* [[Protection]] causes the wolf armor to protect the wolf even against the damage sources that usually bypass it.
** Wolf armor enchanted with Protection only protects part of the damage from those damage types, just as it does for the player.
** [[Durability]] of wolf armor is not reduced by these damage types.
** Void damage and the /kill command completely bypass the Protection enchantment on wolf armor.
* [[Unbreaking]] increases the average effective durability by 100%, 200% and 300% on levels I, II and III, respectively.
** This is different from the effect that Unbreaking has on player armor. Instead, Unbreaking on wolf armor works as if wolf armor was rather a tool.
* [[Curse of Binding]] prevents the player in Survival mode from shearing the armor. However, players in Creative can still shear it.
* [[Mending]] works as expected, but wolf armor must be held in the hand of a player. Armor with Mending doesn't automatically repair itself on a wolf, as wolves can't absorb experience.
* Other enchantments have no effect on the wolf armor.

=== Dyeing ===
{{main|Dye#Dyeing armor}}

Wolf armor can be dyed by combining it with [[dye]](s) through crafting {{in|java}}, or by {{control|using}} it on a [[cauldron]] containing dyed water {{in|bedrock}}. {{control|Using}} dyed wolf armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.
