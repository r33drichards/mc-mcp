A '''thunderstorm''' is a somewhat uncommon and dangerous [[weather]] condition.

== Behavior ==

Thunderstorms are an uncommon temporary, global occurrence<ref>{{tweet|notch|55984678875836416|It's temporal and global|April 07, 2011}}</ref> that can happen randomly at any time, within the [[Overworld]]. Whether it [[Rain|rains]], [[Snowfall|snows]], or no precipitation is active during a thunderstorm varies depending on the [[temperature]] of the biome, as well as the current [[altitude]].

* While the clear counter is counting down, the weather is always clear. This counter is used only when the {{cmd|weather clear}} command is issued, setting the counter to a value given by the player or 5 minutes.
* The rain counter counts down to zero, and each time it reaches zero, the rain is toggled on or off. When the rain is turned on, the counter is reset to a value between 12,000-24,000 ticks (0.5-1 game days), and when the rain is turned off the counter is reset to a value of 12,000-180,000 ticks (0.5-7.5 game days).
* Like the rain counter, the thunder counter also toggles thunder on and off when it reaches zero, but clear weather overrides the "on" state. When thunder is turned on, the thunder counter is reset to 3,600-15,600 ticks (3-13 minutes), and when thunder is turned off the counter resets to 12,000-180,000 ticks (0.5-7.5 game days).
* Thunder can occur in the game only when the rain and thunder states both happen to be "on" at the same time. The random combinations of the states toggled by the rain and thunder counters result in a 1.44% chance for a thunderstorm to occur, or an approximate average real-time duration of 9 hours between thunderstorms.
*  The values in each range are uniformly distributed.

Thunderstorms can be skipped entirely with the use of a [[bed]], regardless of the time of day.

== Effects ==
[[File:Thunder Vibrant Visuals.png|thumb|A thunderstorm with [[Vibrant Visuals]].]]
As with rain and snow, the sky is darkened and the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[star]]s are no longer visible. {{IN|be}}, the sky color is changed to {{Color|rgb(51, 51, 51)}}, which is blended with a weight of 75% with [[biome]] and rain sky colors. The sun and moon are still visible in dry biomes in ''Bedrock Edition''. Thunderstorms darken the world, causing the [[light]] level from the sky to visually decrease to 10. The clouds darken from white to dark gray (95% {{Color|rgb(30, 30, 30)}} in ''Bedrock Edition''), although clouds themselves do not precipitate or create lightning. [[Fog]] is colored {{Color|#666666}} ({{Color|#403C44}} in [[pale gardens]]), and is much denser, decreasing view distance by 30%. While the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.

Unlike during regular rainstorms or snowstorms, the [[sky light]] level is reduced by 10 for the purposes of hostile mob spawning, which allows hostile [[mobs]] to spawn at any time of day as long as the block light level is 0, even in dry biomes which have visibly full daylight in ''Bedrock Edition''.

=== Lightning ===
{{Distinguish|Lighting}}
{{anchor|Lightning Bolt}}

'''Lightning''' is a lethal element of thunderstorms. Lightning momentarily increases the sky light's brightness to slightly greater than full daylight, which is {{Color|rgb(204, 204, 255)}} in ''Bedrock Edition'', blended with other colors with a weight of 45%.

[[File:Lightning fire.png|thumb|left|200px|The fire that a lightning bolt creates.]]

Lightning strikes randomly and creates [[fire]]s (only on normal and hard difficulty) in a 2 block radius where it strikes. Such fires act normally, igniting all flammable materials, detonating [[TNT]], and even activating [[nether portal]]s. The lightning itself, however, is not destructive and does not destroy blocks. While most fires are extinguished by the rain, areas that block rain can allow the fire to spread, and any [[netherrack]], [[magma block]]s, [[soul sand]], or [[soul soil]] lit by lightning is not extinguished by the rain.

Most [[entities]] struck by lightning are dealt {{hp|5}} damage (sometimes twice in succession) and are set on fire, which may cause additional damage. [[Boats]] (including [[boats with chests]]) may be destroyed entirely leaving nothing behind.

If the player is killed by a lightning strike, the [[death message]] appears: "<player> was struck by lightning". This message does not display if the player was killed by the fire created by a lightning bolt.

Lightning {{in|bedrock}} changes color from white to orange at sunset, and appears brighter during the daytime.

Lightning may be manually summoned with the {{cmd|summon lightning_bolt}} command. It is summoned as an entity, and it can be referred to by [[commands]] or [[selectors]]. 

[[File:SkeletonRiderGroup.png|thumb|250px|A group of skeletal horsemen spawned during a thunderstorm.]]
[[File:Charged Creeper.gif|thumb|255x255px|[[Creeper#Charged creeper|Charged creeper]]]]
[[File:Villager becoming Witch.gif|thumb|A villager gets struck by lightning.]]

Lightning is also spawned when a [[trident]] enchanted with [[Channeling]] is thrown and strikes a mob or a [[lightning rod]] during a thunderstorm.

On [[graphics settings]] lower than ''Fabulous!'', [[water]] is invisible when seen through lightning.

==== Effects on mobs ====
A lightning strike affects certain mobs differently:
* Lightning may randomly spawn a [[Skeleton Horse#Spawning|"skeleton trap" horse]] with a chance of 0.75–1.5% chance on Easy, 1.5–4% on Normal, and 2.8125–6.75% on Hard, depending on the [[regional difficulty]]. A player triggers the trap by moving within 10 blocks of the horse, whereupon the horse transforms into four skeletal horsemen. A non-triggered trap horse despawns after 15 minutes.
* A [[pig]] struck by lightning turns into a [[zombified piglin]]. 
* A [[creeper]] becomes [[Creeper#Charged creeper|charged]]. 
* A [[villager]] gets replaced by a [[witch]] when [[lightning]] strikes within four blocks from it. 
* A red [[mooshroom]] changes into a [[brown mooshroom]] and vice versa.
* A lightning strike on a [[turtle]] instantly kills it, and it drops 1 [[bowl]] instead of its normal drops.<ref>{{bug|MC-125562|||Works as Intended}}</ref>

On peaceful difficulty, pigs and villagers take damage normally.

==== Lightning mechanics ====

For each loaded chunk, every tick there is a {{frac|1|100,000}} chance of an attempted lightning strike during a thunderstorm. From this probability, if ≈201 chunks are loaded (from a radius of 128 blocks from the player to the center of each chunk) then 90% of the time up to 5 lightning strikes occur in the world each minute, with an average of approximately 2.4 lightning strikes each minute.

When lightning is to strike, random X and Z coordinates within the chunk are chosen, and the block just above the highest block that is liquid or obstructs movement is chosen for the lightning strike. If a [[lightning rod]] is nearby, it strikes the rod instead. Then if there are any living entities that can see the sky in a 3×''h''×3 region from 3 below the target block up to the world height, one such entity is selected at random and the lightning target is moved to the block the entity stands in.

The target block is checked again for the following conditions:
* Target block can see the sky.
* Rain (not snow) is falling in the target block.
** Thus, lightning does not naturally strike within cold biomes or biomes where it does not rain.

If these conditions pass, lightning strikes.

When lightning strikes, all entities within a 6×12×6 region horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the target block with the bottom edge 3 below the target block are struck by lightning. Multiple passes are made over this region, so items dropped during an earlier pass may be destroyed during a subsequent pass; [[damage immunity]] usually prevents struck mobs from taking more than {{hp|5}} damage. [[Non-solid]] blocks (such as [[redstone]], [[torch]]es, and [[snow layer]]s) are not directly affected by lightning. Since lightning is an entity with the ID "lightning_bolt", it can be summoned with /summon, although it cannot be ridden with /ride.

==== Thunder ====
{{Redirect|Thunder|the ''Minecraft Dungeons'' enchantment|MCD:Thundering}}
'''Thunder''' is a sound event that occurs every time lightning strikes. Every player within 160 thousand blocks and in the same dimension hears the thunder. <!-- Source: [[Special:Diff/1578428]] -->

The ability to hear thunder affects multiplayer, as it is possible to hear lightning strike at someone else's base or use a modded Minecraft client to determine the direction of every strike in the world the player is in. Using the direction of strikes, it is possible to [[wikipedia:Triangulation (surveying)|triangulate]] the coordinates of lightning strikes. [[Worried panda]]s are also scared during thunderstorms.

Because lightning bolts only happen in loaded chunks, this can be used to, for example, know where the other player is in a multiplayer world with only two players.

==== Lightning rods ====
[[File:Pigconversion-MadewithClipchamp-ezgif.com-crop.webp|thumb|Range of lightning conversion when hitting a lightning rod.]]
Lightning strikes within a radius of 128 blocks (''Java Edition'') or 64 blocks (''Bedrock Edition'') of a [[lightning rod]] are redirected to the rod, emitting a [[redstone signal]]. This can be used to prevent flammable structures from being struck by lightning, or intentionally direct lightning toward or away from mobs. During a thunderstorm, they emit spark-like particles, even in biomes where lightning doesn't strike.

== Trivia ==
* Lightning, unlike other weather effects, does not have an image file associated with it. It is an entity, coded directly into the game engine, allowing for dynamic, realistic lightning.
* {{IN|be}}, lightning strikes closer to the player more often than in Java Edition, due to spawn distance limits.
* Because lightning is an entity, [[commands]] and [[command block]]s can be used to kill and remove them from the world.
