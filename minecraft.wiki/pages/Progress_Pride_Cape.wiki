The '''Progress Pride Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out to players who redeemed it for free while it was available.

== Appearance ==
The cape is a pixelated adaptation of {{w|Daniel Quasar}}'s {{w|Progress Pride Flag}} design. It features 6 vertical stripes, colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple from left to right, resembling a rainbow pattern from the traditional {{w|Rainbow flag (LGBTQ)|rainbow flag}}. Hovering above are a series of downward-pointed chevrons, colored white, pink, light blue, brown, and black from top to bottom. This pattern is repeated with the [[elytra]], instead being mirrored on both wings.

== Distribution ==
The cape was obtainable for free through the [[Marketplace]] during the [[Pride 2023 Sale]] event as part of a collection of [[Character Creator]] pieces. Players were not given the cape automatically.

The cape is only available in certain regions of the world.<ref>[[:File:Progress Pride Cape restriction warning.jpeg]]</ref>

=== Availability ===
{{missing info|section|countries where the cape is not shown.<br>Steps:
# Own the cape
# Use a VPN to change different other than your own country.
# Check if the cape shows in the Character Creator and in a world.
# Write a list of unrestricted and restricted countries.
}}
The cape is region-locked, meaning it could not be claimed in certain countries. The exact list of restricted countries is unknown due to not being public.
