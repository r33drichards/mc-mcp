'''Tutorial hints''' (also known as '''game tips''' in {{BE}}) are [[toasts]] on the player's [[HUD]] which show up when a player starts a world in [[Survival mode]] for the first time on a device. They are meant to guide new players on the game [[controls]].

== Description ==
When a [[Survival]] world is generated for the first time on a device, the first tutorial hint appears: the movement hint. Tutorial hints appear as a toasts in the top right of the screen (much like new [[Recipe Book|recipes]]), or pointing to related HUD elements.{{Only|be|short=1}} Each hint consists of the hint title,{{Only|je|short=1}} a description of how to complete it, and an image to describe it, usually an animation of [[Alex]] performing the action with the required controls in ''Bedrock Edition''. Once the tutorial hint has been completed (for example, when the player harvests a tree's log), that tutorial hint disappears. After a certain amount of time or when certain events happen, the next hint is shown automatically. {{IN|je}}, once the "craft wooden planks" hint is completed, tutorial hints never again appear in any world. {{IN|be}}, any tutorial hint is always shown 3 times before they never appear again, but the tutorial can be reset in the "General" [[settings]] tab, where it can also be disabled entirely.

Tutorial hints are obtained by simply completing the task given. {{IN|je}} each hint, minus the "Open your inventory" and the "Craft wooden planks" hint, have a progress bar that shows the player's progress on the current hint and fills up as it is being completed. For example, for the "Destroy the tree" hint, the progress bar begins emptying and starts filling up as the player harvests a log, so that when the log is destroyed, the bar is complete and the hint disappears.

In [[Creative]] mode, only the first two hints are displayed,{{Only|je|short=1}} or a different set of tutorial hints is used.{{Only|be|short=1}} Different tutorial hints also appear in ''Bedrock Edition'' when using different control modes.

{{IN|je}}, when an open to LAN world or multiplayer server is first joined on a device, there is also a hint about the social interaction menu. It simply tells the player that they can press the {{key|P}} button on the keyboard to open the social interactions menu.

=== options.txt ===
{{IN|je}}, the gameplay stages of the tutorial is stored as <code>tutorialStep:</code> in the <code>[[options.txt]]</code> file in the game directory, except the [[Social Interactions]] hint, which is stored as <code>joinedFirstServer:</code>, so they are kept per device and per directory (you can set up more profiles with different game directories in the launcher options). After the last guide is shown, the value <code>none</code> is saved. Changing TutorialStep to this value (the game must be closed beforehand) prevents the instructions from appearing.

{{IN|be}}, each game tip has its own line in <code>options.txt</code> to track whether or not it's been completed.
