==Water==
The physics for water have also been changed, and the way the player interacts with water has also changed.

===Swimming===
There is now an actual swimming animation used by the player while underwater, which can be activated by sprinting underwater. This also allows the player to move in any direction they are looking including down. Players who cannot sprint, i.e. are too hungry to sprint, cannot swim. Crouching underwater also allows the player to descend at a faster rate.

While swimming, players can go through one block gaps similar to when using an [[elytra]].

===Item and Experience===
Items and experience orbs now float to the surface of water rather than sink, this makes dying underwater easier to deal with because all of the player's items now wait at the surface. This also allows for easy vertical item transportation.

===Bubble Columns===
<em>''For more detailed information see [[Bubble Column]]s.''</em>

[[Magma]] and [[soul sand]] now make bubble columns when placed underwater. Magma naturally generates in [[underwater ruins]] and where underwater ravines meet lava, while soul sand does not currently generate naturally in oceans. Players are able to breathe while in bubble columns.

Magma bubble columns pull things down to the bottom; this includes items, players, mobs, and boats. Soul sand bubble columns rapidly push all entities, including players, to the surface.

===Breath===
The breath meter no longer instantly refills when entering air from underwater; this means it is no longer possible to instantly refill the air meter with a torch while underwater.

===Vision===
Water has been given unique colors depending on the biome they are in. 

Water is also now clearer, and the longer the player is underwater the clearer it becomes.
