'''Leather pants'''{{fn|Also known as '''leather trousers''' in [[Language#Differences between English variants|British English]].}} are a variant of [[leggings]] that are crafted from [[leather]]. They are the seventh-highest [[tier]] of leggings, having the lowest armor points and durability. Like all [[leather armor]], they can be [[dye|dyed]] and protect the wearer from [[freezing]].

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include leather pants. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the pants they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped pants are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5–19.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
When worn, leather pants provide {{armor|2}} [[armor points]].
==== Powder snow ====
As with all pieces of leather armor, wearing leather pants protects the player from freezing in [[powder snow]].

==== Repairing ====
Two damaged leather pants can be combined through [[crafting]] or using the [[grindstone]]. The durability of the used leather pants are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either pants.

Leather pants can also be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[leather]], with each item restoring 25% of the pants' maximum durability, rounded down. Two pants can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods using the anvil preserves the pants' [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
Leggings can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade pants with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], the pants, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

=== Dyeing ===
{{main|Dye#Dyeing armor}}

Leather pants can be dyed by combining it with [[dye]](s) through crafting {{in|java}}, or by {{control|using}} it on a [[cauldron]] containing dyed water {{in|bedrock}}. {{control|Using}} dyed leather pants on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.
