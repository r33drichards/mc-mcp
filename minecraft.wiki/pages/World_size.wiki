'''World size''' is an option to change the size of the finite worlds in ''[[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]]'' and [[Legacy Console Edition]] (specific to ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'',  and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]''). By default, worlds generate at the largest size available in each edition.
<!-- The Bedrock codebase technically has 2 world size options, "Old", which limits the world to be 256x128x256, and "Infinite", which generates normal terrain until approximately 12.55 million blocks, -->

== Legacy Console Edition ==

In the finite worlds of Legacy Console Edition, the edge of the [[Overworld]] is surrounded by an endless sea of [[water]] preceded by an invisible barrier. The outer two chunks of the usable world is usually a smooth transition from the main landmass/noise generation to the sea of water. The edge of [[the Nether]] is surrounded by a wall of [[bedrock]]. [[The End]] is not affected by world size. Worlds are able to generate with any of the [[biome]]s and [[Structure|generated structures]] available in the [[Legacy Console Edition version history|current version]]. The tile on each edge of the Overworld and the Nether is inaccessible, so the effective area is 2 tiles less on both axes.

After a world has been created, it can be expanded to a larger size. Larger worlds cannot be reverted to a smaller size. In this process, there is an option to "Overwrite World Edges", disabled by default. When enabled, newly-generated tiles overwrite the outer 32 tiles around the world. When disabled, increasing the world size does not replace any original tiles. Starting with a smaller world used to be beneficial, as one could choose to gradually expand when an update made changes to the world generation, and could therefore generate new chunks with new features. However, since updates were later discontinued on Legacy Console Edition, this benefit no longer exists.

''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'', and ''[[Wii U Edition]]'' do not have the option for world size. All worlds generated in these editions are Classic size, although it is possible to expand them if they are transferred to an edition that supports larger world sizes. More [[village]]s, [[ocean monument]]s,{{verify}} [[swamp hut]]s and [[woodland mansion]]s attempt to generate in Classic and Small than in Medium and Large. Additionally, the [[stronghold]] generates much closer to spawn in Classic and Small sizes than in Medium and Large.

The end dimension is fixed to a 192x192 block area (36,864 blocks, 12×12 chunks, 144 chunks) centered at 0,0, and one outer end island the same size 2048 blocks away from 0,0 in a cardinal direction (Total: 73,728 blocks, 288 chunks) . On ''Xbox One Edition'', ''PlayStation 4 Edition'', and ''Nintendo Switch Edition'', up to four outer islands the same size can generate on all cardinal directions 2048 blocks away from 0,0 (Total: 184,320 blocks, 720 chunks).

== New Nintendo 3DS Edition ==
The finite worlds of the ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' are based on the [[Old]] world type from {{el|be}}. The edges of both the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]] are surrounded by an invisible barrier, and the ratio of the Nether to the Overworld is 1:3 regardless of world size. It is not possible to change the size of a world after it has been created.

Unlike Legacy Console Edition, world size limits worlds are centered at the spawn point of the world seed, not centered at coordinate 0,0. Biome size is the same across all world sizes, matching that of default {{el|PE}} worlds, unlike Legacy Console Edition where biome size scale can be changed independently of world size. Structure placement is also the same across world sizes. 

Unlike the Nether and the Overworld, [[the End]] dimension is always centered at coordinate 0,0. This causes an invisible barrier to generate in the same location as the edge of the Overworld. In some cases, the barrier can cut through the central End island or outer End islands.

The map grid is not aligned to the world generation, unlike Legacy Console Edition, where its maps are aligned to world size.
