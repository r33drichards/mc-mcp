An '''iceberg''' is a [[feature]] composed of [[packed ice]] and/or [[blue ice]].

== Generation ==
The "iceberg feature" (called a '''cone iceberg''') generates a small iceberg, shaped like a rounded upside-down cone, or an ice cream cone. The "[[Terrain features#Iceberg|iceberg terrain feature]]" (a '''large iceberg''') generates a large, mountainous iceberg.

Cone icebergs generate in [[frozen ocean]]s and [[deep frozen ocean]]s. They can consist of [[packed ice]], [[blue ice]], and [[snow block]]s.

=== Variants ===
==== Composition ====
Most cone icebergs are made of packed ice. Each cone iceberg has:

* a 30% probability to be topped with snow (snow-capped). The snow is about 1 block thick
* an {{frac|1|200}}{{Only|je|short=1}} or {{frac|1|100}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}} [[w:Independence_(probability_theory)|independent]] probability to try be a {{Section link||Blue ice}} iceberg

This means that {{frac|3|2000}} cone icebergs are snow-capped blue ice icebergs {{in|java}}, or {{frac|3|1000}} {{in|bedrock}}.

The iceberg has a 30%{{only|java|short=1}} or 20%{{only|bedrock|short=1}} probability to be elliptic, and is circular otherwise.

==== Shape ====
Cone icebergs have two types:

* circular (circle-shaped)
* elliptic (ellipse-shaped)

==== Dimensions ====
A circular iceberg has a random radius from <code>0-11</code>. Its max height above sea level is:
* 90% probability:
** <code>3-17</code>{{only|java|short=1}} or <code>3-13</code>{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* 10% probability (mutually exclusive):
** <code>10-42</code>{{only|java|short=1}} or <code>10-34</code>{{only|bedrock|short=1}}

The max depth below sea level is:
* <code>3-18</code>

An elliptic iceberg has:
* a semimajor axis of <code>7-11</code>{{only|java|short=1}} or <code>8-15</code>{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* a semiminor axis of <code>3-5</code>
* a max height above sea level of <code>6-11</code>{{only|java|short=1}} or <code>6-9</code>{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* a max depth below sea level of <code>6-18</code>

=== Carving ===
Carved icebergs are variations of icebergs with a recess or crater on side or bottom of an iceberg. Carvings serve no known purpose but to add character to icebergs.

Each circular iceberg has a 30% probability of being carved.

Each elliptic iceberg  has a 90% chance of being carved.

=== Spacing ===
Each [[chunk]] (of a valid ocean) has an {{frac|1|16}} {{only|java|short=1}} or {{frac|1|8}} {{only|bedrock|short=1}} probability to try to generate a cone iceberg.

=== Blue ice ===
Some packed ice icebergs sometimes have [[Blue Ice (feature)|blue ice features]] attached to them. A blue ice feature is a pile of blue ices that generates adjacent to a [[packed ice]], typically at the bottom of the iceberg.
