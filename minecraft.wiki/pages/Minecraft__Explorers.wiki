== Cards ==

A set of ''Minecraft: Explorers'' includes<ref>[https://www.ravensburger.us/spieleanleitungen/ecm/Spielanleitungen/21580%20anl%206%202364132.pdf ''Minecraft: Explorers'' instruction sheet]</ref>:

A set of 110 cards, which includes:

* One Game Over card
* Sixty landscape cards
* Twelve chest cards
* One night card
* Six hunger cards
* Thirty mob cards, split across the following six mobs:
** Six zombies
** Six skeletons
** Six spiders
** Four creepers
** Four witches
** Four endermen

== Setup ==

First, shuffle the landscape cards with the landscape side face up. Then, the top five cards are laid out in the middle of the play area.

Next, the mob cards are shuffled face down, and the following amount of mob cards are placed back in the game box without looking, depending on the number of players:

{| class="wikitable" style="width: auto; text-align: center"
! Number of players
! Number of cards returned
|-
| 1
| 8
|-
| 2
| 7
|-
| 3
| 6
|-
| 4
| 5
|}

The remaining mob cards are stacked and the "Game Over" card is then shuffled into the bottom four cards of the stack. Then, the top card of the mob stack is revealed and placed next to the mob card pile.

Finally, the amount of chests to be filled are determined depending on the difficulty of the game:

{| class="wikitable" style="width: auto; text-align: center"
! Difficulty
! Number of chests to fill
|-
| Easy
| 5
|-
| Normal
| 6
|-
| Hard
| 7
|-
| Hardcore
| 8
|}

The drawn chests are laid out with the open chest face up, and the remaining chests are placed back in the game box.

== Rules ==

=== Official rules ===

The objective of the game is to fill all but one chest, depending on difficulty, with the respective items.

The player who most recently played ''Minecraft'' is the starting player, and is given the night card and the six hunger cards.

During a turn, the player is allowed to perform various actions, with each action costing a certain number of hunger points. Hunger points can be used by discarding the hunger cards in the player's possession. The player is allowed to perform any action in any order and as many times as allowed, unless they no longer have the necessary hunger points, in which case their turn ends. Play proceeds to the left of the starting player once the other player has completed their actions. There are four types of actions a player can perform.

=== Actions ===

==== Explore landscapes and get items ====

For a player to explore a landscape, they must pay the number of hunger points shown on the landscape card. Then, the respective card is flipped over to show what item the player obtained, followed by the player taking the item and placing it in front of them as part of their "inventory". Players are allowed to have as many items as possible, and can use items with special abilites in the same turn or save them for later turns.

If a landscape card has a pickaxe or a sword, then the player with the respective item in their inventory can use it to explore, in addition to paying less hunger points depending on the type of tool (e.g. A diamond tool removes four hunger points from the cost).

If a landscape card shows an icon of a skeleton skull and crossbones, there is a possibility that hostile mobs may appear. The player doesn't know how many, however, until the landscape card is flipped over. If the icon of the skeleton skull and crossbones does appear on the back, the player must immediately draw the number of mobs depicted on the back of the card and place them on the table. If the final mob is a mob that is already being displayed, they continue to reveal mob cards until a card is drawn that does not have a mob being displayed.

If a landscape card shows a village, the player is allowed to trade with a villager provided that they pay one hunger point in addition to the item that the villager needs (e.g. To trade for a diamond pickaxe, the player must pay one hunger point in addition to giving the villager an emerald or a lighting item). The requested item from the player's "inventory" is then placed in a discard pile.

==== Reveal new landscapes ====

For a player to reveal new landscapes, they must spend one hunger point. The player then decides for the remaining landscape cards that are face up to leave them as is or put them at the bottom of the pile. Once that is done, new landscape cards are drawn until five cards are placed at the center of the table.

==== Fight mobs and get trophies ====

For a player to fight a mob on display, they pay the number of hunger points indicated on the mob card. A sword from the player's inventory may also be used to reduce the number of hunger points needed to pay to fight the mob. Once the mob is "defeated", it is added to the player's "inventory" as a "trophy". Two of the same mobs may be used as one hunger point for any action as necessary.

==== Fill chests ====

For a player to fill chests, they must spend one hunger point. Then, any number of the requested items the player has for the respective chests are put in them. Once the chests are filled with the requested items, the chest card is turned over, allowing the player, if a mob is on display, to fight and defeat the mob without paying any hunger points.

=== End of the turn ===

At the end of the player's turn, they must discard the night card from their hand, which will cause a mob to appear immediately. The player must reveal the top card from the mob deck and place it next to the deck. If a mob that is revealed is already on display, the player continues to draw mob cards until a mob that is not on display is revealed.

=== Special items ===

Each items a player obtains has abilities as follows:

* {{ItemSprite|Sword}} or {{ItemSprite|Pickaxe}} '''Tools:''' Tools may be used to perform actions at reduced prices. A damaged tool is even allowed to be put in a chest when necessary.

* {{ItemSprite|Apple}} '''Food:''' Food is used to get extra hunger points for the player's current turn. Food may also be put in a chest when necessary, however the food item put in may no longer be used.

* {{ItemSprite|Crossbow}} '''Crossbow:''' Crossbows may be used to fight two mobs without paying any hunger points. The two mobs fought are then put into the player's "inventory".

* {{BlockSprite|Oak Wood}}/{{ItemSprite|Iron Ingot}} '''Wood and Iron:''' Wood is usually found in forests, while iron is generally found in caves. These items may be used for trading with villagers or put into chests when necessary.

* {{ItemSprite|Iron Chestplate}} '''Armor:''' Armor protects the player from mobs for one turn. The player puts the armor piece on the discard pile, preventing them from revealing mobs for that turn.

* {{ItemSprite|Spyglass}} '''Spyglass:''' Spyglasses may be used to reveal the landscape cards that are currently on display for the player to take note, and the cards are then turned back over.

* {{ItemSprite|Ocean Explorer Map}}/{{ItemSprite|Totem of Undying}}/{{BlockSprite|Wet Sponge}} '''Explorer Map, Totem of Undying, and Wet Sponge:''' The explorer map may be used to search for woodland mansions or ocean monuments, which contain a totem of undying and a wet sponge, respectively. However, those two items have no use in the game apart from placing them in chests. Both locations only exist once.

* '''Furnishings and Lighting:''' If a chest or villager asks for furnishing or lighting (depicted by symbols of a house and the sun, respectively), the player will need to find the appropriate decorative items, such as a bookshelf or a jack 'o' lantern, to put in a chest or give to a villager.

=== End of the game ===

The player(s) win when all but one chest is filled with the requested items. However, if the "Game Over" card is revealed, the player(s) lose.
