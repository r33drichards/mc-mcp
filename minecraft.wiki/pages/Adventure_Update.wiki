The '''Adventure Update''' is the name of two major themed updates for {{el|je}}, and focused on aspects such as combat, exploration, and adventure. The first part was released as [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]] on September 14, 2011 which focused on the new [[hunger]] feature, terrain and structure generation, and a new mob. The second part was released as official release [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]] on November 18, 2011, adding [[potions]], [[enchantments]], and the new [[End]] dimension with an entirely optional final boss.

It was announced on June 10, 2011 by [[Notch]], and was initially planned to be implemented in [[Java Edition Beta 1.7]].<ref>{{WON|6385865216|Post E3 information dump!|June 10, 2011}}</ref> An early version of the Adventure Update was playable by fans at [[Mojang]]'s booth at PAX Prime 2011, which was held between August 26 and 28.<ref>{{tweet|notch|106630233364496384|Files have been copied to a USB stick.
