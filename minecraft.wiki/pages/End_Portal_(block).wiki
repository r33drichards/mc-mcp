The '''End portal''' block is a block generated when an [[End portal]] or [[exit portal]] is activated, which teleports the player between the [[Overworld]] and [[the End]].

== Obtaining ==
The End portal block cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. The item form is non-existent {{in|java}}, but it can be obtained through [[add-on]]s, external editors or by using bugs {{in|bedrock}}.

The End portal block can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}} or simply by [[End Portal#Creation|building End portals]].

== Usage ==
End portal blocks can be used to teleport into and out of [[the End]]. When a player or other entity in the [[Overworld]] or the End touches an End portal block, it is instantly taken to the other dimension. If a single portal block is placed using commands, it can still be used to travel between dimensions.

All entities traveling to the End appear on the [[obsidian platform]], recreating it if necessary. Players traveling to the Overworld appear at their [[individual spawn point]], while other entities appear at the [[world spawn point]].

{{IN|bedrock}}, non-player entities travelling to the overworld will appear at Y-level -64 due to a bug.<ref>{{Bug|MCPE-157125|3=Non-player entities teleport to the void when transported from the End to the Overworld}}</ref>

=== Properties ===
*[[Entities]] which touch the End portal (who have already seen the [[credits]]) are teleported to another dimension:
** If the block is in the [[Overworld]], [[the Nether]], or in a [[custom dimension]], the entity is teleported to the [[obsidian platform]] in the End.
** If the block is in [[the End]], they are teleported to their spawn point:
*** Players with an unobstructed [[individual spawn point|respawn location]] (set by using a [[bed]] or [[respawn anchor]]) are teleported to that location.
*** Players whose respawn location is unset or obstructed are teleported to a small area centered on the [[world spawn]] point.
*** All other entities (aside from the exceptions listed below) are teleported exactly to the world spawn point.
** {{IN|Java}}, ridden entities and their passengers can use End portals (and [[nether portal (block)|Nether portal]]s); {{In|Bedrock}}, they cannot.
*** However, {{in|Java}}, if an entity ridden by a player who has not yet seen the [[credits]] enters an End portal in the End, the entity will not be teleported to the world spawn.
** [[Ender dragon]]s cannot use End portals.
** [[Wither]]s can use End portals only {{in|Bedrock}}.
*End portal blocks can be destroyed in [[Creative]] mode. This does not affect adjacent End portal blocks.
*The top surface of an End portal is {{frac|3|4}} the height of a full block.{{verify|still the case 21w13a+?}}
*The End portal is one of the only blocks without a conventional texture or entity texture; it instead duplicates and layers a star-field pattern that follows the player's cursor.
*If [[TNT]] is detonated on an End portal, no blocks in its blast radius are destroyed.
*If the End portal block is generated in the block grid using the [[debug mode]] world type, it teleports the player to the Overworld regardless of which dimension it is in.
*{{IN|be}}, it's impossible to see the texture of the End portal block when the player is under it.
If a player has not seen the [[credits]] yet, they are unloaded, and shown the credits sequence. Then, they are teleported following the steps above.

=== Piston interactivity ===
End portal blocks cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.
