'''Will Arnett is Hosting MINECON Earth!''' is a live action skit announcing the hosts of [[MINECON Earth 2017]].

== Summary ==
While in a green office room surounded by random paintings, [[Lydia Winters]] agrees to propose "Pajama Fridays" for the [[Mojang]] staff. Moving on to the next assignment, she invites the three other people in the room to watch her iPad, where she has received a vmail she finds interesting. It's none other than [[Will Arnett]], who gets hung-up on the pronunciation of the company's name. 

He comes asking if they have any way of training him to become good at ''[[Minecraft]]'', accidentally conceding it's because of his children. Apparently, he feels envy towards their prowess and wants to be better than them. Alternatively, he claims to want to impress them. Desperate, he begins listing off various things he would do if they promise him support, the offers tempting the staff. However, Lydia instead has the idea to get him to host their new event, revealing a pop-up book of him and herself.

In a post-credits scene, the four are fascinated by the paper, [[Vu Bui]] shouting "like!"

{{Quote|...with Lydia Winters, of course! Our best MINECON yet will be streaming live on November 18 - save the date!|Video description|image=YouTube logo.svg}}

{{Quote|Will's appeared in tons of movies and TV shows, like A Series of Unfortunate Events, Despicable Me, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and this year's excellent LEGO Batman. Plus, if you Google 'Will Arnett dressed as a banana' the results are as delightful as you'd hope. Will tells us he's keen to develop his Minecraft skills and what better way to do that than co-hosting MINECON? Actually, we can think of lots of better ways, but we're still thrilled that he's co-hosting with Lydia!|[[Tom Stone]]<ref>{{Mcnet|will-arnett-hosting-minecon-earth|Will Arnett is hosting MINECON Earth!|October 19, 2017|Tom Stone}}</ref>|image=Tom Stone Mojang avatar.png}}
