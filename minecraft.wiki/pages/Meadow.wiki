The '''meadow''' is an elevated grassy [[mountain]] slope [[biome]] filled with patches of [[flower]]s, turquoise-green [[grass]] and [[tall grass]], where [[sheep]], [[donkey]]s and [[rabbit]]s spawn.

== Description ==
The meadow is the most common mountain biome, covering 1.19% of the Overworld's surface area.

The meadow is a high altitude counterpart to the [[plains]] biome. All small [[flower]]s generate except [[blue orchid]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[lilies of the valley]], [[torchflower]]s, [[Eyeblossom|eyeblossoms]], or [[wither rose]]s. Rarely, a lone oak or [[birch tree]] of any size can generate and always has a [[bee nest]]. Both [[pillager outposts]] and [[plains village]]s can generate in this biome, making this the only mountain biome where villages can generate. {{IN|java}}, unlike most overworld biomes, [[sugar cane]]s and [[pumpkin]] patches cannot generate here.

Just like other mountain biomes, [[emerald ore]]s can be found in meadows, especially at higher altitudes, and both [[Coal ore|coal]] and [[iron ore]]s are commonly found here. [[Infested block]] [[Ore (feature)|blobs]] also naturally generate in meadows.

This biome usually generates in the lower sides of some mountains but can also generate standalone in plateaus, mainly next to [[plain]]s and separated from [[cherry grove]]s, regular [[forest]]s, regular [[birch forest]], or regular [[taiga]]s by [[river]]s.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
