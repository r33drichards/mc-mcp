'''12w08a''' is the eighth and the final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.2.1]], released on February 23, 2012,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/minecraft-snapshot-12w08a/|title=Minecraft Snapshot 12w08a|website=Mojang.com|author=Jens Bergensten|date=February 23, 2012}}</ref> which adds [[iron golem]]s and debug camera controls.

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Iron Golem JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Iron golem]]s'''
* New utility mob.
* One iron golem may spawn in a [[village]] for every 16 [[villager]]s
* Can also be spawned by arranging 4 [[iron block]]s and a [[pumpkin]].

=== General ===
'''Controls'''
* Added camera controls.
** These were accidentally added. Jeb noted them as "deadmau5 camera" controls and would likely be removed again in an upcoming snapshot.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|172982497104240640}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|jeb|172983022038163456}}</ref>
** Pressing {{key|F6}} causes the player to get "stuck" to the camera until F6 is pressed again. This allows players to appear to phase into blocks.
** Pressing {{key|F9}} causes the camera to freeze in its position, allowing to see the player model rotating in third person view.
** Pressing {{key|Y}}, {{key|H}}, {{key|U}}, {{key|O}}, {{key|I}}, {{key|K}}, {{key|J}}, {{key|L}}, {{key|N}} and {{key|M}} change the camera positioning in a variety of ways. While pressing two functionally connected keys at the same time the camera may be reset (example: {{key|Y}} + {{key|H}} reverts that view back to normal, but {{key|U}} + {{key|O}} does not).

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Stairs]]'''
* Can now be placed upside-down.

=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Lava ponds and flat stone areas now generate on the surface more frequently.

=== General ===
'''[[Language]]s'''
* Removed some Canadian English stereotypes.

== Fixes ==
'''1 bug fixed'''
* Fixed [[the End]] and [[cavern]]s generation.</onlyinclude>
