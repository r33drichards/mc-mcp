'''Invalid data value cacti''' are item forms of the [[cactus]] block with damage values outside of the usual range which cactus can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value cacti are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Endermen ===
The growth state of a cactus block is stored in the block's metadata as a value from 0 to 15. When an [[enderman]] picks up a cactus, this value is saved, and when killed, it will drop an item with that metadata value set as its damage. For 0, this is a normal cactus, but any value from 1 to 15 will result in an invalid data value cactus.<ref>{{YouTube link|5Rs_gcfXc14|The Infamous Glitched Cactus &#124; Unobtained S2 E26|PuffingFish|November 13, 2020}}</ref>

The first version this is possible in is 15w31a (when endermen became capable of dropping held blocks), and the last version is 16w21b, as the first pre-release for 1.10 fixed this issue.

Note that while there are 15 distinct possible invalid cactus variants, there is no way to tell in-game which cactus is obtained; damage is not listed after the block's numeric ID if advanced tooltips are enabled, and all cacti will stack with each other regardless of damage value, making collecting each individual type difficult. Only external tools will display the damage associated with these items.

=== Stacking ===
As cacti as an item do not track their damage value for any purpose, invalid data value cacti can be created by picking up dropped normal cacti with an incomplete stack of invalid data value cacti already in the inventory, as well as merging together existing item stacks. This can also result in invalid data value cacti being converted to non-anomalous cacti in the same way, and therefore care should be taken when transporting such items. As such, if collection of all 15 different types of cacti is desired, they should be stored in a storage container such as a [[chest]] in different slots via manual placement - shift-clicking should be avoided.

== Usage ==

=== Placement ===
{{empty section}}

=== Potted cacti ===
Unlike placement in the world as a block, invalid data value cacti placed inside a [[flower pot]] will preserve their metadata, and breaking the potted cactus will drop a cactus with that specific damage value.<ref>{{YouTube link|HSo1hpKE4Tw|To Infinity and Beyond!- ProtoTech SMP #13 &#124; Ray's Works|Rays Works|December 16, 2016|t=5m35s}}</ref>

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java alpha}}
|{{HistoryLine||v1.0.6|Cactus has been added. Invalid data variants exist as a consequence of how block and item metadata is handled.
|Since damage values use the value which tools use for durability, invalid cactus items have a durability bar.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4|The durability bar has been removed from cacti with higher damage values.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w25a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE1.png|32px}} With the introduction of data-driven item models, any item with a data value outside of what is accepted by the game has no model to point to, resulting in use of the [[Missing textures and models|missing item model]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w30a|Invalid data value cacti, alongside other invalid data value items, now appear the size of a full block when held in third person or by another player or mob.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w31a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE2.png|32px}} The missing model's inventory appearance has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value sandstone also changing.
|The items also appear the size of a full block when held in first person and when dropped on the ground, and also appear larger than before in an [[item frame]].
|As endermen now drop the block they are holding, invalid data value cacti are now legitimately obtainable in Survival mode.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.10|dev=pre1|Endermen no longer drop invalid data value cacti.<ref>{{bug|MC-98430||Endermen forces cacti to have a missing texture|Fixed}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w43a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE3.png|32px}} The missing texture has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value sandstone also changing.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=17w47a|Numeric IDs for blocks and items have been completely removed from the game. As a result, invalid data value cactus has been "removed" as any such item now converts cleanly into regular cactus.}}
