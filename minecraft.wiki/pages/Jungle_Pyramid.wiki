A '''jungle pyramid'''<ref group="fn"><code>jungle_pyramid</code> is the in-game structure ID {{in|java}}.</ref> or '''jungle temple''' is an above ground [[structure]] found in [[jungle]] biomes built mostly of [[cobblestone]] and [[mossy cobblestone]]. The jungle pyramid contains two loot [[chest]]s, one at the end of a hallway of [[arrow]] traps and one hidden behind a [[lever]] puzzle.

== Generation ==
Jungle pyramids can generate in [[jungle]]s, but not [[sparse jungle]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-238558|||WAI}}</ref> {{iN|JE}}, they can also generate in [[bamboo jungle]]s.

Jungle pyramids can be located with jungle [[explorer map]]s, which are sold by [[desert]], [[savanna]] and [[swamp]] cartographer [[villager]]s.

{{Calculator|chunkbase|pois=J|zoom=0.25}}

== Structure ==
{{main|/Structure}}
Jungle pyramids consist of [[cobblestone]], [[mossy cobblestone]], and [[vines]]. There are 3 floors. 

It is possible to find blocks that normally generate outside the pyramid (like [[leaves]]) appearing inside, possibly blocking the [[chest]]s or [[dispenser]]s, or interrupting the [[redstone]].

=== Puzzle ===
{{main|Tutorial:Defeating temples#Jungle pyramid}}
On the bottom floor, there is a puzzle consisting of 3 [[lever]]s on 3 [[chiseled stone bricks]] connected to a hidden [[piston]] mechanism. If the combination is entered correctly, a block on the main floor is pulled away, revealing a chest.

=== Trap ===
Down the hall from the puzzle, there is another chest. There are two [[tripwire]] lines connected to dispensers with 2–14 [[arrow]]s, hidden behind vines. The first tripwire is in the middle of the hallway and the second tripwire is around the corner in front of the chest. Walking over the tripwire triggers the dispenser attached to it. Breaking the tripwire with anything other than [[shears]] also triggers it.
