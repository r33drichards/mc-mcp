'''Build 0016''' (or '''Build 1.66.0016.0''') is the earliest known development version of {{edition|xbox 360}}. It was showcased at [[MINECON 2011]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkHQ_lQIsSI Minecraft: Marketplace Showcase] – Minecraft on Twitch</ref><ref>{{ytl|CFmXVjaFdCU|Extended Xbox 360 Minecraft playthrough|CurseNetwork|November 29, 2011}}</ref> and is based on [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]].

== Features ==
* All features from and before [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]], written in C++ instead of Java.
* Console-exclusive controls and menus.
* Includes a [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial|tutorial world]].
* Exclusive graphics specifically relating to MINECON 2011, such as an overlay displaying "Work In Progress" and a small graphic logo at the top left.

== Differences ==
* The [[Chat|chat box]] in this version more closely resembled ''[[Java Edition]]''<nowiki/>'s, due to the larger font size and the background being smaller, not casting all the way to the right like the final version does.<gallery widths="320" heights="160">
