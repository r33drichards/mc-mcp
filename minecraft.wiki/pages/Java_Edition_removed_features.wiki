{{outdated|edition=java|These features only exist in outdated versions of ''Java Edition''.}}

Since the beginning of the development of {{JE}}, there have been a number of features that were removed from the game. These features may have been replaced, or a developer decided against the feature later on.

'''Note:''' This page documents only game features that were removed; features of a particular game element that were removed are noted in that element's history. See [[Java Edition unused features]] for features that are still currently in the game.

=== Score indicator showing in-game ===
In [[Survival Test]] and early [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] versions, the score was displayed in the upper right corner.

This was removed in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100130]].

=== Player stats ===
[[File:RemovedPlayerStats.png|thumb|The removed player stats.]]

In early [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] versions, the player could open the [[inventory]] screen and view their name and three stats: "ATK", "DEF", and “SPD”, probably standing for attack, defense, and speed. These existed only briefly; when asked, Notch stated he could not remember exactly why they were implemented and subsequently removed, and he assumed they were placeholders for "vague plans".<ref>{{reddit|6xkzsp/til_in_early_versions_of_indev_there_were_player|dmgtdr8|I don't even remember putting them in, I assume it was only printed out on that screen as a placeholder for vague plans. I don't think they were ever in the code.|xNotch|September 7, 2017}}</ref>

=== Inventory changes ===
An inventory rewrite was originally partially implemented in snapshot [[14w07a]], but it was reverted before the release of [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]].{{more info|when reverted?}}<ref>{{reddit|31z5gz/dinnerbone_working_with_inventories|cq6k74n|context=2|We never finished that. We hit a roadblock with the inventory rewrite, and had to shelve it because we couldn't figure out how to proceed nicely.|Dinnerbone|April 9, 2015}}</ref>

=== Arrow indicator ===
During [[Java Edition Survival Test|Survival Test]] and early [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] versions, an arrow indicator appeared above the hotbar which indicated how many arrows player has left.

=== Eating increases health ===
Prior to [[Java Edition Beta 1.8]] before hunger bar was added, eating food directly increased health.

=== Sword blocking ===
{{Main article|Sword blocking}}
It was possible to use a [[sword]] in main-hand to block attacks with right click. This feature was removed in 1.9 and attacks are now blocked with [[shield]] instead.

=== Old multiplayer player death animation ===
Before [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]], on player death while playing in multiplayer, the player would stay standing, leap a little bit, and then disappear. In 1.6.1, this was replaced with the player falling onto the side and then disappearing.

=== Custom player skin reverting to the default Steve skin on death ===
Before the [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]] update, custom player skins would revert to the default Steve skin on the death screen. This feature was removed sometime during the 1.6 full release update's development.

=== First-person view pivot ===
{{missing information|section|what this feature actually was}}

Removed in [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]] for performance reasons. Before changed, the player could not look directly upwards or downwards.

=== Notch dropping an apple ===
Before [[Java Edition 1.3.1|1.3.1]], players named "[[Notch]]" would drop an [[apple]] along with the rest of their inventory upon death. Apples were otherwise unobtainable before [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release|Beta 1.8 Pre-release]].

=== On-screen version number ===
[[File:Numerical Display.png|thumb|Version display in the top left of the screen ([[Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3]]).]]
[[File:Exclusive All Text Display.png|thumb|All-text version display in the top left of the screen ([[PC Gamer Demo]]).]]
Starting with [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.2a|Classic 0.0.2a]], all subsequent versions until [[Java Edition RC2|RC2]] had text displayed in the top left corner of the screen that displayed the version. Versions between [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.5|Beta 1.6.5]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3|Beta 1.7.3]] did not have this text. From [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.2a|Classic 0.0.2a]] to [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100206-1437|Indev 0.31 20100206-1437]], only the version number was displayed, but after [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] it switched from being "[[0.31]]" to being called "[[Minecraft Indev]]" ([[Java Edition Indev 20100206-2034|Indev 20100206-2034]]), the word "Minecraft" was shown before the version number. In the [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] development stage, the text read "Minecraft Alpha v#.#.#(_0#)." In the [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] development stage, the text read "Minecraft Beta #.#(_0#)." This feature was only partially removed, for, among other things, the version number can now be shown by opening the [[debug screen]] while in-game. Before [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2|Alpha v1.2.2]], the version number did not display on the [[main menu]] screen.
{{-}}

=== "Unlicensed Copy" message ===
[[File:Unlicenced Copy.png|thumb|"Unlicensed Copy" message in the top left of the screen ([[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3]]).]]
From [[Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3|Beta 1.6 Test Build 3]] to [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3|Beta 1.7.3]], a message reading "Minecraft Beta #.#.#(_0#) Unlicensed Copy :( (Or logged in from another location). Purchase at [[minecraft.net]]" was shown in the top-left corner if the player was detected to be running an unlicensed or cracked version of the game.{{more info needed|Under what specific conditions is the game considered unlicensed?}} This would also force the version number to be displayed, including in [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.5|Beta 1.6.5]] and later which normally had the version number hidden. The message was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]].
{{-}}

=== Achievements ===
[[Achievement/Java Edition|Achievements]] were available between [[Java Edition Beta 1.5|Beta 1.5]] and full release [[Java Edition 1.11.2|1.11.2]] (snapshot [[17w06a]]). They were ultimately replaced by [[advancement]]s. Editions other than ''Java Edition'' still have achievements instead, although they use a different system, being synced per Xbox Live or PlayStation account and not separated by worlds.

=== Old walking animation for players ===
Before [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.9|Alpha v1.0.9]], the walking animation for the player and the human mob was different; the player and the human mob would swing their arms wildly to their sides while walking like cartoons.

=== Pre-loaded items ===
Different versions in Minecraft's history had items pre-spawned in the player's inventory. Here is a table below:

Since [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], creating a new world in [[Creative]] mode no longer spawns the player with any items in their inventory.

== High-distance anomalies ==
Many of the game's mechanics would break down in strange ways when at a large distance from the origin of the world. The vast majority of these effects have been patched, or at least minimised, in modern versions.

=== Hard limits ===
{{main|Java Edition hard limits}}
For elements of the game which are integer-aligned, such as the positions of blocks, Java Edition uses integer data types, which can be either 32-bit or 64-bit. 32-bit integers were more commonly used in older versions, which allowed for 4,294,967,296 possible distinct integer values, ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Exceeding these boundaries, such as by using an external editor to move the player to beyond 2,147,483,647 blocks from the origin as to force the game to load blocks beyond this position, often would result in major game-breaking bugs and crashes.

Accessing such regions is now much more difficult than it was previously, as distance is now much more restrictive, requiring modifications to the game to allow these limits to be exposed.

=== Floating point imprecision ===
For elements of the game which are not integer-aligned, such as the positions of entities, Java Edition uses 64-bit floating point (or "double") values for arithmetic and storage of relevant variables. However, there are odd cases in which a 32-bit floating point value is used instead. Such cases are rare in the modern game (a full list of those which still exist in 1.20 can be found at [[Java Edition distance effects]]), however older versions of the game used 32-bit values (or unnecessarily casted from and to them, resulting in data loss which could have easily been avoided without this pointless casting) much more heavily, resulting in a plethora of strange gameplay bugs which were tied to how far the player was from the center of the world, getting twice as intense for every integer power of 2 blocks the player went from the center.

[[File:World rendering precision loss.gif|right|thumb|The rendering precision loss bug, one of the more famous float bugs.]]
One of the most notable floating point precision loss bugs is where the rendering of the world stops being accurate depending on the player's position. Commonly experienced alongside (and frequently, and incorrectly, blamed on) the Far Lands, the position at which blocks render does not match up with that of entities and other world elements such as the [[hitbox]]es of blocks. At 8,388,608 blocks and beyond, the game assumes the player is standing at the edge or corner of each block, and always renders the blocks of the world as if they player is standing at one of those corners. This effect is difficult to describe in text, and is best experienced firsthand.

Most of the other issues regarding floating point imprecision deal with the creation of particles, spawning of entities, and (prior to their standardisation in 1.8 with json files, which fixed all of these permanently) the geometrical distortion of block models.

A comprehensive list of since-fixed issues, as well as breakdowns of how they progress, can be found at [[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects]].

=== Boundary effects ===
{{main|World boundary}}

Boundary effects refer to oddities which arise due to hardcoded numerical limits in the game, such as the 30 million wall (as opposed to hard limits, which are defined by the programming language and/or computer architecture rather than the game code).

The current world boundary as of 1.21 is a "pseudo-wall" which exists at 30 million blocks from the origin, a chunk beyond the [[world border]]. (This is defined as a "pseudo-wall" rather than a true wall as rather than being solid and preventing passage like the world border or a solid block does, the player's position is instead set to 30 million by the game if the player attempts to exceed it, which can be seen by the fact that the walking animation, step sounds and view bobbing can still be experienced by walking into the wall, as does the sounds of flying with an elytra.)

However, previous versions had much stranger effects at great distances. The world boundary was something commonly experienced in Classic and Indev due to worlds being small by design. The first versions of Infdev, which did away with such boundaries, therefore had no such effects, instead exposing the existing hard limits of the game (although experiencing these was effectively impossible due to floating point bugs rendering the game unplayable much earlier).

The version of Infdev released on March 13, 2010 reimplemented a boundary at 32 million blocks, likely to prevent access to the then-relatively-new Far Lands which existed at a bit over 33 million blocks. This boundary was considerably different and buggier than those from Indev, although this was largely to be expected due to it being effectively impossible to reach legitimately. Beyond this 32 million limit, blocks would no longer exist at all, and give way to an empty void. When [[History of world generation|major changes to world generation]] brought the Far Lands much closer to the world origin later that same month, however, the world boundary still remained at 32 million, meaning the Far Lands were completely possible to reach without modding the game.

[[File:InfdevFarBeyond32000000.png|right|thumb|Looking back at the world from beyond the 32 million limit.]]
Updating blocks next to this void would cause the game to freeze due to it having to calculate an immense amount of lighting updates. This void could still be traversed by entities normally until the April 13 build, in which entities that render it would become stuck in place and jitter eternally. This was later fixed in an unknown version.

In Alpha v1.2.0, the boundary effects would get stranger than before. While previously no blocks would render beyond this point, Alpha v1.2.0 and onwards would cause a strange phenomenon in which chunks would appear to generate, but would be intangible, appear fully lit, and generated features such as trees and ores would not generate at all in these chunks.

[[File:Fake chunks ocean.png|right|thumb|The corner of the world in 1.0.0.]]
For reasons which remain completely unknown to this day, Beta 1.8 would shrink the world boundaries inwards from 32 million blocks out to only 30 million blocks out. While the effects would remain similar, with blocks beyond the 30 million boundary appearing fully lit and ignoring collision and feature generation, these fake chunks would only generate a small distance out from this boundary, stopping at 30,000,064, or four chunks from the boundary. In addition, any entity attempting to surpass 30,000,032 would again be stuck in a jittery stasis, with players in particular having their heads twist unnaturally if looking around after this point (a bug that was patched in 12w03a, where facing direction would no longer change and preventing this unnatural twisting).

With the client-server split in snapshot 12w18a for 1.3 ([[Java Edition 1.3.1/List of broken features|a change which broke many other things about the game]]), the stasis bug was actually fixed, and fake chunks could be generated beyond the 30,000,064 point, allowing for the player to keep flying outwards until 32,000,000 blocks, where they would be kicked out of the game due to being in an illegal position, revealing that not all elements of the 32,000,000 limit had been removed from the game yet. 12w27a, a later snapshot for 1.3, would clamp nether portal positions to be within the 30 million limit.

1.7 and 1.8 started to make major changes to the world boundary to bring it to its modern state. 1.7 first made all blocks beyond 30 million completely solid, including air. Said wall could still be surpassed, however, by flying over it, as it only extended to the 32-bit limit on the Y-axis, allowing for 32 million blocks to be reached once more and the illegal position game crash triggered. The boundary became more unstable from version to version throughout 1.8's development, with the end result on its release being that chunks beyond 30 million blocks would no longer render, and teleporting beyond 30 million would crash the game. 1.9 would allow chunks beyond 30 million blocks to render once more, and prevent teleportation beyond 30 million blocks at all. Little has changed about the world boundary between this point and 1.21.

=== Far Lands ===
{{main|Far Lands (Java Edition)}}

==== Basic theory ====
The Far Lands were a complex terrain phenomenon which arise due to a major bug in terrain generation works. Generally, "far lands" are the result of what happens when a given [[noise generator]] exceeds the largest value it can handle, resulting in an integer overflow and resulting in the generated values reaching unnatural magnitudes. The term "Far Lands" in isolation most commonly refers to what results from "low noise" and "high noise" overflowing simultaneously.

===== What the Far Lands are not =====
{{:Far Lands/What the Far Lands are not}}

==== The Far Lands ====
[[File:Corner Far Lands.png|thumb|The "corner" of the Far Lands, at ±12,550,821 on both X and Z axes.]]
In their most well-known iteration, the Far Lands manifested as a sort of "wall" which would extend from the lowest point of the world to the very top. This wall contained a series of holes in it, with these holes reaching back almost infinitely, with only minor changes even after millions of blocks. The density of a cross-section of this wall was roughly 50%, with solid portions and hollow portions being around equal. Given their positions at the four sides of a world, there regions are often referred to as the "Edge Far Lands" when distinction from other regions of a world is necessary, and, due to their "Swiss cheese"-like formation, informally as "The Loop". 

Since the Far Lands existed on both the X and Z axes, it is entirely possible for them to "intersect" each other when surpassing their starting point on both axes. The resulting terrain, named the "Corner Far Lands" in analogy to the vertices of a square, is markedly different from that of the edge regions: the world appears to be solid layers of terrain arranged on top of each other with air gaps in between. Due to this distinctive morphology, the Corner Far Lands are also informally referred to as "The Stack". The terrain seen in these regions is comparable to that which is seen in [[the Nether]]. Often, major diagonal or oblique patterns can be seen within the generated terrain, which, if they exist, are especially obvious at the beginning of the corner Far Lands.

In the unmodified game, only four sets each of the edge and corner Far Lands can exist in a world, from the noise overflowing on the X and Z axes. However, game modifications can modify aspects of either chunk saving or terrain generation in ways that ultimately allows for noise to overflow on the Y axis as well. Such modifications reveal two more sets of Edge Far Lands for a total of six sets (corresponding to the faces of a cube), eight sets of Corner Far Lands from these Y axis Edge Far Lands intersecting X and Z axis Edge Far Lands for a total of twelve sets (corresponding to the edges of a cube), and new regions in which all three axes simultaneously overflow due to Y axis Edge Far Lands intersecting the existing Corner Far Lands, with eight of these regions in total (corresponding to the vertices of a cube). These regions, referred to as the "Vertex Far Lands", are incredibly unstable; sometimes these regions are completely solid, other times are completely empty, and other times still feature incredibly strange terrain atypical of even "The Loop" or "The Stack".

With default settings, the noise would overflow at twice the distance on the Y axis as it does on the X and Z axes, at around 25,101,640 blocks.

==== The Farther Lands ====
[[File:Edge farlands turning into farther lands.png|thumb|The Edge Far Lands are on the right, with the comparatively featureless Edge Farther Lands on the left.]]
The Farther Lands is the name given to another noise overflow which, by default, happens at a greater distance than the normal Far Lands. Whereas the usual Far Lands arise from the overflowing of "low noise" and "high noise", the Farther Lands sees "selector noise" break down instead. Low noise and high noise are two different noise generators which the game uses to generate the potential fundamental shape of terrain, whereas selector noise chooses whether low noise or high noise is used to actually generate the terrain at that given point. When the conventional Far Lands start, despite both low noise and high noise overflowing simultaneously, selector noise still functions normally, meaning that there is still a large amount of possible variation in the shape of the Far Lands.

When selector noise does eventually break, which happens at roughly 1,004,065,920 blocks from the world origin, it follows that the variation between low and high noise also breaks down. Like how the usual Far Lands is a series of straight tunnels, the Farther Lands divides the world into a series of straight regions, with low noise used exclusively in one region and high noise in others. As such, the variation usually seen in the Far Lands vanishes after the Farther Lands.

The Corner Farther Lands take this effect to an extreme: while the normal Corner Far Lands are rich in nuance, the Corner Farther Lands are almost devoid of it. The beginning of the corner makes this all the more obvious, and also highlights edge Farther Lands-corner Far Lands intersections, making the aforementioned straight line regions clear to see.

==== Before inf-20100327 ====
[[File:Overflowing old noise.png|thumb|The stone wall at 33,554,432 blocks from the origin in inf-20100227-1433.]]
Terrain generation was much simpler in versions before March 27, 2010. While in modern versions, the noise generator used for terrain is 3D, earlier versions used a purely 2D noise generator for the world instead. The resulting terrain was much more cliff-based as a result, and overhangs were an impossibility. In addition, noise incremented much slower than the modern noise generator does, resulting in it overflowing at 33,554,432 blocks out (coincidentally a power of 2).

Rather than featuring a series of holes, this noise generator instead created a huge, featureless wall as it broke, as the purely 2D nature of the noise forbids any overhangs from generating. This wall is completely solid stone and extends infinitely outwards when it starts. Occasionally, the faces of this wall may appear ridged like a radiator or heat sink, resulting in a slightly more gradual transformation of the terrain.

==== Further investigations ====
While largely removed as of Beta 1.8, simple modifications to the game can effectively reintroduce them, in which case they behave effectively identically to how they did before, but much more stable due to the fixing of the vast majority of high-distance precision loss effects in earlier versions which caused lag and hindered movement. In addition, several aspects of the Far Lands persisted into later versions:
*The Far Lands also existed on the y-axis at twice the distance as they did on the x-axis. While obviously unobservable due to blocks not being able to exist at all outside of a certain height range, abuse of the [[Old Customized]] world type in which the height scale is increased to absurd values could allow for the positive Y-axis Far Lands, or "Sky Far Lands", to generate within vanilla bounds without modding.
*Beta 1.8 fixed the Far Lands by adding code to the noise generator to have it repeat after a certain amount of units. It is possible to have the amount of times the generator repeats to itself overflow, although the effects of this are not possible to see in vanilla worlds (it would only break down after almost 54 quadrillion blocks). However, further exploitation of Old Customized to set the coordinate scale to even more ludicrous values brings this overflow point into vanilla bounds once more. As setting it to values like these causes normal terrain to become incredibly chaotic, the point at where it breaks is difficult to see.
**For low and high noise, these overflowed regions are called the Fartherer Lands, and for selector noise, the Farthest Lands.

Modding has allowed for y-axis Far and Farther Lands, the Fartherer and Farthest Lands, and 64-bit versions of the Far and Farther Lands (distinct from the Fartherer and Farthest Lands in while they appear at the same locations as them, they result from 64-bit noise breaking normally rather than the modulo that prevents 32-bit noise from breaking itself) to be seen in their natural habitats.

== Generated structures ==
=== Brick pyramid ===
{{main|Brick pyramid}}

Brick pyramids were tall experimental generated structures made up exclusively of [[bricks]]. They were added in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1414]] and they were removed from the game in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100327]].

These were entirely composed of bricks - the pyramids did not have any rooms inside, however caves could generate through them [[Java Edition Infdev 20100325-1640]] due to caves being able to generate through any blocks at the time (including trees and other structures they should not be able to).

These were most likely intended for testing structure generation in infinite worlds. As blocks did not drop items at the start of Infdev due to entity code still being reworked, brick blocks could not be collected from pyramids for most of their existence.

=== Starting house ===
{{main|Starting house}}

The starting house was a building which generated at the center of Indev maps. The player would spawn inside of the starting house when the world was first generated.

This structure was added in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100124-2119]], and was initially comprised of [[mossy cobblestone]], with two [[Torch]]es inside. The starting house was reworked in [[Java Edition Indev 20100213]], having a [[stone]] floor and walls made of [[oak planks]].

Early iterations of the starting house contained a series of chests, which would harbor almost every block and item in the entire game at that point. These chests went through a series of changes, before being removed from the starting house entirely in later iterations.

The starting house was removed at [[Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1414]] due to terrain generation being redone to accommodate infinite worlds, ditching the limited worlds of Indev and earlier.

=== Obsidian wall ===
{{main|Obsidian wall}}

In [[Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1414]], two obsidian walls generated in the world as to mark the orthogonal directions. One of these walls would appear where the X-axis was at 0, and another where the Z-axis was 0. The player would spawn at the point where these two walls intersected.

Like with the brick pyramids, these were a debugging feature, and were not implemented as a source of [[obsidian]] for players due to the inability for blocks to drop items at the time.

These walls would no longer generate as of [[Java Edition Infdev 20100313]].

=== Monolith ===
{{main|Monolith}}

Monoliths were a terrain bug which existed from late Infdev to late Alpha. Occurring when the noise generators for handling the shape of terrain output specific values, these structures would consist of the terrain being "inverted" in a given region of space. Outwardly, they appear as sheer stone cliffs which reach the top of the world. Ore and sediment [[ore (feature)|blob]]s could be seen to generate in the sides of these, as could water and lava [[spring]]s. Further examination of these reveal that the area underneath these monoliths is completely empty all the way down to the bedrock layers, further proving that the terrain is "inverted", as air regions and solid regions have completely switched places. [[Water]] would generate in this empty space below monoliths, as the game would consider any air space below a given point that did not belong to a cave or other structure as an "ocean", and fill it with water accordingly.

Due to being "inverted" sections of terrain, it is exceedingly likely that monoliths would generate up infinitely (or at least up until the vertical Far Lands) were they given sufficient space. Due to their version range, they were limited to 128 blocks. Monoliths could also fully enclose regions of normal terrain - when seen from below, these would appear as sheer cliffs, like all non-monolith terrain.

Monoliths came with the [[Java Edition Infdev 20100611]], which overhauled terrain a third time in the Infdev development period, they persisted up until [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2_01]]. Alpha v1.2.0 redid terrain generation once more, such that completely different noise generators were used for terrain, which no longer had the potential to cause these bugs. However, despite this, [[Old Customized]] worlds were still capable of generating monolith structures by defining a negative "Biome Scale Weight" value<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/AntVenom/comments/5kmsve/monoliths_consistently_spawning_in_certain_biomes/</ref> from snapshot [[14w17a]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]] to snapshot [[18w05a]] for [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], prior to the removal of the "Customized" world type altogether in the next 1.13 snapshot [[18w06a]]. Monoliths could also be generated from 1.16 to 1.17.1 by using customized worlds to set a biome's scale to a negative number.

=== Placeholder trees ===
{{main|Tree}}
There are several cases in the game in which unique species of tree use the logs and leaves primarily associated with other trees. Two prominent examples are pine trees, which use spruce logs and leaves, and swamp trees, which use oak logs and leaves, rather than either of these having dedicated blocks. As a result of this, they cannot be grown from saplings, and can only be encountered when generating new chunks.

In [[Java Edition 1.7.2]]'s development, when biomes were being added to the game, two trees were added to the then-new biomes which also reused the logs and leaves of existing trees. However, these were a temporary measure, as later in development, they were given logs and leaves of their own, alongside saplings, planks and further wood products.

Specifically, these were the acacia tree, and the dark oak tree. The acacia tree reused jungle logs and oak leaves, and dark oak trees used spruce logs and oak leaves.

=== Village aspects ===
{{main|Village}}
[[Village]]s have seen multiple changes in generation since their introduction. Due to these changes, some may consider villages which generated in previous versions, or at least certain buildings within them, as "removed" structures.

==== Old village ====
{{main|Village/Structures (old)}}

Old villages and old zombie villages could generate in plains, savanna, taiga, and desert [[biome]]s. The type of [[village]], and therefore the style of all structures within it, was determined by the biome where the village well was located. All village biome variants were essentially palette swaps of each other. The "old villages" were not known as such until [[Java Edition 1.14]].

==== Gravel roads ====
{{main|Village#Paths|Village/Structures (old)}}
Before [[Java Edition 1.10]], [[village]]s used [[gravel]] with [[cobblestone]] underneath to signify roads; however, in [[Java Edition 1.10]], [[grass path]]s were added to signify village roads. However, grass paths sensibly were only generated where they replaced [[grass blocks]], and gravel paths still existed until [[Java Edition 1.14]], when the [[jigsaw]] system broke it.<ref>{{bug|MC-147895}}</ref>

==== Savanna village ====
Prior to [[Java Edition 1.10]], plains villages would generate in savanna [[biome]]s. Plains villages was replaced by savanna villages made out of acacia derived blocks.

==== Desert village ====
Prior to [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], plains villages would generate in desert [[biome]]s. Plains villages was replaced by desert villages made out of sandstone derived blocks.

Prior to [[Java Edition 1.8]], plains wells would generate in desert villages. Plains wells was replaced by desert wells made out of sandstone derived blocks.

=== Stronghold glass pillars ===
{{conjecture|section=1}}
{{Infobox structure

Glass pillars were a debug element of end portal rooms used to mark the location of [[stronghold]]s, since the [[eye of ender]]'s functionality of pointing toward strongholds did not exist yet. One pillar extended from the main entrance and another from the portal room, both from the Stone Bricks to the build limit. They were accidentally left in the public release of [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3]], and were removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4|the next update]].

=== Clay blobs ===
{{Main article|Clay Blob}}
Prior to [[Java Edition Beta 1.8]], clay blobs were a terrain feature that existed as a way for [[clay]] blocks to generate naturally. They were removed and clay is now found as [[Disk|disks]] instead.

=== Gravel beaches ===
{{Main article|Beach}}
Prior to Beta 1.8, beaches existed as a terrain feature and generated in two variants ([[sand]] beaches and [[gravel]] beaches). Beaches were removed in Beta 1.8, then returned as biome in [[Java Edition 1.1]] but without gravel variant.

== Map settings ==
=== Color and cloud customisation ===
In [[Indev]] versions of Minecraft, it was possible to customize the color of the sky, fog, and clouds via map editing, but this feature was removed in [[Infdev]]. Unlike some customizations now available via [[custom world generation]], these are yet to see a return.

=== Isometric screenshot ===
{{Redirect|Isometric|the Minecraft Wiki help page on isometric renders|Help:Isometric renders}}
[[File:Isometric screenshot.png|thumb|An isometric screenshot]]

In the [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] versions of ''Minecraft'', players could take a screenshot of the map from an [[wikipedia:Isometric projection|isometric perspective]] using {{Key|F7}}. When the game captured an isometric image, it would save the current location of all mobs and show any and all alterations to the map the player had made that would be visible from the perspective of the sun (at sunrise). The player would not be visible unless the player was in third-person view before taking the isometric screenshot.

The isometric screenshot would save to their local user folder as "mc_map_####.png" where #### represents the number of the screenshot starting at 0000 up to 9999.

There are some limitations that existed with the screenshots:
* They could capture the player's model only when in third-person view.
* Due to a glitch, the screenshot would render only those blocks that are in the player's FOV, and everything else is either black or shows underground sections that would have been obstructed.

This feature was removed in [[Java Edition Infdev|Infdev]] due to the addition of infinite worlds. Was replaced by [[level previewer]].

=== Indev map settings ===
{{Main|Indev map settings}}
During the development of [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]], there were settings to change level's theme, type, shape and size.

=== Level previewer ===
{{main|Level previewer}}

=== "Winter Mode" map type ===
[[File:Snowscene.png|thumb|A "Winter Mode" world.]]

"Winter Mode" was a randomly occurring map type in Alpha. It was added on July 9, 2010, in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.4|Alpha v1.0.4]] and was the first "biome" to appear in ''Minecraft''.

There were a couple of differences compared to normal worlds. First, there was the presence of snowflakes, which fell constantly. There were four different kinds of snowflakes. These snowflakes would create snow on surfaces directly exposed to the sky, provided that it was a solid block. Due to a lack of unfrozen water, [[Sugar Cane|reeds]] were rare. The second element unique to "Winter Mode" was the presence of ice. When a map was generated, most exposed water blocks would be frozen into ice. The water did not freeze completely near gravel beaches. The third element was a decrease in the spawning rate of passive mobs.

Whether a world was in "Winter Mode" was determined with a 25% chance at creation.

"Winter Mode" was removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0|Alpha v1.2.0]] with the addition of proper biomes.

<gallery>

=== "Default 1.1" world type ===
[[File:Default-1.1-map.png|thumb|A comparison of a world with the "Default" world type at the top and a world with the "Default 1.1" world type both created in 1.7-1.12.]]

The "Default 1.1" world type was added in [[Java Edition 1.2.1|1.2.1]] (snapshot [[Java Edition 12w03a|12w03a]]). Initially it was permanently applied to old worlds in order to prevent chunk borders but from snapshot [[Java Edition 12w07a|12w07a]] onwards, this world type only got used during the conversion process from the [[Region file format]] to the [[Anvil file format]] which stored biomes in chunk data. After conversion, old worlds would switch back to the default world type which allowed for world generation to create [[jungle]]s. The world type was accessible in later versions by changing the "generatorName" property in the [[Java_Edition_level_format#level.dat_format|level.dat]] of a world created in 1.2 to "default_1_1" and it would persist across world saves. When it was first added, the "Default 1.1" world type was simply the same as the default world type but without jungles. In [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]], it was changed to match the updated biome generation with the only difference being that warm climate regions were replaced with regions containing biomes from 1.1, those being [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[Windswept Hills|extreme hills]], [[swamp]]s, [[plains]] and [[taiga]]s. With another biome overhaul occuring in [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]] ([[Java_Edition_1.18_Experimental_Snapshot_1|experimental snapshot 1]]), the "Default 1.1" world type was removed.

=== Biomes prior to 1.7.2 ===
{{main|Biome}}

Versions prior to [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]] had two biomes that were later removed from the world generator. Despite being unused, they continued to exist until Java Edition 1.18, in which mountain edge got removed.

The following biomes became unused in 1.7.2:
*Mountain edge (became available in the "Buffet" world type)
*Frozen ocean (restored in 1.13 as a very different biome)

=== Biomes prior to Beta 1.8 ===
{{main|Biome/Before Beta 1.8}}

In [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], [[biome]]s received a major overhaul, removing and changing many of them. Prior to these changes, there were 13 biome types that were much smaller and less distinct.

=== Biomes prior to 1.18 ===
{{main|Biome/Before 1.18}}
In [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]], terrain height is no longer controlled by biome, so the following height variations biome have been removed and had their code merged into the main one:

=== "Customized" world type ===
{{main|Old Customized}}

"Customized" was a [[world type]] that gave control over many settings that affected terrain generation, such as ores, sea level, biomes, structures, and many variables that govern the random shape of the terrain. It was introduced in snapshot [[14w17a]] for [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]], and was removed in snapshot [[18w06a]] for [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]]. Although customized worlds were added back in the [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]] snapshot [[20w21a]], there is currently no in-game menu to modify worlds; custom worlds can be generated only by importing a JSON file.
{{-}}

=== Historical file formats ===
Several historical file formats existed before the current Anvil file format during early development of Minecraft.

* [[Region file format|McRegion]] (from [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]] to [[Java Edition 1.1|1.1]])
* [[Java Edition Alpha level format|Alpha level format]] (from [[Java Edition Infdev 20100327|Infdev 20100327]] to [[Java Edition Beta 1.2 02|Beta 1.2_02]])
* [[Zone file format]] (used exclusively in [[Infdev 20100624]])
* [[Java Edition Indev level format|Indev level format]] (from [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100122-2251|Indev 0.31 20100122-2251]] to [[Java Edition Infdev 20100325-1640|Infdev 20100325-1640]])
* [[Java Edition Classic level format|Classic level format]] (from [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-132211|pre-Classic rd-132211]] to [[Java Edition Classic 0.30|Classic 0.30]])

=== Audio loops ===
Loops were unused [[sound]]s, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the player is in a specific type of location (i.e., in caves, [[forest]]s, oceans and beside a waterfall). These sound effects only appeared in [[C418]]'s June 4, 2009 Sound Test.<ref>{{ytl|UIFkQMEz9X8}}</ref>

They were found in <code>.minecraft/resources/sound/loops/</code>, and could be converted to reveal four loops, of birds chirping, cave chimes, ocean and waterfall noises.

=== calm4.ogg ===
{{main|Magnetic Circuit}}
[[File:calm4.ogg]]

<code>calm4.ogg</code> was a [[music]] track that was included accidentally in [[Java Edition Alpha 1.1.1]] when he used it to test the music system.

== Unused ==
{{See also|Java Edition unused features}}

These features never had any functionality in-game.

=== Other ===
==== "Play Tutorial Level" button ====
An unclickable "Play Tutorial Level" button was added to the main menu during Indev. With the addition of [[texture pack]]s in [[Java Edition Alpha 1.2.2|Alpha v1.2.2]], the button was removed. No tutorial level had actually existed during that time.[[File:Fluff.png|thumb|Fluff.png.|alt=]]

=== Textures ===
{{main|History of textures#Unused textures|Java Edition history of textures/Blocks#Placeholder textures}}

==== Fluff.png ====
In Infdev, a texture called <code>Fluff.png</code> was added. It was used as a texture for clouds from [[Java Edition Infdev 20100611|Infdev 20100611]] to [[Java Edition Infdev 20100618|Infdev 20100618]], but became unused in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100624|Infdev 20100624]] and was removed by [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha v1.2.2]].

{{-}}

==== Minecart texture ====
{{See also|Minecart}}
[[File:Minecart dirt.png|thumb|The minecart dirt texture .]]
The texture from the [[minecart]] model is rarely visible. The texture appears to be dirt, which is an artifact of when the minecart used to act as a portable chest. The "dirt" level used to raise when items were put into it. The texture still appeared inside minecarts until [[Java Edition 1.18 Pre-release 2]].<ref>{{bug|MC-206303}}</ref>

==== Purple arrow ====
[[File:Purple Arrow.png|thumb|upright|right|Purple arrow]]
[[File:Purple arrow in game.jpg|thumb|The purple arrow shot by a skeleton in Survival Test.]]
{{see also|Arrow#History}}
Purple arrows were shot by [[skeleton]]s in [[Survival Test]] versions from [[Java Edition Classic 0.25 SURVIVAL TEST|0.25]]. They acted the same as regular [[arrow]]s, but could not be picked up. The purple arrow used a texture on the same sheet as the normal arrows, but the texture is not currently in use.

Despite being unused, their texture was updated with the normal arrow's in the April Fools' snapshot [[15w14a]]. With the addition of a new arrow texture in [[Java Edition 1.9]], the original arrow texture, including the purple arrows, became entirely unused. The original texture was removed in snapshot [[21w13a]].<ref name="UnusedFiles">{{bug|MC-108636}}</ref>

=== Resources ===

==== ''chunkinfo'' command ====
From [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]] (snapshot [[14w30a]]) to [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]] (snapshot [[17w45a]]), the file <code>en_us.lang</code> contained translation strings for a <code>/chunkinfo</code> [[command]], which never existed in game. The following keys existed:

<pre>
commands.chunkinfo.usage=/chunkinfo [<x> <y> <z>]
commands.chunkinfo.location=Chunk location: (%s, %s, %s)
commands.chunkinfo.noChunk=No chunk found at chunk position %s, %s, %s
commands.chunkinfo.notEmpty=Chunk is not empty.
commands.chunkinfo.empty=Chunk is empty.
commands.chunkinfo.notCompiled=Chunk is not compiled.
commands.chunkinfo.compiled=Chunk is compiled.
commands.chunkinfo.hasNoRenderableLayers=Chunk has no renderable layers.
commands.chunkinfo.hasLayers=Chunk has layers: %s
commands.chunkinfo.isEmpty=Chunk has empty layers: %s
commands.chunkinfo.vertices=%s layer's buffer contains %s vertices
commands.chunkinfo.data=First 64 vertices are: %s
</pre>

It is unknown if this command was used for development or was simply a dropped feature.

==== command_blocks.pdn ====
[[File:command_blocks.pdn|160px|thumb|command_blocks.pdn]]

<code>command_blocks.pdn</code> was an unused file added in [[15w34a]] and quickly removed in [[15w34b|the next snapshot]]. This file was created with the [[wikipedia:Paint.net|Paint.NET]] program and, presumably, was used in the creation of the textures for the impulse, chain and repeat types of [[command block]], added in the same snapshot.

The file also contains multiple layers. From 10 layers, by default, only "Back Shadow", "Back Panel", and "Orange Back" layers are visible, forming the back texture for the impulse command block. The "Background" name is given to the first created layer in an image created by Paint.NET. This layer contains the old texture for command block, which implies that all other layers were created based upon it. Compared to the final textures, the layers included in <code>command_blocks.pdn</code> lack animation frames and use different colors for the individual “lights” on each “panel”.

== Other ==

=== Numeric IDs ===
{{Main article|Java Edition pre-flattening data values}}
Prior to [[Java Edition 1.13]], all blocks and items had unique numeric IDs alongside namespaced IDs. Numeric IDs were removed during [[Java Edition Flattening|The Flattening]] in 1.13 and all blocks and items now have only namespaced IDs.

=== Spawning nether portals with {{Key|F4}} ===
In [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2a]], players had the ability to spawn [[nether portal]]s by pressing {{Key|F4}}. In [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2b|Alpha v1.2.2b]], spawning nether portals using {{key|F4}} was removed.

=== Toggle rain with {{Key|F5}} ===
In early Indev versions, pressing {{key|F5}} would toggle between rain and clear.

=== Time control with {{key|F6}} and {{key|F7}} ===
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release|Beta 1.8 Pre-release]], as a result of remaining debug code, players had the ability to use {{Key|F6}} and {{Key|F7}} to control in-game time. In [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2 ;)|Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2]], the functionality of {{key|F6}} and {{key|F7}} was removed.

=== Access crafting with {{Key|B}} ===
In [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100129-1447|Indev 20100129-1447]], it was possible to access 3x3 crafting grid by pressing {{Key|B}}. This was intended only as temporary way, and it was removed shortly after in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100129-2332|Indev 20100129-2332]] after addition of [[Crafting Table|crafting tables]].

=== Toggle render distance with {{Key|F}} ===
Between [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.12a|0.0.12a]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3|Beta 1.7.3]], pressing {{Key|F}} would toggle render distance.

=== Spawning human mobs with {{Key|G}} ===
In [[Java Edition pre-Classic|pre-Classic]] and early [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]], it was possible to spawn [[Mob (entity)|human mobs]] by pressing {{Key|G}}. As human mobs were removed from normal gameplay in [[Java Edition Survival Test|Survival Test]], this functionality was also removed as well.

=== Respawn with {{Key|R}} ===
In [[Java Edition pre-Classic|pre-Classic]], early [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] and late Classic (except for versions with Survival mode), it was possible for player to respawn on default position in world by pressing {{Key|R}}, which was especially useful if player was stuck somewhere. This was removed in [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]].

=== Entity numbers showing while on debug screen ===
Prior to [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], entity numbers shown above mobs when player opened debug screen with {{Key|F3}}. This feature was removed probably to prevent unfair progress, because it allowed players to see where caves and dungeons were located due to monsters in them being labeled by numbers.

=== "Loading..." screen ===
Between [[Java Edition Infdev 20100629|Infdev 20100629]] and [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.3|Alpha 1.0.3]], a "Loading..." screen with dirt background appeared upon starting the game. This was removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.4|Alpha 1.0.4]] and replaced with Mojang splash screen.

=== Old world selection ===
Save level, Load level and Generate new level were features in game menu between [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] and [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]]. Save level allowed player to save world which was currently opened, Load level allowed player to load previously saved worlds, while Generate new level allowed player to generate new world. This was removed in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100327|Infdev 20100327]] and replaced with Select World menu and [[Autosave]].

In [[Java Edition Classic 0.24 SURVIVAL TEST|0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST]], Save level and Load level options were disabled.

=== World slots ===
Between [[Java Edition Infdev 20100327|Infdev 20100327]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.2 02|Beta 1.2_02]], players could create only up to 5 worlds. If players wanted to create a new world, they had to delete an existing world. World slots were removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]] and players could create as many worlds as they want.

=== Block indicator ===
Block indicator was added in [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-20090515|rd-20090515]] to indicate currently selected block. It was located on upper right corner of screen. Block indicator was removed in [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.19a|0.0.19a]] and replaced with hotbar.

=== Texture pack ===
[[Texture pack]]s were added in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2|Alpha v1.2.2]], and were replaced with [[resource pack]]s in snapshot [[Java Edition 13w24a|13w24a]] for [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]].

=== "Super Secret Settings" button ===
{{Main|Super Secret Settings}}
The "Super Secret Settings", added in snapshot [[13w38a]] for [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]], were removed in snapshot [[15w31a]] for [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]] due to an internal rewrite. It was a button under the [[options]] menu that, when pressed, would blare a random game sound with a lower pitch, and activate a [[shader]].

=== "3D Anaglyph" option ===
[[File:3D Anaglyph pre-17w43a.png|300px|thumb|"3D Anaglyph" option before 1.13.]]
[[File:Notch3D.jpg|300px|thumb|3D Anaglyph image from Notch's blog.]]
[[File:3D Anaglyph.png|300px|thumb|3D Anaglyph image from Notch's website.]]
{{see also|Options}}

"3D Anaglyph" was an option (added in [[Java Edition Classic 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST]]) in video settings that applies a red-cyan stereoscopic effect, enabling the use of red-cyan 3D glasses to experience the game in more depth. This option was removed in snapshot [[Java Edition 17w43a|17w43a]] for [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]] due to 3D glasses becoming less popular.{{cn}}

{{-}}

=== "Limit Framerate" option ===
"Limit Framerate" was an option (added in [[Java Edition Classic 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST|0.26 SURVIVAL TEST]]) in video settings that allowed player to toggle framerate of game. Prior to [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.5|Beta 1.6.5]], it had only OFF and ON states. In Beta 1.6.5, this option was renamed to "Framerate cap" and instead of single OFF/ON switch, states 200, 90 and 40 FPS were added. It was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6|Beta 1.6.6]] and replaced with "Performance" option.

=== "Performance" option ===
"Performance" was an option (added in [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]]) in video settings that allowed player to configure framerate of game. It had three states, Balanced (limits to 120 maximum FPS), Power Saver (constantly limits to 35 FPS) and Max FPS (sets no limit to maximum FPS). It was removed in [[Java Edition 1.7.2]] and replaced with Max Framerate slider.

=== "Maximum" and "Minimum" Smooth lighting ===
"Maximum" and "Minimum" (added in [[Java Edition 1.5]]) were states of the Smooth lighting option. "Minimum" state used the original smooth lighting rendering that existed since [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]], while "Maximum" state existed as way to correct lighting of certain blocks (like back of [[stairs]]). Over time, there wasn't any difference between these states and in [[Java Edition 1.19.3 Release Candidate 1|Java Edition 1.19.3 RC1]], the "Minimum" state of smooth lighting was removed and the "Maximum" state was renamed to ON.

=== "Advanced OpenGL" option ===
"Advanced OpenGL" was an option (added in [[Java Edition Beta 1.5]]) in video settings that allowed players to use occlusion culling which means it didn't rendered blocks that the player can't "see" which helped performance in cards that support it, but many players complained that it was counterproductive. This option was removed in [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]].

=== "Use VBOs" option ===
"Use VBOs" was an option (added in [[Java Edition 14w29a]]) in video settings that allowed players to toggle [[w:Vertex_buffer_object|VBOs]] which offered a ~10% performance increase when set to ON. It was removed in [[Java Edition 18w44a]] and VBOs are now always used.

=== "Show FPS" option ===
"Show FPS" was an option (added in [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.23a]]) that allowed players to show debug screen. It was removed in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.1|Alpha 1.1.1]] and debug screen is now opened with {{Key|F3}} key.

=== "Alternate Blocks" option ===
"Alternate Blocks" was an option (added in [[Java Edition 14w28a]]) that allowed players to enable (or disable) weighted alternative block models. When turned off, the least complex highest priority model is always used for each block. It was removed in [[Java Edition 1.9]].

=== "Server Textures" option ===
"Server Textures" was a client-side option (added in [[Java Edition 1.3.1]]) in video settings that allowed players to enable (or disable) texture pack/resource pack used by server. It was removed in [[Java Edition 1.7.6]] and replaced with server-side "Server Resource Packs" option and moved from video settings to Edit Server Info.

=== "Hide Address" option ===
"Hide Address" was an option in Edit Server Info that allowed players to toggle display of IP addresses in server list. It was removed in [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], probably for privacy reasons.

=== "Player Activity" button ===
The "Player Activity" button in "[[Minecraft Realms]]" was added in [[Java Edition 1.5|1.5]], but it was removed in [[Java Edition 1.14.4|1.14.4]] for unknown reasons. This button was used to show the online activities of players.

=== Chat preview ===
Chat preview was a feature (added in [[Java Edition 1.19]]) which displayed a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box, showing how messages appeared when sent. Chat preview sent chat messages to the server as they were typed, even before they were sent, the server then sent back the styled preview in real time. This allowed servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed. Chat preview was removed in [[Java Edition 1.19.3]].

=== Native Twitch.tv integration ===
Native [[wikipedia:Twitch (service)|Twitch.tv]] integration was added in snapshot [[13w47a]] for [[Java Edition 1.7.4|1.7.4]], and was removed in snapshot [[15w31a]] for [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]]. It integrated Twitch chat into the game.

=== Java launcher easter eggs ===
Prior to the release of [[Launcher 2.1.497x]], the launcher contained multiple easter eggs. If the player hovered their cursor over the "Play" button for a few seconds, a random mob would appear in the bottom right corner of the launcher. In the top left corner of the launcher, the player could see a translucent [[creeper]] face. There was about a <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>11</sub> chance of the creeper face being replaced with a shrugging [[wikipedia:Emoticon#Japanese style|kaomoji]], ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. When the player clicked on either of these, they turned solid white. Clicking them again would return them to their translucent state. In addition, if the player pressed {{Key|Ctrl}}+{{Key|B}}, the [[experience orb]] pickup sound would play ({{sound||Succesfull Hit.ogg}}).

=== Old conduit particle ===

The [[conduit]] was added in snapshot [[18w15a]] with [[particles]], but those particles were changed in the next snapshot, [[18w16a]].

{{-}}

=== Void fog and particles ===
{{main|Void|Fog}}

From [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release]] up to its removal in [[Java Edition 14w34c]], a fog effect and particles would appear in the lower 16 blocks of the world.

{{-}}

=== Dispensing command blocks ===
From snapshot [[14w07a]] for [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]], [[dispenser]]s had the ability to place [[command block]]s, when activated. This feature was removed as of [[Java Edition 1.8.6|1.8.6]] to solve a security issue.<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|603200679532978176|For the security fix in 1.8.6 it was necessary to remove a feature (permanently) that was used by map makers.

We usually don't break compatibility and this will be an exception to the rule, hopefully the only one.] – [https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=searge Searge], May 26, 2015</ref>

=== Mobs running from creepers ===
In [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]], mobs ran away from [[creeper]]s that were about to explode. In [[Java Edition 1.8.1-pre1|1.8.1-pre1]], this feature was removed because every mob that had the ability to run from a creeper was looking for an exploding creeper every [[tick]], degrading performance.

=== Ravagers in illager patrols ===
In snapshot [[Java Edition 18w45a|18w45a]] for [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]], [[Ravager|ravagers]] were originally meant to spawn in [[Patrol|illager patrols]] rather than [[Raid|raids]]. In [[Java Edition 18w46a|18w46a]], ravagers were removed from illager patrols which made them briefly unused, and in [[Java Edition 18w47a|18w47a]], ravagers were now spawning in raids instead.

=== Ravagers fleeing away from rabbits ===
In snapshot [[Java Edition 18w43a|18w43a]] for 1.14, ravagers were fleeing away in presence of rabbits. This feature was removed in [[Java Edition 18w44a|18w44a]] because it didn't fit with ravager's lore.<ref>[https://x.com/jeb_/status/1057291072286658560 "FYI, I asked Josh to remove this feature again. Although funny, being scared of rabbits doesn't fit with the Beast's lore."] – [https://x.com/jeb_ @jeb_] (Jens Bergensten) on X (formerly Twitter), October 30, 2018</ref>

=== Water evaporating on magma blocks ===
In snapshot [[16w20a]] for [[Java Edition 1.10|1.10]], water evaporated on top of [[magma block]]s when randomly ticked. From snapshot [[18w07a]] for [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], whirlpool [[bubble column]]s are produced on top of magma blocks instead.

=== Hitting doors opens/closes them ===
Prior to [[Java Edition 1.4.2]], it was possible to open and close [[Wooden Door|wooden doors]] by hitting them with left click. This feature was removed, probably because destroying doors was more difficult.

=== Hitting primed TNT defuses it ===
In [[Java Edition Classic 0.30]], it was possible to defuse primed [[TNT]] by hitting it with left click. This feature was removed in [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]].

=== Sheep drop wool upon being hit ===
Between [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6|Beta 1.6.6]], hitting [[sheep]] with left click made them drop [[wool]]. This feature was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.7|Beta 1.7]] due to addition of [[shears]].

=== Boats shatter on impact ===
Prior to [[Java Edition 1.9]], crashing [[Boat|boats]] instantly broke them into [[planks]] and [[Stick|sticks]]. In 1.9, this behavior was removed as many players complained about it.

=== Tilling grass ===
Prior to [[Java Edition Beta 1.6]], tilling a [[Grass Block|grass block]] with a [[hoe]] had a small chance of dropping [[Wheat Seeds|wheat seeds]]. This feature was removed and wheat seeds are now obtained by breaking a [[Short Grass|short grass]] instead.

=== Walking tramples farmland ===
Prior to [[Java Edition 1.1]], players (and other mobs as well) could trample [[farmland]] by walking on it. To avoid this, players had to use [[sneaking]]. This feature was removed and farmland is now trampled only when player jumps onto it.

=== Old fire spreading behavior ===
Prior to [[Java Edition Beta 1.6]], fire spreading was very aggressive and fire was able to spread infinitely. This behavior was removed in Beta 1.6 and fire spreading was severely nerfed.

=== Breaking blocks with swords in Creative mode ===
Between [[Java Edition Beta 1.8]] and [[Java Edition 1.5.2|1.5.2]], it was possible to break blocks with [[Sword|swords]] in Creative mode. This ability was removed in [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]], probably to prevent players from accidentally destroying their buildings while fighting mobs.

=== Monsters attacking players in Creative mode ===
Between [[Java Edition Beta 1.8]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4|Beta 1.9 Pre-release 4]], monsters were trying to attack players in Creative mode. This behavior was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5|Beta 1.9 Pre-release 5]] and all monsters remained neutral towards Creative mode players, unless player provoked them by hitting (until versions 1.6.1 and 1.7.2 where provocation was gradually removed).

=== Old block interactions ===
In [[Java Edition pre-Classic|pre-Classic]] and early [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] versions, block interactions behaved differently.

* Prior to [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.11a|0.0.11a]], blocks were placed by left click and destroyed by right click. After 0.0.11a, this behavior was changed and players would toggle block placing/destroying by right click and use configured interaction with left click. Survival Test reverted this behavior to that before 0.0.11a with only difference that left click and right click are doing opposite, like today.
* Block outline appeared as white glowing square (instead of black outline box). Prior to 0.0.11a, it appeared only on side of block at which player was pointing (rather than around entire block). After 0.0.11a, block outline appeared around entire block, and before placing block a transparent preview cube appeared as visual indication of block placement. This outline behavior was removed in Survival Test and replaced with black outline box, that is used until today.
* In [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-132211|rd-132211]] and [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-132328|rd-132328]], it was not possible to select blocks. Grass had pre-defined placement on surface layer (Y=0), while cobblestone placement was possible anywhere below or higher.

=== Arbitrary placement of plants ===
Between [[Java Edition pre-Classic|pre-Classic]] and early [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]], it was possible to place plants ([[Sapling|saplings]], [[Mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[Flower|flowers]]) on any blocks, even on top of another plant, and not only on [[Grass Block|grass blocks]] or [[dirt]]. Last version where this was possible is [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100202|Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100202-2330]] (the exact removal date is uncertain because Indev versions between 20100202-2330 and 20100206-2103 are not archived).

=== Removed after Survival Test ===

==== Placeholder block drops ====
{{main|Survival Test}}

[[Survival Test]] introduced block [[drops]], which were mapped as follows:

{| class="wikitable sortable" data-description="Block drops in Survival Test"
|-
! scope="col" |[[Block]]
! scope="col" |Historical [[drops]]
! scope="col" |Current drops
|-

|{{LegacyBlockSprite|oak-log-je2-be1}} [[Log|Wood]]
|{{LegacyBlockSprite|oak-planks-je3-be1}} [[Planks]]
|{{BlockSprite|Oak Log|Wood}} (itself)
|}

Block drops were reworked in [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]].

==== Minimized textures ====
{{main|Survival Test}}

In [[Survival Test]], item [[drops]] were restricted to the cube shape used for blocks. The projected texture was the same on all faces and the texture scale was closer to those of blocks, making it look cropped.

==== Old walking animation for mobs ====
In [[Survival Test]], mobs ([[pig]]s, [[sheep]], [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[spider]]s and [[creeper]]s) had different walking animations.

==== Creeper melee attack ====
In [[Survival Test]], [[creeper]]s did melee damage ({{health|4}}) to the player. In [[Java Edition Indev 0.31|Indev 0.31]], this feature was removed.

=== Accidentally removed ===

==== Removed with the 1.3 server split ====
{{main|Java Edition 12w18a/List of broken features}}
When 1.3 split client and server logic, several features lost significant functionality. While some of these have been effectively restored or at least substituted, many of them remain removed to this day.

==== Expanding ghasts ====
[[Ghast]]s used to expand slightly before shooting fireballs. This was accidentally removed in 1.3.<ref>{{bug|MC-165038}}</ref>

==== Villagers accepting flowers from iron golems ====
Baby villagers used to accept poppies (originally roses) offered to them by iron golems since their addition in [[Java Edition 12w08a]]. This feature was removed at some point during the development of [[Java Edition 1.14]]. Iron golems still offer poppies to baby villagers, but they don't take the flower from the golem's hand.<ref>{{bug|MC-159069}}</ref>

==== Erosion basins ====
[[Erosion]]s, also known as basins, are terrain features that strip away the surface layer of blocks in a small area, exposing the stone underneath. They were accidentally removed in 1.18 ([[Java Edition 21w41a]]).<ref>{{bug|MC-264579}}</ref>

==== Underground mushrooms ====
Mushrooms generated in caves from [[Java Edition Classic 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST]] until 1.18 ([[Java Edition 21w39a]]), when underground mushroom patches were (probably accidentally) removed from Java Edition, and have yet to be re-added.<ref>{{bug|MC-244162}}.</ref>

=== Ability to milk squids ===
Between [[Java Edition Beta 1.2]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.2 02|Beta 1.2_02]], it was possible to milk [[Squid|squids]] with an empty [[bucket]]. This feature was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]].

=== Jumping increases experience ===
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease|Java Edition Beta 1.9 Pre-release]], it was possible to gain experience points by jumping. This was only a testing feature and was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2|Java Edition Beta 1.9 Pre-release 2]].

=== entity.hanging.place and entity.hanging.pop ===
<code>entity.hanging.place</code> and <code>entity.hanging.pop</code> were two sound effects added in snapshot [[15w49a]] and removed in the next snapshot, [[15w49b]]. The sound effects were blank audio files and were likely intended as sound effects for the [[lead]].

=== /locate New_Village ===
{{main|Commands}}

There was a locate command called {{cmd|locate New_Village}}. This was implemented in snapshot [[18w48a]] for [[Java Edition 1.14|Village & Pillage]] before the [[village]] structures from [[Update Aquatic]] and prior were removed. Once these "old" villages were officially taken from the game's structure spawn list in snapshot [[19w02a]], {{cmd|locate New_Village}} was replaced by {{cmd|locate Village}} as the {{cd|New_Village}} ID was no longer needed.

=== Tags ===
{{main|Tag#History}}

The <code>water_hacked</code> and <code>waterlogged</code> tags were added in snapshots [[Java Edition 18w07a|18w07a]] and [[Java Edition 18w07b|18w07b]] for [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]] respectively and removed in [[Java Edition 18w10c|18w10c]]. Before the removal, these tags functioned as follows:

{|class="wikitable sortable" data-description="Removed tags"
!scope="col"|[[Tag]]
!scope="col" class="unsortable"|Values
!scope="col" class="unsortable"|Usage
|-
|minecraft:water_hacked
|#minecraft:stairs, #minecraft:waterlogged, #minecraft:slabs, minecraft:chest
|Blocks in this tag render in water as if any non-filled space in the block [[model]] was water.
|-
|minecraft:waterlogged
|#minecraft:coral_plants, minecraft:bubble_column, minecraft:kelp, minecraft:kelp_top, minecraft:sea_grass, minecraft:tall_sea_grass
|Used in the <code>water_hacked.json</code> block tag file. Prevents non-water mobs from spawning in this block. Allows swimming in this block.
