'''Raw cod''' is a [[food]] item that can be eaten by the player or cooked to make [[cooked cod]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
[[Cod]] always drops 1 raw cod when killed, unaffected by Looting.<ref>{{bug|MC-212795||Salmon & Fish mobs are not affected by Looting}}</ref> If it is killed while on [[fire]], it drops 1 [[cooked cod]] instead.

{{Drop sources|Raw Cod}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{el|java}}{{LootChestItem|raw-cod}}

=== Fishing ===
{{main|Fishing}}
Raw cod can be obtained from fishing, with a 51% chance per attempt.

=== Villager gifts ===
{{IN|java}}, fisherman [[villager]]s throw raw cod at [[player]]s under the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.

== Usage ==

=== Smelting ingredient ===
{{smelting
 |Raw Cod
 |Cooked Cod
 |0.35
}}

=== Food ===
Raw cod restores {{hunger|2}} [[hunger]] and 0.4 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Cats ===
Raw cod can be used to tame [[cat]]s with {{frac|1|3}} chance of success, get cats off of [[chest]]s and [[bed]]s, [[breed]] cats, and make baby cats grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time. Additionally, raw cod can be used to heal cats by {{hp|2|mob=1}}.

=== Ocelots ===
Raw cod can be used to gain [[ocelot]] trust, breed ocelots, and make baby ocelots grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

=== Dolphins ===
[[Dolphin]]s can be fed raw cod. Doing this improves their trust and interaction with the player. However, unlike most animals, feeding dolphins does not allow them to breed. Additionally, raw cod can be used to make baby dolphins grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

Dolphins swim to the nearest chest in a [[shipwreck]] or [[underwater ruin]] after they are fed raw cod. If the chest in the nearest structure is broken, they swim to another structure with a chest.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Wolves ===
Raw cod can be used to feed [[wolves]], healing them by {{hp|4|mob=1}}. However, {{in|Bedrock}}, unlike other wolf food, raw cod cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves nor used to breed them and can only be fed to a wolf that is not at full health.
