'''Mud''' is a block found abundantly in [[mangrove swamp]]s or created by using a [[water bottle]] on any type of [[dirt]] block. It can be used for [[crafting]] or converted into [[clay]] using [[pointed dripstone]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Mud can be broken by hand and by any [[tool]], but using a [[shovel]] speeds up the process.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Mud|link=none|Shovel}}

=== Natural generation ===
Mud generates in the [[mangrove swamp]] biome. Mud can also generate in [[trail ruins]] and in some entrance rooms of [[trial chambers]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a mud block drops the block upon death.

=== Post-generation ===
{{control|Using}} a [[water bottle]] on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], or [[rooted dirt]] transforms it into mud. This process can be automated using a [[dispenser]].

To turn dirt into mud, the water bottle cannot be used on the bottom face of the block.<ref>{{bug|MC-253472||Dirt, rooted & coarse cannot be saturated (turned into mud) on the bottom face}}</ref> However, a dispenser can still be used even if it is used on the bottom face.

== Usage ==
{{See also|Solid block#Height}}
Mud is not a full block, and as such, it has some unique properties; [[entities]] standing on mud sink slightly into it, similar to [[soul sand]]. Unlike soul sand, however, mud does not slow the movement speed of mobs or players that walk on it. Falling blocks such as [[sand]] also drop as an item when landing on it, and a [[hopper]] that is under a mud block can collect items dropped on top of it.

Items on top of mud move alongside it when it is pushed by a [[piston]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Clay ===
If mud is placed directly above a block that has [[pointed dripstone]] underneath, it eventually turns into [[clay]]. This conversion does not happen in [[the Nether]].<ref>{{bug|MC-264720||Mud does not convert to clay in Nether with dripstone|WAI}}</ref>

=== Dirt ===
Growing an [[azalea tree]] converts mud and muddy mangrove roots into [[rooted dirt]], which can be [[hoe]]d into [[dirt]].
