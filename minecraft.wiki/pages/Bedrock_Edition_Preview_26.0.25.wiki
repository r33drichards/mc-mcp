'''[[Party|Party system]]'''{{note|This ''Preview'' has it only implemented in some devices, implemented in all devices in later ''Previews''.}}
* Players can now create and join "parties", which are groups of people found in the [[Social|social drawer]] where all members automatically join any world the leader is in.
* Members don't need to be in the leader's world and can still be in the menus or a different world while in a party.
* Parties can contain up to 15 members.
** The leader can choose what type of privacy setting the party has: "Invited only" requires the leader to send an invite to in-game friends to join, or "Open" makes the party accessible for any friends.
* The leader can promote other members to leader.
* A new settings tab allows the player to change which invites are shown, whether members can also send invites, and the default party privacy setting.
