'''Beta 1.7_01''' is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]], released on June 30, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|notch|86442916926603265|Put up 1.7_01, fixing the right clicking on sheep, and the piston crash, and makes crashed worlds loadable again. Client and server.|June 30, 2011}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in [[Beta 1.7]]. This version is not available through the [[launcher]], but it has been archived elsewhere and is available for download.

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed [[piston]] bug.
** Blocks that used to make the game crash in Beta 1.7 now just get removed by the piston. Crashed worlds are now able to load again.
* Fixed right-clicking on a [[sheep]] empty-handed causing game to crash.

== Trivia ==
* This version's patch number is inconsistent with the other Beta 1.7 updates. The patch number for this version is "_01", while the others are ".n", with n being the patch number. Version "Beta 1.7.1" does not exist.
** This is not the only Beta patch version that does this, with the example of [[Beta 1.0.2]].
** This is also the last version {{in|java}} to use underscores in the [[version number]].
