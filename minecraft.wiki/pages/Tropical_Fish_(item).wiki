'''Tropical fish''' is a [[food]] item that cannot be cooked.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
{{Drop sources|Tropical Fish}}

=== Fishing ===
{{Main|Fishing}}
Tropical fish can be obtained through fishing, with a 1.7% chance per attempt. See [[fishing]] for more details.

Tropical fish cannot be caught when fishing in [[jungle]] biome and variants.{{only|bedrock}}

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
Tropical fish restores {{hunger|1}} [[hunger]] and 0.2 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Dolphins ===
A [[dolphin]] can be fed tropical fish to increase its trust of the player and cause it to interact with the player more often. However, unlike most other animal mobs, this does not cause them to breed. Additionally, tropical fish can be used to make baby dolphins grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

Dolphins swim to the nearest chest in a [[shipwreck]] or [[underwater ruin]] after they are fed tropical fish. If the chest in the nearest structure is broken, they swim to another structure with a chest.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Wolves ===
Tropical fish can be used to feed [[wolves]], healing them by {{hp|2|mob=1}}. However, {{in|Bedrock}}, unlike other wolf food, tropical fish cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves nor used to breed them and can only be fed to a wolf that is not at full health.
