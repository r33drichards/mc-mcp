'''18w45a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on November 7, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w45a|November 7, 2018}}</ref>, which adds [[scaffolding]] and [[illager patrol]]s.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Standing Scaffolding JE1.png|32px]] [[Scaffolding]]'''
* A new climbable block that can be crafted using [[bamboo]] and [[string]].
* The player can climb up a block by {{control|jumping}} and go down by pressing {{control|sneak}}.
** The player can sneak by pressing {{control|sneak}} when there's no other scaffolding block below.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Illager patrol]]s'''
* Spawn in the world as a pack of 5 [[mob]]s consisting of an [[illager beast]] and 4 [[pillager]]s or [[vindicator]]s.
* Spawn in all variations of the [[plains]], [[taiga]], [[desert]] and [[savanna]] biomes, on top of [[Grass Block|grass]] or [[sand]] blocks.
* A new [[banner]] can be found on the patrol leader's head.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* Added "Programmer Art – The classic look of Minecraft" to the resource pack menu.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|loot}}'''
* General syntax: {{cmd|loot <target> <nowiki><source></nowiki>}}.
* Sources:
** <code>fish <loot table id> <fishing location> [tool <item>{{!}}mainhand{{!}}offhand]</code>
*** Uses fishing context.
** <code>loot <loot table id></code>
*** Uses loot chest context (can be also used for advancement awards and cat gifts).
** <code>kill <entity selector></code>
*** Simulates entity drops.
** <code>mine <mining location> [tool <item>{{!}}mainhand{{!}}offhand]</code>
*** Simulates block drops.
* Targets:
** <code>spawn <position></code>
*** Drops in world.
** <code>replace</code>
*** Works similar to {{cmd|replaceitem}}. If <code>count</code> is missing, command tries to place all returned items. If <code>count</code> is higher than number of items, remaining slots are cleared.
** <code>entity <entity selector> <start slot> [<count>]</code>
*** Replaces a range of slots.
** <code>block <position> <start slot> [<count>]</code>
*** Replaces range of slots.
** <code>give <player selector></code>
*** Inserts items into player's inventory (similar to {{cmd|give}}).
** <code>insert <position></code>
*** Inserts items into container (similar to {{key|shift}}+left-click).

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Rewrote the sign editing to be more intuitive.
* New movable cursor for free text editing.
* Selection support.
* Copy and paste.

'''[[Ladder]]s and [[Vine]]s'''
* Can now also be climbed using the jump key.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|drop}}'''
* Renamed to {{cmd|loot}} and reworked the syntax to be easier to understand.

'''[[Advancement]] predicates'''
* Entity predicate now accepts <code>equipment</code> field.
** This predicate can contain up to six fields: {{code|head|chest|legs|feet|mainhand|offhand|delimiter=,}}.
** If this predicate is non-null, test fails for entities that have no equipment (i.e. not mobs, players or armor stands).
