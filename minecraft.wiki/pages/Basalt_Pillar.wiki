'''Basalt pillars''' are tall [[feature]]s made up of [[basalt]] blocks.

== Generation ==
{{Incomplete section|Technical generation details}}
Basalt Pillars are '''vertical basalt formations''' that generate in the [[Soul Sand Valley]] biome. They are registered as a '''Placed Feature''' with a '''spawn rate of 10 per chunk''', ensuring they appear frequently. Their '''height and distribution''' are randomized based on placement rules, contributing to the biome's rugged aesthetic.

== Construction ==
Basalt pillars have their starting points in the ceiling of an area, then have a pillar of between one and three blocks wide in both the X and Z axis going all the way down to the ground, where a flat clump of basalt can be found around a 3×3 area from the center of the pillar, as if a vertical [[lava]] flow, like those commonly found in the Nether, had solidified.
