This guide is a simplified overview of '''all non-experimental changes''' in the Bundles of Bravery drop ({{JE}} 1.21.2 and 1.21.3), which assumes at least some familiarity with the [[Tricky Trials]] update (''Java Edition'' 1.21 and 1.21.1), excluding experimental features in these versions.

* Store up to a stack's worth of mixed item types within itself in a single inventory slot.
** The space taken up by an item depends on its stack size. For example, an item that stacks to 16 (like [[snowball]]s) takes up four times as much space as an item that stacks to 64 (like [[stick]]s).
** Items that do not stack (like [[sword]]s) occupy the entire bundle.
* Can be dyed in 16 different colors.

== Non-mob entities ==
=== Changed ===
{| {{Simple Guide table|Changed Non-mob entities}}
|-
| [[Minecart with TNT]]
| [[File:Minecart with TNT.png|84px]]
|
* Added the <code>explosion_power</code> field, controlling how powerful the explosion is.
** Defaults to 4.
** Field value is added to speed-based explosion power.
|-
| Primed [[TNT]]
| [[File:TNT.png|84px]]
|
* Added the <code>explosion_power</code> field, controlling how powerful the explosion is.

|-
| [[Arrow]] and [[trident]]
| [[File:Arrow_JE2_BE1.png|84px]] <br> [[File:Trident.png|84px]]
| Now bounce on the [[world border]] if hit.
|-
| Thrown [[ender pearl]]
| [[File:Ender_Pearl_JE3_BE2.png|84px|center]]
|
* Now loads and ticks chunks around it in a 3x3 chunk area.
** Ender pearls now ensure that the chunk they are in or travel into is always loaded and ticking.
** An ender pearl creates a ticket for chunk loading any time it moves into a new chunk, and also periodically every 10 seconds.
** They also load chunks when crossing to a new dimension, so that they can always continue to travel.
** This ensures that ender pearls can always land, and makes cross dimensional ender pearl traveling more predictable.
** Ender pearls now unload when a player logs out, and reappear whenever that player logs back in, similar to how mounts behaved previously.

* Raiders must find a place to spawn no more than 96 blocks vertically above or below the village center, or a raid cannot start.
* It is now much less likely for raiders to not find a valid place to spawn when raiding.
