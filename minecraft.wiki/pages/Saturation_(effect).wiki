'''Saturation''' is a [[status effect]] that restores [[hunger]] and [[saturation]].

== Effect ==
The Saturation effect instantly replenishes {{hunger|1}} × level and 2 × level points of saturation{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-52353||Saturation status effect does not restore saturation points}}</ref>.

If the effect lasts longer than one tick, the player continues gaining 1 hunger point and 2 saturation points on each tick, with 20 ticks (1 second) completely replenishing the player's hunger bar and saturation. Negative levels decrease [[hunger]] and saturation.

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Saturation.
*All [[mob]]s are unaffected by Saturation as they do not have hunger.

== Notes ==

* All foods replenish food saturation, but none actually add the Saturation status effect, with the exception of [[suspicious stew]] crafted with a [[dandelion]] or [[blue orchid]].
* Unlike other effects, when given to the player with the {{cmd|effect}} command, it lasts for a set amount of ticks, instead of seconds.
