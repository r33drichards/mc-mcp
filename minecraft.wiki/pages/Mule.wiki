A '''mule''' is a [[passive mob]] created by [[breeding]] a [[horse]] and a [[donkey]] together. It is very similar to a donkey, except it cannot breed.

== Spawning ==
Mules do not spawn naturally, but a mule can spawn through cross-breeding a [[horse]] with a [[donkey]]. Mules cannot breed with other mules.

20% of mule [[spawn egg]]s produce baby mules.

== Appearance ==
Mules are the offspring of horses and donkeys and are closer to (but not quite) the size of a horse. Their ears, coats, and manes are like those of a donkey, though mules' coats are darker and reddish-brown. Like donkeys, mules cannot be equipped with armor but can be equipped with chests. Mules cannot have babies, much like mules in real life.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Leather|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* {{xp|1|3}}, when killed by a player or [[tamed wolf]]. 
* If equipped with a [[chest]] or [[saddle]], they drop those items, as well as any contents of the chest.

Killing a baby mule yields no items nor experience.

== Behavior ==
Similar to horses and donkeys, mules roam idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike [[sheep]], the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. Mules turn to look at any player that comes near. Any mule, even a wild one, may be attached to a [[lead]]. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed mule, it rears and flails its front hooves.

Mules can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Mules also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}). If an entity is riding a mule, they receive the same fall damage as the mule.

Mules, like most mobs, can ride in a [[minecart]]. Similarly to horses and donkeys, adult mules cannot ride a boat, but babies can. Also like horses and donkeys, mules have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}.

=== Taming ===
Adult mules can be [[tamed]]: with an empty hand, mount the mule repeatedly; when it no longer bucks the player and shows hearts, it is tamed. It is necessary to tame a mule in order to give it equipment or ride it for any length of time. 

Taming depends on the mule's "temper". Mules begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the mule, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The mule becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the mule.

While riding an untamed mule, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid to give a general idea of the mule's speed.

Like all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.{{only|be}}

=== Breeding ===
Like their real-life counterparts, mules in ''Minecraft'' cannot produce offspring. The only way to produce a mule (other than using a spawn egg) is to cross-breed a horse with a donkey.

=== Food ===
Feeding a mule food can alter its behavior, cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; baby mules normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and/or restore its health. The table below lists the effects of the various foods mules eat.

To feed a mule, hold a valid food item and press {{control|use}} on the mule. If the food is invalid, the player simply mounts the mule. Mules can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult untamed mule to form a [[jockey]].

== Statistics ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Horses}}

Mules have three "equine stats" that vary from mule to mule: health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. These stats are created once the mule is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.

=== Spawned values ===
When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands or using spawn eggs – mules are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.

==== Health ====
A mule's health ranges from 15–30, but tends toward the average of 22–23. Displayed hearts are health, divided by two, rounded down. A mule with a non-even number of health points (15, 17, 19, etc.) does not show the last half-heart. So if a mule has 15 health ({{healthbar|15|9px|mob=1}}), its health bar will only display 14 health ({{healthbar|14|9px|mob=1}}). And if the mule took {{hp|3|mob=1}} damage, it would have 12 health left {{healthbar|12|9px|total=14|mob=1}}, but it would seem like it only took {{hp|2|mob=1}}, since the bar only shows 2 points of damage.

==== Movement speed ====
Spawned mules' speed is always 0.175; the player's normal walking speed is 0.1. The speed listed does not include any [[status effect]] that affects the speed of a horse or a player. Bred mules have speed between 0.1125 and 0.3375 based on their parent's speeds, like all other horse breeding. See [[Horse#Movement speed]].

See ''[[Transportation#Methods|transportation]]'' to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.

==== Jump strength ====
Spawned mules' jump strength is usually 0.5, which is enough to clear {{frac|1|9|16}} blocks. Jump strengths between 0.4 and 1.0 can be found in bred mules, depending on the statistics of the parents (as explained later).

=== Bred values ===
When breeding a horse and a donkey, the baby's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined as [[Horse#statistics|horses' stats]] are.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Transportation}}

Tamed and [[saddle]]d mules can be used as a means of [[transportation]] in the game. Mules float on water when being controlled by a player.

Mules can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals. They can be pulled along and tied up using a [[lead]].

=== Equipment ===
[[File:Mule GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|GUI of a mule.]]

Tamed mules have the following [[slot]]s available:

* {{SlotSprite|Saddle}} Saddle slot: for equipping a [[saddle]].
* {{InvSprite|Chest}} An additional 15 inventory slots, ''provided'' the mule has been equipped with a [[chest]].

A saddle can be equipped on a mule by holding it and then {{control|using}} on the mule, or by accessing its inventory. A mule's inventory can be accessed by mounting the mule and using {{control|inventory}} control, or by {{control|sneaking}} and then {{control|using}} or pressing the "open inventory" button {{only|bedrock}} on the mule. The saddle can be removed by either removing it from the mule's inventory or by using [[shear]]s on the mule.

A mule starts out with just a saddle slot, but if it is given a chest, it acquires 15 more inventory slots that can hold any items. Chests can be given to a mule by {{control|using}} it with the chest in hand, and the chest cannot be removed except by killing the mule. Upon death, the mule drops the attached chest and its contents.

Baby mules cannot be equipped with anything.

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}

Once a mule is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, {{control|jump}}, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control. 

A ridden saddled mule automatically runs up any one block high slope. The mule and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The mule itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. Mules cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

The maximum speed of mules, when created by breeding a horse and a donkey, varies between 4.74&nbsp;blocks/second and 14.23&nbsp;blocks/second (compared to the player's walking speed, which is about 4.3 blocks/second). About 68% of mules are able to go faster than a [[minecart]]. Any mule spawned with its spawn egg always has a speed of 7.38&nbsp;blocks/second, which is slower than a minecart at full speed. Mules are slow-moving backward, and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.

Ridden saddled mules have the ability of "jumping charging". When the player rides them, the experience bar on HUD is replaced by jumping charging bar. A ridden saddled mule can be made to jump and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Mules are not affected by jump boost beacons or potions.

== Trivia ==
* A "mule" specifically refers to the offspring of a male donkey (jack) and a female horse (mare). The offspring of a female donkey (jenny) and a male horse (stallion) is called a "hinny". However, because mules are much more common than hinnies, "mule" can colloquially refer to any donkey-horse hybrid.
* Mules are the only hybrid mobs in Minecraft.
