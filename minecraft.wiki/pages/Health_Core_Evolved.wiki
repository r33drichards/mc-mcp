'''''Health Core Evolved''''', also known as '''''Healthcore Evolved''''', is a game created by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Bundle Games Against Ebola]] game jam.

== Gameplay ==

The player is located in a room representing a {{W|Cell (biology)|cell}}. On the top right of the screen, there is a meter that shows the health points of the cell as a number. At the beginning of the game, the cell has 1600 health. There are platforms allowing the player to move to different areas. In the center of the cell lies the {{W|Cell nucleus|nucleus}}.

{{W|Bacteria}} drones spawn around the cell, with their AI being either "parasite" or "chasing". "Parasite" drones will try to attack the nucleus, while "chasing" drones will follow the player. If a drone touches the nucleus, the cell's health decreases. Drones touching the player has no effect.

The player can vaccuum drones by aiming their weapon towards them while they are close. This allows them to be shooted out. When a drone gets shot, it is destroyed and the bullet disappears.

There's no win or lose condition in the game. Cell health can be reduced to 0 with no effect, and the drones will continue to spawn no matter what the player does.

== Trivia ==

* While the theme for the game jam was "healing", the additional theme for this game was "evolution".
* The game's concept art shows that there were many ideas that were not implemented, including DNA, turrets shooting out white blood cells, viruses and membranes.
* <code>README.txt</code> mentions a future version, in which unique textures for the nucleus, platforms and the background would be included. This version is not confirmed to have ever been released.
* The source package contains various images and animations in GraphicsGale format, indicating the [https://graphicsgale.com GraphicsGale] image editor was used while creating the artwork.
* The name in the <code>README.txt</code> file is ''Health Core Evolved'' and the ZIP file name is <code>HealthCoreEvolved.zip</code>, however Humble Bundle called the game ''Healthcore Evolved''. It isn't known which name is correct, or if both are.
