**All of the following tools actually function as tools despite being unobtainable by normal means.

=== Entities ===
* [[File:White Sheep BE1.png|32px]] [[Sheep]]
** Baby sheep also exist, but do not spawn naturally.
* [[File:Pig JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Pig]]s{{verify|externally editing pigs into a 0.2.0 world doesn't appear to be possible}}
** Do not spawn naturally.
* [[File:Zombie JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Zombie]]s
** Only spawn at night.
*[[File:Camera BE2.png|32px]] [[Camera]]
** Only obtainable with external editing.
*** As the camera entity itself cannot be directly edited into the world since it does not save to entities.dat, the camera item has to be edited into the player's inventory, and that can then be used to place camera entities in a world.
** Used to take pictures.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative]]'''
*All worlds created before alpha 0.2.0 will be in Creative.
*[[Flying|Flight]]
**Tap the jump button twice to initiate flight. From there, double-tap and hold up or down to ascend or descend, respectively.
'''[[Survival]]'''
*[[Daylight cycle]] 
*[[Crafting]] is not yet available, making tools and anything that cannot be naturally acquired not obtainable in survival.
*Although it is survival, the user can still see all items in their inventory as though in creative mode but cannot use them unless having gathered the respective material.
** This effectively works as the [[inventory]] but lacks the standard 2×2 crafting grid from the original inventory.
* Most materials are in infinite stacks due to them not being obtainable otherwise, indicated by ∞ (infinity) symbols.
*The following materials are not in infinite stacks and have to be gathered:
**[[Cobblestone]]
** [[Log|Spruce wood]]
**[[Log|Birch wood]]
**[[Dirt]]
**[[Sandstone]]
**[[Gravel]]
**[[Stone]]
** [[Sand]]
**[[Obsidian]]
** [[Flower]]
** [[Rose]]
**[[Brown mushroom]]
**[[Red mushroom]]
**[[Cactus]]
**[[Sugar cane]]
*When an item that has not been gathered is selected, the player's fist is shown.
*Added a hit points bar (health will slowly regenerate, similar to peaceful difficulty in the [[Java Edition]]).
*Added an oxygen bar when underwater, adding the ability to drown and die.
* Added death with options to respawn or go to the main menu.
* When breaking materials, any material can be gathered regardless of what tool is used.
**For example, [[stone]] can be broken without tools and still yield [[cobblestone]], though using a [[pickaxe]] is still faster.

=== Technical changes ===
World saves are now stored in [[Bedrock Edition level format|NBT format]] instead of raw binary files.

== Fixes ==
* Leaves are no longer considered a valid support block for torches and ladders when fancy graphics are disabled.
* The player's view is once again obstructed when on fire.

== Revisions ==
The internal versions for both builds are as follows:

* 0.2.0(2005)
* 0.2.0(2006)

Both versions are 2.72 MB in size.

== J-version ==
'''v0.2.0j alpha''' was released on Google Play on an unknown release date. The internal version is 0.2.0(2003) and has a size of 1.58 MB.

== J-version demo ==
A free J-version demo of v0.2.0 alpha was released on Google Play on an unknown release date. In mid-2014, it was removed from Google Play. The internal version is the same as the j-version.

== Lite/Demo version ==
A free Lite/Demo version was released between February 17&ndash;20, 2012. In mid-2014, it was removed from app stores. The internal version is the same as the reupload.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* Even though tools are implemented in this version, the reason they were unbreakable was because durability had not been implemented until [[Pocket Edition Alpha 0.3.0]].
