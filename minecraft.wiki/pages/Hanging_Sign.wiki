A '''hanging sign''' is a variant of a  [[sign]] that displays text, and can be placed underneath blocks or with a solid self-supporting bracket. The text of hanging signs can be customized with [[dye]]s and [[glow ink sac]]s, and they can be [[wax]]ed to prevent edits.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Hanging signs can be broken with any tool or without a tool, but an [[axe]] is fastest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Hanging Sign|sprite=oak-hanging-sign|Axe|foot=1|item=1}}

Hanging signs break and drop themselves as an [[item]] if the block the sign is attached to is moved, removed or destroyed. However, this is not the case if the hanging sign is attached to a wall.<ref>{{bug|MC-256501||Hanging signs from the side / with a horizontal bar stay floating after destroying supporting block|WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
Hanging signs can be used to display text; they can be used to label storage, display information to other players or note areas of interest. Hanging signs are also not destroyed by [[water]] or [[lava]] and therefore may be used to control the flow of these fluids.

=== Placement ===
[[File:All_Hanging_Signs.png|thumb|upright|All hanging signs.]]
Hanging signs can be placed in three different ways:
* Placing a hanging sign on the side of a block results in it being placed with a self-supporting bracket, which allows it to float without any supporting block. This version can be placed in four different directions.
* Placing a hanging sign on the bottom of a block results in the sign hanging below the block.
** If the block is wide enough, the chains holding the sign are parallel. This version can be placed in four different directions.
* Placing a hanging sign under a narrow block such as chain will result in it being placed the up-arrow shape.
** If the block is too narrow, the chains meet together in a up-arrow shape. This version can be placed in sixteen different directions.
**Placing a hanging sign on the bottom of a block while sneaking will result in the sign being in the up-arrow shape.

=== Text ===
{{Main|Sign#Text}}
In regards to text editing and formatting, hanging signs behave identically to regular signs, showing up to four lines of text. However, these lines are narrower than on regular sign, meaning that a hanging sign has less space for writing. Just like regular signs, hanging signs can be [[dye]]d, the text can be made to glow by {{control|using}} a [[glow ink sac]] on the sign (a change revertable with a regular [[ink sac]]), the sign can be waxed with a [[honeycomb]] to prevent further editing (an irreversible change), and {{in|Java}}, the sign's content can be further customized with [[Commands#Raw JSON Text|JSON text]].

In [[Creative]] mode, the combination {{key|Ctrl}} + {{control|pick block}} on Windows/Linux, or {{key|cmd}} + {{control|pick block}} on macOS, can be used to copy an already-placed hanging sign, including its text (with decorations), into the player's inventory.

A dyed hanging sign facing east or west has text that appears more saturated and bright than a hanging sign facing north or south. However, it is actually the hanging sign that is dimmer, because ''Minecraft'''s lighting engine uses side lighting to make the world appear less flat, but the text on hanging signs is not affected by this.

{{IN|bedrock}}, inappropriate words or phrases in a hanging sign's text are displayed as hashtags.

=== Interaction ===
Hanging signs can be edited after being placed by {{control|using}} them, which opens the [[#Text|edit sign message GUI]].

Hanging signs are destroyed and drop as an item when pushed by a [[piston]].{{Only|bedrock}}

Hanging signs' mounting bracket are solid and have collision, the sign itself however does not.

[[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around hanging signs. Lava can create [[fire]] in [[air]] blocks next to hanging signs as if the hanging signs were flammable, but they do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either, except {{in|be}}).

=== Fuel ===
Hanging signs made of logs found in the Overworld can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 4 [[item]]s per hanging signs. Hanging signs made of logs found in the Nether (crimson and warped) cannot be used as fuel in a furnace.

=== Note blocks ===
Hanging signs can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce a "bass" sound.

=== Block data ===
A sign has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

{{el|java}}:
{{see also|Block entity format}}
<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
** {{nbt|byte|is_waxed}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the text is locked with [[honeycomb]].
** {{nbt|compound|front_text}}: A compound that discribes front text.
*** {{nbt|byte|has_glowing_text}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the sign has been dyed with a [[glow ink sac]].
*** {{nbt|string|color}}: The color that has been used to dye the sign. The default value is {{cd|black}} One of {{cd|d=and|white|orange|magenta|light_blue|yellow|lime|pink|gray|light_gray|cyan|purple|blue|brown|green|red|black}}.
*** {{nbt|list|filtered_messages}}: Only in [[Realms]]. The lines of text shown to players with the profanity filter turned on instead of the regular lines. This tag is automatically set to {{code|""}} for lines containing blocked words and to the line's normal contents for the other lines when a player with the profanity filter turned ''off'' edits the sign, so players with the filter ''on'' cannot see the blocked words. If a player with the filter ''on'' tries to use blocked words in one or more lines, the line(s) in {{nbt|list|messages}} containing blocked words are set to {{code|""}}, which makes them render completely blank, and this tag is also given the same contents. If multiple lines have been edited before the sign editing GUI is closed, only the lines containing blocked words are blanked.
*** {{nbt|list|messages}}: A list of text for each line.
**** {{nbt|string}}: Text for each line. Must be [[Raw JSON text format]].
** {{nbt|compound|back_text}}: A compound that discribes back text.　The same structure as {{nbt|compound|front_text}}.
</div>
The character limit for the Text tags depends on the width of the characters. Although the Text tags are string objects, they should contain [[Raw JSON text format|JSON text]], which are evaluated as compound objects.<section end="block data"/>
