'''Weaving''' is a [[status effect]] that lessens the movement speed decrease from being in a [[cobweb]], as well as causing [[cobweb]]s to be placed upon death.

== Effect ==
[[File:Mob With Weaving Dies.gif|thumb|A [[husk]] with Weaving dies and spawns cobwebs.]]
Entities with Weaving are less affected by the usual speed decrease that entities suffer from while moving through [[cobweb]]s, allowing them to walk through them at 50% speed instead of 25%. Weaving also causes any [[entities]] that have the effect to spawn cobwebs in an area around the entity upon its death, making it the only [[renewable]] source of cobwebs. 2-3 cobwebs can spawn in a 3×3×3 cube centered on the affected entity. The cobwebs can spawn only on top of existing blocks. These existing blocks must have a full face on the top side, meaning that cobwebs cannot spawn on top of other cobwebs. Mobs affected by Weaving emit web-like [[particles]]. When the [[game rule]] <code>mobGriefing</code> is set to <code>false</code>, entities excluding the player do not generate cobwebs upon death.
