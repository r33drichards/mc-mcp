'''MCUpdate''' is a Tumblr blog that hosted ''[[Minecraft]]'' [[version history|version changes]] and updates for the old [[launcher]] client. The blog also displayed major events such as [[MINECON Earth]] and some information from the [[Mojang blog]]. The right side contains a list of the employees, official links, and a link to the [[Minecraft Forums]].

The blog, while still available, is no longer in use as all updates have been posted on [[Minecraft.net]] since December 21, 2016.

The latest blog post was posted in Q2 2021, and contains information about the migration of Mojang accounts and the end of support of the [[Launcher 1.6.93|legacy launcher]] for {{w|Windows XP}} and {{w|Windows Vista}}.
