== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* Rewrote how blocks are rendered.
* Rewrote how [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values#Data|block data]] is handled.
** [[Java Edition removed features#Obtainable until 1.8|Removed]] the previously-accessible item forms of flowing and stationary [[water]] and [[lava]] blocks (8, 9, 10 & 11), double stone and wooden [[slab]]s (43 & 125), [[fire]] blocks (51), [[Nether Portal (block)|nether portal]] and [[End Portal (block)|end portal]] blocks (90 & 119), [[cocoa]] pods (127), and [[potato]] and [[carrot]] crops (141 & 142).  They are no longer available as item forms through the {{cmd|give}} or {{cmd|summon}} commands, but are still placeable through commands such as {{cmd|setblock}}. This removal has made by adding method registerItemBlock(block), which registers an ItemBlock for respective block. The previously-accessible item forms of these blocks is not in the registerItemBlock list, this means they do not have any registered direct item form and therefore, they are unobtainable.

'''[[Cracked stone bricks]]'''
* Can be obtained by smelting [[stone bricks]].

'''[[Tall grass]] & [[grass]]'''
* Texture is now brighter.

'''[[Huge mushrooms]] blocks'''
* When harvested with [[Silk Touch]], they drop blocks with corresponding mushroom texture (red or brown) on all sides rather than the one with spores.

'''[[Redstone torch]]es'''
* No longer randomly fix themselves.

'''[[Melon stem|Melon]] and [[pumpkin stem|pumpkin]] stems'''
* [[File:Attached Stem 14w25a.png|32px]] Now composed of two planes.

'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Use the JSON text components <code>Text1</code>, <code>Text2</code>, <code>Text3</code>, <code>Text4</code> instead of plain text.
* Can be used to show scores towards players by using the <code>selector</code> and <code>score</code> tags.
* Previously, text formatting could only be accomplished using the section symbol via [[Formatting codes]].
* Character limit is based on character width. Previously, it was capped at exactly 15 characters.
* Might need some time before it can work in Survival.

'''[[Sponge]]'''
* Introduced sponge to [[Survival mode]], with new behavior and looks.
* Turns into [[wet sponge]] when it soaks up water.
** Water particles appear around the sponge when this happens.
* Destroys water blocks from 5 blocks away in a kind of sphere.
* Soaks up water only when water is touching it.

'''[[Stairs]]'''
* All icons for stairs in the inventory are now viewed at a different angle.

=== Items ===
'''General'''
* All items are models, some are still generated from item icons.
* Resource packs can make models for all items.

'''[[Arrow]]s'''
* Work differently underwater.
** They lose all velocity after a few blocks and slowly fall.
** Fire arrows are extinguished.

'''[[Written book]]s'''
* Use JSON text components instead of plain text with the new <code>pages</code> tag.
* Capable of using the <code>clickEvent</code> and <code>hoverEvent</code> tags.
* Previously, text formatting could only be accomplished using the section symbol via [[formatting codes]].
* Might need some time before it can work in Survival.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Iron golem]]s'''
* Can be spawned by arranging the blocks in any orientation.
** This does not affect the orientation of the spawned mob.
* Now require air blocks in the corners to be built.<ref>{{bug|MC-60792}}</ref>

'''[[Snow golem]]s'''
* Can be spawned by arranging the blocks in any orientation.
** This does not affect the orientation of the spawned mob.

'''[[Wither]]s'''
* Can be spawned by arranging the blocks in any orientation.
** This does not affect the orientation of the spawned mob.
* Can now move around during the invulnerability stage right after they are spawned.<ref>{{bug|MC-57569||resolution=fixed}}</ref>
* Now require air blocks next to the base soul sand to be built.<ref>{{bug|MC-60792}}</ref>

'''[[Wither skeleton]]s'''
* No longer visibly catch fire when going into fire or lava.
* Can now spawn anywhere on nether brick within the bounds of every nether fortress, even outside of specific segments.
** Prior to this version, wither skeletons would only spawn this way in the first fortress loaded into the game due to a bug. 
** Spawning within specific segments remains unchanged and was not affected by the bug.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|scoreboard operation}}'''
* Added three [[scoreboard]] operators: <code><</code>, <code>></code>, <code>=</code>.
* Can be tested with a comparator to see if two scores are greater than, smaller than or equal to each other.

'''Model format improvements<ref>{{reddit|22vu5w/upcoming_changes_to_the_block_model_system}}</ref>'''
* New tag <code>"textures"</code> to specify the textures used by the model.
* Removed the directional attribute from the uv definition and replaced it with explicit texture references.
** <code>"textureFacing"</code> renamed to <code>"texture"</code>, it is prepended with the hash symbol (#).
* <code>"useAmbientOcclusion"</code> renamed to <code>"ambientocclusion"</code>.
* <code>"rotateVariantTextures"</code> renamed to <code>"UV lock"</code>.
* <code>"cull"</code> renamed to <code>"cullface"</code>, specifies the opposite of which neighboring face causes culling to occur.
** Example: if one has an east-facing face but wants it to be culled along a different axis (let's say Z), one would specify <code>"cullface": "north"</code> or <code>"cullface": "south".</code>
* Rotation made more verbose, it is now more clear that it can only occur on a single axis.
** Example, the rotation for one of the two faces of the "cross" model is now: <code>"rotation": { "origin": [ 8, 8, 8 ], "axis": "y", "angle": 45, "rescale": true },</code>.
* The folder <code>models/blocks/meshes</code> was removed and model files are now stored in <code>models/blocks</code>.
* The folder <code>blockstates</code> was added and stores the model selection files previously found in <code>models/blocks</code>.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Text color darkened to {{color|#404040}}, the same color as before [[Java Edition 1.2.4|1.2.4]].

'''[[Potion effect]]s'''
* Players now see better with Night Vision and Water Breathing at the same time underwater.<ref>{{bug|MC-57824||resolution=WAI}}</ref>

'''Player list'''
* Shows the faces of players.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|B}} now also shows which direction entities are looking in using a blue line.

* Items in [[first-person view]] now move up and down when its data changes.

'''Animations'''
* Block-hit animation that was used prior (from previous snapshots and 1.7.x) was removed.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* [[Falling block]] entities are now generated at the correct positions.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Anisotropic filtering has been removed.
** This also means that the four-by-four checker variant of the [[missing texture]] no longer exists.

== Trivia ==
* 14w25a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* This snapshot was released on the same day as [[Java Edition 1.7.10-pre4|1.7.10-pre4]].
* Although this was the last first-of-the-week snapshot before snapshots were said to be released on Wednesdays instead of Thursdays, this snapshot was released on a Wednesday instead of Thursday.
