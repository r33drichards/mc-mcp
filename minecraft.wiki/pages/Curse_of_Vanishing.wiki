'''Curse of Vanishing''' is an [[enchantment]] that causes the item to disappear upon death.

== Obtaining ==
Curse of Vanishing is a [[treasure enchantment]] that can be obtained from [[fishing]], [[raid]] drops{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, and [[trading]] with a librarian of any level. It can also generate in the loot chests of [[desert pyramid]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[woodland mansion]]s, [[pillager outpost]]s, [[ancient cities]], [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, and [[jungle pyramid]]s; as well as from the vaults in [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
When an item enchanted with Curse of Vanishing is in the inventory of a [[player]] who dies, it does not drop on the ground, but is removed from the world entirely. However, the item does not vanish if it is {{control|dropped}} manually or if it is placed in a container before death.

This curse does not activate when the cursed item is stored in a [[shulker box]] or [[bundle]]<ref>{{bug|MC-109053|||WAI}}</ref> or when the <code>keepInventory</code> [[gamerule]] is set to <code>true</code>.

Curse of Vanishing cannot be removed by a [[grindstone]] or a [[crafting table]]. However, if the cursed item is a [[block]], placing it will remove the curse.

If an item dropped by a mob (such as a zombie or skeleton wearing armor) has Curse of Vanishing, the enchantment works as normal.

Of all enchantments in the game, Curse of Vanishing is compatible with the greatest number of different item types. It can be added to any type of item which can be enchanted at all, including [[compass]] and [[carved pumpkin]].

The effect is insignificant in singleplayer [[Hardcore]] mode for players (though not mobs) because death is permanent, so no items can be retrieved after dying.
