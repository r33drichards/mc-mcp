{{exclusive|java}}

Each level is its own folder. A level folder is often identified by having a [[#level.dat_format|level.dat]] file, along with other subfolders to store the maps and regions of the level.

== Directory structure ==
This is the directory structure of the <code>[[.minecraft]]/saves</code> folder, where the game saves the entire [[world]] data:

== level.dat format ==
The level.dat file contains global information about the world such as the time of day, the singleplayer player, the level generator used, and the seed. When a world is loaded, the current <code>level.dat</code> is backed up to <code>level.dat_old</code>.
It is an [[NBT]] file with this structure:

== generatorOptions tag format ==
The {{nbt|compound|generatorOptions}} tag format varies depending on the generator name. It affects only the [[Overworld]] dimension. This applies to 1.15 and below.

This is the format for the [[Buffet]] world type:

<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound|generatorOptions}}:
**{{nbt|compound|biome_source}}:
***{{nbt|compound|options}}: Ignored if the [[Java Edition data values#Biome sources|biome source ID]] is <code>minecraft:vanilla_layered</code>.
****{{nbt|list|biomes}}:
*****{{nbt|string}}: A [[Java Edition data values#Biomes|biome ID]]. If this or the biome source ID is omitted or invalid, the code assumes <code>minecraft:ocean</code>.
****{{nbt|byte|size}}: The size of the biomes. Only used when the biome source ID is <code>minecraft:checkerboard</code>. The biome squares have sides of 2<sup><code><size></code></sup> (which can be < 1) [[chunk]]s. If no value is entered, the code assumes <code>2</code>.
***{{nbt|string|type}}: An applicable biome source ID. It determines how the biomes are distributed. Cannot be selected in-game and defaults to <code>minecraft:fixed</code> for unmodified [[world]]s.
**{{nbt|compound|chunk_generator}}:
***{{nbt|compound|options}}:
****{{nbt|string|default_block}}: A [[Java Edition data values#Blocks|block ID]], by default <code>minecraft:stone</code>.
****{{nbt|string|default_fluid}}: A [[Java Edition data values#Fluids|fluid ID]], by default <code>minecraft:water</code>.
***{{nbt|string|type}}: An applicable [[Java Edition data values#Chunk generators|chunk generator ID]]. It determines the overall structure of the dimension. If this is omitted or invalid, the code assumes <code>minecraft:surface</code>.
</div>

This is the format for the [[Superflat]] world type:

<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound|generatorOptions}}:
**{{nbt|compound|structures}}:
***{{nbt|compound|<structure name>}}: An empty compound named as the [[Superflat#Structure generation options|structure]], for example <code>decoration</code>. If parameters are set, for example <code>village(distance=9 size=1)</code>, then the compound contains this information.
****{{nbt|string|<parameter name>}}: The parameter value is a number represented by a string.
**{{nbt|list|layers}}:
***{{nbt|compound}}: A layer.
****{{nbt|string|block}}: The [[Java Edition data values#Blocks|block ID]].
****{{nbt|int|height}}: The height of the layer, used in worlds created before [[1.13-pre5]].
****{{nbt|byte|height}}: The height of the layer, used in worlds created since 1.13-pre5, if it's < 128 blocks.
****{{nbt|short|height}}: The height of the layer, used in worlds created since 1.13-pre5, if it's >= 128 blocks.
**{{nbt|string|biome}}: The [[Java Edition data values#Biomes|biome ID]].
**{{nbt|string|flat_world_options}}: The unescaped "[[server.properties#Java Edition 3|generator-settings]]" string. Created only if the [[world]] was generated through a [[server]]. Until snapshot [[20w11a]], it is not parsed by the game due to {{bug|MC-134900}}, thus the above compounds won't be created, making "generator-settings" ineffective.
</div>

This is the format for the [[Old Customized]] world type that existed before [[18w06a]]:
<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|string|generatorOptions}}: Controls options for the world generator. Used only if the world type is Superflat or Customized. The format for Superflat is a comma separated list of block IDs from the bottom of the map up, and each block ID may optionally be preceded by the number of layers and an "*" ("x" before 1.8). Damage values are not supported.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/ywjbk/superflat_customization/c5zusxl</ref> See detailed format for Superflat world type: [[Special:Permalink/685992#Preset_code_format|before 1.8]] and in [[Special:Permalink/1178871#Preset_code_format|1.8-1.12]]. Refer also to [[Superflat#History]] that shows how the format has been changing over time. The format for Customized world type is an extremely long String which consists of ''name:value'' pairs resembling JSON (as shown in [[Old_Customized#Presets]]).
</div>

== session.lock format ==
This file contains a single character {{Mono|U+2603 ☃ SNOWMAN}} encoded (E2 98 83) in UTF8.

The process goes something like this:
# Program opens session.lock.
# Program writes a single character ☃ (\u2603) to session.lock.
# Program tries to acquire a lock on a session.lock.
# If the lock on a session.lock fails, program aborts and gives up its lock on the level.

''Minecraft'' can sometimes try to hold the lock on a level even after the player has started playing a different level, and this can cause strange behavior. It is recommended to ensure that ''Minecraft'' is closed before trying to acquire a lock on a level.

Before 1.16, the lock contained a {{w|big endian}} 64-bit integer timestamp of when the level was last accessed since the [[Wikipedia:Unix time|epoch]]. The program, instead of writing a snowman and acquiring a lock, would monitor the file for changes, and would abort if changed.

== <samp>poi</samp> format ==
Files in the ''<samp>poi</samp>'' folder use similar structure to ''<samp>region</samp>'' [[Anvil file format|Anvil]] files (hence the ''<samp>mca</samp>'' extension), but the [[NBT]] content is different.

<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} The root tag.
**{{nbt|compound|Data}}: This tag contains all the level data.
***{{nbt|compound|Sections}}: Keys are stringified chunk section's Y coordinate ''(can be negative, a section at Y=2 starts at block Y=32)''.
****{{nbt|compound|<number>}}:
*****{{nbt|boolean|Valid}}: True (1) when created by the game, however, if the decoding of POI NBT (from the region file) data fails, and the game then save the region file again, it might save false (0). This key is internally set to true when the POI section is refreshed, and a refresh always happens when the chunk section (with terrain data) at the same coordinates is decoded. '''To sum up, it is very unlikely to get false.'''
*****{{nbt|list|Records}}: May be empty.
******{{nbt|compound}}: Single record.
*******{{nbt|int-array|pos}}: 3-element array encoding X, Y and Z.
*******{{nbt|int|free_tickets}}: Indicates how many "tickets" are available for villagers to claim. A value of zero indicates that this poi is not available for any villager to claim. Internally ''Minecraft'' specifies a max tickets for each poi type. This is the maximum number of villagers which can "take a ticket" (aka be using that poi type at the same time; aka max number of villagers which can claim that poi and store it in their "brain"). As of 1.17 all villager eligible poi type's have a ticket limit of one (1), with the single exception being <code>minecraft:meeting</code>, (block minecraft:bell) which has a limit of 32. Poi entries which are not for villager interaction such as beehives, nether portals, lighting rods, etc., have a max ticket count of zero (0) and therefore always have a '''free_tickets''' of zero as well.
*******{{nbt|string|type}}: Type of the point, for example: <code>minecraft:home</code>, <code>minecraft:meeting</code>, <code>minecraft:butcher</code>, <code>minecraft:armorer</code>, etc.
**{{nbt|int|DataVersion}}: An integer displaying the [[data version]].
</div>

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.14|dev=19w11a|The poi folder was added to world saves and village data is moved to it.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.16|dev=20w14a|Timestamps are no longer written to the session.lock file.}}
