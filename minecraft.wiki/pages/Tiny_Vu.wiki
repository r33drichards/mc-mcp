When first introduced during [[MINECON Live 2019]], Tiny Vu boasts that he can be scalable to any size, due to being "just a bunch of pixels." From there he is also shown appearing in several different [[Biome|biomes]] instantaneously, implying he has some sort of teleportation ability<ref>{{YouTube link|OZqNaEX8208|MINECON Live 2019|Minecraft|September 28, 2019}}</ref> During a video promoting the 2023 [[Mob Vote]], Tiny Vu is electrocuted by a wire, so powerful that it causes him to be sent flying backwards. He possesses no noticeable injuries afterwards, showing a high tolerance to pain.<ref>{{YouTube link|xggpxrzv_7c|Minecraft Live 2023 - The countdown is on!|Minecraft|September 28, 2023}}</ref>
