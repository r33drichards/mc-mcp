'''25w17a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.6]] released on April 22, 2025,<ref>{{snap|25w17a|id=a|April 22, 2025}}</ref> which makes the [[locator bar]] available in normal gameplay and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Locator bar]]'''
* Added [[waypoint style]] for changing waypoints' icon on specific distances in a [[resource pack]].
** Setting the style of a waypoint is possible using the new {{cmd|waypoint modify ... style}} arguments.
** The default implementation is as such:<br><syntaxhighlight lang="json">{
  "near_distance": 128,
  "far_distance": 332,
  "sprites": [
    "minecraft:default_0",
    "minecraft:default_1",
    "minecraft:default_2",
    "minecraft:default_3"
  ]
}</syntaxhighlight>
** {{cd|near_distance}} and {{cd|far_distance}} are optional and default to the values {{cd|128}} and {{cd|332}} respectively.
*** {{cd|far_distance}} distance must be greater than {{cd|near_distance}}
** Each sprite is searched within the prefix of {{cd|hud/locator_bar_dot/}} (the directory {{cd|textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot}}).

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added new video setting "Cloud Distance" to reduce the cloud range.

'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added the {{cd|#happy_ghast_avoids}} block tag.
** Contains blocks that happy ghasts avoid getting close to.
* Added the {{cd|#triggers_ambient_dried_ghast_block_sounds}} block tag.
** Contains blocks that can trigger ambient [[dried ghast]] sounds to play when a dried ghast block is placed on them.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dried Ghast]]'''
* Dried ghast's [[rarity]] has been changed from Uncommon to Common.

=== Items ===
'''[[Harness]]'''
* Can now be equipped on a [[happy ghast]] using a [[dispenser]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Woodland Mansion]]'''
* The room "{{cd|1x1_b5.nbt}}" generates again.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|waypoint}}'''
* Replaced {{cd|fade}} argument by {{cd|style}}: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances.
** {{cd|set <waypoint_style/resource>}} changes the style to a specific asset under {{cd|waypoint_style/}}
** {{cd|reset}} will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Locator Bar]]'''
* Waypoints' icon now use different sprites based on how far away the player is to their locations instead of the fade effects previously implemented.

=== General ===
'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Renamed game rule {{cd|useLocatorBar}} to {{cd|locatorBar}}, consistent with {{BE}}.

'''[[Realms]]'''
* Changed the layout of the Realms configuration screen to use tabs.
** A Worlds tab containing changes to any of the world slots, creating new worlds and changing their settings.
** A Players tab to manage the players that have access and their level of access to the Realm.
** A Subscription tab to manage the Realms subscription.
** A Settings tab to change the settings of the Realm.
* Introduced a Region Preference setting that allows for more granular control over what region a Realm is started.
* Changed the wording for Close/Open Realm to Temporarily close/Reopen Realm.

== Technical ==
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|74}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|58}}.

'''[[Shader]]s'''
* Added two new core shaders; <code>stars</code>, and <code>sky</code> which are used to render the stars and upper portion of the sky respectively.
* Post-process effects
** {{cd|Fog}} uniform block.
*** {{cd|FOG_IS_SKY}} has been removed in favor of splitting up the sky shader.

== Experimental ==
All features previously behind the "Locator Bar" [[experimental toggle]] have been de-experimentified and are now available during normal gameplay.
