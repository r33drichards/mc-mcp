'''22w12a''' is the second snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on March 24, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w12a|March 24, 2022}}</ref> which adds [[boats with chests]], the [[warden]], along with the [[Darkness]] effect and [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment, makes [[leaves]] waterloggable, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Warden Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Warden spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Warden.gif|32px]] [[Warden]]'''
* The first fully blind mob (bats have basic vision, both in game and in real life).
** Has a sense of smell. It can detect and path find toward the general location of a player or mob through a "smelling" action.
*** Prioritizes smelling the player or mob that it is most suspicious of, rather than the one closest to it.
** Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it path finds toward the source of the movement.
*** It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.
*** When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to the [[sculk sensor]].
**** If any projectile (e.g. [[egg]], [[snowball]], [[arrow]]) lands near it, the warden inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating significant vibrations. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
*** Does not detect players that are sneaking.
** Can detect players or mobs that have the [[Invisibility]] effect.
* Becomes more suspicious of a player or mob as it detects its location more through vibrations and/or smelling. When it suspects the target enough, it identifies its exact location, which aggravates it, causing it to pathfind toward the target to attack regardless of outside distractions.
* Spawns when a player activates sculk shriekers three times.
** It is the only mob that spawns in the deep dark biome.
* "Emerges" from the ground when spawned by [[sculk shrieker]]s.
** Digs back into the ground when it doesn't sense any vibration after 60 seconds.
*** Like how [[name tag]]s prevent despawning, name tags can also prevent wardens from being able to burrow back to the ground.
*** Wardens don't dig back when they're in water.
* Has {{hp|500}} health points and does {{hp|30}} damage on Normal difficulty, bringing players wearing full netherite [[armor]] from full health to {{hp|7}} health points.
* Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding the [[iron golem]] and [[enderman]] in height and width (the same).
** Wardens have long melee reach, being able to hit the player when on top of a four block pillar, thus making it capable of countering certain cheese tactics, such as pillaring.
* Wardens disable shields when they hit the players with their fists.
* The warden doesn't qualify as a target for the advancement "Monster Hunter" and isn't needed to receive the advancement "Monsters Hunted" due to its role.
* Warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the Darkness effect.
** The core creates a low throbbing or "heartbeat" sound as it pulses. The sound and animation speed up rapidly as the warden gets more suspicious of or closer to attacking a player or mob.
* Is immune to [[lava]] and can float up lava columns very fast.
* Is immune to knockback and never slows down in water.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''{{Animate|Oak Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png; Spruce Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png; Birch Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png; Jungle Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png; Acacia Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png; Dark Oak Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png; Mangrove Boat with Chest JE2 BE1.png|32px}} [[Boat with chest]]'''
* Function similarly to [[minecart with chest]]s, but in boats instead, so player can take a journey on the water and carry things.
* Crafted by combining a [[chest]] with any [[boat]].
* Opening its inventory or breaking it makes nearby adult [[piglin]]s angry.
* Breaking it drops itself (as opposed to a [[minecart with chest]], which splits into its components), and all its items.
* Can hold only one entity.
* The chest on the "Boat with Chest" is 1 pixel smaller then a normal chest.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Effect]]s'''
* [[File:Darkness JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Darkness]]
** A status effect triggered by the [[sculk shrieker]], causing the player's camera to dim in brightness, thus limiting the vision of players.
** Lowers the gamma down at an equivalent of “Moody” while having this effect.

'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Added the [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment.
** Has three levels.
** Can only be applied on [[leggings]].
** Allow the player to walk faster while sneaking, up to 75% of normal speed at level III.
** Currently cannot be obtained in Survival.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* A new accessibility slider has been added in the options menu called “Darkness Pulsing”.
** It controls how dark the Darkness effect gets when a warden or [[sculk shrieker]] gives it to the player.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added a new particle: <code>shriek</code>, for the pulse that is admitted when triggering a sensor.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>chest_boats</code> item tag.
** Contains all types of [[boat with chest]]s.
* Added the <code>warden_events_can_listen</code> game event tag.
** Contains the contents of the <code>#vibrations</code> event tag (except <code>flap</code>), <code>sculk_sensor_tendrils_clicking</code> and <code>shriek</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Leaves]]'''
* Are now waterloggable.
* Mangrove leaves are now compostable.

'''[[Sculk catalyst]]'''
* Can no longer generate [[sculk shrieker]]s.

'''[[Sculk sensor]]'''
* Now always activate when stepped on, even when sneaking.

'''[[Sculk shrieker]]'''
* Added functionality.
** Has the ability to "shriek", emitting ring-like/sonic particles.
** Is activated by a [[sculk sensor]], [[redstone]] signal or player's stepping.
*** Sculk shriekers summon [[warden]]s only if there isn't one within 48 blocks.
** Gives players the Darkness effect when activated.
** If activated three times, a warden is summoned from the ground.
*** Player has 4 levels of {{nbt|int|warning_level}} (0-3). Every time a shrieker is activated, the level increases by 1, and never decreases.
*** If a player had successfully summoned a warden, only one activation is required to summon a warden next time.
* Currently does not drop when broken, even when using [[Silk Touch]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Boat]]s'''
* Changed item textures of all boats, except mangrove.
** Now their paddles represent their respective wood color and their inside rims of the boats are darker, to match {{BE}}.
*** Oak boat item texture in {{JE}} and {{BE}} still have differences.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Parrot]]s'''
* Can now imitate [[warden]]s.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Deep dark]]'''
* Now less flooded than surrounding areas.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locatebiome}}'''
* Now searches in 3D properly, which means it locates cave biomes correctly.
* Now returns all three coordinates in the output.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen#More debug-keys|Debug keys]]'''
* Removed debug hotkey cycling render distance ({{key|F3+F}}).

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* The parameters to the <code>vibration</code> particle have changed: instead of specifying the start position as an extra parameter, the regular source of the particle is now used.

'''[[Shader]]s'''
* There are now shader files for translucent entity rendering.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Mangrove boat and the <code>#chest_boats</code> item tag are now part of the <code>#boats</code> item tag.
* Mangrove leaves is now part of the <code>#mineable/hoe</code> block tag.
