{{About|the descriptions shown in Pocket Edition|their Legacy Console Edition equivalents|Legacy Console Edition descriptions}}
{{Outdated feature|edition=bedrock|Item descriptions from crafting/stonecutting were removed in [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]], and from smelting in a later update.}}

In alpha builds of {{edition|pocket}}, crafting interfaces held descriptions for the item to be crafted.

== List ==
Below is a table of all item descriptions. Descriptions for uncraftable items also appear to exist despite not having anywhere to be displayed.

All items are listed in the order as they are found in the <code>en_US.lang</code> file, which means blocks and items are not grouped by material or utility. The table is sortable and can be sorted alphabetically.
