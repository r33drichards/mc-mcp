=== Technical ===
'''[[Add-On]]s and Script Engine'''
*Added the ability to define the order for the items for the creative inventory and recipe book, called the crafting item catalog, for new items added by packs. New items can either merge with existing groups, create new groups with your own item for the icon, or just become added as loose items without a group. This catalog should be saved as {{cd|item_catalog/crafting_item_catalog.json}} in player's behavior pack.
*Item and Block json files now require a namespace for group names in the {{cd|menu_category}} object. 
*Added new Creator toggle setting "Show Content Log GUI On Error During Load".
**This setting will make the Content Log GUI automatically open and display after loading into a world and there was either warnings or errors found during the loading process.
**This setting is disabled in the [[Editor]].

'''[[API]]'''
*Updated numeric JavaScript enums now properly handle and support reverse value mappings. 
*{{cd|InputPermissions}}
**Moved the following {{cd|InputPermissionCategory}} enum values to {{cd|1.17.0}}: {{cd|LateralMovement}}, {{cd|Sneak}}, {{cd|Jump}}, {{cd|Mount}}, {{cd|Dismount}}, {{cd|MoveForward}}, {{cd|MoveBackward}}, {{cd|MoveLeft}}, and {{cd|MoveRight}}.

***{{cd|isPermissionCategoryEnabled(permissionCategory: InputPermissionCategory): boolean;}}
***{{cd|setPermissionCategory(permissionCategory: InputPermissionCategory, isEnabled: boolean): void;}}
*Removed the {{cd|compostingChance}} available from the {{cd|ItemStack}} API. The composting chance for Vanilla items can now be accessed via the singular {{cd|CompostableItemComponent-}}.

*Fence gate blocks use state {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} instead of {{cd|minecraft:direction}}. Uses string values ({{cd|north}}, {{cd|south}}, {{cd|east}}, {{cd|west}}).
*Door blocks use state {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} instead of {{cd|minecraft:direction}}. Uses string values ({{cd|north}}, {{cd|south}}, {{cd|east}}, {{cd|west}}).
*Removed content log error: 'Block needs both a geometry and material instances component'.

'''Collisions'''
*Entities with no collision box but with the {{cd|minecraft:custom_hit_test}} component are no longer sometimes unable to be interacted with.

'''[[Command]]s'''
*The {{cd|mine}} overload of the {{cmd|loot}} command has been moved to outside of "Upcoming Creator Features" experiments.
*The {{cmd|kick}} command now allows use of target selectors on Realms.
*{{cmd|wsserver}} command disabled by default. Enable in General Settings.
*Websocket encryption default enabled for all platforms.

'''Components'''
*The [[strider]] now makes use of the {{cd|minecraft:movement_sound_distance_offset}} component for its movement sound distance offset.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:renders_when_invisible}} component, which enables entities to render even when invisible.
**Appropriate rendering behavior can then be specified in the corresponding {{cd|minecraft:client_entity}}.
*Moved the {{cd|minecraft:liquid_detection}} component out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment for {{cd|format_versions}} 1.21.60 and above.
*Expand the {{cd|minecraft:breedable}} component to allow inheriting properties to child entities.
**Adds the new {{cd|property_inheritance}} field which takes property name keyed objects.
**The objects in {{cd|property_inheritance}} can contain a {{cd|mutation_chance}} which give the chance it should not inherit from either parent.
**They can also contain the {{cd|mutation_values}} array of values to select from if mutating and the component has random mutation set.
*Added {{cd|min_looked_at_duration}} field to {{cd|minecraft:looked_at}} component to specify how long a stare has to be maintained before the target and cooldown logic is set.

'''Entity Components'''
*The {{cd|minecraft:breedable}} component now has a field that enables the offspring's {{cd|minecraft:color}} attribute to be a blend of the parents' {{cd|minecraft:color}}.
**{{cd|combine_parent_colors}}, If a color mutation will not happen, the baby will get a combination of the parents' colors if the colors are compatible. Color combinations follow the rules of {{cd|DyeItem}} combinations. If the colors are not compatible the baby will get one of the parents colors chosen randomly.
***Valid values: {{cd|true}}, {{cd|false}}.

'''Entity Filters'''
*Added new entity filter {{cd|home_distance}}, which checks the distance of an entity from its home.
**Requires the subject entity to have a {{cd|minecraft:home}} component.
**Returns {{cd|false}} if the subject has no home or if the home is in a different dimension.
*Added new entity filter {{cd|is_bound_to_creaking_heart}}, which checks if the creaking heart that spawned the subject creaking still exists.

'''Graphical'''
*Improved logic for handling very large textures within atlases. Textures that are guaranteed to overflow the maximum atlas size will now have mips dropped individually rather than forcing the entire atlas to drop mips.
*Single-channel textures in resource packs are now interpreted as grayscale, rather than red. This change does not apply to single-channel UI textures, which were already interpreted as such.

'''Graphics'''
*{{cd|client_biome}} JSON files now support a {{cd|surface_opacity}} field in the {{cd|minecraft:water_appearance}} component.
**This change also restores {{cd|swampland}} and {{cd|warm_ocean}} surface opacity to what they were until recently when the {{cd|client_biome}} JSON files were introduced.
*Added support {{cd|minecraft:foliage_appearance}} and {{cd|minecraft:grass_appearance}} components in {{cd|client_biome}} JSON files to control color or palette selection for foliage and grass rendering.

'''[[Item]]s'''
*Added a content warning to the {{cd|minecraft:durability_sensor}} item component's {{cd|particle_type}} when an invalid value is provided.

**{{cd|minecraft:hand_equipped}}
**{{cd|minecraft:stacked_by_data}}
**{{cd|minecraft:foil}}
**{{cd|minecraft:block}}
**{{cd|minecraft:use_duration}}
**{{cd|minecraft:max_stack_size}}
*Removed "Upcoming Creator Feature" toggle requirement for {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}} item component.
*Migrated {{cd|ItemData}} from {{cd|StartGamePacket}} into {{cd|ItemRegistryPacket}} (renamed from {{cd|ItemComponentPacket}}).

'''[[Sound]]s'''
*Added {{cd|base}} parameter to block sounds specifying another block sound they should use sounds for if they do not define a sound themselves.

'''Network Protocol'''
*Added {{cd|ActorFlags::RENDERS_WHEN_INVISIBLE}}.

'''Stability and Performance'''

*Focus Target Camera now displays a command output error when trying to target an entity when not on a free camera or custom camera that inherits from free camera. 
*Focus Target Camera {{cd|vertical_rotation_limits}} are now in world space. 0 degrees is straight down, 90 degrees is horizontal and 180 degrees is straight up. The limits for the values are [0, 180] inclusive.

'''Molang'''
*Moved {{cd|query.last_input_mode_is_any}} to stable. It takes one or more arguments ({{cd|keyboard_and_mouse}}, {{cd|touch}}, {{cd|gamepad}}, or {{cd|motion_controller}}).

'''Scripting API'''
*Moved enum {{cd|InputMode}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|InputInfo}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
**Moved property {{cd|lastInputModeUsed}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
**Moved property {{cd|touchOnlyAffectsHotbar}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
*Class {{cd|Player}}
**Moved property {{cd|inputInfo}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerInputModeChangeAfterEvent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerInputModeChangeAfterEventSignal}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.17.0}}.
*Class {{cd|WorldAfterEvents}}

'''Stability and Performance'''
*Experimental support for applying a service-driven texture memory budget in low memory situations. When enabled, memory will be conserved by progressively reducing resolution of some textures as usage approaches the budgeted limit.

'''UI'''
*Added support for input glyph replacement for signs, signed books, and NPC dialogs. For example, using input string {{cd|:_input_key.jump:}} will be replaced with "JUMP" when using keyboard, or an emoji in case of using a gamepad.
*Added full support and fixes for some input glyph replacement strings. This is to make them work across all the platforms (PC, Consoles, Mobile).
*These are the values fixed:
**{{cd|:_input_key.forward:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.back:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.left:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.right:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.inventory:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.use:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.chat:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.attack:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.sprint:}}
*The icons for these strings are updated in diverse areas of the game that support contextual glyphs, such as: signs, signed books, tags, chat, commands.
*Also, as improvement, replacement of these values depends on the interaction/control mode when using touch as input mode. These modes are Joystick & tap to interact, D-Pad & tap to interact, and Joystick & aim crosshair.
