This guide is a simplified overview of '''all non-experimental changes''' in the Bundles of Bravery drop ({{BE}} 1.21.40), which assumes at least some familiarity with the [[Tricky Trials]] update (''Bedrock Edition'' 1.21.0 to 1.21.31), excluding experimental features in these versions.

* Updated the rules under which bats spawn in the world:
** Bats can now spawn at any height, provided the area is covered and sufficiently dark.
** They must spawn on one of the following blocks: stone, granite, diorite, andesite, tuff, or deepslate.
** As a result, bats may now happen to spawn above the surface.

* Store up to a stack's worth of mixed item types within itself in a single inventory slot.
** The space taken up by an item depends on its stack size. For example, an item that stacks to 16 (like [[snowball]]s) will take up four times as much space as an item that stacks to 64 (like [[stick]]s).
** Items that do not stack (like [[sword]]s) occupy the entire bundle.
* Can be dyed in 16 different colors.
