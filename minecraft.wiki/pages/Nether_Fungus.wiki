A '''Nether fungus''' is a mushroom-like block that generates in [[the Nether]]. There are two types of fungi: [[Crimson Fungus|crimson]] and [[Warped Fungus|warped]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A fungus can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] and always drops itself. Mining a [[flower pot]] containing a fungus drops both items separately.
{{breaking row|Nether Fungi|link=Nether Fungus|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Fungi naturally generate in the [[crimson forest]] and [[warped forest]] biomes, with each fungus most commonly generating in its respective biome and less frequently in the other.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a fungus drops the fungus upon death.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|crimson-fungus}}

=== Post-generation ===
Applying [[bone meal]] to [[nylium]] causes fungi to appear nearby, similar to [[flower]]s on [[grass block]]s. While fungi of both types and other Nether vegetation can generate this way, they are more likely to be the same type as the nylium.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
[[File:FungusPlaceBlock.png|thumb|All of the blocks that fungi can be placed on.]]
Fungi may be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[podzol]], [[farmland]], [[rooted dirt]], [[moss block]]s, [[nylium]], [[mycelium]], [[soul soil]], [[mud]] and [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Attempting to place it on any other block fails. Fungi requires a solid block underneath it, and pops off and drops itself if it is no longer supported.

Fungi can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Growth ===
When [[bone meal]] is {{ctrl|used}} on a fungus that is planted on matching [[nylium]], it has a 40% chance to grow into its tall equivalent (similar to [[sapling]]s and [[mushroom]]s). Crimson and warped fungi grow into crimson and warped [[huge fungi]], respectively. The [[log|stem]], [[shroomlight]], or [[wart block]]s may replace certain blocks including [[slab]]s and [[torch]]es.

=== Breeding ===
Crimson fungus can be used to breed [[hoglin]]s and keep them from despawning, but feeding hoglins does not stop them from attacking the player. Warped fungus can be used to breed [[strider]]s and lead them around if crafted as a [[warped fungus on a stick]].

=== Hoglins ===
All [[hoglin]]s, regardless of age, avoid and run up to 7 [[block]]s away from warped fungus when it is placed on a block or inside of a [[flower pot]]{{only|JE}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-75166||Hoglins are not repelled by warped fungus in flower pots}}</ref>. Held warped fungi and warped fungi on sticks do not have this effect.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Crimson Fungus, Warped Fungus}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a fungus into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
