A '''block of gold''', internally known as a '''gold block''', is a precious [[metal]] block equivalent to nine [[gold ingot]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Blocks of gold can only be mined with an iron pickaxe or better.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Block of Gold|Pickaxe|Iron}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[Ocean monument]]s have a central room containing 8 blocks of gold encased in [[dark prismarine]].

Blocks of gold generate as part of [[ruined portal]]s and [[bastion remnant]]s in varying quantities.

== Usage ==
Blocks of gold are a compact way to store [[gold ingot]]s.

=== Beacons ===
Blocks of gold can be used to "power" a [[beacon]]. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square with blocks of gold underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely made with blocks of gold, as they may also contain [[blocks of iron]], [[blocks of emerald]], [[blocks of netherite]], and [[blocks of diamond]].

=== Note blocks ===
Blocks of gold can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce bell sounds.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s run toward any block of gold item on the ground and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory. They become enraged if the player breaks a block of gold near them.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Tower of Pimps.png|frameless|right|32px]]
*In ''Xbox 360 Edition'', before TU19, four blocks of gold stacked on top of an obsidian block could be found inside the tutorial world's desert pyramid. This is a reference to [[wikipedia:Achievement Hunter|Achievement Hunter's]] ''Let's Play Minecraft'' series, in which this combination is used to create the "Tower of Pimps" (seen right), a structure first created by [[wikipedia:Gavin Free|Gavin Free]], which is now used in many episodes as a trophy.
*If one block is considered to be equal to one cubic meter, then one block of gold has a mass of 19,320 kilograms, making it the heaviest real-world matter available in vanilla ''Minecraft'' if [[element]] blocks are not considered. A player's inventory has 37 slots (including the offhand slot), and each can carry 64 blocks of gold; therefore, a player can carry a maximum number of 45,749.76 metric tons of mass, not considering armor or putting things in shulker boxes (theoretically increasing the mass by 27 times).
