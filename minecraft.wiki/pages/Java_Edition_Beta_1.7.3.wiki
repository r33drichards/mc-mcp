'''Beta 1.7.3''' is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]] released on July 8, 2011,<ref>{{tumblr|MCUpdate|7376697767|Minecraft Beta 1.7.3|July 8, 2011}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in [[Beta 1.7.2]].

== Fixes ==
'''9 bugs fixed'''
* Corrected a block duplication bug when using [[piston]]s.
* Corrected a [[redstone torch]] duplication bug when using pistons.
* Corrected a client crash when placing a [[sign]] in front of the piston, powering the piston and then removing the [[block]] beneath the sign.
* [[Ice]] blocks are now pushed without causing [[water]] streams to break everything.
* [[Powered rail]]s are no longer being powered magically without a power source.
* Pistons connected to the end of a piston transistor via [[redstone]] are now properly closed when the power goes out.
* [[Door]]s no longer create purple particles.
* Modified clients can no longer edit texts of placed signs in [[multiplayer]].
* Changed so that [[painting]]s pushed by pistons will pop off.

== Trivia ==

* This was the last version to:
** be released before the game started getting official pre-releases
** feature the old [[Biome/Before Beta 1.8|pre-Beta 1.8 terrain generator]]
*** Due to the this, Beta 1.7.3 was also the last {{JE}} version where the player could visit the [[Far Lands/Java Edition/Pre-Beta 1.8|Far Lands]].
** include a dirt background in the title screen
** use the unlicensed copy message
** have a hotkey for controlling fog
** not include [[Creative Mode]] accessibly
** not have [[hunger]], [[experience]], or [[status effect]]s
** not have the brightness or FOV slider in the Options
