'''{{cmd|structure}}'''
* Added the ability to animate the placement of a structure.

== Fixes ==
'''Performance and Stability '''
* Fixed a crash on that could occur when Player 1 in a split-screen session disconnects their controller. ({{bug|MCPE-99565}})

'''Graphical'''
* Touchscreen input "Chat and Commands" UI element now has a darker border.  
* "Tip" messages no longer appear off screen.
* Changed vignette layer from 4 to 5 to prevent drawing vignette in between hotbar items.
