The '''camera''' is an inanimate [[passive mob]]<ref group="note" name="mob-family">Belongs to the <code>mob</code> entity family in the game's code.</ref> that is able to capture and store images. {{IN|edu}}, it works together with the [[portfolio]] item to create collections of [[photo]]s.<ref name="screenshot-edu">https://aka.ms/MEEBookAndQuill</ref>

== Obtaining ==
The camera can be obtained in the [[Creative inventory]] in ''Minecraft Education''. It can be obtained by either NBT editors, inventory editors, or glitches {{in|Bedrock}}.

== Usage ==
Using a camera from one's [[inventory]] captures a first-person screenshot. It may also be placed, creating a camera [[entity]] that can track the user, and take pictures from the camera's perspective. Photos that are taken with the camera appear in the [[portfolio]].

Close-up snapshots of an [[item]] on the ground can be taken by holding the Shift key while right-clicking.

Screenshots from camera can be inserted into [[book and quill]].<ref name="screenshot-edu"/>

Photos that are taken with the camera block are stored in {{cd|[[com.mojang]]/screenshots}}.

== Behavior ==
[[File:CameraMob in a boat.png|thumb|Camera in a [[boat]]]]
Cameras are mostly inanimate [[entities]], but they occasionally move when falling and they move at the [[player]]'s direction when they take a picture.

Cameras are classified as [[mob]]s in the game code, they obey gravity, allowing them to fall and having effects common to all other [[entities]]. Cameras can be affected by [[status effects]]. They can be killed by [[Harming]] and [[Decay]] splash/lingering potions, and they play the player death sound and fall to their side and disappear, dropping no item. Cameras can't be [[leashed]] but they can ride on [[boats]] and [[minecart]]s.

[[File:CameraMob being damaged by poison.png|thumb|Camera being harmed by [[poison]] effect]]
Cameras are harmed by [[fire]], [[lava]], and [[campfire]] damage but they never die from it. Cameras can be destroyed by any [[projectile]] used by the player, such as [[arrows]], [[tridents]], or [[snowball]]s. Cameras never drown and are invulnerable to the [[void]], [[cacti]], [[falling block]]s, to [[explosion]]s or by [[firework rocket]]s.

[[Warden]]s, [[wither]]s, [[zoglin]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[vindicator]]s named Johnny attack cameras, but the camera remains undamaged; [[pufferfish]] also inflate when a camera is nearby. [[Foxes]] don't sleep near cameras as well.

|{{HistoryLine||v0.2.0|[[File:Camera BE2.png|50px]] [[File:Music Disc Blocks JE1 BE1.png|32px]] Added cameras.
|Changed item and tripod textures.
|To use a camera, equip it in the [[player]]'s hand, then look in the direction the player wants the picture to be taken. Long-press the screen, and a camera [[drops]] to the ground where the player are standing. Step back, then press on the camera until it starts emitting smoke [[particles]]. The smoke means a picture has been taken, and the camera may disappear immediately afterward.
|Cameras have infinite uses.
|The entity ID is 62 and item 456.<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1233138-i-found-the-camera-id/</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.4.0|The camera is now invisible and makes the standard player [[damage]] sound.}}

|{{HistoryLine||v0.8.0|dev=build 2|[[File:Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] The camera now uses an [[egg]] texture in the inventory.}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.9.0|dev=build 1|The camera [[entity]] has been removed. [[Tommaso]] also stated: ''"It doesn't mean that it's dead forever, in fact I have a lot of ideas for it!

|{{HistoryLine||v0.14.0|dev=build 1|[[File:Camera BE3.png|32px]] [[File:Camera (item) BE2.png|32px]] The camera entity has been re-added with a new model and item texture.
|Cameras summon [[lightning]] if a player loads a world with one.}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.14.2|The camera [[item]] ID has been changed to 498, but it cannot be used at the moment. The [[entity]] can now be spawned with a [[spawn egg]] with a [[damage]] value of 62.
|According to the language files of the game, the empty label that shows up whenever hovering a finger to a camera would now say "Take Picture". However, the button doesn't do anything.}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.15.0|dev=build 1|The previous empty label on the camera mentioned above now displays the words "Take Picture". It still doesn't do anything.
|The [[health]] of the camera [[entity]] is now {{hp|2}} instead {{hp|4}}.
|The camera no longer summons [[lightning]].}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.16.0|dev=build 1|[[File:Camera (block).png|32px]] The camera now appears as a [[block]] in the inventory. It can also be placed as a block using [[commands]].
|The "Take Picture" button now appears to function properly, but no image files are created.
|The changes to the camera were likely accidental due to ''Pocket Edition'' sharing the same codebase as ''Education Edition''.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=build 2|The camera [[block]] form is no longer obtainable.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=build 4|The camera's item form has been removed, and the camera can no longer be obtained or placed using any [[command]].}}

|{{HistoryLine||1.13.0|dev=beta 1.13.0.1|The camera can no longer be obtained with the {{cmd|give}} command.
|Functionality has been added to the camera. Screenshots that are taken by the camera can now be saved into the {{cd|screenshots}} folder.
|Cameras are now a part of the {{el|ee}} toggle as a hidden feature.
|Cameras no longer have a [[death]] animation when killed by the [[player]] and instead, instantly emit smoke [[particles]].}}

=== Future ===
At the Minecraft [[Pocket Edition]] panel at [[MINECON 2012]], as well as one of [[Johan Bernhardsson|Jbernhardsson]]'s livestreams, it was stated that future plans include trying to have a proper use for cameras, perhaps an easier way to take screenshots and share them with others.<ref>{{ytl|YMhyX_lKWV4}}</ref> In the BlockTalk Q&A, the camera was briefly mentioned as part of a broader "sharing" theme planned for {{el|be}} in the future.<ref>{{ytl|Ruf6tvqsD84}}</ref>
It later got implemented into {{el|ee}}, using the camera to make screenshots and share them in a special book.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* A camera prevents a [[book and quill]] from working. Attempting to craft it or obtain it by commands gives a regular book instead, due to non-implementation of photo attaching to written books.{{verify|this feature is implemented in Minecraft Education, perhaps not in Bedrock Edition?}}
* The camera can take a screenshot, which appears a bit smaller with a thick paper outline having cuts on its edges, making it look like an old photograph.
