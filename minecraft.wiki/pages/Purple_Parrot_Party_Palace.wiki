'''Purple Parrot Party Palace''', also known as '''Purple Party Parrot Palace''',<ref name=":Purple Party Parrot Palace">{{Mcnet|free-minecon-stuff-marketplace|Free MINECON stuff on Marketplace!|November 13, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref> is a  [[Marketplace]] map that explores various features, such as [[parrots]].

== Summary ==
=== Jungle ===
[[File:Distinctly not the Purple Parrot Party Palace.png|thumb]]
The map opens inside of a treehouse in a [[jungle]], the player awakening from their [[bed|green bed]]. Inside of an [[ender chest]], labeled as a "mailbox," the player will find [[book]] marked ''Invitation'', by "Pete."

''Hi there,''

''You have been invited to a Party at the Purple Palace.''

''We will be getting together later today.''

''Hope to see you there!''

''Pete the Parrot''

In order to reach the party, the player is encouraged by two [[signs]] to glide there using a pair of [[elytra]]. Next to an [[enchanting table]] in the room is a [[chest]], filled with 18 stacks of [[firework rockets]] and five elytra. Behind the table is a [[wooden stairs|plank]] the player can use to jump off and fly, gaining height using the rockets. If the player is disinterested in that, they can also lift off from an upper floor with a [[crafting table]], and a lower floor that leads to a colossal flight of stairs, where they can climb down to the ground via [[vines]]. After taking flight, the player will be guided by several purple [[beacons]], marking a path that contains a surface path for those who don't travel by elytra.

On the [[beach]], the surface path will convert to a [[jungle planks]] stairway that transitions into a bridge and then a [[ladder]], and then a bridge through the jungle. Eventually, that will lead into a small hut, with a chest full of [[bread]], and two upper floors. The middle floor will have another bridge, whereas the top gives room to glide if desired. Continuing forward, the bridge is noticeably more narrow, with [[fences|birch fences]] on the side, giving little actual protection. The end of the bridge leads to several more ladders, as the player climbs up to a [[mountain]] scraping the sky.

Walking through [[clouds]], the player will have to climb up many more stairs, before arriving at a [[cobblestone]] structure. This can be identified by both its almost exclusively cobblestone build, and a mysterious room lined with [[torches]]. From there the player will now march up narrow strips of [[cobblestone stairs]], [[snow]] gradually appearing until the player may notice a statue of a parrot. At that point more and more statues will appear, the player elevating themselves with [[smooth stone slabs]] and then descending to follow many more beacons. Soon enough, the titular palace will be visible not terribly far away, accessible from a [[polished diorite]] staircase. 

=== Purple Palace ===
Passing through a diorite chamber, the player will finally reach the eponymous palace, entering its turf by a tower lined with [[blocks of quartz]] and [[blocks of emerald]], near another beacon. Before the player can travel any further, they might notice another chest, containing a book labeled ''Misplaced Music''.

''Hi,''

''Thanks for coming! I want to welcome you to the Purple Palace, we are super excited that you are here.''

''The party is about to start but we misplaced the music we want to play.''

''It's called "[[Music Disc wait|Wait]]"''

''P.S.''
if you want one of us to go with you, just feed one of us some [[seeds]] and they will follow you!

Now given an objective, the player will find a ''Fireworks Station'' below the diorite stairs. Inside serves as a mini-tutorial for crafting fireworks, with [[item frames]] illustrating recipes, and chests full of [[paper]], [[gunpowder]], [[dyes]], and [[firework stars]]. Beside the  of that is the ''Fireworks Crafting Room'', filled with many crafting tables and full chests of many items used for fireworks, including [[fire charges]], [[diamonds]], and [[creeper head|creeper heads]]. Behind that is a [[dispenser]], set up for the purpose of testing "your own fireworks," and next to that are three more dispensers for specific types of fireworks. Exiting through the Fireworks Station, the player will find a similar build, this time for a blue firework specifically, and below that is a button for activating "a big fireworks show," in truth giving the player [[Music Disc 11|music disc 11]] In the distance, the player will eye a fireworks contraption in a [[lake]], identifiable by several [[glowstone]] blocks.

Returning to the plaza, the player will be greeted with a large fountain, [[oak trees]], [[quartz pillar|quartz pillars]], and a small station for playing music discs. Inside the [[dropper]] will be [[13]], [[Mall]], [[Music Disc Chirp|Chirp]], [[Music Disc Blocks|Blocks]], and [[Music Disc Cat|Cat]], which can then be automatically loaded into a [[jukebox]]. Nearby is a sign promoting the [[Music Pack]], addressing the potential lack of music. From there the player can enter the ''Hall of Heraldry'', a center for crafting [[banners]] similar to the ''Fireworks Station'' but much larger, with hundreds of torches lining up paths and pillars covered in vines. Amongst the crafting tutorials, the player can find massive statues and [[stained glass]] windows of a purple parrot, and at the end a prompt to enter 11. Placing the disc into the jukebox will reveal the disc for Wait.

Nearly complete with the miniature quest, the player can advance to the end of the plaza, adorned with a brief tip on [[armor stands]]; they can take multiple poses and hold many items, such as [[elytra]], [[golden leggings]], and [[bottle o' enchanting]]. Another brief tip will be given a step above, that armor stands can detect [[redstone]] signals, before the player passes two stands wearing [[diamond armor]] and enter the building. Walking onto a [[wooden pressure plate]] will cause many parrots to spawn and float down onto the player. Placing the disc will cause the parrots to begin dancing, purple fireworks to go off, and armor stands to dance to the rhythm. This soft-concludes the map.
