The '''desert hills''' were a variant of the [[desert]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]] and were removed in ''Java Edition''.
== Description ==
Like all other hills [[Biome|biomes]], desert hills featured hillier terrain with occasional overhangs, cliffs, and floating islands. Sand often generated floating here, providing a risk of suffocation when the sand fell down. Desert hills were comprised mostly of [[sand]] and [[sandstone]] like the rest of the desert. No biome-specific structures other than [[Fossil|fossils]], [[Desert pyramid|desert pyramids]],{{only|bedrock}} and [[Desert well|desert wells]] generated within this biome, making this variant overall more difficult and less rewarding. Desert hills didn't generate in the thin desert border around a [[badlands]] biome.

== Mobs ==
Desert hills used the same mob spawning chances as deserts.

The following mobs naturally spawned here:
