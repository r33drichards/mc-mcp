'''Tiers''' refer to the different levels and materials of [[tool]]s and weapons.

== Tiers ==
There are currently seven tiers in the game: wood, gold, stone, copper, iron, diamond, and netherite. The tier of an item determines its mining level, durability, [[mining efficiency]], damage bonus, enchantability, and repair item.

== Mining level ==
Mining level is an internal numeric value used by [[pickaxe]]s that represents an additional restriction to whether or not blocks drop anything when [[mined]], in addition to requiring the correct tool type. While it is used only by pickaxes, other tools have mining level values internally that match their tier.

A block with the [[tag]] <code>minecraft:needs_stone_tool</code><ref group=note name=mininglevel1>Includes [[iron ore]], [[copper ore]], [[lapis lazuli ore]], [[deepslate iron ore]], [[deepslate copper ore]], [[deepslate lapis lazuli ore]], [[blocks of copper]], [[blocks of raw copper]], [[blocks of iron]], [[blocks of raw iron]], [[blocks of lapis lazuli]], [[cut copper]] and its variants, and [[lightning rod]]s.</ref> requires a mining level of 1 or higher, a block with the tag <code>minecraft:needs_iron_tool</code><ref group=note name=mininglevel2>Includes [[diamond ore]], [[emerald ore]], [[gold ore]], [[redstone ore]], [[deepslate diamond ore]], [[deepslate emerald ore]], [[deepslate gold ore]], [[deepslate redstone ore]], [[blocks of diamond]], [[blocks of emerald]], [[blocks of gold]], and [[block of raw gold]]</ref> requires a mining level of 2 or higher, and a block with the tag <code>minecraft:needs_diamond_tool</code><ref group=note name=mininglevel3>Includes [[ancient debris]], [[obsidian]], [[crying obsidian]], [[blocks of netherite]], [[respawn anchors]], and [[glowing obsidian]]{{only|BE|short=1}}.</ref> requires a tool with mining level 3 or higher. If a block has no mining level tags, it can be mined with a mining level of 0. There is an unused 4th mining level with the tag <code>minecraft:needs_netherite_tool</code>.

== Affected items ==
All of the [[sword]]s, [[axe]]s, [[pickaxe]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[hoe]]s, and [[spear]]s use tiers.
