'''10 Years of Minecraft''' is a [[DLC]] map released on May 9, 2019 on both ''[[Java Edition]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', celebrating the [[10th Anniversary]] of ''Minecraft''.

== Summary ==
=== The Vault ===
Players begin the map in a [[desert]], outside a [[desert pyramid]] marked by the 10th anniversary logo. Right beside the entrance are two [[chests]], containing 54 total unique "Anniversary Golden [[Minecarts]]," which the player can use inside on a [[track]] that recaps the last ten years of Java Edition updates. At the end of the track is a collection of numbered [[buttons]], with another chest containing a [[map]] and [[book]], labeled ''The Vault'' and credited to BlockWorks. Inside is an explanation of the surrounding area, an expansive locked door into the Vault itself.

To open it, the code is 170509. Once the combination is input, the door will open between both sets of buttons, revealing a fancy, dimly lit museum with a directory immediately visible. Beside it are two stairways, leading down to another minecart track that takes the player to the Mob Gardens. The first room of the museum itself is split between inorganic blocks, such as [[stone]] and [[gravel]], and organic blocks, such as [[coral]] and [[cacti]]. Chests containing books explaining each block in detail are placed about. In the center of the room is a [[gray stained glass]] floor, showing another recreation of the Minecraft 10th anniversary logo below.

At the north end of the room is a large quartz staircase, leading up to the second floor with an array of functional blocks, such as [[crafting table]]s and [[sponges]]. Unlike the preceding floor, this area is much more angular and adorned with [[end rods]], with [[stained glass pane]] railings over holes giving a look at the bottom. Also different on this floor is that the blocks are grouped into categories, in the form of utility blocks and mechanisms. Behind the staircase is a small room, labeled ''Minecraft: A History'', where players can find a condensed history of the franchise surrounding [[birch]] trees. These include Minecraft's player count,  the release of [[Lego Minecraft]], the release of [[Minecraft Story Mode]], the founding of the [[Minecraft Marketplace]], and various [[Minecon]]s.

A few blocks away from the first stairway is another, leading up to a slanted display of "manufactured blocks," such as [[banners]]. Another collection of blocks reside southwest of this, giving a large view of all three floors of the Vault. Also present on the third floor are large [[cyan stained glass]] windows, designed to mimic [[diamond ore]].

=== Biomedomes ===
Located to the north of the Vault, the Biomedomes are blocked by an expansive puzzle, where the player must jump across several [[chunks]]. If they touch the incorrect chunk, they will be teleported back to the start. In order to cross, players will need to read a book given right before, and memorize the pattern given. Upon completing the challenge, the player will be able to access the Biomedomes proper, and are given a [[heavy weighted pressure plate]] that can warp them back to the Vault.

Marching up a grand flight of stairs, players will enter into a recreational [[plains]] [[village]], with a puzzle nearby. Inside a chest is a [[diamond shovel]] and book named Adventuring Time, tasking players with collecting a [[poppy]], [[dandelion]], [[melon slice]], [[carrots]], [[lily pad]], [[beetroots]], [[nether wart]], [[red mushroom]], [[chorus fruit]], and [[rose bush]]. The poppy and dandelion are plentiful throughout the village, while [[beetroot crops]] and can be found in nearby farms. [[Melons]] can be found in a [[jungle]] area not far from the farms, the lily pad in a [[swamp]] close to the prompt, mushroom in a [[flower pot]] in a [[witch hut]], and rose bush in a [[forest]] far from the other biomes. Other biomes featured are [[dark forest]]s and [[birch forest]]s, and inside them are chests, containing explanations of the biomes in question.

The plants from other dimensions can be found by {{control|swimming}} down the well in the village, which drops the player down an abrupt tunnel into a [[stronghold]] marked with yellow [[thing]] banners. The stronghold is split between two paths, the [[Nether]] to the right and [[End]] to the left. The Nether section is set in a large [[nether wastes]] biome, littered with [[torches]]. Patrolling the grounds are [[wither skeletons]] and [[blazes]], which will chase after the player as in [[survival mode]]. The nether wart will be found inside of a [[nether fortress]], which will require a lengthy fight with the mobs.

The End section is a combination of the inner and outer End, beginning with a recreation of the [[ender dragon]] arena with the [[ender dragon egg]] on top of the [[exit portal]]. Beyond that is an [[end city]], complete with [[shulkers]]. Uniquely, on the second floor is a shulker [[monster spawner]]. Climbing upwards, players will find two chests, one containing two [[diamonds]] and a [[stick]], the other two diamonds, a [[shulker shell]] and [[shulker box]]. At the very top is a chest containing a book on the outer islands of the End. [[Chorus plants]] can be found below.

Once all the plants are found, a second chest will generate beside the flower bed, containing an [[diamond sword|anniversary golden sword]].

=== The Academy ===
Located to the east of the Vault, players will have to solve a puzzle before entering the building itself. The starting area of the region is a strip of land lined with [[stone bricks]] and [[white concrete]], with a chest containing instructions. Players will have to decipher a message written in the Standard Galactic Alphabet, using a codec credited to [[Herobrine]]. Pressing a button will teleport the player to a [[barrier]] block above the area, revealing a large statue of a book with the text in question. At the very end of the area is a building in the shape of an [[enchanting table]], where they can input the answer using various levers above items, such as [[turtle shell]]s.

The message on the book translates to "I have a spine, front and back but bones and teeth are what I lack, on me you can write your name but first craft me with 3 sugar-cane." This teaches the player to pull the levers for books and [[sugar canes]], which will open stained glass gates, allowing entry into the Academy. Climbing up dark oak stairs, players can advance up on top of the enchanting table, and climb the [[enchanting book]] into the Academy, passing a directory and iron pressure plate that warps the player back to the Vault.

The Academy is a large building modeled after a college, with the first room to the left of the entrance being a cafeteria with a checkerboard floor pattern, and obscured to the right a classroom with [[oak planks]] for the floor and a [[green terracotta]] chalkboard. In the proceeding hallway are two bathrooms, marked light blue and pink with toilets made of [[snow layers]] and gray carpets, and mirrors made of banners. From there is another door into the cafeteria, and a splitting hallway to the east and south. To the east is a large statue of an [[agent]], with nearby exits to roads of [[dirt paths]]. To the south is a similar exit, leading to a fountain with a humanoid figure, as well as an indoor stairway lined with [[anvils]]. Immediately on the second floor are two more classrooms and bathrooms, though differently designed, with the bathroom being reachable through a one block wide wall.

Returning to the Agent statue, players can make a turn to the left and discover a large assortment of displays on school subjects, including Art & Design, History & Culture, Math, Science, Computer Science, and Language Arts. In front of these is another book, simply labeled Education, explaining [[Minecraft Education]]. Above the area is a large recreation of the game's former logo. To the right of the Agent statue are several actual agents, making a "special visit" to vanilla Minecraft, as explained in a book marked "Robot." In this area, players are tasked with programming the agents, leading them to a [[block of gold]]. Four of these puzzles are present, with [[diamond axe]]s and exclusive "Robot Controller" blocks being given to assist.

For the first puzzle, they player will simply need to replace a Robot Controller and rotate it to face the gold, which it is directly next to. If a robot controller is removed with an agent on it, it will die and need to be respawned by a nearby button. The second puzzle will be to the right, and require reorienting three blocks, first to face the south, west, and south again in an L-shape. The third puzzle counterclockwise will be similarly simple, requiring a U-shaped path path to be straightened. This and the fourth puzzle require the agent to be spawned manually, as opposed to the others which have it naturally. The final puzzle will be in a W-shape, requiring a more complicated order, with blocks ordered in the east, south, east, south, and west.

Upon completing the Robot Minigame, a chest will appear next to the introduction chest, rewarding the player with a special anniversary golden bow and 28 arrows. Behind the puzzle is a large floor map, telegraphing the locations of Block by Block projects across the world, and a book with the achievements of Block by Block.

=== Mob Gardens ===
[[File:Mob Gardens entrance.png|thumb|Entrance to the gardens.]]
Located to the south of the Vault, directly behind the entrance, Mob Gardens is preceded by a collection of oversized [[spawn eggs]] amongst a [[badlands]] biome. Inside players will find a book, explaining a series of riddles that will enable players to enter the garden proper. Inside the [[parrot]], [[creeper]], and [[enderman]] eggs are [[levers]], which open the path to the gardens. Players can climb into the eggs via [[ladders]], finding very little beside [[carpets]]. Once all three are pulled, players can transcend [[stone brick stairs]] up into the true Mob Garden, a  modern dome house many of the [[mobs]] of the time, adorned with stained glass windows of mobs such as [[pigs]] and [[Steve]]. Upon entering the garden, players will find another directory and a fast travel back to the Vault.

To the left of the entrance are exhibits of passive mobs, all noticeably larger than normal, beginning with [[tropical fish]], [[mules]], [[skeleton horses]], and [[villagers]]. Similar to the Vault, there are chests containing books explaining the mobs' behavior and lore. At the very end of the room are a circular display for [[parrots]] and [[bats]], with the chests a considerable distance away from the mobs. In the center of the museum is a large spire of [[water]], surrounded by neutral mobs such as [[llamas]] and [[spiders]]. The right wing is devoted to hostile mobs, with [[elder guardians]] inflicting [[mining fatigue]] upon approach. Similar to the left wing, at the end is a circular area featuring flying mobs, in this case the [[Wither]], a [[phantom]], a [[ghast]], and a [[blaze]]. Between both wings are spiral staircases up to catwalks above the displays.

Returning to the spire, curious players will be able to discover a hole in the center, revealing a secret basement in the form of a mysterious garden lined with [[polished diorite]]. Traveling down a wooden path will inevitably lead the player to collide with [[tripwires]] surrounded by [[skeleton skull]]s, which summon various enemies such as [[skeletons]], [[endermites]], [[vexes]], and [[vindicators]]. Traveling through sections themed around the End, Nether, an [[ocean monument]], the player will emerge in a chamber filled with banners of Herobrine, and be rewarded with eleven [[enchanted apples]], in the shape of the number 10.

=== The Museum of Redstone ===
Located to the west of the Vault, the Museum of Redstone is surrounded by a gigantic recreation of a circuit board. In order to enter the building, players will need to activate ten [[redstone lamps]], marked by a [[spruce]] device in the center. These lamps are activated by clicking ten levers in the area, on the sides of small structures, which contain [[redstone blocks]] and [[cobblestone walls]]. Upon opening the door, players can proceed into a [[polished andesite]] tunnel into a gigantic [[piston]], climbing a large flight of stairs up past a directory and arrive in a courtyard marked by statues composed of [[redstone blocks]].

The Museum itself is a large, open building made of terracotta and [[acacia]], surrounded by lamp fixtures made of floating pistons. Up another set of stairs, players will find a chest in front of a redstone device, containing a book tasking the player with lighting various blocks up. In the center of the room are several unlit lamps, which light up with your progress. To the left of the entrance room is a large hallway, containing tutorials for various redstone mechanisms, such as [[redstone torches]] and [[T flip-flop]]. Following a path modeled after a [[redstone wire]] will eventually lead to a lower floor, containing the Redstone Grove, a zoo area filled with [[_Jeb]] sheep and a redstone environment. The trees are [[redstone lamps]] on [[block of redstone]] trunks, abundant [[tulip|red tulips]], and [[redstone ore]]s scattered throughout every stone source. At the bottom is a book, explaining the lore of the grove in a poem.

In order to "light up the building," the player will need to interact with each of the tutorials. The lever, locking [[repeater]], and redstone torch, and T flip-flop lights can be completed with a simple {{control|use}}. For the button, they have to use a [[bow]] to shoot the button, which breaks in one use. The [[detector rail]] requires pushing the minecart on top of the detector, while the [[daylight detector]] can be solved by either turning it to detect shade or pulling a hidden lever on the ceiling to reveal sunlight. In the chest of the tripwire chest are 14 [[coal]] in the shape of a ten, with the book in the zero. Once all are activated at once, the player can progress to the right wing.

Similar to the left wing, the lever, AND gate, [[comparator]], puzzles can be solved with basic interaction. There are four [[comparator]] puzzles, the first requiring filling a chest with coal, the second uses a [[hopper]] that requires 160 coal, the third pulling several levers, and the fourth a specific lever out of six. The [[slime block]] puzzle needs the player to pull a middle lever and slightly obscured right lever. Also similar to the left wing is an attraction at the end of the wing, in this case an out of order elevator.{{More info}}

Upon completing every puzzle, a large double chest will be revealed, containing anniversary golden [[armor]]. Another activity the player can do is climb somewhat obscure stairways in the lobby, which will lead into an attic area with a large redstone contraption held up by [[cobblestone walls]]. Proceeding up another, spiral staircase will lead players into an observatory, revealing the device to be a [[TNT cannon]]. Before it is another chest, containing a book explaining some lore about the machine and [[chain boots]] enchanted with [[feather falling]] IV.

Another collection of stairs lie back on the first floor, positioned behind giant claws hung by the lamp puzzles. On the surface, they would appear to be a viewing area, similar to the catwalks in Mob Gardens. At the end are another set of stairs lined with [[acacia logs]], leading up to a gallery of various redstone machines. On the left wing are several "armouring machines," the first simply made of stone blocks, stone bricks, and dispensers. The second, labeled Armouring Machine 2.0, is a plate of [[blocks of iron]], with [[birch fence]] posts on the corners, and four dispensers surrounding [[soul sand]] in the center. On the right wing is a complex contraption made of multiple [[wool]] blocks, marked as out of order.

=== Golden Apples ===
In the corners of the map are six Golden Apples, structures in the shape of golden apples that are accessed through railways underneath the Vault. The first available is from the entrance to Mob Gardens, leading to the southwest apple. Inside each of the Golden Apples is a parkour challenge, leading to the top of the apple, where the player is rewarded with an enchanted golden apple. Once all six are completed, as well as any of the primary puzzles across the map, the player will be teleported "back to spawn" on a large platform, filled with cakes and containing a chest with several items.

Inside the chest are two [[music disc]]s, both of the song Happy Birthday. One is sung in English and sung by the employees of [[Mojang Studios]] in Redmond, while the other is in Swedish and from Stockholm. Opposite to those are a Special Anniversary Minecart and Special Minecart Key. The Minecart summons an entity when placed, which possesses an [[inventory]] with 12 slots, and can be ridden by putting the key in the saddle slot. While ridden, it allows the player to fly. Also on the platform is a creeper entity that dances, before turning into a large grass block, thanking the player for exploring the map.

Welcome to the Vault!

Here you will find every block in Minecraft, safely under lock and key.

Not really, it's much more high-tech than that. The Vault uses a super secret 6-digit code, which you'll never guess!

Now, what was it again?

Having looked after Minecraft's blocks since day 1 I'm getting awfully forgetful!

I really should write it down somewhere...

Block by Block began in 2012 with the radical idea of integrating the computer game Minecraft into public space planning to get community members more involved.

A collaboration between Mojang, Microsoft and UNHabitat, Block by Block allows everyone to have a say in the design of their local public space by using Minecraft as a collaborative design tool.

After a project location is selected, a 3-day workshop is held where community members share and discuss different ideas, before building them in Minecraft.

These Minecraft designs are then passed on to architects and local authorities who, with the help of Block by Block, build the real-world public space on the Minecraft model.

Headed to the Mob Gardens?

You'll need to solve the Riddle of the Eggs first!

3 of these eggs contain levers which open the gate to the Mob Gardens - it's up to you to find out which! Here are some clues to get you started:

1. Play a jingle and I'll flap and wriggle, but don't feed me chocolate - for my kind it's toxic!

2. Roses are red, violets are blue, give me a hug and I'll hug you back - BOOM!

3. They travel in hauntings, and are most certainly daunting. These tall chaps will disappear in a snap!

=== The Vault ===

==== Natural Blocks ====
{{BlockSprite|air}} '''Air'''
{{Collapse|content=Air is generated in any space not occupied by a block. It is created and destroyed when blocks are removed and placed, so it cannot be kept in your inventory. Air’s presence often gets unnoticed and unappreciated.

Of course, that’s until you start to run out of it while swimming!|title=}}
{{BlockSprite|andesite}} '''Andesite'''
{{Collapse|content=Andesite is a decorative variant of stone that generates in the Overworld. It can be mined with a pickaxe or crafted with cobblestone or diorite}}
{{BlockSprite|diorite}} '''Diorite'''{{Collapse|content=Diorite is a decorative variant of stone that generates in the Overworld. It can be mined with a pickaxe or crafted by combining cobblestone with nether quartz.}}

{{BlockSprite|granite}} '''Granite'''{{Collapse|content=Granite is a decorative variant of stone that generates in the Overworld. It can be mined with a pickaxe or crafted by combining nether quartz with diorite.}}

{{BlockSprite|bedrock}} '''Bedrock'''
{{Collapse|content=Try as you might, this block is impossible to break unless you’re in Creative mode! You can find bedrock protecting you from the Void at the lowest five levels of the Overworld, and at the top and bottom of the Nether.

Bedrock was added to Minecraft on the tenth day of the game’s development. This means that bedrock was added to the game before water, lava, ores, and logs!}}
{{BlockSprite|bone-block}} '''Bone Block'''{{Collapse|content=I’ve got a bone to pick with you! Bone blocks are decorative blocks that are naturally generated as a part of fossil structures found in desert and swamp biomes. Aside from decoration, they can be used to store bone meal.

Bone blocks can be mined with any pickaxe. If they are broken without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.}}

{{BlockSprite|clay}} '''Clay'''{{Collapse|content=Clay is obtained from clay blocks, which are found at the bottom of lakes, rivers, and swamps. Each clay block will drop four pieces of clay that can be crafted together.

There are many decorative uses for clay, and depending on whether you smelt the entire block or its individual pieces, you will gain different final products!}}

{{BlockSprite|coal-ore}} '''Coal Ore'''
{{Collapse|content=When mined with a pickaxe, coal ore will drop a single piece of coal. If it’s mined with a Fortune enchantment, the ore may drop an extra piece of coal per enchantment level, to a maximum of 4 coal with Futune III.

When used in a furnace as a fuel, it will last 80 seconds and smelt up to 8 items.

Can’t find coal? Burn some logs and you’ll get charcoal, which has the same properties as coal!}}
{{BlockSprite|dirt}} '''Dirt'''
{{Collapse|content=Dirt! Making up most of the Overworld’s upper layers in various thicknesses, it lies unseen below a single layer of grass. It can be obtained by hand, but a shovel is the fastest way to dig it up.

Dirt also drops if you break grass, mycelium, or podzol without a Silk Touch tool.

Not sure what to do with all your dirt? Consider building a farm! Unless you plan on hunting or fishing all day, building a farm is the easiest way to create a renewable source of food.

So, while it may seem like a rather simple and common block, dirt is useful! Besides, how else are you supposed to survive the first night without building a dirt hut?}}
{{BlockSprite|coarse-dirt}} '''Coarse Dirt'''
{{Collapse|content=Coarse dirt is a variation of dirt that grass or mycelium will not spread on. Visually similar to regular dirt, it can be crafted by combining gravel and dirt.

It spawns naturally in the Overworld in all Giant Tree Taiga biomes, Wooded and Modified Wooded Badlands Plateaus, and Shattered Savanna Plateau biomes.}}
{{BlockSprite|podzol}} '''Podzol'''
{{Collapse|content=Podzol is a variant of dirt that generates in giant tree taiga and bamboo jungle biomes as well as their respective variants.

When broken, it will drop a regular block of dirt unless it is mined with Silk Touch. Podzol allows mushrooms to be placed on regardless of the light level, which allows for the growth of huge mushrooms.

Unlike grass and mycelium, however, podzol does not spread.}}
{{BlockSprite|grass-block}} '''Grass'''
{{Collapse|content=Along with cobblestone, grass was one of the first two blocks added to the game. This iconic block generates naturally in most biomes in the Overworld. 

If you right click it with a shovel, it will be turned into a grass path.

But grass is delicate. If a block is placed on top of it, or if it is broken by anything other than a Silk Touch tool, it will transform into regular dirt.

Then there are the mobs! Sheep like to eat it, and endermen like to steal it! At least the endermen will drop the grass block if they are killed - no Silk Touch required!

With all these ways for your grass to be messes around with, it sure is tough maintaining a perfect front lawn! Luckily, grass spreads to nearby dirt blocks, so it will grow back!}}
{{BlockSprite|mycelium}} '''Mycelium''' 
{{Collapse|content=Mycelium is a variant of dirt that generates instead of grass in mushroom fields biomes! If mycelium is mined with anything other than a Silk Touch tool, it will only drop dirt.

Endermen can pick up mycelium blocks, and will drop the block they are holding if killed. This is one way to obtain mycelium if you do not have Silk Touch! As with grass, mycelium is capable of spreading to nearby dirt blocks.

While mushrooms normally need low light levels to be placed, they can be placed on mycelium blocks in any light level. Huge mushrooms can also be grown on mycelium.}}
{{BlockSprite|cobblestone}} '''Cobblestone'''
{{Collapse|content=You’ve reached the Stone Age! This incredibly common block is gained by mining stone with a pickaxe of any level. It is one tier better than wood, and required if you plan on crafting a furnace or advancing further in the game!

Don’t feel like leaving your home to gather cobblestone? Create your own cobblestone generator with a bucket of lava and a bucket of water! When flowing water and lava come into contact with one another another, a block of cobblestone will be created!}}
{{BlockSprite|mossy-cobblestone}} '''Mossy Cobble'''{{Collapse|content=A sure sign of a dungeon! Greener than its plain variant, mossy cobblestone is, well, covered in moss. This can be found in dungeons, jungle temples, the giant tree taiga biome, and in underwater ruins.

It can generate in pillager outpost watchtowers, as well as in plains, taiga, and snowy villages. Alternatively, it can be crafted by combining cobblestone with vines.}}

{{BlockSprite|cobweb}} '''Cobweb'''{{Collapse|content=Be careful not to get stuck in the cobwebs! If you get caught, you will get slowed down drastically until you are able to wiggle free. You can quickly break cobwebs with a sword to get string, or you can use shears to obtain the cobweb itself. 

You can find large amounts of cobwebs in abandoned mineshafts, particularly around cave spider spawners.}}

{{BlockSprite|end-stone}} '''End Stone'''
{{Collapse|content=End stone is a block that generates exclusively in the End. Aside from generated structures, it makes up the entirety of solid ground existing in the End. 

With a blast resistance of 45, end stone cannot be picked up by endermen nor can it be destroyed by the ender dragon. This makes it a useful defensive block both inside and outside of the End!

But don’t forget to grab some before you leave! As it is the only block that you can place chorus fruit on, you will need to take some home with you if you want to grow any chorus plants!

End stone can be mined with a pickaxe of any level.}}
{{BlockSprite|sand}} '''Sand'''
{{Collapse|content=Sand generates naturally in many Overworld biomes, but it will always be found in deserts, beaches, and rivers. Red sand generates in badlands biomes and its variants. It is also almost always used to cover up buried treasure chests!

Since a shovel is the fastest method of breaking and obtaining sand, make sure to keep a shovel handy if you’re on a treasure hunt!

While sand generally appears in layers that are four blocks deep, supported by stone or sandstone, sand can also spawn floating in the air.

Be careful! As sand is affected by gravity, if you place or break a block near this precariously perched pile of sand, the entire cluster will come crashing down!

Sand that falls on a mob or player will cause them to suffocate. But sand that falls on non-solid blocks, such as tour he’s, redstone dust, rails, or slabs, will break and drop a block of sand instead of piling up. 

Sand can be used to craft a number of decorative blocks, and it is also one of the two main ingredients required to craft TNT. When smelted, it will produce glass.}}
{{BlockSprite|soul-sand}} '''Soul Sand'''
{{Collapse|content=Covered in tiny screaming faces, soul sand is found below Y level 65 in the Nether or in the nether wart room of nether fortresses. It is used for growing nether wart, but four pieces of soul sand are also required to construct a wither!

Soul Sand will slow the movement of any player or mob that walks over it. If it is placed above ice, packed ice, or slime blocks, the slowing effect will be even stronger!

When it is placed underwater, it will also release a column of bubbles that will speedily lift any players, mobs, and items up to the surface!}} 

{{BlockSprite|stone}} '''Stone'''
{{Collapse|content=One of the earliest blocks added to the game, stone is an extremely common block that is found in the Overworld. It will drop nothing unless mined with a pickaxe, in which case it will drop cobblestone.

Cobblestone can be smelted in a furnace to transform it back into stone. Stone will also be created if lava comes in contact with flowing water.

Stone is everywhere! So much so that it almost had a place in the very name of the game! Before Minecraft was known as “Minecraft”, the game was nearly called “Minecraft: Order of the Stone”!}}
{{BlockSprite|diamond-ore}} '''Diamonds''' 
{{Collapse|content=DIAMONDS! There are few other blocks with such excitement upon their discovery. Generating naturally in the world below Y level 16, diamond ore will drop diamonds when mined with an iron or diamond pickaxe.

{{BlockSprite|iron-ore}} '''Iron Ore'''
{{Collapse|content=Generating between Y levels 1 and 63, iron is the most common mineral block that can be used to craft armour and tools! Arguably the next best alternative to diamond, you need at least a stone pickaxe in order to mine it.

As it does not generate above Y level 63, you will not be able to find iron ore in the upper levels of mountain biomes.

Iron ore is only useful once it is smelted into iron ingots, which can be crafted into better armour, tools, and weapons!

Of course, you can also craft yourself a handy bucket or a pair of shears.}}

{{BlockSprite|fire}} '''Fire'''
{{Collapse|content=Fire is a harmful non-solid block that will spread to nearby flammable blocks unless fire spread has been turned off with the command /gamerule doFireTick false. Blocks and item that catch fire will burn for some time before being destroyed.

Even with fire spread enabled, all is not lost! Fires eventually burn out on their own. However, fires started on netherrack or magma blocks will burn forever, and will need to be put out manually.

Coming in contact with fire will set you on fire. You can either wait for it to burn out, or you can jump in water to extinguish the fire before it does too much damage!

Tired of waiting for lava, lightning, blazes, and ghosts to start fires for you? You can light your very own fires with a flint and steel or fire charge! Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!}}

Players can avoid taking fire damage from magma blocks by using fire resistance potions, wearing Frost Walker boots, or simply sneaking while walking across them.

Underwater magma blocks create whirlpool bubble columns that drag any items, boats, mobs, or players caught in them at the bottom of the sea. Luckily, you can restore your air by swimming through a magma block’s bubble column.

But be careful! Despite being underwater, magma blocks will still hurt you if you come in contact with them.}}

{{Collapse|content=Glowstone is a light-emitting block that occurs naturally in the Nether. It generates in clusters that hang from the underside of netherrack.

Unless it is mined with Silk Touch, glowstone will shatter into 2-4 pieces of glowstone dust. If it is broken with a Fortune tool, it has a higher chance to drop more glowstone dust, but it will never drop more than four pieces of dust.

You can craft four pieces of glowstone dust back together to form one piece of glowstone.

or on soul sand, it will break and drop a piece of gravel instead of piling up. 

When broken, there is a 10% chance that a piece of flint will be dropped instead of gravel.

The Fortune enchantment increases the chance of flint dropping to 14% at Fortune I, 25% at Fortune II, and 100% chance at Fortune III.}}
{{BlockSprite|netherrack}} '''Netherrack'''
{{Collapse|content=Netherrack makes up a majority of the Nether’s terrain. Breaking netherrack by hand will yield nothing, but mining it with any pickaxe will shred through it in a fraction of a second!

Speaking of decorative blocks, netherrack can be smelted and crafted into nether brick blocks, so you don’t even need to find a nether fortress if you want some!}}
{{BlockSprite|obsidian}} '''Obsidian''' 
{{Collapse|content=Anyone interested in taking the Ice Bucket Challenge? Running water over lava source blocks will create obsidian, but it will require a diamond pickaxe to successfully mine it.

With a blast resistance of 6000, obsidian has the highest blast resistance a player can obtain in Survival mode, which explains why it takes so long to mine!

But since it’s required to build a nether portal or craft a beacon, enchantment table, or ender chest, it’s definitely worth the wait!}}

Water will spread downwards endlessly as long as there is available space below it. However, it can only flow 7 blocks horizontally from its source block if it is on a flat surface, washing item along with it.

Item that are dropped in water will eventually float back to the surface. 

To get through water, you will need to swim! Unlike items, you do not float. Underwater, you have 15 seconds before you begin to run out of air, so make sure to remember to swim back to the surface to catch your breath!}}
{{BlockSprite|sea-lantern}} '''Sea Lantern'''
{{Collapse|content=Sea lanterns are underwater light sources that appear in ocean monuments and in underwater ruins. The sea lantern itself can only be mined with a Silk Touch tool. If it is broken by anything else, it will drop 2-3 prismarine crystals instead.

Since it does not drop any prismarine shards when broken, the other material required to craft sea lanterns, this is a very insufficient way to gather sea lanterns.

Similar to soul sand, your movement speed will be slowed when you walk over a slime block.}}
{{BlockSprite|oak-stairs}} '''Stairs'''
{{Collapse|content=Stairs are blocks that allow players and mobs to ascend and descend blocks without jumping. They also have a lot of decorative potential! Stairs can be placed in many different orientations depending on which direction you are facing when you place them.

You can also attach stairs to create inner and outer corners. Wood stairs can be broken successfully with anything, but all other types require a pickaxe!}}
{{BlockSprite|stripped-oak-log}} '''Stripped Logs'''

{{Collapse|content=Stripped logs are variants of logs that are obtained by using an axe on a log. This is only a visual change, as stripped logs can be used interchangeably with regular logs in all crafting recipes. It comes in six species: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia

and dark oak}}{{BlockSprite|stripped-oak-wood}} '''Stripped Wood'''

{{Collapse|content=Stripped wood is a variant of wood that is obtained by using an axe on a block of wood. It has the stripped wood bark texture on all six sides. This is only a visual change, as stripped wood can be used interchangeably with regular wood in

all crafting recipes. It comes in six species: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia and, and dark oak.}}{{BlockSprite|Oak wood}} '''Wood'''{{Collapse
|content=
Wood is a block that has the log's bark texture on all six of its sides. It comes in six species: oak, spruce, jungle, acacia, and dark oak. Four logs can be crafted together to make three wood.

This is only a visual change as the wood can be used interchangeably with logs in all crafting recipes.
}}{{BlockSprite|stone-bricks}} '''Stone Bricks'''
{{Collapse|content=Stone bricks are a decorative block that comes in four variants: stone bricks, cracked stone bricks, mossy stone bricks, and chiseled stone bricks. Stone bricks can be crafted from four stone.

They generate naturally in strongholds, igloos, and underwater ruins. If they are mined with anything other than a pickaxe, they will break and drop nothing. Be careful while mining out bricks in strongholds!

Silverfish have the ability to enter and hide in any variant of stone bricks! This creates an infested variant of the corresponding block type.}}

=== Biomedomes ===
{{BiomeSprite|badlands plateau}} '''Badlands Plateau'''{{Collapse
|content=
Badland plateaus are rare dry and warm biomes. They feature large hills comrpised of layered terracotta. The tops of these hills flatten out into plateaus that are typically covered in dead bushes.

The sides of the plateau can occasionally reveal exposed mineshafts!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Birch Forest}} '''Birch Forest'''{{Collapse
|content=
If you like birch trees, then this is the biome for you! As you may have guessed, a birch forest is a biome that is filled with a forest of birch!

Birch forests are a part of the temperate and lush biome family. Unlike regular forests, wolves will not spawn in birch forests.
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Dark Forest}} '''Dark Forest'''{{Collapse
|content=
It sure is dark in here! With a thick canopy of leaves, dark forests are a part of the temperate and lush biome family. As the dark oak trees generate so closely together, it becomes dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn during the day!

Huge mushrooms can also grow amongst the dark oaks.

There is an extremely rare chance that a [[woodland mansion]] will generate within a dark forest! This is the only biome that woodland mansions can appear.
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Desert}} '''Desert'''{{Collapse
|content=
Deserts are common, dry and warm biomes that are usually vast, barren, and lifeless. Deserts were among the first biomes added to the game!

Passive mobs do not spawn and trees do not grow in the desert, making it a challenging biome to survive in at the beginning of the game.

Cacti and dead bushes are naturally generated within the terrain.

Deserts make up for their barrenness by generating a number of different structures within them! These include villages, fossils, desert wells, and desert temples!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|The End}} '''The End'''{{Collapse
|content=
It may be the End, but it isn't the end! The End is a dark, space-like dimension floating in the void. It can be accessed by entering an End portal gateway portal found in strongholds.

The End's central island serves as the main platform for your boss fight with the ender dragon. Large obsidian pillars and end crystals generate naturally on the central island. There is no way to exit the End unless you die or defeat the ender dragon!

Planning on making the End your home? If you place a bed, it will create an explosion that is 25% stronger than TNT. Yikes!

Other than the ender dragon, endermen are the only other residents of the End's main island.
}}
{{BiomeSprite|forest}} '''Forest'''{{Collapse
|content=
Composed of oak and birch trees, forest biomes are a part of the temperate and lush biome family. With an abundance of wood and mild terrain, forest biomes are often preferred by beginners!

Wolves rarely spawn in forest biomes, making forests the only other biome aside from taigas where wolves can spawn!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|frozen ocean}} '''Frozen Ocean'''{{Collapse
|content=
Frozen oceans have dark purple water. Like other cold ocean biomes, frozen oceans have a seafloor composed of gravel. The ocean is completely barren as nether seagrass nor kelp generates naturally.

The most prominent features of frozen oceans are the large icebergs made of snow blocks, packed ice, and blue ice that frequently generate on the surface of the water.

Polar bears and strays are capable of spawning on those icebergs. Salmon, squid, and drowned are the only aquatic mobs that can spawn in the water in frozen oceans.

Frozen oceans will never generate directly next to land. There will always be at least 32 blocks of a cold ocean bordering it if it happens to generate near land!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Frozen River}} '''Frozen River'''{{Collapse
|content=
Characterized by the icy river winding throughout, frozen river biomes only generate when a river biome enters or comes in contact with a snowy tundra biome.

Frozen rivers are part of the snowy biome family.

Despite the covering of ice over the river, salmon and drowned are still capable of spawning underwater. At night, strays will also spawn above the ice.
}}
{{BiomeSprite|old-growth-spruce-taiga}} '''Giant Spruce'''{{Collapse
|content=
Similar to the taiga biome, giant spruce taiga biomes are covered in spruce trees. However, unlike regular taigas, giant spruce trees now grow beside the normal spruce trees!

Mossy cobblestone boulders are scattered throughout the biome, along with patches of podzol, dirt, and coarse dirt.

This rare biome can be difficult to differentiate from the giant tree taiga biome, but you can tell which biome you are in by looking at the leaves of the giant spruce trees!

If the spruce leaves only grow at the top of the trunk, you are in the giant tree taiga, not a giant spruce taiga!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Ice Spikes}} '''Ice Spikes'''{{Collapse
|content=
Characterized by large spikes of packed ice and packed 'ice lakes', ice spikes are a rare variation of the snowy tundra biome.

While most of the ice spikes are 10 to 20 blocks tall, some of the other spikes can reach over 50 blocks in height!

As all grass blocks have been replaced by snow blocks in this biome, no passive mobs other than rabbits and polar bears are able to spawn. At night, strays will spawn as well.


}}
{{BiomeSprite|windswept hills}} '''Mountains'''{{Collapse
|content=
Cliffs, peaks, valleys, waterfalls, and more! Mountain biomes stretch high into the sky, reaching heights of Y level 130 and even higher!

With very few trees, this cold biome is grassy, but areas above Y level 92 are dusted with snow.

Mountains are the only biomes where emerald ore and silverfish can be found naturally!

Aside from savannas, mountains are the only bimes where llamas will spawn.
}}
{{BiomeSprite|mushroom fields}} '''Mushroom Fields'''{{Collapse
|content=
What is that strange land on the horizon?

Mushroom fields are rare biomes that spawn in oceans as islands, completely isolated from any other landmasses.

As the ground is covered in mycelium instead of grass, mushrooms are ablt to grow in full sunlight! It is also one of the few biomes where huge mushrooms generate naturally.

While secluded, these biomes are very safe to explore, as mooshrooms are the only mobs that spawn in mushroom fields! Even the usual hostile mobs do not spawn at night!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Nether wastes}} '''The Nether'''{{Collapse
|content=
The Nether is a molten, hell-like dimension that is full of fire, lava, and dangerous mobs! In order to travel to the Nether, you must construct a nether portal in the Overworld.

The terrain of the Nether is almost entirely made up of netherrack and vast expanses of lava. Clusters of glowstone dangle from the ceiling and mushrooms grow abundantly on the ground.

Soul sand and dangerous patches of floating gravel will also generate throughout the Nether. Near the oceans of lava, you can find patches of magma blocks.

Nether fortresses are the Nether's only naturally generated structures. While they provide valuable loot, be careful as they are also the only place where blazes and wither skeletons spawn!

Feel like mining? Nether quartz can be found scattered around the netherrack. It is the only mineral ore that can be found in the Nether.

Traveling through the Nether may be dangerous, but it is great for fast travel! For every block you travel in the Nether, you travel eight blocks in the Overworld!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|ocean}} '''Ocean'''{{Collapse
|content=
Row, row, row your boat! 
Seriously, don't forget your boat! Oceans are vast expanses of water that can cover large swatches of the Minecraft world.

Covered in seagrass and kelp, the seafloor is mostly made up of gravel, although some clay, dirt, and sand patches will generate in shallow water. The seafloor can be fairly hilly, featuring multiple peaks, valleys, and ravines.

If a peak extends above sea level, it forms an island!

Aquatic mobs, such as drowned, fish, squid, and dolphins, frequently spawn within ocean biomes.
}}
{{EnvSprite|outer islands}} '''Outer Islands'''{{Collapse
|content=
As with the rest of the End, the outer islands are made entirely from endstone. Endermen also spawn throughout the outer islands. The outer islands of the End are broken down into multiple smaller biomes: end midlands, end highlands, small end islands and end barrens.

End cities, chorus plants, and end gateway portals generate in the end midlands and highlands biomes. These two biomes are also the only places where shulkers generate.

The small end islands make up the mostly empty expanse that lies between larger islands. It is populated with smaller, circular islands.

The end barrens biome can be found on the rims of larger islands. This biome has steep cliffs that drop into the void. Watch your step!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Savanna}} '''Savanna'''{{Collapse
|content=
Savannas are common dry and warm biomes that typically generate bordering deserts and plains. As savannas have a warm climate, it will never rain in one!

These relatively flat biomes are the only biomes where acacia trees generate naturally.
Appropriately, the villages that generate in savannas are built from acacia logs and planks. Although they are less common, oak trees can also be found in savannas.

Aside from mountains, savannas are the only biomes where llamas will spawn. As horses also spawn in savannas, this makes savannas the only biome where both llamas and horses spawn!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Snowy Taiga}} '''Snowy Taiga'''{{Collapse
|content=
The snowy taiga biome is a mostly flat biome that is covered in large expanses of spruce trees and snow. Snowy taigas are part of the snowy biome family.

Snowy taigas are one of the few biomes where wolves will spawn. They are also one of the two biomes where you can find naturally generated igloos!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Snowy Plains}} '''Snowy Tundra'''{{Collapse
|content=
The snowy tundra biome is a flat and expansive biome that is covered in snow.

Snowy tundras are part of the snowy biome family. They are one of the two biomes where igloos are naturally generated.

Very few trees are generated in snowy tundras, making it difficult to acquire wood, and all water sources that are exposed to the sky freeze over time.

Other than rabbits and polar bears, no passive mobs are able to spawn. However, strays are able to spawn at night.

Due to all of these harsh conditions, initial survival in snowy tundra biomes provide more of a challenge compared to other biomes!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|Swamp}} '''Swamp'''{{Collapse
|content=
What are you doing in my swamp?!
Characterized by a mix of flat, dry areas and shallow pools of grey-green water with floating lily pads, swamps are a part of the temperate and lush biome family.

As the water is so shallow, clay can be found abundantly. Mushrooms can also be found growing beneath the vine-covered trees.

While there are no ogres in these swamps, slimes will spawn naturally within swamp biomes. As slimes spawn even more commonly during full moons and drowned are capable of spawning underwater, swamps become very dangerous at night!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|taiga}} '''Taiga'''{{Collapse
|content=
The taiga biome is a mostly flat, but slightly hilly, cold biome covered in a forest of spruce trees.

Villages are able to generate in taiga biomes, and the houses in these villages will be built from spruce wood. Wolves and rabbits can also spawn in this biome.

With an abundance of wood, mild terrain, and useful passive mobs, taigas are convenient biomes to live in - as long as you don't mind the cold!
}}
{{BiomeSprite|warm ocean}} '''Warm Ocean'''{{Collapse
|content=
Warm oceans are beautiful and colorful biomes, where coral reefs of various blue, pink, red, purple, and yellow coral generate naturally. If you take the time to explore, you will find schools of tropical fish and pufferfish swimming around!

Warm oceans have light green water. The ocean floor is covered in sand and sea grass. You can also find sea pickles scattered throughout the coral. Kelp does not generate in warm oceans.

Wamr oceans will never generate directly next to land. There will always be at least 32 blocks of a lukewarm ocean bordering it if it happens to generate near land!

If any underwater ruins are generated, they will be composed of sand instead of the stone that makes up the underwater ruins of cold ocean biomes.
}}

=== Mob Gardens ===

==== Passive Mobs ====
{{EntitySprite|mule}} '''Mule'''
{{Collapse|content=Mules are tamable mobs that can be ridden when tamed. Unlike horses and donkeys, mules do not spawn in the wild. They can only be spawned by cross-breeding a horse with a donkey.

Mules spawn with three assigned ‘equine stats’ for their health, maximum movement speed, and jump strength. When a mule foal is bred, it will be untamed. It will also inherit some of its parents’ stats! Mules cannot be bred with other mules

Like donkeys, tamed mules can be equipped with saddles and chests.

Feeding a mule will restore its health, speed up the growth of foals, and increase the temper of untamed mules. They can be fed sugar, wheat, apples, golden carrots, golden apples, and hay bales.

When killed, mules will drop 0-2 leather. If they were equipped with a chest or saddle, they will drop this equipment as well.}}


{{EntitySprite|pig}} '''Pig''' (by OinkWorks)

{{Collapse|content=Oink! Pigs are common passive mobs that spawn in the Overworld. Pigs will follow any player carrying a carrot, carrot on a stick, potato, or beetroot. Pigs can be bred with carrots, potatoes, and beetroot.

If you put a saddle on a pig, you can ride it and join it as it wanders randomly throughout the world! Aimless travel not your thing?

If you have a carrot on a stick, you can control where the saddled pig goes! Wait! What’s a zombie pigman doing in the overworld?

When struck by lightning or hit by a trident with the Channeling enchantment during a thunderstorm, pigs will turn into zombie pigmen!

When an adult pig is killed, it will drop 1-3 raw porkchop. If it is killed by fire damage,it will drop cooked porkchop instead of raw porkchop. If it was saddled, it will drop the saddle.}}


{{EntitySprite|salmon}} '''Salmon'''

{{Collapse|content=Salmon are common passive mobs found in oceans and rivers. Salmon appear underwater from Y level 12 to 32 in cold and frozen oceans, as well as their deep variants. Unlike other fish types, they will also spawn in normal and frozen rivers.

When killed, they will drop 1 raw salmon. There is a 5% chance that they will also drop 1 bone meal on Java Edition, or a 25% chance they will drop 1-2 bones on Bedrock and Legacy Console editions.

If you use a water bucket on a salmon, you can collect it and obtain a bucket of salmon. Salmon collected and placed with buckets will not despawn naturally. Salmon, like other fish, cannot survive out of water.

They will flop around on their side before they suffocate to death.

<nowiki>:</nowiki>(}}


{{EntitySprite|white-sheep}} '''Sheep''' (by WoolWorks)

{{Collapse|content=Baaa! Sheep are passive mobs that spawn on grass blocks in the Overworld. There is a majority of sheep are white, with an 81.836% chance of spawning. The light grey, grey, and black sheep each have a 5% chance of spawning.

Brown sheep are uncommon and have a 3% chance of spawning. The rarest of tall is the pink sheep which only have a 0.164% chance of spawning!

When you use shears on an adult sheep, it will yield 1-3 wool. Sheep can be dyed any of the 16 dye colours, and sheared wool will match the colour of the sheep.

Sheep can be bred with wheat. If the parents have compatible wool colours that can be combined into a third dye colour, the resulting lamb will be a mix of their colours.

If not, the lamb will be the same colour as one of the two parents.

A regular sheep too boring for you? By naming a sheep “jeb_”, you will turn it into a rainbow sheep with wool that cycles smoothly through the different colours!

Alas, this is only a visual effect and it will drop its actual wool colour if sheared or killed. When killed, a sheep will drop one wool matching its colours if it has not already been sheared.

It will also drop 1-2 pieces of raw mutton. If it is killed by fire damage, it will drop cooked mutton instead of raw mutton.}}


{{EntitySprite|squid}} '''Squid'''

{{Collapse|content=Squid are common passive mobs that spawn in water between Y level 46 and sea level. When the world is generated, they can be found in any biome. Afterwards, however, they will only spawn in rivers, beach variants, and ocean biomes.

When killed, a squid will drop 1x3 ink sacs. Squid cannot survive out of water.

If they find themselves on land, they will eventually suffocate to death. If they are attacked, squid will release a cloud of black ink and swim away rapidly in the opposite direction.

Guardians will also attack and kill squid. Strange Fact: in the Java Edition Beta, it was possible to milk a squid and obtain a bucket of milk! Alas, this is no longer possible. #SquidMilk}}


{{EntitySprite|tropical-fish}} '''Tropical Fish'''

{{Collapse|content=Just keep swimming! Tropical fish are common passive mobs found in oceans. Tropical fish spawn in lukewarm, warm, and deep lukewarm oceans from Y level 12 to 32. In Bedrock Edition, they only spawn in oceans from Y biomes.

With a whopping 3,584 different variants of tropical fish, there are far too many to list! When killed, they will drop 1 raw tropical fish. Regardless of the tropical fish killed, they will drop item will always appear as a clownfish.

There is a 5% chance that they will also drop 1 bone meal on Java Edition, or a 25% chance they will drop 1-2 bones on Bedrock and Legacy Console editions.

If you use a water bucket on a tropical fish, you can collect it and obtain a bucket of tropical fish. If you take a closer look at these buckets, you’ll see that each tropical fish has a name!

Tropical fish collected and placed with buckets will not respawn naturally. Tropical fish, like other fish, cannot survive out of water. They will flop around on their side before they suffocate to death.}}{{EntitySprite|turtle}} '''Turtle'''
{{Collapse|content=Turtles are common mobs that can survive both on land and in water. They typically spawn in the Overworld on beaches, but not in snowy variants or on stone shores.

Turtles will follow a player holding seagrass. If two turtles are fed seagrass, they will enter love mode. One of the turtles will hold an egg in its inventory and make its way back to its home beach.

A turtle’s home beach is where it originally hatched or spawned. Once it returns, home, it will find a sand block to lay 1-4 eggs on. Turtle eggs will undergo three stages before they hatch into baby turtles.

Baby turtles can only hatch at night if their eggs are on the sand. If you were to use a Silk Touch tool on turtle eggs, you can relocate the turtle eggs and effectively set their home beach wherever you want!

When a baby turtle grows up into its adult form, it drops one scute.

When killed, an adult turtle will drop 0-2 pieces of seagrass.}}{{EntitySprite|Bat}} '''Bats'''{{Collapse
|content=
Na na na na na na na na na! Bats are flying mobs that spawn in caves. With their little squeaks, they add atmosphere to caves. When they are killed, they do not drop any items or experience.
}}

==== Neutral Mobs ====

==== Hostile Mobs ====
{{EntitySprite|Creeper}} '''Creeper'''{{Collapse
|content=
Ssssssssssss... Ah, the dreaded sound of a creeper hissing behind you! True to their namesake, creepers will silently creep up on unsuspecting players before hissing and exploding.

Naturally spawning in the Overworld, these iconic mobs drop 0-2 [[gunpowder]] when killed. However, if a crepeer is killed by a skeleton or stray, it will drop a random music disc!

If a creeper is struck by lightning, it becomes charged, amplifying its explosion power!
}}

=== The Museum of Redstone ===
{{BlockSprite|redstone-dust-t-left}} '''AND Gate'''{{Collapse
|content=
AND Gate.

Once you've mastered the basics you can build some pretty crazy contraptions with redstone! This is an example of an AND gate.

To power the lamp, both levers need to be turned on at the same time. This particular logic gate has been used a lot behind the scenes to power this puzzle!
}}
{{BlockSprite|Stone button}} '''Buttons'''{{Collapse
|content=
Buttons.

Everyone loves to press a good button. Pressing a button in Minecraft will only output a redstone signal for a short period of time however wooden button can be activated for longer periods by shooting an arrow at them. Take a shot!
}}
{{BlockSprite|redstone comparator}} '''Comparator 1'''{{Collapse
|content=
Comparator Inventory Detection.

A comparator placed next to a block with an inventory (such as a chest or hopper) will output a signal based on how full the inventory is.

Fill up this chest with enough items to turn on the lamp.
}}
{{BlockSprite|redstone comparator on}} '''Comparator 2'''{{Collapse
|content=
Hopper inventory fullness detection.

Here we have a hopper and a comparator detecting how full it is. There's also a bit of redstone logic thrown in there, but don't worry too much about that.

The comparator is detecting how full the hopper is so you need to add some items to create an output. Not enough items and the signal will be too weak, too many items and the signal will go too far and disable the redstone clock.

Try and work out the right amount of items to put into the hopper.

Hint: if in doubt, try half. Always go halfsies.
}}
{{BlockSprite|redstone comparator off}} '''Comparator 3'''{{Collapse
|content=
Normal comparator.

A comparator can look into block inventories using the input on its back (back input), but it also has an input on the side (side input).

The comparator will compare the two - if the side input is more powerful than the back input, then the comparator will not output anything. If it is as or less powerful than the back input, it will output a signal of the same strength as the back input.
}}
{{BlockSprite|redstone comparator}} '''Comparator 4'''{{Collapse
|content=
Comparator in subtract mode.

Check out the normal comparator device before giving this one a go!

Comparators have a clever little thing called 'subtract mode'.

In subtract mode the comparator takes the signal going in the back (closest to the redstone block) and subtracts the value of the redstone signal going in the side.

One of the levers will give the subtract comparator just enough power so that the redstone signal will travel the exact distance it needs to!
}}
{{BlockSprite|detector rail on}} '''Detector Rails'''{{Collapse
|content=
Detector Rails.

Detector rails are minecart rails which can detect if something is on top of them, essential for epic roller-coaster building! You might have noticed them in the tunnel that you first travelled through to get here.
}}
{{BlockSprite|lever}} '''Lever'''{{Collapse
|content=
One of the simplest redstone devices, levers are a redstone power source that you can turn 'on' or 'off'.
}}
{{BlockSprite|daylight detector}} '''Light Detector'''{{Collapse
|content=
Daylight detectors.

Daylight detectors detect the brightness of the sun and will output a signal based on this brightness.

They can be connected to a redstone lamp, and with some clever tinkering they can be made to turn on the lamp automatically at night, and turn it off during the morning - it's always good to save energy!
}}
{{BlockSprite|redstone repeater}} '''Locking Repeater'''{{Collapse
|content=
Locking repeater.

Repeaters are handy little blocks which can delay a signal for an amount of time, but they can also be used to 'lock' signals in one state. If you power one repeater with another from the side, that repeater will become 'locked', and

remember the input it had before it was 'locked'. You can then change the back input, and the output from the repeater will not change.

This machine has one repeater pointing into the side of another, which can therefore be locked. To power the lamp you will need the output from this repeater to be off, whilst keeping the lever from its back input to stay on.

If you do this in the correct order, the repeater will be locked whilst in its off state, and the lamp will turn on!
}}
{{BlockSprite|pressure plates}} '''Pressure Plates'''{{Collapse
|content=
Pressure plates.

Minecraft has a few different types of pressure plates. Wood and stone pressure plates will emit a full signal with any item, player or creature is on them.

'Weighted' pressure plates will output a signal based on the number of items or creatures on them. These come in two types, 'light' and 'heavy'.

Heavy weighted pressure plates (iron) require more items or creatures than light weighted pressure plates (gold) to output the same strength signal.
}}
{{ItemSprite|Chain boots}} '''Redstone Cannon'''{{Collapse
|content=
No wonder this dangerous contraption has been moved into the museum attic...

It still works, but make sure you grab a pair of special boots before giving it a try!
}}
{{EntitySprite|Sheep}} '''Redstone Grove'''{{Collapse
|content=
The magical trees of Redstone Grove. 
Sway and blow in the voltaic breeze. 
Alas the sheep that there did graze,
Did then absorb too many electrical rays!
}}
{{BlockSprite|Redstone torch}} '''Redstone Torch'''{{Collapse
|content=
Redstone Torch.

A redstone torch can be used to activate redstone devices but it also can be used to invert a redstone signal. If the block it is placed on is powered it will turn off and if it is unpowered it will turn on.
}}
{{BlockSprite|Slime Block}} '''Slime Blocks'''{{Collapse
|content=
Slime blocks.

Sticky pistons can push and pull one block connected to it. When a slime block is connected to a piston, it will also push and block any block connected to it (except obsidian and bedrock).

Flick the levers at the base of the three pistons to make the redstone signal flow through the device and reach the redstone lamp. You may want to jump on top of the device to get a better view!
}}
{{BlockSprite|Piston side left}} '''T Flip-Flop 1'''{{Collapse
|content=
Toggle Flip-Flop.

This may sound like some beach-appropriate footwear, but this is a serious piece of electronic equipment so stop dreaming about sand, sea and sunshine and listen up!

This device works like a lever, switching from an on-state to an off-state with a simple pulse input. Although it works like a lever, it is activated with a button input. Pressing the button will switch it between on and off.
}}
{{BlockSprite|Piston side right}} '''T Flip-Flop 2'''{{Collapse
|content=
Chained Toggle Flip-Flop.

Now we're getting fancy. Try fixing the toggle flip device if you have not already before attempting this!

This device is three 'toggle flip-flops' connected together with one button input. Each one will scroll through the combinations of the next one giving a total of 8 ways to light the lamps.

Only one of those combinations will light up all three lamps, which is what you need to do!
}}
{{BlockSprite|Piston}} '''T Flip-Flop'''{{More info}}{{Collapse
|content=
This Toggle Flip-Flop design is much more complex than the Java version.

There is a quirk of Java redstone that does not exist in the Bedrock edition (this version) which means that the Java design is unpredictable.

Thanks to /u/PC_Screen for your Reddit post that pointed me in the right direction of observers which solves this issue.
}}
{{BlockSprite|Tripwire hook}} '''Tripwire'''{{Collapse
|content=
Tripwire.

A tripwire works like a pressure plate except it is very hard to notice. They can be used to make traps and are used in jungle temples. You can trick this particular trap by placing an item on it!

== Trivia ==
* Players in the world are permanently affected by [[Speed]] II, presumably to help them traverse the large map.
* The Vault's code: 170509, is based off Minecraft's original release date: May 17, 2009.
* The [[Update Aquatic]] is erroneously referred to as the "Aquatic Update," a common mistake.
** Similarly, the [[horse update]] is referred to as the "horses update."
* In the Vault, chests belonging to [[liquid]] blocks are placed within the floor.
* Surrounding the map, every [[splash text]] up to that point is engraved on the floor.
* Many of the descriptive books make references to pop culture, such as the entry on bats beginning on a nod to the theme song of the 1966 [[w:Batman (TV series)|Batman]] television series, and the swamp book containing the line "what are you doing in my swamp," a line associated with the character [[Shrek]].
** Both of those properties would later receive official collaborations with Minecraft, in the form of the [[Batman (world)|Batman]] map and the [[Universal Studios Event]].
