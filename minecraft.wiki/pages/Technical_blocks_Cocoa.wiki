|{{HistoryLine||v0.9.0|dev=build 1|Cocoa has an extra, unobtainable item form corresponding to its block ID, which uses the fully grown texture. It can be obtained via inventory editors with numeric item ID 127.
|The cocoa item always places age 0 cocoa regardless of the item's damage value. The cocoa is placed with its stem attached to the south if the player does not place it on the side of a block.}}

|{{HistoryLine||?|Attempting to place a cocoa item in an invalid space does not consume the cocoa, even in survival; however, cocoa beans are dropped at that location.<ref>https://youtu.be/2UUX5gJdf2A?t=9m24s</ref> It renders for a frame if placed on a non-jungle log, and is consumed if replacing an existing replaceable block such as grass.}}
