{{Missing information|Creative Inventory specific additions and removals of blocks and items:
*All changes on New Nintendo 3DS Edition
*Some blocks and items in older Minecraft versions were initially added only obtainable in Survival mode or by commands only; and in a later, different update; added to the Creative inventory. List those blocks/items, and their updates/snapshots; that they got added to the Creative inventory. Currently: Java Beta 1.8+, Bedrock MCPE alpha 0.1.0+, Legacy Console TU5+, they are precise only to major updates. Need specific snapshot info for all items listed. There might be info on a block/item or two that might be missing.<!--Exclusive or removed features, list them here-->
*List all changes to the item categorization in Creative inventory tabs. (Mostly complete, might have missed one or two things, need specific snapshots.)
*List changes to Creative Inventory sort order for ''Bedrock Edition'' before Bedrock 1.2.10, and ''Java Edition'' before 12w21b and after 17w47a. Double check Legacy Console Edition, may have missed a few things.<!--Only list minor changes, major changes just specify "major change"; list bug fixes. All changes on Legacy Console were minor adjustments, so Legacy Console can be described in full.-->
*The tables have been split into Creative inventory specific additions/arrangements and general inventory changes, please make sure the tables are split accordingly.}}
