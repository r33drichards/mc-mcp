'''Bee nests''' are [[block]]s found attached to certain [[tree]]s. They house [[bee]]s, which fill their homes with honey made from gathered [[flower]] nectar. Full bee nests can be harvested for [[honeycomb]]s (using [[shears]]) or [[honey bottle]]s (using [[glass bottle]]s). Bees will attack [[player]]s who harvest or break their homes without utilizing [[campfire]]s or [[Silk Touch]], respectively.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Tutorial:Honey farming#Avoiding bee anger}}
Bee nests can be broken by any [[tool]] or by the [[player]]'s fist, though they break faster with an [[axe]]. 

If a bee nest is broken with a tool not enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], it drops nothing and any bees inside [[Bee#Attacking|emerge angry at the player]], attempting to sting them, which causes [[Poison]] on success. Nearby bees will also become angry and attack. If a Silk Touch tool is used, the bee nest drops itself and any bees inside remain inside, and any bees nearby do not become angry. 

If broken in [[Creative]] mode with bees inside, the bee nest drops itself and bees inside remain inside.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Bee nest in superflat village.png|thumb|A naturally generated bee nest in a [[village]] in a [[Superflat]] world.]]
Naturally generated bee nests generate with 2-3 bees in them, and always face south.

Bee nests generate in the following biomes with different chances:

=== Post-generation ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], or [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks (including diagonally) of a [[flower]] on the same Y-level have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 2–3 [[bee]]s. This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including [[wither rose]]s and [[flowering azalea]]s.

[[Mangrove]]s grown from [[mangrove propagule]]s have a 1% chance of having a bee nest containing 2-3 bees. Unlike birch, cherry and oak trees, no flowers are required for a bee nest to generate.<ref>{{bug|MC-249937||Propagules grown without a flower nearby can generate bee nests in the mangrove tree|WAI}}</ref>

In [[Bedrock Edition]], oak trees grown in plains have a chance to grow with a bee nest regardless of the quantity of flowers nearby. It is not known if this behavior is intended.
