'''On Fire!''' is a tiered reward system mechanic within ''[[Minecraft Blast]]'' where players are required to beat levels consecutively to get extra boosters at the start of a level. The rewards depend on how many consecutive levels the player has completed (maxing out at 3), and will reset if the player loses or quits a level. Each tier gives the player a specific number of boosters, ranging from rockets to end crystals.
