A '''grove''' is a snowy forest biome that often generates on the sides of [[mountains]]. Similar to the [[snowy taiga]], it is filled with [[spruce trees]] but the ground is covered with [[snow block]]s and occasional [[powder snow]] patches.

== Description ==
A grove creates a forest of spruce [[tree]]s on the sides of a mountain, reminiscent of a [[snowy taiga]] but the surface is covered [[snow blocks]] above a [[dirt]] ground, with [[snow]] layers on top. All spruce trees grow on a single block of dirt replacing snow blocks, with a slightly lower density than in snowy taigas. [[Strip|Strips]] of [[powder snow]] occasionally replace snow blocks and the dirt below, where trees do not generate. [[Fallen trees]] and [[Dying tree|dying trees]] do not generate here. [[Rabbit]]s, snowy [[wolves]] and snow [[foxes]] can spawn in this biome. Like other mountain biomes, [[Emerald Ore|emerald ore]] and [[infested stone]] can generate in stone under the ground. [[Pillager outposts]] are the only structures that generate here. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], groves use default environmental settings with a coolish color grading, making the biome appear colder blue. 

This biome generates next to [[Snowy Slopes|snowy slopes]] and [[Frozen Peaks|frozen]] and [[Jagged Peaks|jagged]] peaks in temperate or cold areas. On the valley side of a mountain, groves border forest biomes such as [[taigas]], [[Old Growth Taiga|old growth taigas]], [[Birch Forest|birch forests]], and [[Dark Forest|dark forests]], and they sometimes border [[meadows]] and [[cherry groves]] on plateaus. In snowy climate areas, groves can generate at lower elevations and consist of thousands of blocks in size, bordering [[Snowy Taiga|snowy taigas]] which can sometimes generate replacing frozen rivers in valleys. Because groves generate at low erosion values, they have a high chance of generating [[Deep Dark|deep dark]] below. In less mountainuous areas, [[Dripstone Caves|dripstone caves]] or [[Lush Caves|lush caves]] can also generate here. 

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
