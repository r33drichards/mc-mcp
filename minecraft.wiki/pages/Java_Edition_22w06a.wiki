'''22w06a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18.2]], released on February 9, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w06a|February 9, 2022}}</ref> which introduces compliance requirements for players in South Korea, added "Universal Tags", and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
[[File:Regional compliancies notification 1 hour.png|thumb|Notification of playing greater than 1 hour.]]
[[File:Regional compliancies notification 1 day.png|thumb|Notification of playing greater than 24 hours.]]

'''Compliance requirements'''
* Added gameplay timers and notices in compliance with gaming laws in South Korea, in order to help remind these players to take occasional breaks from gameplay.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* Added a JSON file related to the new compliance requirements, located at <samp>assets/[namespace]/regional_compliancies.json</samp>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Tags can now be defined for any types in registry, rather than only blocks, items, fluids, entity types, game events and functions previously.
** In datapacks, tags of new types are stored in their own folders (but not present in the vanilla datapack currently). The folders' names are based on their names in the <samp>registries.json</samp>, for example:
*** Tags for potions: <samp>/data/[namespace]/tags/potion</samp>
*** Tags for biomes: <samp>/data/[namespace]/tags/worldgen/biome</samp>
** For tags of blocks, items, fluids, entity types, game events and functions, their locations in datapacks are currently not changed, even if they use plural names which is against the new name format.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[Custom world generation]]'''
* Some fields in worldgen structures that previously only lists of element IDs now accept tags.
** Those entries now accept <code>[id, ...]</code>, <code>id</code> (shortcut for <code>[id]</code>) and <code>#tag</code>.
** Changed fields are:
*** <code>feature.glow_lichen</code> configuration: <code>can_be_placed_on</code>
*** <code>feature.spring_feature</code> configuration: <code>valid_blocks</code>
*** <code>feature.simple_random_selector</code> configuration: <code>features</code>
*** <code>block_predicate_type.matching_blocks</code>: <code>blocks</code>
*** <code>block_predicate_type.matching_fluids</code>: <code>fluids</code>
*** <code>biome</code>: inner list in <code>features</code>, map value in <code>carvers</code>
*** <code>biome_source.checkerboard</code>: <code>biomes</code>
* Some tag fields now require id to be prepended with <code>#</code>, however they are not yet accepting element list:
** <code>dimension_type</code>: <code>infiniburn</code>
** <code>feature.geode</code> configuration: <code>blocks.cannot_replace</code>, <code>blocks.invalid_blocks</code>
** <code>feature.vegetation_patch</code>, <code>feature.waterlogged_vegetation_patch</code> configuration: <code>replaceable</code>
** <code>feature.root_system</code> configuration: <code>root_replaceable</code>
** <code>structure_processor.protected_blocks</code>: <code>value</code>
* Structure fields in noise settings no longer have separate subfields for strongholds and non-stronghold structures. Instead each structure has a tag field which is <code>tag</code>: <code>concentric_rings</code> for strongholds and <code>tag</code>: <code>random_spread</code> for non-stronghold structures.

'''[[Superflat]]'''
* Changed the "Water World" preset, by replacing [[sand]] with [[gravel]], and adding additional 64 layers of [[deepslate]] above the [[bedrock]] layer, in order to fix the [[ocean monument]] generation issue in worlds using this preset.
