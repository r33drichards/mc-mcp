The '''illusioner''' is an [[Java Edition unused features|unused]] [[illager]] armed with a [[bow]]. It attacks using illusions and can also fire [[arrow]]s.

== Spawning ==
Illusioners do not spawn naturally, nor do they have a [[spawn egg]] in the [[Creative inventory]]. An illusioner can be [[Mob spawning#Other types of spawning|spawned]] only using [[data pack]]s or the {{cmd|summon minecraft:illusioner}} in-game [[command]]. Illusioners do not spawn in [[woodland mansion]]s or [[pillager outpost]]s, nor at [[raid]]s or [[patrol]]s. Similarly to the [[giant]], illusioners do not spawn in any [[biome]], [[monster spawner]], or [[world]]-generated [[structure]].

== Drops ==
When an illusioner is killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]], any [[Drops#Equipped items|naturally spawned equipment]], including its unenchanted [[bow]], has an 8.5% chance of dropping (or 9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) and drops with a random item [[durability]]. In addition, {{xp|5}} [[experience]] orbs are dropped on player or tamed wolf kills.

The illusioner also drops one illager [[ominous banner]] and one [[Ominous Bottle|ominous bottle]] if it is a [[raid captain]].

== Behavior ==
Although they do not naturally spawn in raids, illusioners spawned by the player attack [[player]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[iron golem]]s, and [[wandering trader]]s within a 16×4×16 cubic area. 

An illusioner joins a nearby raid if it occurs or joins a patrol if sufficiently near a [[patrol captain]]. 

The illusioner attacks with its spells and its bow, firing an arrow every second, three times faster than a [[skeleton]]. Unless the illusioner is summoned using [[command]]s, it cannot attack with a non-bow item in its hand, cannot use [[tipped arrow]]s in its offhand slot (but can use [[spectral arrow]]s) and cannot use enchanted bows. Also, it is the only illager that can see its target through walls. 

The Illusioner moves quickly on a semi-circular fashion and always tries to maintain a consistent distance between itself and the player, strafing from left to right and vice-versa, retreating if the player gets too close or advancing if the player retreats. 

Finally, the illusioner has two spells: a spell that blinds its opponent and a spell that summons visual pseudo-duplicates and makes the illusioner invisible.

If it has no bow, the illusioner becomes "passive". An unarmed illusioner can be spawned with the command {{cmd|/summon minecraft:illusioner ~ ~ ~ {} }}.

=== Casting Blindness ===
[[File:Illusioner Blindness.gif|thumb|200px|An illusioner casting blindness.]]

The illusioner casts its blindness spell only if the [[regional difficulty]] is greater than 2. As a result, the world difficulty [[options|setting]], the inhabited time of the [[chunk]], the total daytime in the world and the phase of the moon from the day-night cycle affects its ability.

This spell gives a [[Blindness]] effect that lasts for 20 seconds upon first engaging a new player opponent. The illusioner signals this attack by raising its arms during a short-timed animation, making a low pitched sound and producing a black mist of [[particles]] ({{EffectSprite|particle-illusioner-blindness}}). Other entities (typically a wolf, a [[snow golem]] or an [[iron golem]]) do not trigger this magic. The illusioner does not cast this spell more than once on the same player opponent, unless it has first shifted its attention to another opponent and then back to that original opponent. 

This spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to <abbr title="20 ticks">1 second</abbr> and resets the cooldown for the blinding spell to <abbr title="180 ticks">9 seconds</abbr>.

=== Summoning duplicates ===
[[File:IllusionerDuplicates.png|thumb|200px|An illusioner's four false duplicates. The real illusioner is invisible.]]
As long as an illusioner is engaged in [[combat]], it casts an [[Invisibility]] status effect on itself that lasts 60 seconds and refreshes the effect whenever the Invisibility's time runs out. The illusioner signals this spell by raising its arms, making a strange high pitched sound and producing a blue mist of particles called "mirror".

When an illusioner becomes invisible through this or another method, it creates four false duplicates of itself. These hover and waver at short distances from the actually invisible illusioner, though they do not space themselves out until the first time the illusioner is attacked. They face in exactly the same direction as the illusioner and move somewhat in step with the original, appearing to no-clip through [[block]]s like a [[vex]] does. Despite using the shooting animation whenever the original uses its bow, only the real illusioner can shoot and be damaged.

The clones move to new positions if they were not triggered and are still bunched together. The illusioner can also do this once in a while to "refresh" the clones' positions.

When the real illusioner is damaged, its duplicates all snap back to where the real illusioner is, then quickly snap back out to new positions, making a teleporting sound, signaling the hit.

If an invisible illusioner receives the [[Glowing]] effect, all of the duplicates glow, while the true illusioner remains invisible. However, only the invisible illusioner burns when catching [[fire]].

The duplicates disappear once the illusioner's Invisibility effect ends.

This spell resets the illusioner's spell cooldown to <abbr title="20 ticks">1 second</abbr> and resets the cooldown for the invisibility spell to <abbr title="340 ticks">17 seconds</abbr>.

== Issues ==
Illusioners are an unsupported mob and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed.

{{Issue list|projects=MC}}

== Trivia ==
* The illusioner displace sound almost is the same as the traditional sound of teleportation via an [[ender pearl]] or [[chorus fruit]], [[endermen]] or [[shulker]]s, albeit with a slight distortion at the end.
* Illusioners shoot backward when they are in a [[boat]].<ref>{{bug|MC-137793}}</ref>
* Illusioners hold bows in a different direction compared to [[skeleton]]s or players, a little more diagonally.
* Despite being unused, the illusioner was present in a ''[[Minecraft]]'' video about every mob in the game.<ref>{{ytl|SyP5Urfk9cQ|Which mobs did we miss?|Minecraft|January 19, 2024|t=38s}}</ref>
** As a result of being unused, an episode of [[The Story of Mobs]] gave instructions on how to spawn it to give context for what the mob is.<ref>{{YouTube link|BkbE7jf--2s|Easter Eggs Behind The...Sick Villagers? {{!}} The Story of the Illagers|Minecraft|October 27, 2024}}</ref>
*Illusioners displace spell can be triggered by splashing them with a splash potion of invisibility.
