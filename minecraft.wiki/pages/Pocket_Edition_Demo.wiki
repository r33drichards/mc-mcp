* [[Vegetation|Flower and Mushroom patches]]

=== General ===
* Inventory hotbar had a smaller look and contained 8 item slots, with a 9th functioning as an [[inventory]] button.
* Blocks in the item form use their own block texture (if there are several, then side texture).

== Older version ==
An older version of the Demo is known to exist.<ref name=":0" /> This version has a few differences from the version showcased at E3 2011.

Known differences from the version showcased at E3:

* This version lacks an inventory button, instead a [[block of iron]] is in the 8th slot, with the [[ladder]] on the 9th slot instead of the 8th slot.
* When the crosshair is facing a block in this version, a white overlay is not shown.
* The [[water]] texture appears to be different from the version showcased at E3, however this might just be due to hardware.

== Trivia  ==
* The inventory and hotbar block icons were seen in 2D instead of 3D.
* The rose was going to be identical to [[Java Edition|Java]]'s rose, but was replaced with a cyan texture because of hardware issues.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|78539168938078208|@Michaeldz360 The cyan flowers was an attempt to get rid of a hardware-related problem. We don't plan to add them to the PC version|June 9th, 2011}}</ref> Using the red rose texture on an Xperia Play device causes noticeable ghosting of red pixels.
*The first internal version only had an ASCII renderer.<ref>{{Mcnet|pocket-edition-5-years-old|Pocket Edition is 5 years old!|December 2, 2016|Marsh Davies}}</ref>
