'''21w37a''' is the first non-experimental [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on September 15, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w37a|September 15, 2021}}</ref> which adds the contents of the previous seven experimental snapshots and brings more parity with {{BE}}.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Commands]]'''
* {{cmd|jfr}}
** When enabled, begins profiling with Java FlightRecorder, as well as the following custom events:
*** '''minecraft.ServerTickTime''': Sampling event exposing average server tick times in intervals of a second
*** '''minecraft.ChunkGeneration''': Time taken to generate individual chunk stages
*** '''minecraft.PacketRead''' / '''minecraft.PacketSent''': Network traffic
*** '''minecraft.WorldLoadFinishedEvent''': Initial world loading duration
** The profiling can be stopped in-game by using {{cmd|jfr stop}}.

'''Font'''
* Added <code>illageralt</code>, the rune-like font from ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]''.
** Currently only usable via commands

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added the <code>type</code> field, which is mandatory.
** Written into <code>BlockEntityTag.id</code> to ensure that the tag can be migrated correctly between versions.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Can now disable [[lightning]] flashes, which prevents lightning from making the sky flash. Lightning bolts themselves still appear.
* The device the game outputs audio to can now be chosen in-game.
* Added "Priority updates" to video settings.
** Determines as to which chunk sections are updated synchronously in a single frame.
** Three options:
*** '''nearby''', which corresponds to how chunk sections were updated before 21w37a, '''by player''' and '''none''', which reduce stuttering when placing or removing blocks.
*** However, the latter two options may cause rare visual delays in world updates. These options also appear to be improperly capitalized.<ref>{{Bug|MC-236615}}</ref> 

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Added subtitles for various [[bundle]] sounds.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Enchanting table]]'''
* Now emits a light level of 7.

'''[[Cave vines]], [[kelp]], [[twisting vines]] and [[weeping vines]]'''
* Now stop growing if [[shears]] are used on the tip.
** This action changes the <code>age</code> block state of the tip to 25.

'''[[Snow block]]'''
* Reverted change allowing plants to be placed on snow blocks.
** This reversion results in the lack of vegetation in the grove biome.

=== Items ===
'''[[Bundle]]'''
* Has been removed from the creative inventory once again.
* Can once again no longer be crafted.
* Only accessible through commands once again.

'''[[Crossbow]]'''
* Durability has been increased to 465.

'''[[Elytra]]'''
* Reverted changes from [[Java Edition 1.18 experimental snapshot 7|experimental snapshot 7]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Axolotl]]s'''
* Now have their own mob cap.
* Now avoid lava.

'''[[Vindicator]]s, [[pillager]]s, and [[evoker]]s'''
* Don't attack baby [[villager]]s anymore.

'''[[Goat]]s'''
* Now only spawn in [[snowy slopes]], [[stony peaks]], [[lofty peaks]], and [[snow capped peaks]] biomes.

'''[[Rabbits]]'''
* Can now spawn on [[snow block]]s.

'''Feedable mobs'''
* All feedable mobs (except sheep) named "Dinnerbone" now look at the player correctly.

'''General'''
* Reverted changes of [[Monster Spawner|spawner]]s from [[Java Edition 1.18 experimental snapshot 2|experimental snapshot 2]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Stone shore]]s'''
* Changes of [[diorite]], [[andesite]], or [[granite]] generated as strips in [[Java Edition 1.18 experimental snapshot 4|experimental snapshot 4]] is reverted.

'''[[Stony peaks]]'''
* Changes of andesite, granite and [[gravel]] generated as strips in experimental 4 is reverted.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Version number has been increased to 8.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Sneak, sprint, and auto-jump options have been moved to the "Controls" menu.
* Render distance now causes chunks to load in a cylinder shape around the player instead of a square.

'''[[Scoreboard]]s'''
* Removed length limits for scoreboards, score holders and team names.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* The splash "[this splash text has been delayed until part 2]" has been changed to "[this splash text is now available]".

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Renamed the <code>lava_pool_stone_replaceables</code> block tag to <code>lava_pool_stone_cannot_replace</code>.

'''Other'''
* Worlds last opened before [[Java Edition 1.2]] can no longer be opened.
** These worlds must be opened in a version prior to 21w37a (preferably between [[Java Edition 1.2]] and [[Java Edition 1.6.4]]).
** An error is shown when attempting to open these worlds.
