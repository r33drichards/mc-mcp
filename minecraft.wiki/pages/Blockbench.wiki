'''Blockbench''' is a free and {{w|open source}} 3D-modeling application, designed for creating low-polygon models. Its development is supported by [[Mojang Studios]], who use the application internally for model and asset animation.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/blockbench/faq/|title=Blockbench FAQ|website=Blockbench Wiki}}</ref> It is also recommended as tool for model editing in the {{BE}} creator documentation.<ref>{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/blockbench?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Getting Started with Blockbench|website=Microsoft Learn|date=November 21, 2024}}</ref> Mojang Studios also provides official plugins for the software &ndash; namely the Minecraft Block Wizard, Minecraft Entity Wizard and Minecraft Item Wizard &ndash; to help creators with [[add-on]] development. It is also commonly used to make item models on {{JE}}.

== Features ==
{{Work in progress}}
Blockbench allows users to make custom models, as well as text in the style of the logo text on the [[Title Screen]] (with the help of a plugin), among other things. One can change their current model's appearance by changing its composition of [[w:Voxel|voxels]], and the texture file that maps onto them.

While it originally exclusively supported models that were only made of cuboids, more versions allow it to support and edit [[w:Polygon mesh|meshes]], [[w:Spline (mathematics)|splines]], [[w:2.5D#Billboarding|billboard sprites]], and [[w:Armature (computer animation)|armatures]].
