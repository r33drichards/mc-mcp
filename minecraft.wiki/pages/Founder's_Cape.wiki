The '''Founder's Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was released for download during [[MINECON Live 2019]], being the first cape to be released to the [[Character Creator]].

== Appearance ==
The cape is an orange colorization of the [[MINECON 2011 Cape]] depicting a creeper face. A gradient from light at the bottom to darker at the top appears which is paired with a hood.

== Distribution ==
Players were able to obtain [[Founder's Cape (skin pack)|the Founder's cape skin pack]] through the [[Marketplace]] for a limited time for free. With the skin pack, only [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] could use the cape. Players who previously claimed the skin pack received the cape as Character Creator item when the Character Creator was released. It is no longer available in the Marketplace.
