'''Mod armor''' is an [[item]] exclusive to ''[[China Edition]]'', used for [[add-on]] development, which has now become obsolete.

== Obtaining ==
The [[item]] can be obtained through the use of addons and modifying NBT data, but cannot be obtained through the {{cmd|give}} [[command]].

== Usage ==
In the early versions of ''[[China Edition]]'', <samp>mod_armor</samp> was used for custom equipment and an item frame that allows customization and modification of equipment settings (only for the equipment slot area).

When worn, <samp>mod_armor</samp> provided {{armor|2}} armor points. The item was not worn on the head, but on the feet. It had 0 armor toughness by default.

The item used the old [[golden_helmet]] texture and did not have an accurate name (the name was "<samp>item.mod_armor.name</samp>").
