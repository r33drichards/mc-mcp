{{debug warning|plural=1}}
'''Debug properties''' or '''debug flags''' are JVM properties that enable various debug features in the game.

== Usage ==
To enable debug features, JVM properties must be set when launching the game. To enable any feature, the global flag {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED}} must be set. Then a specific feature can be enabled using {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_{{ph|name}}}} or {{cd|1=-DMC_DEBUG_{{ph|name}}={{ph|value}}}} flag.
