'''Beta 1.21.120.25''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.120.25''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the sixth and final beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.120]],<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/40147803190669-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-120-25|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.120.25|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=October 7, 2025}}</ref> released on October 7, 2025, which adds Realms Saves and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Realms]]'''
[[File:Manage Realms Screen Menu "Saves" Tab Settings (Bedrock Preview 1.21.120.25).png|thumb|The new Realms saves settings screen.]]
* The backups system has been replaced with a general "Saves" system. There are two types of Realms saves:
** Automatic saves are functionally the same as the previous backups system:
*** They are taken at the end of every Realms play session when the server shuts down, or every 30 minutes during a play session.
*** They are only retained for a limited time, according to the retention policy (which has not changed with this update).
*** They do not count towards the bank of cloud storage.
*** They are on by default and can't be turned off.
*** All previous Realms backups will be converted to automatic saves.
** Manual saves are created by the Realm owner and count towards a bank of storage that comes with the Realms subscription.
*** Manual saves are retained as long as the Realm exists. They are not automatically deleted by the retention policy, but Realm owners can delete manual saves if they want to free up storage space.
*** Realms Plus subscriptions come with 10GB of manual save storage and Realms Core subscriptions come with 5GB.
*** Automatic saves can be turned into manual saves by the Realm owner.
** Realms saves can be found in the Realms settings menu accessed via the "Edit Realm" button rather than the Realms world settings menu that backups used to show up in. While playing on the Realm, saves can also be found in the in-game settings menu for the Realm owner.
** Realms saves will also now list the world name and the packs that were applied at the time of the save.
