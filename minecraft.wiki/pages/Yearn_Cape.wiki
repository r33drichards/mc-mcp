The '''Yearn Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out as a promotion for ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', alongside the [[Home Cape]] and the [[Menace Cape]].

== Appearance ==
The cape's design depicts the mine entrance as shown in ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', with rails leading into the mine. The backside of the cape depicts a view into the outside world from within the mine.

The elytra design depicts the movie's version of {{AMCM|Steve}}, as portrayed by [[Jack Black]].

== Distribution ==

== Trivia ==
* "Idaho" is a codename used for Marketplace items related to {{AMCM}}.
* The name and design of the cape is a reference to a quote from the film, wherein Steve recounts his origin story of "yearning for the {{AMCM|mine}}s",<ref>{{YouTube link|wJO_vIDZn-I|A Minecraft Movie {{!}} Official Trailer|Warner Bros.|November 19, 2024}}</ref> which quickly turned into a meme before the movie had even been released.
** This was itself a reference to an internet meme that jokingly suggested Minecraft's popularity among children indicated their desire to partake in child labor.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-children-yearn-for-the-mines|title=The Children Yearn For The Mines|author=[https://knowyourmeme.com/users/owen Owen]|website=Know Your Meme}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|Froggenthusias1|1490752695044554756|Minecraft proves that abolishing child labour was a mistake.
