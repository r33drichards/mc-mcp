A '''heavy core''' is a rare [[block]] that can only be obtained from [[ominous vault]]s found in [[trial chambers]]. It can be combined with a [[breeze rod]] to craft a [[mace]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|heavy-core}}

=== Breaking ===
A heavy core can be mined with any tool or by hand, but a [[pickaxe]] is the most effective. It always drops itself when mined. 

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Heavy Core|Pickaxe}}

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Note blocks ===
Heavy cores can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce the "snare drum" sound.

=== Piston interactivity ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, just like [[glazed terracotta]], heavy cores can be pushed by [[piston]]s but can't be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s. They also don't stick to [[slime block]]s and [[honey block]]s. {{IN|java}}, they can be both pushed and pulled by pistons. They also stick to slime blocks and honey blocks.
