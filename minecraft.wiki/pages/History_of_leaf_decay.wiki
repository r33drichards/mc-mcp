This page documents ''[[Java Edition]]''&#8203;'s several historical [[Leaves|leaf]] decay algorithms.

== Indev ==
Leaves will ''not'' decay if:
* They are within a 5×5×2 box around a log with the log in the bottom center. (Note that the leaf does not have to touch the log)
* They are on top of a solid block.
* They are on top of a leaf that is unable to decay due to the reasons above.

If these conditions are not met, the leaf decays.

== Infdev and early Alpha ==
From [[Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1414|Infdev 20100227-1414]] to this version, leaves did not decay. Leaves stopped decaying again in [[Infdev 20100413]], due to the addition of large trees. This was reimplemented again in [[Infdev 20100615]]. It stayed this way until [[Alpha v1.0.6]].

== Alpha ==

In Alpha v1.0.6, leaves did not decay. This was changed the following version, [[Alpha v1.0.6_01]]. In [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]], leaves decayed using an algorithm that checks whether it has a [[legacy solid|solid]] or leaf block underneath it or is adjacent to a solid [[block]]. If it doesn't, it must be connected to a leaf block that is also supported as long as it is no further than five blocks away from said support.

In [[Alpha v1.2.0]], leaves stopped decaying, then began decaying again in [[Alpha v1.2.3]]. However, due to a bug that caused an infinite loop in the code, leaf decaying was removed in the next version, [[Alpha v1.2.3_01]].

== Beta ==
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.0]], leaves started decaying again. The code for decaying leaves was rewritten in [[Beta 1.1]]. From [[Beta 1.2]] to [[Beta 1.5]], birch and spruce leaves dropped [[oak saplings]], instead of their respective saplings. Since the [[Beta 1.8 Pre-release]], leaf blocks placed by players or [[endermen]] no longer started decaying.

== Release ==
The leaf decay mechanics have not changed substantially since 1.0. In [[Java Edition 1.13]], leaves were changed to only start decaying 6 blocks away from any log or wood block. Prior to this change, the distance is 4 blocks. This shorter distance is also still used {{In|Bedrock}}.
