A '''copper sword''' is a variant of [[sword]] crafted from [[copper ingot]]s. It is the fourth-highest [[tier]] of sword, dealing the same damage as a [[stone sword]] but having more durability.

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
A copper sword can be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using copper sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes [[bamboo]], despite that a copper sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.

If a copper sword is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], either using [[Creative]] or [[commands]], cobwebs the sword destroys drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual [[string]]. This is due to the sword being classified as the proper tool for [[Cobweb|cobwebs]].

==== Creative mode ====
In Creative mode, copper swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as [[minecart]]s, [[painting]]s, [[item frame]]s,{{only|java}} and [[armor stand]]s.

=== Attacking ===
A copper sword can also be used to deal [[damage]] to mobs and entities by {{control|attacking}} them. A copper sword has {{hp|6}} base damage {{in|be}}, and can be enchanted to deal more damage. The following tables show how the [[Sharpness]] enchantment affects the damage dealt by the sword.

A copper sword can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding units of the [[tiers]]' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% a copper sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two copper swords of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the sword's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A copper sword can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
