'''Minecraft Celebrates the Community! (Yes, that means you!)''' is a celebration of the ''[[Minecraft]]'' community, made to commemorate the game achieving one trillion views on the video sharing platform {{Wikipedia|YouTube}}.<ref>{{Mcnet|youtube-celebrates-minecraft-community|YouTube Celebrates the Minecraft Community|December 15, 2021|[[Sofia Dankis]]}}</ref>

== Summary ==
The video opens in "[[Java Edition Classic 0.0.11a|Minecraft build 0.0.11a]], 2009" as a classic [[player]] builds with [[dirt]] blocks. A time traveler emerges from the ground with a shovel, asking "which build is this?" The classic player simply says "one of the first," causing the time traveler to take them down into a hole and sky dive into "Minecraft build 1.1???, present day." The classic player asks if the strange land they encountered is a DLC, only to be surprised when they find out it's actually built by ''Minecraft'' YouTubers, which have now generated a trillion views. The classic player is then revealed to be so old that they don't know what [[Breaking|mining]] is, asking why people are digging a big hole.

The Classic Player continues, asking where people learn their skills, remarking they couldn't find a tutorial. The time traveler simply replies there "is no tutorial for this level of creativity." They walk past a [[redstone]] contraption and both remark that it's dangerous. A sea of [[arrows]] fall from the sky, forcing them to take cover, only to be affected by an antigravity mod. They then pass a [[Nether Portal]] under construction, which the time traveler refers to as being built by a hack. The two then uncover a griefer burning down a house, which the classic player is horrified by and asks for the legality of. The classic player asks why to do all of this, and the time traveler explains the monetary incentives of being a YouTuber.

After arriving at a [[beach]] and bumping into a disappearing [[horse]], the classic player asks if "this was all part of [[Mojang]]'s plan." They are told no in a condescending manner, before another time traveler voiced by [[Jeb|Jens Bergensten]] emerges from the [[sand]] to propose showing the two the future.

{{Collapse|content=[Time Traveler] What build is this?

[New Player] One of the first ones?

[Time Traveler] You’re going to want to see this

[New Player] Is this a DLC? [Time Traveler] No, Minecraft YouTubers created this.

[New Player] For the cave game? But, It’s just blocks!

[Time Traveler] Um hm, Blocks that have generated a trillion views on YouTube.

[New Player] Why are they digging a hole? [Time Traveler] We prefer the term mining, thank you very much.

[New Player] Where did they learn how to do this? I couldn’t find a tutorial.

[Time Traveler] Tutorial?

There’s no tutorial for this level of creativity, my friend.

[New Player] That looks dangerous. [Time Traveler] It’s redstone, of course its dangerous [New Player] Watch out!

[New Player] Not this bug again.

[Time Traveler] Close, that was a mod.

[New Player] Is that a mod too?

[Time Traveler] No, that’s a hack.

[New Player] Is that even allowed?

[Time Traveler] Technically no, but who’s going to stop them?

[New Player] But, why create all of this?

[Time Traveler] Why? Why not?

You get likes, views and subscribers, if that’s your thing

[Time Traveler] Looks like someone has lost their horse [New Player] Whoa

[New Player] Was this is all part of Mo- jiä...mo-ya...the studio’s plan?

[Time Traveler] Ha!

Oh sorry, you’re serious.

No, even today they still can’t imagine what the future holds.

[Time Traveler 2] Oh, but I can tell you all about it.}}
