An '''enchanting table''' is a [[block]] used to spend [[experience]] and [[lapis lazuli]] to apply [[enchantment]]s to [[tool]]s, [[armor]] and [[Enchanted Book|books]]. Surrounding it with up to fifteen [[bookshelves]] increases both its enchanting power and [[level]] requirement.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
An enchanting table requires a [[pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

== Usage ==
[[File:Enchanting library.png|thumb|right|One-block tall maximal enchanting library]]
An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item in the input slots and 1–3 [[lapis lazuli]] in its dedicated slot. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The [[Standard Galactic Alphabet|glyphs]] here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the "Efficiency II" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.

Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, while paying only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.

The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are "maximum strength" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example.

To increase the enchantment level, [[bookshelves]] should be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of [[air]], or a replaceable block such as [[grass]], between them. Most types of blocks being between the enchanting table and the bookshelves — even transparent blocks like [[torch]]es — prevents the table from connecting with the bookshelves. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a total of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the [[enchanting mechanics]] page for more detailed information on this.

The enchanting table is {{frac|3|4}} blocks high.

Despite comprising largely of [[obsidian]], they are not immune to destruction by the [[ender dragon]].<ref>{{bug|MC-177521|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Enchanting ===
[[File:Enchanting Table GUI.png|thumb|176px|Enchanting interface.]]
{{main|Enchanting mechanics}}
The enchanting table's main purpose is to enchant items. The table can enchant the following items, provided they don't already have [[enchantment]] effects:
*some tools: [[pickaxe]]s, [[shovel]]s, [[axe]]s, [[hoe]]s, and [[fishing rod]]s,
*all pieces of player armor: [[helmet]]s, [[chestplate]]s, [[leggings]] and [[boots]],
*some weapons: [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, [[bow]]s, [[crossbow]]s, [[mace]]s and [[trident]]s,
*[[book]]s.

Many other items can instead be enchanted using an [[anvil]] and an appropriate [[enchanted book]].

When a [[bookshelf]] is placed next to an enchanting table (with one block of air in between) it increases the maximum enchantment level. There must be 15 bookshelves around the enchanting table in order to obtain the maximum enchantment level of 30.

=== Light source ===
Enchanting tables emit a light level of 7.

=== Mysterious text ===
[[File:Enchanting Table animated experience.gif|thumb|Glyphs flowing from the bookshelves animation.]]
In the user interface, text can be seen on each enchantment button. This text is written in the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]]. [[Particles]] of letters from this font are also present when an enchanting table is close to a bookshelf. These cannot be seen if "particles" in the video settings is set to "minimal".

}}

Three to five words are chosen from the list and appended to each other, then displayed. Although sometimes the words chosen accidentally refer to mobs, the words chosen are random and purely cosmetic; they have no relation to the enchantments to be applied to the item and are not saved on the enchanted item (meaning they say nothing about the enchantment's identity), and they are displayed only in the enchanting table. Only the cost and one of the enchantments are known.

=== Custom name ===
By default, the GUI of an enchanting table is labeled "Enchant", but this name can be customized by naming the enchanting table in an [[anvil]] before placing it or by changing the <code>CustomName</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command{{only|Java}}.

=== Note blocks ===
Enchanting tables can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Enchanting tables cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Enchanting tables are midway between slabs and full blocks height-wise, so they could be potentially used as a TNT cannon's range-amplifier instead of slabs or trapdoors.
* The enchanting table always opens its book toward the player, even when the player is invisible.
* On the enchantment screen, captions in the [[w:Commander Keen#Standard Galactic Alphabet|Standard Galactic Alphabet]] includes several in-jokes:
** On October 1, 2011, Notch tweeted an image of the enchantment screen, with enchantments.<ref>{{tweet|notch|120207632228298753|An enchantment table|October 1, 2011}}</ref> The first enchantment translates into "Well Played Internets You Are Good", the second translated into "These Names Will Be Random And Confusing", and the third translates to "Each Spell Costs Experience Levels".
** Three of the possible words for enchantments are "the elder scrolls," likely a joke at Bethesda, creator of ''[[w:The Elder Scrolls|The Elder Scrolls]]'' series and whose parent company, Zenimax, attempted to sue Mojang for the name of their game ''[[Scrolls]]''.
** The words "klaatu berata niktu" are a (misspelled) reference to "[[wikipedia:Klaatu barada nikto|Klaatu barada nikto]]", a phrase that originates from the 1951 movie ''[[w:The Day the Earth Stood Still|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' and has been since used as a reference in many other movies, cartoons and games.
** Similarly, "Xyzzy" is a magic spell in the game ''[[w:Colossal Cave Adventure|Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' and has been used in several other games as an [[Easter eggs|Easter Egg]] or cheat code.
** The word "embiggen" is a fictional word coined by ''[[w:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]'' quote: "A Noble Spirit Embiggens the Smallest Man".
** The words "phnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn" are a quote from H. P. Lovecraft's short story ''[[w:The Call of Cthulhu|The Call of Cthulhu]]''. Said quote is a prayer in the Cthulhu mythos. The complete and correct quote is "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn", which translates to "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming."
* Of the list of words that the enchanting table uses, none of the words contain the letters "J" or "Q". Although they are not used in the words, they do have a symbol attached to them, and can be seen moving from the bookshelf and the table.
