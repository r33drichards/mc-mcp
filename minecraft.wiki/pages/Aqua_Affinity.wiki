'''Aqua Affinity''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[helmet]]s that removes the mining speed reduction that occurs when underwater.

== Obtaining ==
Aqua Affinity can be obtained from [[enchanting tables]], drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]],{{only|bedrock}} books obtained by [[fishing]], librarian [[villager]]s, and in the following structure loot chests: [[desert pyramid]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[ancient cities]], [[mansion]]s, [[pillager outpost]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, and from vaults in [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
Usually when the player's head is underwater, mining blocks takes 5 times as long as mining while out of water. Wearing armor with Aqua Affinity grants 400% [[submerged mining speed]], negating this penalty.

The related but distinct speed decrease for mining while floating also results in a 5 times decrease in mining speed. The penalty for floating is not affected by Aqua Affinity. Mining without Aqua Affinity while underwater ''and'' floating takes 25 times as long as mining while out of water and standing on the ground.

Although unobtainable in Survival mode, {{in|java}} levels higher than 1 increase the submerged mining speed by 400% per level, while {{in|bedrock}} all levels have the same effect.
