[[File:All Professions In 18w50a.png|thumb|right|250px|All plains biome variant professions corresponding to their different utility blocks.]]
[[File:All Profession Levels.png|thumb|right|250px|All five profession levels, indicated by the badges on their suits.]]

'''[[Villager]]s and [[zombie villager]]s'''
* Now have seven skin types which correspond to the following biomes:
** Plains
** Desert
** Savanna
** Taiga/mountain
** Snowy tundra/snowy taiga
** Jungle
** Swamp
* Villagers now have five profession levels, showing how many trade tiers they've unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their suit.
** The first trade tier is represented by a stone badge, the next iron, then gold, emerald and finally diamond.
** Some of the professions have less than five tiers in total.
*** If a villager summoned by a command has a higher level than its natural highest level, its badge can still be seen, however, the player wouldn't be able to interact with it.
* Cured zombie villagers retain their trades when they are converted back into regular villagers.

'''[[Witch]]es'''
* Are now neutral mobs.
* Changed appearance.
** Both of these changes were unintentional.<ref>{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1073198417361424384|The cowl on the witch is not intended. The cowl was always in the texture map but it just wasn't rendered. Due to the new villager model system now it does.|December 13, 2018}}</ref>

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Boat]]'''
* Changed texture.

'''{{EntityLink|id=egg|link=Egg|Thrown eggs}}, {{EntityLink|id=ender-pearl|link=Ender Pearl|thrown ender pearls}}, {{EntityLink|id=experience-bottle|link=Bottle o' Enchanting|thrown bottles o' enchanting}}, {{EntityLink|id=eye-of-ender|link=Eye_of_Ender|eyes of ender}}, {{EntityLink|id=fireball|link=Ghast#Ghast_fireball|ghast fireballs}}, {{EntityLink|id=small-fireball|link=Blaze#Blaze_fireball|blaze fireballs}} (fire charge), and {{EntityLink|id=snowball|link=Snowball|snowballs}} '''
* Now have an optional {{code|Item}} tag that can specify a different item stack to render.
<!-- Sample commands for messing with this:
/summon minecraft:eye_of_ender ^ ^1 ^1 {Item:{Count:1b,id:"minecraft:end_portal_frame"}}
/summon fireball ~ ~ ~ {Item:{Count:1b, id:"minecraft:dragon_egg"},NoGravity:1b,direction:[0.0,0.0,0.0],ExplosionPower:5}
/summon small_fireball ~ ~ ~ {Item:{Count:1b, id:"minecraft:dragon_egg"},NoGravity:1b,direction:[0.0,0.0,0.0]}
(note https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-140959 for the last one).

Also, note that dragon fireball and wither skull do not have one of these, even though ghast fireball does despite not having an item form. -->
