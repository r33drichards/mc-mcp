{{info needed section|
* Does the tooltip background look any different in this snapshot compared to the last one? If so, can a visual comparison be added?

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Dolphin]]'''
* Baby dolphin now spawns naturally at 5% chance.

'''[[Squid]]'''
* Squid [[spawn egg]]s now only spawn adult squid.
** There is a 5% chance of squid spawned in groups in the wild to be a baby.

'''General '''
* When a [[mob]] converts from one type to another (e.g. [[piglin]] to [[zombified piglin]]), the health of the converted mob is set to the same percentage of max health as the original mob had before conversion.
* The calculation for the duration of the effect from [[splash potion]]s has been changed. Splash potions thrown at the player's feet now apply the effect for almost the same duration as when thrown at the head.<ref>{{bug|MC-276970}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Data component format]]'''
* <code>minecraft:item_name</code>
** This component is now always present on every item.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>52</code>.

'''[[Model]]s'''
* All [[Item (entity)|item]] models can now use the <code>broken</code> property in model overrides that was previously limited to just the [[elytra]].
** This has a value of 1 if the item has 1 durability left, or 0 otherwise.
* The appearance of equipment when equipped by players or certain mobs can now be customized by defining 'equipment models' in the [[resource pack]].
** [[Equipment]] model definitions are loaded from <code>assets/<namespace>/models/equipment/<path>.json</code>.
*** These can then be referenced by the <code>equippable</code> component with a model id of <code>namespace:path</code>.
** The model definition is an object with fields: <code>wolf_body</code>, <code>horse_body</code>, <code>llama_body</code>, <code>humanoid</code>, <code>humanoid_leggings</code>, <code>wings</code>
*** All fields are optional, and can be used to specify a list of layers for the given model layer type.
*** Each field contains list of layer objects:
**** <code>texture</code>: namespaced texture location for this layer.
***** <code>namespace:path</code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/equipment/<layer_type>/<path>.png</code>
**** <code>dyeable</code>: object with fields (optional), specifying how this layer behaves when dyed (in the <code>dyeable</code> item tag, and has <code>dyed_color</code> component)
***** <code>color_when_undyed</code>: RGB color int (optional)
***** If specified, this layer is tinted by the color contained in the <code>dyed_color</code> component.
****** If the item is not dyeable or not dyed, it is tinted based on the color specified by <code>color_when_undyed</code>.
****** If <code>color_when_undyed</code> is not specified and the item is not dyed, the layer is hidden.
**** <code>use_player_texture</code>: boolean (default: <code>false</code>), true if this layer texture should be overridden by a texture given by the player.
***** Only used for <code>wings</code> layers, which overrides with the player's custom elytra texture.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>37</code>.
* The tooltip background and frame may now be customized by replacing sprites:
** <code>tooltip/background</code>: The background of the tooltip.
** <code>tooltip/frame</code>: The frame appearing around the tooltip.
** Items with a custom <code>tooltip_style</code> component uses sprites with IDs:
*** <code><namespace>:tooltip/<path>_background</code> and <code><namespace>:tooltip/<path>_frame</code>
* The <code>nine_slice</code> GUI sprite scaling mode has a new optional boolean (true or false, yes or no) property: <code>stretch_inner</code>.
** If <code>true</code>, the inner parts of the texture (i.e. not the corners) are stretched instead of tiled.
** If not specified, defaults to <code>false</code> as before.

'''[[Textures]]'''
* All equipment-related textures were moved to subfolders of the <samp>textures/entity/equipment</samp> directory.
** Player armor textures were moved to <samp>textures/entity/equipment/humanoid</samp> and <samp>textures/entity/equipment/humanoid_leggings</samp>
*** <samp><material>_layer_1</samp> textures were renamed to <samp><material></samp>, and moved into the <samp>humanoid</samp> subdirectory.
*** <samp><material>_layer_2</samp> textures were renamed to <samp><material></samp>, and moved into the <samp>humanoid_leggings</samp> subdirectory.
*** <samp>leather_layer_1_overlay</samp> and <samp>leather_layer_2_overlay</samp> textures were renamed to <samp>leather_overlay</samp> in their respective subdirectories.
** <samp>wolf_armor</samp> and <samp>wolf_armor_overlay</samp> textures have moved to <samp>textures/entity/equipment/wolf_body/</samp> and were renamed to <samp>armadillo_scute</samp> and <samp>armadillo_scute_overlay</samp> respectively.
** <samp>turtle_layer_1</samp> has been renamed to <samp>turtle_scute</samp>.
** Llama decor textures were moved to <samp>textures/entity/equipment/llama_body</samp>
** Horse armor textures were moved to <samp>textures/entity/equipment/horse_body</samp>
** The elytra texture has been moved to <samp>textures/entity/equipment/wings/elytra</samp>
* Armor trim textures have also been moved to match the folder structure of the regular <code>equipment</code> textures.
** Textures in <samp>textures/trims/models/armor</samp> were divided between <samp>textures/trims/entity/humanoid</samp> and <samp>textures/trims/entity/humanoid_leggings</samp>
** For leggings textures, the <samp>_leggings</samp> suffix is dropped.

'''[[Trim]]s'''
* All equippable items with an equipment model defined support rendering trims, based on the <code>trim</code> component.
* Trim textures are loaded from the appropriate folder in the <samp>textures/trims/entity</samp> directory.
** For example, armor with wolf_body layers fetch trims from <samp>textures/trims/entity/wolf_body</samp>

== Experimental ==
'''[[Bundle]]s'''
* When a bundle is used in the hotbar, one group of items is emptied at a time instead of everything being emptied at once.
