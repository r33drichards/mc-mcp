{{Italic title|Java Edition}}
{{:Version history/disclaimer}}
Starting in the period between Beta 1.7.3 and Beta 1.8, [[Mojang Studios]] began to publicly release testing versions of full updates in order to get major feedback, especially for bug reporting. This enabled the official updates to be considerably more stable.

Mojang Studios generally releases [[snapshot]]s on Tuesdays.<ref>{{snap|25w15a}}</ref> Previously, before the release of snapshot [[14w26a]] on June 25, 2014, in the middle of development for [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]], they were released on Thursdays.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|481369603281809408|The Minecraft weekly snapshots will no longer have their regular debuts on Thursdays, we are moving them to Wednesdays starting this week.|June 24, 2014}}</ref> During the period from snapshot 14w26a to release [[Java Edition 1.21.5|1.21.5]], they were released on Wednesdays.

=== Availability ===
{{For|instructions on how to install a snapshot|Tutorials/How to install a snapshot}}

These versions are publicly available, though they are not auto-installed by the [[Minecraft launcher|launcher]] unless the ''Enable snapshots'' checkbox is ticked in the profile editor, and then it will only download the current version's development's set of snapshots and pre-releases. The [[player]] is able to change to other snapshots through the profile editor.

=== Naming ===
{{Main|Version formats#Java Edition}}

There are several development builds of Classic versions of the game which were never released to the public. Some of them are now available through the launcher. In-game, these versions were labeled the same as their public release counterparts (e.g. [[0.0.14a]]), but had distinct differences from the versions released to the public. Classic 0.24 is the only exception to this rule, as it was labeled simply "0.24" in-game, whereas the full release was labeled "[[0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST]]".

There are several [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-0040/Development|builds of Indev 0.31 20091223-0040]] which were never released to the public. Most were still labeled "0.30" in-game. 

The day before [[Java Edition Beta 1.6|Beta 1.6]] was released, Mojang created a [[Java Edition Beta 1.6 Test Build 3|Test Build]] version that was never released, but was nonetheless a development version for Beta 1.6. Between [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3|Beta 1.7.3]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], Mojang began to issue [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release|pre-release]] versions, specifically for Beta 1.8 and what then was known as Beta 1.9. As Beta 1.9 came to be re-designated as release version [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]], candidates subject to release were now known as RCs.

The weekly snapshots for release [[Java Edition 1.1|1.1]] to [[Java Edition 1.21.11|1.21.11]] were named by using the format ''YY''w''WWn''. "''YY''" is the two-digit year, "w" simply stands for "week", "''WW''" is the two-digit week number within the year, and "''n''" is a unique letter identifier – starting with "a", then "b", and so on – for when there is more than one release per week. The highest letter reached was "e", a tie between [[12w30e]], [[13w47e]] and [[15w35e]]. The naming convention is, however, broken by [[13w12~]]. Beginning in 2026, snapshots will use the format ''YY.r''-snapshot-''n'', with "''YY''" being the two-digit year, "''r''" being the release number, and "''n''" being a unique number identifier – starting with "1", then "2", and so on.<ref>{{mcnet|minecraft-new-version-numbering-system|Minecraft’s new version numbering system|December 2, 2025|Staff}}</ref> The update that has the most snapshots is release [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]], with a total of 56 snapshots. The update that has the most pre-releases is release [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], with 10 pre-releases.

Pre-release versions in Beta had the word "pre-release" spelt out in full (with inconsistent inclusion of the hyphen). After 1.0.0, pre-release versions until [[Java Edition 1.7.4|1.7.4]] were released as full versions and incremented the minor version number for each pre-release (for example, [[Java Edition 1.4|1.4]] and [[Java Edition 1.4.1|1.4.1]] were both pre-releases for [[Java Edition 1.4.2|1.4.2]], and the pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.4.7|1.4.7]] is identical to the full release of 1.4.7). From [[Java Edition 1.7.6|1.7.6]] to [[Java Edition 1.13.2|1.13.2]], pre-releases started including "-pre" following the major version, with a number incrementing each version (e.g., [[1.12-pre2]]). [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]] started spelling the word "pre-release" in full again (e.g., [[1.14.1 Pre-Release 2]]), with somewhat inconsistent use of capitalization from then on.

Release candidates were re-introduced with [[1.16 Release Candidate 1]]. These are intended to be the last version before the full release, unless a major game-breaking bug is discovered.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-16-release-candidate|Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate 1|June 18, 2020}}</ref> The update that has the most release candidates is release [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]], with a total of four release candidates.

Experimental snapshots were introduced with [[Java Edition 1.14.3 - Combat Test|1.14.3 - Combat Test]]. This type of snapshot is released only on special occasions, when Mojang developers want to get testing and feedback on a particular set of features that are outside the scope of a [[data pack]], but which they cannot currently include in a normal snapshot or in [[Bedrock Edition version history/Development versions|Bedrock development versions]]. They have fallen out of use since [[Experiments]] enable normal snapshots to include features that aren't yet due to be added.
