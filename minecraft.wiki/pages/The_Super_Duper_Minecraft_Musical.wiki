'''The Super Duper Minecraft Musical''' is a live action/animated hybrid short film, made to promote the [[Super Duper Graphics Pack]].<ref name=":Psyop">{{Citation|url=https://www.psyop.com/work/the-super-duper-minecraft-musical/|title=Microsoft Xbox|author=Todd + Kylie|website=Psyop.com}}</ref>

== Summary ==
<onlyinclude>
The video begins on a stage, decorated with a lone [[Grass Block|grass block]] with an [[Azure Bluet|azure bluet]] on top. {{w|Melissa Benoist}} walks onto the stage, picking up [[dirt]], singing about personal preference. The curtains open, revealing a small hill in the [[Overworld]], which she climbs, before connecting two cables carried with [[Parrot|parrots]], marked "Super" and "Duper." Connecting the two, the world's textures begin to convert to that of the Super Duper Graphics Pack.

A Super Duper [[pig]] riding a [[minecart]] passes by a [[chicken]], converting it instantly. [[Wolf|Wolves]] patrol a [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]] biome and get the upgrade in milliseconds, while a [[villager]] appears out of nowhere. A pig strolls through a [[badlands]] biome, and is transformed into a [[creeper]]. As Melissa continues singing, the biome changes to a desert, which frightens the creeper. A chorus of [[Llama|llamas]] appear, as a villager interjects. The biome then changes to a snowy plains, as a [[squid]] leaps out of the [[river]] and chickens fall from a hot air balloon, transitioning Melissa to a [[pond]].

Stepping across [[Lily Pad|lily pads]], Melissa jumps off a [[cliff]] into a cityscape, her fall apparently broken by an [[explosion]]. Somehow okay, many more mobs begin to dance with her, including [[Steve]], [[Alex]], and many characters from [[skin packs]], climaxing the video as it reveals a huge collection of floating terrain. In the final shot, Melissa is back on the stage, and knocks over a Super Duper [[zombie]].

== Lyrics ==
<poem>
Have you ever thought: Sorry, you’re just not my type;
You’ve got style, but you’re not for me?
But then along comes an image that creates some hype,
And it makes you smile to see
What this world can be
When you’re given the key

To the super-duper, so heart-pounding,
Awesome, stellar, and astounding
Vision that the world has never seen;
Where the specular maps amaze you,
And the danger doesn’t faze you;
In this land where dreamers rule, and you’re the queen.

A llama chorus starts to form,
And soon they’re dancing up a storm.
You said it! What else could be in store?
You feel the wind as it whips on by,
Caused by the chickens who fly so high;
And as they touch the sky, your spirit starts to soar,

’Cause for the first time, you truly see yourself.
So you dig down deep, and you take a leap,
And you land right back where you started, but everything feels new
In this super-duper, realistic, extra-special, fabulistic,
Mystical and magical, dramatic, never tragical
World that waits for you!
</poem>

{{Quote|We got the script from 215 McCann to create a musical, which of course is such an exciting prospect because the nature of musicals is just so playful and inventive. Creating this sort of musical theme around Minecraft felt appropriate because the nature of Minecraft is to be so playful.  We see our singer come out, the curtains open, and then all of a sudden we see this beautiful Minecraft world. Something we’ve always enjoyed doing at Psyop is to invent new ways to create a voice for different brands.|Kylie Matulick<ref name=":Psyop" />}}

{{Quote|One of the things we loved about this is that you start from literally a sketch on a piece of paper. then we have designers do a style frame where it’s a full color sketch. Then we start working with set designers and they start building the things that were in the sketch. We’d seen everything grow from figment to fulfillment, and then Melissa (Benoist, star of Supergirl) gets there and starts performing, it just brings all this life to it. It was breathtaking. Our highest personal accolade is when our commercials are entertainment. So how do we expand the brand’s identity and package it into a beautiful commercial? Hopefully that’s what we’ve done!|Todd Mueller<ref name=":Psyop" />}}

{{Quote|Actress Melissa Benoist, best known for Supergirl but also Glee and The Longest Ride, sings all about Microsoft's world-constructing game in this new video.

The Super Duper Minecraft Musical has Benoist performing in front of a green screen with the various sights and sounds of Minecraft's world. The whole tune is surprisingly catchy, whether you have an affinity for the subject matter or not, and Benoist definitely has a voice that makes the whole thing gel really well.

{{Quote|We love it when games go musical. And if you happen to love both Minecraft and Broadway, this number is for you.

Created to promote its upcoming Super Duper Graphics Pack, Minecraft released “The Super Duper Minecraft Musical!” The peppy video, which takes place in the boxy universe where anything is possible (as long as you’re willing to build it), features Melissa Benoist of Supergirl and Glee as she discovers the brave new world of Super Duper Graphics.|Angela Natividad, Adweek<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/minecrafts-upgraded-look-is-so-special-they-made-a-glee-caliber-musical-about-it/|title=Minecraft's Upgraded Look Is So Special, They Made a Glee-Caliber Musical About It|author=Angela Natividad|website=Adweek|date=November 21, 2017}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|Minecraft mightn't be the sort of game that inspires song and dance, but Melissa Benoist from Supergirl and Glee is here to prove that assumption wrong.

In an ad for the game's Super Duper Graphics Pack set to release next year, Benoist sings about Minecraft and all the possibilities there are to be had...from an optional DLC graphics pack.

== Trivia ==

* Although appearing prominently in the video, [[Stone Stairs|stone stairs]] were not a part of the game at the time of this video's creation.
** Similarly, a structure resembling a [[camel]] appears in the background of a shot.
* The scene of a pig switching places with a creeper is likely a reference to the creeper's origins.
* [[Cactus|Cacti]] can be seen placed in midair and next to itself, which is impossible.
* Following the short's appearance at MINECON, [[Lydia Winters]] remarked "who better to show us Super Duper Graphics than {{Wikipedia|Supergirl}}?" referring to Melissa Benoist's breakout role on the {{Wikipedia|Supergirl (TV series)|2016 series}}. It's unclear if she was cast for the sake of this pun or if it was simply thought of for the show.
