An '''acacia''' is a [[tree]] with gray bark and orange wood found in the [[savanna]] biome. Acacias are around 8 blocks tall and feature distinct diagonal trunks and often multiple canopies.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Acacia Trees.png|thumb|Acacia trees.]]
The way acacias form is distinct. Acacia branches do not grow the same way as on other multi-branch trees (dark oak and giant jungle trees). Some acacias have many straight [[log]]s and a curve at the top, some at the bottom, and some curve from bottom to top. Typically, the canopy consists of just two layers of [[leaves]], sometimes three. Acacia trees have high variability and can take many forms, such as: 

* The common acacia has a diagonal trunk and a single canopy.
* The multi-canopy acacia has a trunk which forks around the middle of the plant. Each end ends in a canopy.
* Another form of multi-canopy acacia exists where a straight trunk is topped with a small canopy, out of which grows an additional trunk ending in a second, higher canopy. These trees often grow taller than the common acacia.

== Generation ==
Acacias spawn naturally only in the [[savanna]] biome and its variants, the [[savanna plateau]] and [[windswept savanna]].

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of acacia:
* {{BlockLink|Acacia Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Acacia Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Acacia Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Acacia Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Acacia Sapling}} ({{frac|1|20}} chance of dropping when leaves decay or are broken)

== Planting ==
Acacia [[sapling]]s can be planted on:
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}

An acacia requires a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 6 blocks above the sapling (7 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, the tree requires 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow).

== Foliage colors ==

{{main|Tint}}

Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, if an acacia is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or mountains biome, it has a blue-green hue.

Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.

== Trivia ==
* In real life, [[wikipedia:acacia|''Acacia'']] is a genus of trees.
* The acacia sapling's color is different from the fully grown tree, as acacia bark is gray while the sapling's bark is brownish orange like the interior of the grown tree's log.<ref>{{bug|MC-94874}}</ref>
* It is the only [[Feature#Plant-like|plant-like feature]] to be found on the surface of which two blocks (acacia logs in this case) predominantly connect via an edge in the air. [[Coral block]]s are the only other feature for which two blocks may connect via an edge only, with water in between, but they are much more rare according to the [[Coral#Natural generation|coral block distribution graph]].
