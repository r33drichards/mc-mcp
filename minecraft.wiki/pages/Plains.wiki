The '''plains''' is a common grassland [[biome]] in the [[Overworld]] that usually generates in flat terrain.

== Description ==
Plains biomes are common and expansive, and can border [[sunflower plains]], [[forest]]s, [[flower forest]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[desert]]s, [[badlands]], [[meadow]]s, [[cherry grove]]s, [[Taiga|taigas]], [[snowy plains]], and [[snowy slopes]]. They are the second most common Overworld biome, after forests, and make up around 11.56%{{verify}} of the Overworld by area. 

Plains are grassy and mostly flat. Many of the [[grass block]]s are covered in [[grass]] or [[tall grass]]. Oak [[tree]]s generate sometimes; {{frac|1|3}} are large, while {{frac|1|20}} have [[bee]]s and [[bee nest]]s.

Some occasional large patches of plains grow various colors of [[tulip]]s. These patches, along with [[flower forest]]s, are the only places where [[tulip]]s generate. [[Oxeye daisies]], [[cornflower]]s, [[dandelion]]s, [[poppy|poppies]] and [[azure bluet]]s, sporadically generate within the plains. [[Bush|Bushes]] also generate in small patches.

[[Village]]s generate in plains, using oak [[planks]] and [[log]]s. [[Pillager outpost]]s generate here as well.

Plains biomes generate at temperatures of -0.450 to 0.500, meaning it generates in 3 temperature ranges: lukewarm, temperate, and cold. When it generates at the lukewarm biome temperature range, [[stony peaks]] generate instead of [[jagged peaks]]/[[frozen peaks]].

== Mobs ==
[[Horse]]s and [[donkey]]s spawn in plains biomes, as well as hostile [[zombie horse]]s during the [[nighttime]].

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
