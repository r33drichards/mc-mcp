'''Mining Fatigue''' is an [[effect]] that reduces [[mining efficiency]] and [[attack speed]], opposite to [[Haste]].

== Effect ==
;Attack speed
The effect decreases [[attack speed]] by 10% per level. For the in-game default level III, attack speed decreases by 30%.

;Mining speed
The [[mining speed]] is reduced to 0.3^''level'' of the normal mining speed. However, due to a bug {{bug|MC-279819}}, increasing the effect level from II to III reduces the mining speed by a factor of 0.03, not 0.3. Thus, for the in-game default level III, the speed is reduced to 0.0027× of normal speed, taking 370 times longer than usual to break a block with its proper tool.

{{In|java}}, levels higher than 4 work like level 4 for the purposes of calculating mining speed. However, attack speed can still decrease, all the way to 0% at level 10.<!-- Negative levels increase attack speed, but still act as level 4 with respect to mining.-->

While afflicted, a player can still [[craft]] and ride entities as usual, but cannot remove most vehicles due to how slowly the vehicle can be broken.

The affliction is cured by drinking [[milk]], although milk does not prevent a subsequent affliction by an elder guardian, which can happen within a few seconds{{only|java}} or immediately.{{only|bedrock}} [[Axolotl]]s can also remove this effect, if the player helps an axolotl kill a mob while an axolotl was battling that mob.

== Causes ==
[[File:Elder guardian screen effect.png|thumb|Mining Fatigue being inflicted by an [[elder guardian]].]]
The only natural cause of Mining Fatigue is from affliction by an [[elder guardian]], when player is close to it and the only natural effect level is III. Other levels can be achieved via [[command]]s. 

{{IN|java}}, once per minute, elder guardians in the vicinity search for any player within 50 blocks to afflict with Mining Fatigue III. A player cannot defend from this attack. Concealment behind blocks, underground, or by a [[potion of Invisibility]] offers no defense.

{{IN|bedrock}}, elder guardians within range afflict Mining Fatigue III immediately. Drinking [[milk]] to remove the effect results in re-infliction immediately after drinking the milk.

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Mining fatigue.
*All [[mob]]s are unaffected by Mining fatigue as they cannot mine blocks.
== Notes ==
* The effect does not affect [[block]] breaking in [[Creative]] mode, or blocks that are [[instant mining|broken instantly]] by default.
* [[Axolotl]]s can remove a player's mining fatigue if the player assisted it killing a mob.
