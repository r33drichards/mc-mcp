'''1.1''' is a major update to {{JE}} released on January 12, 2012,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.mojang.com/2012/01/minecraft-1-1-update/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2012/01/minecraft-1-1-update/|title=Minecraft 1.1 Update|author=Lydia Winters|date=January 12, 2012|website=Mojang.com}}</ref> which adds [[spawn egg]]s, support for multiple [[language]]s, the [[Superflat]] world type, and beaches. It is the first update to begin using [[snapshot]]s, to add support for other languages, and the first of only two major releases that did not introduce any new blocks, second being [[Java Edition 1.18]]. 

There were no subsequent minor versions to 1.1. It was the first version to be released under [[Jens Bergensten]] as the lead creative developer of Minecraft. This is also the first version released in 2012.

== Trivia ==
* 1.1 is the only major release of [[Java Edition]] (including [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] and [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]]) to have no subsequent minor versions.
** Technically, [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]] had no subsequent minor ''client'' versions, as [[Java Edition 1.0.1|1.0.1]] was exclusively a server update.
* The client JAR file erroneously includes raw .java source files for the isometric preview applet under the directory <code>/isom</code>. This would be the first version since [[Classic 0.0.13a]] to do so. The files being:
** <code>isom/IsomPreview.java</code> (dated September 23, 2011, at 14:02)
** <code>isom/IsomPreviewApplet.java</code> (dated February 22, 2011, at 09:13)
** <code>isom/Zone.java</code> (dated February 22, 2011, at 09:13)
** <code>isom/ZoneRenderer.java</code> (dated July 20, 2011, at 11:21)

An official video documenting some of the 1.1's major features was released on Mojang's official [[YouTube]] channel on January 12, 2012. The video was made by Hat Films, who have made update trailers and videos for Mojang in the past.
