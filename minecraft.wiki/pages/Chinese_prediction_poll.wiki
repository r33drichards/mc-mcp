The '''Chinese prediction poll''' was a popularity poll held in China, teasing the announcement at [[MINECON Earth 2018]] of a Chinese "national treasure" coming to ''Minecraft''.<ref name="poll">https://mc.163.com/pe/client/activity/voteforanimalpc/index.html</ref>

This poll did not affect the development of ''Minecraft'', as it took place too close to the MINECON event; it was purely a prediction of which mob would be added.

== Development ==
The available options were the giant panda, Chinese alligator, golden monkey, white-lipped deer, and river dolphin.

When the poll concluded, the [[panda]] won 1<sup>st</sup> place. Then it was announced a few days later during the livestream, and was added to the game in the [[Village & Pillage]] update.
