The '''modified wooded badlands plateau''' or '''mesa plateau stone mutated''' was a rare variant of the [[badlands]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

==Description==
The modified wooded badlands plateau had a weathered appearance and featured smaller plateaus with more erratic terrain, allowing for significantly fewer oak trees to grow at the highest layers. [[Eroded badlands]] replaced the usual thin desert border that this biome variant shared with other biomes.

== Mobs ==
Modified wooded badlands plateaus used the same mob spawning chances as badlands.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
