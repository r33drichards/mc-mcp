{{Outdated feature}}
[[File:Items.png|thumb|<samp>items.png</samp> in [[13w01b]], the last version to actually use this file.]]

'''<samp>items.png</samp>''' was a [[texture atlas]] found inside <samp>[[minecraft.jar]]</samp> that was used to load the game's item textures.

== Format ==
<samp>items.png</samp> is a fixed-width 256×256-pixel file that is split into different 16×16 squares which correspond to the texture of each item found in-game. Like with <samp>[[particles.png]]</samp>, unused sections of the texture are completely transparent, unlike with <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> and the [[kz.png|paintings sheet]] where such regions are colored magenta.

== Usage ==
Before the introduction of [[texture pack]]s, <samp>items.png</samp> was used as the texture file for all items in the game. To change any item textures in-game, it had to be edited and placed inside an edited <samp>minecraft.jar</samp> file.

<samp>items.png</samp> was in use by {{JE}} until [[13w02b]], [[Pocket Edition Alpha]] until version [[Pocket Edition v0.7.0 alpha|v0.7.0 alpha]] and actively by [[Legacy Console Edition]].
