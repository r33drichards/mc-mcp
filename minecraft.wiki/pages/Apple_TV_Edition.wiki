'''''Minecraft: Apple TV Edition''''' is a discontinued derivative of ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' designed to run on {{w|tvOS}}. It was announced on October 27, 2016, officially released on December 19, 2016, alongside the ''[[Fire TV Edition]]'', and discontinued on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{citation|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/27/apple-announces-minecraft-coming-to-tvos-powered-apple-tv-this-year/|title=Apple announces Minecraft coming to tvOS-powered Apple TV this year|author=Chance Miller|website=9to5Mac|date=October 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=mcnet>{{mcnet|apple-tv-edition-released|Apple TV Edition released!|December 19, 2016|Owen Jones}}</ref> The release of the ''Apple TV Edition'' coincided with the [[Ender Update]].

As of [[Pocket Edition 1.1.5|1.1.5]], the ''Apple TV Edition'' has not received new feature updates, such as the [[Better Together Update]], the [[Update Aquatic]], [[Village & Pillage]], [[Buzzy Bees]], and so on. It was previously unclear if or when the ''Apple TV Edition'' would be updated, due to a bug.<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-27640?focusedCommentId=466833&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-466833 MCPE-27640: Apple TV Edition version - Better Together Update]</ref><ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-19383?focusedCommentId=427893&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-427893 MCPE-19383: Apple TV version, corrupted world save.]</ref> The version was officially discontinued with a message provided via the in-game patch notes and removed from the Apple App Store on September 24, 2018.<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-27640?focusedCommentId=490725&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-490725 "Effective Monday September 24th, the Apple TV version of Minecraft will no longer be updated or supported."] – Jay Wells, September 25, 2018</ref>

The ''Apple TV Edition''<nowiki/>'s most recent feature update is the [[Discovery Update]].

== Development ==
=== Release ===
No beta version of the ''Apple TV Edition'' was released. It was announced by [[wikipedia:Tim Cook|Tim Cook]] at the October 2016 MacBook Event and then by Mojang on the day of its release on their website's blog.<ref>{{ytl|EA8vDBY6bCs|Apple – Special Event Keynote – October 2016|Apple|December 8, 2016|t=11m00s}}</ref><ref name=mcnet/>

For a limited time{{more info}}, ''Apple TV Edition'' was bundled with seven pieces of DLC (Holiday 2015, Town Folk, and City Folk skin packs, along with the Plastic, Natural, Cartoon, and Festive 2016 mash-ups). Afterwards, ''Apple TV Edition'' moved from individual pieces of DLC to content in the Minecraft Marketplace. While players could no longer purchase Minecoins as of September 24, 2018, they could continue to use remaining Minecoins to purchase and use content in the Marketplace.

=== Discontinuation ===
On September 24, 2018, ''Apple TV Edition'' was removed from the Apple App Store and the following message was broadcast via the in-game patch notes. The patch notes were localized in all supported languages, with local phone numbers and websites for Apple Support included for each region/country.

{{quote|
Effective from Monday, 24 September, the Apple TV version of Minecraft will no longer be updated or supported. We're grateful to the Apple TV community for their support but we need to reallocate resources to the platforms that our players use the most. Don't worry though, you can continue to play Minecraft on Apple TV, keep building in your world and your Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins) will continue to be available.

However, we know that this experience isn't in-line with the experience on other platforms so we will be issuing full refunds on all purchases made within the last 90 days. For more information or to check on the status of your refund, please contact Apple Customer Service at [Apple Support website] or [Apple Support phone number].

== Nimbus Controller Bundle ==
On September 19th, 2017, Apple, SteelSeries, and Mojang collaborated to release the Nimbus ''Minecraft: Apple TV Edition'' controller bundle.<ref>https://steelseries.com/press/38-steelseries-introduces-nimbus-wireless-controller-minecraft-edition-apple</ref> The bundle cost $39.99 and was available for a limited time only, exclusively at Apple stores in the US and UK. The bundle included a Nimbus controller and a scratch card containing a download code for the game; however, the majority of these codes expired in mid-2018. Since the game could not be properly played without a traditional controller, this bundle was seen as the easiest way for players to get into ''Minecraft: Apple TV Edition''. It is unclear when this bundle was discontinued, but it is likely that it did not sell well.

== Gameplay ==
{{main|Pocket Edition#Gameplay}}

In addition to features which existed in Pocket Edition, the ''Apple TV Edition'' had the ability to play with up to seven players through local multiplayer. However, ''Apple TV Edition'' was out-of-date as of [[Pocket Edition 1.1.7|1.1.7]] and the [[Better Together Update|Better Together]] update and could not play with other ''Bedrock Edition'' platforms beyond this version. It supported [[Realms]], but could only play with other users of ''Apple TV Edition'' after that update.

Due to tvOS limitations on saving app data locally, ''Apple TV Edition'' is the only version of Minecraft that doesn't store world data locally; instead, it is saved to the user's iCloud storage. As a result, this version requires an Internet connection to play, even though world data must be downloaded to the Apple TV device first. Worlds may not save properly if iCloud storage is full or the game is exited too quickly.

== Trivia ==
* Three achievements are impossible to collect due to a bug in the game's final update.<ref>{{ytl|Yk4kf_yfdWE|Literally Who Cares <nowiki>|</nowiki> Minecraft Apple TV Edition - Lost In Obscurity|Bearman3600|June 21, 2024|t=11m23s}}, 11m23s.</ref>
* Keyboard functionality is broken on newer versions of tvOS.
* All DLCs in ''Apple TV Edition'' are included directly in the game's code rather than being downloaded from an external server. While there is no known way to hack the game to unlock the DLC, the default skin can easily be modified to any of the DLC skins or any skin available online.<ref>{{ytl|Yk4kf_yfdWE|Literally Who Cares <nowiki>|</nowiki> Minecraft Apple TV Edition - Lost In Obscurity|Bearman3600|June 21, 2024|t=22m01s}}, 22m01s.</ref>
* ''Apple TV Edition'' is the third-shortest supported version of Minecraft, lasting just 92 weeks before it was discontinued. It is surpassed only by ''[[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]]'' at 70 weeks and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'' at 58 weeks.
* ''Apple TV Edition'' was the last version of ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' to include the ''Edition'' subtitle, as it never received the [[Better Together Update]].
