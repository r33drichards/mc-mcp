Since 2017, MINECON was reduced to a livestreamed event announcing the latest ''Minecraft'' news. Initially it featured a live audience, but now consists only of a pre-recorded broadcast. Initially called ''MINECON Earth'', its name changed to ''MINECON Live'' in 2019 and finally ''Minecraft Live'' in 2020.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{IN|java}}, MINECON capes were given to attendees of the respective year's event. Earlier events granted capes to those who bought tickets without actually requiring attendance at the event, but this was fixed for later events. On May 12, 2020, all unused cape codes were disabled.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{see also|Skin pack capes#MINECON capes}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, the capes were available in [[skin packs]] during [[MINECON 2015]] and [[MINECON 2016|2016]]. Unlike the {{JE}} capes, these skin packs were downloadable for free without needing to visit the event.

The MINECON skin packs featured [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] skins with all of the capes. Like with all skin packs, the capes are attached to the included skins and therefore cannot be equipped with any other skins, so the MINECON capes are not considered to be fully available on this edition.
