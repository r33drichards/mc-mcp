#REDIRECT [[Gear]]
<!--All files inside the game refer to these as gears, and item names were added about half a year after gears were removed. The term "Cog" has ''never'' been used officially. The first recorded statement of this was in 2014, when user "The Wither Steve" added this to the page (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Cog?type{{=}}revision&diff{{=}}614219&oldid{{=}}608036) and nobody bothered to actually verify it, causing it to spiral out of control.-->
