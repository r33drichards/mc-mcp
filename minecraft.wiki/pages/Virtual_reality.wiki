'''Virtual reality''' ('''VR''') was a mode exclusive to {{el|be}} for {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}} (formerly ''[[Windows 10 Edition]]'') and {{w|PlayStation 4}}. It was used with the {{w|Oculus Rift}}, {{w|Reality Labs#Quest|Meta Quest}} (via Link and Air Link), {{w|PlayStation VR}}, and all {{w|Windows Mixed Reality}} compatible headsets.

On September 17, 2024, with the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.30|1.21.30]], [[Mojang Studios]] announced that support for PlayStation VR will be discontinued in March 2025.<ref name=1.21.30>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/30220110283533-Minecraft-1-21-30-Bedrock</ref> This announcement was later extended to all VR devices on October 22, 2024, with the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.40|1.21.40]].<ref name=1.21.40>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog</ref> After players received the final update, they would still receive updates and their [[Marketplace]] purchases will continue to be available, but they will no longer be able to play ''Minecraft'' with a VR headset.<ref name=1.21.30 /><ref name=1.21.40 /> VR support was ultimately removed with the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.80|1.21.80]].

== Launching ==
In order to launch ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' on Windows systems in VR mode, the creation of a custom application shortcut was required.<ref>https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360057619052</ref> This was achieved by following these steps:
* Right-click on desktop menu, select New from the dropdown, and choose to create a new Shortcut.
* For the location of the item enter <code>minecraft://Mode/?OpenXR=true</code>. This is case-sensitive and needs to match exactly.
* On the next screen, a custom name such as {{cd|Minecraft VR}} can be applied.
* The shortcut should appear on the desktop and it should automatically display the ''Minecraft'' icon if set up correctly.
* To play the game in VR, the VR headset must have been connected to the computer and turned on. The game can be launched by clicking the newly created shortcut.

== Gameplay ==
{{incomplete section|describe living room/immersive mode}}
Two different VR modes were available, namely the Living Room Mode and Immersive Mode.<ref name="vr">{{Citation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107210021/https://minecraft.net/en-us/vr/|title=Explore Minecraft in VR|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref> The player can toggle between both modes by pressing the {{tooltip|toggle view button|Y on Oculus Touch controllers}}.{{info needed|mapping on other input devices}}

=== Living Room Mode ===
[[File:VR living room.jpg|thumb|The living room in Living Room Mode]]
The Living Room Mode was selected by default when entering the game. The player was placed in a static environment in form of a dimly lit living room built from ''Minecraft'' assets. The viewpoint was still in VR and the player can look around the room but the gameplay was fixed on the virtual screen in front of them, resulting in an experience similar to playing ''Minecraft'' on a normal screen without VR.
{{-}}

=== Immersive Mode ===
[[File:VR gameplay.jpg|thumb|Gameplay in Immersive Mode.]]
In Immersive Mode, the player assumed the perspective of the [[player|player entity]] in first person, with the game world surrounding them in 360°. The game had full 6DoF support when played with a supported motion controller.<ref name="vr" /><ref name="psvr-review">{{citation|url=https://www.uploadvr.com/minecraft-psvr-review/|title=Minecraft PSVR Review: A Few Blocks Short Of The PC VR Release|author=Harry Baker|date=October 4, 2020|website=UploadVR}}</ref> This allowed players to freely move in the ''Minecraft'' world by walking in the real world and reflects their hand movement on virtual hands displayed in-game. When playing with a regular controller or with mouse and keyboard, the VR experience was limited to head tracking. 
{{-}}

=== Controls ===
{{main|Controls}}
{{incomplete section|Add table with VR specific controls}}
In addition to input devices like mouse & keyboard and controllers, that were compatible with regular {{BE}} gameplay, VR mode allowed the usage of selected motion controllers like Oculus Touch controllers. PlayStation Move controllers were not supported by the game.<ref name="psvr-review" />

=== VR options ===
[[File:VR Settings screen.png|thumb|The VR Settings menu.]]
To reduce motion sickness, various VR options were available to modify the experience. Some options were only available when a motion controller is used as input.
