* Looking through a solid wall of glass blocks is equivalent to looking through a single piece (this does not apply to glass panes of any kind).
** Air blocks make the view blurrier each time.
** Adjacent glass of different colors ignore each other's colors, and render only the terrain behind, with the color of the outermost piece of glass.
** Other translucent blocks may have different effects.
* Has ID number 95, which replaces the locked chest's data value.

***Usually generates between a cold biome, such as [[ice plains]], and a body of water.

'''[[World type]]'''
*[[AMPLIFIED]]

'''[[File:Zombie JE2 BE1.png|width=75x75]] [[Zombie]]s and [[File:Skeleton JE4 BE2.png|width=78x78]] [[skeleton]]s'''
*Zombies and skeletons can now spawn with and drop armor, bows and swords with the "Unbreaking" enchantment.

*No longer inflict fall damage when running aground (old boats need to be replaced for the fix to apply).
*Slightly improved durability from [[lily pad]] impacts.
*Boats have been reverted to the previous "WASD" controls.
**The {{key|A}} and {{key|D}} keys can be used only while the {{key|W}} key is pressed.

=== World generation ===
[[File:Minecraft 1.6 and 1.7 biome map comparison.png|thumb|Comparison between biome maps of Minecraft 1.6 and 1.7.]]

'''[[Biome]]s'''
*[[Jungle]]
**Melons can now be found in patches similar to pumpkins.
**Jungle biomes have been made much rarer.
**Has a jungle edge which has less foliage, but slowly leads into the main jungle.
**Jungle trees now generate with branches.
*[[Swampland]]
**Grass is greener and fluctuates more in color, depending on biome temperature.
**In shallower parts, the coast is covered in staggered dirt block with lily pads between them.
**Spawn with blue orchid flowers.
*[[Plains]]
**Generates three of the new flowers – azure bluets, oxeye daisies and sometimes tulips.
**Double tall grass can also generate here.
*[[Extreme hills]]
**Snow at high elevations of over Y=95.
**Contain [[stone]] and large dirt patches.
**Flat valleys near sea level.
**Can generate up to Y=150, slightly above the clouds (previously Y=124).
**Has much more height variation and has flat parts as well, as opposed to the previous extreme hills which forced endless high peaks to generate.
**The [[extreme hills edge]] variant no longer generates.
*[[Taiga]]
**Now generates without snow.
**Snowy taigas have been implemented as a separate, new biome called "cold taiga".
*[[Ocean]]
**Oceans are smaller and take up much less of the map.
**Contains only gravel on the floor instead of sand, dirt and gravel.
**The [[frozen ocean]] variant no longer generates.
*[[River]]
**Gravel can now generate in [[disk]]s.

'''[[Biome]] categorization'''
*Four main categories based on temperature:
**Snow-covered, cold, medium and dry/warm.
*Biomes avoid getting placed next to a biome that is too different to itself.

'''Biome elevation'''
*Much greater variation of elevation in general.
*Most biomes can generate to Y=100.
*Hills technical biomes have been made taller.

'''Temperature'''
*Each biome has a base temperature that determines whether the biome is snow-covered, whether it rains or snows, or whether it rains at all.
*Biomes are grouped according to their temperature and attempt to generate next to biomes with similar temperatures.
*Temperature decreases by 0.05 every 30 blocks increase in altitude.

'''[[Cavern]]s'''
*Are less dense and interconnected.

'''[[Witch hut]]s'''
*Now generate with a witch inside.
**They formerly generated empty, with witches spawning inside later.

'''[[Bonus chest]]s'''
*Can now contain acacia logs.

'''[[World boundary]]'''
*All blocks beyond X/Z 30 million (±30,000,000) from origin now act as solid blocks.
**This includes air blocks.
**This creates essentially an invisible wall at the boundary.
**This boundary and blocks beyond it cannot be selected, and are unbreakable by any means.
**Despite functioning like a solid block, it cannot be placed using the {{cmd|setblock}} command, and does not exist in an item form, unlike other blocks.
**As all blocks function as solid, if the player is moved outside the boundary via external tools, they are unable to move outside the block space they are within.
***Despite that, the camera can still move normally.
**Ghost [[chunk]]s still generate.
**Spiders can climb this boundary, since all blocks function as solid.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Fishing]]'''
*Items other than [[fish]] can be obtained by fishing.
**These are divided into three classes.
***Fish: raw fish, [[raw salmon]], [[clownfish]] and [[pufferfish]].
***Treasure: enchanted [[fishing rod]]s, enchanted [[bow]], [[enchanted book]]s, [[name tag]]s, [[tripwire hook]], [[lily pad]]s and [[saddle]]s.
***Junk: damaged fishing rods, [[water bottle]]s, [[rotten flesh]], [[string]], [[leather]], [[bowl]]s, [[stick]]s, [[bone]]s, [[tripwire hook]]s, ten stacked [[ink sac]]s and damaged [[leather boots]].

'''[[Enchanting]]'''
*"Unbreaking" can now be applied to any item with durability.
**[[Armor]], [[bow]]s, [[fishing rod]]s & [[sword]]s can receive the enchantment directly without the use of [[enchanted book]]s.
*New enchantments for fishing rods that can bias the outcome of fishing.
**[[Lure]] – reduces wait time to catch an item; increases the chance of catching fish and decreases the chance of junk and treasure.
**[[Luck of the Sea]] – increases chance of getting treasure and decreases chance of getting junk.
*Enchanted books can receive multiple enchantments at once.

'''[[Nether portal]]'''
*Can now have different width and height, to allow for design variations.
**If the one in the Nether is big enough, [[ghast]]s can go through them.
*Portals can be activated when any [[fire]] block appears inside the frame.
**Before only the bottom-most blocks would work.
*New nether portal building rules: Any rectangular size from 4×5 to 23×23.

'''[[Fog]]'''
*Fog now covers 25% of the view distance instead of 75%.

'''Death screen'''
*If the player dies and selects the 'Title screen' button, a prompt asks if they are sure they want to quit, and give the player the options to go to the title screen or respawn and continue playing.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
*Can now use [[statistics]] and [[achievement]]s to create objectives.
**Added 744 new objective criteria that were previously tracked only through statistics and achievements.

'''[[Commands]]'''
*{{cmd|time set day}}
**Sets the time to 1000 instead of 0.
*{{cmd|time set night}}
**Sets the time to 13000 instead of 12000.
*Custom NBT data can be added via commands.
**Works with {{cmd|give}}, {{cmd|summon}}, and {{cmd|setblock}}.
**Syntax examples:
***{{cmd|give @p 1 1 0 {display:{Lore:["Hi,","How are you?"],Name:"Nice Stone Block"},ench:[{id:1,lvl:10}]} }}
***{{cmd|summon Pig ~ ~ ~ {Saddle:1,CustomName:"Babe",CustomNameVisible:1} }}
***{{cmd|setblock ~ ~ ~ 397 3 replace {SkullOwner:MHF_Pig} }}
**This removes the need to use external tools.
*{{cmd|give}}
**Prints renamed items' name by default in chat. The chat shows the corresponding tooltips when hovered over.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
*<code>Unbreakable</code> tag.
**Applies to items with durability.
**Nullifies any usage dealt to the item.
*List tags no longer need to be named.
*No longer crashes when given the wrong type (integer/short).
*Added <structure>.dat files in data folder for storing structure data.
**Contains .dat called Village.dat, Fortress.dat (Nether Fortress), Temple.dat (Desert temple, jungle temple and witch hut), Stronghold.dat, Mineshaft.dat and others.
**NBT structure consists of the individual parts of each structure, labeled "children", the chunk it originates in, a tag called BB, and an ID for what type of structure it is.
***The children tags have information on each part of the structure and the type of part it is.

'''Block/Item [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values#IDs|IDs]]'''
*Can be referred to by their names, instead of numbers in commands.
**Named references are planned to be be the only option in the future.
**Necessary for the [[Plugin API]].

=== General ===
*Block and entity bounding boxes are now completely black instead of dark gray.
*The entity hitbox toggled with {{key|F3+B}} is now completely transparent, with a thin white outline.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
*Complete menu overhaul with two columns, for selecting which of the downloaded resource packs should be rendered.
**The ability to select multiple resource packs at once.
**Resource packs at the top take precedence over those below, if files appear more than once.
**Allows for non-manual merging of multiple packs.
***For example: a sound pack and a different texture pack, etc.
*Servers can now offer default resource packs.
**Can be configured to be "enabled", "disabled" or "prompted".
*The player is now able to add new sounds using resource packs, rather than replacing previously existing sounds.
*Resource packs can remove, supplement, randomize and group sounds using JSON.
*Maximum total size increased to 50 MB.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
*Sounds and music are stored together in the new .minecraft/assets/sounds folder.
*Music now pauses when pausing the game.

'''[[Lighting]]'''
*Several lighting issues fixed.
*A lot fewer "black spots" in terrain generation.
**Some black spots occurrences have to be kept, in order to avoid a bug in world generation, associated with a complete removal of them.
*Torch bugs in [[stronghold]]s and [[mineshaft]]s have been fixed.
*The light level actually falls to 7 during thunderstorms.
**Before it stayed at 12 like normal rain, but hostile mobs could spawn as if the light level was 7.
**The clouds go black and the sky goes much darker.

'''[[Chat]] system'''
*"Saved screenshot as" messages can be clicked to open the [[screenshot]]s.
**It takes the player out of the game and into the ".minecraft" folder.
*Ability to open a URL from the chat by clicking on it.
*Names can be clicked to DM people.
*Support for both hover and click events on the chat through {{cmd|tellraw <player> <raw json message>}}.
**Syntax example: <code><nowiki>/tellraw @p {text:"Daytime? ",color:"green",extra:[{text:"Click here!",color:"blue",clickEvent:{action:"run_command",value:"/time set day"}},{text:" Nighttime? "},{text:"Click here!",color:"blue",clickEvent:{action:"run_command",value:"/time set night"}},{text:" Have fun!"}]}</nowiki></code>.

'''[[Inventory]]'''
*In Creative mode, the display symbol for the "Decoration Blocks" tab was changed from rose to peony.
*The armor boxes go black when the cursor is away from them.
**Putting the cursor over an armor box causes it to display what armor is put there.

'''[[Title screen]]'''
[[File:1.7.2 old graphics card warning.png|thumb|Old graphics card warning in the title screen.]]
*A warning message now appears on computers with a graphics card that does not support OpenGL 2.1, warning the player that their configuration may prevent them from playing a future version.
**Clicking on the warning will take the player to a page on the Mojang Support website, with more information about ''Minecraft''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s system requirements.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/325948|title=Minecraft system requirements|archive=1|archive-time=20140905000313|website=Mojang Support|date=22 July 2014}}</ref>

'''[[Options]]'''
*Grouped a few options into the controls section:
**Allowed rebinding of 1–9 hotkeys, screenshot key, cinematic camera toggle (can be rebinded and no longer has a default key) and camera switching.
*Added sprint button, which is kept engaged while held (it's left control by default).

**The player can remove the shader by pressing F4.
*Language selection
**Added 'Force Unicode Font' toggle, which allows the player to change whether Unicode font, is forced for text or not.

'''Network code'''
*Completely rewritten – uses [https://netty.io/ Netty].
*Most packets won't change, handshake and ping procedure redone.
*There is now a packet length header.

'''Logging'''
*Now done using ''[http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/ Log4j 2]''.
*Default logging location is now in ''logs/latest.logs''; older logs are archived in ''logs/<year>-<month>-<day>-1.lg.gz'' with the number at the end increasing each startup.
