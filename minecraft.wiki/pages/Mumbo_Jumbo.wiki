== In the ''Minecraft'' franchise ==
{{Expand section|Go into what the panels were about, list other appearances in official media}}
To promote the release of {{MCE}}, a series of videos starring Mumbo and [[Grian]] were produced.<ref>{{YouTube link|MI0xtYsyvtU|Minecraft Live: Minecraft Earth Road Trip|Minecraft|October 14, 2025}}</ref> To assist with the production, a special [[Mumbo Jumbo & Grian Skins|skin pack]] was given to them; the game lacked the ability to import [[Skin|skins]] directly.

In 2019, to celebrate the culmination of one trillion views on Minecraft content, Mumbo made a cameo appearance in [[One Trillion Minecraft Views on YouTube and Counting]]. This video featured him and Grian riding on a moving house, an actual creation of Mumbo's, which he was pleased to see animated.<ref>{{YouTube link|yhtGo8XkUT4|I made a Walking House in Minecraft 1.14|Mumbo Jumbo|June 11, 2019}}</ref>

=== Events ===
In 2016 he was on a panel at MINECON 2016 which was the first dedicated to the Hermitcraft server.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kXNilKho2w MINECON 2016 Hermitcraft: Growing and Maintaining a Strong Server Community] - Minecraft YouTube, Oct 29, 2016</ref>

In 2018, he attended a panel at [[MINECON Earth 2018|MINECON Earth]], that was also about Hermitcraft server.<ref>{{YouTube link|kLuu8Uf9imo|MINECON Earth community panel - Hermitcraft Presents: Creating, Maintaining, and Evolving An SMP|Minecraft|September 29, 2018}}</ref> In the beginning the hermits explained what they like about playing in a multiplayer environment with a diverse set of like minded people. They emphasized a need to patient in their meetings because of all of their cultural differences. They then moved on to talking about the hardware and software side of running a server while Mumbo got called out for the amount of lag he creates. The hermits then transition into talking about fostering their own community servers and Mumbo shares the importance of having a dedicated team who works tirelessly to maintain that community. After that they talk about fostering friendships through multiplayer Minecraft and how community games like Grian’s tag and shopping districts are invaluable to the multiplayer experience. They conclude the panel by explaining the work that goes into setting up a new season of Hermitcraft and pranks on the Hermitcraft server.

He was also on similar panel at [[MINECON Live 2019]] about the Hermitcraft Server.<ref>{{YouTube link|nzmu9YJbqDs|HermitCraft: Much better together!|Minecraft|September 29, 2019}}</ref>

=== ''A Minecraft Movie'' ===
In 2025, he made a cameo appearance in {{AMCM}} alongside several other creators as {{AMCM|Auction Attendees}} at an auction for {{AMCM|Steve}}'s belongings.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Useless machines epitomize what I love most in redstone creations. They are decently complicated from a wiring perspective, incredibly satisfying when built well, and totally pointless. This trifecta of attributes is what I look for in my favorite builds (with pointlessness being the most important).|Oli being interviewed on redstone<ref>{{Mcnet|useless-machines|Useless Machines|February 19, 2020|Chris Priestman}}</ref>|image=MumboJumboFace.png|image-class=pixel-image}}

== Trivia ==
* Mumbo was delighted to see the [[creaking]] get introduced, having always wanted a "{{Wikipedia|Weeping Angel|'weeping angel'}} esque [[Mob|mod]]{{Sic}}".<ref>{{Tweet|ThatMumboJumbo|1840090416206541027|This is stupidly cool. <br><br>I’ve wanted a ‘weeping angel’ esque mod since I first played with the mod back in 2011!}}</ref>
* While visiting the set of ''A Minecraft Movie'', the thing he was most impressed by was the design of the props, singling out a square potato.<ref name=":visit" />
* In 2019, an article on [[Minecraft.net]] linked to a video of Mumbo's, recommending it for hiding buttons.<ref>{{Mcnet|how-build-hidden-doors|How to build hidden doors|September 14, 2019|Chris Priestman}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|t3-lF1vXjJU|Best Ways to Hide a Button in Minecraft!|Mumbo Jumbo|October 1, 2016}}</ref>
