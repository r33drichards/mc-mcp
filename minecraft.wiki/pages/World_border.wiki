{{relevant tutorial|Getting to the world border}}
The '''world border''' is the horizontal boundary of a [[dimension]].

== Features ==
[[File:Minecraft world border.png|thumb|The world border as seen from the outside using the {{cmd|tp}} command.]]
World borders are square, with faces 29,999,984 blocks away from the [[Coordinates#Coordinate system|world origin]] of their dimensions by default. They are animated with narrow, diagonal stripes that slowly shift up and to the right from the perspective of the inside.

The world border is [[tint]]ed depending on if its size is changing and how. By default, when the border is not changing, the stripes are a translucent aqua color. If the border is expanding, the stripes appear green, and if the border is shrinking, they appear red.

The world border appears different depending on [[graphics settings]]. On the Fast and Fancy settings, it appears as light and translucent, but with the Improved Transparency option enabled, it appears considerably darker.<ref>{{bug|MC-187669}}</ref>

The world border does not visually continue below [[altitude]] Y=-1024 nor above Y=1024, but it does continue function as a boundary.
=== Size ===
The world border is essentially a giant bounding box. By default, its center lies ''above'' Y=255.{{More information needed}}

With [[#Commands|commands]], the center and width of the world border can be modified. The world border's physical barrier (as opposed to its appearance) always behaves in full-block increments from its origin. If the world border's width is set to a odd or non-whole number, the physical barrier's coordinates are rounded up to the next integer.

If the player uses an unlinked [[Nether portal]] at the world border in the Nether, the resulting portal will not be placed further than the world border in the [[Overworld]], although part of the obsidian frame may generate past it.

== Effects ==
=== On entities ===
All [[entities]] are unable to move through the world border.

If a [[dispenser]] or [[dropper]] is placed so that it directly faces the edge of the border, then items, projectiles, TNT, etc. can be fired outside of the edge of the border. Any items fired out of a dispenser float in midair; if an item is dropped from the player inventory, the item falls normally.

If a [[mob]] is spawned from a dispenser via a spawn egg, the mob behaves normally. [[Spider]]s can climb the world border, and [[endermen]] can teleport outside of it and [[Pillager|Pillagers]] can walk through it.

Any [[player]]s on the outside of the world border (with exception to those in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode) take constant damage as long as they are outside the border. The amount of damage depends on the distance to the border, with damage being inflicted when the player is outside an area that is 5 blocks wider than the world border on each side. Players typically cannot interact with blocks or entities outside the world border.

Additionally, while [[sneaking]] if they are less than one block outside the world border, some of the effects that occur while sneaking are changed or removed. These are:
*Being prevented from walking off edges
*Having movement slowed
*Decreased eye level and {{control|third-person view}}, character model bending over slightly
*Shorter hitbox
*Fainter name tag in [[multiplayer]]{{verify}}
*Moving through [[scaffolding]]: the player instead falls through it as if it were air

If the player was already sneaking before entering this area, their eye level and third-person view remains decreased.

While players themselves cannot move through the world border, even if they manage to go ahead of chunk loading, they can reach the other side of the world border through other means, including: 
*Letting the world border pass them as it is shrinking
*Throwing an ender pearl through the world border
*Consuming [[chorus fruit]] near the world border and being teleported beyond it
*Dying and respawning, if the spawn point is outside the world border

Oddly, while standing inside the world border while close to it and looking at it at a negative angle, trying to {{control|use item}} (such as throwing [[projectile]]s, eating [[food]], or shooting a [[bow]]) results in nothing happening.

Entities cannot spawn naturally outside the world border. They persist without taking damage if they spawned before the world border gets shrunk by a command.

=== On blocks ===
Players cannot normally place and destroy blocks, nor interact with objects outside of the world border, as there are no hitboxes. It ''is'' possible to place blocks outside of the world border, either by placing the block against one that is inside the world border or by using commands.

Most blocks still function outside the world border, and most [[redstone]] contraptions still function as well. Exceptions include falling blocks (such as [[sand]] and [[gravel]]), which drop as an [[Item (entity)|item]], and [[piston]]s or [[hopper]]s, which simply don't function. [[Explosion]]s from [[TNT]] and other sources also work normally, destroying terrain outside of the border. [[Light]] from [[torch]]es and other sources also remain unaffected.

[[File:Liquids flow through border.png|thumb|200px|Liquids flow through the world border, so long as they are placed ''inside'' the border.]]

[[Liquid]]s can flow through the border and continue flowing until reaching their flow limit. Liquids cannot be placed on the outside of the border.<ref>Due to {{bug|MC-54119}}, this appeared possible, but it did not actually take effect. The said bug was fixed on 1.18</ref> Liquids placed via a [[dispenser]] flow as normal. Mixing [[water]] and [[lava]] with a dispenser results in the flow of each liquid abruptly ending, presumably because the [[stone]], [[cobblestone]], or [[obsidian]] that would normally generate does not.

=== When set to invalid values ===
The world border size can be changed by manually editing the <samp>[[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]]</samp> file. In any case, there remains a [[world boundary]] at 30 million blocks on both the X and Z axes. 
*When set to 0 or a negative number, the entire world is treated as outside the world border, and the border warning overlay appears throughout the world. No blocks can be mined and entities take damage unless they are within the border safe zone.
*When set to NaN (Not a Number), the entire world is treated as outside the world border, but no border warning appears. No blocks can be mined, even in Creative mode, although entities do not take damage.
*When set to Infinity or a number greater than 30 million, the border occurs normally.

== Commands ==
{{main|Commands/worldborder}}
The {{cmd|worldborder}} command can modify the size, center, damage and buffer of the world border, and can also make it grow or shrink gradually.

== Data values ==
=== World data ===
{{edition|java}}:
<div class="treeview">
*<samp>[[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]]</samp>
**{{nbt|compound|Data}}
***{{nbt|double|BorderCenterX}}: Center of the world border (X-axis).
***{{nbt|double|BorderCenterZ}}: Center of the world border (Z-axis).
*** {{nbt|double|BorderDamagePerBlock}}: Damage taken per block moved outside the world border,
***{{nbt|double|BorderSafeZone}}: Distance in blocks of the buffer zone where damage is not taken when outside the world border.
***{{nbt|double|BorderSize}}: World border diameter.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|projects=MC}}

== Trivia ==
*The reason the default world border is at X/Z ±29,999,984 is due to the fact that Dinnerbone put it 1 chunk (16 blocks) short of the edge so that there isn't a sudden "drop" off the edge of the world.<ref>{{bug|MC-53390#comment-155580}}</ref>
*Were a ''Minecraft'' world somehow wrapped around into a sphere, the resulting planet has a circumference of 60,000 kilometers or 9,549 kilometers in radius, twice as large as Earth.
