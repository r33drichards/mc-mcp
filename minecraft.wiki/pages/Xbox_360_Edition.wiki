'''''Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition''''' is the {{el|lce}} version of ''[[Minecraft]]'' for the {{w|Xbox 360}}, developed by [[4J Studios]] in conjunction with [[Mojang Studios]] and {{w|Xbox Game Studios}}.<ref>[https://marketplace.xbox.com/Product/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584111f7 "Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition"]</ref> It was announced at the 2011 E3 conference by [[Markus Persson|Notch]] and Microsoft, and was released alongside a free trial version on May 9, 2012 on Xbox Live Arcade. It was priced at US$19.99.

The ''Xbox 360 Edition'''s most recent feature update was the [[Update Aquatic]].

Although the Xbox 360 console has been discontinued with all the other [[Legacy Console Edition]]s, the ''Xbox 360 Edition'' continued to receive feature updates until the release of the [[Update Aquatic]].<ref>{{Mcnet|update-aquatic-coming-legacy-console-editions|Update Aquatic Coming To Legacy Console Editions|May 3, 2018}}</ref>

As of the shutdown of the Xbox 360 Marketplace on July 29, 2024, it is no longer possible to purchase this game digitally, though it can still be redownloaded if the game was previously purchased and physical copies still function normally.

{{Main|Skin pack}}

4J Studios produced multiple skin packs as downloadable content. Each skin pack included about 45 skins to choose from. The first skin pack, [[Skin Pack 1]], was released July 16, 2012 at a cost of US$1.99. The Skin Pack contained characters from Xbox 360 games, such as the {{w|Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief}} from {{w|Halo (franchise)|''Halo''}}.

The Marvel Skin Packs Bundle was released on November 30, 2015, and contained all of the Marvel skin packs:
* [[Marvel Avengers Skin Pack]]

* [[Marvel Spider-Man Skin Pack]]

The bundle was meant to be a discount for the Marvel skin packs.

This bundle costed US$6.99 and was available in the Xbox One and the Xbox 360.<ref name="store2">[https://microsoft.com/p/minecraft-marvel-skin-packs-bundle/bxp6gc8rj8p1 "Minecraft Marvel Skin Packs Bundle"]</ref><ref name="tweet">{{tweet|4j|678889627285979137|Today is the last day the #MinecraftXbox1 & #MinecraftXbox360 Marvel Skin Packs will be available in the Xbox Store.|December 21, 2015}}</ref> The Marvel skin packs from the bundle still transfered to ''Bedrock Edition'', but they were not usable in online or LAN multiplayer.
