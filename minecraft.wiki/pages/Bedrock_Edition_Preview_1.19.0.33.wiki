== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Settings]]'''
* Added "Notificaton duration" option to the accessibility settings, which defaults to 3 seconds.
** Used to change duration of notifications.

== Fixes ==
'''Allay'''
* Allay, for now, does not teleport with its owner to Nether. This is a temporary change until an issue where Allays would sometimes get teleported inside blocks and suffocate when changing dimension gets fixed. ({{bug|MCPE-155678}})

'''Blocks'''
* Non-generated Sculk Shriekers now have a cooldown between activations, just like their generated counterparts ({{bug|MCPE-153944}})
* Sculk Shriekers and Sculk Sensors do not drop XP anymore when mined with Silk Touch ({{bug|MCPE-153359}}, {{bug|MCPE-153965}})
* Increased the time required to destroy Reinforced Deepslate and made it independent by the used tool, to better match Java Edition ({{bug|MCPE-154097}})
* Sculk cannot spread through Fire and Soul Fire anymore

'''Mangrove Swamp'''
* Mangrove trees now grow properly at negative Y coordinates ({{bug|MCPE-154983}})

'''Graphical'''
* Fixed graphical corruption issues on Android ({{bug|MCPE-155509}})
* Fixed an issue that could cause severe visual glitches when using emotes more than once ({{bug|MCPE-155049}})

'''Movement'''
* Actors using movement prediction will once again teleport smoothly

'''Stability and Performance'''
* Improved game performance on certain Android devices ({{bug|MCPE-142934}})
* Fixed a crash that could occur when attempting to render blocks that rely on biome data

'''User Interface'''
* Shift-clicking items will once again combine items of same type into a stack ({{bug|MCPE-153992}})

'''Blocks'''
* Fixed behavior of Command Blocks when cloning another Command Block onto self where the cloned Command Block would not execute its command until a Redstone signal is toggled

'''GameTest Framework (Experimental)'''
* Dedicated server has been updated to allow servers to explicitly list which script modules they want loaded when running scripts. A default configuration file is located at /config/default/permissions.json. Without this new file, all script modules are disabled by default</onlyinclude>
