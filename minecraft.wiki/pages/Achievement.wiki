{{relevant tutorial|Achievement guide}}

'''Achievements''' (known as '''trophies''' on PlayStation) are ways to gradually guide new players into ''Minecraft'' and give them challenges to complete, similar to the system of [[advancement]]s {{in|JE}}.

There are 132 achievements (135 trophies) {{in|be}}.

== Obtaining ==
Every achievement is tracked per user account. They are not tracked separately per world; achievements earned in one world apply to all worlds using that edition and that user account. Achievements are tracked separately on each platform of ''Bedrock Edition''. Achievements do not carry over to other platforms when using the same account. On most platforms that ''Bedrock Edition'' runs on, achievements are logged to a Microsoft account, so players have to be logged in to their Microsoft account to earn them. On PlayStation, ''Bedrock'' achievements are logged as trophies to the player's console account, and if logged into a PlayStation Network account and online, they are synced with the PlayStation Network but not the Xbox network (even if logged into a Microsoft account).

They are independent of one another, allowing players to get them in any order. Once earned, they cannot be reset.

A Microsoft account (PlayStation Network account on PlayStation) is used to track achievements. The game can be played without being logged in, but achievements cannot be earned when doing so.

Achievements grant the player gamerscore on all platforms except PlayStation, totaling 2,970. The achievements also show characters instead of blocks or items.

Some achievements also give rewards, which include [[emotes]] and [[character creator]] items. They can be unlocked only by completing their respective achievement. There are 102 achievements that offer rewards for their completion.

== Unobtainability ==
[[File:Ore UI - Read More or Play World Button - You Can't Earn Achievements Pop-Ups (Bedrock).png|thumb|The pop up informing the player that certain settings disable achievements in the [[Create New World|create new world]] screen.]]
There are some conditions that permanently disable the ability to earn achievements in a world if one or more criteria are met:

* The world was created in [[Creative]] mode.
* The world was created as a [[flat world]].
* External [[behavior packs]] are activated.
* [[Cheats]] are enabled.
** The world creator has set people who joined to have operator permissions (cheats on).
* [[Experiments]] are enabled.
* The world was created using the [[demo mode]] world.
* The world was made from a [[World template|template]].
* The world was made with ''[[Bedrock Editor]]''.
Additionally, achievements cannot be earned or viewed in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''.{{-}}

== List of achievements ==
Note that the achievements are categorized as they are shown in-game using the default sorting. With the the '[[File:Ore_UI_-_Filter_&_Sort_Button_Icon_(Bedrock).png|link=|width=27x27]]' button, the list can be sorted and filtered on game progress, the named update each achievement has been added, or the player's progress. Each achievement can be marked or unmarked as "in progress" on the achievement's details.
