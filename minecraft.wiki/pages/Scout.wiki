== Appearance ==
{{Empty section}}

== Personality ==
Normally, Scout is a very mellow figure. For an adventurer, Scout is very passionate, bordering on addicted, and will often rush into danger without a second thought, even if she lacks any context. In spite of her eccentricities, she is a very talented and competent warrior.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|When you’re facing danger, uncertainty and overwhelming odds, Scout is the person you want by your side. Though she’s chilled and mellow, mention danger and Scout will get a glint in her eye, which is perhaps a little unsettling. Mention mortal peril and Scout will bellow, “I WAS BORN FOR THIS!”, unsheathe her blade of choice and pile straight out the door – before returning to double-check who she was meant to be stabbing. Sure, Scout’s enthusiasm for the cut-and-thrust of combat may occasionally get the entire group into trouble – explosive, fire-breathing, clawed trouble – but she’s the person you need to help send it packing again.|[[Marsh Davies]]<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-mags-colourful-characters|Meet the Mag’s Colourful Characters|August 11, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>|image=Marsh Davies Mojang avatar.png}}
