=== Items ===
{{Animate|Copper Nautilus Armor (item).png;Iron Nautilus Armor (item).png;Golden Nautilus Armor (item).png;Diamond Nautilus Armor (item).png;Netherite Nautilus Armor (item).png|32px|class=pixel-image}} '''[[Nautilus Armor]]'''
* Equippable on nautiluses and zombie nautiluses.
* Has [[Copper Nautilus Armor|copper]], [[Iron Nautilus Armor|iron]], [[Golden Nautilus Armor|gold]], [[Diamond Nautilus Armor|diamond]], and [[Netherite Nautilus Armor|netherite]] variants.
** Copper, iron, golden, and diamond nautilus armor now have a chance to be found in the [[chests]] for the following [[structures]]:
*** [[Buried treasure]]
*** [[Ocean ruins]]
*** [[Shipwreck]]
** Copper, iron and golden nautilus armor can be smelted into the respective [[nugget]]s.

{{Animate|Nautilus Spawn Egg.png;Zombie Nautilus Spawn Egg.png|32px}} '''[[Spawn Egg]]s'''
* Added nautilus and zombie nautilus spawn eggs.

{{Animate|Wooden Spear.png;Stone Spear.png;Copper Spear.png;Iron Spear.png;Golden Spear.png;Diamond Spear.png;Netherite Spear.png|32px}} '''[[Spear]]'''
* New weapon that can be crafted in [[Wooden Spear|wood]], [[Stone Spear|stone]], [[Copper Spear|copper]], [[Iron Spear|iron]], [[Golden Spear|gold]], [[Diamond Spear|diamond]] and [[Netherite Spear|netherite]] versions.
** Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use.
** Copper, iron and golden spears can be smelted into the respective [[nugget]]s.
* Can be enchanted with the exclusive enchantment [[Lunge]], in addition to the available enchantments for [[sword]]s.
* Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage.
** Has extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons.
* [[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s and [[piglin]]s can spawn holding a spear.
* Has two attacks: jab and charge.
** Jab
*** Used by quick-pressing the {{control|attack|text=primary action button}}.
*** Is a low-damage attack with knockback.
*** Has a cooldown between attacks.
*** Wooden spears have the fastest cooldown, while netherite has the slowest.
*** Can hit multiple enemies.
** Charge
*** Used by holding the {{control|use|text=secondary action button}}.
*** Damage is based on spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target.
*** While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
**** Engaged: The spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Tired: Indicated by the spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Disengaged: Indicated by the spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold.
*** The spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players.

* Can be tamed in the same fashion as a regular [[horse]], and can then be mounted and controlled by a player.

*** Damage is computed based on both the user's and target's velocity projected onto the view vector (via dot product).
*** The more the user and target move toward each other and align with the view vector, the higher the damage.
*** After applying {{cd|"damage_multiplier"}} and {{cd|"damage_modifier"}}, the resulting damage is floored to the nearest lower integer.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|"delay"}}: Ticks to wait before applying damage and effects.
*** {{cd|"reach"}}: Range along the view vector where entities can be hit.

** Requirements:
*** Requires the {{cd|"minecraft:use_modifiers"}} item component on the same item.
* Added the {{cd|"minecraft:piercing_weapon"}} item component.
** Description:
*** Allows an item to deal damage to all entities detected in a straight line along the user's view vector.
