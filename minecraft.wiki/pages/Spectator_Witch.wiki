A '''spectator witch''' is a [[witch]] that retains the modifications of a [[Spectator Villager|spectator villager]]. They are found in the [[warden arena]] in a [[Mine (dimension)|mine]] with [[Mine Ingredient#Challenges|eternal lightning storm]] where they appear as the audience of the [[Warden (April Fools' joke)|warden boss]] fight. It was introduced in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Spawning ==
Spectator villagers transform into witches in warden arenas that generate in mines or special mines containing both the [[Mine Ingredient#Special Events|Warden Boss Fight ingredient]] and the Eternal Lightning ingredient.

They do not face the stage when spawned until the world is reloaded.

A witch has an 8.5% chance of dropping a [[potion]], if it is killed while drinking it. The chance is increased by 1% for every level of Looting. The following potions can be drank by a witch and can therefore be dropped:
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Healing}}
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Fire Resistance}}
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Swiftness}}
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Water Breathing}}

{{xp|5}} [[experience]] is dropped when kill credit is given to the player.

== Behavior ==
The mob is permanently idle. It spectates the warden boss fight and makes comments throughout the encounter. It is immune to all forms of damage from [[Survival]] players but can be killed by a [[Creative]] player. It does not fall if the block beneath it was destroyed.

While in the arena, spectator witches make sounds such as starting calls or cheers as they observe the player’s encounter with the warden after it has been awakened. They cheer again when the player defeats the warden.

Like regular witches, spectator witches have a chance to drink a potion of Fire Resistance when set on fire and a potion of Healing when not at full health.
