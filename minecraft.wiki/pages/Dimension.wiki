{{about|the explorable dimensions accessible within the game|the definition of dimensions in data packs|Dimension definition}}

'''Dimensions''' are parallel worlds within a ''Minecraft'' [[world]] characterized by a way of generation, biomes and structures, and other things unique to one dimension. Each dimension is its own separate 3D space, not affecting other dimensions. Players can explore and discover various dimensions in ''Minecraft'', typically through the use of [[portal]]s. With the addition of [[data pack]]s, players can make [[custom dimension]]s to explore in ''Minecraft''.{{only|java}}

The [[daylight cycle]] and [[weather]] may work differently or not exist in different dimensions, as well as respawn points (such as [[bed]]s and [[respawn anchor]]s).

== Overworld ==
[[File:1.18 terrain.png|alt=|thumb|A small mountain and River biome in the Overworld.]]
{{Main|Overworld}}
The Overworld is the primary dimension in ''Minecraft''. It has a wide variety of unique [[biome]]s to explore, and is easily the most diverse of the dimensions. Players typically spend most of their time in this dimension.

Unique features of the Overworld include:

* Sleeping in a bed skips the night and sets spawn point (explodes when used in other dimensions).
* The most biomes of any dimension.
* Surface and underground biomes.
* [[Ocean]]s containing [[water]].
* The most amount of [[ore]]s.
* Many naturally [[generated structures]].
* The most types of [[mob]]s.
* A [[daylight cycle]].
* [[Weather]].
* A total [[altitude|vertical height]] of 384 blocks, as opposed to 256 blocks for other dimensions.

== The Nether ==
[[File:Nether.png|thumb|The [[Nether wastes]] biome in The Nether.]]
{{Main|The Nether}}
The Nether (known as DIM-1 in the files) is a hot dimension where [[lava]] flows equivalent to water's flow characteristics. It is so hot that [[water]] evaporates and [[wet sponge]]s dry out the instant they are {{control|placed}}. The ground mainly consists of [[netherrack]], but [[soul sand]] covers the surface of [[soul sand valley]]s, and the [[basalt delta]]s consist of [[basalt]] and [[blackstone]]. A player can go to the Nether by entering a [[Nether portal]] in the [[Overworld]]. In most biomes, hostile mobs spawn and attack players, although in the [[warped forest]] only [[endermen]] spawn who don't attack players unless provoked.

Unique features of the Nether include:

* Using a respawn anchor sets spawn point and consumes a charge should death occur (explodes when used in other dimensions).
* Oceans containing lava.
* 1 block pockets of lava
* Cave-like terrain.
* [[Nether quartz ore]], [[Nether gold ore]], and [[ancient debris]].
* A ceiling of [[bedrock]].
* [[Huge fungi]] in the [[crimson forest]]s and [[warped forest]]s.
* [[Fog]] color shifts for certain biomes.
* [[Piglin]]s to [[barter]] with.
* [[Bastion remnant]]s guarded by [[piglin brute]]s.
* [[Nether fortress]]es guarded by [[wither skeleton]]s and [[blaze]]s.

== The End ==
[[File:The End.png|thumb|The central island of the End.]]
{{Main|The End}}
The End (known as DIM1 in the files) is a space-like dimension with floating [[End stone]] islands, accessible with an [[End portal]] in a [[stronghold]]. In its center, there is a large lone island on which the [[ender dragon]] fight takes place; the outer islands are about a thousand blocks of void away from it. The End is a barren environment, but it is the place where some of the most unique and useful items in the game can be obtained, such as the [[elytra]] or [[shulker box]]es.

Unique features of the End include:

* Almost no bedrock.
* Direct access to the [[void]].
* Fire burning indefinitely on [[bedrock]].
* [[End crystal]]s igniting the block they're placed on fire.
* Floating islands of [[End stone]].
* No ores.
* [[End flash]]es.
* [[End cities]] guarded by [[shulker]]s.
* [[End gateway]]s to access the outer islands.
* One of the main [[boss]]es in the game, the [[ender dragon]].

== Custom dimensions ==

{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}
{{Main|Custom dimension}}
Using [[data pack]]s, it is possible to create custom dimensions and [[dimension type]]s that have different [[biome]]s, world generation and properties from the regular dimensions.

== Unimplemented dimensions ==
[[File:Sky Dimension 1.jpg|thumb|A view of the unimplemented Sky Dimension.]]
=== Sky Dimension ===
{{Main|Sky Dimension}}
The sky dimension was a scrapped dimension that would have contained floating land masses and was planned to be added in the [[Adventure Update]]. Eventually, the code for the sky dimension was repurposed for [[The End]] instead.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|124201530856452096|@JPwanabe It has been rebranded to be The End realm|October 12, 2011}}</ref>

=== Dream Dimension ===
{{Main|Bedrock Edition mentioned features#World generation}}
In a Twitch livestream, the developers briefly mentioned the idea of a "dream dimension" that would be exclusive to [[Pocket Edition]].<ref>{{twl|19541608|Minecraft: Pocket Edition & Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Q&A|Minecraft|October 7, 2015}}</ref>

== Joke dimensions ==
{{Expand section}}
In multiple [[April Fools update]]s, new joke dimensions have been added for those updates only.

=== Infinite dimensions ===
[[File:ShapesBuffet.png|thumb|One of the joke dimensions found in 20w14∞.]]
{{Main|20w14∞}}
In the joke snapshot 20w14∞, about 2.1 billion (2^31) dimensions were added. These only existed in 20w14∞ and these changes were not kept in later snapshots. There were also several easter egg dimensions, each having their own unique feature, including the ant dimension, the sponge dimension, the library dimension, the bridges dimension, the isolation dimension, the slime dimension, and the skygrid dimension. The other dimensions were completely random.

=== The Moon ===
[[File:Moon 1.png|thumb|A [[lunar base]] in the moon dimension.]]
{{Main|The Moon}}
In [[23w13a or b]], there is a dimension called [[the Moon]]. The Moon dimension is primarily made of [[cheese]] and features a mob called the [[moon cow]]. The Moon also features [[lunar base]]s which expand into a tree-like structure when activated.

=== Potato Dimension ===
[[File:Arboretum.png|thumb|The [[arboretum]] biome in the Potato dimension.]]
{{Main|Poisonous Potato Dimension}}
In [[24w14potato]], the Potato dimension was added. It is similar to the unused Sky dimension, and features many potato-themed mobs, blocks, structures, and a [[Mega Spud|boss]].
