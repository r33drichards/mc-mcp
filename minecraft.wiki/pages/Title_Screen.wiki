The '''title screen''' or '''main menu''' is the first of ''[[Minecraft]]''<nowiki/>'s several [[menu screen]]s. Acting as an introductory interface, it permits access to gameplay and most other menu screens.

The game's [[logo]] is prominently displayed on the title screen, accompanied with a randomly-selected [[splash]], and is also backed with a [[panorama]] which is changed every [[named update]] to match its theme. The version number and copyright are shown at the bottom of the screen.

=== Minceraft ===
<!-- This section is about a joke misspelling that's in the game. Don't change it. -->
{{redirect|Minceraft|the game|Minecraft}}
[[File:MainMenu Minceraft.png|thumb|The Minceraft Easter egg, as of {{v|java}}.]]

There is a 0.01% ({{frac|1|10000}}) chance for the title screen to display "Minceraft" instead of "[[Minecraft]]".<ref>{{bug|MC-44089|||WAI}}</ref> [[Notch]] implemented this as an [[Easter egg]], and kept it as a small secret, enjoying that he was the only one who knew of its existence. After stating a secret was in ''Minecraft'' undiscovered, the community sought to find it. Soon after, Notch posted "a post-mortem of Minceraft" on Reddit.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/qqenq/minceraft_a_post_mortem/|title=Minceraft, a post mortem|website=Reddit|author=[[Markus Persson]]|date=10 March 2012}}</ref>

Additionally, in [[Crash|crash logs]], a reference to Minceraft may appear as a joke, stating "You should try our sister game, Minceraft!"

Getting ''Minceraft'' can be simulated by replacing the minecraft.png file with the minceraft.png file. The texture file is located in <code>[[textures]]/gui/title/minceraft.png</code>.

=== Welcome to Minecraft ===
[[File:Welcome to Minecraft.png|thumb|The Welcome to Minecraft screen as of {{v|java}}.]]
When the user enters the game the first time, a Welcome to Minecraft screen appears. The welcome text is narrated on startup. This screen can also be viewed by deleting the <code>[[options.txt]]</code> file.

The buttons are:
{| class="wikitable" border="1" data-description="Java Edition Welcome buttons"

Pressing {{Keys|Esc}} opens a menu with a button to close the game.

[[In-game live event|In-game live events]] or certain other events are sometimes available to join from the main menu with a button on the middle-left.
[[File:Play your way.png|thumb|width=150x150|Example of a pop-up. This one is usually shown the second time after installing the game.]]
The first and second times after installing the game, and during certain events, a pop-up is shown on the main menu. Pop-ups can inform new players about the game, announce updates, news from official Marketplace collaborations, or [[Marketplace Pass]] updates. Most pop-ups can also be found in the inbox afterward.

=== Inbox ===
[[File:Ore UI - Inbox Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The Inbox screen.]]
The '''Inbox''' is an in-game message center accessible from the main menu when signed in. Messages are sorted into five tabs: News, Invites, Realms, Marketplace Pass, and Feedback. News messages include updates, events, and some announcements, usually also shown on pop-ups. Realms and Marketplace Pass messages are often related to new content in the Marketplace Pass, when content becomes unavailable, and some announcements. The feedback tab shows external links to the [[feedback site]].

These messages are sent by ''Minecraft'', and may be delayed for certain regions. Messages are synced to the player's Xbox account and saved forever, although individual messages can be deleted. Each message can be opened to show the full content and images, and some also contain external links or buttons to Marketplace packs.

In the Invites tab, Realms invites from players are shown. Any player can send invites to players they have added as friends, which doesn't need to be confirmed. Accepting the invite adds the Realm to the play screen; declining the invite removes the option to accept and requires a new invite to be sent.

The inbox has a few settings accessible with a button on the top-right.

=== Quick world creation ===
[[File:Get started title screen (Bedrock).png|thumb|The "Get started" main menu.]]
Upon opening ''Minecraft'' for the first time after installing, a variant of the main menu opens with an interface to quickly create a new world. The player can choose to create a new world with the options to select the [[game mode]] and the [[difficulty]], while all other [[World Options|world options]] remain in their default state. The player can then choose one of the nine [[default skins]] and select the touch [[Controls|control]] mode when playing on a touch device.
