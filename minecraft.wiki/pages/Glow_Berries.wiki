'''Glow berries''' are a [[food]] item obtained from cave vines and can be used to plant them.

'''Cave vines''' are a climbable plant that hangs off ceilings and grows glow berries. Cave vines with glow berries produce [[light]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A cave vine can be broken by hand or with any tool, yielding one unit of glow berries if the vine is bearing berries or nothing when it is not. This is ''not'' affected by [[Fortune]]. A cave vine also breaks if its support block is removed, if [[water]] runs over its location, or if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, yielding the same drops as if broken by a player.

{{Breaking row|Cave Vines, Cave Vines Plant|link=none|horizontal=1}}

=== Harvesting ===
One unit of glow berries can also be collected from cave vines bearing berries without breaking the plant. This is done by pressing the {{control|use}} control on the vine, either by hand or while holding any item.

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Cave vines (feature)}}
Cave vines can be found in [[lush caves]], hanging from the ceilings of the caves.

{{block distribution}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|glow-berries}}

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Glow berries can be placed on and grown from the bottom of most blocks (any block whose bottom face covers the bottom of the entire block). They can also be placed on the bottom of a cave vine, extending the stack of vines by 1 block. They have no specific lighting requirements.

=== Growth ===
Placing glow berries on the bottom of a block creates a cave vine that grows downward one block at a time when [[Random tick|random-ticked]]. There is a 10% chance of growing on random tick. At default random tick speed, a cave vine grows approximately every {{convert|13653|tick|minute}}. When the vine grows, the <code>age</code> value of the bottom-most block is increased by 1. Cave vines stop growing once they reach the floor (any non-[[air]] block) or when the bottom-most block reaches an <code>age</code> block state of 25, whichever is first, so a new vine block can grow up to <code>25 - age</code> blocks further. Cave vines also stop growing if [[shears]] are {{control|used}} on the bottom block of the stack.

Using [[bone meal]] on a cave vine block does not grow a new vine block, unlike kelp, twisting vines or weeping vines.

=== Farming ===
Each newly-grown cave vine block has an 11% chance of bearing glow berries. Therefore, cave vines have a 1.1% chance of growing a berry-bearing vine when random-ticked, at an interval of approximately 124121 game ticks (103.434 minutes) at default random tick speed. Glow berries naturally grow only on a newly produced cave vine; existing cave vines blocks do not naturally grow berries over time, unlike [[sweet berry bush]]es.

{{control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on any block of a cave vine causes it to grow glow berries, if it was not already bearing them. [[Bee]]s that carry pollen can also fertilize a cave vine block and grow berries in the block they fly over.

=== Food ===
To eat glow berries, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|2}} [[hunger]] and 0.4{{only|je|short=1}} / 1.2{{only|be|short=1}} hunger [[saturation]], like [[sweet berries]].

=== Climbing ===
Cave vines can be climbed by standing in them and holding the {{control|jump}} key. If there is a solid block behind the cave vines, the {{control|walk forwards}} key can also be used.

=== Light ===
When bearing glow berries, cave vines give off a [[light]] level of 14.

=== Composting ===
Placing glow berries into a [[composter]] by {{control|using}} them on it has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Glow berries can be fed to [[fox]]es to [[breed]] them.

Glow berries can be {{control|used}} on baby foxes to reduce the time until they grow by 10%.
