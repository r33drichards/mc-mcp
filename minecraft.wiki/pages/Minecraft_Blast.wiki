== Gameplay ==
=== Levels ===
{{main|Levels (Blast)}}
Level gameplay is nearly identical to that of mobile games such as ''[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toon-blast/id1176027022 Toon Blast]'', and similar to ''[[w:Candy_Crush_Saga|Candy Crush]]'', also made by King. Within each level, random assortments of differently colored blocks constantly drop into empty spaces. Some levels have less colors of blocks than others. The player can tap on a group of two or more of the same-colored blocks to break them. Given amounts of various ''Minecraft''-themed blocks must be destroyed by breaking blocks adjacent to them within the provided number of moves.

=== Tasks ===
{{main|Tasks (Blast)}}
The player progresses by creating new preset buildings in the current location, called tasks. Sometimes, the player can choose between three different options when building. Between most builds, there is a cutscene. Completing tasks costs energy, which can only be obtained from winning levels. Once everything in a location is completed, the player can move on in their Journey. Sometimes, the player will speak, or a villager will talk to them using symbols.

=== Blocks ===
{{main|Blocks (Blast)}}
Blocks are the main components of each level and are used to destroy, clear or collect blockers by tapping on matching blocks that are next to the blockers.

Different numbers of colored blocks will create different boosters, which can be used for different purposes, where tapping or swiping them to activate will use a move.[[File:MCB Gameplay.png|thumb|200px|Gameplay from Minecraft Blast, featuring potions, zombies, and leaves.]]

=== Boosters ===
{{main|Boosters (Blast)}}

Boosters are stockable power-ups that can be obtained through gameplay. Some boosters can be activated before a level to start a level with the boosters' corresponding special items while others can be used in-level. They can also be made by matching specific numbers of the same colored block.

=== Blockers ===
{{main|Blockers (Blast)}}
Various blocks, items, and mobs function as blockers, obstructing matches and creating obstacles. More types of blockers are introduced as the player progresses through the levels. Up to 4 different types of blockers can appear in a level. 

* Dirt blocks, broken upon breaking an adjacent block.
* Apples: broken upon breaking an adjacent block. They can also be dropped in randomly on certain levels.
* Leaves: broken upon breaking an adjacent block. Some pre-determined leaves can turn into other blockers when broken.
* Sheep: sheared upon breaking an adjacent block, instantly regrowing wool. After enough wool is collected to satisfy requirements, all sheep in the level disappear.
* Zombies: spawn only in zombie lairs which are inaccessible to blocks. After every move, zombies will move in the direction they are facing until they reach a wall of their lair or another zombie, where they will face the opposite direction. When a block adjacent to a zombie from outside of a lair is broken, the zombie is killed. Zombies can spawn wearing a helmet, which allows them to be damaged a certain number of times without dying. Leather helmets break after one hit, golden helmets break after two.
* Bookshelves: take up four blocks, in a 2 by 2 formation. When any side of a bookshelf is damaged, one layer of books is removed. If multiple sides are damaged at the same time, multiple layers are removed. There are 8 layers of books in each.
* Glass: glass covers other blocks, and it is treated as if it wasn't there, with all blockers and blocks filing into it as normal. It is only broken when the block under it is broken.
* Chickens: only collected when reaching the bottom of the level screen.
* Spiders: when doing an action, the spider moves to another block
* Creepers: destroying a block near a creeper, it’ll start the explosion animation, meanwhile if you destroy another block near it it’ll explode destroying the blocks in the explosion area
* Obsidian: it can only be destroyed by special blocks as rockets, tnts etc…
* Rug: it needs a certain amount of destroyed blocks of a specificated color. When completed it’ll show the blocks under it
* Flower pots: broken when an adjacent block of the same block is broken
