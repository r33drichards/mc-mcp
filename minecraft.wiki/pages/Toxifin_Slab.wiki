A '''toxifin slab''', also known as simply '''toxifin''', is a modified version of the [[guardian]] with an orange body and green spikes, available in [[24w14potato]]. It has the same width and length, but half the height as a guardian.

== Spawning ==
Toxifin slabs spawn naturally in the [[Potato dimension]]. They frequently spawn in the [[wasteland]] biome, as well as inside of a [[colosseum]]. Each colosseum spawns a large number of toxifins upon generation, and there are four [[monster spawner]]s under the central platform, which also spawn toxifins. Even after destroying spawners and killing all initially generated toxifins, more of them still seem to spawn in the structure, although not very frequently.{{more info needed|what are the exact conditions on spawning?}}

|notes=
toxic_resin_lore_clouded = Clouded clarity with fishy impurities.

}}

Toxifins also drop {{xp|5}} when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

== Behavior ==
Toxifins wander aimlessly when no enemies are around. They can either swim in water, or jump around on land. When nearby other toxifins, they may stack on top of each other. Stacking can occur multiple times. They may dismount each other naturally, and always dismount upon taking damage. They can also dismount boats and minecarts in the same way.

Toxifins attack by sending out a beam directed at their target. The beam constantly inflicts [[Poison]] for 1 second until charged, when it adds [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] for 2 seconds.

In addition to attacking players, toxifins also attack squid, glow squid and axolotls. Snow golems, iron golems and axolotls attack toxifins. Toxifins don't get angry at entities that attack them, this includes players and axolotls if they are distracted by another entity.

When a toxifin takes melee damage from another entity, it inflicts 2 seconds of Wither. This also applies to players in Creative.

== Sounds ==
Toxifin slabs use the Hostile Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].
