* <code>minecraft:spawns_on_block_prevented_filter</code> now supports block descriptors.
* <code>minecraft:spawns_above_block_filter</code> now supports block descriptors.

'''[[Molang]]'''
* Added new Molang API’s that give read access to rider body and head rotations:

** <code>ride_body_y_rotation => float</code>
** <code>ride_head_x_rotation => float</code>
** <code>ride_head_y_rotation(clampRotation?) => float</code>
* <code>surface_particle_color</code>, <code>query.surface_particle_texture_coordinate</code>, and <code>query.surface_particle_texture_size</code> are now versioned with <code>1.20.70</code> to allow the three queries to see leaf blocks as the surface texture below the block.
* Released <code>query.is_attached</code> and <code>query.has_player_rider</code> from experimental.
* Removed experimental Molang queries <code>query.get_ride</code> and <code>query.get_riders</code>.
* Released Molang <code>query.scoreboard</code> for use with behavior packs from experimental. (resource packs will return 0)

'''[[NBT]] Parsing'''
* Loading of NBT data is now more restrictive. Negative-length arrays, invalid tag ids, and not enough bytes in a payload are now all treated as errors which will prevent a tag loading where before those conditions were sometimes ignored.

'''Other'''
* Custom armor trim patterns can now be defined and applied to custom armor items.
** Armor trim patterns on custom armor requires a <code>format_version</code> of <code>1.20.60</code> or higher for the attachable and item.
