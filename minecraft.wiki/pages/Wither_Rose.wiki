A '''wither rose''' is a damaging [[flower]] that drops when a [[mob]] is killed by a [[wither]].

== Obtaining ==
Unlike with other one-block-tall flowers {{in|Bedrock}}, players cannot spread wither roses on top of nearby grass blocks by applying [[bone meal]] on a wither rose.

=== Breaking ===
A wither rose can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A wither rose also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if the block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

=== Mob loot ===
Any [[mob]] killed by the [[wither]] drops one wither rose upon death. If possible, the wither rose is placed on the [[block]] where the mob died. If the flower cannot be placed there, or if the [[game rule]] {{cd|mob_griefing}} is set to {{cd|false}}, the flower is dropped as an [[item (entity)|item]] instead. Wither roses are dropped even when the game rule {{cd|mob_drops}} is set to {{cd|false}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-154922||Wither roses drop even if {{cd|mob_drops}} is set to {{cd|false}}}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-73842||Wither roses drop even if {{cd|mob_drops}} is set to {{cd|false}}}}</ref>

{{IN|java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up wither roses, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

== Usage ==
Like most flowers, wither roses can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]. They can also be planted on [[netherrack]] or [[soul sand]]. {{IN|java}}, wither roses can also be planted on [[soul soil]].

=== Damaging ===
When not in [[Peaceful]] difficulty, wither roses inflict the [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect to any [[player]]s or non-immune [[mob]]s touching it, dealing {{hp|1}} damage every half second. The effect lingers for 1 second after the player/mob leaves its [[block]] space. [[Wither skeleton]]s, the [[wither]], and the [[ender dragon]] are not affected because they are immune to the Wither effect.

When placed in a flower pot, wither roses do not cause damage to any entity. {{IN|bedrock}}, when a wither rose is [[snowlogged]], it does not emit particles and does not hurt entities.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-61608||Wither rose in snow emits no particles and deals no damage}}</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a wither rose imparts the {{EffectLink|link=Wither (effect)|Wither}} effect for 7 seconds, dealing {{hp|3}} damage. It can be crafted using a wither rose or produced by feeding a wither rose to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Mob spawning ===
[[Wither skeleton]]s and [[zombified piglins]]{{only|BE}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-162247||Zombified piglins can spawn inside wither roses}}</ref> are the only mobs that can spawn on wither roses, given their spawning requirements are met.

=== Bees ===
As with other mobs, when a [[bee]] touches a wither rose on any [[difficulty]] other than Peaceful, it is inflicted with the [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect. Despite this, bees still attempt to pollinate wither roses and succeed if the difficulty is set to Peaceful.<ref>{{bug|MC-159396||Bees target wither roses and die|WAI}}</ref>

Wither roses can be used to lead bees, but cannot be used to breed them or grow baby bees. Feeding a bee a wither rose inflicts it with the [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect for {{convert|2|second|game tick}}, without angering the bee.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a wither rose have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a wither rose into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of wither roses yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

== Issues ==

== Trivia ==
* Wither roses deal the same damage while in contact (and a second more) as [[magma block]]s, via the [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect.
* The rarity of wither roses is Common, despite the fact that a rare item (the [[wither skeleton skull]]) is required to encounter them in the first place.<ref>{{bug|MC-277942||Wither rose is Common, despite requiring Rare items to obtain}}</ref>
