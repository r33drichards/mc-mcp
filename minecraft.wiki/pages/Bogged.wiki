A '''bogged''' is a [[mushroom]]-covered [[skeleton]] variant that spawns in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s. Bogged behave similarly to skeletons, but have less [[health]], fire their [[bow]]s more slowly, take damage from [[powder snow]], cannot convert to [[stray]]s, and shoot [[tipped arrow]]s of [[Poison]].

== Spawning ==
Bogged can [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s, replacing about 30% of [[skeleton]]s, as well as in [[trial chambers]] via [[trial spawner]]s.

=== Natural spawning ===
* {{IN|java}}, they spawn in groups of four at a light level of 0 and can spawn both underground and above ground.

* {{IN|bedrock}}, they spawn in groups of 1--2 at light levels 0 through 7, meaning they can spawn during the day in [[mangrove swamp]]s where the overhead canopy is dense enough, but they cannot spawn underground.
<!-- The 0--7 light level is NOT a leftover from some old wiki page. 1.21.0 spawn_rules/bogged.json contains this:
        "minecraft:spawns_on_surface": {
        },
        "minecraft:brightness_filter": {
          "min": 0,
          "max": 7,
          "adjust_for_weather": true
        },
-->
{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Trial spawners ===
Bogged have a {{frac|1|3}} chance to be selected as the "ranged" mob for trial spawners in [[Trial Chambers|trial chambers]].

=== Spider jockeys ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}[[Spider]]s and [[cave spider]]s spawned in swamps and mangrove swamps have a 1% chance to spawn as a [[spider jockey]], with an 80% chance of the rider being a bogged.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Bone|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Arrow|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Arrow of Poison|notes=player_or_pet|quantity=0-1|lootingquantity=0-1|limit=1}}
}}
* Naturally spawned equipment is damaged when dropped. An [[enchant]]ed [[bow]] has an 8.5% chance of dropping if killed by the [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]] (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III). The equipment list is identical to that of the base [[Skeleton]]<!-- At least in Bedrock, it is. The 1.21.0 json line for equipment is literally "table": "loot_tables/entities/skeleton_gear.json" -->.
** Bogged spawned from [[ominous trial spawner]]s do not drop their armor on death.
* Picked-up items always drop and drop with the same damage level it had when picked up.
* {{xp|5}} [[experience]] orbs when killed by a [[player]] or a [[tamed wolf]], and an extra {{xp|1|3}} orbs for each piece of natural equipment that ''does not'' drop upon death.
** Because all bogged spawn with at least a [[bow]], this means that an unarmored bogged drops {{xp|6|8}} if it does not drop its bow upon death.

=== Shearing ===
A bogged drops 2 [[mushroom]]s when [[shear]]ed. Each individual mushroom has an equal chance of dropping as either a [[Brown Mushroom|brown]] or [[red mushroom]]. Afterward, it cannot be sheared again, and the mushrooms growing from its head are permanently removed from the bogged.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Bogged Attacking Screenshot.png|thumb|A bogged attacking the player.]]
Bogged behave the same as normal [[Skeleton|skeletons]] and shoot [[tipped arrow]]s that inflict [[Poison]] for 4 seconds (dealing {{hp|poisoned=1|3}} [[damage]]) on any target that they hit. When shooting their [[bow]], bogged are just as fast as skeletons or [[stray]]s, but bogged have a longer cooldown between attacks. The cooldown is 3.5 seconds on Easy and Normal [[difficulties]], or 2.5 seconds on Hard. This is 1.5 seconds slower than the skeleton's attack [[cooldown]]. A bogged holding a [[tipped arrow]] or [[spectral arrow]] in its off-hand always shoots that type of arrow instead, and the [[arrow]] held is not consumed.

Unlike regular skeletons, bogged in [[powder snow]] take freezing [[damage]] and do not convert into [[Stray|strays]].<ref>{{bug|MC-268579||Bogged in powder snow freeze on death instead of converting to Stray|WAI}}</ref>

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] [[enchantment]].
* Unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

As they are also under the "skeletons" [[entity type tag]], if a bogged kills a [[creeper]], the creeper drops a [[music disc]], randomly selected from [[Music Disc 13|13]], [[Music Disc cat|cat]], [[Music Disc blocks|blocks]], [[Music Disc chirp|chirp]], [[Music Disc far|far]], [[Music Disc mall|mall]], [[Music Disc mellohi|mellohi]], [[Music Disc stal|stal]], [[Music Disc strad|strad]], [[Music Disc ward|ward]], [[Music Disc 11|11]], and [[Music Disc wait|wait]].

The eyes of bogged are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]], similar to strays and [[parched]].
