[[File:22w45a hanging_signs.png-atlas.png|thumb|hanging_signs.png-atlas in [[22w45a]], the last version to produce this file.]]

<samp>'''hanging_signs.png-atlas'''</samp> was a procedurally-generated [[texture atlas]] used to store textures for all [[hanging sign]]s.

== Format ==
It contained all hanging sign textures. However, it is unknown if it was actually used for rendering hanging signs; in the same version in which this atlas was introduced, all of the existing hanging sign textures were also added to <samp>[[signs.png-atlas]]</samp>.{{info needed|can we confirm which of the two atlases was used?}}

==== Mipmapped versions ====
Minecraft would also generate mipmapped versions of this atlas, for unknown reasons. They were not used by the game at all - only blocks placed in the world which use the json model system use mipmapped textures.
