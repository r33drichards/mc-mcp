** Occurs when multiple illager captains are killed.
** The player only get one Bad Omen level at a time from killing a captain.
* Each person that brings Bad Omen into the village leads to additional waves of raids.

'''[[Raid]]s'''
* All waves have now been rebalanced, with certain waves focusing on certain mobs, and early waves becoming less easy.
* Now follow a set pattern of waves based on difficulty (Easy is three waves, Normal is five waves, and Hard is seven waves).
* A bonus wave is added for every additional level of Bad Omen brought into a village, equivalent to the final base wave.
* Higher level of Bad Omen means higher chance that enemies have enchanted weapons.
* Raids now end with a "Victory" or "Defeat" message.

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Following a controversy over statements made by [[Notch]] on Twitter, the following splashes referencing him were removed:
** "Made by Notch!"
** "The Work of Notch!"
** "110813!"
