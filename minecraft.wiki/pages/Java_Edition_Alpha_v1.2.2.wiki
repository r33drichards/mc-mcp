'''Alpha v1.2.2''' is the name given to three versions of [[Java Edition Alpha]] released on November 10, 2010.<ref>From this version's <code>.jar</code> files. The times are 15:24 and 18:38 UTC, respectively</ref> Server version [[Alpha server 0.2.4|0.2.4]] was released with this version, which mainly fixed bugs.

Two versions are available in the [[launcher]], [[#Debugging version|'''Alpha v1.2.2a''']] (a debug version) and '''Alpha v1.2.2b''' (which added support for more animations as well as minor changes and fixes).

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''General'''
* Support for more animation settings.
* Support for 16×16 [[texture pack]]s.
** Prior to this update, users would need to manually change the texture packs by overwriting the <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> image in <samp>[[minecraft.jar]]</samp> files, or use a patcher.

== Changes ==

=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Lava JE11.gif|32px]] [[Lava]]'''
* Now flows 8 blocks in [[the Nether]]. Prior to this update, lava flowed the same distance as it does in [[Overworld|the Overworld]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* It now takes longer for the "took too long to log in" screen to appear when connecting to a server.

=== General ===
'''[[Main menu]]'''
* Now contains the [[texture pack]] selection menu for easy texture pack switching, replacing the "play tutorial level" button.
* Displays the version name in the top-left corner.

== Fixes ==
'''5 bugs fixed'''
* Players and mobs on fire, in lava, or next to cacti no longer plays the hurt sound every [[tick]].
* Getting hit with a higher damage while recovering from a smaller one works as intended.
* Duplicating buttons when resizing screens fixed.
* Zombie pigmen and ghasts no longer get hurt by fire and lava.
* Fixed volume sliders not saving properly.</onlyinclude>

== Debugging version ==
'''Alpha v1.2.2a''' added generation of a [[nether portal]] using {{key|F4}}.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Original-pack.jpg|thumb|alt=|Pack.png as it appears in this version.]]
* {{mono|pack.png}}, the image that is present when a texture pack has no default image, was generated in this version with the seed <code>3257840388504953787</code>.<ref>{{ytl|wZGPg6Ckp3Q|Oh look, a hill!|Earthcomputer|September 5, 2020}}</ref>
* Shortly before the update released, "texture packs" were going to be called "skins."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101112023901/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1525944516/an-update-is-coming-tomorrow An update is coming tomorrow] – The Word of Notch, November 9, 2010</ref> While they were called texture packs in-game, the change log for this update refers to them as both "skin packs" and "texture packs."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101114065053/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1534664976/minecraft-alpha-v1-2-2-minecraft-server-0-2-4 Minecraft Alpha v1.2.2, Minecraft Server 0.2.4] – The Word of Notch, November 10, 2010</ref>
