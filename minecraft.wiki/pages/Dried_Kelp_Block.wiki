'''Dried kelp blocks''' are storage [[block]]s equivalent to nine [[dried kelp]]. They can also be used as [[fuel]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Dried kelp blocks can be [[breaking|mined]] using any [[tool]] or by hand, but a [[hoe]] is the fastest way to break it.

== Usage ==
Dried kelp blocks can be used to store dried kelp in a compact fashion.

Unlike [[hay bale]]s, dried kelp blocks cannot be placed in every orientation, despite both being bundled dried plant matter and using the same type of model.

=== Fuel ===
Dried kelp blocks can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, [[blast furnace]]s, and [[smoker]]s. It is able to smelt 20 items, taking 4,000 ticks in a furnace, and 2,000 ticks in the blast furnace and smoker. This is 2.5 times the burn duration of [[coal]] and [[charcoal]], and 0.25 times the burn duration of a [[block of coal]]. It is the fuel with the highest number of operations per fuel below 64 items. The highest number of items that can be smelted without any refills or [[hopper]]s and without loss of fuel is 60 items (3 dried kelp blocks).

Crafting a dried kelp block first requires smelting 9 pieces of [[kelp]], so its net fuel value is only 11 items. However, using a different fuel source to smelt pieces of kelp that are then crafted into dried kelp blocks, the number of operations per fuel is effectively increased. If a [[lava bucket]] were used to smelt 100 pieces of kelp that were then crafted into 11 dried kelp blocks, which can then smelt a total of 220 items, giving the [[lava Bucket]] a net increase of 120 items smelted. [[Campfire]]s can be used to cook the kelp without using up fuel.

=== Composting ===
Dried kelp blocks have a 50% chance of increasing the compost level in a [[composter]] by 1. Composting a dried kelp block instead of 9 kelp items (whether raw or dried) is less efficient. For example, 100 dried kelp blocks would yield 7 {{frac|1|7}} bone meal on average, while 900 kelp items needed to make them in the first place would instead yield 38 {{frac|4|7}} bone meal on average.
