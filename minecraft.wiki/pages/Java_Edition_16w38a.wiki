'''16w38a''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on September 20, 2016.<ref name="blogpost_16w38a">https://www.mojang.com/2016/09/minecraft-snapshot-16w38a/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Gamerule]]s'''
* <code>doWeatherCycle</code>
** Determines whether the weather changes.
** Defaults to true.

* <code>maxEntityCramming</code>
** Defaults to 24.
** If one entity tries to push more than 24 other entities, it starts to suffocate. (Note that pushing entities like minecarts also count towards this, although minecarts don't suffocate, mobs or players who push one, do suffocate)
*** The death message is ''(playername) suffocated in a wall''.
** Setting to 0 disables the rule.
** Affects mobs and players only.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
{{Animate|Cobblestone Wall (EWU) JE1 BE1.png;Mossy Cobblestone Wall (EWU) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} '''[[Cobblestone Wall|Cobblestone Walls]] and [[Mossy Cobblestone Wall|Mossy Cobblestone Walls]]'''
* Are now in the "Decoration Blocks" tab in the [[Creative inventory]] rather than the "Building Blocks" tab.

[[File:Farmland JE3 BE3.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Farmland]]'''
* Using {{control|pick block}} gives the player farmland itself instead of [[dirt]].

=== Command format ===
'''[[Target selector]]s'''
* Invalid selectors (such as <code>@e[Type=creeper]</code> instead of <code>@e[type=creeper]</code>, <code>@e[asdf]</code> or <code>@e[foo=nonexistent]</code>) now generate an error instead of being silently ignored.
* Removed implicit target selectors (such as <code>@e[167,28,454]</code>).

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Messages can now be 256 characters long instead of 100.

'''[[Fishing]]'''
* [[Ink sac]]s are now caught in stacks of 10 with a weight of 1, rather than in stacks of 1 with a weight of 10.

=== General ===
'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Walking underwater no longer produces a step sound for the block the player is walking on.<ref group=note name=watersound>It is not known if this was intended or not, but it was later re-added in [[23w18a]].</ref>

=== Items ===
[[File:Water Bottle JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Potion]]s'''
* Potions that have missing or invalid potion-effect tags now default to the uncraftable potion, which now has no glint, and is now magenta in color.
** This also applies to lingering potions, splash potions and tipped arrows.
** Due to the water bottle without tags being changed to uncraftable potion, the brewing icon is also changed to uncraftable potion in the Creative inventory.

[[File:Elytra (item) JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Elytra]]'''
* Visible when equipped on [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s and [[armor stand]]s.

=== Mobs ===
{{Animate|Guardian JE1 BE1.png;Elder Guardian JE1 BE1.png|50px}} '''[[Guardian]]s and [[Elder Guardian|Elder Guardians]]'''
* Their common drop of [[raw fish]] will now be [[cooked fish]] if they die while on fire.
** Their rare drops from player kills, which match [[fishing]] loot and are sometimes fish, are unaffected.

[[File:Brown Rabbit JE1 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Rabbit]]s'''
* Their [[raw rabbit]] drop is now affected by the [[Looting]] enchantment.

{{Animate|Skeleton Horse Revision 1.png;Zombie Horse Revision 1.png|43px}} '''[[Skeleton Horse|Skeleton Horses]] and [[Zombie Horse|Zombie Horses]]'''
* Their [[bone]] and [[rotten flesh]] drops (respectively) now yield 0–2, and are now affected by Looting.
