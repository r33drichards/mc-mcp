A '''sniffer''' is an ancient<ref> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJ2dzVcOgg&t=18</ref> [[passive mob]] that spawns only by hatching from [[sniffer egg]]s. It looks for and digs up [[torchflower]] and [[pitcher plant]] seeds in [[dirt]], [[Grass Block|grass]], and [[moss block]]s.

== Spawning ==
Sniffers spawn by hatching from [[sniffer egg]]s, which can be found in [[suspicious sand]] from [[warm ocean ruins]]. Sniffers cannot spawn naturally. Breeding sniffers with [[torchflower seeds]] can also result in a sniffer egg being laid as an [[Item (entity)|item]].

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
When killed, adult sniffers drop {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] points if it was killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]]. Snifflets, just like other baby animals, do not drop any experience points.

=== Breeding ===
Upon successful breeding, {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Digging sniffer.png|thumb|A digging sniffer.]]
Sniffers wander aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles. They occasionally smell their surroundings and track ancient seeds by pressing their nose to the ground. When they find a seed, they sploot<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=155}}</ref> and use their noses to dig into the ground until they get [[torchflower seeds]] or a [[pitcher pod]], with an equal chance of digging up either one.

A sniffer can only dig if it is on the ground. A sniffer cannot dig when it is leashed, in [[water]], tempted with a torchflower seed, panicking, or in a [[boat]] or [[minecart]]. The block underneath its head must be diggable and reachable by the sniffer. The head location is defined as 2.25 blocks in front of the center of the body. The sniffer also stores its prior 20 digging locations to prevent subsequent digging at those locations. After sniffing out seeds, an eight-minute cooldown is activated before it can search again.

The following blocks are diggable by the sniffer:
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
{{IN|java}}, [[data pack]]s can change this list by modifying the <code>minecraft:sniffer_diggable_block</code> [[Tag#Blocks|block tag]].

Sniffers cannot dig on [[mycelium]].<ref>{{bug|MC-260259||Sniffers cannot dig nor find seeds on mycelium|WAI}}</ref>

=== Breeding ===
A player can [[breed]] sniffers by using [[torchflower seeds]] on two sniffers. {{IN|bedrock}}, only sniffers at full health can breed. When two adult sniffers breed, they drop a [[sniffer egg]] as an item on the ground, and then enter a 5-minute cooldown before they can breed again. Once placed by a player, a sniffer egg hatches after 20 minutes if placed on most blocks, or 10 minutes if placed on a [[moss block]]. 

==== Healing ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, sniffers are healed by {{hp|2}} health points each time they are fed a torchflower seed.

=== Snifflets ===
A baby sniffer is called a '''snifflet'''.<ref>{{Mcnet|sniffer-coming-minecraft-120|Once you’ve unearthed your egg, it’s time to help it hatch! I implore you to pay close attention to this part of the process, because you have not lived until you have seen a '''snifflet''' burst out of its shell.}}</ref> They have a bigger head relative to their body than the adult. Snifflets require 48000 [[game tick]]s to grow up into adult sniffers, which is equal to 40 minutes or two in-game days, twice as long as most other baby mobs in the game. The remaining growth time is reduced by 10% each time a snifflet is fed torchflower seeds.

Snifflets cannot dig.

Unlike most baby mobs, snifflets do not follow the adults.<ref>{{bug|MC-260272||Baby sniffers don't follow adult sniffers|WAI}}</ref>

There is an initial lag period between snifflets growing into adults and splooting for seeds.

== Trivia ==
* According to ''[[Minecraft: Mobspotter's Encyclopedia]]'', Sniffers have feathers and fur.<ref name=book>''[[Minecraft: Mobspotter's Encyclopedia]]'', pg. 41</ref>
* The sniffer was originally a doodle Nekofresa made in their kitchen.<ref>{{Tweet|Nekofresa|1625173791318982667|Soon™ you will finally be able to meet the sniffer! Less than a year ago, this chonky baby was just a doodle made in my kitchen, they are growing so fast 🥺💖✨|February 13, 2023}}</ref> The sniffer was also Nekofresa's first mob ever designed for Minecraft.<ref>{{Tweet|Nekofresa|1625399598670815232|We all brought it to the game! I only did the concept arts, but then the entire team brought it to life 💖 especially the anims|February 14, 2023}}</ref>
* The sniffer's walking animation was inspired by the leg movements of centipedes.<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves @1:21|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=81}}</ref>
* During the prototype phase for the sniffer's digging up of items, the developers used beds as a placeholder.<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves @1:45|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=105}}</ref>
* Due to the size of the sniffer, developers found it challenging to perfect its pathfinding, especially on 1 block edges.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}
* A new team made up of new developers were tasked with developing the sniffer, and most of them had never made a mob before.<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves @2:35|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=155}}</ref>
* The sniffer's digging animation was inspired by the way {{w|corgi}}s spread their legs while lying down. The action is called a "[[w:Splooting|sploot]]".<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves @2:44|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=164}}</ref>
* To this day, the developers still don't know what the sniffer's front yellow part is. Whether it's a beak, a nose, or eyes, or whether it's used for breathing or finding seeds is unknown.<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves @1:09|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=69}}</ref>
* Original ideas for what a baby sniffer would be called were Sniffling, Snort, and Snifflet.<ref>{{ytl|LQGF2EbuhNU|ASK MOJANG - How the sniffer got its name? @0:18|Minecraft|August 21, 2023|t=18}}</ref>
