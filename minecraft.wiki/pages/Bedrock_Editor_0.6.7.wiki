== Additions ==
[[File:Defered Lighting Settings.mp4|300px|right|thumb|Defered Lighting Settings in [[Bedrock Editor]].]]
; Defered Lighting Settings
* Added settings panel to modify atmospheric, global illumination, and color grading settings for deferred lighting
** Requires deferred lighting resource pack and settings to be enabled
** It can be opened in the tool panel by going to View => Deferred Lighting Settings in the top menu.
** After the configuration is finished the settings can be pasted directly into the resource pack by clicking the Export to clipboard button at the bottom of the page.
** Known issues:
*** Shadows are cast from the UI elements. Crosshair mode can be toggles via {{key|ctrl+tab}} as a workaround
*** Paste preview ({{keys|ctrl+shift+V}}) does not render properly when deferred lighting is enabled.

[[File:Custom Input Mapping.png|300px|right|thumb|Custom Input Mapping.]]
; Custom Input Mapping
* Added a tool to allow remapping the shortcuts used by Editor and all Editor Extensions!
** From the Action Bar hit + and then Input Mapping to add the shortcut to your Action Bar. Then hit Input Mapping to open the panel.
* Key bindings can be reconfigured using the shortcut field, which detects key presses to set the binding.
** Pending changes will highlight the text until saved or cleared. Closing the modal reverts any pending changes.
** Right-clicking on a selected shortcut field clears the binding, or clear button next to the field can be used.
* Added a toggle for exclusive ({{cd|InputModifier.None}} in API) key actions to support advanced input scenarios.
* Modified bindings can be restored by clicking restore buttons for the binding, active context, and all modified bindings.
* Saved bindings are accessible across different editor projects.

; Options
* Extended game options to include more export options as well as applying options to export level data.

; API
* Added an optional {{cd|KeyBindingInfo}} argument to the key binding registration API functions to assign additional information to shortcuts.
* Added new {{cd|BlockList}} UI element to Property Pane API.
* Added {{cd|inputContextId}} and {{cd|inputContextLabel}} optional properties to {{cd|ModalToolCreationParameters}} API to represent user defined modal tool identifiers for modal tools.
* Added interface {{cd|KeyBinding}} and modified key binding registration API methods to take this object.
* Added variant: {{cd|ColorPickerVariant optional}} property to {{cd|IPropertyItemOptionsColorPicker}} API to support different types of color picker property items.
** Changed the default variant to respect the pane layout. Moved gradient selector for {{cd|Default}} and {{cd|Inline}} variants to a popup, accessible by clicking the selected color box.

== Changes ==
; UI
* Dropdown menus will attempt to open in the opposite direction when they extend beyond the window bounds.
* Updated set of entities that appear within the Editor picker

These changes have been made in past Previews but did not justify their own Editor version.
