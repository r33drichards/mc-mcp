A version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''March 16, 2010'''.<ref>[[wordofnotch:452455870|State of the Entity]] – The Word of Notch, March 16, 2010</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Steve JE3 BE1.png|32px]] [[Mob (entity)|Mob]]'''
* Re-implemented, though unused.

'''[[File:Steve JE3 BE1.png|32px]] [[Monster (entity)|Monster]]'''
* Unused.
* Appears identical to the "Mob" entity.
* Is hostile, pursuing and attacking the player similarly to how zombies do.
* Invisible in this version.<ref>https://youtu.be/4yTocwdK6NE</ref>

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''General'''
* [[Entities]] are functional again, allowing for broken blocks to [[drop]] resources.
** [[Drop]]s are now working.
** The third-person view now shows the player.
** [[TNT]] can now be primed, but it doesn't explode.

'''[[File:Arrow JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Arrow]]s'''
* Re-implemented.
** Upon hitting (non-[[liquid]]) [[block]]s, arrows have a 100% chance of spawning one of the following [[mob]]s (each with an equal chance): [[sheep]], [[pig]], [[skeleton]], [[creeper]], [[spider]], [[zombie]].
*** On Peaceful [[difficulty]], any "rolls" that land on a [[hostile]] mob instead spawn nothing.<ref>{{ytl|kA7OGtHtqzs|Mob Rave!|Kinjry|March 21, 2010}}</ref>
*** Apply to ''all'' arrows, including ones shot by [[skeleton]]s.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Daylight cycle]]'''
* Daylight cycle now lasts 20 minutes per 1 in-game day.

== Fixes ==

== Bugs ==
'''3 bugs reported'''
* Opening a [[furnace]] and [[chest]] crashes the game.
* Items no longer get pushed out by [[glass]]. (Existed in Indev).
* Mining stone-like blocks whilst breaking a tool (pickaxe only) doesn't drop anything. (Existed in Indev).

== Trivia ==
* The [[al_version]] number of this version is 1.111, but number of [[Java Edition Infdev 20100313|previous version]] is 1.109.
** It might mean that there is a missing version between these, or that there was an [[Wikipedia:LWJGL|LWJGL]] update.
