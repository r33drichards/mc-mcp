A '''vex''' is a small flying [[hostile mob]] that wields an [[iron sword]] and is summoned by [[evoker]]s. It attacks by lunging at its target with its sword and is capable of phasing through walls.

== Spawning ==
The vex only spawns as part of an [[evoker]]'s summoning attack. While summoning, the evoker is surrounded by white [[particles]] and makes a magical, horn-like sound. Then, a group of three vexes appears near the evoker. The evoker can summon additional vexes even if some still remain alive from the last summoning. Blocks obstructing a vex's spawning point will prevent vexes from spawning.

== Drops ==
The vex's [[iron sword]] does not drop, because its main hand's {{cd|HandDropChances}} is {{cd|0}}. This is not affected by the Looting enchantment.

{{xp|5}} is dropped when a vex is killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Vexes attack [[player]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, and any other target as commanded by their summoning evoker (any mob that attacks the evoker accidentally or purposefully){{Only|je|short=je}} or by itself{{Only|be|short=be}}. They still attack these mobs even when they do not have a weapon, dealing the same damage and raising both of its hands when attacking; an unarmed vex can be spawned with this command {{cmd|/summon vex ~ ~ ~ {} }}.{{only|je|short=1}} Vexes summoned by a [[monster spawner]], [[spawn egg]], or by the {{cmd|summon}} command don't attack players unless provoked or already tied with another [[mob]].

If any mob attacks a vex, any vexes in the area become hostile toward it. This includes "Johnny" [[vindicator]]s that attack them, despite both being allied with the illagers.

Vexes are capable of flying through the air, can freely pass through any block, including [[water]] and [[lava]] (without taking damage) and [[bedrock]], meaning they can die in the [[void]]. [[Cobweb|Cobwebs]] cannot slow down vexes, but [[Honey Block|honey blocks]] can{{Only|be|short=be}}. Vexes can be bounced back when pushed by a [[Slime Block|slime block]] with help of any [[piston]].

While attacking, vexes glow red and lunge at their target. They often fly toward the back of their targets and attack from behind, making it difficult to block their attacks with a [[shield]].

Vexes do not count toward the [[bossbar]] during a [[raid]] as they are not considered as raiders by the game.

Vexes summoned by an evoker start taking damage after 30 to 119 seconds and eventually die, even while riding a [[minecart]] or [[boat]]. Vexes summoned by a [[monster spawner]], [[spawn egg]], or by the {{cmd|summon}} command do not take damage this way.

{{IN|je}}, when idle, vexes stay within a 15×11×15 cuboid range centered on their evoker's position when they spawned, unless summoned by a spawn egg or by the {{cmd|summon}} command.

Like [[allay]]s, vexes are completely emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]].

== Trivia ==
* Despite their ghostly appearances and their ability to phase through walls, vexes are not [[undead]] [[mob]]s.
* According to JAPPA, the retexturing and remodeling of vexes was a long time in the making due to being requested so much.<ref>{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1590379143879069697|The Vex model change was requested so much, we planned it a long time ago but could never say anything about it! So happy its out in the open now, I hope you like it. This is the first model revision we've done, so that's very exciting.|November 9, 2022}}</ref>
