{{hatnote|This article is about item rarities in {{MC}}. For rarity in other games, see [[MCE:Rarity]] and [[MCD:Rarity]]. For item rarities in the [[Character Creator]], see [[Character Creator#Rarity]].}}

'''Rarity''' is a statistic applied to [[item]]s and [[block]]s to signify their value and ease in obtaining. Rarity only affects the displayed color of an item name and has no effect on gameplay whatsoever.

There are four rarity tiers: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic. The rarity of an item is generally based on the difficulty of getting it, the time it takes to obtain it and the ingredients used to craft it.

The rarity of an item can be increased by giving it [[enchantment]]s. A Common or Uncommon becomes Rare, and a Rare item becomes Epic. Epic items stay Epic, since that is the maximum rarity. Adding enchantments multiple times does not increase the rarity of an item any further.

== Displaying ==
Rarity is intended to display anywhere the item name does.

It is shown in the following situations:
* Item tooltips in the inventory
* Item tooltips above the hotbar
* Death messages or {{cmd|give}} command in chat{{Only|je|short=1}}

Rarity colors do ''not'' display in the following cases:
* Item tooltips from an [[item frame]]<ref>{{bug|MC-132199}}</ref>
* Contents tooltips from a [[shulker box]]<ref>{{bug|MC-132201}}</ref>
* Item tooltips in the [[statistics]] screen{{Only|je|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-139386}}</ref>
* The CanPlaceOn/CanBreak tags of an item<ref>{{bug|MC-227915|||Invalid}}</ref>
* Item names in the [[Superflat]] customization screen{{Only|je|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-227928|||Invalid}}</ref>

== Tiers ==
According to Mojang, the rarity tier of an item is determined based on the following guidelines:<ref>{{snap|24w33a|August 15, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/28896769176845|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.30.21|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=August 1, 2024}}</ref>
{{quote|
* Items and blocks become more rare depending on the following factors:
** The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops
** The amount of travelling required to obtain it
** The difficulty of any obstacle that must be overcome to obtain it
** The possible amount of that item or block existing in the world
* Any item or block that can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients
** For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity
** Likewise, any crafted item that has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common
}}

The rarity of an item does not necessarily reflect on the actual practical difficulty of obtainment; there exist several incongruities in the system. For example:
* all netherite tools and equipment are considered Common, but the upgrade template required to make them is Uncommon<ref>{{bug|MC-275255}}</ref>
* wither skeleton skulls are the easiest head to obtain, yet are considered Rare, despite all other heads being Uncommon<ref>{{bug|MC-277697}}</ref>
* wither roses are Common, despite requiring wither skeleton skulls to obtain, which are Rare<ref>{{bug|MC-277942}}</ref>

In addition, despite being unobtainable in item form in Survival mode, objects such as [[bedrock]], [[farmland]], [[dirt path]]s, [[budding amethyst]], [[chorus plant]] blocks, [[end portal frame]]s, and several other blocks and items still use the "Common" rarity.

=== Common ===
