A '''wither skeleton skull''' is the [[head]] of a [[wither skeleton]] in the form of a [[block]], which is a rare drop from killed wither skeletons. Three of them can be used to summon a [[wither]], a destructive [[boss mob]] that is the only source of [[Nether star]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of wither skeleton skull.<ref>{{bug|MC-192905||Heads & Skulls have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Wither Skeleton Skull}}
Wither skeleton skull drops itself when it's destroyed.
When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the wither skeleton skull always drops as an item.

=== Mob loot ===
A [[wither skeleton]] has a 2.5% chance of dropping a wither skeleton skull when killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]]. The chance is increased by 1% per level of [[Looting]], for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III. {{IN|bedrock}}, the chance is increased by 2% per level of [[Looting]], for a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III.

A wither skeleton always drops a wither skeleton skull if it dies from a [[charged creeper]]'s explosion. {{IN|bedrock}}, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads;<ref>{{bug|MCPE-18599||Multiple Mob Head Drops from Charged Creeper}}</ref> {{in|java}}, only one mob selected at random drops its head.<ref>{{bug|MC-63534|||WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
Wither skeleton skulls can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to [[sign]]s. They can be placed on top of or beside each other by shift clicking.

=== Wearing ===
{{See also|#Gallery}}

The player can wear wither skeleton skulls, similarly to [[pumpkin]]s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

==== Disguise ====
Unlike some other [[Head|heads and skulls]], wearing a wither skeleton skull does not reduce the detection range for [[wither skeleton]]s.

{{IN|bedrock}}, wearing a wither skeleton skull makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]].

=== Withers ===
{{FakeImage|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|w=Wither Skeleton Skull|s=Soul Sand|www|sss| s }}|Wither build configuration}}

[[Wither]]s can be spawned by placing soul sand or soul soil in a T shape and placing 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the T. The T can be horizontal or vertical, and the last block placed must be one of the three wither skeleton skulls. A dispenser can also create a wither by placing the final wither skeleton skull onto soul sand directly in front of and below it.

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a wither skeleton skull on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

The [[dispenser]] can also complete the construction of a wither by placing wither skeleton skulls unless the [[difficulty]] is set to peaceful.

=== Enchantments ===
Wither skeleton skulls can receive the following enchantments, but only through an [[anvil]].

=== Note blocks ===
Placing a wither skeleton skull above a [[note block]] causes the note block to play the [[wither skeleton]]'s {{cd|ambient}} sound when activated.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Wither skeleton head is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Wither skeleton skulls do not have their own textures; they take their textures from other objects.
* When [[breaking]] any head, the particle effect of breaking it is the same as [[soul sand]].
* {{IN|be}}, the skull variant for the item is stored under the {{cd|damage}} component, normally used for items with [[durability]].
