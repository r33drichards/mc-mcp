When we were prepping the film, he was like, “Look, there's this amazing Minecraft player named Technoblade who passed away, and I would love to be able to honor him somehow in the film.” We were like, “Oh my goodness, of course.” So we spoke with our design team, and there's a really, really sweet, special nod to Technoblade in the film that is really cool.}}</ref>
