=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Creaking Heart.png;Active Creaking Heart.png|32px}} [[Creaking heart]]'''
* A creaking heart is a “living” block generating in pale oak trees, covered on all sides by pale oak wood logs.
* Can be found activated in the [[pale garden]] biome.
* Only activates when placed between two pale oak logs in the same orientation and can't be deactivated unless the block is broken.
** Emits subtle [[Ambience|eerie sounds]] when it is active and surrounded by any types of [[log]]s, [[stripped log]]s, [[wood]], or [[stripped wood]] on all 6 directions.
* Sends a trail of particles towards the connected [[creaking]] when the creaking gets hit by the player or projectiles.
** Particle speed is affected by the distance of the creaking from the heart block.
** Attacking a creaking causes its creaking heart to exude 2 to 3 [[resin clump]]s.
* Mining the block is most efficiently done with an axe, but it only drops when using a [[Silk Touch]] tool.
** When the creaking heart block is destroyed, the connected creaking is removed.
** Naturally placed creaking hearts drop 20-24 experience when broken by a player, with or without Silk Touch.
*** A naturally spawned creaking heart does not drop experience when broken in Creative mode.
** Breaking a creaking heart block drops 1–3&nbsp;resin clumps, and it is affected by [[Fortune]] enchantment.
* Can also be crafted using 2 [[pale oak log]]s and a [[block of resin]].

** Eyeblossoms planted on the ground communicate with each other, helping each other to open or close.
** Open eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night.
** Can be obtained by bonemealing the grass in the pale garden biome or bonemealing an existing eyeblossom.
** [[Bee]]s get poisoned if they are fed eyeblossoms.

''' [[Item model]]s '''
* New format has been introduced for describing item models. See [[Items model definition]].

    <item model type specific fields>
  } 
}</syntaxhighlight>

* Models in {{cd|models/item}} that only redirect to a block model have been removed.
** In such cases, the item model refers to the {{cd|models/block}} model directly.

** {{cd|hand_animation_on_swap}} - boolean field describing if down-and-up animation should be played in first-person view when item stack is changed (either type, count or components)
*** Default: {{cd|true}}

*** {{cd|strings}} - optional list operation of string values.
*** {{cd|colors}} - optional list operation of RGB values or number providers.
** List operation uses same format as explosions field in {{cd|set_fireworks}} modifier.
** For example <syntaxhighlight lang="json">{
  "function": "set_custom_model_data",
  "floats": {
    "values": [2],
    "mode": "replace_all"
  }
}</syntaxhighlight> sets replaces {{cd|floats}} with value {{cd|2}}.

''' [[Missing textures and models]] '''
* If a model which the game uses directly (as opposed to template models) fails to specify a texture to use for particles, an error is now printed to the game log<ref>{{bug|MC-236295}}</ref>.
* If a model does not attempt to route a texture reference to an actual texture file, an error is logged once again<ref>{{bug|MC-276828}}</ref>.

''' [[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]] '''
* {{cd|trail}} particle has a new required field: {{cd|duration}}.
** Indicates, in ticks, how long the particle takes to fly from the start to the target.

''' Protocol '''
* Client now sends the {{cd|minecraft:player_loaded}} packet once the loading terrain screen has closed after initially loading into the world, and after closing the loading screen when respawning.

''' [[Resource pack]] '''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|46}}.
* Added the following new block models and textures:

* Added new armor trim color palette: {{cd|trims/color_palettes/resin}}.
* Invalid {{cd|minecraft:filled_map}} items in an item frame (map item without the {{cd|map_id}} component) no longer change the size of the frame.
* The {{cd|equipment}} directory has been moved one level up, i.e. {{cd|models/equipment/}} becomes {{cd|equipment/}}.
* {{cd|broken_elytra}} model and texture has been renamed to {{cd|elytra_broken}}.
* The UV mapping of the magma cube texture has been updated.
* All blocks that previously rendered only block entity (banners, heads, beds, chests, conduits, decorated pots, shulker boxes and signs) now also render normal block model over it (same as existing behavior of bells, enchantment tables, etc.).
** Rendered block entity still can't be removed or data-driven, this change only affects previously ignored block models.

''' [[Server.jar]] '''
* Data generator in server jar ({{samp|net.minecraft.data.Main}}) no longer generates {{cd|assets}} directory.
** {{cd|--client}} option has been removed from command line for this entry point.
