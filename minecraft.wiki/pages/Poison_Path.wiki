A '''poison path''' is a variant of the [[dirt path]], found in the Potato dimension in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
When mined (even with a [[Silk Touch]] tool), poison path drops only [[terre de pomme]]. It can be obtained in item form only via [[Creative inventory]], [[commands]], or {{control|pick block}}.

=== Natural generation ===
Poison path generates in [[fields]] and [[arboretum]] biomes, as well as in [[potato village]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
{{Control|Using}} a [[shovel]] on [[terre de pomme]], [[peelgrass block]], or [[corrupted peelgrass block]] converts it to poison path.

== Usage ==
Poison path is primarily a decoration block, like normal [[dirt path]]. Because they are {{frac|15|16}} of a block high, items that require a full block like [[torch]]es and [[button]]s cannot be placed on them, and mobs cannot spawn on them.

Poison path converts to terre de pomme instantly if a solid block is placed on top of it.

{{Control|Using}} a [[hoe]] on poison path converts it to [[poison farmland]].
