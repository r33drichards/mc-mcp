The '''penguin''' was a proposed mob featured in the [[2023 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[Minecraft Live 2023]], alongside the [[crab]] and [[armadillo]], having been the first mob to be voted out. It would have spawned in [[stony shore]]s, and would have been amphibious, living both in the [[water]] and on land. Although they were clumsy when walking and fell down occasionally, the penguins were excellent swimmers and could swim as fast as the [[dolphins]]. They gathered in groups.<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-penguin|Mob Vote: Penguin|October 5, 2023|Sophie Austin}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|ZouChenyunfei|1710728806372458512|MOB VOTE NEWS<br><br>The descriptions of Mob Vote 2023 in Minecraft China Edition are a little different, I translated them! <br><br>So maybe we can find something new in these texts: <br>#Minecraft #MinecraftLive #MinecraftMobVote}}</ref>

The penguin could increase the speed of the [[player]]’s [[boat]] on water. It was never confirmed that this ability applied outside of water.

The penguin lost the vote with only 25.2% of the votes.
