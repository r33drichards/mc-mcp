'''''Legend of the Chambered''''' (''LoC''), or simply '''''Chambered''''', is a series of raycaster-styled dungeon crawler games created by [[Markus Persson|Markus "Notch" Persson]] where the player must explore winding stone chambers, fight [[Legend of the Chambered#Enemies|monsters]], and reach the end of the dungeon. There are at least six different versions of ''LoC''. According to Notch's now-deleted project page, he later lost interest in this project and gave up on it,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140708041450/http://www.mojang.com/notch/</ref> though he would go on to make several similar games later.

Along with other similarly titled ''Chambered'' games, ''Legend of the Chambered'' was based on games like ''Dungeon Master'', ''Eye of the Beholder'' and ''Ultima Underworld''. The first ''Legend of the Chambered'' game was made in 2001,<ref name=intraclinic>https://theintraclinic.com/archive/</ref> and the more well known version was released on May 24, 2008,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116044759/http://www.java-gaming.org/index.php?topic=18698.0|title=Legend of the Chambered|website=Java-Gaming.org|date=May 24, 2008}}</ref><ref name=vimeo>{{citation|url=https://vimeo.com/1096320|title=Legend of the Chambered|website=Vimeo|author=K S|date=May 31, 2008}}</ref> with a sequel being released on or before May 3, 2009.<ref>{{citation|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6064.0|title=Legend of the Chambered <nowiki>[early WIP]</nowiki>|website=Tigsource|date=May 3, 2009}}</ref> Notch also created [[wikipedia:Adobe Flash|Adobe Flash]] and [[wikipedia:Android|Android]] versions of ''Legend of the Chambered'', as well as several other similar 3D dungeon crawlers, some of which bore variations of the ''Legend of the Chambered'' or ''LoC'' title, such as '''''Prelude of the Chambered''''' (''PoC''), created for the Ludum Dare 21 game jam in August 2011.

Notch reused many item textures from the 2008 versions of ''Legend of the Chambered'' as textures for items in ''Minecraft'', those being the textures for [[leather armor]], [[studded armor]], [[chainmail armor]], [[iron armor]], [[iron sword]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[quiver]]s, as well as the armor slot sprites. Additionally, [[Mojangles]] was also first used in these games, and ''Minecraft'''s [[inventory]] menu was based on a modified version of the ''LoC'' inventory. The four monster types present in the 2008 versions also bear resemblance to the first four monsters added to ''Minecraft''.

== Story ==

=== ''Legend of the Chambered'' 2008-1 ===
[[File:Legend of Chambered.png|thumb|The starting point in ''Legend of the Chambered 1''.]]
{{Youtube|QPZIEsZBhN8}}

''Legend of the Chambered 1'' begins in a stone chamber with the word "Welcome" written on one wall. There are more winding stone chambers that need to be explored. The player soon finds a small side-room in the hall with a pile of [[Legend of the Chambered#Items%20and%20inventory|equipment]] on the floor, enough for the entire team, with some text above it saying "Loot".

A little further on, there are two slots in the wall with some text in the middle of them saying "Niches". There are other niches scattered throughout the dungeon, but none of them have anything in them, nor can anything be placed in them.

The player finds an intersection; going left, the player finds another, and going left again there is a square loop in which there is a niche in one of the walls. Going the other way there is a roofless room with an automatic wood door to it which continuously opens and closes, and some text on the wall next to it saying "(dancing)". Inside are two apple trees and two monsters. Going right from the first intersection is a room with a hexagonal stone pressure plate in the middle, and two stair wells behind it, one going up and one going down, with some text on a wall between them saying "Stairs". The player can't go up or down these stairs because of an invisible barrier.

There is also another automatic door inside this room which leads to the woods (another roofless room with a maze of trees) as is suggested by some text saying "woods" on a wall somewhere inside it. Another wall on the opposite side has the words "Monsters" and "(dancing)" written on it. There are five monsters roaming around in these woods. Some of the trees have apples growing on them that can be picked by clicking on them, and many of the trees have apples piled underneath.

The player can find their way into another tree-filled room that contains two words, "Win" and "Yay", on opposite walls, and a dynamic texture which shows the time set on one's computer on the middle wall.

=== ''Legend of the Chambered'' 2008-2 ===
[[File:LoC2 Start.png|thumb|The starting point in ''Legend of the Chambered 2''.]]
{{Youtube|7lSk8xfzZig}}

''Legend of the Chambered 2'' begins in a crevasse of stone walls open to the night sky. Equipment is scattered about on the ground, which the player can pick up and use. An opening to the left has studded boots and a leather shirt on the ground. Trees block the way past the opening. The player can either choose to descend the stairway leading down into the dungeon, or to follow a dirt path.

The dirt path further up is lined with trees, and a skeleton wanders its entrance. A holy rune and a copper key can be found here. Further down the path, another skeleton wanders behind a stone block wall. The path then leads to the front of the graveyard, which has three ghosts wandering around in it, and the brick house. A chain helmet can be found here.

Pressing the gray button on the front of the brick house opens up its front wooden door. Inside, behind three more wooden doors, can be found an iron key, a gold key, a copper key, and a jade key. There are also windows on all four sides of the house, that the player and monsters can attack through, but which items cannot be thrown through.

Behind the brick house extends the rest of the graveyard, in which the player can find an earth rune, a water rune, and two coins. A wooden door in the stone wall that surrounds the map opens up to a stone room containing a spider. Inside to the right is another wooden door with windows in the walls on each side. This door opens up to a room with two spiders, a pit, three pressure plates, and a staircase leading to the dungeon.

In the dungeon, two halls lead to the left and right with the staircase at the player's back. The halls meet up again with two wooden doors. Behind each door is a spider and rooms of marble. Each room conjoins into another marble room held up by marble pillars. At the end of the room, there are gravestones. Leaving the dungeon always brings the player back to the starting path no matter which entrance was taken.

=== ''Prelude of the Chambered'' ===
[[File:Prelude Title.png|thumb|An image with the title of ''Prelude of the Chambered'' with one of the enemies, the ogre.]]
{{Youtube|CiKbxbmankE}}

''Prelude of the Chambered'' starts in the Prison, and the player must smash through cracked walls to find a ladder. Going down the ladder leads to the Dungeon, and after exploring a little, the player finds a power glove which lets the player push boulders and fight monsters. After fighting some bats and solving a boulder and pressure plate puzzle, doors open into a room filled with bats and the Golden Bat [[Legend of the Chambered#Bosses|boss]], which, like the other bosses, drops a key.

After that, the player must go back up to the Prison to cut some bars, fight more bats and push two boulders into some holes. This lets them cross to another ladder which leads up to the Island, where there are more bats, along with eyes, and yet another ladder that takes the player down to the Frost Cave. Here they must fight more eyes, and find the skates. The player can also find a green healing potion here too. The skates allow them to move on the ice without sliding, allowing them to get to the Golden Eye boss.

The player can then go back to the Island to cross some ice to obtain Cutters. Going back to the Frost Cave, the player can use the cutters on some bars to obtain a pistol. Going back to the Prison, they can cut more bars and find another pistol and potion in the cells. On the Island, there is a fence of bars with ogres that spit acid behind it, that the player must cut in order to get to the Crypt. In the Crypt, they must fight more ogres, and find the flippers. There is also another potion and pistol behind some cracked walls. The flippers allow them to swim in the water, allowing them to get to the Golden Ogre boss.

Going back to the Island, the player must swim across some water and trap a ghost in a white box to enter the Temple. Here the player must lead ghosts and trap them in some more white boxes in order to cut bars and push buttons to open a door. Pushing a boulder through a hallway and into a hole lets the player pass into a room with another white box in it. Going into the door behind the white box is a room with a maze made out of ghosts.

After finding the Golden Ghost boss, the player must lead it back through the maze to the white box at the beginning in order to get the last key. With all 4 keys collected, the player can go back up to the Island and open up the last door and walk out into a field. The text "YOU WIN", the number of trinkets found (trophies), and the time show up on screen.

== Items and inventory ==

=== ''Legend of the Chambered'' 2008 ===
[[File:LoC pile.png|thumb|A pile of items and the inventory screen.]]
Items are objects that can be picked up, set down, thrown, placed into a character's inventory, and used, though they are unstackable. Each character's inventory consists of 18 item slots and 12 equipment slots (4 slots for armor, 2 for weapons, 2 for rings, an amulet slot, a quiver slot, and 2 power up slots that any item can be placed in), totaling up to 30 inventory slots per character, and 120 slots for the whole party.

The original textures for leather armor, iron swords, apples and quivers can be found in the "items.png" file in the first 2008 version. The original textures for other armors such as studded, chain and iron armor can be found in the "armor.png" file in the second 2008 version.

== Characters ==
[[File:LoC Characters1.png|thumb|A screenshot of all the characters in ''Legend of the Chambered''.]]
The game code in ''LoC'' refers to a character individually as '''Hero''', and collectively as '''Party'''. Both ''PoC'' and the android version of ''LoC'' refer to the player character simply as the '''Player''', which has no sprite or given name. The ''LoC'' game from 2001 contained character portraits from "''{{Wikipedia|The Summoning (video game)|The Summoning}}''" by {{Wikipedia|Strategic Simulations}} as a placeholder, but it is unknown which ones were used.<ref name=manual>https://theintraclinic.com/archive/loc-2001/manual.html</ref><ref>https://www.myabandonware.com/media/screenshots/t/the-summoning-1it/the-summoning_1.png</ref>
*'''Diana''' - A female mage with red hair, green eyes, and a purple top. She has 46 HP, 26 Power, 8 Attack, and 7 Defense. She is unable to do melee attacks in ''LoC2''.
*'''Green''' - A male ranger with black hair, blue eyes, a light green top similar to [[Player|Alex]], and a green jacket or sweatshirt. He has 86 HP, 55 Power, 13 Attack, and 14 Defense.
*'''Shera''' - A young female warrior with gray eyes, brown hair, a gray sleeveless top, and a sword. She has 107 HP, 46 Power, 17 Attack, and 15 Defense.
*'''Teron''' - An old bald priest with purple eyes, a purple robe, and a light purple top. He has 31 HP, 34 Power, 5 Attack, and 9 Defense. He is unable to do melee attacks in ''LoC2''.
Which heroes take damage from an attack is determined by the direction the attack comes from. The middle heroes take damage from attacks from the front, the outer heroes take damage from attacks from behind, the left heroes take damage from attacks from the left, and the right heroes take damage from attacks from the right. Heroes are able to take damage from other directions if a hero that would normally receive an attack from that direction is dead.

Each hero's HP and power regenerates over time, with power regenerating faster than HP, and more quickly while standing still. A hero's power is reduced by attacking and sprinting, and the party is unable to sprint if any living hero runs out of power. Each hero also has hunger and thirst meters that slowly decrease over time and can be replenished using apples, with indicators appearing on a character's portrait if either is low (which flash in ''LoC2''), though nothing happens when they reach zero.

When a hero dies, items can still be taken in and out of their inventory, but they are unable to perform any actions. When the entire party dies, the camera drops to the ground and the player is unable to move, though they can still turn the camera around.

In ''LoC2'', each hero starts at level 1, but each time the party kills an enemy, each hero earns a random amount of experience points. Each hero needs 200 points to reach level 2, and the number of points needed to reach the next level increases by 200 each time. Upon leveling up, each hero's HP, power, and attack increases by a random amount (except for Diana and Teron, whose attack does not seem to increase).

=== Characters taken from ''{{Wikipedia|Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game)|Eye of the Beholder}}'' ===
[[File:Legend of the chambered.png|thumb|A screenshot of all the characters in the flash version of ''Legend of the Chambered''.]]
These characters are from the flash variant of ''LoC''. The names and sprites are taken from the game ''[[wikipedia:Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game)|Eye of the Beholder]]''.
*'''Taghor''' - A male dwarf with a white beard, a horned helmet, and a brown top.
*'''Keirgar''' - A male wizard with a white beard and a blue robe.
*'''Alyssa''' - A female thief with a green hood and scarf, and black hair.
*'''Largo''' - A male wizard with a purple aesthetic.
*'''Mat''' - A male wizard with a red aesthetic.
*'''Chriss''' - A male dwarf with a blond beard and hair, and a white sleeveless top.

The characters taken from ''{{Wikipedia|Eye_of_the_Beholder_(video_game)|Eye of the Beholder}}'' in the Adobe Flash ''LoC'' had dialog or an onomatopoeia whenever the player attempted to move into a wall, these being: *thud*, *bonk*, "Oof! That hurts!", and "Ouch! These walls are quite hard."

=== Prelude of the Chambered ===
The unseen player character in ''Prelude of the Chambered'' has 20 HP, takes 1 damage from all attacks and deals 1 damage with each attack.

== Enemies ==
The ''LoC'' from 2001 has mummies, the first version of ''LoC'' from 2008 only has monsters in it, while the second version has skeletons, ghosts and spiders. The android version only has slimes. ''PoC'' has bats, eyes, ogres and ghosts, along with boss variants of each.

=== Legend of the Chambered ===
[[File:LoC skeleton.png|thumb|A screenshot from Notch of a skeleton in ''LoC2''. Note that the texture was slightly different in this version.]]
*'''Mummy''' - The texture of the mummy was taken from the game ''{{Wikipedia|Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master}}'' as a placeholder in ''LoC'' 2001.<ref name=manual /> It is unknown what they did, but presumably they attacked the party.
*'''Monster''' - The monster resembles a goblin or [[zombie]] with green skin, messy dark green hair, red eyes, tusks, a rust top, tan pants, and dark blue shoes. Its movement resembles dancing and they wander around aimlessly even when the player is near. If one bumps into the player, it raises its arms and deals 1-7 damage to 1-2 members of the party. They take 10 hits to kill and when killed, they explode into giblets of blood and drop 0-4 coins.
*'''Skeleton''' - Skeletons can be found wandering around in the forest. They pursue and attack the player when in range, raising their arms and dealing 1-7 damage to 1-2 party members upon contact. They have 50 HP and when killed, they explode and drop 0-4 coins. ''Minecraft'' [[skeletons]] are capable of melee attacks, though a bow is always equipped by any naturally spawned skeletons. Their color schemes are also different from each other.
*'''Ghost''' - Ghosts can be found wandering around in the graveyard. They pursue and attack the player when in range, raising their arms and dealing 1-7 damage to 1-2 party members upon contact. They have 50 HP and when killed, they explode and drop 0-4 coins. There are currently no explicit ghosts in ''Minecraft'', however, some mobs are ghost-like such as the [[allay]], the [[vex]], and the [[ghast]]. Their unhappy faces with black eyes and mouths also resemble that of the [[creeper]].
*'''Spider''' - Spiders can be found wandering around in the dungeon. They pursue and attack the player when in range, raising their arms and dealing 1-7 damage to 1-2 party members upon contact. They have 50 HP and when killed, they explode and drop 0-4 coins. Their color scheme is very similar to the original brown [[spider]] texture from ''Minecraft''.
*'''Slime''' - During a Ludum Dare, Notch had planned on making another ''LoC'' game, which he later released as a mobile game on android. The only enemy present is a purple blob-like creature known as a "slime". They had 3 HP and would wander around aimlessly unless a player was near, in which case they would attack. A similar mob is seen in ''[[Legend of the Chambered#List of Legend of the Chambered games|TinyCham]]'' which is green instead of purple. Both have a very different appearance from that of ''Minecraft'' [[slime]]s.

=== Prelude of the Chambered ===
[[File:Prelude Trapping Ghost.png|thumb|The player trapping a ghost in a white box in ''Prelude of the Chambered''.]]
*'''Bat''' - Found in the Prison, Dungeon and Island. It has 2 HP and slowly flies around aimlessly until it bumps into the player, dealing damage, unlike the [[bat]] in ''Minecraft'', which is peaceful.
*'''Eye''' - Fully blue with 4 HP, and quickly flies around aimlessly on the Island and in the Frost Cave until it bumps into the player, dealing damage.
*'''Ogre''' - A green creeper-like humanoid creature that is found on the Island and in the Crypt. It has 6 HP and walks around aimlessly until it bumps into the player, dealing damage, and has a ranged attack of spitting green acid projectiles at the player.
*'''Ghost''' - The ghost is found on the Island and in the Temple. It is the only monster that follows the player, doing so when the player is close, and deals damage on contact. They can move through walls and cannot take damage, and the player has to defeat them by luring them to white boxes.

==== Bosses ====
There is a stronger, golden variant of every creature in ''PoC'', each of which drops a blue key. The golden bat has 5 HP, The golden eye has 10 HP, the golden ogre also has 10 HP and spits four perpendicular streams of golden acid, and the golden ghost spits a stream of golden acid at the player and also has a speed boost, and must be lured through a maze of ghosts in order for it to be trapped.

[[Notch]] made many games with the same name or with similar names. All of them seem to take place at night.
*The first game Notch created under the title of "''Legend of the Chambered''" was released all the way back in 2001.<ref>https://theintraclinic.com/archive/loc-2001/</ref>
**This game had working stairs, pressure-plates, doors, buttons, levers, healing potions, backsacks{{Sic}}, arrows, and quivers. The arrows could be placed inside of quivers.<ref name=manual /> It also had fighting with attack cool-downs, mini-quests, multiple floors and levels, a development mode with the ability to throw a Staff of Creation, and a planned storyline.<ref name=news />
*Notch made two similar 3D dungeon crawlers, ''[https://theintraclinic.com/archive/j4k/dungeon4k/ Dungeon4k]''<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050407102657/http://www.mojang.com/j4k/dungeon4k/</ref> and ''[https://theintraclinic.com/archive/j4k/hunters4k/ Hunters4k]'',<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050218004835/http://www.mojang.com/j4k/hunters4k/</ref> for the Java 4k programming contest in April 2005.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060720090810/http://www.javaunlimited.net/games/java4k_2005.php</ref> (See also: ''[[Minecraft 4k]]'' and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060424151658/http://www.mojang.com/notch/j4k2k6/miners4k/ ''Miners4k''])
**In ''Dungeon4k'', there are specked red stones called power stones that the player uses to charge power fields, which are somewhat similar to the [[redstone]] from ''Minecraft''.
*A game titled ''flashmaze'' was created sometime in 2006. It was a first person shooter prototype in flash using textures from the freedoom project.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060424051003/http://freedoom.sourceforge.net/</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060425081146/http://www.mojang.com/notch/</ref> Although the game didn't seem to have a lot in common with the ''LoC'' games, its webpage was titled "''chambered''".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061217021556/http://www.mojang.com/notch/flashmaze/</ref>
*Notch also made another ''LoC'' game using {{Wikipedia|Adobe Flash}} sometime in 2007, which featured 3D surface rendering and characters from the game ''Eye of the Beholder''.<ref name=intraclinic /><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20071012045055/http://mojang.com/notch/loc/</ref> There is little to no gameplay; the only interactions possible are walking around, bumping into walls, and rotating bottles.
*A basic version of the 2008 ''Legend of the Chambered'' game, with a webpage titled "chambered", was released on May 24 and later added to.<ref name=vimeo />
**Swords and apples were the only items at first, and there was a different font.
**''Legend of the Chambered'' received an update in the same year that changed the font and added more items.
*A second version of this game was created, with a webpage titled "chambered/2", which had a different set of textures and level layout, along with new enemies and items.<ref>{{reddit|jgcpw||TIL that Minecraft's font & some if its sprites came from Notch's old game "Legend of Chambered"|DrRecommended|August 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|jgcpw|c2bxgof|And here's a later version: http://www.mojang.com/notch/chambered/2/|xNotch|August 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|jgcpw|c2c54b7|Is the dirt in this game a higher-resolution version of the dirt in Minecraft? (screenshot)|jecowa|August 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20220509075625/https://imgur.com/Yz8wh</ref>
**While the files are dated to June 20, 2008, it was initially withheld from public release, however Notch announced on May 3, 2009 on the TigSource Forums that the work-in-progress game was now available to play on the Mojang website as an applet, mentioning that he had made the game "a while back".
**There is an unused ball texture. There were balls in ''PoC'' used for puzzles, though the texture was closer to that of a boulder.
**In the game files there is a file named {{code|ToHackers.class}}. Inside is a message by Notch: {{code|Hi! I'm cool with you poking around in here (the obfuscation is for size),}}{{code|but please don't distribute any modified versions of this game.}}{{code|If you've got any suggestions, let me know at markus@mojang.com.}}{{code|Thanks, Notch.}}
*In October 2008, Notch also made another game called ''TinyCham'' (''Tiny Chambered''),<ref>https://jvm-gaming.org/t/tinycham/32449</ref> a similar dungeon crawler with a 40×30 pixel resolution, which was followed by a sequel later that month, ''Eye of the Onlooker II - The Legend of Tinymoon''.
**The sequel is a tiny remake of ''{{Wikipedia|Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon}}''.<ref>https://jvm-gaming.org/t/tinycham/32449/5</ref>
*''Legend of the Chambered - Book 1'' was a game for TinyGame 2010 which featured dithering.<ref>https://jvm-gaming.org/t/legend-of-the-chambered-book-1/35155</ref>
*In some posts Notch made during the Ludum Dare 19 competition in December 2010, he had some screenshots of a game that was labeled ''LoC'' (''Legend of the Chambered''). This one however mainly used billboarded sprites instead of raycasted surfaces. Soothing music would play in the background;<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20191221080440/http://ludumdare.com/compo/2010/12/18/here-try-this/</ref> one could go up stairs, pick up items, and throw them;<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20191221064121/http://ludumdare.com/compo/2010/12/18/sleep_then_game/</ref> and purple slimes would wander around and attack the player.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20191221082336/http://ludumdare.com/compo/2010/12/19/giving-up-need-more-sleep/</ref>
**Although he didn't finish this version of the game,<ref>{{tweet|Notch|16281878906540033|Current state of my LD19 entry: http://mojang.com/notch/ld19/ ! I go sleep now. More tomorrow.|December 18, 2010}}</ref> at the end of the month, he began working on it again,<ref>{{tweet|Notch|20949450373468160|Two hours left on 2010, and I'm coding! I decided to try to make something out of my failed LD19 entry. https://web.archive.org/web/20220821121359/https://i.imgur.com/FuMOP.png|December 31, 2010}}</ref> released a playtest,<ref name=jan1 /> and eventually released a version for android devices.<ref name=jan9 />
***In this version of ''Legend of the Chambered'', a sound titled "oof" can be found in the code, which may be the same sound that the [[Player]] used to make.{{Verify}}
**In January 2013, Notch shared a few screenshots of another Chambered-like game reusing some textures from the Ludum Dare version.<ref>{{tweet|notch|287226380255637505|http://i.imgur.com/9QmNz.png|January 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{reddit2|sub=gamedev|id=16mv8k|cid=c7xjbos|text=Playing around with it on the side, yes. http://i.imgur.com/GJcwF.png|author=xNotch|date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>
*''Prelude of the Chambered'' was an entry for the Ludum Dare 21 competition in August 2011, the theme of which was "Escape".
*Notch made a JavaScript version of ''[[Minecraft 4k]]'' in 2012 titled "ChamberedTest".<ref>{{tweet|notch|275331530040160256|Trying http://jsfiddle.net: http://jsfiddle.net/uzMPU/|December 2, 2012}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
[[File:Legend of the Chambered Items.png|thumb|A comparison between the sprites from ''Legend of the Chambered'' 2008-1 and ''Minecraft'' pre-1.4.]]
[[File:Mockup of a survival inventory.png|thumb|Notch’s survival inventory mockup, featuring graphics from ''Legend of the Chambered.'']]
[[File:Prelude trinket.jpg|thumb|One of the 12 golden trinkets that can be found hidden throughout the levels.]]
*Notch has referred to ''Legend of the Chambered'' as "''LoC''" on several occasions,<ref name=jan1>{{tweet|Notch|21393130330791936|I stole a puzzle idea from @increpare, here's a playtest of LoC_LD19: http://mojang.com/notch/ld19/2/|January 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name=jan9>{{tweet|Notch|24211705500270592|If you absolutely know what you're doing, check out mojang.com/m/LoC_android.apk and let me know how it performs and where.|January 9, 2011}}</ref> and many of his ''Chambered'' games have files that are named "''LoC''" or "''PoC''".
*The textures for some items in ''Minecraft'' were the same at first to their textures in ''Legend of the Chambered'', but with time some modifications were made, and some items were completely removed.
**Much of ''Minecraft's'' [[GUI]] has parallels to the GUI and buttons of ''Legend of the Chambered''.
**Notch used UI elements from ''LoC'' in a survival inventory mockup during the development of [[Survival Test]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20200217032613/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/220323641/mockup-of-a-potential-inventory-screen-do-we</ref>
**Other notable unfinished games Notch made that he took sprites from for ''Minecraft'' were ''[[RubyDung]]'' (grass and cobblestone) and ''[[Zombie Town]]''<ref>{{citation|url=https://archive.org/details/ZombieTown_Video|title=Zombie Town|website=Archive.org|author=Notch|date=October 30, 2009}}</ref> (the [[Mob (entity)|Mob]]/[[Player|Steve]] texture and possibly the [[zombie]] texture).
*Notch had planned on adding stats to ''Minecraft'' similar to the ones he had in these games.<ref>[[Java Edition removed features#Player stats]]</ref>
*There are floating blue eyes in both ''Prelude of the Chambered'' and in a similar game by Notch, ''[https://theintraclinic.com/archive/j4k/hunters4k/ Hunters4k]''. The ones in ''PoC'' are simply called "eyes", and the ones in ''Hunters4k'' are called "hunters". The [[Eye of Ender|eyes of ender]] from ''Minecraft'' can also float and are also blue, with the exception of the green iris.
*There are green creatures in both ''Prelude of the Chambered'' and ''Legend of the Chambered''. The ones in ''PoC'' are called "ogres", and the ones in ''LoC'' are called "monsters". There are also green creatures in another one of Notch's games, ''MetaGun'',<ref>{{ytl|u8DXtBNzPwg|Making Metagun|Nizzotch|Aug 22, 2010}}</ref> called "gremlins".
**In the early development of ''Minecraft'', Notch stated that he would like to add monsters roaming the land. He gave examples of [[Java Edition mentioned features#Lava Zombie and Troll|lava zombies or troll infestations]]. Later, the [[zombie]] was implemented, and a humanoid mob called a [[Monster (entity)|monster]] was added and then removed.<ref>{{citation|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg215704#msg215704|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=Tigsource|date=June 17, 2009}}</ref>
*The Power Glove in ''Prelude of the Chambered'' also appears in another one of Notch's games, ''[[Minicraft]]'', which was made for another Ludum Dare four months later.
*The game ''Doomgeon'' took inspiration from ''Prelude of the Chambered''.<ref>{{tweet|OkaeriStudio|1097964057368453123|As many of you notice, #Doomgeon took inspiration from #Doom and #Diablo, but also, believe it or not, the main idea is from "prelude of the chambered" a small game for Ludum Dare from @notch|February 19, 2019}}</ref>
*On Notch's old [[YouTube]] channel, [[Nizzotch]], there was a video of him making ''Prelude of the Chambered''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcfFJ6pNEZk</ref> The video has been deleted, but there are archives of it.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoR-G8Ud0JM&list=PLYvbqe7pJsoP9Z2AisjV8jcRPZzV93j7i&index=39&t=0s</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://archive.org/details/nizzotch_archive|title=Nizzotch Archive|website=Archive.org|author=Notch|date=December 30, 2021}}</ref>
**He also livestreamed himself coding the game on Twitch.<ref>{{twl|38122738}}</ref><ref>{{twl|38122676}}</ref><ref>{{twl|38122721}}</ref><ref>{{twl|38123128}}</ref>
