'''''Terraria''''' is a 2011 action-adventure sandbox game developed by {{wikipedia|Re-Logic}}, commonly referred to as a two-dimensional counterpart to ''[[Minecraft]]''. As a result, many references and collaborations have been made between the two over the years.

=== The Wither ===
{{main|Wither}}
In an interview on [[Minecraft.net]], [[Jens Bergensten]] explained that the wither mob was inspired by bosses in ''Terraria''.<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-wither|Meet the Wither|February 13, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref> Specifically, he was interested in how the boss fights were always initiated by player actions, which gave him the idea to make [[Player|players]] build withers.

=== Splash text ===
{{main|Splash}}
Among the many splash texts on the [[Title Screen|title screen]] is the phrase "Also try Terraria!" Similarly, ''Terraria'' has its own [https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Title_messages title messages], one of which being "''Terraria: Also try Minecraft!''" For unknown reasons, the splash was removed, along with many other splashes, in ''Bedrock Edition'' [[Bedrock Edition 1.9.0|version 1.9.0]] on February 5, 2019.

=== Creeper set ===
