'''13w12~''' refers to two debug [[snapshot]]s for [[Java Edition 1.5.1]], released on March 19, 2013 that attempted to fix an issue with the frame rate dropping significantly when using smooth lighting. The first debug snapshot was unsuccessful,<ref>{{tweet|jeb|314026805415772160|I've uploaded a temporary snapshot for testing performance. If you have time, please give it a try:|March 19, 2013}}</ref> while the second debug snapshot was successful in fixing this bug.<ref>https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-8824?focusedCommentId=55456#comment-55456</ref> The first snapshot was released on Mojira as a "temporary snapshot",<ref>https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-8824?focusedCommentId=55414#comment-55414</ref> which is why these snapshots do not follow regular naming conventions.

These snapshots were only released as clients; no corresponding server was released. However, these snapshots share their [[protocol version]] number with snapshots [[13w09c]] through [[13w11a]], meaning that 13w12~ can connect to servers running any of those snapshots.

== Trivia ==
* The first upload of this version holds the record for the least amount of changes in a snapshot, almost changing nothing.
* This is the first snapshot that breaks the naming convention set by every snapshot, since it doesn't include a letter at the end of it.
