A '''bookshelf''' is a [[block]] that improves [[enchanting|enchantments]] applied with an [[enchanting table]] when placed around one, up to a maximum of fifteen bookshelves, at the expense of [[Experience|level]] requirement.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Bookshelves can be mined by hand, but are broken faster with an [[axe]]. In either case, they drop 3 books when broken, allowing the reconstruction of the bookshelf with the addition of six wood planks. When broken by a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], a bookshelf drops itself.

=== Natural generation ===
Bookshelves can generate in [[village]] libraries and sometimes village houses.

[[Stronghold]]s may contain up to two libraries, each of which may be single-level or have an upper balcony. These feature some bookshelves arranged in pillars, and more bookshelves arranged in pillars in the walls. Single-level libraries contain 161 bookshelves, while libraries with balconies contain 233.

Bookshelves also naturally generate in certain [[woodland mansion]] rooms. Various rooms can have between 1-24 bookshelves, while the "large library" room contains 180.

== Usage ==
=== Enchanting ===
{{main|Enchanting#Bookshelves}}

If an [[enchanting table]] is placed near a bookshelf, glyph [[particles]] fly from the bookshelf toward the enchanting table. Having bookshelves in the proper position near the table allows the table to apply higher-level enchantments.

Fifteen bookshelves need to be near an enchanting table to gain the maximum of level 30 enchantments.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Fuel ===
Bookshelves can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Villager ===
Librarian [[villager]]s can interact with bookshelves.

=== Note Blocks ===
Bookshelves can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
