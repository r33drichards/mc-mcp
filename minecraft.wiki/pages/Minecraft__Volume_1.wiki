== Quotes ==
{{Quote|The most exciting part as a queer person, and a nonbinary person working in the environment of Minecraft, the people who were supporting the comic, who wanted it to exist want to include diversity, we want to show that its not just binary kids playing, white kids playing, we get to show the full spectrum of identity playing in this game, literally limitless, you can be and do anything which is so exciting to see taking shape in comics, especially in Minecraft.

It was wild to me, because coming up in the industry was a very binary game, the editors that we're working with, when they pitched it were like we want to make sure diversity is at the forefront of Minecraft and that's one of the keystones of the platform

Infinite diversity means you can model and reshape the world, and the friendships that you're building are constantly modelling and reshaping and your identities can transition within the game, the game can accommodate that, make a space to explore yourself and figure out who you are and what you are and how you fit into the world.|[[Sfé Monster]]<ref>{{Citation|url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/sarah-graley-sfe-monster-non-binary-appeal-minecraft-comic/|title=Sarah Graley and Sfé Monster on the Non-Binary Appeal of a Minecraft Comic at ECCC|author=[https://bleedingcool.com/author/rich-johnston/ Rich Johnston]|website=Bleeding Cool|date=March 16, 2019}}</ref>}}

== Trivia ==

* The cover for the comic was used on the 4 day passes for {{Wikipedia|Emerald City Comic Con}} 2019.<ref>{{Tweet|sarahgraleyart|1106758956318420993|Also: extremely stoked about the Minecraft cover (for the book me and @sfemonster made, out in July!) being on the 4 day passes! 😱💖💖💖}}</ref>
* The book's unique art style, noticeably more round than typical iterations, was partly requested by the editors. Illustrator [[Sarah Graley]] struggled with the task, calling out the [[ender dragon]]'s design, but was satisfied with the finished result.<ref>{{Mcnet|new-graphic-novel|New Graphic Novel|May 25, 2019|[[Tom Stone]]}}</ref>

=== Errors ===

* [[Tyler]] at one point throws an [[ender pearl]] to reach a destination, drawn identical to an [[eye of ender]].
* [[Candace]] at one point is said to have set off a [[creeper]], destroying a [[nether portal]] that Grace ended up replacing. This is impossible, since [[obsidian]] was designed specifically to be resistant to [[explosions]].
* During the first scene in the [[Hibiscus House]], three [[chests]] can be seen next to each other. Although the frames are noticeable, they lack borders, making it appear as one long chest divided into three sections, one resembling a double chest.
