A '''colosseum''' is a large [[structure]] found in the [[Potato dimension]], added in [[24w14potato]]. It houses the [[mega spud]] boss.

== Generation ==
Colosseums generate sparsely throughout all [[Biome|biomes]] in the [[Potato (dimension)|Potato dimension]]. It is the only place to find the main boss of this update, mega spud. Upon generation, colosseum always spawns one mega spud, as well as a large number of [[plaguewhale slab]]s and [[toxifin slab]]s.

Colosseums can be located by throwing [[potato eye]]s.

== Structure ==
Colosseums are based on [[bastion remnant]]s of the treasure room type, but unlike bastions, they don't have any variation: every colosseum is exactly the same. In place of [[polished blackstone bricks]] and its variants, the structure is made up of [[baked potato bricks]], [[potone]], [[taterstone]], and their variants. Two blocks of [[chiseled polished blackstone]] are present as well, and the structure's file structure is nearly identical to that of a treasure-type bastion, further pointing to the fact that the colosseum was copied from a bastion remnant. The entrance to the colosseum is usually covered up by the terrain, so players must dig their way into the structure.

A pool of water lies at the bottom of the colosseum, replacing lava from bastions. Most of these water blocks are actually [[Waterlogging|waterlog]]ged [[light block]]s, which means, for example, that lava cannot turn them into stone. Beneath the water, a 1-block-high maze generates, which leads to a cage under the central platform, where four [[monster spawner]]s of [[toxifin slab]]s can be found. The maze is made out of [[charred baked potato bricks]] and their variants, which have extremely high hardness, so players are forced to crawl their way through the maze if they want to destroy the spawners.

There are no loot chests, as the main reason for players to come to this structure is to fight with mega spud. There are some [[pedestal]]s that can bring players back to the Overworld.
