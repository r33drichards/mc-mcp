Dock is the creator of the [[mobs]] [[Rana]] (a character of his, merely used for testing purposes), [[Steve (mob)|Steve]], [[Black Steve]] and [[Beast Boy]], notable by their striking difference in style compared to other mobs. He also created a ''Minecraft'' [[logo]] that went unused, as well as concept art.
