This version also adds features from [[Bedrock Edition 1.5.0]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.6.0|1.6.0]].

'''Agent Improvements ''(based on community feedback)'''''
* {{cmd|remove}}
** Remove [[agent]]s from the world
* Players will be able to show the agent coordinates on the HUD
* {{cmd|summon agent}} now creates or teleports the executor’s agent to the executor.
* New command selectors
** <code>@c</code> to target the executor’s agent, <code>@v</code> to target all agents
** Only players with the permission <code>worldbuilders</code> can target all agents. By default all users will have <code>wordbuilder</code> permissions set to false.
* The usual type filters can also be used to target particular agents, so {{cmd|tp @e<nowiki>[type=Agent,name=Steve.Agent]</nowiki> @s}} for instance would look through all entities for those of type agent whose name is Steve.Agent and teleport them to the executor. For more of a shorthand you could do {{cmd|/tp @v<nowiki>[name=Steve.Agent]</nowiki> @s}} to target a particular person's agent that's not your own
* Added spawn eggs for agents

'''[[Library (Minecraft Education)|Library]] Beta'''
* Allows players to view and download worlds in-game without having to go to website. Players will see a new button on their home screen called "Library" which leads to a list of dynamically generated "must have" worlds

'''Heads-up-display'''
* Added mouse and keyboard control tips to the in-game HUD, to help players learn the how to move, break/place blocks, etc.
* On by default for teachers and off by default for students, and can be configured in the settings menu.

'''"How to Play" menu'''
* Added Education content to the "How to Play" menu.

'''Educator Resources'''
* A button on the home screen (which will show for teachers only) that takes users to a new resource on website designed to connect them with the latest and greatest training, lessons and community content

== Changes ==
'''Coding'''
* [[Code Builder]] can now be used in the game rather than via a separate app. Players will be able to launch code builder using {{key|C}} if you are using a mouse/keyboard or by pressing the agent icon next to pause/chat on the top center of the screen while on touch.
* [https://code.org Code.org] and [https://scratch.mit.edu Scratch] will not be present at launch in-game. The Code Connection app can still be used to use these applications.
* Removed {{cmd|code}}.

== Reviews ==
{{Q|I use Minecraft to teach the basic about coding with MakeCode. The students are 10-12 years old and during the time they learn how to code they also discover how a computer works. I think it is important for our students to develop computational skills, because they are going to need it in the future.|Leticia Ahumada, Spain<ref name="update">{{cite|url=https://education.minecraft.net/blog/download-the-code-builder-update-to-learn-coding-in-minecraft/|title=Download the Code Builder Update to Learn Coding in Minecraft|date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>}}

{{Q|I have students who only use text-based coding and others who struggle with the computational thinking aspect and use the tutorials. I love it because students are engaged, they’re learning and (most importantly) they share their experience with others. ‘Please come try my program’ is a frequent comment uttered in our coding period.|James Wood, U.S.<ref name="update"/>}}

{{Q|Code Builder can be taught by teachers that might not have advanced coding skills themselves. Being able to work in a 3D environment is exciting. I love seeing the looks on the faces of my students and there never seems to be any problem with engagement. It helps develop resilience and determination when faced with failure. Great Growth Mindset teaching.|Michael Clemens, New Zealand<ref name="update"/>}}

{{Q|Right now, 2 middle schools in my district are using the Code Builder and/or the CS curriculum from MEE to teach 6th, 7th, and 8th graders programming. I foresee this being a great way for students to have a wonderful background knowledge in Javascript as they enter high school.|Trish Cloud, U.S.<ref name="update"/>}}
