The ''Minecraft'' '''logo''' is used in its many forms to represent [[Minecraft (franchise)|its franchise]] and [[Minecraft|the game]].

== Description ==
{{Expand section|section=Description}}
The base ''Minecraft'' game logo is 3D text containing "MINECRAFT", rotated slightly upward. It appears to be made of cracked stone in older designs, or stone with etch marks in newer designs, and the letter A has the face of a [[creeper]] as a hole. Several variations exist, also containing 3D text though not always with the stone material.

=== Historical changes ===
Minecraft's first logo was originally showcased only at [[Notch]]'s personal blog ''[[The Word of Notch]]''. It was designed as the word "MINECRAFT" formed by [[cobblestone]] blocks.

An updated version of the previous logo was first seen on [[Minecraft.net|the official website]] on May 22, 2009 and it would later be used in-game when the phase of [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] ([[Java Edition Indev 0.31|v0.31]]) started on December 23. Changes include that the logo was made brighter and a shadow was added to it. It could be seen only at the menu screen against a wall made of dirt. It was later used in [[Java Edition Infdev|Infdev]] and early Alpha versions.

In [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.4|Alpha v1.0.4]], the texture of the blocks were changed from [[cobblestone]] to [[stone]]. An animation was also added where the stone blocks would fall to the wall forming the word "Minecraft" (this feature along with the logo was removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.4|Beta 1.4]]).

[[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] unveiled Minecraft's most well known logo in [[Java Edition Beta 1.4|Beta 1.4]], the previous design was replaced with a hand drawn stone-like lettering, in which the iconic face of the creeper was added to the "A".

The logo was slightly retouched in [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], some of the reflections of the letters were a bit decreased. This is the design that would later be used for the [[Java Edition#Official release|full release of the game]] ([[Java Edition 1.0.0|v1.0.0]]) on November 18, 2011 and also seen in merchandise and other media.

In 2017, [[Java Edition|the PC version]] of Minecraft was renamed as the ''Java Edition'' to separate it from [[Bedrock Edition]], which was renamed from ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' to just ''Minecraft'' by the [[Better Together Update]]. This logo was introduced in version [[Java Edition 1.12.2|1.12.2]] and while most versions of Minecraft uses the main design that was established since 2015, Java Edition kept using the original with the addition of the "Java Edition" subtitle. The logo was modified in version [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]], the gray tone of the letters was made lighter and thick outline was added around them.

On August 31, 2021, one of [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]]'s workers, Ined, [https://twitter.com/Mojang_Ined/status/1432731734110613508 officially announced] on his Twitter account that a flat logo would begin to be used for the franchise while the detailed one would still be used for the game itself. This change took effect on Minecraft's [[Minecraft.net|official website]]. The logo itself looks similar to the polished logo used for [[Minecraft Live]] and [[Minecraft Festival]], but with minor changes like a thicker outline, the removed reflections in the letters and the slightly altered creeper face in the "A".

For the 15th anniversary of Minecraft, Mojang revealed the new slogan for Minecraft - ''"Shape your world".'' This change is first seen in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aDWhUJdYDk new Minecraft's trailer] on Minecraft's [https://youtube.com/@minecraft official YouTube channel] and on an [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/shape-your-world article] on Minecraft's [https://minecraft.net official website].
