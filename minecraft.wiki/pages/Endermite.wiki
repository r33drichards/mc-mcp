'''Endermites''' are small [[arthropod]] [[hostile mob]]s that sometimes spawn when a [[player]] throws an [[ender pearl]], and attack by biting. [[Endermen]] are hostile toward endermites.

== Spawning ==
Endermites have a 5% chance to spawn when a player-thrown ender pearl lands. They spawn at the player's original position when the pearl lands{{only|je}}, or at the pearl's landing site{{only|be}}.

An endermite despawns within 2 minutes, regardless of the player's distance, unless it has been named with a [[name tag]]. This applies even when it is in a [[minecart]], [[boat]], or [[boat with chest]].

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Endermites drop {{xp|3}} experience orbs when killed by a player or [[tamed wolf]].

== Behavior ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Enderman farming}}
Endermites attack players within 16 [[block]]s.

{{IN|JE}}, endermites become hostile towards any mob that attacks another endermite. Endermites {{in|BE}} on the other hand do not become hostile towards any mob that attacks it.

[[Enderman|Endermen]] attack endermites in line of sight within 64 blocks. Endermites attack endermen {{in|BE}}.

As [[arthropod]]s, endermites are affected by the [[Bane of Arthropods]] enchantment.

Like endermen, the eye of an endermite is emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Endermites are the smallest hostile mob by hitbox size.
* Endermites are said to come from an "in-between" dimension, and are left behind by endermen as they teleport through.<ref>{{YouTube link|Tjloo2AHgng|archive=|MINECON Earth - Java Team Panel|Minecraft|November 18, 2017|t=225s}}</ref>
** In a 2025 [[minecraft.net]] article, the dimension that endermites come from was referred to as a terrifying and "scary in-betweeny dimension". It is explained that endermites attack players and endermen because they don’t like "being dragged between dimensions".<ref name="mcnet">{{mcnet|endermite|Mob Menagerie: Endermite|September 22, 2025|Duncan Geere|archive-url|archive-time|url-prefix}}</ref>
* According to the same article, endermites are "Lil fuzzy wuzzy killers".<ref name="mcnet"/>
* [[Dinnerbone]] once mentioned an "ultimate plan" for endermites involving the [[dragon egg]], though this never came to fruition.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|444176255521681408|I do have an Ultimate Plan™ with endermites, but it will wait. May also include dragon egg but I haven't discussed this with the team yet.|March 13, 2014|archive=|archiveid=}}</ref>
** In response to a question asking if the ultimate plan was an evil plan,<ref>{{tweet|TheEvilOlives|444177567075954688|@Dinnerbone ooh is it an evil plan?|March 13, 2014|archive=|archiveid=}}</ref> Dinnerbone stated that "everything is an evil plan to somebody".<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|444177665076248576|@TheEvilOlives Everything is an evil plan to somebody|March 13, 2014|archive=|archiveid=}}</ref>
