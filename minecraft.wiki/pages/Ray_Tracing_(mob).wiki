'''Ray Tracing''' is a humanoid [[mob]] exclusive to the April Fools' snapshot [[Java Edition 23w13a or b|23w13a_or_b]] that spawns within the [[Overworld]].

== Spawning ==
Ray Tracing can be allowed into a world by activating the vote <code>minecraft:ray_tracing</code> and waiting for the message "Ray Tracing has joined the game". Ray Tracing spawns at a random position around the world spawnpoint, regardless of the gamerule <code>spawnRadius</code>.

== Behavior ==
Throwing a splash bottle of Ray Tracing at any mob disguises it as Ray Tracing. Hostile mobs target a changed Ray Tracing. If a hostile mob was disguised as Ray Tracing, it attacks the attacker.

Ray Tracing wanders randomly in the world, sending random chat messages to the player. Upon death, Ray Tracing sends a random chat message.

When the vote <code>minecraft:ray_tracing</code> is repealed, "Ray Tracing has left the game" is sent on the chat and the entity despawns.

=== Chat messages ===
When the entity has initially spawned, Ray Tracing sends a spawn message after between 4 and 30 seconds. Idle messages are sent in intervals of between 30 and 180 seconds.
