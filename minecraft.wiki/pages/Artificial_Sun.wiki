The '''Artificial Sun''' (人工太陽, ''Jinkō Taiyō'') is a large artificial light source created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
The Artificial Sun resembles a massive, featureless [[Block of Coal]].

== Functionality ==
When ignited, the Artificial Sun causes a blinding flash of light, though only for a second. If ignited while in the air, this flash of light is powerful enough to act as a fake sun, causing undead mobs to burn even at night.
