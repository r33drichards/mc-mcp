== History ==
In the announcement video of [[The Copper Age]] (then known as Drop 3 2025), when introducing the [[copper chest]], some screenshots of it were shown in various stages of oxidation. These screenshots were taken in a [[lush cave]], where instead of the usual [[glow berries]], there are blue berries.

Following the release of the video, Bedrock tech lead [[Xilefian]] posted on his Fediverse profile:

I suppose it's a peek behind the curtain of how artists on the team practice the Minecraft style 🤷‍♂️|image=Xilefian.jpg|[[Xilefian]]<ref name=xilefian />}}

In the description of the video, Mojang added the following clarification:
{{quote|Note: we accidentally featured a mis-colored glowberry in this Dev Diary. Whoops! Though we have been known to sneak secrets into our videos, this is an actual mistake and doesn't hint at anything. We are working on game drops packed with new features, but re-colored glowberries aren't one of them. Apologies to fans of cave fruit!|image=Minecraft social icon.png|Video description<ref name=video />}}
