==== Summary ====
Following the release of {{AMCM}}, Sofia Dankis decides to go on a vacation, going back to the [[The Nether|Nether]] after a previous visit. She prepares a [[Nether portal|portal]] beside a lake, going in as the sun sets. Aware of the dangers, she decides to act unaware, only to run away from a troop of [[Piglin|piglins]] with her eyes closed. Running into a [[Soul Sand Valley|soul sand valley]], she trips on a random block, and realizes it's a [[Dried Ghast|dried ghast]]. As the piglins close in, she decides to grip it "like a security blanket," and runs back to the portal.

Back at her [[chicken]] coop, she recognizes the thing as a [[ghastling]], and began to study it. As it began to rehydrate and grow, she noticed its change in demeanor, until it matured into a full [[Happy Ghast|happy ghast]]. Recognizing its angelic qualities, she decided to take it out on a road trip, promising to write letters to chickens. With that, the two ventured out into the [[Overworld]].<ref name="nether" />

==== Summary ====
As Sofia embarks on her quest, she feels the digestion of [[Suspicious Stew|suspicious stew]], filling her with determination. Riding across the happy ghast, her [[Locator Bar|locator bar]] identifies someone in the distance, traveling to the [[Snowy Taiga|snowy taiga]] biome to investigate. She discovers a grove of [[poppies]], and keeps a mental note to look for [[Crafting Table|crafting tables]], hoping to dye her [[harness]] red. She begins to write a postcard "before [her] feet even touched the ground."

Discovering an igloo, Sofia runs into none other than [[Sunny]] inside, who was about to gather [[Dye|dyes]] for a project. Chasing them into the woods, Sunny discovers another patch of poppies, Sofia stealing some behind their back. Suddenly, Sofia decides to prioritize earning a {{Wikipedia|Nobel Prize}} for "Arts & Minecrafts speech," Sunny going out to a frozen lake. Curious, Sofia ends up racing them to it, sliding into Sunny on the [[ice]].

From there they decide to go on a trek together, enjoying the [[sun]]. Sofia is inspired to tell Sunny a Japanese word, only to overhear a strange noise. Thinking it was an echo from the ghast, Sofia began clearing her throat to sing a minor key, only to realize it's actually a hungry [[wolf]]. Sofia watches as it hunts a fox, before returning to the ghast. Borrowing Sunny's crafting table, she finally dyes her harness, and finishes the postcard as she leaves.<ref name="cold">{{mcnet|overworld-adventures-chapter-2|Causing a Cold Commotion|May 9, 2025|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

==== Summary ====
Likening herself to {{Wikipedia|Superman}} and calling herself a "Sky Skribe," Sofia continues voyaging across a happy ghast. Finding the prior adventure "harrowing yet thrilling," she thinks back to her fancy new, dyed harness. She likes the idea of matching outfit, before getting distracted by [[Horse|ponies]]. Before leaving to admire them, she remembers to start another postcard.

Setting out to tame a horse, she quickly locates a field of [[Cornflower|cornflowers]], and then hoof sounds. As she approaches the horses, she discovers a troop of [[Pillager|pillagers]], stationed at an [[outpost]]. Finding it too late to run away, she decides to take the horses head-on, escaping the pillage. Finding the prairie flat and calming, she ends up falling off into a [[Canyon|ravine]]. As she picks herself back up, she exclaims the importance of lawnmowers.

Venturing back to the surface, she decided to check her locator bar, and was completely alone. She becomes horribly distraught by the loneliness, but manages to find a fork in the ravine. One led to a pool of [[lava]], the other a [[cave]], which she decides to spelunk into. Fending off many spiders, she eventually escapes to the surface, and claims a bunch of cornflowers. Deciding to give the ghast a new blue harness, she finishes her postcard before leaving.<ref name="best">{{mcnet|overworld-adventures-chapter-3|Simply the Best|May 12, 2025|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

==== Summary ====
Having been in the skies for several days now, Sofia struggles to find a fourth pitstop. Using the locator bar, she pinpoints the location of [[Noor]] and arranges a rendezvous. Apparently, they hadn't seen each other since an expedition to find [[pottery sherds]], Sofia never getting her [[brush]] back from them. Landing in a [[bamboo jungle]], Sofia realizes Noor isn't there, and begins investigating.

Marching between [[bamboo]], Sofia discovers [[pandas]] playing, and gets offended by a sneeze. Her eye almost gets impaled by a [[slimeball]]. From there she discovers a cluster of [[Azalea tree|azalea trees]], and decides to take a quick break from searching. However, she realizes there's a camp belonging to Noor nearby, but verifies Noor still isn't quite there. She decides to venture down into a [[lush cave]].

Entering into the underground, Sofia is quite impressed by the [[mineshaft]] and beautiful plants. Plucking several [[glow berries]], she discovers many mobs, including [[glow squids]] and axolotls hunting [[tropical fish]]. Sofia decides to rest to preserve energy, but believes she goes through a surreal dream, where a [[Noor|skeleton]] drags her out of the cave by the foot and steals a second brush. She finds herself again lying on podzol, surrounded by parrots. Hearing a parrot make a [[skeleton]] sound, she comes to the conclusion that the parrots had a psychic connection with her. Looking back at the path, she realizes it's grown back while she was in the cave, stranding her, only for her to just go back to the ghast anyway. Deciding to wait to meet up with Noor, she gets the idea for her next destination, and leaves.<ref name="dreamscape">{{mcnet|dreamscape-escape|Dreamscape Escape|May 15, 2025|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

==== Summary ====
Now several weeks into the trip, Sofia notices the sight of a large [[fossil]] in a [[mangrove swamp]], already perfectly excavated. Immediately, Sofia decides to jot down on a new postcard and perform a dance. However, in the process she ends up spinning into a [[Bee Nest|bee nest]], angering a swarm of [[bees]]. Before she could be saved, she gets pulled into the murky waters, only for her to then get distracted by a [[frog]].

After waiting it out, the two swam to shore, the savior revealed to be [[Kai]]. It's explained Kai went on an expedition to this area and uncovered the fossil, having previously discovered [[Froglight|froglights]]. Conversing over a meal, Kai is said to be exhausted from wandering the Overworld on foot, and sheds a tears upon being told of happy ghasts. 

Very soon Sofia decides to part with Kai, but realizes the [[Tadpole|tadpoles]] wanted to join her on her quest. After scooping up the tadpoles with a [[Water Bucket|bucket]], Kai decides to tag along as well, hoping to do more archeology.<ref name="magicmud">{{mcnet|overworld-adventures-chapter-5|The Magic of Mud|May 21, 2025|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

=== Postcards ===
{{Quote|Welcome to a biome that was first seen in a spooky update, but didn’t reach its final form until years later when it made a big splash! It’s a wonder that poppies and dandelions are able to grow in all this snow. The climate here is so cold that even rain doesn’t stand a chance, it turns to snow long before it hits the ground. The wildlife here is both hostile and passive. There aren’t any lions, tigers, or bears, even if the name would lead you to believe that at least one of them lives here with the wolves, foxes, and rabbits.|Causing a Cold Commotion|image=Photo EE2.png}}{{Quote|Four-legged friends frolick among flowers both red and blue! Sometimes, areas like this are a sea of yellow too (and I’m not just talking about bees.) For such an unassuming place, pillager outposts and hidden ravines makes this a more hazardous place than meets the eye! Are you still guessing, even though I’ve let my location slip not once, not twice, but thrice already? Best wishes from the plains!|Simply the Best|image=Photo EE2.png}}
{{Quote|This gorgeous green biome has major zen vibes, even though it first saw the light of day in the raucous [[Village & Pillage]] Update. The humid climate doesn’t just give my hair that extra frizz that’s so in vogue right now, it also creates the perfect conditions for lush caves! Pandas, parrots, podzols – it’s almost criminal this biome’s name breaks the alliteration, even if it is with a letter that rhymes with P. Season’s greetings from the Bamboo Jungle!|Dreamscape Escape|image=Photo EE2.png}}{{Quote|Fossils are a mix of [[Bone Block|bone]] and [[coal ore|coal]] or [[diamond ore|diamond]], and only naturally generate in three different biomes. There are three types of frogs in the Overworld, but this is the home of the warm frog. The trees that have lent their name to this biome have aerial roots and can grow both on land and in water.|The Magic of Mud|image=Photo EE2.png}}
