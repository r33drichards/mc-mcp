'''20w49a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on December 2, 2020,<ref>{{snap|20w49a|December 2, 2020}}</ref> which adds [[sculk sensor]]s, the [[dripstone caves]] biome, and the ability to expand the world height limit.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Sculk Sensor JE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk sensor]]'''
* A new redstone component.
* Detects vibrations, and emits a redstone signal.
* Emits a different strength if connected to a [[comparator]], and the signal strength is based on the vibration's frequency.
* Vibrations can be occluded using [[wool]] blocks.
* Can only be obtained via the [[Creative inventory]] or commands such as {{cmd|give}}.

=== World generation ===
'''{{BiomeLink|Dripstone caves}}'''
* A new underground [[biome]].
* Made up of primarily [[dripstone block]]s and [[stone]], with large clusters of dripstone blocks hanging from the ceiling, [[pointed dripstone]] on the floor and ceiling and many pools of water.
* Does not generate naturally in normal worlds, and can only be generated using [[buffet]] worlds with "Dripstone caves" selected as the source biome or using [[custom]] world.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Added death messages for being skewered by a falling stalactite:
** "<player> was skewered by a falling stalactite"
** "<player> was skewered by a falling stalactite whilst fighting <entity>"

'''[[Particle]]s'''
* New particle types: <code>vibration</code> and <code>dust_color_transition</code>

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>dripstone_replaceable_blocks</code> block tag.
** Contains the <code>base_stone_overworld</code> block tag and dirt.
** Used in dripstone generation to determine what dripstone can replace and what pointed dripstone can generate on.
* Added the <code>occludes_vibration_signals</code> block tag.
** Contains the <code>wool</code> block tag.
** Blocks in this tag prevent sculk sensors from hearing vibrations if the block is between the sculk sensor and the vibration.
* Added new <code>game_events</code> tag type.
* Added the <code>ignore_vibrations_stepping_carefully</code> game event tag.
** Contains the step, falling, and shooting projectile events.
** Game events in this tag are ignored by sculk sensors if the source entity is sneaking.
* Added the <code>vibrations</code> game event tag.
** Contains every game event.
** Game events in this tag trigger sculk sensors.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Pointed dripstone]]'''
* When in a dimension with <code>ultrawarm</code> set to true, such as the [[Nether]], downwards facing dripstone creates lava particles instead of water particles.

=== Items ===
'''[[Bundle]]'''
* Fullness is now always shown even if [[advanced tooltips]] are disabled.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Absorption]] effect'''
* The yellow absorption hearts now stay yellow if the player has the [[Poison]] or [[Wither (status effect)|Wither]] effects, instead of appearing empty.

'''[[Freezing]]'''
* Frozen hearts now appear in [[Hardcore]] mode.
** However, they appear the same as normal frozen hearts.

=== General ===
'''[[Custom dimension]]s'''
* Added <code>height</code> and <code>min_y</code> variables to dimension types, allowing for the height limit to be increased in custom world settings.
** The [[void]] now starts 64 blocks below <code>min_y</code>.

'''Servers'''
* Removed the <code>max-build-height</code> server setting.
