'''Mines''' are worlds that are generated using the [[mine crafter]], introduced in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Generation ==
Each mine is generated randomly if a player chooses each mine ingredient.

== Special mines ==
{{main|Special mine}}
Every 5 mines, a special mine appears in the [[mine crafter]] menu instead of the normal configuration menu. This menu does not allow the player to customize their mine; it just allows the player to start a pre-configured mine. A special mine contains waves of mobs for the player to beat, like [[silverfish]], [[wither skeletons]], [[skeletons]] and bosses like the [[wither]], and allows the player to obtain special mine ingredients from them.

== Mechanics ==
=== Failing a mine ===
Dying in a mine results in failing the mine and respawning in the [[hub]], where a large "mine failed" title appears.

=== Winning a mine ===
Exiting a mine via the [[mine exit]] results in winning the mine. After spawning in the [[hub]], [[experience orbs]] and occasionally (10% chance per mine), the [[shimmering key]] appears near the [[mine crafter]].
