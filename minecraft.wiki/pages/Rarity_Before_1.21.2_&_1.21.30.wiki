Rarity has been significantly reorganized in [[Java Edition 1.21.2]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.30]]. This article covers the rarity system before these changes.

== Displaying ==
Rarity is intended to display anywhere the item name does.

It is shown in the following situations:
* Item tooltips in the inventory
* Item tooltips above the hotbar
* Death messages or {{cmd|give}} command in chat{{Only|je|short=1}}

Rarity colors do ''not'' display in the following cases:
* Item tooltips from an [[item frame]]<ref>{{bug|MC-132199}}</ref>
* Contents tooltips from a [[shulker box]]<ref>{{bug|MC-132201}}</ref>
* Item tooltips in the [[statistics]] screen{{Only|je|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-139386}}</ref>
* The CanPlaceOn/CanBreak tags of an item<ref>{{bug|MC-227915|||Invalid}}</ref>
* Item names in the [[Superflat]] customization screen{{Only|je|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-227928|||Invalid}}</ref>

While the [[ominous banner]] {{in|JE}} displays its name in gold ([[File:Rarity Ominous.png|class=pixel-image]]) for the first two cases above, that is not related to rarity. Items with NBT data cannot be specified for the last three cases.

== Tiers ==
=== Common ===
[[File:Rarity Common.png|class=pixel-image|thumb]]
This rarity applies to all items that don't have a dedicated rarity tier.

{{IN|Be}}, enchanted books are Common rarity.<ref name="books">{{bug|MCPE-184806||Books have the wrong rarity}}</ref>

=== Uncommon ===
[[File:Rarity Uncommon.png|class=pixel-image|thumb]]
This tier mostly contains easier-to-obtain treasure items and materials, as well as some useful equipment.

* {{ItemLink|id=banner-pattern|Creeper Charge Banner Pattern}}
*{{ItemLink|Enchanted Book}}{{fn|{{IN|Java}}, all enchanted books appear as Uncommon, even if they do not store any enchantments, while all other items with the StoredEnchantments tag appear as Common. {{IN|Bedrock}}, enchanted books without any enchantments appear as Common.}}
