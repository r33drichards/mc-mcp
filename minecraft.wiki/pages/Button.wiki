[[File:All Buttons.png|thumb|All buttons currently in the game.]]
A '''button''' is a [[non-solid block]] that produces a temporary [[redstone]] signal and powers its attached block when pressed by a [[player]] or a [[wind charge]]. The material a button is made of affects how long it remains pressed and whether it can be pressed by other means.

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
The crafting recipe is the same for all types and variants of buttons, using a single matching plank, stone, or polished blackstone block to craft the matching button.

{{Crafting
|head=1
|name=[[Wooden button]]
|ingredients=Matching [[Planks]]
|Matching Planks
|Output= Matching Wooden Button
|ignoreusage=1
}}
{{Crafting
|Stone;Polished Blackstone
|Output=Stone Button;Polished Blackstone Button
|ignoreusage=1
|foot=1
}}

=== Natural generation ===
Oak buttons can generate inside [[trial chambers]] between [[dispensers]] with random surprises or loots. {{IN|JE}}, stone buttons can generate inside [[stronghold]]s next to [[iron door]]s. Jungle buttons generate naturally on house walls in [[desert]] [[villages]]. Stone buttons can also generate in [[desert]] [[villages]], in armorer houses attached to [[granite]].

== Usage ==
{{hatnote|For more specific usage, see the individual button pages.}}

=== Redstone power ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}
A button can be used as a [[monostable]] [[Redstone components#Power components|power source]] (it automatically deactivates shortly after being activated).

A stone button stays on for 20 [[tick]]s (1 second), while a wooden button stays on for 30 ticks (1.5 seconds).

==== Placement ====
Buttons can be {{control|placed}} by {{control|using|use}} it on a surface.

They can be attached to the side, bottom and top of any full opaque block.

==== Behavior ====
Buttons are usually in an inactive state, but can be temporarily activated by players. A button can be activated by {{control|using}} it.

While active, a button:
* powers any adjacent [[redstone dust]] to [[Redstone circuit#Power|power level]] 15, including beneath the button (if the button attaches to a vertical surface, or to the bottom of a block)
* powers any adjacent [[redstone comparator]]s or [[redstone repeater]]s facing away from the button to power level 15.
* strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15.
* powers the block of air that it occupies, which in turn is able to power any adjacent redstone components, seemingly sending its power through the air.
* activates any adjacent [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]], including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.

When a button changes state it provides a [[Redstone circuit#Redstone update|redstone update]] to all redstone components adjacent to itself (including above and below), and to all redstone components adjacent to its attachment block.

=== Breaking ===
A button is removed and drops as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed.
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space.{{only|java}}
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space.
