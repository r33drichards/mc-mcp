'''Tiny Agnes''' is a miniaturized doppelgänger of [[Agnes Larsson]], who typically appeared during [[Community Vote|Community Votes]]. Although similar in personality and appearance to her namesake, Tiny Agnes was shown consistently to be a separate entity, spending almost all of her time with [[Tiny Jens]].

== Appearance ==
Tiny Agnes closely follows her inspiration, but with more a more cartoonish appearance. Her hair is blonde in a ponytail, with visible eyelashes and blue eyes. Her clothes are a white T-shirt and jeans with red shoes, however her arms are rendered as nub blocks, while her legs are about as tall as her torso.

Beginning with [[Minecraft Live 2020]], Tiny Agnes would begin wearing different outfits, such as winterwear consisting of purple earmuffs, a white coat, and red gloves or mittens. While snorkeling, she and Tiny Jens would wear near identical outfits, with a snorkel, swimsuit, and flippers. The only difference is hers were accented purple, while his were chartreuse.

In [[Eerie Mojang Office Party]], she's rendered more in-line with typical ''Minecraft'' characters, with proportionate proportions. Her head closely resembles her "Tiny" appearance, but now grown, with the plain clothes taking up far more space.

== Personality ==
Tiny Agnes is commonly paired with Tiny Jens, going on adventures to discover new features that "want to join ''Minecraft''." During these expeditions, she will typically lead the conversation, progressing further than Tiny Jens and acting more fearless.

== Powers and abilities ==
During the [[Biome Chooser]] informal videos, Tiny Agnes was depicted teleporting into a [[forest]] beside what appeared to be a portal. In the [[Biome Vote]] videos, she was also shown both falling into [[Powder Snow|powder snow]] and being able to stand on top fine, without any additional [[Leather Boots|leather boots]]. During the video demonstrating the [[iceologer]], she would display what appeared to be martial arts, instinctively avoiding the [[Dungeons:Ice chunk|ice chunk]] and pulling out a [[crossbow]].

According to a video disclaimer, Tiny Agnes received extensive training for climbing [[Ladder|ladders]] and "water leaping."<ref name=":0">{{YouTube link|O6sXlEwSy1I|Minecraft Live 2023: Mob vote ahoy!|Minecraft|October 2, 2023}}</ref>

== Biography ==
{{Expand section|Add server events}}
During the lead up to [[MINECON Earth 2018]], Tiny Jens and Agnes embarked on a mission to promote the [[Biome|biomes]] players could vote for during the event. Beginning in a [[desert]], Tiny Agnes voiced the opinion that they needed palm trees, "and some [[Meerkat|friendly guys]] to keep things interesting." She corrected Jens when he mistook meerkats for casts, embarrassing to the extent that he ran away to the [[taiga]] in a panic. Upon arriving in the taiga, Tiny Agnes ate a [[Sweet Berries|sweet berry]] and enjoyed it, before a skulk of [[Fox|foxes]] appeared, frightening her. When asked for reassurance they wouldn't be hostile, Tiny Jens remarked that they "hadn't decided." The final destination was the [[savanna]], where she expressed the opinion that [[Baobab|baobabs]] were "the best trees," before shifting her attention to the [[ostrich]].

The following year, Tiny Agnes appeared in a [[badlands]] biome, and encountered vultures. After expressing concerns that "the loot" would [[despawn]]. Moving on into a [[swamp]], Tiny Agnes became grossed out and intimidated by a [[frog]], fleeing from it rather awkwardly. Progressing up into the mountains, Tiny Agnes would fall into powder snow, and then chase after a [[goat]]. The year after shifted to the [[Mob Vote]], where Tiny Agnes found [[Moobloom|mooblooms]] very affectionate, and acted oblivious to Tiny Jens' insecurities. She would get comeuppance of sorts on a return trip to the mountain, freezing cold and nearly getting crushed by an iceologer. While on the mountain, the two would apparently a spend a night on top, In a [[Deep Warm Ocean|deep warm ocean]], Agnes remarked she wished oceans were "glowier," a problem solved by the introduction of [[Glow Squid|glow squids]].

Following the glow squid's victory, 2022 would continue with another mob vote. This time, Tiny Jens and Agnes began trekking through a [[Birch Forest|birch forest]] on their way to the "Minecraft Live Studio," not knowing which mobs were selected. In order to check, Tiny Jens pulled out a cell phone, and contacted Tiny Vu, who conveniently did know the candidates. However, Agnes ended up falling into a [[cave]], leaving Jens to try and locate her.<ref>{{YouTube link|2BCFGjsrwyY|Minecraft Live 2021: Introducing new mobs!|Minecraft|October 10, 2021}}</ref> As it turned out, she had fallen into a laboratory, where she encountered a [[glare]] hiding behind a crate. Digging hole in the ground, she would try to reach out to Jens, leading him down into the underground. In order to escape, the two built a [[Copper Golem|copper golem]], who activated an escape tunnel. Back on the surface, the two rushed to the studio, Agnes disappointed to discover Jens had given their final [[cookie]] to an [[allay]].<ref>{{YouTube link|s58orudNZ94|Minecraft Live 2021: Vote for the next new mob!|Minecraft|October 14, 2021}}</ref>

The final Mob Vote began on a boat, by Jens' insistence. Despite tension over his plan and accusations of lying about a shortcut, Agnes elected to remain positive, insisting on an "adventure" as opposed to "desperation."<ref name=":0" /> Soon, Vu identified a [[Crab|mob]] on a [[Mangrove Swamp|beach]], Agnes proposing it could somehow help them get back on track. Nevertheless, Vu swam over to the biome to investigate, the other two leaving him behind as they reached a savanna island. Confronting Tiny Jens on his supposed shortcut, Agnes unwittingly baits him into riding a [[boat]], on land, for an extended period of time. Now alone, Tiny Agnes pushed forward into the night. After accidentally dropping a [[lantern]] into the sea, she discovered [[Penguin|penguins]], who agreed to help speed up her ship.

The forces reconverged in a [[Cherry Grove|cherry grove]], Vu and Agnes finally finding the apparent shortcut on a [[Hanging Sign|hanging sign]]. The two exchange notes, Agnes telling about her discovery of penguins, while Tiny Vu discusses [[Crab|crabs]]. Meanwhile, Tiny Jens was still rowing through the savanna, following behind them with an [[armadillo]].<ref>{{YouTube link|5GOxXM_HCRM|Minecraft Live 2023: Which mob will you vote for?|Minecraft|October 6, 2023}}</ref>

== Trivia ==

* Despite later canon establishing that the Tinies hail from the [[Adventure Isles]], in the Biome Chooser video for taigas, Tiny Agnes insinuates she is Swedish, like Giant Agnes.<ref>{{YouTube link|ZFxqRX7CPWM|Biome Chooser - Taiga|Minecraft|September 25, 2018}}</ref> This could imply she is an immigrant.
* Although Tiny Agnes voiced the opinion that glow squids would "make oceans glowier," her real self seemed to prefer them in aquifers at the end of ''Minecraft Live 2020''.<ref>{{YouTube link|DWZIfsaIgtE|Minecraft Live 2020: Full Show|Minecraft|October 3, 2020}}</ref>
