{{DISPLAYTITLE:Achievement/Legacy Console & ''New Nintendo 3DS'' editions}}
{{Exclusive|Legacy Console|3ds}}

'''Achievements''' (known as '''trophies''' on PlayStation) are ways to gradually guide new players into ''Minecraft'' and give them challenges to complete. {{IN|JE}}, a system of [[advancement]]s accomplishes this instead.

== Obtaining ==
Every achievement is tracked per user account. They are not tracked separately per world; achievements earned in one world apply to all worlds using that edition and that user account. Achievements are tracked separately on each platform, and do not carry over to other platforms when using the same account.

They are independent of one another, allowing players to get them in any order. Once earned, they cannot be reset.

Non-exclusive [[mini game]] achievements are also available to unlock through the [[tutorial world]]s, [[mini games]], and its [[lobby]].

== Unobtainability ==
There are some conditions which will permanently disable the ability to earn achievements in a world if one or more criteria are met:

* Enabling [[host privileges]].
* Creating a [[superflat]] world.
