'''"Magnetic Circuit"''', also known as '''"calm4"''', is a song by [[Markus Persson]] (aka ''Notch''). It was accidentally included as [[music]] in [[Java Edition Alpha 1.1.1]].

== Track description ==
[[File:Calm4.ogg]]

== History ==
Notch accidentally included <code>calm4.ogg</code> in [[Java Edition Alpha 1.1.1]] when he used it to test the music system.<ref>[https://soundcloud.com/markusalexei/magnetic-circuit Magnetic Circuit] description on SoundCloud — "Uploaded by request. This song was accidentally included in an early build of Minecraft under the name "calm4.ogg" when it was used to test the music system."</ref>

The track is believed to have appeared and disappeared in the downloaded game files multiple times, but exact dates or versions are unknown.{{cn}}

After [[Java Edition Alpha 1.1.2]], <code>calm4.ogg</code> was removed.

With the introduction of the [[Launcher 0.1|1.6.1 launcher]], playing older versions with the track <code>calm4.ogg</code> does not allow the track to be heard, since music is downloaded separately from the jar files.{{dubious|possibly untrue, needs further investigation}}

On February 1, 2020, <code>calm4.ogg</code> was reuploaded by Notch to his [https://soundcloud.com/markusalexei SoundCloud page] under the name [https://soundcloud.com/markusalexei/magnetic-circuit "Magnetic Circuit"] after he was questioned about it.<ref>{{tweet|notch|1223807514564874240|archiveid=20200204171806|Found it: https://soundcloud.com/markusalexei/magnetic-circuit}}</ref>
