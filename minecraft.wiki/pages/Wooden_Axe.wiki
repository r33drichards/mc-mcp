A '''wooden axe''' is an early-game variant of [[axe]] that is crafted from [[planks]]. It can be used to cut down trees faster, to [[Axe#Stripping and scraping|strip]] [[log]]s and [[scrape]] [[Copper#Blocks|copper-based blocks]], and as a melee weapon that disables [[shields]]. It is the seventh-highest [[tier]] of axe, having the lowest [[mining efficiency]], the lowest attack damage alongside [[golden axe]]s, and having the lowest attack speed alongside [[Stone Axe|stone]] and [[copper axe]]s. It can be used as [[fuel]] in a [[furnace]], [[smoker]], or [[blast furnace]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A1 = Any Planks
|B1 = Any Planks
|B2 = Stick
|A2 = Any Planks
|B3 = Stick
|Output = Wooden Axe
|type = Tool
}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|wooden-axe}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
Wooden axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.{{note|Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.}}
<references group="note"/>

=== Stripping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a wooden axe on a [[log]], [[wood]] block, [[Block of Bamboo|bamboo block]] turns it into a [[stripped log]], [[stripped wood]], or [[Block of Stripped Bamboo|stripped bamboo]], respectively. This uses 1 point of the axe's durability.

=== Scraping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a wooden axe on a waxed or somewhat oxidized [[copper]] block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise removes a level of oxidization. This uses 1 point of durability.

=== Weapon ===
When used as a weapon, a wooden axe loses 2 durability points.

==== {{JE}} ====
A wooden axe always disables a shield, although there should be a chance of it happening.<ref>{{bug|MC-197537}}</ref> Damage done by a wooden axe is equivalent to that of a [[diamond sword]], but it has a longer cooldown.

==== {{BE}} ====
Wooden axes attack instantly with no cooldown and do {{hp|1}} less damage than a [[wooden sword]].

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
{{Crafting

|ignoreusage = 1
|ingredients = Damaged Wooden Axe|Damaged Wooden Axe|Damaged Wooden Axe
|Output = Wooden Axe
|description = The durability of the two axes is added together, plus an extra 5% of durability.

==== Unit repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing

}}

A wooden axe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[wooden plank]]s, with each plank restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two wooden axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A wooden axe can receive the following enchantments:
