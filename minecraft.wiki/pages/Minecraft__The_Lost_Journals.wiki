== Synopsis ==
{{q|
[[Max]] and [[Alison]] are proof that differences don’t stand in the way of friendship. Max is always on the lookout for a new adventure—even if it means getting into trouble—while Alison prefers to follow the rules. But both of them are fascinated by the beat-up old journal Max finds and the strange gate its secretive author, the [[Enchanter (The Lost Journals)|Enchanter]], describes: a [[Nether portal|portal]] to an otherworldly realm of danger called [[the Nether]].

After they use the journal’s instructions to craft the portal, Max and Alison squabble over whether to remain safe in the [[Overworld]] or to journey into the Nether to find the Enchanter... until a fateful accident makes the decision for them.

Trapped in a scary new world, Max and Alison find an ally in [[Freya]], a fierce warrior who has been living in the Nether with her beloved wolf, [[Bunny Biter]]. With Freya’s help, and with the clues that lie in the pages of the mysterious journal, Max and Alison embark on a quest to find the Enchanter, even as the Nether pushes their skills—and their friendship—to the limit.|Book description<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-Lost-Journals-Mur-Lafferty/dp/0399180699|title=Minecraft: The Lost Journals: An Official Minecraft Novel|website=Amazon}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/552069/minecraft-the-lost-journals-by-mur-lafferty/9780399180699/|title=Minecraft: The Lost Journals|website=Penguin Random House}}</ref>}}

{{q|Minecraft is one of the best universes to write in because there's little plot involved with the game. So you can tell nearly any story within its "walls" so long as you follow the rules of the world.|Mur Lafferty, author of ''Minecraft: The Lost Journals''<ref>{{Mcnet|the-lost-journals-out-today|The Lost Journals Out Today|July 9, 2019|[[Tom Stone]]}}</ref>}}
