'''Villager No. 5''' is a character originally appearing in ''[[Villager News]]'', a fan made series of comedic shorts by [[Element Animation]] centered around a news show run by [[villager]]s. Following the death of the original protagonist, [https://elementanimation.fandom.com/wiki/Villager_Number_4 Villager No. 4], Villager No. 5 became the main character and has appeared in several official ''Minecraft'' projects.

== Appearance ==
Villager No. 5's most defining trait is a fake<ref name=":Musical">{{YouTube link|tFPcx4X9-e8|VILLAGER NEWS: BREAKING NEWS! 🎵🎵🎵Minecraft Animated Music Video🎵🎵🎵|Element Animation|April 19, 2024}}</ref> mustache, inherited from the late Villager No. 4. His robes are a typical, [[plains]] villager brown coat, however underneath is a toolsmith's apron.

== Personality ==
As the anchorman of Villager News, No. 5 is very committed to spreading knowledge, often shouting in excitement over any given story or situation. Even while not reporting, he is incredibly passionate about his job, muttering about news headlines in his sleep as "current events run around in [his] head."<ref name=":Musical" /> However, he is consistently shown to be rather oblivious and incompetent, taking the fact that a villager hasn't updated to the newest version yet to mean he is vehemently against the prospect of change, and insisting that there is no [[Creaking|monster]] in a forest despite watching several people die to it. 

== Biography ==
In [[VILLAGER (and Pillager?) NEWS]], Villager No. 5 makes very brief appearances at the beginning and end. The video opens on him announcing the coming of the [[Village & Pillage]] update, describing it as having "swept the realm." However, a lone villager (referred to as "Fellow Citizen") has yet to "get the update," meaning they're still a [[Villager (old)|white coated villager]]. Several villagers are under the assumption that this figure is a luddite, openly refusing to update because they "think [they're] better than [them]," with Villager No. 5 transitioning to [[Villager No. 9]] to cover the story.

During [[Minecraft Live 2024]], Villager No. 5 interrupts the broadcast twice. The first time is to warn viewers of the stream that there is a "monster" spotted in the nearby woods by [[Villager No. 15]], sending a troop of villagers led by Villager No. 9 out to investigate, before being interrupted by a [[witch]], in which she says that no one ever returns from the forest. However, the initiative ends up going south, with everyone but Villagers No. 9 and 15 presumed dead. In a panic, he began to cry out for Villager No. 9, only to be met with the sound of [[creaking]].

== Trivia ==
