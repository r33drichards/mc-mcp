The '''minecart with monster spawner''' is a combination of a [[minecart]] and a [[monster spawner]].

== Obtaining ==
Minecarts with monster spawner cannot be obtained as an [[item]] in the [[inventory]], and can only be produced using the {{cmd|summon}} [[command]] or by using external tools.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Monster Spawner#Usage|title1=Monster Spawner}}

The monster spawner within behaves the same way as normal monster spawners, but the [[entity]] to be spawned cannot be set via using [[spawn egg]]s; the monster spawner's data can only be modified using commands or NBT edits. It has the same associated NBT tags as a normal monster spawner.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|299139100638851073}}</ref>

More precisely, a minecart with monster spawner acts as a monster spawner [[block]] at the minecart's position. In other words, if the minecart with monster spawner moved within a block position, the range of spawn would not change, but if it moved 5 blocks east, the range of spawn would now be centered at the minecart with monster spawner's new position.

Minecarts with monster spawner were used in some custom maps as a way to have [[redstone]] controlled monster spawners, however after the addition of the {{cmd|summon}} and {{cmd|setblock}} [[commands]] they were mostly rendered obsolete and are very rarely used today.

== Drops ==
When they are [[Breaking|broken]], minecarts with monster spawners drop 1 {{ItemLink|minecart}}. The monster spawner does not drop.

== Sounds ==
Minecarts with monster spawners use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].<ref group="sound" name="rollsource">{{bug|MC-42132}}</ref>
