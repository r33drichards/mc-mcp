== Additions ==
* Added unbound keybindings for Trim and Remove Air from Selection.

== Changes ==
* Updated the structure panel to allows save while a field is being edited.

== Fixes ==
* Fixed an issue with Freehand select near or outside of dimension bounds that could cause selection to become unusable.
* Fixed issues with selection volumes being able to translate or resize past world bounds. This also fixes using large brush shapes with freehand selection (and magic select) close to a world boundary.
* Fixed a bug that caused Extrude Axis options to be incorrect for Pyramid brush shape.
* Fixed an issue related to files and folders being permanently deleted when deleting structures in the structure panel.
