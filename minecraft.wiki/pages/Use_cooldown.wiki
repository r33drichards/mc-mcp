[[File:Use cooldown.gif|thumb|An example of an item being affected by the use cooldown.]]

The '''use cooldown''' (also known as '''recharge''', '''item cooldown''', or simply '''cooldown''') is a mechanic that delays {{control|using}} an item for a given time. It is represented by a transparent white bar that appears over the item in the [[hotbar]] and [[inventory]].

== Mechanic ==
For most items that are affected by it, the use cooldown triggers after using the item, and is represented by a transparent white bar that decreases in height as the cooldown nears the end of its duration. The use cooldown affects all instances of a given item type that a player has, not just the one that was used. For [[shield]]s specifically, the use cooldown activates when the shield has been disabled by an [[axe]]. For [[spear]]s in {{BE}} specifically, the use cooldown activates after performing a [[jab attack]].

== Affected items ==

* {{ItemLink|Ender Pearl}} (1 second / 20 ticks)
