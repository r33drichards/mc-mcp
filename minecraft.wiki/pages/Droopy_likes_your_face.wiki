{{Q|Not featured in the video on minecraft.net but nontheless completes the song|C418|bandcamp.com}}
{{Q|“Droopy Likes Ricochet” and “Droopy Likes your Face” are both songs from “life changing moments seem minor in pictures”. It’s a song I haven’t created for anything in particular, but the first Droopy song ended up in the first official Minecraft game trailer. I get a lot of questions on what Droopy says. To be fair, I don’t know. It’s a sample library that you receive if you buy Kontakt. As far as I know, it’s a toy you could buy in the 80’s or 90’s which says random phrases about itself.|C418|c418.org}}

'''"Droopy likes your face"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]''.

== Track description ==
Continuing from "[[Droopy likes ricochet]]", "Droopy likes your face"  contains more drums and a wind instrument. Around 0:39, there are samples of the voice storybook [https://www.abebooks.com/9780895120632/Droopy-Dragon-Texas-Instruments-Magic-0895120631/plp The Droopy Dragon], with the lines "Droopy looks in a cave", "No one is there", "Droopy looks under a tree", "Droopy is enormous" repeating throughout the song.

== Trivia ==
* “Droopy likes your face” is also from C418's previous album, [https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/life-changing-moments-seem-minor-in-pictures ''life changing moments seem minor in pictures''].
* According to C418, he doesn't know what the speech samples in “Droopy likes your face” are actually saying. C418 got the speech samples from a Kontakt sample library and they originate from "a toy you could buy in the 80’s or 90’s which says random phrases about itself". The two track titles may be C418's guesses as to what the sounds are saying.
** It has since been discovered that these sounds are from the Texas Instrument Magic Wand Reader reading "The Droopy Dragon", [https://youtu.be/G7SOmfj-hmM as seen here.]
* A remixed mash-up of "Droopy likes ricochet" and "Droopy likes your face" by C418 was released as "Droopy Remembers" for the album [https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/148 ''148''].
