'''<samp>tile.micro_block.name</samp>''' is an item used to shrink the shape of blocks in specific areas of the game into smaller individual blocks for display purposes. Currently, only pre-micro blocks are available in the game.

Pre-micro blocks are generated using the modsdk interface, which creates the corresponding micro block data. Developers can then save this data as a micro block file and integrate it into their [[mod]]. After restarting the game, the micro blocks function similarly to the game's native blocks and can be found and used in the [[item]] list. Debugging addons are used for customizing block combinations, and it is written in the [[wikipedia:Python|Python]] programming language.

== Behavior ==
When holding the [[item]], its [[texture]] is visible; however, upon placing the [[block]], it becomes transparent.

The handheld texture is an [[unknown]] [[texture]], but it is smaller than one pixel compared to the standard [[unknown]] [[texture]].

== Obtaining ==
The block can only be obtained from using {{cmd|/setblock}} or {{cmd|fill}}, by modifying the [[NBT]] data, or through [[addons]].

If this [[block]] is mined directly, it will take 13 minutes; however, using a pickaxe will allow the [[player]] to obtain it as a dropped [[item]].

== Sounds ==
<samp>tile.micro_block.name</samp> uses the [[sound]] [[effect]] of [[stone]].
