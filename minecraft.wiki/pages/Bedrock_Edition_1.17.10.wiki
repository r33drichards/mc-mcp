'''Gameplay'''
* Loot chests with Seed = 0 now correctly randomize if placed on the same coordinates.
** Note that pick blocking a Vanilla loot chest before opening it will now result in identical loot in each copy unless the player set the seed to 0 in the NBT.

'''Data Driven Mobs'''

* Incoming client-sync properties for newly seen types will properly register with client-side Actor Property Manager groups.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "[[Caves & Cliffs]]" and "Enable GameTest Framework" experimental toggle.

=== General ===
* Added the [[Experimental Gameplay|Caves & Cliffs experimental toggle]] for non-beta users.

=== Blocks ===
'''[[Sculk Sensor]]'''
* A redstone component that detects vibrations.
* Currently, it does not generate naturally, but natural generation is planned for future versions.
* Senses vibrations such as block placement, footsteps, and projectiles, and emits a redstone signal.
* [[File:Vibration JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] Emits particles when it senses a vibration nearby.
* A [[Redstone Comparator|comparator]] connected to it emits different signal strengths based on what caused the signal.
* Does not detect ambient [[weather]] such as [[rain]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Goat Horn]]'''
* Dropped by a goat if it rams into a block.
* When used for a short period of time, it makes a sound identical to the horn heard during [[raid]]s.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Completely overhauled.
* Now stretch down to Y=-62.
* Biomes inside of caves introduced such as [[dripstone caves]] and [[lush caves]].
* Contain [[aquifers]], bodies of [[water]] with different heights, independent of sea level (Y=63).
** Aquifers below Y=0 sometimes generate with lava instead of water.
* Improved old caves to blend in with the new generations of caves better.
* New noise caves, coming in 2 forms, cheese, and spaghetti.
** The original caves still exist with their generation slightly tweaked to better blend in with noise caves.
** Cheese caves have large stone towers stretching from the bottom of the cave to the top.
*** Very large, often large enough to fly with an [[elytra]].
*** Abundant with aquifers and [[ore]]s.
** Spaghetti caves are long, thin caves that have small aquifers and are more similar to original caves.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Mineshaft pieces no longer generate if they were fully floating in the air.
* Corridors now generate with wooden [[log]]s as pillars for support, or chains and oak fences as hanging support if needed.
* Cobwebs no longer generate floating without an adjacent block.

'''[[Mountains]]'''
* Height-dependent generation.
* Revamped, featuring some new small [[spruce]] trees on the slopes and [[ice]] and [[packed ice]] above the peaks.
* Contain [[goat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[snow block]]s, [[snow layer]]s, and [[powder snow]].
* [[Iron ore]], [[emerald ore]], and [[coal ore]] are found in abundance.
** Emerald ore no longer generates in blobs of only one.
* Can generate up to Y=256.
* Generates with new sub biomes.

'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Changed ore generation of all ores making them have a spread value like [[lapis lazuli ore]]. Some still retain a linear generation alongside a spread generation.
* [[Coal ore]], [[emerald ore]], and [[copper ore]] no longer generate below Y=0.
** Copper ore generates between the Y=0 and Y=96 and like all other ores, uses spread. It peaks at Y=48.
** Emerald ore generates above Y=32 as a spread, peaking at Y=256 and decreasing in quantity as the [[altitude]] decreases.
** Coal ore attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of Y=96 and generating between an altitude of Y=0 and Y=192.
* Other ores also generate differently.
** [[Iron ore]] attempts to generate three times: once as a spread peaking at an altitude of Y=256, generating above Y=128; another as a spread peaking at Y=16 and generating with a minimum height of Y=-24 and a maximum height of Y=57, and a smaller one spreading evenly between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=-32.
** [[Gold ore]] generates between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=32, peaking at Y=-16. The extra gold that generates in the [[badlands]] biome was left untouched.
** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, as a spread between the altitudes of Y=32 and Y=-32, peaking at an altitude of 0; and evenly between the altitudes of Y=64 and Y=-64, generating buried like [[ancient debris]].
** [[Redstone ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=15 and Y=-64; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of -64 and generating below an altitude of Y=-32.
** [[Diamond ore]] now generate as a spread, generating below Y=16 and peaking at altitudes near y=-64.
* Tweaked size and positioning of [[diorite]], [[andesite]], and [[granite]] generation.
** Pockets of diorite, granite, and andesite are now larger and more spherical but less common.

==== Biomes ====
'''[[Dripstone Caves]]'''
* Can naturally generate in the world.
* Contains [[pointed dripstone]] (both stalactites and stalagmites) and [[dripstone block]]s.
* [[Dripstone cluster|Dripstone clusters]] are abundant here, often forming pillars.

'''[[Lush Caves]]'''
