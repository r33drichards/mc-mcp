'''Jump Boost''' is a [[status effect]] that increases the [[jumping]] height of the bearer.

== Mechanics ==
{{:Calculators/Jump boost|style=float:right; clear:right;}}
Jump Boost increases the jump strength of the player from the base 0.42 blocks/tick (countered by gravity to give the maximum jump height). Each level increases the player's jump velocity by 0.1 blocks/tick. It also reduces one block height in [[fall damage]] calculation each level. 

Arbitrary levels can be set via [[commands]]. {{IN|java}}, negative levels decrease jump height and increase fall damage (which also causes the [[player]] to start taking damage from short falls that would normally do no damage); extreme negative levels eliminate all jumping ability and cause damage even when stepping off a slab.
