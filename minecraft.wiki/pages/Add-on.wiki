[[File:Minecraft Add-Ons Poster.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional artwork for the introduction of add-ons to the [[Marketplace]].]]
An '''add-on''' is a package format and a type of [[downloadable content]] which provides additional custom game features beyond the base game in {{BE}}. It contains a set of {{w|programming interface}}s used for constructing and [[Game customization|customizing]] certain game objects and elements, such as [[entity]], [[block]], [[item]], [[biome]], [[structure]], [[user interface]], and more. It's officially supported by [[Mojang Studios]], which provide the [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/ Creator Documentation] for developers.

Add-ons consist of three main APIs: a [[resource pack]] for managing assets and resources, a [[behavior pack]] for defining [[w:Data-driven programming|data-driven]] behaviors, and the Script API for writing a [[w:Imperative programming|set of procedural instructions]] to perform custom behaviors and interactions. These functions and utilities are used for {{w|video game modding}}.

Add-ons are officially hosted on the [[Marketplace]], where players can download or purchase them on their devices using an in-game digital currency called [[minecoin]]s. They must be submitted by members in the [[Minecraft Partner Program]] and approved by the Minecraft Content Team.

== Overview ==
=== Packs ===
Add-ons can be created with two types of data packs: [[behavior packs]] and [[resource packs]]. Behavior packs can be used to change [[gameplay]] and allow adding and customizing [[Mob AI|entity behaviors]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/entitybehaviorintroduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Entity Behavior Introduction|website=Microsoft Learn|date=September 19, 2023}}</ref> [[loot table]]s,<ref>{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/introductiontoloottables?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Introduction to Loot Tables|website=Microsoft Learn|date=March 6, 2025}}</ref> [[Mob spawning|spawn rules]],<ref>{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/entityreference/examples/cliententitydocumentation/datadrivenspawning?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Data-Driven Spawn Rules|website=Microsoft Learn|date=November 8, 2023}}</ref> [[item]] behaviors,<ref>{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/addcustomitems?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Custom Items|website=Microsoft Learn|date=September 18, 2024}}</ref> item [[recipe]]s,<ref>{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/recipeintroduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Recipe Introduction|website=Microsoft Learn|date=April 19, 2024}}</ref> biome characteristics,<ref name="biome-component-list">{{citation|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/biomes/biomeoverview?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Biome JSON and Overview|website=Microsoft Learn|date=April 10, 2025}}</ref> and much more. Resource packs affect how the game looks and has no effect on gameplay, and they allow adding and customizing [[textures]], [[models]], [[music]], texts, and interfaces.

Definitions are written in [[JSON]] files, which are organized in multiple folders by their features. This system allows users to override and modify certain features in the base game, or add unique features with their own pack.

All contents of an add-on can be packaged together in a zipped {{Cd|.mcaddon}} file. An add-on file can be automatically imported by the game, which will organize all contents in the dedicated directories in {{Cd|[[com.mojang]]}}.

==== Sub-packs ====
Resource packs and behavior packs can contain other packs inside the root, known as sub-packs.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/buildingsubpacks?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Building Sub-Packs|website=Microsoft Learn|date=August 28, 2025}}</ref> A sub-pack has the same format as the main pack and the directory of a sub-pack can have any name. Sub-packs need to be specified in the {{Cd|[[manifest.json]]}} file of the main pack, where a name and minimum memory tier can also be added. For example, a pack can have multiple less resource-intensive sub-packs for lower memory tiers, but it can also be used for other types of settings. The memory tier, affecting which sub-pack is used, can be adjusted in the pack's settings menu in-game.

=== Molang ===
{{main|Molang}}
Molang is a simple expression-based language designed for fast, data-driven calculation of values at run-time, and with a direct connection to in-game values and systems. It is used {{in|BE}} in their add-on system with its purpose being enabling low-level systems like animation to support flexible data-driven behavior for both internal and external creators, while staying highly performant.<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/molangreference/examples/molangconcepts/molangintroduction "Molang Documentation - Introduction to Molang"]</ref>

=== Scripting ===
Scripting is an add-on feature used to write a set of procedural instructions for the game to perform custom behaviors and interactions at certain time or in response to events and actions.<ref>{{citation |url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scripting/introduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable |title=Introduction to Scripting in Minecraft |website=Microsoft Learn |date=July 17, 2025 |archive=1 }}</ref> It lets users control behaviors of entities, blocks, and items; characteristics of the world; or an entire [[w:Video game programming#Game structure|game loop]].<ref name="intro-scripting">{{citation |url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scriptingintroduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable |title=Introduction to Scripting in Minecraft |website=Microsoft Learn |date=April 17, 2025 |archive=1 }}</ref> It is fundamentally different from behavior pack system, the latter uses component system with preset definitions provided by the game.

Script files are written in {{w|JavaScript}} programming language and loaded by the game under the {{cd|scripts}} directory inside an add-on. Users may use {{w|TypeScript}}, a dialect of JavaScript, which provides better error reporting and [[w:Type system#Static type checking|static type system]].<ref name="intro-scripting"/><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html |title=TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers |website=TypeScript |date=June 2, 2025 }}</ref> The Scripting API provides script modules for users to interact with the game, each module must be added as a dependency in the [[manifest.json]], some notable ones are:<ref>{{citation |url=https://wiki.bedrock.dev/scripting/api-modules |title=API Modules |website=Bedrock Wiki |date=June 8, 2025 }}</ref>
<!-- nitpick some notable ones here for introductory/simplicity, don't include everything -->
* {{cd|@minecraft/common}} &ndash; provides common resources, such as error classes or interfaces.
* {{cd|@minecraft/server}} &ndash; provides interactions between the script engine and the game world, such as blocks, entities, items, players, and others.
* {{cd|@minecraft/server-ui}} &ndash; provides players and server communication through customizable forms.
* {{cd|@minecraft/server-net}} &ndash; provides access to the Internet through [[w:HTTP#Request methods|web requests]], such as GET, POST, and others.
* {{cd|@minecraft/server-gametest}} &ndash; provides the [[GameTest]] framework for testing behaviors and interactions within the game world. See {{slink|GameTest|Bedrock Edition}} for further information.
* And other modules, [https://wiki.bedrock.dev/scripting/api-modules further reading].

The Scripting API also provides a way to define and register custom commands.<ref>{{citation |url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/customcommands?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable |title=Scripting Custom Commands Overview |website=Microsoft Learn |date=March 27, 2025 }}</ref>

The Scripting API version 2 is a major update to the Scripting API, which provides new API to define custom components along with other major API changes that aren't backward compatible with the previous version.<ref>{{citation |url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/scripting/v2-overview?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable |title=Scripting V2 Overview |website=Microsoft Learn| date=July 17, 2025 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/customcomponents?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable |title=Introducing Custom Components |website=Microsoft Learn |date=March 27, 2025 }}</ref>

=== Marketplace ===
The [[Marketplace]] is an in-game platform where creators may sell their add-ons to the player base. All Marketplace content must be submitted by members in the [[Minecraft Partner Program]] and approved by the Minecraft Content Team. A purchased content in the Marketplace is synchronized to the player's Microsoft account, and if they are not signed in, it is saved locally on their device.

Add-ons are usually added to the Marketplace every Tuesday (originally Wednesday){{cn|every Tuesday? also, when was it changed?}}, although occasionally appearing on other days. Free add-ons are released as part of special events, for occasions such as to promote the release of ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'' for Minecraft's 15 Years celebration and the eventful [[Movie:McDonald's|McDonald's X ''A Minecraft Movie'']] promotion.<!-- adapted from the removed "History" section of [[Special:PermaLink/1777356]] -->

In addition to the Marketplace, there are community websites dedicated to hosting community-made add-ons, although such add-ons may only be loaded on PCs and phones, whereas consoles can only access those add-ons through [[Realms]].

== Loading tips{{anchor|Warnings}} ==
[[File:Bedrock-modified-world-warning.png|thumb|An example of a loading tip since 1.20.70.21.]]
Extra [[loading tip]] messages would appear if the player is loading a world with add-ons applied. The loading message box is titled "Modified World", and loading tip messages would primarily warn the player about the add-ons or resource packs applied. Here's the list of add-on applied loading tips:

=== Notable histories ===
<!-- these histories may be moved to the HistoryTable -->
'''MINECON introduction'''

Add-on was hinted at in a post by [[Searge]] on August 12, 2016, stating "There will be news about the API at Minecon."<ref>{{tweet|searge|764033531223896064|There will be news about the API at Minecon. I'll talk about the things I'm working on and what our plans are. But no more details for now.|August 12, 2016}}</ref> The next day it was confirmed by [[Grum]] to be a modding API for {{BE}} (formerly called {{PE}}, or ''MCPE''),<ref>{{tweet|_grum|764417838278926336|the MCPE on, would be nice to say that too.|August 13, 2016}}</ref> and at [[MINECON 2016]], the plan and roadmap for the development of add-ons were outlined.

'''Loading tips'''

<!-- the loading tips history may be moved into HistoryTable -->
Extra loading tips that appear when a world has add-ons applied have been added since [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.20.70.21]]. By [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.21.0.23]], eight more of them were introduced which replaced the one from 1.20.70.21.

'''Marketplace'''

Previously, standalone add-ons from the [[Marketplace]] were not available, and needed to be packaged with a world to be sold on the Marketplace. However, as of February 2024, individual add-ons can now be sold separately on the Marketplace.<ref>{{mcnet|introducing-add-ons|Introducing add-ons|February 20, 2024|Linn Viberg}}</ref>
