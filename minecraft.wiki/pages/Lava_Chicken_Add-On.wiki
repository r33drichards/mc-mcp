** Given to the player upon activating the add-on, alongside a message in chat warning the player to not eat it inside. 
** Gives the [[Player|consumer]] the effect of [[Resistance]] 3, forces the player to move forward at a fast speed and leaves a trail of [[fire]] behind them for a few seconds.
** Can be crafted with a [[lava bucket]] (which uses the [[bucket]], unlike crafting a [[cake]]) and [[raw chicken]] to give 4 lava chickens.
