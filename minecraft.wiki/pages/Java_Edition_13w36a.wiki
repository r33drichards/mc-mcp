* Display the name of the item they hold (if it is custom named) when looked at up close.

'''[[Melon]]s '''
* Now generate in jungles.

'''[[Sugar cane]] '''
* Changes color depending on biome. 
** Texture is unchanged, adding biome color makes it appear different.

'''[[Weighted pressure plate]]s '''

=== World generation ===
[[File:Minecraft 1.6 and 1.7 biome map comparison.png|thumb|Comparsion between biome maps of Minecraft 1.6 and 1.7.]]

'''[[Biome]]s'''
* Are now put into four main categories. 
** Snow-covered
** Cold
** Medium
** Dry/Warm
* Biomes attempt to avoid getting placed next to a biome that is too different to themselves.

'''[[Extreme hills]]'''
* Generation tends to include more flat areas, and more extreme mountainous regions.
* Stone is generated more frequently than in the previous versions, even outside of extreme hills+ biomes.

'''[[Ocean]]s'''
* Are now smaller and take up much less of the map.

'''[[River]]s'''
* Now have gravel patches.

'''[[Swampland]]'''
* Grass is greener and fluctuates more in color, depending on biome temperature.
* In shallower parts, the coast is covered in staggered dirt blocks.

'''[[Taiga]]'''
* Taiga biomes no longer receive snowfall below Y=120.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Fishing]]'''
* Changes to the mechanics to make it better.

** Junk: 13 items total, including damaged fishing rods, [[water bottle]]s, [[rotten flesh]], [[string]], [[leather]], [[bowl]]s, [[stick]]s, [[bone]]s, [[tripwire hook]]s, ten stacked [[ink sac]]s, or damaged leather [[boots]].

'''[[Fog]]'''
* The distance where fog appears has been doubled.

=== Command format ===
'''Commands'''
'''{{cmd|give}}'''
* Can now give items to players with custom names and lore.
* It can also give enchanted items.
** Example: {{cmd|give ... {display:{Name:"",Lore:["",""]},ench:[0:{id: ,lvl: }]} }}.
* It can also give items to players with custom NBT data, such as <code>SkullOwner</code> to obtain the [[head]] of a specific player.
** This removes the necessity to use an NBT editing program to obtain these items.
* Attribute modifiers have been added to the {{cmd|give}} command (not completely investigated as of yet).
** Example: To give a diamond sword with +50 attack damage to the nearest player, use the command {{cmd|give @p 276 1 0 {AttributeModifiers:[0:{AttributeName:"generic.attackDamage",Name:"generic.attackDamage",Amount:50,Operation:0,UUIDLeast:894654,UUIDMost:2872}]} }}.
* This enables the possibility of additional attributes to items using commands without the use of an NBT editing program.

'''{{cmd|time set day}}'''
* Now sets the time to 1000 instead of 0.

'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* Can now use [[statistics]] to create objectives; anything that statistics can track can be used as an objective.
* Can also track [[achievement]]s.
** This is the reason why statistics/achievements were changed to be stored per world/server.

** Are now per world/server.
** Added 744 new objective criteria.
* New achievements: "Repopulation", "Adventuring Time", "The Beginning?", "The Beginning.", and "Beaconator".

** Example: "DIAMONDS!" does not appear until "Getting Wood" is achieved.

'''[[Control]]s'''
* Rewrote key configuration.
* Function and [[sprint]] keys can be changed.
** By default, sprinting can be activated by holding down the left control key. 
** In Creative mode, this can also be done while flying.
** The original sprinting controls (double-tap forward or double-tap backward while holding down forward) still function.
* Smooth mouse, formerly available by pressing F8, now uses F4 by default.

'''[[Inventory]]'''
* The display item for the "Decoration Blocks" tab in the Creative mode inventory is the peony.
** Changed from the old rose flower.

'''[[Option]]s'''

* A new "Select Resource Pack" menu.

'''[[Death screen]]'''
* Added a prompt which asks the player if they are sure they want to quit when they die.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* The ability to select multiple resource packs at once.
** Resource packs at the top take precedence over those below.
** Allows for non-manual merging of textures from multiple packs, a sound pack, and a different texture pack, etc.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* New statistics: distance by horse, animals bred, junk fished, treasure fished.
* Rewrite of the system.
* Now ties in with the scoreboard system. 
** Added 744 new objective criteria that were previously tracked with statistics and achievements.
* Are now per world/server.
* Data for a block, item, or mob does not appear in their respective tab in the Statistics screen unless the player has crafted/placed/mined that block, crafted/used/depleted that item, or killed/was killed by that mob.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* The volume of in-game music, [[jukebox]] and [[note block]] music, hostile mobs, passive mobs, players, weather, blocks/environment, and the master volume can now all be modified separately.

'''From the original version of 13w36a'''
* Fixed "weird language selection".<ref name="ninja"/>
* Fixed the names of [[grass block]]s and [[dirt]].<ref>{{bug|MC-29477||Dirt blocks named as tile.dirt.default.name|Fixed}}</ref>
* Attempted to fix a bug with [[mesa]] biomes, but the fix did not work.<ref>{{bug|MC-29446||Mesa biome generation|Fixed}}</ref></onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* Until [[15w31a]], 13w36a held the record as having the most content added to the game in one developmental release, with as much new content in it as the full release of the [[Pretty Scary Update]] had.
* 13w36a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
