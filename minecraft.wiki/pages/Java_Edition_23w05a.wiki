'''23w05a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.4]], released on February 1, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w05a|February 1, 2023}}</ref> which introduces a new design for the "[[Create New World]]" screen, makes all armor trimmable, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added the "Glint Speed" and the "Glint Strength" accessibility options for adjusting the speed and transparency of enchantment glints.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Armor]] and [[elytra]]'''
* Now it is possible to swap an equipped piece of gear with another one by {{control|using}} the latter.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|effect}}'''
* <code>infinite</code> is now a valid option for effect durations.
** Infinite effect durations show up as "∞" in the player inventory view.

=== General ===
[[File:Game 23w05a.png|thumb|"Create New World" screen]]
'''"[[Create New World]]" screen'''
* Now organized into three tabs:
** The ''Game'' tab allows to set the world name, [[gamemode]], [[difficulty]], and whether to allow [[cheats]].
** The ''World'' tab allows to set the [[world type]] and [[world seed]], and to toggle the generation of [[structure]]s and the [[bonus chest]].
** The ''More'' tab provides access to [[game rule]]s, [[experiments]], and the [[data pack]] selection screen.
* Removed the ''Import Settings'' button and the corresponding ''Export Settings'' button in the ''Edit World'' screen.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Changed how [[tooltip]]s in the menu UI are positioned.

== Experimental ==
These changes only take effect when the 1.20 experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Changes ===
==== Items ====
'''[[Smithing template]]s'''
* The following common armor trim smithing templates now always generate 2 each in a chest when found:
** [[Dune armor trim]]
** [[Coast armor trim]]
** [[Wild armor trim]]
** [[Sentry armor trim]]
* [[Netherite upgrade]] smithing templates have been made twice as common.
* 1 [[eye armor trim]] is now guaranteed to generate in every [[stronghold]] library chest.
* [[Woodland mansion]]s now have a greatly increased chance of generating the [[vex armor trim]].
* Across the board, smithing templates have been made slightly more common.
* The texture of the dune armor trim has been tweaked, so that the symbol on the chestplate is moved up a few pixels.

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Armor]]'''
* Armor trims can now be applied to leather armor.
* Armor can now have trims of the same material it is made out of.

==== General ====
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The following data is now also defined by a trim material:
** <code>override_armor_materials</code>: an optional map of armor material to overridden color palette.
*** Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette.
*** Map value is the name of the color palette that will be used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material.
* The following data is no longer defined by a trim material: <code>incompatible_armor_material</code>

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|leather_helmet|leather_chestplate|leather_leggings|leather_boots}} to <code>#trimmable_armor</code> item tag.
