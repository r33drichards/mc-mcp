'''1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1''' (known as '''1_18_experimental-snapshot-1''' in the launcher) is the first [[experimental snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on July 13, 2021,<ref name="article_1.18_experimetal_snapshot_1">{{Mcnet|new-world-generation-java-available-testing|New world generation in Java available for testing|July 13, 2021|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref> which introduces new terrain generation and enables features from the [[Caves and Cliffs Preview Data Pack|preview data pack]]. This version is a fork of [[Java Edition 1.17.1 Pre-release 1|1.17.1 Pre-release 1]]. This is the first experimental snapshot released in 2021.

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''{{EnvLink|Cave|text=Caves}}'''
* Completely overhauled.
* Now stretch down to Y=-59.
* The cavern now generates in 2 layers of different stone bases depending on the depth.
** Cavern layer above Y=0 is made up of regular [[stone]].
** Stone transitions to [[deepslate]] from Y=0 to Y=-7.
** Deepslate now completely replaces stone from Y=-8 to [[bedrock]].
*** Certain types of ores and structures still generate in the deepslate layer, as well as [[tuff]].
*** [[Dirt]], [[diorite]], [[granite]] and [[andesite]] do not generate in this layer.
* Contain [[aquifers]], bodies of [[water]] with different heights, independent of sea level (Y=63).
** Aquifers below Y=0 sometimes generate with lava instead of water.<ref name="21w16a">{{snap|21w16a|April 21, 2021}}</ref>
* Improved old caves, adding more variation.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1364649861761630209|Oh forgot to mention in the changelog* we also added some more variation to the old cave carvers (width, heigh, floor cutoff, etc). Just to make them blend in a bit better with the noise caves instead of being instantly recognizable.|February 25, 2021}}</ref>
* New noise caves, coming in 3 forms: cheese, spaghetti, and noodle.
** The original caves still exist with their generation slightly tweaked to better blend in with noise caves.
** Cheese caves have large stone towers stretching from the bottom of the cave to the top.
*** Very large, often large enough to fly with [[elytra]].
*** Abundant with [[spring]]s, aquifers and [[ore]]s.
** Spaghetti caves are long, thin caves that have small aquifers and are more similar to original caves.
** Noodle caves are thinner, squigglier and more claustrophobic variants of spaghetti caves.

'''{{EnvLink|Mountain|text=Mountains}}'''
* Come in 5 sub-biomes:
** {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
*** A flat but elevated biome that looks like a flowery and colder [[plains]], with an aqua [[grass]] color and dark blue water color.
*** Generates in plateaus and the lowest layers of some mountains, usually near plains and other temperate biomes.
*** Contains [[grass]], [[tall grass]], [[dandelion]]s, [[azure bluet]]s, [[cornflower]]s, [[blue orchid]]s, [[poppies]], [[oxeye daisies]] and [[allium]]s.
*** Only [[rabbit]]s and [[donkey]]s spawn in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Grove}}
*** Reminiscent of a [[snowy taiga]] with snow blocks instead of [[grass block]]s.
*** Generates in the slopes of a snowy mountain when next to forested biomes.
*** Covered in [[snow]], [[snow block]]s, [[powder snow]] and is filled with [[spruce tree]]s.
*** Rabbits, [[wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[cow]]s spawn in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes}}
*** Generates in the slopes of a mountain when next to plains and snowy tundras.
*** Covered in snow layers, snow blocks, powder snow and [[ice]].
*** Only rabbits and [[goat]]s spawn in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Jagged Peaks|text=Lofty Peaks}}
*** One of the biomes that generate in the mountain peaks.
*** Covered in snow, snow blocks and [[ice]].
*** Only goats spawn in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Frozen Peaks|text=Snowcapped Peaks}}
*** One of the biomes that generate in the mountain peaks.
*** Generates if the surrounding biomes are too cold for lofty peaks.
*** Covered in snow, snow blocks, ice, and [[packed ice]].
*** Only goats spawn in this biome.

'''{{EnvLink|Ore Vein|text=Ore Veins}}'''
* Long and rare [[ore]] formations.
* [[Copper ore]] veins mixed with [[granite]] and [[raw copper block]] generate above Y=0.
* [[Iron ore]] veins mixed with [[tuff]] and [[raw iron block]] generate below Y=0.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Added two new lines: "Multinoise" and "Terrain".
** Only appear if the dimension where the player is uses the multi-noise biome source type.
** Multinoise lists the parameters used at the player's position in order to place a biome. C is continentalness, E is erosion, T is temperature, H is humidity and W is weirdness.
** Terrain lists values related to terrain generation.{{Info needed}}

** Ice spikes, eroded badlands and savanna plateau were added back in 1.18 experimental snapshot 2.<ref name="tweet_henrikkniberg_1415591066179342336"/>
** Jungle edge was added back in 1.18 experimental snapshot 5.

[[File:1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1 approximate ore distribution.jpg|thumb|300px|The new ore generation for 1.18 Experimental Snapshot 1.]]
'''Ore distribution'''
* Changed ore generation of all ores making them have a spread value like [[lapis lazuli ore]]. Some still retain a linear generation alongside a spread generation.
* [[Coal ore]], [[emerald ore]], and [[copper ore]] no longer generate below Y=0.
** Copper ore generates between Y=0 and Y=96 and like all other ores, uses spread. It peaks at Y=48.
** Emerald ore generates above Y=32 as a spread, peaking at Y=256 and decreasing in quantity as the [[altitude]] decreases.
** Coal ore attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of Y=96 and generating between an altitude of Y=0 and Y=192.
* Other ores also generate differently.
** [[Iron ore]] attempts to generate three times: once as a spread peaking at an altitude of Y=256, generating above Y=128; another as a spread peaking at Y=16 and generating with a minimum height of Y=-24 and a maximum height of Y=57, and a smaller one spreading evenly between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=72.
** [[Gold ore]] generates between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=32, peaking at Y=-16. The extra gold that generates in the [[badlands]] biome was left untouched.
** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, as a spread between the altitudes of Y=32 and Y=-32, peaking at an altitude of 0; and evenly between the altitudes of Y=64 and Y=-64, generating buried like [[ancient debris]].
** [[Redstone ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=15 and Y=-64; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of -64 and generating below an altitude of Y=-32.
** [[Diamond ore]] now generate as a spread, generating below Y=16 and peaking at altitudes near Y=-64.

'''General'''
* [[Terrain]] generation is now independent from [[biome]]s, with biomes adapting to whatever [[terrain]] they happen to generate throughout.<ref>{{YouTube link|6Ffu1gTEsVo|Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot|Henrik Kniberg|July 13, 2021|name=}}</ref>
** This allows for natural variation in the terrain of any individual biome, both in terms of shape and elevation.
*** For example, [[forest]]s and [[desert]]s could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that purpose.
** This additionally allows for smoother transitions between biomes.
* [[Terrain]] is now smoother and more extreme.

=== General ===
'''[[Height limit]]'''
* Has been increased to 384 blocks, expanding 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, with 320 being the limit upward and -64 being the limit downward.

'''[[World type]]s'''
* "[[Large Biomes]]" and "[[AMPLIFIED]]" worlds can no longer be created.</onlyinclude>

== Fixes ==
* {{bug|MC-126009}} could be considered fixed by this version.

== Issues ==
This version is not supported on the bug tracker, and therefore issues affecting it will be resolved as "Invalid".<ref>{{bug|MC-231984}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* This is the first time that the light level requirement for common hostile mob spawning has been changed for more than 10 years. The "light level 7 and below" rule was originally implemented on [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100204-2027|February 4, 2010]], while the game was still in its [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] phase, and remained constant since with the exception of [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0]] through [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0_02]], where the restrictions were height based.
* This is not the first "experimental snapshot", as it was preceded by [[Java Edition Combat Tests]], but this is the first one to be available on Minecraft.net and the first to lead to [[Java Edition 21w37a|a proper snapshot]].
* This is the first time the terrain has been changed since [[Java Edition 1.13]] in 2018, and is the first time the terrain has been completely overhauled since [[Java Edition 1.7.2]] in 2013.
* Unlike later experimental snapshots, the title of this version is in title case.
