{{IN|bedrock}}, a new UI design system is being developed using the Gameface engine (formerly Hummingbird<ref name="gameface-former-hummingbird">{{cite|url=https://wiki.bedrock.dev/meta/gametest-qna.html#hummingbird-ui|title=GameTest Q&A 2021/08/06|website=Bedrock Wiki}}</ref>) by Coherent Labs,<ref name="react-advanced-2021-ore-ui"/><ref name="dotjs-hummingbird-tech-preview">{{ytl|qDevZETe8OE|dotJS 2018 - Tobias Ahlin - Adding JavaScript to Minecraft|March 4, 2019}}</ref><ref name="powered-by-coherent-labs">{{cite|url=https://www.coherent-labs.com/powered-by-coherent-labs/|title=Powered by Coherent Labs|website=Coherent Labs}}</ref> which made it possible to run modern web technology such as {{w|JavaScript}}, {{w|HTML}} and {{w|CSS}}.<ref name="coherent-gameface-product">{{cite|url=https://www.coherent-labs.com/products/coherent-gameface/|title=Coherent Gameface|website=Coherent Labs}}</ref>

== Development ==
=== ''Bedrock Edition''{{'}}s UI redesign tech preview ===
On November 9, 2018, [[Tobias Ahlin]], the lead experience designer at Mojang Studios, announced a UI overhaul coming to {{BE}} built on Hummingbird engine, which runs a subset of {{w|HTML}} and {{w|CSS}}, and a design system built with {{w|React}}.<ref name="dotjs-hummingbird-tech-preview"/> A tech preview for {{BE}} title screen redesign featuring a user-friendly input for touch, controller, and keyboard was shown at the dotJS 2018 developer conference.

[[File:DotJS 2018 Bedrock's UI redesign tech preview.png|thumb|{{BE}}'s UI redesign tech preview, shown in dotJS 2018 developer conference]]
The new title screen from the tech preview features two pages. The top page shows the player's last played world, with the background UI that changes to match the world's thumbnail. The bottom page shows five interactable buttons and their actions possibly:
* "Play" which lets the player navigate to the [[Select World]] screen.
* "Store" which lets the player navigate to the store (similar to the modern [[Marketplace]]).
* "Skins" which lets the player change their [[skin]] (similar to the modern [[Character Creator]]).
* "Achievements" and "Settings" which let the player view their [[achievement]]s and [[setting]]s.

There is also a profile button (with the player's profile picture) on the top right corner, which likely lets the player navigate to their [[profile screen]].

The website for ''Minecraft'' JavaScript API documentation was once available through a link which can be seen near the end of the talk; the documentation provides the page to the tech preview where users could freely interact with the redesigned user interface.<ref name="dotjs-hummingbird-tech-preview"/> The original link for the documentation now redirects to a completely different website, making the documentation inaccessible; it is now considered {{w|lost media}} as it has not been archived elsewhere.

In [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.16.100.50|beta 1.16.100.50]], released on July 31, 2020, the new [[achievement]]s screen was added. It was rolled out initially for 5 percent of the player base.<ref name="achievement-new-ui-rollout">{{tweet|Volgar|1289257749751058432|Uh-oh! I think I pressed something, and now 5% of #Minecraft beta users will see the new achievements screen. Well, might as well ask for feedback here: https://aka.ms/mcAchievementBeta.|July 31, 2020}}</ref> For the next 9 weeks, the number of players who could access the new achievement UI gradually increased from 5% to 75%.<ref name="achievement-new-ui-rollut-75">{{tweet|Volgar|1337166293431169024|I'll provide more context later, but... jam. It gets everywhere. Hence, a whopping 75% of #Minecraft players have a chance to see the new achievements screen both in the latest release and the latest beta. Stay tuned! Ta-tah!}}</ref>

In the following years, more JSON UI [[Menu screen|menu screens]] were gradually refreshed with Ore UI, with design previews available in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'' before full release in usually a few months. The internal resources for Ore UI include a texture atlas containing revamped textures for in-game GUIs, such as the [[inventory]]. These have been teased to be in early development.

=== React Facet ===
On October 18, 2021, the React Facet source code was published on [https://github.com/Mojang/ore-ui Ore UI GitHub repository] under the {{w|MIT License}}.<ref name="github-ore-ui-react-facet">{{cite|url=https://github.com/Mojang/ore-ui/commit/96c107cea826379efbd76342fdf1e37789b53b36|title=Importing codebase from internal repository (#1) · Mojang/ore-ui@96c107c|website=GitHub}}</ref>

On October 25, 2021,<ref name="react-advanced-ragonha-talk-date">{{cite|url=https://reactadvanced.com/2021/#schedule|title=Schedule|website=React Advanced}}</ref> Paulo Ragonha, a tech lead at Mojang Studios, introduced React Facet, an {{w|Observer pattern|observable}}-based state management for video game user interface built in React.<ref name="react-advanced-2021-ore-ui">{{ytl|Vyg1oQI1VaA|Using React to Build Performant Game UIs in Minecraft - Paulo Ragonha, React Advanced 2021|December 27, 2021}}</ref> This was announced at the React Advanced 2021 developer conference. In the talk, Ragonha showcases how React Facet bridges game data by introducing a system that connects the {{w|Frontend and backend|backend}} C++ game engine (where the game's states reside) with the {{w|Frontend and backend|frontend}} JavaScript UI. This connection relies on a concept called "facets", which are lightweight observable objects representing slices of the game's state. These facets allow the UI to subscribe to specific pieces of data from the game engine, such as player health, inventory, or environmental changes, and receive real-time updates as the state changes in the game.

== Design system ==
The Ore UI design system can be found inside the Ore UI Developer Page section in the Minecraft Bedrock Developer Mode.

== Usage ==
The menu screens updated with Ore UI implemented new features using the design system, such as informative (and sometimes humorous) descriptions, smaller fonts for readability, clearer and modern layouts, more responsive sliders, more different types of elements, and tags. The buttons are styled similarly to JSON UI, with updated looks, pressing animations, and exclusive sounds for progressive buttons. Certain menus have received additional animations and images, and all UI textures have been updated, including controller hints.

Unlike JSON UI, Ore UI menus are separated into sections containing the elements. Depending on the UI scaling, each section is individually scaled, leaving gaps for the [[panorama]] in smaller scales, while some elements like the top navigation bar remain responsive. Dropdown buttons, which open an options pop-up, are replaced with always visible toggle buttons on smaller UI scales. Ore UI supports an additional accessibility scaling option to increase the scaling.

Ore UI is currently used in the following [[menu screen]]s (including sub-menus):

| Aims for better performance, though some users have reported micro-freezes and lag issues, particularly on consoles.
|-
! Availability
| Available by default on screens that are not yet migrated to Ore UI.
| Available on few select screens ([[Select World#Bedrock Edition|Play]], [[Settings]], [[Create New World#Bedrock Edition|Create World]], and [[Achievement]]s). Though it may fallback to legacy JSON UI on specific cases.{{info needed}}
|-
! Accessibility
| Limited built-in scaling.
| Better support for different screen sizes.
|-
! Visuals
| Pixel-perfect scaling; classic layout.
| Modern visuals, but cited for blurry text and clunky button spacing.
|-
! Technology
| Data-driven using [[JSON]] files.
| Developed using modern web technology ({{w|JavaScript}}, {{w|HTML}}, {{w|CSS}}) and the Gameface engine by Coherent Labs.
|-
! Technical details
| UI elements are defined in resource pack, specifically under {{cd|<resource pack>/ui}} directory.
| UI elements are defined internally in the [[Content|game's installation files]], specifically under {{cd|Content/data/gui/dist/hbui}}.
