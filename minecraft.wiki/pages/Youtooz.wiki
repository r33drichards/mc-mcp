| rowspan="7" |"Sitting at 4.2 inches tall with clouds of purple smoke pluming from their closed mouth, two grey horns sit above furrowed glowing eyes as spines run down their long back and onto a curling tail. With two pointed wings extending from their back and curing around their sides, all four legs are planted solidly on the ground as their body is covered in small scales. The exterior of their packaging sees the Ender Dragon readying to unleash a fearsome beam from its mouth. While the interior is a deep purple [[End sky|sky]] over a light [[End Stone|soul stone]] [[The End|world]], this then continues onto the protective sleeve as their figure can be seen through the large clear window at the packaging’s front. This collectible ships in a matte, embossed, protective outer sleeve and a custom-sized plastic protector for maximum protection during shipping."
