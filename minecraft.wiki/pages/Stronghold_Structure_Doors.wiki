Stronghold doors are the separating sub-structures that generate between the various rooms in [[strongholds]].

There are 4 types of door: the plain empty 3×3 opening, the grate of iron bars, the wooden door and the iron door. They are generated randomly, with equal chance between them except for the empty opening which is twice as likely. They are generated only as entrances of rooms: this way the game prevents double back-to-back doors from generating (as exit of one room plus entrance of the subsequent room).

The wooden and iron doors always face the direction the stronghold generates toward, meaning a door flush with the wall always leads away from the starting staircase, and a door indented into the wall leads toward the starting staircase. <!-- Took from main page -->
