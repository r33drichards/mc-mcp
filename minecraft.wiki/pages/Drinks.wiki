'''Drinks''' are a narrow selection of consumable [[item]]s that the player can drink in an extremely similar manner to [[food]]. Drinks can be distinguished from food by the sounds they make upon consumption and the lack of particles emitted by consuming them. They also do not require the hunger bar to be depleted, and do not affect hunger or saturation values upon use (with the exception of [[honey bottle]]s, which is considered both a drink and a food item).

Drinks are drunk by holding {{control|use}} while having the drink [[item]] selected in the hotbar or in the offhand{{only|JE}}.
