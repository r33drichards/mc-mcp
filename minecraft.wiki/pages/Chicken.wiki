A '''chicken''' is a [[passive mob]] found in most grassy [[biome]]s, and the main source of [[raw chicken]], [[feather]]s and [[egg]]s. They have three variants based on the [[temperature]] of the biome they [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in.

== Spawning ==
Chickens [[Mob spawning|spawn]] naturally in the [[Overworld]] in most grassy biomes except [[snowy plains]], [[meadow]]s, [[cherry grove]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, and [[pale garden]]s.

Each chicken has a 5% chance of spawning as a [[baby]].

{{IN|java}}, chickens spawn in groups of 4 on [[grass block]]s in any light level. 
Individual chickens rarely may spawn after [[world generation]].

{{IN|bedrock}}, chickens spawn in groups of 2-4 on grass blocks in a light level of 7 and more. 
Individuals regularly spawn after world generation.

{{IN|java}}, chickens are more common in [[sparse jungle]]s.

{{IN|Java}}, chickens may be found in [[the Nether]] when a baby [[zombified piglin]] spawns as a [[chicken jockey]]. This can also happen with every other baby variant of the [[zombie]].

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Variants ===
{{Redirect|Chicken variant|the definition of chicken variants in data packs|Mob variant definitions#Chicken}}

Chickens have 3 variants: temperate, cold, and warm. The variant is determined by the biome the chicken spawns in.

{{Farm animal variants}}

If a chicken is spawned via [[spawn egg]], command or jockey in any biome not listed, a temperate chicken is spawned.

=== Chicken jockey ===
[[File:Chicken Jockey.png|thumb|150px]]
==== ''Java Edition'' ====
{{main|Chicken Jockey}}
All baby [[zombie]] variants and baby [[zombified piglin]]s have a 5% chance to check for an existing chicken within a 10×6×10 box centered on the baby's spawn location and spawn riding one of those chickens if there are any. If it fails that 5% chance, there is an additional 5% chance of the baby zombie spawning mounted on a new adult chicken. If a jockey spawns riding a new chicken, the [[#Variants|variant]] of the chicken depends on the biome it spawns in.

Because a baby zombie occurs from 5% of zombie spawns, the chicken jockey spawns consist of 0.2375% of all zombie spawns in a chicken-free environment; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%. A chicken jockey can also be spawned by using the following command: 

{{Cmd|/summon minecraft:chicken ~ ~ ~ {IsChickenJockey:1b,Passengers:[{id:"minecraft:zombie",IsBaby:1b}]<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} 

Chicken jockeys may spawn with items equipped. Baby zombified piglin versions of the chicken jockey always wield a [[golden sword]]. Harming or killing the chicken does not cause the zombified piglin to attack.

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
Baby zombie jockeys do not spawn riding chickens, but check for nearby adult chickens to mount prior to attacking a player, [[wandering trader]], adult [[villager]], [[snow golem]], or [[iron golem]].

== Drops ==
{{Main|Tutorial:Egg farming#Chicken farming and cooking}}

Adult chickens that were not part of chicken jockeys lay an [[egg]] every five to ten minutes.

=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} experience orbs upon a successful [[breeding]].

=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Raw Chicken|notes=not_burn|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Cooked Chicken|notes=burn|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Feather|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
{{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs are dropped when a chicken is killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]] or {{xp|10}} if it was part of a [[chicken jockey]]{{only|java|short=1}}.

Killing a baby chicken yields no [[item]]s or [[experience]].

Killing a [[zombie]] riding a chicken will result in the [[Music Disc Lava Chicken|music disc "Lava Chicken"]] dropping.

== Behavior ==
A chicken normally wanders aimlessly when idle. Sometimes they remain in a small area, even if it's just a 1 block space. They follow players holding various seeds within a 6×4×6 cubic area. Baby chickens follow adult chickens.
[[File:Chicken following seeds.png|thumb|Chickens following a player holding [[wheat seeds]].]]
Chickens avoid falling off cliffs (>3.5 blocks). They flap their wings when they are in midair and fall slowly, thus chickens are immune to fall damage.

Chickens can be attached to [[lead]]s.

When harmed, chickens flee around for a few seconds.

Unlike other mobs, chickens attempt to jump up to climb stairs instead of climbing them normally.<ref>{{bug|MC-95818}}</ref> 

[[Ocelot]]s, untamed [[cat]]s{{only|java|short=1}}, and [[fox]]es pursue and attack chickens. While chickens do flee when attacked, they otherwise make no attempt to avoid foxes.

While in a loaded [[chunk]], an adult chicken lays an [[egg]] every five to ten minutes (6000–12000 [[tick]]s), unless it is, or was, a part of a [[chicken jockey]]. If the player is close enough to a chicken when it lays an egg, a pop sound is heard.

Chickens can stay underwater for 15 seconds or can swim, visibly flapping their wings and staying on the water surface. While swimming, a chicken needs only one block of air above its head.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}

Chickens follow players holding [[wheat seeds]], [[beetroot seeds]], [[melon seeds]], [[pumpkin seeds]], [[torchflower seeds]], or [[pitcher pod]]s but stop following when separated from the player by at least 10 blocks{{Only|JE}} / 16 blocks{{Only|BE}}. Additionally, baby chickens follow adults.

A player can [[breed]] chickens by using [[seeds]]. After breeding, a baby chicken spawns and 1–7 [[experience]] is generated. The parents cannot be bred again for 5 minutes. The variant of the offspring is inherited from one of the parents and does not depend on the biome they are bred in.

[[File:Minichicken.png|thumb|left|A baby chicken with its parents.]]

Baby chickens take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} seeds. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up. A baby chicken fed a seed once per second grows up in approximately 48 seconds using 47 seeds.

Baby chickens are smaller than a half-block and can unwillingly pass through openings smaller than a full block, but do not walk through half-block-tall spaces. A baby chicken riding a [[minecart]] cannot be hit because it is completely inside the minecart's [[hitbox]].

=== Eggs ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Egg farming#Chicken farming and cooking}}
Chickens are the only [[Overworld]] mob that can repopulate without breeding. Adult chickens lay eggs every 5-10 minutes and an [[egg]] thrown at the ground by a player or a [[dispenser]] has a {{frac|1|8}} chance of spawning a baby chicken. If a baby chicken spawns from a thrown egg, there is a further {{frac|1|32}} chance to spawn three extra baby chickens, or {{frac|1|256}} overall. It is theoretically possible for a stack of 16 eggs to yield 64 chickens if all spawn chances succeed for all eggs.

Different variants of chickens lay different types of eggs:
*{{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Temperate chickens lay [[Egg|regular eggs]] 
*{{EntitySprite|Warm Chicken}} Warm chickens lay [[Egg#Brown|brown eggs]]
*{{EntitySprite|Cold Chicken}} Cold chickens lay [[Egg#Blue|blue eggs]]

If the [[player]] throws an [[egg]] at a [[glass pane]], the baby chicken can spawn on the far side of the pane.

== Trivia ==
*When a chicken is killed off a ledge, the corpse also falls more slowly than normal and the wings continue flapping.
*Chickens can "hide" within [[hopper]]s due to their small size, which protects them from dangers like [[lava]] on top of the hopper.
*A few weeks before the end of [[Java Edition Beta]], [[Notch]] tweeted that he had changed the chickens to ducks,<ref>{{tweet|notch|129820154359062528|Also, the chicken is now a duck.|October 28, 2011}}</ref> causing a turmoil on [[wikipedia:Twitter|Twitter]]. A few days later, [[Jeb]], still receiving feedback on the idea, stated that it was just a joke.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|131712942122086400|@NationalStupid1 It was a joke|November 2, 2011}}</ref> Later on, Mojang rejected the idea of adding ducks to ''Minecraft''.<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360005029872-Previously-Considered-Suggestions|title=Previously Considered Suggestions|website=feedback.minecraft.net|date=May 7, 2020}} </ref> However, ducks were added into ''Minecraft Dungeons''.
**The changelog for [[Pocket Edition v0.3.0 alpha]] referred to chickens as ducks.<ref>{{Cite|url=http://www.mojang.com/2012/04/minecraft-pocket-edition-now-with-crafting|title=Minecraft – Pocket Edition Now with Crafting!|author=Daniel Kaplan|website=Mojang.com|date=April 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426225033/http://www.mojang.com/2012/04/minecraft-pocket-edition-now-with-crafting}}</ref>
**[[Notch]] later referred to chickens in a [[The Word of Notch|blog post]] as "the Chicken/duck/whatevers".<ref>{{Tumblr|notch|28188312756|Gender in Minecraft|July 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728170757/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft}}</ref>
**During [[Minecraft: Story Mode|''Minecraft: Story Mode'']], {{MCSM|Petra}} at one point questions whether {{MCSM|chicken}}s are ducks.
