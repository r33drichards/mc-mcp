'''13w39a''' is the eighth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], released on September 26, 2013.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w39a/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w39a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 13w39a|author=[[Dinnerbone]]|website=Mojang.com|date=September 26, 2013}}</ref> It adds [[red sand]] to mesa biomes and allows for more than one enchantment on a book. 

The server was reuploaded just over an hour after release.{{more info}}

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Red Sand JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Red sand]]'''
* Generated on the lowest surface levels of the mesa biome.
* Behaves like normal sand.
* Can be smelted into [[glass]] and crafted into [[TNT]], but cannot be crafted into [[sandstone]].

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart with command block]]'''
* Can only be obtained using {{cmd|give @p 422}}, {{cmd|give @p hopper_command_block}} or {{cmd|summon MinecartCommandBlock}}.
* Activated by [[activator rail]]s.
** Run their command every so often as long as they are powered - a command block minecart going across a single powered activator rail at full speed runs its command thrice.
* Can be success-tested while on a [[detector rail]] with a [[redstone comparator]] next to the rail (just like how the minecart with chest and minecart with hopper can be fill-checked).

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Enchanted book]]s'''
* Can now give multiple enchantments.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Badlands]]'''
* [[Orange terracotta]] generates in place of sandstone, but not in the same type of formation.

=== General ===
'''Logging'''
* Now done using Log4j 2.
** Default logging location is now in logs/latest.log, older logs are archived in logs/year-months-day-counter.log.gz with GZIP compress. The year is 4 digits, and the month and day are both 2 digits. The counter is the number of startups on the day. The counter is 1 when the first startup of the day and increasing each startup.
** The way logs are saved can be changed, examples: HTML page, database, errors only, no logging at all.
** As a result, this is the first version to be affected by the [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-message--security-vulnerability-java-edition Log4Shell security vulnerability], although running the game through the current launcher will automatically apply a patch to fix it.
