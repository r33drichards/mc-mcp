'''Crawling''' is a mechanic<ref name=official>{{Mcnet|how-crawling-came-minecraft|How Crawling Came to Minecraft|7/21/2020|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1113084315615793152|I'm sorry Steve. It's for science!|April 2, 2019}}</ref> that prevents the [[player]] from suffocating when inside small gaps. Crawling covers a pose that occurs when the player is in an area less than 1.5 blocks high.

== Entering crawling ==
A player cannot crawl when there is no risk of suffocation. Crawling is initiated automatically in any situation that would cause the [[player]]'s head to intersect a [[block]] in such a way that the area underneath the block is less than 1.5 blocks. For example:

* Closing a [[trapdoor]] on the player
* Closing a [[fence gate]] when it is at the same [[altitude]] as the player's head
* Using a [[piston]] to push a block into the player
* Exiting [[swimming]] mode in a one-block-high space
* Exiting [[elytra]] mode in a one-block-high space
* Having a [[tree]] grow over a player
* Throwing an [[ender pearl]] into a one block space
* Having a [[shulker box]] push the player down
** This normally makes the player sneak instead of crawl, but when it is above a [[slab]] or a not-full block, then the player crawls.
* Getting off a [[pig]] with a [[saddle]] if it's under a one-block-high space
* Having a [[boat]] land on the player's head
* Waking up from a [[bed]] placed in a two-block-high space, with no space to the side of the bed

In these circumstances, the player automatically switches to a crawling state. When enough space opens up above the player's head, the player automatically exits this state and begins standing again. In the crawling form, the player is reduced to 0.625 blocks tall, or {{frac|5|8}} of a block, meaning that they can crawl over blocks 0.375 blocks tall, or {{frac|3|8}} blocks tall, the height of a [[daylight detector]].

When crawling, the player travels at [[sneaking]] speed. The speed of crawling can be increased with the [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment.
The speed can also be increased by sprinting before entering the crawling state. This raises the speed by 30%.

Crawling players can still produce footstep sounds<ref>{{bug|MC-248309||Crawling players can produce footstep sounds|WAI}}</ref> and alert [[Sculk Sensor|sculk sensor]]s; both of these effects can be eliminated by pressing the {{ctrl|sneak}} key while crawling.
