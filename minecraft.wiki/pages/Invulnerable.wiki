{{Disambiguation}}

'''Invulnerable''' or '''invincibility''' commonly refers to an ability which makes entities impossible to kill or destroy in ''Minecraft'', except for special cases (such as through [[command]]s or [[void]] death). There are several pages which discuss this:

== ''Minecraft'' ==
* [[Entity#Data values|Entities' {{nbt|bool|Invulnerable}} tag]], which makes entities invulnerable from any source of [[damage]], except from players in [[Creative]] mode.
* [[Player#Entity data|Players' {{nbt|bool|invulnerable}} ability]] in the {{nbt|compound|abilities}} data, which makes players invulnerable from any source of damage except the [[void]].
* {{slink|Damage|Invulnerability timer}}, a short half-second invulnerability against most source of damage after sustaining another damage from any source.

== ''Minecraft Dungeons'' ==
* {{mcd|Invulnerability}}, an {{mcd|effect}} that prevents the {{mcd|hero}} from taking damage.
