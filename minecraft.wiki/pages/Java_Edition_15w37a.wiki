'''15w37a''' is the twenty-third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on September 10, 2015.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/09/minecraft-snapshot-15w37a/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
==== [[Biome]]s ====
'''{{BiomeLink|The Void}}'''
* Now a biome with id 127.
** No [[mob]]s randomly spawn in the biome.
** Generates a single structure: a stone platform with a cobblestone center block at spawn.

'''{{EnvSprite|Superflat}} [[Superflat]]'''
* New superflat preset: "The Void".
** Spawns the player on a [[stone]] platform with a [[cobblestone]] center block, with the rest being [[air]] blocks and the void biome present everywhere.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* <code>MinecartHopper</code> entity.
** <code>Enabled</code> (byte): Determines whether or not the minecart hopper picks up items into its inventory.
*** Example: <code>/summon MinecartHopper ~ ~1 ~ {Enabled:1b}</code>.

'''Gamerules'''
* <code>spectatorsGenerateChunks</code>
** Boolean to control whether or not [[spectator]]s generate [[chunks]] on their own.
*** Defaults to true.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Farmland JE3 BE3.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Farmland]]'''
* Now has an [[inventory]] icon.

=== Items ===
[[File:Chorus Fruit JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Chorus Fruit]]'''
* Teleportation range reduced from ±32 to ±8.

[[File:Enchanted Golden Apple JE1 BE1.gif|width=32x32]] '''[[Enchanted Golden Apple|Enchanted Golden Apples]]'''
* Regeneration level has been reduced from V to II.
* Regeneration time has been reduced from 30 seconds to 20 seconds.
* Absorption level has been increased from I to IV to balance this.

[[File:Golden Apple JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Golden Apple|Golden Apples]]'''
* Regeneration level has been reduced from II to I.

[[File:Shield JE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Shield]]s'''
* Now have a new crafting recipe, requiring 6 [[planks]] and an [[iron]] ingot (this removes the need for [[wool]]).
** As a result, they now lack a base color by default: The new texture shows a wooden face.
*** Crafting a shield with a [[banner]] still yields a patterned shield.
* Arrows can now ricochet off a shield to hit other entities.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Combat'''
* [[Bow]]s can now be used when in the offhand, in the absence of a usable item in the main hand.
* [[Sword]] attack speed increased from 1.45 to 1.6.
* [[Axe]] attack speed is now based on the type, rather than 0.8 for all (similar to the [[hoe]]).
** Wooden and stone axes have as speed of 0.8.
** Iron axes have a speed of 0.9.
** Gold and diamond axes have a speed of 1.
* Certain attack damage values were changed.
** Stone and diamond axes now deal 9 damage, instead of 8 and 10 respectively.

'''[[Hardcore]]'''
* Upon death, the player now has the choice to respawn in [[Spectator]] mode, rather than the [[world]] being deleted immediately.

=== General ===
'''Performance'''
* Improved chunk generation, loading and sending.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|641980612702826496|Chunk generation & sending should be much smoother in the next snapshot, if not a tiny bit faster.|September 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|641543527713906688|I have been doing terrible things to chunk loading & sending. Best case scenario, a much smoother game. Worst case, everything ever broke.|September 9, 2015}}</ref>
** Improved rendering "by building a chunk only once where it was rebuilt up to 5 times in worst case".<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|641909240085540866|I found a way to improve rendering by building a chunk only once where it was rebuilt up to 5 times in worst case.
