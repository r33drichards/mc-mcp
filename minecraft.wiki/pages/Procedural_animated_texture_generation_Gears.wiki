Code which generates the frames of the gear texture can be found [https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/MC-TextureGen/blob/main/mc-texture-gen-impl/src/main/java/com/github/nerdthened/mctexturegen/generators/GearRotationFramesGenerator.java here].

The animation for gears was generated using two predefined image files - {{code|misc/gear.png}} for the rotating gear and {{code|misc/gearmiddle.png}} for the stationary center.

The animation, updated every game tick,<ref name="geargen">https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/MC-TextureGen/releases/tag/v1.2.0</ref> is rendered as a 16×16 texture like most other blocks. The resulting gear has 18.75 RPM.<ref name="geargen"/>

There are two different animations used for gears - one for clockwise rotation, and another for anticlockwise rotation, to allow for logical meshing. These are generated effectively identically, with the only difference being the direction of rotation; both start on the same frame, but cycle through them in the opposite direction.<ref name="geargen"/>
