Some mobs can spawn wearing [[armor]] or holding weapons, both of which may be [[enchant]]ed. In addition, some of them may also spawn with the ability to pick up armor and items that are on the ground.

== Spawning ==
=== Natural spawning ===
Adult [[zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, and [[zombie villager]]s can sometimes spawn wearing armor of any tier up to diamond and/or holding an [[iron sword]], [[iron shovel]], or [[iron spear]].
* When spawned as a [[zombie horseman]] or as part of a [[camel husk jockey]], a zombie or husk will always be holding an iron spear.

[[Drowned]] can sometimes spawn holding a [[trident]].
* Due to the mechanism with which [[zombie nautilus jockey]]s spawn, these drowned will always be holding tridents.

[[Skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], and [[parched]] always spawn holding a [[bow]] and can sometimes spawn wearing armor of any tier up to diamond.
* When spawned as a [[skeleton horseman]], a skeleton will always be wearing an enchanted [[iron helmet]], but can still spawn with other armor pieces.

Adult [[piglin]]s always spawn holding either a [[golden sword]], [[crossbow]], or [[golden spear]], and can sometimes spawn wearing golden armor.

Several mobs are guaranteed to spawn holding a weapon and cannot spawn with armor:
* [[Zombified piglin]]s always spawn holding a [[golden sword]] or [[golden spear]].
** This does not occur if spawned as a [[strider jockey]], as the golden sword or spear is overridden by a [[warped fungus on a stick]].
* [[Wither skeleton]]s always spawn holding a [[stone sword]].
** Unlike other gear mobs can spawn with, a wither skeleton's stone sword will never be enchanted.
* [[Vindicator]]s always spawn holding an [[iron axe]].
* [[Vex]]es always spawn holding an [[iron sword]].
* [[Pillager]]s always spawn holding a [[crossbow]].
* [[Piglin brute]]s always spawn holding a [[golden axe]].
* [[Illusioner]]s{{only|je|short=1}} always spawn holding a [[bow]].

===Ominous trials===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] which are spawned by [[ominous trial spawner]]s spawn with a different set of equipment than naturally spawned mobs. {{IN|je}}, equipment from mobs spawned in ominous trials is never dropped, unlike other mob equipment.

Armor always consists of a helmet and chestplate enchanted with [[Protection]] IV, [[Fire Protection]] IV, and [[Projectile Protection]] IV, with a 50% chance of each individual piece being missing. The tier and trim of the armor is randomly selected from:
* {{ItemLink|Chainmail armor}} with {{ItemLink|bolt armor trim}} in {{ItemLink|id=copper-ingot|link=Copper Ingot|copper}} (4 in 7)
* {{ItemLink|Iron armor}} with {{ItemLink|flow armor trim}} in {{ItemLink|id=copper-ingot|link=Copper Ingot|copper}} (2 in 7)
* {{ItemLink|Diamond armor}} with {{ItemLink|flow armor trim}} in {{ItemLink|id=copper-ingot|link=Copper Ingot|copper}} (1 in 7)

A melee mob's weapon is randomly selected from:
* {{ItemLink|Iron sword}} (unenchanted) (4 in 7)
* {{ItemLink|Iron sword}} ([[Sharpness]] I) (1 in 7)
* {{ItemLink|Iron sword}} ([[Knockback]] I) (1 in 7)
* {{ItemLink|Diamond sword}} (unenchanted) (1 in 7)

A ranged mob's weapon is randomly selected from:
* {{ItemLink|Bow}} (unenchanted) (2 in 4)
* {{ItemLink|Bow}} ([[Power]] I) (1 in 4)
* {{ItemLink|Bow}} ([[Punch]] I) (1 in 4)

===Zombification===
When a [[piglin]] turns into a [[zombified piglin]], its armor and weapons are retained after zombification. Zombified piglins are not capable of using [[crossbow]]s as ranged weapons, however, and will still attack with melee even if equipped with one.

=== Converting ===
When a [[husk]] converts into a [[zombie]], a [[skeleton]] converts into a [[stray]], or a [[zombie]] converts into a [[drowned]], their armor and weapons are retained after conversion.{{only|je|short=1}}<br>
The equipment is dropped when a [[husk]] converts into a [[zombie]], and when a zombie converts into a [[drowned]].{{only|be|short=1}}

===Curing===
When a [[zombie villager]] is cured, the resulting [[villager]] drops any equipped items that the zombie villager had, and cannot pick them up again.

== Picking up gear ==
The following mobs can spawn with a chance of picking up armor and weapons on Normal difficulty and higher:
* {{EntityLink|Bogged}}
* {{EntityLink|Drowned}}
* {{EntityLink|Husk}}
* {{EntityLink|Parched}}
* {{EntityLink|Skeleton}}
* {{EntityLink|Stray}}
* {{EntityLink|Wither Skeleton}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie Villager}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombified Piglin}}

Adult piglins can always pick up armor and golden weapons. They will not replace their crossbow with a golden weapon if they have one, but will replace their golden sword if they find one with better enchantments.

|}
=== Preferences ===
The systems in place for which weapons are preferred are different between {{JE}} and {{BE}}.

In both editions, [[piglin]]s prefer golden armor and weapons over other tiers.

'''Java Edition'''<br>
For weapons, the priority is as follows:
* If one weapon is preferred but the other is not, pick that weapon.
** For [[drowned]], [[trident]]s are preferred.
** For [[pillager]]s and [[piglin]]s, [[crossbow]]s are preferred.
*** Only piglins already holding a crossbow can pick one up.
** For [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], and [[parched]], [[bow]]s are preferred.
* If both or neither are preferred, pick the weapon with the higher base damage value.
* If both weapons have the same base damage value, pick the weapon with a higher quantity of enchantments.
* If both weapons have the same number of enchantments, pick the weapon that is less damaged.
* If both weapons have the same durability, pick the weapon with a custom name.
* If both or neither weapon has a custom name, keep the old weapon.

For armor, the priority is as follows:
* If one armor piece has a higher armor value, pick that armor piece.
* If both armor pieces have the same base armor value, pick the armor piece with the higher base armor toughness value.
* If both armor pieces have the same base armor toughness value, pick the armor piece with a higher quantity of enchantments.
* If both armor pieces have the same quantity of enchantments, pick the armor piece that is less damaged.
* If both armor pieces have the same durability, pick the armor piece with a custom name.
* If both or neither armor piece has a custom name, keep the old armor piece.

'''Bedrock Edition'''<br>
For weapons, the priority is as follows:
* [[Sword]]s are preferred over [[bow]]s, over [[axe]]s, over [[pickaxe]]s, over [[shovel]]s, over [[hoe]]s, over [[trident]]s, [[mace]]s, and [[crossbow]]s.
** Only mobs that can use bows or crossbows can pick them up, and only drowned are capable of using tridents as ranged weapons.
* If both weapons are of the same type, prefer the one of a higher tier.
* If both weapons are of the same type and tier, the mob will endlessly swap between them.

For armor, only the tier matters. Higher tier armor is preferred.

Mob don't pickup armor and weapons if the gamerule <code>MobGriefing</code> is off.
<references group="pm" />

== Using gear ==
=== Weapon damage ===
A [[mob]] holding a weapon adds the weapon's damage to its normal melee damage. For example, a zombie holding an iron shovel on Normal difficulty deals {{hp|3}} from its punch + {{hp|3.5}} from the shovel for a total of {{hp|6.5}}. (it should be noted that, {{in|java}}, damage values shown when hovering over weapons in the inventory include the player's {{hp|1}} base melee damage, so an iron shovel shows up as {{hp|4.5}}; subtracting 1 gives the actual weapon's damage.) The mob's weapon damage is scaled by difficulty: if a zombie would deal X damage on Normal, it deals 1.5 * X on Hard and 0.5 * X + 1 on Easy. So for example a zombie with an iron shovel deals 1.5 * 6.5 = {{hp|9.75}} on Hard and 0.5 * 6.5 + 1 = {{hp|4.25}} on Easy. Enchantments add their damage as normal before difficulty scaling.

=== Armor protection ===
{{Main|Armor}}
A [[mob]] wearing armor adds the armor's protection value to its natural armor value, if any. For example, a [[zombie]] wearing a full set of [[iron armor]] will have a total armor value of {{armor|17}} ({{armor|15}} from the iron armor + {{armor|2}} natural zombie armor). [[Armor toughness]] also applies if the mob is wearing diamond or netherite armor.

=== Other uses  ===
*Mobs that can wield [[axe]]s, such as [[vindicators]], [[piglin brute]]s, and [[zombie]]s will always disable [[shield]]s when they attack a player blocking with it.
*Mobs cannot use [[tool]]s to break blocks or for any other use, they are used solely for attacking.

=== Using enchantments ===
[[Enchantment]]s affect mobs in the same way as they do players, though mobs are incapable of benefiting from certain enchantments (i.e. [[Aqua Affinity]], [[Mending]], etc.) due to not being able to interact with the relevant mechanics.

The [[Unbreaking]] enchantment has no effect on mob armor {{in|JE}}, as mob armor does not take durability damage in that edition.

== Dropping gear ==
=== Taken equipment ===
When a mob dies, all picked-up equipment will be dropped, without changing the damage that has accumulated on it in [[Java Edition]]. In [[Bedrock Edition]], the armor's durability is still vulnerable to attacks, as if a player is wearing it.

=== Naturally-spawned equipment ===
''' Java Edition '''<br>
All mobs except [[vex]]es and [[ominous trial]] mobs have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with [[Looting III]]). <br>

''' Bedrock Edition '''<br>
All mobs except [[vex]]es have a 25% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of Looting increases the chance by 1 percentage point (28% with [[Looting III]]). <br>
Additionally, in [[Bedrock Edition]], all naturally-spawned equipment always drops (100% chance) when a [[husk]] converts into a [[zombie]] or a zombie converts into a [[drowned]], often with full durability.

=== Experience ===
Any mob that spawns with equipment gives {{xp|1|3}} extra experience points per equipment piece when killed by the player or a [[tamed wolf]].
