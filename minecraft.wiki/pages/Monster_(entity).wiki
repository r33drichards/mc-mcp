The '''monster''' entity was an unused [[hostile mob]] that looks identical to the [[player]] with the default "[[Steve]]" [[skin]].

== Spawning ==
Monsters were only spawnable using mods and map editors, but otherwise was not available in vanilla ''Minecraft''.

== Drops ==
Monsters did not [[drop]] anything when they [[die]].

== Behavior ==
Monsters shared the same AI as [[zombie]]s and would walk towards and attack the [[player]], dealing the same damage to the player as the player does with their fist. Strangely, they did not use the punching [[animation]] that a normal player would use; they would only run into the player like a [[zombie]] would.

== Trivia ==
* Monsters, when spawned, may head to the left for half a second, before turning around to attack the player. [[Zombified piglin]]s may also do this on occasion.{{verify|Does this still happen?}}
* If a monster spawner with monster is placed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.8]] or later, it appears blank and no monsters spawn.
* Coding for monsters was still present until [[Java Edition 1.8]]. Only the monster model was removed in ''Beta'' 1.8.
* It is unknown if monsters existed in [[Xbox 360 Edition]] (in versions before TU5, that were based on ''Java Edition'' Beta 1.7.3 and earlier).
* Monsters use the old [[player]] model, so they are actually slightly taller than the player.
* Despite being taller than the player, monsters looked up at the player when chasing them. This is because their actual hit-box and eye height were shorter than the player's hit-box and eye height.
* Notch also used the name "monster" for the green moboids in his unfinished game: [[Legend of the Chambered]].
