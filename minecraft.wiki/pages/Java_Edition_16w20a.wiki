'''16w20a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.10]], released on May 18, 2016,<ref name="16w20a-blog">https://web.archive.org/web/20161201000000*/http://www.mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-snapshot-16w20a/</ref> which adds [[Bone Block|bone]], [[Magma Block|magma]], and [[Nether wart block]]s; [[husk]]s and [[stray]]s as [[zombie]] and [[skeleton]] variants, respectively; [[polar bear]]s; and [[fossil]]s that spawn underground.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Bone Block (UD) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bone block]]s'''
* Crafted by filling a 3×3 square in the crafting table with [[bone meal]].
** Can be crafted back into 9 bone meal.
* Found underground in [[desert]] and [[swamp]]s as part of [[fossil]]s.

'''[[File:Magma Block JE1.gif|32px]] [[Magma block]]s'''
* Found in the [[Nether]], generating 4 blobs per chunk between Y=27 and Y=36.
** It has a similar frequency to blocks like [[andesite]] in the [[Overworld]].
* Crafted using four [[magma cream]].
* [[Mob]]s and [[player]]s take {{hp|1}} damage every second while touching it, similar to a [[cactus]].
** Unlike cactus or [[fire]], this block doesn't destroy items that touch it.
* If the player is sneaking, wearing [[Frost Walker]]–enchanted [[armor]], or under the {{EffectLink|Fire Resistance}} effect, it does not take damage.
* If the player dies by standing on it, a new death message appears: "''player'' discovered that floor was lava".
** If the player dies by the block, but after being damaged by a mob or player, the death message is: "''player'' walked into danger zone due to ''entity''".
* Removes water blocks on top when [[random tick|randomly ticked]].
* It produces smoke [[particles]] under the [[rain]].
* It emits as much [[light]] as it receives from other sources.
** e.g. A magma block next to a torch emits light at level 13, as that was the light level it received from the torch.
*** If the [[torch]] is removed, magma block searches for the next brightest source of light; if no source is found then it doesn't produce light.

'''[[File:Nether Wart Block JE1.png|32px]] [[Nether wart block]]s'''
* Crafted by filling a 3×3 square in the crafting table with [[Nether wart]].
** It cannot be crafted back into Nether wart.
* It is broken by flowing [[water]] or [[lava]], like most plants are.

'''[[File:Red Nether Bricks JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Red Nether brick]]s'''
* Crafted by placing a 2×2 checkerboard of 2 [[Nether brick]] and 2 [[Nether wart]].

'''[[File:Structure Void (item) JE1.png|32px]] [[Structure void]]s'''
* Used for the structure block to keep the blocks in that location.
** Intended to be a replacement for the function [[barrier]] blocks used to convey, so they can form part of the structure itself.
* They are invisible and have a small hitbox.
** They are only visible when using the feature in (save) structure void.
* Allows for empty spaces in a structure.
** Unlike air, it doesn't overwrite blocks where it is loaded.
** Example: If the player loads a 2-block-high structure with air at the top and a structure void at the bottom into a 2-block-high area of stone, the top block becomes air but the bottom stays stone.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Cat Spawn Egg JE1.png|32px]] [[Cat]] spawn egg

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Husk JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Husk]]s'''
* 80% of zombies spawned above ground in [[desert]] biomes, and their variants, are husks.
** All spawns where the zombie does not have a view of the sky are normal zombies or zombie villagers.
* Behaves mostly like a regular zombie. 
* Its <code>ZombieType</code> tag is 6.
* Does not burn in sunlight.
* Can spawn as a baby or as a chicken jockey.
* Applies 7 seconds of {{EffectLink|Hunger|link=Hunger (effect)}} when attacking in Easy, 14 in Normal, and 21 in Hard difficulty.
* Visually 2 pixels taller than zombies, but has the same hitbox.

'''[[File:Polar Bear JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Polar bear]]s'''
* Adults and cubs spawn randomly as passive mobs in [[ice plains]], [[ice mountains]], and [[ice plains spikes]].
* When hit, the adults attack the player, the cubs run away (very fast, similar to baby zombies).
** Additionally, adults always attack the player when their cubs are around.
* Can swim faster in water than the player.
* Cubs follow their parents.
* Drops 0–2 [[raw fish]] (75% chance) or 0–2 [[salmon]] (25% chance), each increased by 1 per level of [[Looting]].

'''[[File:Stray JE1 BE3.png|32px]] [[Stray]]'''
* 80% of skeletons spawned above ground in [[ice plains]] biomes, and their variants, are strays.
** All spawns where the skeleton does not have a view of the sky are normal skeletons.
** Spiders spawned in cold biomes have a chance of having a stray riding it.
* Acts mostly like a regular skeleton.
* Its <code>SkeletonType</code> tag is 2.
* Drops are the same as skeletons, but also have a 50% chance to drop 0-1 tipped arrow of {{EffectLink|Slowness}} when killed by the player. With Looting, chance increases to {{frac|2×level+1|2×level+2}}.
* Shoots tipped arrows of Slowness (0:30) at the target.

=== World generation ===
'''{{EnvLink|Fossil}}'''
* Generates 15–24 blocks underground in [[desert]]s, [[swampland]]s, and their variants. Each chunk has a {{frac|1|64}} chance of generating a fossil.
* Composed of [[bone block]]s and some [[coal ore]], arranged as to resemble the skulls and spines of giant extinct creatures.
** There are 4 variants of the skull, and 4 variants of the spine sections.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* {{nbt|int|ZombieType}}: Determines the kind of [[zombie]] a specific zombie is.
** 0: default, 1-5: villager, 6: [[husk]].
** This tag, in effect, unifies the characteristics of being a zombie, a specific zombie villager and a husk into a single variable.
** Intended to replace the {{nbt|byte|IsVillager}} and {{nbt|int|VillagerProfession}} tags.
*** These tags are kept for backward compatibility, but no newly generated entities have them.

'''[[Sound events]]'''
* Added <code>block.enchantment_table.use</code>.
* Added <code>entity.polar_bear.ambient</code>.
* Added <code>entity.polar_bear.baby_ambient</code>.
* Added <code>entity.polar_bear.death</code>.
* Added <code>entity.polar_bear.hurt</code>.
* Added <code>entity.polar_bear.step</code>.
* Added <code>entity.polar_bear.warning</code>.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* {{key|F3+G}} toggles the visibility of [[chunk]] borders around the player.
** Shows a blue outline for the chunk the player is currently in and a yellow outline for individual [[air]] blocks in the vicinity of the chunk.
*** The blue outline in particular, outlines the chunk horizontally on top of the solid blocks on the ground.
*** The outlines extends arbitrarily up, but ends at [[bedrock]] level.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* A new tag <code>limit</code> for the <code>looting_enchant</code> function.
** It determines the maximum amount of mob drops the player can expect to receive when using the Looting enchantment of any level.

'''[[Options]]'''
* A new 'Auto-jump' toggle has been added, which automatically makes the player jump when running towards a one block tall obstacle.
** Enabled by default, can be disabled in [[Options]].

'''[[Particle]]s'''
* A new <code>fallingdust</code> particle has been added.
** Appears underneath gravity-affected blocks that are generated or placed suspended in midair.
** Does not apply to [[dragon egg]]s.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[End stone brick]]s'''
* Are no longer craftable.

'''[[Structure block]]s'''
* Are now available in item form; can be given or summoned.
** Similarly to [[command block]]s, its placement, destruction, and modification are restricted to opped players in [[Creative]].
* Now comes with an integrated GUI and new textures.
* Has four modes:
** {{BlockSprite|Structure block save}} '''Save''' - build structure in world, tell the block where it is and it saves it to file.
** {{BlockSprite|Structure block load}} '''Load''' - loads saved structure files, replacing blocks with saved blocks except for [[structure void]] blocks.
** {{BlockSprite|Structure block corner}} '''Corner''' - for automatic size calculation.
** {{BlockSprite|Structure block data}} '''Data''' - for chest markers and other blocks that require data (default).
* Structures are limited to a size of 32 blocks in each direction.
* The coordinates used by the blocks are relative to themselves.
* When in use, it shows the outline of the structure it relates to in white.
* Can rotate and mirror structures before they are placed.
* Small red and blue cubes can be displayed in the selection area.
** Blue is for air blocks, red is for [[structure void]] blocks.
* Save and Load structure blocks can be activated by [[redstone]].
* The game protects against maps saving arbitrarily massive amounts of data to disk.
* Display a name tag above them indicating their mode and structure name.
* New tags:
** <code>powered</code>: Whether or not the structure block is currently being powered with redstone.
** <code>showboundingbox</code>: Whether or not the bounding box of the structure is being outlined.
** <code>showair</code>: Whether or not air blocks are indicated within the structure.

=== Items ===
'''[[Firework rocket]]s'''
* Recipe now produces three rockets rather than only one.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Endermen]]'''
* Can now rarely spawn in the Nether with a {{frac|1|153}} rate.
** Compared to {{frac|100|153}} for zombie pigmen.
* Can now naturally pick up [[netherrack]].

'''[[Magma cube]]s'''
* Spawn about twice as often in the Nether.
** The rate is now {{frac|2|153}}, compared to {{frac|1|151}} before.

'''[[Zombie]]s'''
* The "Zombie Generic Villager" is removed, due to the new <code>zombietype</code> tag.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* No longer turn adjacent [[sand]] blocks in the ceiling into [[sandstone]] when generating.

'''[[Ice plains]] and variants '''
* Don't spawn any other passive mobs than [[rabbit]]s and the new [[polar bear]]s anymore.
* Also have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).

'''[[Mesa]]s and variants'''
* [[Terracotta]] and the dyed forms of terracotta no longer generate more than 15 blocks deep, if the mesa is more than 15 blocks above sea level.
* In addition to the normal 2 blobs of [[gold ore]] below Y=32, attempts to generate 20 blobs between Y=32 and Y=79.
* Generate the new type of [[mineshaft]]s, described below.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* New mineshaft type that generates in mesa biomes (including all variants).
** Placed so that the midpoint of the structure is near sea level, rather than so that the top is 10 blocks or more below sea level.
** Uses dark oak wood for wooden structures.
** New tag <code>MST</code> on mineshaft structure pieces to indicate the type. 0 is the traditional mineshaft, 1 is the new mesa mineshaft.
* Features generate differently if above ground (i.e. the sky light where they generate is 8 or more). This is not dependent on mineshaft type.
** Cave spider spawners no longer generate if sky light is 8 or more.
** Various wooden pieces no longer generate if the block above is air and/or if sky light is 8 or more.
** Rails in corridors are more complete if sky light is below 8.
*** 90%, versus 70% in 1.9 and in above-ground corridors.

'''[[Plains]] and [[sunflower plains]]'''
* Now have some trees in 5% of its chunks ({{frac|1|3}} large oaks, {{frac|2|3}} normal oaks).

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Village structures are no longer restricted by [[biome]] boundaries.
** Meaning that a village that starts in a valid biome can now spread into an adjacent invalid biome.
* Now generate in taigas (but not variants).
** They are made with spruce [[log]].
* Savanna villages are now made with acacia wood instead of oak.
** In savannas, acacia logs replace cobblestone in all structures except churches.
* Paths no longer generate below sea level, and in non-desert villages they are made with different material depending on the existing terrain.
** If replacing [[grass block]]s, the path is made from [[grass path]] blocks.
** If replacing [[water]] or [[lava]], the path is made from [[planks]].
** Otherwise, the path is gravel on top of cobblestone (including bridges across ravines).
** Sandstone paths still always generate in [[desert]] villages.
* They have a 2% chance of being a zombie village, determined by <code>Zombie</code> tag in <code>Village.dat</code>.
** All generated villagers are instead [[zombie villager]]s.
** There are no [[door]]s or [[torch]]es in the village.

=== Command format ===
'''NBT format'''
* <code>NoGravity</code> now works for all [[entities]], not only [[armor stand]]s.
** A mob in midair affected by it, still responds to knockback by moving horizontally.
*** Although the AI doesn't permit any mob to move on their own, [[horse]]s and [[pig]]s ridden by the player move normally.
**** Very similarly, [[boat]]s in the [[air]] ridden by the player move as if they were in [[water]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Huge mushroom]]s<!-- This applies to all huge mushrooms including those created using bonemeal, not only to those created during world generation. Stop moving it to the "World generation" section. -->'''
* Huge mushrooms have a {{frac|1|12}} chance of generating twice as tall as normal.
** These new mushrooms, which can be up to 13 blocks tall, can appear during world generation or by being planted by the player.
