'''20w29a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16.2]], released on July 15, 2020,<ref name="20w29a">{{snap|20w29a|July 15, 2020}}</ref> which changes the syntax of spawning commands and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|spawnpoint}} and {{cmd|setworldspawn}}'''
* Added an {{cd|angle}} parameter for setting the default facing angle of a respawning [[player]].
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|spawnpoint [<targets>] [<pos>] [<angle>]}}
** {{cmd|setworldspawn [<pos>] [<angle>]}}
*** <code>angle</code>: Floating point yaw angle in degrees. Supports the relative <code>~</code> modifier, which defaults to the direction the executing player is facing.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Mobs now suffocate when their head is inside [[soul sand]], [[farmland]], and [[grass path]]s.

[[File:Vindicator JE3 BE3.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Vindicator]]s'''
* The attack animations of unarmed vindicators have been changed from [[File:Vindicator unarmed attacking JE1 BE1.png|76x76px]] to [[File:Vindicator unarmed attacking JE2.png|width=43x43]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* [[Tool]]s are now sorted based on their [[tier]].

=== General ===
'''[[Custom world generation]]'''
* <code>worldgen/noise_settings</code> can now contain noise configurations.
