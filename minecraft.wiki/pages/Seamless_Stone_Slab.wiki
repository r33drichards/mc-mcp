A '''seamless stone slab''' refers to several unused variants of the slab block with metadata exceeding what was actually used at the time. They can be considered a precursor to [[smooth stone]].

== Obtaining ==
Seamless slabs were never intended to be obtainable by any means, and as such inventory editors are generally the most reliable method of obtaining them.

There exist methods of block transmutation that may be used to obtain seamless stone slabs, allowing them to exist in block form, and then be broken to collect them in item form.

Due to their nature of being extreme data values, and the fact that all of these data values eventually became used in-game, worlds containing the slabs that eventually used said values can be downgraded to obtain seamless slabs in an earlier version. This is, however, risky, and can cause crashes and world corruption.

=== Breaking ===

Seamless stone slabs require a [[pickaxe]] to mine, dropping themselves when broken.

== Usage ==
Seamless stone slabs can be used for any of the things other stone-type slabs can be used for, aside from being a crafting ingredient. They can be placed in the exact same way other slabs can.

=== Model ===
The seamless stone slab can be visually distinguished from normal smooth stone slabs via the texture they use: while smooth stone slabs have a dedicated side texture as to make single slabs appear polished, and double slabs appear to be composed of two single slabs, the seamless stone slab's side texture appears cut off in single form, and in double form identical to smooth stone. Indeed, the seamless stone double slab was itself a precursor to smooth stone, which would end up being implemented intentionally.

The use of a single texture on all sides is a trend that can be seen in many other extreme metadata variants: [[wood]], which also eventually became obtainable intentionally, [[piston]]s and [[sticky piston]]s, [[hay bale]]s, and Bedrock Edition-exclusive cases of [[chiseled quartz block]]s, [[quartz pillar]]s, [[purpur pillar]]s and [[bone block]]s. (Several other extraneous metadata variants, such as those of lit and unlit [[furnace]]s, [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, [[jack o'lantern]]s and [[pumpkin]]s, the last of which also was reimplemented intentionally, used their texture on four sides, due to having a dedicated top and bottom and most being able to face in four directions.)

=== Conversion ===
As the seamless stone slab is, by definition, an extreme metadata value of the smooth stone slab, and metadata was used to distinguish different slab types, seamless stone slabs would end up transforming into these slab variants as a world is updated.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3|[[File:Seamless Stone Slab JE1.png|32px]] Added seamless stone single slabs, which visually differ from regular smooth stone slabs by using the top texture on the sides. They existed as numerical metadata values of the usual slab block, with values 4 to 15. All twelve of these appeared identical, but would not stack, and would not create double slabs with a seamless stone slab of another data value.
|Their addition was not intentional, as only metadata values 0 to 3 were used for intended slab types, with the behavior of values above this being ignored by developers at this time.
|No name was defined for these items; hovering the cursor over these would crash the game.
|Prior to this version, stone slab blocks could be given metadata above 0, but would just look like normal smooth stone slabs.{{verify}}}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7|[[File:Seamless Stone Slab JE2.png|32px]] The texture application of the single slab has changed to use the bottom half of the texture, like with all slabs and many other blocks after this update.}}

|{{HistoryLine||1.2.1|dev=1.2|[[File:Seamless Stone Slab Top JE1 BE1.png|32px]] Seamless stone slabs can now be placed on the top half of blocks.
|As a result of the implementation of top slabs, seamless stone slabs with data values 8-13 have been replaced with the upper versions of the normally obtainable slabs 0-5, and 14-15 have been replaced by the top versions of seamless stone slabs 6-7.
|This also means that the item forms of smooth stone slabs with metadata 8 through 15 can no longer be obtained via mining the respective blocks. Refer to [[Invalid Data Value Stone Slab]] for more information on these items.}}

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w04a|"Smooth stone" has been reimplemented as the double stone slab with metadata value 8, by having double slabs 8 and above use the top texture on all six sides. There is still no single variant.}}
