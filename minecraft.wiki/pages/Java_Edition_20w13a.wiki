== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Lodestone JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Lodestone]]'''
* Crafted from a [[netherite ingot]] and [[chiseled stone brick]]s.
* {{control|Using}} a [[compass]] on one creates a lodestone compass, which points to that lodestone block.
* Its functionality applies in all dimensions.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Warped Fungus on a Stick JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Warped fungus on a stick]]'''
* Crafted with a [[fishing rod]] and [[warped fungus]].
* Can be used to control [[strider]]s in the same way as a [[carrot on a stick]] with [[pig]]s.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Strider Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Strider spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Strider JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Strider]]'''
* A new passive mob that spawns in [[the Nether]] on lava oceans.
* Can be saddled and controlled with [[warped fungus on a stick]].
* Is damaged by [[water]] and [[rain]].
* Can be bred with [[warped fungi]].
* Can spawn with [[zombified piglin]]s or baby striders riding them.
** If they spawn with a zombified piglin, they also have a saddle equipped.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the {{cd|logs_that_burn}} block and item tags.
** Contains the {{cd|dark_oak_logs|oak_logs|acacia_logs|birch_logs|jungle_logs|spruce_logs|d=and}} block and item tags, respectively.
* Added the {{cd|non_flammable_wood}} block and item tags.
** Contains crimson and warped stems, hyphae, planks, and other wood blocks, as well as stripped variants where applicable.
** Items in the item tag cannot be used as fuel in a furnace.
* Added the {{cd|strider_warm_blocks}} block tag.
** Contains [[lava]].
** Unless a strider is in a block in this tag, it shivers.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Basalt]]'''
* Can now be made if lava touches [[blue ice]] while flowing over [[soul soil]].

'''[[Bee nest]]s'''
* Now appear yellow on maps.

'''[[Campfire]]s'''
* Can now be crafted with [[log|stem]]s and [[hyphae]].

'''[[Fence]]s'''
* Nether wood fences now connect to other wood fences.

'''[[Hyphae]] and [[log|stem]]s'''
* Now use the nether wood material.
** Can no longer catch fire from lava.

'''[[Jigsaw block]]'''
* Can have one of 12 orientations.
* Added new property {{cd|Joint type}} to describe if attached piece can be rotated ({{cd|rollable}}) or not ({{cd|aligned}}).
* NBT field {{cd|target_pool}} has been renamed to {{cd|pool}}.
* {{cd|attachement_type}} has been split into {{cd|name}} (on parent block) and {{cd|target}} (on child block).

'''[[Nether gold ore]]'''
* The texture has been changed.
* Now drops [[experience]] when [[breaking|mined]].

'''Nether [[planks]], [[stairs]], [[slab]]s, [[door]]s, [[button]]s, [[trapdoor]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, and [[sign]]s'''
* Can no longer be used as fuel in furnaces, blast furnaces, or smokers.

'''[[Note block]]'''

'''[[Polished basalt]]'''

'''[[Smoker]]'''
* Can now be crafted with [[log|stem]]s and [[hyphae]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Charcoal]]'''
* Can now only be smelted from items in the {{cd|logs_that_burn}} block tag.
** This change doesn't affect gameplay, as the new tag only contains items charcoal could be smelted from.

'''[[Compass]]'''
* Now points to the center of the spawn point block instead of its northwest corner.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Farmers can now use bone meal to make their crops grow faster.
* Farmers now put excess seeds in their composter.
* Farmers share excess wheat with other farmers, so more farmers can make bread.

'''[[Zombified piglin]]s'''
* Texture has been tweaked.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Breeding striders can now be used to unlock "The Parrots and the Bats" advancement.

'''[[Bartering]]'''
* Items enchanted with [[Soul Speed]] are now slightly more common.

'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Moved [[bamboo]], [[kelp]], and [[sugar cane]] to the "Decoration Blocks" tab.

'''[[Fishing]]'''
* Open water is now calculated differently. Each layer in the 5&times;4&times;5 area around the bobber must meet one and only one of the following criteria:
** Have only water source blocks, waterlogged blocks without collision, or [[bubble column]]s.
** Have only air or [[lily pad]]s.

'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* Charcoal now unlocks using the {{cd|logs_that_burn}} item tag.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the [[respawn anchor]] to the {{cd|dragon_immune}} block tag.
* Changed the {{cd|logs}} block and item tags to use the {{cd|logs_that_burn|crimson_stems|warped_stems|d=and}} block and item tags, respectively.
