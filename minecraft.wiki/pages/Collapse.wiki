The '''Collapse''' was an incident involving a seismic sinkhole swallowing an entire village and killing miners, preceding the events of [[Caves & Cliffs Explorers]].

== Background ==
On a rainy night, an engineer was working in the white workshop in their village. They got unhappy when they noticed that the seismograph in their workshop began showing signs of an incoming earthquake by going off: the main cause of the Collapse.

According to the Caves & Cliffs Explorers article, the Collapse was also caused by overmining, which made the ground too weak and collapsed the village to the mines.

== Biography ==
In the mine underneath the village, miners were working as usual, until one of them stopped a [[minecart with chest]] on a wooden bridge across the ravine. The ground began to shake and the miner lost their balance, hanging to the bridge as the minecart fell to the lava. The other miners crawled between the ravine and the mine's walls, seeking a path for evacuation. The miner hanging from the bridge fell into the ravine during the evacuation.

Back on the surface, the same earthquake caused pieces of land to suddenly lower, starting the Collapse. The engineer and other villagers came out of their workshops in panic while an [[iron golem]] tried rescuing two villagers (a [[shepherd]] and a [[farmer]]), stopping on its way as a large fissure opened up. In the mines, the miners tried fleeing as pieces of land started to fall down. Meanwhile, the iron golem, threatened, accidentally threw the villagers into the sinkhole and fell over as the piece of ground it was standing on fell right onto a miner.

== Aftermath ==
As the day came and the earthquake stopped, [[Alex]] and [[Steve]] came out of the mine and out of a cave where most of the village, now covered with dirt, was swallowed by the Collapse that occured that night, with the Mayor watching the ruins. After the player finished all their quests in the map, the village started repairing slowly to fix the destruction caused by the Collapse.
