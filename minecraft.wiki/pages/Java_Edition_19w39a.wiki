'''19w39a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.15]], released on September 27, 2019,<ref name="19w39a">{{snap|19w39a|September 27, 2019}}</ref> which fixes many bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* The [[block]] selection outline was reverted to how it looked before [[19w38a]].

'''[[Iron door]]s'''
* Must now be {{ctrl|mined}} with a [[pickaxe]] for it to be dropped as an [[item]].

'''[[Melon stem]]s and [[pumpkin stem]]s'''
* Attached stems now drop their seeds again when broken.

'''[[Rail]]s'''
* Now places facing the [[player]], rather than always north-south.

=== Command format ===
'''[[JSON text|NBT text components]]'''
* Added NBT text component variant for NBT storage: <code>{"nbt": <''path''>, "storage":"<''resource id''>"}</code>.

=== General ===
'''[[Block model]]s'''
* Lighting of blocks in the inventory has been swapped from being dark on the right to being dark on the left.

'''[[Texture]]s'''
* Changed texture map for all [[chest]]s.
* Banner patterns now use the alpha channel instead of brightness.{{verify|MC-161909 implies it happened in 19w38b and was only announced in this version's blog post}}
* The [[ender dragon]] no longer has a separate texture for the bottom of its wing anymore.
* The glint texture for [[enchant]]ed items now appears like it does in-game.
