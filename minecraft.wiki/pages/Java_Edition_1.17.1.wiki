'''1.17.1''' is a minor update to {{JE}}, released on July 6, 2021, which changes some game mechanics and fixes bugs and crashes.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-17-1|Minecraft Java Edition 1.17.1|July 6, 2021}}</ref> It is not compatible with [[Java Edition 1.17|1.17]] servers. It is the last version to require Java 16.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Two previously untranslated death messages for some underwater mobs have been given messages:
** <code><Name> died from dehydration</code>.
** <code><Name> died from dehydration whilst trying to escape <Name></code>.

'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added Classical Chinese.<ref group=note>Also available for versions since [[19w34a]].</ref>

'''Enchanting'''
* All enchantments are now capped at level 255 in both display and power.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Cauldron JE8.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Cauldron]]s'''
* [[Powder snow]] now fills cauldrons twice as fast as before.

=== Items ===
[[File:Spyglass (item) JE3 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Spyglass]]'''
* Tweaked held model texture to include glass on the backside.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Blue Axolotl JE2.gif|width=48x48]] '''[[Axolotl]]'''
* Blue axolotls now only spawn through [[breeding]].

[[File:Drowned JE1.png|width=50x50]] '''[[Drowned]]'''
* Increased the drop probability of a [[copper ingot]] from 5% to 11%, and increased the drop rate with each level of [[Looting]] from 1% to 2%.
** This change is to match {{edition|bedrock}}'s drop rates.

[[File:Goat JE1 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Goat]]s'''
* Breeding common goats now have a 2% chance to produce screaming goats.
* Status effects applied to goats now also apply when the goat is jumping or ramming.

{{Animate|Zombie JE3 BE2.png;Plains Zombie Villager Base JE1 BE1.png;Husk JE2 BE2.png;Drowned JE1.png|32px}} '''[[Zombie]]s, [[Zombie Villager|Zombie Villagers]], [[Husk]]s and [[Drowned]]'''
* No longer pick up [[glow ink sac]]s.
** This prevents zombies from persisting after picking up the loot of a dead [[glow squid]].

=== General ===
'''[[Protocol]]'''
* Handshake packet padding method for "hostname" and "port" field has reverted to pre-1.17 when the server address which used is a SRV record.
** Now, data padded in these field uses the address and port which SRV record pointed at, instead of using "server address" as "hostname" and 25565 as "port".

'''[[Font]]s'''
* Some new characters have been added.
** Includes several currency symbols and some new emoji.
** The new characters are: <span style="word-break:break-all;">✂🍖🪣🔔⏳⚑₠₡₢₣₤₥₦₩₫₭₮₰₱₲₳₵₶₷₸₹₺₻₼₿</span>

'''[[Language]]s'''

** East Allgovian German<ref group=note>Also removed from 1.15's assets.</ref>
** Manx
** Sicilian<ref group=note>Also removed from 1.15's and 1.16's assets.</ref>
