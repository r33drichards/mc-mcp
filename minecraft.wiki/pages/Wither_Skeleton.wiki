A '''wither skeleton''' is a tall, black variant of a [[skeleton]] equipped with a [[stone sword]]. They inflict the [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect when attacking the [[player]]. They are found exclusively in [[Nether fortress]]es and are the only source of [[wither skeleton skull]]s, as well as the only [[renewable]] source of [[coal]].

== Spawning ==
Wither skeletons can spawn in [[Nether fortress]]es at a [[light#Light level|light level]] between 0 and 7, in [[Pack spawning|groups]] of 5{{Only|Java|short=JE}} or 2-3{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}:

* In the structure bounding box of any single piece of the Nether fortress they can spawn on any block
* In the larger area bounding box of the entire Nether fortress they can spawn exclusively on [[Nether bricks]]

They are the only mobs that can spawn inside [[wither rose]]s due to their immunity to the damaging effect.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Spider jockeys ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}[[Spider]]s and [[cave spider]]s spawned in the Nether using commands or [[spawn egg]]s have a 1% chance to spawn as a [[spider jockey]], with an 80% chance of that spider being ridden by a wither skeleton.

=== Halloween ===
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
On Halloween, wither skeletons have a 22.5% chance of spawning wearing a [[carved pumpkin]] and a 2.5% chance of spawning wearing a [[Jack o'lantern]]. They are never dropped.

=== Withers ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
The [[wither]] spawns 3-4 wither skeletons when below half health on Normal and Hard [[difficulties]].

== Drops ==

}}
* 8.5% chance of dropping their unenchanted stone [[sword]] which has a random [[durability]]. This chance increases by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5% chance with Looting III.
* {{xp|5}} experience orbs when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]], and an additional {{xp|1|3}} is dropped per piece of naturally-spawned equipment that ''does not'' drop upon death.
** Because all wither skeletons spawn with a stone sword, each of them effectively drop {{xp|6|8}} if the sword is not dropped.
** If the wither skeleton ''does'' drop its stone sword, it drops the default {{xp|5}} instead.
* A [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]] worn by a wither skeleton spawned on Halloween is never dropped.

== Behavior ==
Wither skeletons wander aimlessly when idle. They [[sprint]] to attack [[player]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[Turtle#Predators|baby turtles]], [[piglin]]s, and [[piglin brute]]s within 16 blocks.

When an [[entity]] is attacked by a wither skeleton on any [[difficulty]], it is inflicted with the [[Wither (effect)|Wither effect]] for 10 seconds, which turns the [[health]] bar black ({{hp|20|notag=1|withered=1}}) and decreases it by {{hp|1|withered=1}} every two seconds. Unlike [[Poison]], this effect can cause death.

[[Wolves]] are aggressive toward wither skeletons, which retaliate when attacked. Wither skeletons flee from wolves {{in|java}}, but do not {{in|bedrock}} because they are part of the skeleton [[family]] and wolves attack any mob from that family.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-173569||Wither Skeletons do not flee from Wolves}}</ref> Despite being associated to iron golems, [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s are ignored by wither skeletons. However, a wither skeleton can retaliate if a [[firework rocket]] set by a villager hits it.

In Normal and Hard difficulties, some wither skeletons pick up dropped equipment. The chance depends on [[regional difficulty]], with up to 55% of them capable of picking up [[sword]]s higher than stone [[tiers|tier]] plus any [[armor]]. Wither skeletons never take {{ItemLink|bow}}s; {{in|Java}}, if they hold a bow (which can be done with {{cmd|/summon wither_skeleton ~ ~ ~ {equipment:{mainhand:{id:bow, count:1<nowiki>}}}</nowiki>}}) they shoot flaming [[arrow]]s even if their bows are not enchanted, dealing the same damage as a normal skeleton would plus an additional {{hp|4}} of fire damage. If the wither skeleton is holding a [[tipped arrow]] or [[spectral arrow]] in its off-hand, it shoots that type of arrow, and the arrow held is not consumed. They cannot use [[crossbow]]s.

Wither skeletons are immune to [[fire]] and the Wither effect. They still seek shade or [[water]] during daylight if they are in the [[Overworld]], even though they do not burn in [[sun]]light.

As they are also under the "skeletons" [[entity type tag]], if a wither skeleton (only possible through commands) kills a [[creeper]], the creeper drops a [[music disc]], randomly selected from [[13]], [[Music Disc cat|cat]], [[Music Disc blocks|blocks]], [[chirp]], [[far]], [[mall]], [[mellohi]], [[stal]], [[strad]], [[ward]], [[11]], and [[wait]].{{only|java}}

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* ignored by the [[wither]].
* affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* a threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Due to their height of 2.4 blocks, they cannot fit through openings 2 blocks tall.
