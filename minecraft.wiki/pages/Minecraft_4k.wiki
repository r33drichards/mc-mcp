'''''Minecraft 4k''''' was an edition of ''[[Minecraft]]'' developed for the 2010 {{w|Java 4K Game Programming Contest|Java 4K}} contest, where the entry games were required to be within four {{w|Byte#Multiple-byte units|kibibytes}} (4096 bytes) in size.<ref name="forum"> {{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150809054725/http://www.java-gaming.org/index.php?topic=21638.0|title=Minecraft 4k (very early build)|website=Java-Gaming.org|author=Markus_Persson|date=December 3, 2009}}</ref>

The initial version, released on December 2, 2009, was more limited than any other edition of ''Minecraft'' ever released to the public, including the pre-classic version that is available from the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''. An update on December 4, 2009, changed the controls and added widescreen, more [[block]]s, and the ability to place and destroy blocks.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514175231/http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/minecraft-4k-very-early-build/21638/msg/177585/view.html|title=Minecraft 4k (very early build)|website=Java-Gaming.org|author=Markus_Persson|date=December 3, 2009|quote=Widescreen! Many block types! Building and destroying blocks! Different mouse look that frees up both buttons! Less bugs!
Also, the .pack.gz is STILL under 2kb :P}}</ref>

The [https://www.mojang.com/notch/j4k/minecraft4k/ original page] hosting the game was removed in November 2014. Its archive can still be accessed using the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141101124251/https://www.mojang.com/notch/j4k/minecraft4k/ Wayback Machine]. The executable is also available on the [https://files.betacraft.uk/launcher/assets/versions/4k-2.jar BetaCraft website].

On December 2, 2012, Notch released [http://jsfiddle.net/uzMPU a JavaScript version of ''Minecraft 4k'']. It is not possible to move or look around in this version, though the camera  or world does move by itself, and there is a [[/Water|blue water-like block]] in addition to the other block types.<ref>{{tweet|notch|275331530040160256|Trying http://jsfiddle.net: http://jsfiddle.net/uzMPU/|December 2, 2012}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
=== General===
The [[player]] can place and destroy [[block]]s. The only block the player can place is [[/Grass Block|grass]], reminiscent of the very early builds of ''Minecraft'' internally called [[RubyDung]] that are available from the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''. [[/Leaves|Leaves]] do not decay.

=== World ===
The same 64×64×63 [[block]] world is generated every time the game is loaded. The only blocks in the game – [[#Blocks|air]], [[/Grass Block|grass]], [[/Dirt|dirt]], [[/Stone|stone]], [[/Bricks|bricks]], [[/Log|log]], and [[/Leaves|leaves]] – are scattered throughout the world. No [[mob]]s exist.

The initial build of the game only has one type of block, which uses a XOR fractal as a texture.

An invisible wall surrounds the world, preventing the [[player]] from escaping, similar to [[invisible bedrock]] or an [[old]] world.

=== Controls ===
The [[player]] can move around using standard {{Key|W|A|S|D}} controls, as well as jump using {{Key|Space}}.

Left- and right-clicking controls are different from traditional ''Minecraft'' controls: right-click doesn't place [[block]]s, and left-click doesn't destroy them. Instead, the opposite is true (with the addition of a middle-click control that also places blocks).

The camera in Minecraft 4K also acts differently from any other ''Minecraft'' edition. The camera only moves when the player moves the cursor a considerably large distance away from the center of the game's {{w|viewport}}, with a motion similar to that of the cinematic camera {{in|je}}. It is also worth mentioning that camera view and FOV cannot be changed in this edition. Blocks in the world are selected by the cursor, rather than the center of the viewport.

The game lacks any sort of options menu or HUD.

== Graphics ==
The graphics appear pixelated as a result of the game rendering at a low resolution. Even when running at a higher resolution, the game does not scale the resolution properly and the noisy appearance is retained. [[Block]] textures are similar to those used in [[Java Edition Classic]], as [[Classic 0.30 (Creative)]] was the most recent version of ''Minecraft'' at the time. Most blocks appear noisier than their ''Minecraft'' counterparts, although some blocks, especially stone, are very different. The [[sky]] is black due to the lack of a skybox.

When hovering the cursor over a block, the outline of the block is thick and white, as opposed to ''Minecraft'''s thin gray selection outline.

== Blocks ==
The first version of the game has a single non-air block.

In the second version, block IDs are stored with four bits, resulting in 16 possible IDs. The majority of these (10) are filled in by slightly differently textured dirt.

The [[4k-JavaScript|JavaScript]] version stores block IDs in the same way as the second version. Nearly all blocks from the previous version are available, except for one variant of dirt, which has been replaced by a blue, water-like block exclusive to this version.
