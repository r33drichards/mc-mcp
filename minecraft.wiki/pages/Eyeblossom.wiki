An '''eyeblossom''' is a unique [[flower]] found in the [[pale garden]] biome. It changes state depending on the [[daylight cycle]], closing during the day and opening at night. Its "eye", visible only when the flower is open, glows in the dark but does not emit light in its surroundings.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
An eyeblossom can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself in its current state.

An eyeblossom also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

{{breaking row|Eyeblossom|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Eyeblossoms generate naturally on [[grass block]]s or [[pale moss block]]s in the [[pale garden]] biome.
{{Block distribution}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell an open eyeblossom for 1 [[emerald]]. Wandering traders do not sell closed eyeblossoms.
{{Trade sources|Open Eyeblossom|Closed Eyeblossom}}

=== Post-generation ===
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a pale garden biome, eyeblossoms have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area {{in|Java}}, or a 7×5×7 area {{in|Bedrock}}. {{IN|java}}, eyeblossoms generate closed or open depending on the time of day, while {{in|bedrock}} they always generate closed, even during the night.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, when [[bone meal]] is applied to an eyeblossom in any biome, more eyeblossoms appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square. These eyeblossoms are either open or closed depending on the state of the original eyeblossom.

== Usage ==
Like other flowers, eyeblossoms can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[pale moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Eyeblossoms can be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

The eye section remains at maximum brightness regardless of the surrounding light level. This affects placed and potted open eyeblossoms, however the item form of open eyeblossoms still appears at the surrounding brightness level.<ref>{{bug|MC-277937}}</ref>

=== Opening and closing ===
[[File:Eyeblossoms opening.gif|thumb|right|A field of eyeblossoms opening at night]]
Eyeblossoms close during the day and open at night, emitting particles when they do so. Eyeblossoms communicate with other nearby eyeblossoms, telling them to open or close. Eyeblossoms never change their state when placed in [[the Nether]] or [[the End]].

When an eyeblossom receives a [[tick#Random tick|random tick]], it checks if it has the correct state for the time of day. If the eyeblossom should change states from open to closed, or closed to open, it does so and checks for other eyeblossoms within a 7&times;5&times;7 block area centered on the eyeblossom (i.e. 3 blocks horizontally, and 2 blocks vertically). If other eyeblossoms are found, they receive a [[Tick#Scheduled tick|scheduled tick]] to perform the same process of checking their state and looking for nearby eyeblossoms.

Potted eyeblossoms can change state, but do so only upon receiving a random tick; they cannot communicate with other eyeblossoms, whether potted or not.

Eyeblossoms are detected by [[observer]]s and [[sculk sensor]]s when they open or close.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage|Closed Eyeblossom, Open Eyeblossom}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using an open eyeblossom imparts the {{EffectLink|Blindness}} effect for 11 seconds {{in|java}} or 7 seconds {{in|bedrock}}. Suspicious stew created with a closed eyeblossom imparts the {{EffectLink|Nausea}} effect for 7 seconds. Suspicious stew can be crafted using an eyeblossom or produced by feeding an eyeblossom to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
When a [[bee]] touches an open eyeblossom on any [[difficulty]] other than Peaceful, it is inflicted with the [[Poison]] effect for {{convert|1.25|second|game tick}}. Despite this, bees can still pollinate open eyeblossoms as they do with other flowers.

Open eyeblossoms can be used to lead bees, but cannot be used to breed them or grow baby bees. Feeding a bee an open eyeblossom inflicts it with the [[Poison]] effect for {{convert|1.25|second|game tick}}, without angering the bee.

Bees do not interact with closed eyeblossoms. They are not attracted by closed eyeblossoms, do not get poisoned if they touch one, and cannot be fed one.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s planted within 2 blocks of an eyeblossom have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing an eyeblossom into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Ambient sounds ===
An open eyeblossom emits subtle [[#Unique|eerie sounds]] when it is planted on a [[pale moss block]].
