A '''bucket of cod''', internally known as '''cod bucket''', is a living [[cod]] inside of a [[water bucket]].

== Obtaining ==
A bucket of cod can be obtained by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on a [[cod]]. Once a water bucket is used, the cod is picked up along with the water source block.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Pressing {{control|use}} with a bucket of cod places a [[water]] source block, and spawns the cod back into the world, leaving an [[bucket|empty bucket]] in the [[player]]'s [[inventory]]. Placing a bucket of cod in [[the Nether]] causes the same [[particle]]s to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the cod is spawned alone.

Cod caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.

If a bucket of cod is inside a [[dispenser]], the dispenser spawns the cod and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up a cod when using a water bucket, due to the bucket being emptied instead.

If a bucket of cod is named a certain name through an [[anvil]], the cod inside displays that name as if it were named with a [[Name Tag|name tag]].{{Only|java}} Alternatively, if a named cod is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of cod shares a name with the captured cod.{{Only|java}} If a named cod is captured {{in|Bedrock}}, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".
