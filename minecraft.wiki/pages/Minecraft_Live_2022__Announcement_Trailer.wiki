'''Minecraft Live 2022: Announcement Trailer''' is the announcement trailer for [[Minecraft Live 2022]] and the most popular announcement trailer for Minecraft Live with 16 million views.

== Summary ==
The video opens on the visual of a [[tadpole]] swimming into the camera's direction, seemingly greeting the viewer before hundreds of tadpoles form a school in the shape of the ''Minecraft Live'' logo. A temperate [[frog]] swims into view, before leaping up into a [[lush cave]] and marching out into a [[savanna]], with two other frogs, while many mobs bob their head. The frogs then appear briefly in a [[grove]], with the cold frog eating a [[goat]] whole. The frogs then appear in a [[swamp]], with a fourth frog attempting to eat a small [[slime]], which is then saved by an [[allay]]. The fourth frog is very agitated by this.

Chasing after the allay through a [[mountain]], it leaps near a sign labeled "it is [[snapshot]] day, my dudes" and lands on top of a goat. Agitating it in return. The allay, the fourth frog, and the goat run by a [[zombie]], the latter almost running it over. The zombie is also very agitated by this. They all run through a [[birch forest]], as text appears in the sky explaining that the show broadcasted live, as many farm animals also become agitated. The frog appears suddenly in [[the Nether]], where it chews up a [[magma cube]] and spits out a [[froglight]], agitating another magma cube beside it.

The three initial frogs reappear, now in a [[desert]], with the agitated mobs chasing after each other in the background. They then appear in a [[jungle]] and then the border between a [[crimson forest]] and [[soul sand valley]], with the agitated mobs continuing to appear in the distance. They then appear in a [[mineshaft]], with the release date being given and monsters joining the dancing. Suddenly, the {{MCD|Arch-Illager}} appears, and to his horror the {{MCD|Orb of Dominance}} is eaten by a frog. He tries to chase after the frog, but is stampeded by established mobs. The frogs then appear in a village.

As the frogs emerge in a [[mushroom field]], the [[Mob Vote]] is announced. They then appear rapidly between a [[stronghold]], the [[ocean]], a [[woodland mansion]], and then [[the End]], the mobs continuing to run in the background. Finally, the allay flies into the [[deep dark]], where the fourth frog trips and accidentally sets off a staggering amount of [[sculk sensors]], summoning the [[Warden]], who appears from underneath the Arch-Illager. The frogs proceed to march on normally, while everyone else flees the agitated Warden as it destroys text confirming news on update. The scene transitions to a {{MCL|mace runt}} attacking several {{MCL|villager}}s, before being caught off guard by the stampede of agitated mobs, causing the mace runt to also become agitated. The frog trio continue marching on, now in a {{MCL|village}} from {{MCL}}.

The allay then flies by Alex in a mangrove swamp, who is placing a [[Sign|mangrove sign]], which the allay knocks them into. Overwhelmed by the massive amount of mobs chasing after the slime, the allay hands it over to them, before revealing the sign was for the train to ''Minecraft Live''. This somehow calms everyone down, as they begin dancing once again and get on the train.
