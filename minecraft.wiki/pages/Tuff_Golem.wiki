The '''tuff golem''' was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2022 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[Minecraft Live 2022]], alongside the [[sniffer]] and [[rascal]].<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2022-tuff-golem|Mob Vote 2022: Tuff Golem|October 5, 2023|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> It was a golem that would have been built by the player. If a [[wool]] block was included while building it, the tuff golem would have worn a cloak matching the color of the wool. 

The tuff golem was a statue that would have held and displayed any [[item]] and, when awoken, would have moved around while holding the item or picked up an item if it was not holding one. The tuff golem would have returned back to the spot that it woke up from before turning back into a statue. The tuff golem would have been one block tall so players could stack them.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-live-2022-the-details|MINECRAFT LIVE 2022: THE DETAILS|October 13, 2023|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

The tuff golem lost the vote with only 17.2% of the votes.
