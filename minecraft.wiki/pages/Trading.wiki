'''Trading''' is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows [[player]]s to exchange [[emerald]]s for [[item]]s, and vice versa, with [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s.

== Mechanics ==
Pressing {{control|use}} on an adult [[villager]] with a profession, or on a [[wandering trader]], opens a menu, allowing a player to trade with that merchant. This action pauses any pathfinding the merchant was doing and makes it face you. If the merchant takes [[damage]] while trading, the trading menu closes. The same thing happens if they walk or are transported far enough away.

All transactions involve [[emerald]]s. Trading is the only method of acquiring the [[globe banner pattern]], [[arrows of Decay]]{{only|BE|short=1}}, as well as all types of [[explorer map]]s except [[buried treasure]] maps in [[Survival]] mode. It is also the only [[renewable]] way to obtain [[bell]]s, [[diamond]] gear <ref group="note">Technically, diamond armor (not other types of diamond gear) can also be obtained renewably from zombies and skeletons; however, these mobs only have a 0.04% ({{frac|1|25,000}}) chance to spawn with diamond armor, rendering this an extremely impractical way to obtain such armor.</ref>, [[lapis lazuli]]{{only|BE|short=1}}, [[bottles o' enchanting]], [[glass]], [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[coral block]]s, and [[small dripleaves]].

=== Level ===
Villagers have five career levels that can be increased by trading with them. Each villager starts at the novice level. A villager's level can be seen in the trading menu. The badge that a villager wears can also be identified: stone for a novice, iron for an apprentice, gold for a journeyman, emerald for an expert, and diamond for a master. Trading until the villager's trading bar gets full unlocks the next level of trades. When a player trades with a villager, both the villager and the player gain [[experience]]. All villager trades reward the player with 3–6 [[experience]] plus an additional 5 experience if the villager levels up with the trade. Trading with a wandering trader also rewards the player with some experience, although the trader does not have experience levels to gain. A villager levels up when its experience bar becomes full and gains up to two{{only|je|short=1}} or three{{only|be|short=1}} new trades and retains its existing trades. Additionally, a villager receives a [[Regeneration]] effect and becomes surrounded by purple particles for ten seconds.

Trades from the master level would still reward the villager with experience, but it has no actual effect as the villager can't level up any further.

Each badge is 2x3 pixels except the novice (stone) badge, which is 4x4 pixels.

{{IN|java}}, villagers have a maximum of 10 trades. Each level unlocks a maximum of two new trades. If a level has a pool of more than two trades, the two offered trades are chosen randomly from the set.

{{IN|bedrock}}, villagers have 7–10 trade slots. A slot with multiple possible trades will display only one trade; for example, farmer villagers have 4 potential trades in their first trade slot, so each trade has a {{frac|1|4}} chance to be chosen.{{until|Villager Trade Rebalancing}}{{verify}}

A villager's [[profession]] dictates the trading pool used to determine its trades. For example, villagers wearing straw hats are farmers, so their trades are based on the Farmer trade pool. Each profession unlocks a predefined and finite set of offers. Different professions are assigned to each villager based on their job-site block. This profession is indicated by their appearance and in the trading interface. Novice villagers who have not traded can lose their profession and change back into unemployed villagers if their claimed job site block is removed. Removing and then replacing a job site block can alter the trades offered, and a villager with no experience resets its trades every so often. Once a player trades with a villager, the villager keeps its profession forever and subsequently locks in the offered trades.

=== Trades ===
Each trade can be used a maximum number of times, after which the villager runs out of stock, and the trade becomes disabled. The exact number is different for each item and referenced in the tables below. When villagers work at their [[job site block]]s, they activate their offers again, up to twice per day. {{IN|bedrock}}, villagers need to be linked to a bed to restock their trades (it is not necessary for them to sleep, but they require a bed nearby). When an offer is disabled, a red "X" appears in the trading interface {{in|java}}, or the trading slot becomes red {{in|bedrock}}, and the villager displays the same particle effect as an offer being created.

When buying items from players, villagers ignore [[Data component format|additional item data]]; this allows, for example, selling renamed or enchanted items, as well as [[lodestone compass]]es instead of regular [[compass]]es {{in|java}}. When the [[Villager Trade Rebalance]] experiment is enabled, taiga armorers can also accept armor of any durability.<!--including 0 & negative durability-->

=== Sale prices ===
{{Anchor|Economics}}
{{Hatnote|For the default sale price of a specific trade, find the trade in the tables below.}}
{{Redirect|Discount|the mechanic that influences trading prices and iron golem hostility|Gossiping}}

All price fluctuations affect only the first item involved in trade; for example, for an initial trade of 32 sticks for 1 emerald, the price might be driven down to 1 stick or up to 64 sticks for 1 emerald, but never for 2 emeralds. Additionally, no quantity can go lower than 1 or higher than the stack size.

How strongly demand and reputation affect the price is determined by the price multiplier. The discount from the Hero of the Village effect does not use the price multiplier.

Demand is tracked per item and is initially minus twice the number of times the villager has the trade in stock. Villagers restock twice per day, at which point they subtract the number of possible purchases before running out of stock and add twice the number of actually made purchases. When the demand becomes positive, the price is increased by the initial price times the price multiplier times the demand, rounded down.

[[Villager#Gossiping|Reputation]] is tracked per player by each villager, though villagers can share the reputation of players. Positive reputation gives price discounts and {{in|java}} negative reputation gives price penalties. [[Curing]] a zombie villager gives permanent major positive reputation, trading gives temporary positive reputation, and attacking or killing villagers gives temporary negative reputation. The price is decreased by the price multiplier times the reputation, rounded down, though it can only result in an overall price increase {{in|java}}.

The [[Hero of the Village]] effect, gained from completing a raid, reduces the price of all villagers by 30% of the initial price, rounded down but at least 1, and 6.25% per additional level.

The formula for the full price can be written as:

<math>\text{Final Price}=\min\left(\max\left(\left\lfloor p\cdot \left(m\cdot \max\left(0,d\right)+1\right)\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor m\cdot r\right\rfloor-\max\left(sign\left(h\right),\left\lfloor p\cdot \left(1-0.3\cdot sign\left(h\right)-0.0625\cdot \left(h-1\right)\right)\right\rfloor\right),1\right),\text{Stack Size}\right)</math>

where <math>p</math> is the initial price, <math>m</math> is the price multiplier, <math>d</math> is the demand, <math>r</math> is the reputation and <math>h</math> is the Hero of the Village level.

== Non-trading villagers ==
If the player attempts to trade with a non-trading villager {{in|java}}, it grunts and bobs its head, but if the player tries to do the same thing {{in|bedrock}}, nothing happens.

=== Nitwit ===
[[File:Nitwit refusing.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.4|A plains nitwit bobbing its head.{{Only|Java}}]]
Nitwits are green-coated villagers. They cannot gain a profession.

While they can be used for breeding, it is not possible to get a baby nitwit by breeding adult nitwits.

=== Unemployed villager ===
[[File:Villager refusing.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.4|An unemployed plains villager bobbing its head.{{Only|Java}}]]Villagers without a job cannot trade. They only wear their biome outfits. An unemployed villager gains a profession by claiming an unclaimed [[job site block]]. For example, an unclaimed [[cartography table]] converts an unemployed villager into a cartographer when the villager claims it, and both the villager and the table emit green particles. An inaccessible (or destroyed) job site block causes the connected villager to lose its profession, but that does not affect the player's [[popularity]] in the village.

=== Baby villagers ===
The appearance of baby villagers is the same as that of the corresponding adult unemployed villagers, but their bodies are smaller. They can't get a job or trade.<div style="clear: both;"></div>

The villager pictured on the right is from the plains biome. To see villager professions dressed for other biomes, see {{Section link|Villagers|Professions}}.

In {{JE}}, starting from Novice, at each level, two additional trades become available, unless there is only one trade within that level. If there are more than two possible trades, two are randomly selected.

In {{BE}}, one trade is chosen randomly from each slot available. For example, if there are two items in the same slot, then only one of them will show up in the trade.

[[File:Wandering Trader.png|thumb|right|upright=0.4|Wandering Trader]]

The [[wandering trader]] offers nine trades in total: two random trades from the purchasing table, two random trades from the special selling table, and five random trades from the ordinary selling table. These trades are not divided into categories; for example, a single wandering trader can sell 2 different saplings. Each trade is equally likely.{{verify}}

In the trading GUI, the trade offers are always listed in this order:<br>
* 2 purchasing trades
* 2 special selling trades 
* 5 ordinary selling trades

The implementation of [[village]]s themselves and their inhabitants wasn't even confirmed at this point, but Notch still had a couple of ideas: "If you treat the villagers well, they become friendly to you and might start throwing things at you as gifts.

|{{HistoryLine||1.4.2|dev=12w32a|The librarian's paper offer was adjusted to 24–35 [[paper]] per emerald from 19-29 paper.
|The farmer's arrow offer was fixed to sell 9-12 [[arrow]]s from only 5 before. The original 1 emerald for 5 arrows trade was a result of a bug in the code where the minimum and maximum values of the arrow trade were swapped.
|The librarian's buy book offer was adjusted to 11-12 [[book]]s from 12-14.
|The farmer's gravel to flint trade now produces 4-5 [[flint]] from 2-3.
|The offer probability mechanic was changed: as more offers exist for a villager, the probability of all offers rise. When an offer's probability goes beyond a certain limit, its probability goes down. The net effect is that rarer offers become more common when a villager has many offers, and common offers become rarer.
|The offer removal mechanic has been replaced with an offer disabling mechanic.
|All offers begin with 7 uses, allowing the offer to be traded up to seven times.
|After this, even if the player has not left the trading menu, the offer is disabled.
|If a player trades the last offer on the list and closes the menu, waiting for particles to appear around the villager, all disabled offers are renewed with 2–12 additional uses added to them.
|It is possible for the final offer slot to be disabled, at which point no new offers can be generated and no existing offers can be renewed.
|Trading with the last offer slot available increases the player's popularity with the village by one point. Popularity applies to the village as a whole; other players are not affected.}}
