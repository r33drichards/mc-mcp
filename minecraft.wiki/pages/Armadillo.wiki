An '''armadillo''' is a [[passive mob]] found in [[badlands]] and [[savanna]]s. It rolls up in response to being hurt or being near [[undead]] mobs or [[player]]s that are sprinting or mounted. While in this state, it takes less damage. It also repels [[spider]]s and [[cave spider]]s. It is the only source of [[armadillo scute]]s, which the armadillo sheds over time, as well as when it is [[brush]]ed.

== Spawning ==
Armadillos [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in groups of two to three {{Only|Java}} or four {{Only|Bedrock}} in [[savanna]]s, [[savanna plateau]]s, and [[windswept savanna]]s and in groups of one to two in [[badlands]], [[eroded badlands]], and [[wooded badlands]]. They spawn at a light level of 9 or more {{IN|java}} and a light level of 7 or more {{IN|bedrock}}.

{{IN|bedrock}}, armadillos have a 5% chance to spawn as a baby.

{{Mob spawn table|Armadillo}}

== Drops ==
Armadillos drop 1 [[armadillo scute]] every 5–10 minutes, similar to the rate at which [[chicken]]s lay [[egg]]s.

Upon successful [[breeding]] (see below), {{xp|1|7}} [[experience]] orbs are dropped.

=== On death ===
* {{xp|1|3}} experience orbs if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].
Killing a baby armadillo yields no [[item]]s nor [[experience]].

=== Brushing ===
If a player or [[dispenser]] {{Control|uses}} a [[brush]] on an armadillo, it drops:
* 1 {{ItemLink|Armadillo Scute}}
Brushing an armadillo uses 16 [[durability]] points, meaning an unenchanted brush has enough durability to obtain 4{{only|java|short=1}} / 5{{only|bedrock|short=1}} armadillo scutes.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Two Armadillos Rolled Up.png|thumb|Two armadillos rolled up.]]

[[Spider]]s and [[cave spider]]s flee from armadillos when within 6 blocks of them. This only takes effect when the armadillo is not rolled up in its shell.

=== Rolling up ===
An armadillo can hide in its shell when it is hurt, confronted by [[undead]], or confronted by players who are sprinting or riding anything. When an armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and is not tempted by food. While rolled up, it takes a reduced amount of damage given by <code>(original damage-1)/2</code>, damage belonging to the type <code>self_destruct</code> is not affected by this {{in|be}}. The armadillo occasionally peeks out from its shell to see if a threat is still near. It unrolls if it detects no threats for 3 seconds (60 ticks). It also unrolls immediately if it comes into contact with water or is attached to a [[lead]]. An armadillo does not roll up while fleeing, in water, on fire, in the air, or being led.

The distance an armadillo checks for threats is the size of its hitbox inflated by 7 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}

Armadillos follow players holding [[spider eye]]s within 10{{only|java|short=1}} / 16{{only|bedrock|short=1}} blocks. Additionally, baby armadillos follow adults.

A player can [[breed]] armadillos by using spider eyes on two of them. After breeding, a baby armadillo spawns and 1–7 [[experience]] is generated. The parents cannot be bred again for 5 minutes.

Baby armadillos take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} spider eyes. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.

An armadillo loses its willingness to breed if it rolls up after it is fed, but before it reaches its mate. It must be fed another spider eye to become willing to breed again.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The first iteration of the armadillo had deliberately basic animations due to feedback that the sniffer's animations were a bit too advanced. However, the developers felt that quality expectations had been raised, so subsequent armadillo animations were made more expressive.<ref>{{Tweet|JasperBoerstra|1736404493854445958|It's likely that we'll be re-doing all the animations. We tried going "back to basics" after feedback on the Sniffer's animations being to "advanced" but I think the expectations for quality has been raised so we'll have to meet those and make them more expressive :)|December 17, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|JasperBoerstra|1736407600978186662|Exactly! But we got feedback that they were.. too good for the rest of the animations, so with the Armadillo we tried going a bit more simple again; But I suppose people expect more advanced animations now instead. The expectation has shifted.|December 17, 2023}}</ref>
* When first added to the game, the armadillo had its eyes on the front of its face. According to [[Jasper Boerstra]] this is because he felt that it would be difficult for the player to form a personal connection with the armadillo if the eyes were on the side of the head, since they wouldn't be visible while facing the mob directly.<ref>{{tweet|jasperboerstra|1735374457957396921|The eyes of the Armadillo are in the front because when they are on the side you're looking at an empty forehead, It's difficult to a create a connection with it. Considering this is a mob which you'll interact with, possibly quite often, I felt like this was important.|December 14, 2023}}</ref> This decision was reverted following feedback.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1738963955786068362|We've listened to your feedback, here is a new iteration of the Armadillo. In Beta/Snapshots next year!👁️👄👁️.|December 24, 2023}}</ref>
** The tag on the armadillo plush however uses this initial design, despite the plush itself using its final design.
* In earlier development versions, though not entirely realistic, the armadillo's head peeked out when balled up because it was deemed amusing.<ref>{{tweet|jasperboerstra|1735375026193318017|Its head peeks out when its balled up because we thought it would be funny or cute. But apparently people prefer realism?|December 14, 2023}}</ref>
* Despite its passive nature, the armadillo has been referred to as a neutral mob on the official [[minecraft.net]] website.<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/22307322045197|title=Minecraft - Beta & ''Preview'' 1.20.60.23|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=December 13, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-preview-1-20-60-23|Minecraft Preview 1.20.60.23|December 13, 2023|Jay Wells}}</ref>
* The armadillo is the only mob voted in during a [[Mob Vote|mob vote]] that was released in a minor update (officially the ''[[Armored Paws]]'' drop as {{JE}} [[Java Edition 1.20.5|1.20.5]] and {{BE}} [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.80|1.20.80]]), instead of the [[Tricky Trials|next major update]].
** It is also the final mob to be added through a mob vote.
* The development time for the armadillo was the shortest for any mob vote winner, introduced in a [[Java Edition 23w51a|snapshot]] just two months after winning the vote at [[Minecraft Live 2023]].
