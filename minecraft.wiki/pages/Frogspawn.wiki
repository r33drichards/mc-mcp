'''Frogspawn''' is a non-solid block laid by [[frog]]s when they are [[bred]], which hatches into [[tadpole]]s over time. It cannot be obtained as an [[item]] or moved by a [[piston]].

== Obtaining ==
Frogspawn is unobtainable as an item in [[Survival]] mode. When broken, it always drops nothing, even if mined with a [[Silk Touch]] tool. 

=== Breaking ===
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Frogspawn|link=none|drop=0}}

=== Post-generation ===
Frogspawn is produced by one frog that has been [[bred]] with another. After two frogs are bred with [[slimeball]]s, one of them travels to the nearest water block or [[waterlogged]] block with air above, and lays a frogspawn block.

== Usage ==
=== Hatching ===
A random number of ticks between 3600 (3 minutes) and 12000 (10 minutes) is picked as a hatching delay. After delay passes, 2–5 [[Tadpole|tadpoles]] are spawned.

The hatching speed of frogspawn is not affected by the [[game rule]] <code>random_tick_speed</code>.<ref>{{bug|MC-249308}}</ref>

=== Placement ===
Frogspawn can be placed only on top of a [[water]] source block with air above it.
