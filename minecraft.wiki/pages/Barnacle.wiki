The '''barnacle''',<ref>{{ytl|vh04binv1bQ|MINECON Earth 2018 - The Minecraft Developers panel!|Minecraft|October 2, 2018|t=33m16s}}</ref> originally known as '''Mob A''' or the "'''Monster of the Ocean Depths'''",  was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2017 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[MINECON Earth 2017]], alongside the [[great hunger]], the [[phantom]] and the [[wildfire]].<ref>{{mcnet|announcing-minecon-earth|Announcing...

It was a [[squid]]-like ocean creature that sucks players down with its tentacle. The mob spawns in the [[deep ocean]] [[biome]] and has a large mouth that it uses to propel itself through the water and pull players down into the ocean. In a promotional video for the Mob Vote, [[Jeb]] encouraged players to vote for 'Mob A' as "the oceans currently don't have that much content, and it would make it more exciting when traveling from island to island."<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|930076496294760448|At this year's MINECON Earth, YOU decide which mob makes it into the game. Will you vote for Mob A, the Monster of the Ocean Depths? Get acquainted here!|November 13, 2017}}</ref> The function of whirlpools was later added with the addition of [[magma block]]s.

The barnacle was eliminated after the first poll, receiving only 23% of the votes.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|931937794951348224|Three mobs remain but only one gets added to the game! Vote for the mob you want added to Minecraft now|November 18, 2017}}</ref>
