A '''dragon head''' is a [[block]] that resembles a smaller version of the [[ender dragon]]'s [[head]]. It can only be obtained from [[End ship]]s.

== Obtaining ==
Unlike other [[mob heads]] obtainable in survival, the dragon head does not drop when [[Ender Dragon|its corresponding mob]] is killed by a [[charged creeper]].<ref>{{bug|MC-132933||Inconsistency: Player, Ender Dragon, and Wither don't drop their heads when killed by charged creeper|WAI}}</ref>

=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of dragon head.<ref>{{bug|MC-192905||Heads & Skulls have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Dragon Head}}
Dragon head drops itself when it's destroyed.
When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the dragon head will always drop as an item.

=== Natural generation ===
Dragon heads generate on [[End ship]]s found in [[End cities]].

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
Dragon heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to [[sign]]s. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

When placed and powered by redstone, the dragon head opens and closes its mouth repeatedly (2 times per second). The same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or [[armor stand]] (note: the animation does not play if the <code>NoGravity</code> tag is set to 1).

=== Wearing ===
{{See also|#Renders}}
The player can wear dragon heads, similarly to [[pumpkin]]s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

==== Disguise ====
Unlike most other heads, wearing a dragon head does ''not'' impact the behavior of a corresponding mob: the [[ender dragon]] attacks the player as usual.

Wearing a dragon head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]].

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a dragon head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

=== Enchantments ===
Dragon heads can receive the following [[enchantment]]s, but only through an [[anvil]].

=== Note blocks ===
Placing a dragon head above a [[note block]] causes the note block to play the [[ender dragon]]'s {{cd|ambient}} sound when activated.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Dragon head is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
