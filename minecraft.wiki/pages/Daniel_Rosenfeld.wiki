=== Unreleased third ''Minecraft'' volume ===
In 2015, Rosenfeld hinted at a potential upcoming third album for ''Minecraft'''s soundtrack, stating "I'll still work on Minecraft, so there'll probably be another album".<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.factmag.com/2015/09/05/minecraft-c418-interview/|title=Can You Dig It: FACT meets Minecraft composer C418|website=factmag|author=Tom Fenwick|date=September 5, 2015}}</ref> In 2017, he confirmed the future release, claiming the album "is still far from done".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20210308183610/https://twitter.com/C418/status/829667788897783809 I’m still far from done, but I tallied up a few numbers, and the third Minecraft soundtrack is gonna be longer than Alpha and Beta combined.] - {{tweet|C418}}, February 9, 2016</ref> He confirmed on Twitter that the third album would have not been called "Volume Gamma"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20210709191055/https://twitter.com/C418/status/822673435147046912 Minecraft Volume Gamma? nope]- {{tweet|C418}}, January 21, 2017</ref> and it would have be longer than the previous two albums combined (which in total is over 3 hours and 18 minutes).

In January 2021, Rosenfeld was asked in an interview whether there was still a third volume of the soundtrack in the works. He responded, "I have something—I consider it finished—but things have become complicated, especially as ''Minecraft'' is now a big property, so I don't know".<ref>{{ytl|4mn47MqhbFY|10 Years of the Minecraft Soundtrack - C418 INTERVIEW|fantano|January 7, 2021}}</ref> Later, in October 2021, when the Caves & Cliffs music was added to the game, he stated on [https://discord.com/invite/c418 his Discord server] "I still want to do stuff for minecraft, but I've never managed to get to an agreement with the big guys", and "I have a lot of music but only time will tell how we will get it out. It will involve at least 20 lawyers."<ref>{{reddit|qc2wxr/like_music_to_my_ears_minecraft_snapshot_21w42a|hheco6c|Please be respectful and remember not to take any of this out of context. From C418’s discord shortly after 21w42a released and discussion was going on about the new music and his Third Album:|Blainezab|October 20, 2021}}</ref>

In an April 2025 interview done with Kristin Robinson for Billboard Pro, Rosenfeld revealed that he had parted ways with Microsoft in terms of negotiations with his musical compositions with Minecraft, unable to compose new music for the game but desiring to work on other projects over Minecraft.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://www.billboard.com/pro/how-minecraft-score-became-big-business-for-composer|title=How the ‘Minecraft’ Game Score Unexpectedly Became Big Business For Its Composer|website=Billboard Pro|author=Kristin Robinson|date=April 16, 2025}}</ref> The details of his third album for the game remain unknown.

== Trivia ==

* His ''Minecraft'' skin is the [[Steve]] skin, but the head is replaced with a small variant of the texture for a [[jukebox]].
* C418 revealed in an AMA on Reddit that the [[ghast]] sounds are taken from his pet cat when he is disturbed while sleeping.<ref>{{reddit|sub=IAmA|nbe2h/i_am_the_composer_and_sound_designer_of_minecraft|c37sjyb|Well, to make this story short, my cat has this interesting behaviour of sounding very human if you disturb him while he's sleeping. It just so happens that a microphone was next to him when he complained.|C418|December 14, 2011}}</ref> He was also going to have his cat voice [[ocelot]]s, but since his cat never meows clearly, C418 decided to use cat sounds from Freesound instead.<ref>{{tweet|C418|164364075097272320|In other news my voice actor refuses to say his lines today.|January 31, 2012|archive=1}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|C418|164074775721947136|My voice actor (cat) finally did some lines (meowed) and I acutally captured it this time|January 30, 2012|archive=1}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|C418|166522516993622016|The only well recorded cat sounds I have are meowing with purring.

* C418's only uncredited work for ''Minecraft'' are songs that play on free maps in Battle mini game for Legacy Console Edition. Those are also the only songs that were never released as a part of any album.
* He performs the vocal sounds of [[villager]]s.<ref>[https://www.20k.org/episodes/minecraft <nowiki>Daniel also used his voice for the villagers who inhabit the strange, isolated towns. Dallas’s Daughter: All they go is “Hmm hmm hmm.” Daniel: I think some sound effects got lost with the villagers, because I originally did the "eh" sounds [sfx: Minecraft villager], but then I also made very contrasting sound effects for the children villagers. They were like, "Hahahaha." Like screechy little kids. And I'm kind of bummed that that never got into the game, because like what they put in the game ultimately was just the “eh” but pitched up, [sfx: Minecraft villager child] which was really bizarre for little children. Like “eeeh.”</nowiki>]</ref>
