A '''water bottle''' is a [[glass bottle]] filled with [[water]]. It can be {{Control|used|text=emptied}} onto [[dirt]] to convert it to [[mud]], and is a required base ingredient to [[brew]] any [[potion]].

'''[[Splash Potion|Splash water bottles]]''' and '''[[Lingering Potion|lingering water bottles]]''' are {{Control|throw}}able variants obtained via brewing.

== Obtaining ==
=== Glass bottle ===
Using a [[glass bottle]] on a [[water]] source returns a water bottle. This can be automated using a [[dispenser]].

Using a glass bottle on a water-filled [[cauldron]] also returns a water bottle, decreasing the water level in the cauldron by one level. This does not work with a dispenser.

=== Bartering ===
When given a [[gold ingot]], [[piglin]]s have a {{frac|10|469}} (~2.13%) chance to [[barter]] a water bottle.

=== Fishing ===
Water bottles can be fished up as junk items.

== Usage ==
===Base potions===
Water bottle is a base for multiple potions. Drinking it has no effect.

=== Mud conversion ===
{{control|Using}} a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], or [[rooted dirt]] converts it into [[mud]]. This process can be automated with a [[dispenser]]. When the regular, splash, or lingering water bottle is used, it leaves a [[glass bottle]] in its inventory slot.<ref>{{Bug|MC-259337}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MCPE-156390}}</ref> Throwing splash and lingering water bottles does not convert the dirt into mud, and does not leave a glass bottle behind.

=== Filling cauldron ===
A water bottle adds 1 water level to a cauldron.

=== Splash and lingering water bottles ===
Splash water bottles have no effect on almost all entities, but they extinguish fire in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.

A splash water bottle deals {{hp|1}} damage to [[endermen]], [[striders]], [[snow golems]], and [[blazes]]. Splash and lingering water bottles will also restore 1800 game ticks (90 seconds) of air to an [[axolotl]]. Splash water bottles can extinguish burning entities.

In ''Java Edition'', the lingering water bottle creates no effect cloud, while in ''Bedrock Edition'' it creates an effect cloud that extinguishes burning entities that walk into it.
