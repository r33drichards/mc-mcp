'''Guy''' is a [[character]] in the novels published by [[Max Brooks]], first appearing in ''[[Minecraft: The Island]]''. Suffering from amnesia, he washed ashore on a mysterious island within the ''Minecraft'' universe, and had to adapt to the internal logic to survive. After ridding the island of any hostile mobs, he decided to leave, and stumbled upon a [[The Mountain|mountain]] fortress owned by a second human, [[Summer]].

== Appearance ==
Though not explicitly said, it is heavily implied at several points that he takes on the appearance of [[Steve]], in particular Summer (who resembles [[Alex]] herself) singling out his beard. From the perspective of Guy, he can’t do anything that an actual Minecraft player wouldn’t, so he never gets a full look at himself. However, he describes his body as “painted on,” lacking the ability to move his fingers or position his arms in ways that aren’t absolutely necessary for the game’s mechanics. Most notably, instead of having a conventional inventory, he possesses a physical backpack and utility belt.

== Personality ==
Guy is a survivalist, devoid of any memory of his origins or the world surrounding him. Initially, he starts off somewhat paranoid and bewildered, struggling to adapt to his situation and the rules that bind it. However, even early on he has a distinct sense of humor, often giving [[mob]]s and sights nicknames. A zombie, for instance, he calls "Mr. Dead-Head", a [[skeleton]] "Boneyboy," a [[silverfish]] a "crabupine," [[chicken]]s a "chick-duck," and a large hill is consistently referred to as "Disappointment Hill.”

Over the course of his first two stories, he also becomes noticeably lonely and defensive. During the events of The Island, he befriends a number of animals; a cow he dubs Moo, a black sheep and white sheep named Flint and Cloud, and their gray offspring Rainy. He even gives his [[sword]]s the names Protector and Flash. By the time he meets Summer, he’s become very attached to animals, declaring himself a vegetarian and seeing them as friends. As such, he jumps at the opportunity to meet a second human and quickly befriends her.

Throughout his adventures, him and Summer also notably recount scarce details of their origins. In particular, Guy instinctively recognizes [https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/Graham King Graham], and recalls using a [[computer]] at multiple points. “Computers didn’t just help my life, they ''were'' my life.” When he eats a [[steak]], he recalls eating another that was pink itself, “and nothing past that.” In Chapter 10 (''Nothing Clears the Mind Like Sleep''), he remembers his eyes burning, hand cramping, and sitting too much; a sleepless night.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Washed up on a beach, the lone castaway looks around the shore. ''Where am I? Who am I? And why is everything made of blocks?'' But there isn’t much time to soak up the sun. It’s getting dark, and there’s a strange new world to explore!}}
== History ==

* ''[[Minecraft: The Island]]'' (first appearance)
* ''[[Minecraft: The Mountain]]''
* ''[[Minecraft: The Mountain (map)|Minecraft: The Mountain]]'' tie-in map (mentioned)
* ''[[Minecraft: The Village]]''

== Trivia ==
* Due to being implied to be an incarnation of Steve, the initial face of the game, and later being given the nondescript name of Guy, it can be inferred that he’s intended to represent the average player. The Island being a metaphor for learning the ropes, whereas the Mountain could be inspired by multiplayer.
