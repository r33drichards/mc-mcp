'''''Minecraft: The Great Wild''''' is a series on the ''Minecraft'' YouTube channel where [[biomes]] are described for a brief period of time, meant to evoke a nature documentary. 

== Episodes ==

=== Cold Biomes ===
{{Infobox video|date=May 6, 2023|length=5:25|image=Cold Biomes title card.png}}{{YT|oP9XgxAflkI}}

==== Summary ====
As the [[sun]] rises over a [[frozen ocean]], a herd of [[goats]] are illuminated, two screaming. A narrator regards the arctic as the "very first biome," saying it appeared not as a place, but as a climate. They go on to explain various species that have adapted to the climate, such as the [[rabbit]], arguing they blend in with the [[Snow Block|snow]]. Very soon, a [[Wolf|predator]] emerges, hiding behind [[Short Grass|grass]]. However, it does not end up provoking the rabbit, turning around after it hops.

Another predator appears as the first parts ways, the [[fox]]. Calling the rabbit "very unlucky, indeed!" the fox begins to chase after the rabbit, and then pounces onto it. In the end, the fox fails to catch the rabbit, or any others. It returns to its den, a small [[lush cave]], sad that it can't feed its children as it and its kin slumber. The focus shifts to a [[mountain]], "among the most hostile of places," where [[polar bears]] have had to adapt, which explains their fur. The narrator then says they are dangerous by nature, as a parent and cub make noises.

The fox returns, not hunting for food on [[Iceberg (feature)|icebergs]]. The polar bear, deeming it a threat to its cubs, begins an attack. Now, the fox is the prey, as it runs away and decides to hunt somewhere less dangerous. As the video begins to wrap up, the narrator ponders "what does the fox say?" as it screeches in pain.

=== Ocean ===
{{Infobox video|date=June 17, 2023|length=4:49|image=Oceans title card.png}}{{YT|FRBGEdXAkvU}}

==== Summary ====
The narrator fascinates over the depth and mystery of the [[ocean]], welcoming the viewers into it. They highlight the diversity, highlighting amphibious species like [[turtles]]. After explaining how they're fast in the water and slow on land, they begin to explain mating rituals. A baby turtle is [[Turtle Egg|laid]], and then long after born, the narrator praising their unique size. Shortly after hatching, the baby turtle meets its first predator, in the form of a [[cat]]. It manages to get away by swimming, others not being as lucky.

As the narrator looks into the emptiness of the sea, they find solace with [[dolphin]]s. Calling it majestic, they explain the dolphin's [[neutral]] behavior. The subject changes to their adventurous nature, traveling long distances to find food, an exception being an [[ocean monument]]. [[Guardians]] are introduced by their commitment to the monuments, slaughtering several squids. Moving away from the monument, it's revealed that a cat (presumed to be the same as before, despite being a different type) is still searching for the turtle, now lost at sea.

=== Lush Caves ===
{{Infobox video|length=3:26|date=August 4, 2023|image=Lush Caves title card.png}}{{YT|KlVjIdI-Qqc}}

==== Summary ====
Entering through an [[old growth taiga]], the narrator introduces the viewer to the beauty of a [[lush cave]]. Calling the plentiful [[Cave Vines (feature)|cave vines]] stunning, they concede it's easy to get mesmerized, showing several [[bats]] burning to death by a drip of [[lava]]. They then point out that [[glow berries]] make it harder for hostile mobs to spawn, if not impossible.

The topic changes to a gold [[axolotl]], crawling over [[clay]] and [[diorite]] into an [[aquifer]], before swimming through an expansive lake. The narrator boasts that they can survive on land for over "6,000 [[Tick|ticks]]!" and eat [[tropical fish]]. As a [[drowned]] appears, an axolotl plays dead, and defeats it. As more fights occur, the narrator takes an interest in an [[enderman]], spying on the cave from afar. The feed apparently stares into the enderman's eyes, and is destroyed, before the narrator concludes the video like nothing happened, panning out of a [[Frozen Peaks|mountain]] into the taiga once more.

=== Jungle ===
{{Infobox video|length=3:18|date=August 4, 2023|image=Jungle title card.png}}{{YT|xtCsIWBGG68}}

==== Summary ====
A panda rolls around on [[Grass Block|grass]] and [[podzol]], enjoying life. The narrator remarks life should be easy, but isn't in the [[jungle]]. The perspective shifts to an [[ocelot]], prowling grounds in search of a [[chicken]] to prey on. The chicken manages to get away. As it rains, a strike of [[Thunderstorm|lightning]] starts a [[fire]], as a panda worries. A [[skeleton]] walks by, scaring it further. Once the rain clears, a brown panda appears. Another panda sneezes.

Seemingly provoked, an aggressive panda begins following the camera. The focus changes to a red [[parrot]], swimming in a puddle. The narrator then vents about the dangers and mystique of the jungle, before revealing that the chicken at the start has since become a [[chicken jockey]], which it apparently enjoys.

=== Nether ===
{{Infobox video|length=4:30|image=The Nether title card.png|date=August 26, 2023}}{{YT|-7LsK-RtAWY}}

==== Summary ====
In the depths of [[The Nether]], far from sunlight, aggression and territorial defense dominate. To enter this realm, a [[portal]] must be built, opening the door to a hostile but intriguing environment filled with [[lava]] and danger. Survival requires adaptation, as seen with the [[strider]], which thrives in extreme heat. Meanwhile, the [[piglins]], obsessed with gold, patrol their territory and defend their treasures fiercely.

Unexpected alliances form in this unforgiving world, such as a [[zombified piglin]] riding a strider, a partnership that could be life-saving when faced with threats like the aggressive [[zoglin]]. The zoglin, driven by its instinct, fails in its attempt to attack, leaving uncertainty about its motives. The Nether is a dangerous but fascinating place, with much to explore, including the [[bastion]] and [[nether fortress]]. As the video concludes, it hints at the unknown mysteries that still await in "The Great Wild."

=== Desert & Mangrove Swamp ===
{{Infobox video|length=4:59|image=Desert & Mangrove Swamps title card.png|date=January 3, 2024}}{{YT|NQFaqrUVyro}}

==== Summary ====
In the harsh [[desert]], life persists against all odds, with [[camels]]&mdash;the nomads of nature&mdash;thriving in the sand. [[Desert villages]] serve as oases, where survival requires cooperation. A pair of camels, including a newborn calf, begins their journey across the desert, but danger follows in the form of a [[zoglin]]. The baby camel must flee, hiding in hope of reunion. Fortunately, the caravan is soon reunited, ready to continue their adventure.

The journey leads to the contrasting [[mangrove swamp]], where life abounds. Here, roots rise above the water, and [[tadpoles]] embark on their life journeys. A clever [[frog]] hunts a [[Slime|small slime]], demonstrating that even the smallest creatures have a part to play in the ecosystem. The desert and swamp are both filled with their own challenges and mysteries, but peace is often disrupted by new threats in this wild world.

=== The End ===
{{Infobox video|date=March 22, 2024|length=4:32|image=The End title card.png}}{{YT|x804YF6jMJ8}}

==== Summary ====
In the dark void of [[The End]], danger is ever-present for creatures like the [[Enderman]], who are no strangers to threats. This mysterious realm, disconnected from space and time, appears desolate but is home to life. The [[chorus plant]] grows exclusively on [[end stone]], while the simplistic flora contrasts with the complex [[end cities]], which offer hidden treasures and dangers. [[Shulkers]], masters of disguise, lie in wait to attack those who venture too close.

The End provides a comfortable environment for the teleporting endermen, a peaceful mob—most of the time. However, when disturbed, they move with purpose. Overseeing the realm is the [[ender dragon]], the ruler of this unknown place. Dependent on [[end crystals]] for survival, the dragon allows no one to approach. Even when the endermen seem to unite, friendship with the dragon is not on the horizon.

Despite its emptiness, the End is filled with wonders, mysteries, and hidden treasures. The dragon fiercely protects something—perhaps the portal, or maybe something deeper. The End holds many secrets waiting to be uncovered in "The Great Wild."

== Trivia ==

* The narrator asking "what does the fox say" is a reference to the electric dance song {{Wikipedia|The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)|The Fox}}, which was created as an "anti-hit" song. Ironically, it would go on to become a viral sensation in 2013, leading to its reference in the video.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ylvis-the-fox|title=Ylvis - The Fox|author=Blinkerbot|website=Know Your Meme}}</ref>
