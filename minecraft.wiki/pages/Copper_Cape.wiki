The '''Copper Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out to promote [[The Copper Age]].

== Appearance ==
The cape's design depicts a variation of the pattern that appears on [[Chiseled Copper|chiseled copper]] and the top of [[Copper Chest|copper chests]]. This pattern has various stages of [[Oxidation|oxidization]], with the top of the cape depicting copper that is not oxidized, and the bottom of the cape depicting fully oxidized copper.

The [[elytra]] design uses a similar oxidization gradient, but depicts [[Copper Grate|copper grates]] instead.

== Distribution ==
