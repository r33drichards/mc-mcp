'''12w34b''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.4.2]], released on August 24, 2012<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/08/minecraft-snapshot-12w34b</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[12w34a]] snapshot.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Boss]]es'''
* Added boss names above boss health.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
{{Animate|Stone Wall Button (S) JE2 BE1.png;Oak Wall Button (S) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} '''[[Button]]s'''
* Changed recipes for stone/wood buttons. 
** Now require 1 [[stone]] block/[[planks]] to craft.

=== Items ===
'''[[Armor]]'''
* Leather and diamond armor textures slightly changed:
** Leather armor sleeves are extended by one pixel.
** Their item texture has been changed to match the new texture.
* Diamond armor sleeves now have a notch on the inner side.

[[File:Map (item) JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Map]]s'''
* Now have a ''zoom level'', which was fixed at 1:8 prior to snapshot [[12w34a]],<ref name="mapinfo">https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/4988431144/the-maps</ref> but now starts at 1:1 and can be increased up to 1:16 by re-crafting an existing map.
* Are no longer numbered on the top-left corner and is labeled through the tooltip.

=== Mobs ===
{{Animate|Zombie JE2 BE1.png;Skeleton JE4 BE2.png;Zombified Piglin JE3 BE2.png|28px}} '''[[Mob|Hostile mobs]]'''
* Occasionally, [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, and [[zombie pigmen]] spawn with the ability to pick up items on the ground.
** Armor automatically equips. Items are held instantly, which is not exclusive to weapons. This means zombies can be found holding items they have come across, such as [[rotten flesh]].
** This causes zombie pigmen to drop their sword, and skeletons to drop their bow.
** The attribute applied to allow them to pick up items is called ''[[Chunk format#Mobs|CanPickUpLoot]]''.

[[File:Zombified Piglin JE3 BE2.png|width=45x45]] '''[[Zombified Piglin|Zombie Pigmen]]'''
* In the Overworld, zombie pigmen are eager to get back in the nether portal (e.g., if the player makes a portal and spawns zombie pigmen in Creative, they run into the portal).

[[File:Wither JE1 BE1.png|width=64x64]] '''[[Wither]]s'''
* When taken down to half health, they gain wither armor, making them immune to [[arrow]]s.

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed [[item frame]] crashes.
* Fixed some [[nether portal]] stuff.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* This snapshot is one of only three snapshots for {{JE}} to have its digits consecutively increasing by one. The only other snapshots to have this property are [[Java Edition 12w34a|12w34a]] and [[Java Edition 23w45a|23w45a]].
