[[File:kz.png|thumb|<samp>kz.png</samp> {{in|BE}}.]]

<samp>'''kz.png'''</samp> is a [[texture atlas]] used for storing textures of [[painting]]s. Paintings added in [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.0]] and later versions are stored in their own texture files, but this atlas is still used for older paintings and the back texture.

<samp>'''paintings_kristoffer_zetterstrand.png'''</samp> was a texture atlas found inside <samp>[[minecraft.jar]]</samp> used for storing textures of paintings {{in|JE}}.

== Format ==
[[File:Kz MER.png|thumb|<samp>kz_mers.tga</samp>, edited to ignore the subsurface scattering to prevent all pixels from rendering transparent, subsurface scattering is 0 for the whole file.]]
<samp>kz.png</samp> is a fixed-width 256×256-pixel file that is split into different 16×16 squares which correspond to the texture of each painting. A separate file, <samp>kz_mers.tga</samp>, stores the MERS values of individual pixels on all paintings, used in [[Vibrant Visuals]].

Like with <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp>, <samp>[[items.png]]</samp> and <samp>[[particles.png]]</samp>, paintings were originally stored on a main [[texture atlas]] rather than being separate individual files. Empty slots were filled in with the magenta grid texture.

== Trivia ==
* The "Kz" in the name "<samp>Kz.png</samp>" stands for "[[Kristoffer Zetterstrand]]", the artist of the majority of the Minecraft paintings, indicated by the fact that the file was renamed "<samp>paintings_kristoffer_zetterstrand.png</samp>" in [[Java Edition 1.6]].
