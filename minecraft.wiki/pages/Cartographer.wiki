A '''cartographer''' is a [[villager]] that [[trade]]s various maps, compasses, as well as banners and banner patterns. Cartographers wear a golden monocle and an empty map pack.

== Spawning ==
An unemployed [[villager]] turns into an cartographer when an unclaimed [[cartography table]] is nearby.

=== Natural generation ===
The workstation of cartographers, the [[cartography table]], generates in cartographer houses in [[village]]s.

== Drops ==
{{IN|java}}, a cartographer can drop various items by throwing them as a gift towards a nearby player with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect. The gift is randomly selected from the following list:
*{{ItemLink|Empty Map}}
*{{ItemLink|Paper}}

== Trading ==

=== Biome-dependent trades ===
The apprentice-level explorer maps and expert-level banners that cartographers sell depend on their biome variant. The table below shows which maps and banners each biome variant can have in stock.

=== Biome-dependent probabilities ===
Glass panes and item frames can be sold by cartographers from any biome, but the probabilities of these trades depend on the biome the villager is from. This is because the amount of explorer maps or banners they can sell varies based on the villager's biome; this changes the total amount of trades they can pick from, affecting the chance of each individual trade at apprentice or expert level.
