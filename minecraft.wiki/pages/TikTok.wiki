== Trivia ==
* Since official Minecraft accounts on Douyin (Chinese domestic equivalent) are ran independently by ''China Edition'', awards related to ''Minecraft'' are not avaliable in Douyin.
* Due to Chinese censorship, it is not allowed to talk about certain topics on TikTok. (i.e. {{w|Tiananmen Square}}, {{w|Taiwan}}, etc.){{cn}} Accounts that do not obey this rule will get banned.{{cn}} This includes Minecraft content too.
* There was a social media called {{w|Musical.ly}} that was later bought by ByteDance, the company that founded TikTok, on November 10, 2017 and merged into TikTok on August 2, 2018.
