'''Potato oil''' is a joke [[item]] added in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Refinement ===
Refining a [[potato]] in a [[potato refinery]] with a [[glass bottle]] in the bottle slot outputs 1 potato oil. This takes {{convert|125|ticks|seconds}} and grants {{experience|0.1}}.

== Usage ==
To drink potato oil, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking it gives the player the "[[It's very slippery]]" effect for 1 tick and returns an empty bottle.

=== Lubrication ===
Potato oil can be used to lubricate any item using a [[potato refinery]] by placing the potato oil into the first item slot and the item to lubricate into the second item slot.

== Lubricated items ==
When an item is lubricated using potato oil, it gains the lubrication component with a level of 1. This causes the item to slide around when dropped, as though it was on [[ice]].
