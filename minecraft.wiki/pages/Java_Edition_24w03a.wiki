'''24w03a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], released on January 17, 2024<ref>{{snap|24w03a|id=a|January 17, 2024}}</ref> which adds the <code>spawnChunkRadius</code> [[game rule]], changes the textures of armadillo-related features, and fixes bugs. This is the first snapshot released in 2024.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added triggers:
** <code>default_block_use</code>, triggered due to the default interaction of a block by a player, such as opening a door.
** <code>any_block_use</code>, triggered due to any type of interaction with a block by a player, such as using an item on the block or its default usage.

=== General ===
'''[[Game rule]]s'''
* Added <code>spawnChunkRadius</code> to set the size of the spawn chunks.
** Defaults to <code>2</code>, equivalent to 3×3 entity ticking chunks.
** Possible values are <code>0</code> to <code>32</code>, where <code>0</code> completely disables the spawn chunks and <code>10</code> is equivalent to the functionality before this change.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Added transfer packets.
** Custom servers can now request that clients connect to another server with a new packet.
** When a client is transferred, it connects to the target server with a new transfer intent (id 3).
** By default, servers don't accept incoming transfers and disconnect the client.
*** This can be changed by setting the <code>accepts-transfers</code> property to <code>true</code> in the <code>server.properties</code> file.
** Resource packs are maintained across transfers.
** In the case of a transfer, custom servers can skip authentication with a new flag.
* Added cookie packets.
** Cookie packets allow custom servers to request and store data on a client.
*** Each cookie may be up to 5 KiB in size.
*** Cookies may be requested during login, configuration and play phases — but only stored during the configuration and play phases.
** Cookies are persisted across server transfers but are not persisted when the player disconnects.
*** This allows servers to pass along information such as authentication or custom game data to the new server.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the following block tag:
** <code>#armadillo_spawnable_on</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|#animals_spawnable_on|#terracotta|red_sand|coarse_dirt}}
*** Controls which blocks the [[armadillo]] can spawn on.
* Added the following entity type tags:
** <code>#aquatic</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|axolotl|cod|dolphin|elder_guardian|glow_squid|guardian|pufferfish|salmon|squid|tadpole|tropical_fish|turtle}}
** <code>#arthropod</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|bee|endermite|silverfish|spider|cave_spider}}
** <code>#ignores_poison_and_regen</code>: contains <code>#undead</code>
*** Controls which entities cannot be affected by [[Poison]] and [[Regeneration]] effects.
** <code>#illager</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|evoker|illusioner|pillager|vindicator}}
** <code>#illager_friends</code>: contains <code>#illager</code>
*** Controls which entities [[illager]]s consider allies (unless on a different team).
** <code>#inverted_healing_and_harm</code>: contains <code>#undead</code>
*** Controls which entities that have inverted meanings of the Healing and Harming effects.
** <code>#not_scary_for_pufferfish</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|cod|dolphin|elder_guardian|glow_squid|guardian|pufferfish|salmon|squid|tadpole|tropical_fish|turtle}}
*** Controls which entities don't cause [[pufferfish]] to puff.
** <code>#sensitive_to_bane_of_arthropods</code>: contains <code>#arthropod</code>
*** Controls which entities are sensitive to [[Bane of Arthropods]].
** <code>#sensitive_to_impaling</code>: contains <code>#aquatic</code>
*** Controls which entities are sensitive to [[Impaling]].
** <code>#wither_friends</code>: contains <code>#undead</code>
*** Controls which entities that the [[wither]] doesn't target and which cannot harm the wither.
* Added the following item tags:
** <code>#chest_armor</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|leather_chestplate|chainmail_chestplate|golden_chestplate|iron_chestplate|diamond_chestplate|netherite_chestplate}}

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Armadillo Scute JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Armadillo scute]]'''
* The texture was changed.

'''[[File:Wolf Armor (model) JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Wolf armor]]'''
* The texture was changed.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Armadillo JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Armadillo]]s'''
* The texture was changed, with the eyes no longer being located on the front of its head, now being on the sides.
* Can now spawn in [[badlands]] biomes.

'''[[Cave spider]]s & [[spider]]s'''
* Are now scared of armadillos not in a rolled up state.

'''[[Slime]]s'''
* Hitbox side length for sizes 0, 1, 3 (small, medium, big) changed from 0.5202, 1.0404, 2.0808 to 0.52, 1.04, 2.08, respectively.

'''[[Magma cube]]s'''
* Hitbox side length for sizes 0, 1, 3 (small, medium, big) changed from 0.5202, 1.0404, 2.0808 to 2.04, 4.08, 8.16, respectively.<ref>{{bug|MC-267927}}</ref>

'''[[Wolves]]'''
* The texture of the collar layer was adjusted.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[End portal]]'''
* When entities leave or enter [[the End]], the area they arrive in now stays loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of [[nether portal]]s.

'''[[Spawn chunk]]s'''
* The size of the spawn chunks changed from radius 10 (19x19 entity ticking chunks) to radius 2 (3×3 entity ticking chunks).
** This was done to reduce memory usage, loading times and CPU usage.
** The developers opted to not fully remove spawn chunks to allow players who currently utilize this functionality to continue to do so.

=== General ===
'''Accessibility'''
* The default focus is now always set when entering or exiting any menu while navigating using tab or arrow keys.

'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Renamed <code>generic.block_interaction_range</code> to <code>player.block_interaction_range</code>.
* Renamed <code>generic.entity_interaction_range</code> to <code>player.entity_interaction_range</code>.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>28</code>.
* The <code>minecraft:sweeping</code> enchantment has been renamed to <code>minecraft:sweeping_edge</code>.

'''NBT data'''
* Custom villager trades can be configured to accept items that have different tags from the expected item by adding <code>ignoreTags: true</code> in the trade's NBT.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>24</code>.
* The <code>ttf</code> font provider transforms have been adjusted to have more reasonable defaults.
** <code>shift</code> is no longer applied double, and now directly represents a number of pixels in the game UI.
** The font EM square is fitted to <code>size</code> pixels in the game UI, instead of between the font ascender and font descender.
** The font baseline is positioned consistently with the default font (7 pixels below line top).
** This means that generally, any font with a <code>size</code> of 9 and no <code>shift</code> should look correct by default.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the [[Update 1.21]] experimental data pack is enabled, the exception to this is the change to villagers, which takes effect when the [[Villager Trade Rebalance]] experimental data pack is enabled.
