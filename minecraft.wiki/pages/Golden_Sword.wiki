A '''golden sword''' is a variant of [[sword]] crafted from [[gold ingot]]s. It is the seventh-highest [[tier]] of sword, dealing the same damage as a [[wooden sword]] but having less durability. It can be [[Piglin#Piglin loved items|admired]] by piglins, and has the highest [[enchantability]].

==Obtaining==
===Mob loot===
[[Piglin]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s have an 8.5% chance of dropping it when naturally held. The dropped sword has a random durability. Each level of [[Looting]] used to kill the piglin increases the drop chance by 1%.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|golden-sword,random-enchanted-golden-sword}}

===Crafting===
{{Crafting
  |name=Golden Sword
  |B1=Gold Ingot
  |B2=Gold Ingot
  |B3=Stick
  |Output=Golden Sword
  |type=Combat
}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes bamboo, despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.<ref>{{bug|MC-195168||Swords consume double the durability than they normally would when destroying bamboo saplings, bamboo, or cobwebs}}</ref>

If a sword is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], either using [[Creative]] or [[commands]], cobwebs hit by the sword drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual string, because a sword is classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.

==== Creative mode ====
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as [[minecart]]s, [[painting]]s, [[item frame]]s,{{only|java}} and [[armor stand]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-27140}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-18463}}</ref>

=== Attacking ===
{{main|Sword#Attacking}}

A golden sword is used to deal [[damage]] to mobs and entities by {{control|attacking}} them. Golden swords have {{hp|4}} base damage {{in|je}} and {{hp|5}} base damage {{in|be}}, and can be enchanted to deal more damage.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
{{Crafting

|description=The durability of the two swords is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.

{{Grinding

|ingredients=2x Damaged Golden Sword

|description=The durability of the two swords is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.
}}
Two golden swords can be combined in an anvil. This preserves all enchantments on the sword, unlike using a crafting table or grindstone.

==== Anvil repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
| head=1
| Damaged Golden Sword
| Damaged Golden Sword; Gold Ingot
| Golden Sword
| tail=1
}}

A golden sword can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[gold ingot]]s, with each repair material restoring 25% the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden swords can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the sword's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A golden sword can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Smelting ingredient ===
{{Smelting|showname=1|Golden Sword|Gold Nugget|0,1}}

=== Distracting piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s are attracted to golden swords, run toward any golden swords on the ground, and inspect them for 6 to 8 seconds before putting them in their [[inventory]] slot. During this time, the piglin does not attack nearby players, even if they are not wearing gold armor.
