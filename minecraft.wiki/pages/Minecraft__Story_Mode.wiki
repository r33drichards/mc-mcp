In June 2018, [[Netflix]] and Telltale signed a partnership agreement, and the first season of the game ''Minecraft: Story Mode'' was announced to be released on Netflix on November 7, 2018.<ref>{{citation|url=https://techradar.com/news/netflix-to-add-games-to-its-service-including-stranger-things-and-minecraft|title=Netflix to bring Minecraft: Story Mode to service - but not traditional games|author=Nick Pino|website=Tech Radar|date=June 13, 2018}}</ref> Due to unknown reasons, the release date was pushed to November 27, 2018.

''Story Mode'' was removed from Netflix on December 5, 2022.<ref>Source can be found [[:File:StoryModeNetflixExitDate.jpg|here]].</ref>

A sequel, {{el|sm2}}, was released on July 11, 2017, featuring new storylines and characters.

On May 31, 2019, it was announced that ''Minecraft: Story Mode'' would no longer be supported following the closure of Telltale Games.

{{q|The interactive storytellers at Telltale are giving players the chance to explore their own unique interpretation of the Minecraft universe. They've crafted a story that follows the logic of Minecraft, but still manages to feel original. It's actually pretty funny too. And the pig is adorable.|[[Owen Jones]]<ref name=StoryQuote/>}}
The idea for ''Minecraft: Story Mode'' came around the end of 2012 when Telltale was engaged in work for ''Tales from the Borderlands'', an episodic series based on the ''Borderlands'' series. The idea of developing stories around other established video game franchises led the team to brainstorm the idea for a ''Minecraft''-related game, given that the game was essentially a "blank canvas" for storytelling, according to Job Stauffer, and would create an interesting challenge.<ref name=StoryModeverge/> Telltale began negotiations with Mojang Studios at GDC 2013, and began work on the title shortly thereafter.<ref name=StoryModeverge/> Stauffer noted that Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang Studios was not a factor in the game's development, as their interaction with Mojang Studios began well before Microsoft's offers.<ref name=StoryModeverge/> 

Telltale opted to create a new main character of Jesse for ''Minecraft: Story Mode'' instead of using the default "Steve" and "Alex" characters from ''Minecraft'', feeling that they did not want to attempt to rewrite how players already saw these characters in the game.<ref>{{citation|url=https://theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/minecraft-story-mode-spin-off-game-announced-mojang|title=Minecraft: Story Mode spin-off game announced by Mojang|author=Keith Stuart|website=The Guardian|date=December 19, 2014}}</ref> Other primary characters in the game are loosely designed around archetypes of common player-characters for Minecraft, such as those who engage in building, fighting, or griefing other players.<ref name=GamasutraStory>{{citation|url=https://gamasutra.com/view/news/255574/The_unlikely_creative_relationship_behind_Minecraft_Story_Mode.php|title=The unlikely creative relationship behind Minecraft: Story Mode|author=Richard Moss|website=Gamasutra|date=October 9. 2015}}</ref> The game does not attempt to provide any background for some concepts in Minecraft, such as the creepers, to avoid the various fan interpretations of such elements, though they will be elements of the game's story.<ref name=GamasutraStory/>

Stauffer stated that the game's story was intended to be family-friendly, similar to ''The Goonies'' or ''Ghostbusters'';<ref name=StoryModeverge/> their intended content would be equivalent to a PG-13 or PEGI-12 rating.<ref name=GamasutraStory/> A number of the voice actors are alumni of such films of the 1980s such as Corey Feldman who starred in ''The Goonies'', and the game includes various references to these types of films.<ref name=GamasutraStory/> Stauffer reflected that while Telltale's more recent games like ''The Walking Dead'' were more mature stories, their original adventure games like ''Sam & Max'' and ''Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People'' were written as family-friendly, and that they consider their approach to ''Story Mode'' as "part of our DNA". The story was written to be accessible both to existing players of ''Minecraft'' – both novice and advanced players – and to new audiences outside of the game.<ref name=StoryModeverge/>

''Minecraft: Story Mode'' was formally announced in December 2014 as a collaboration project between Mojang Studios and [[Telltale Games]]; the announcement was presented as an interactive adventure game named "Info Quest II".<ref>{{citation|url=https://pcmag.com/news/telltale-games-mojang-team-up-for-minecraft-story-mode|title=Telltale Games, Mojang Team Up for 'Minecraft: Story Mode'|author=David Murphy|website=PCMag|date=December 18, 2014}}</ref> Its first trailer was released during the [[MINECON]] convention in early July 2015. Telltale confirmed that they would release the game for the Wii U, representing the first time a Minecraft game has been released on a Nintendo platform.<ref name=StoryModeverge/>

On August 24, 2015, Winters posted on Twitter (now X) that she had completed voiceover work for the game but didn't specify whether she voiced a character or did some narration for the game.<ref name=LydiaVoiceStory>{{tweet|LydiaWinters|635846257865527296|Just finished doing voiceover work for our @telltalegames Minecraft: Story Mode! I definitely want to do more of that. Who needs me? :)|August 24, 2015}}</ref> 

On August 28, 2015, it was announced that the player will be able to choose the appearance of the main character, Jesse.<ref name=StoryModeCharacter/>

On October 7, 2015, Anadel, an atmospheric folk band based in {{w|Napa, California}}, announced that they had composed the music for the game.<ref name="facebook.com"/>

== Episodes ==
The game is divided into five separately sold episodes, released in intervals between 2 weeks and 3 months.
