An '''activator rail''' is a type of [[rail]] that, if [[powered]], can eject [[entities]] from regular [[minecart]]s, lock [[hopper minecart]]s and ignite [[TNT minecart]]s. If not powered, it can only unlock locked hopper minecarts.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The correct tool to break an activator rail is a [[pickaxe]]. It will always drop itself when broken, regardless of the tool used.

== Usage ==
An activator rail can be used as a rail and as a redstone component.

To place an activator rail, {{control|use}} an activator rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the activator rail should occupy. An activator rail can be placed on:
* the '''top''' of any full solid [[opaque]] block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components ([[command block]]s, [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, [[note block]]s, and [[redstone lamp]]s)
* the '''top''' of a [[hopper]], upside-down [[slab]], or upside-down [[stairs]].
*the '''top''' of any transparent block (glass, etc.)

An activator rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the activator rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach an activator rail to the side of the fence causes the activator rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.

When placed, an activator rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent [[rail]]s (including [[detector rail]]s, [[powered rail]]s, and other activator rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. The behaviors {{in|je|be}} diverge in the following ways.

{{IN|je}}:

: If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, or no adjacent rails at all, an activator rail aligns itself in the direction the player is facing. If an existing activator rail is connected to only one other rail or none at all, and a new rail is placed perpendicular to the activator rail, then the activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction (if it isn't already facing that way). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail "prefers" west or south). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.{{testingame}}

{{IN|be}}:

: If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the activator rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail "prefers", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.

It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.<ref>{{bug|MC-182709|||Invalid}}</ref>

=== Rail ===
{{main|Rail}}

Activator rails (and other rails) can be used as "roads" for [[minecart]]s. A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from either end of the activator rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with [[powered rail]]s). A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the activator rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted activator rail.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

Activator rails can be used to affect minecarts that travel over them.

; Activation

: An activator rail is a [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|redstone mechanism]] and can be activated by:
:* an adjacent active '''[[power component]]''' (for example, a [[redstone torch]], a [[block of redstone]], a [[daylight sensor]], etc.)
:* an adjacent '''powered block''' (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)
:* a powered '''[[redstone comparator]]''' or '''[[redstone repeater]]''' facing the activator rail
:* powered '''[[redstone dust]]''' configured to point at the activator rail, or configured as a plus sign. An activator rail is ''not'' activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.
:* {{IN|be}}, activator rails can only activate on input/consumer redstone ticks ([[C-tick]]).

: An activated activator rail also activates any adjacent activator rails it is connected to, up to eight away from the original activation source. Thus a single activation source can activate up to 17 rails (one original in the middle and eight on either side). An activated activator rail does not activate adjacent rails not connected to it.
: Activation and deactivation are instant and occur in the same gametick the power source turns on or off (any eventual delay depends on the power source).

; Behavior

An activator rail affects minecarts above it with varying effects that occur as soon as any part of the minecart is on the activator rail.

An ''active'' activator rail:
* starts shaking, and ejects mobs (including players) from minecarts — the destination location is picked the same way as when [[Minecart#Dismounting|dismounting]] a minecart
* repeatedly activates [[minecarts with command blocks]] — a command block minecart executes its command every four game ticks until the command block minecart is no longer on the activator rail
* disables [[minecarts with hoppers]] — a disabled hopper minecart cannot pick up items it travels through until it is enabled by an inactive activator rail (or until it is broken and re-placed)
* primes [[minecarts with TNT]] — primed TNT minecarts explode after four seconds with an explosive power proportional to their speed over the activator rail.

An ''inactive'' activator rail enables [[minecarts with hoppers]] — an enabled hopper minecart picks up items it travels through until it is disabled by an active activator rail.

A hopper minecart stops picking up items in the same tick it touches an active activator rail or in the same tick the inactive rail it is standing on is powered (it does not collect the item it could have taken from a container above in the same tick the activator rail turns on and takes the first item in the same tick the rail turns off again).

=== Mob interaction ===
Like other types of rails, [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[warden]]s are the only land mobs that can walk onto activator rails.{{only|java}}

=== Piston interactivity ===
An activator rail can be pushed by a [[piston]], and can be pulled by a [[sticky piston]]. However, it breaks and drops as an item when it is unsupported due to being moved.
