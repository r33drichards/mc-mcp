{{About|the effects caused by the 32-bit float precision loss|other uses|Distance effects}}
{{Exclusive|Bedrock}}
As the player travels far from the world's origin in {{BE}}, things begin to break or the world starts to behave abnormally and become distorted. This is mostly caused by precision loss of the [[w:Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point numbers]] used for location, which dedicates only 23 bits to the fraction; thus, for any position between ''n'' and ''2n'', where n is a power of 2, the precision error makes the world (including blocks and entities) offset by {{frac|''n''|8388608}} blocks, or {{frac|''n''|524288}} block pixels. For example, between X/Z ±16,777,216 and X/Z ±33,554,432, coordinates of all entities are multiples of 2, and only blocks at these coordinates can be rendered; blocks not at these values visually snap to them.

There are a few effects that appear at coordinates other than powers of two, which are shaded in blue on this page. Furthermore, the game defines some intended horizontal and vertical limits for gameplay, such as teleporting being limited to X/Y/Z ±30,000,000. See [[World boundary]] for information on these limits.

== General effects ==
Some effects can occur at any distance but gradually worsen as the coordinates increase. {{BE}} uses 32-bit floating points for many of its calculations, such as the player's position, as opposed to {{JE}}, which uses 64-bit floating points. A 32-bit floating point uses 23 of these bits for precision (the other 9 are used for the sign and the order of magnitude). Thus, there are 2<sup>23</sup> (8,388,608) possible positions for any given order of magnitude. For example, there are 8,388,608 possible positions between 1 and 2, each {{frac|1|8,388,608}} apart, but there are also 8,388,608 possible positions between 8,388,608 and 16,777,216, each a full block apart. In general, between 2<sup>''n''</sup> and 2<sup>''n''+1</sup>, the valid positions are 2<sup>''n''-23</sup> apart. At higher coordinates, the valid positions are farther apart, so the position is less precise. This principle has several implications.

=== Block rendering errors ===
Various blocks are rendered as partial blocks, and the game uses 32-bit floating points to calculate the corners. At high coordinates, these coordinates become offset, causing the block to render incorrectly. Blocks with more detailed models usually become glitched at lower coordinates. A few blocks start to render incorrectly at a relatively low 131,072 blocks, while full blocks continue to render correctly past 8,388,608 blocks up to X/Z ±16,777,216, farther out than most partial blocks.

=== Terrain generation errors ===
Many [[mountain]] biomes gradually stop generating at around X/Z ±2,812,332, replacing by lava lakes. Ancient cities will also be exposed above ground. On Windows, the terrain generation of the [[End]] begins to generate incorrectly beyond X/Z > ±9,991,500 (the exact starting position varies slightly depending on the seed), and the outer islands will be filled to almost solid.

=== Slow movement becomes impossible ===
For an entity to move, it advances a certain distance each tick. At slow speeds or high coordinates, the increase in distance per tick is so little that when rounding to the nearest valid position, the entity is placed at its original position, so it essentially does not move at all. More specifically, between 2<sup>''n''</sup> and 2<sup>''n''+1</sup>, an entity's speed is rounded to the nearest multiple of 20×2<sup>''n''-23</sup>, so it must move at least 10×2<sup>''n''-23</sup> to actually be considered moving.

There are several ways to slow the player's movement, such as [[sneaking]], [[status effect]]s, using an item (e.g. drawing back a [[bow]]), or certain blocks (such as [[cobweb]]s and [[soul sand]]s). In addition, moving diagonally decreases the player's speed on any given axis. This effect can be amplified by moving almost (but not exactly) along an axis, and by walking into an object, one can do this without changing their coordinate on the other axis. Note that due to trigonometric rounding errors,{{verify|Not 100% sure if this is actually what's going on}} extremely small angles do not cause the player to move as slowly as expected. The slowest form of movement without walking into objects ([[sneaking]] through [[cobweb]] over [[blue ice]] with [[Slowness]] VI while touching [[powder snow]] and drawing back a [[bow]]) becomes impossible at 2048 blocks, and coincidentally, the slowest form of movement achievable by walking into an object at a slight angle also becomes impossible at 128 blocks; as a result, both methods must be used to slow the player down if one wishes to observe this effect at lower coordinates.

=== Jitter ===
The game normally runs at 60 frames per second, so when the player moves, the game must calculate the camera position on the intermediate frames between ticks. This is normally not an issue, but if the player is moving close to the slowest possible speed, the camera position on intermediate frames becomes distorted, the game starts to jitter and cause delay movements.

Eventually, the slow speed and precision errors reach a point where the player advances by only one valid position per tick, forcing that the game to render the intermediate frames at exactly the starting or ending position. As a result, the camera moves as though the game ran at 20 frames per second instead of 60.

Since slower speeds become jittery at lower coordinates, it is impossible to say exactly where jitter "starts", as it is an effect that gradually becomes more severe as the player moves further away from the center of the world. However, jittering at regular walking speed becomes obvious at or beyond X/Z ±524,288.

=== Falling through the world ===
At extreme coordinates, small entity hitboxes shrink to a width of 0, and such entities can fall through the edges of solid blocks. For example, if an entity smaller than {{frac|1|4}} blocks exceeds coordinate 2,097,152, its position is rounded to the nearest quarter. Since its hitbox extends less than {{frac|1|8}} from a valid position in each direction, both sides of the hitbox are rounded to the same position, so the apparent hitbox size is 0.

In addition, it is possible to manipulate hitboxes and fall through the world at much lower coordinates. While the positions of the centers of entities are stored in NBT, the positions of the individual hitbox corners are stored in memory. If the player is crossing a power of 2, these corners may move at different speeds, if they are affected differently by floating-point precision errors, thus changing the hitbox size. The hitbox size resets to 0.6 in certain situations, including:{{info needed|Complete list?}}
* Exiting and reloading the world.
* Using the {{cmd|tp}} command.
* Switching between [[walking]], [[sneaking]], [[crawling]], [[swimming]], and [[gliding]] positions.
* Teleporting using [[ender pearl]]s or [[chorus fruit]].
Again, if the player's hitbox size shrinks to 0, it becomes possible to fall through the edges of blocks and into the void.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-39299}}</ref> Conversely, it is possible to stretch one's hitbox to several blocks wide.<ref>{{ytl|q3BvjYdqM0g}}</ref>

* It becomes impossible to walk into an object at a 0.02-degree angle through [[cobweb]] over [[blue ice]] with [[Slowness]] VI (achievable in [[Survival]] mode by using the [[Potion of the Turtle Master|potion of the Turtle Master II]]) while touching [[powder snow]].
** Using the above method of movement at (0,0), it is theoretically possible to fall through the world by crossing the X/Z ±1 limit. However, it is almost impossible to do at these coordinates, as it takes nearly 6 real-life days of non-stop gameplay (where one must start over if they exit the game).

|X/Z ±256 (±2<sup>8</sup>)
|
* Lowest coordinates at which anyone has fallen through the world, although incredibly unlikely at this distance. Since the glitch is caused by hitbox corners affected by different levels of floating point precision errors, it could theoretically happen at X/Z ±1. This is caused by floating point precision errors causing hitboxes of blocks to have small gaps. If any entity's coordinate falls close to an edge of a block, then it will fall through the world and into the void. However, it is theoretically possible to fall through the world at the origin. The precision loss also affects the player's movement speed slightly, although only at extremely low speeds at this distance. However, this would require nearly 6 real-life days of nonstop gameplay (where one must start over if they exit the game). (see above)
* Sneaking on blue ice with cobwebs while touching powder snow and under the effect of Slowness VI while using an item becomes impossible.

* Combining Slowness VI with Speed -4 (achievable only through commands) results in a lower speed that becomes impossible at X/Z ±256.{{verify}}
* Spontaneously falling through the world is now possible from this point on, although extremely unlikely at this distance. This is caused by floating point precision errors causing hitboxes of blocks to have small gaps. If any entity's coordinate falls close to an edge of a block, then it falls through the world and into the void. The precision loss also affects the player's movement speed slightly, although only at extremely low speeds at this distance.

* The walking sound of the player becomes layered and plays fast when walking.
* The player must rejoin the world for the glitch to have an effect. This also applies with the ≈40,960 and ≈44,036 block limitation on the walking sound effect. The coordinates of this glitch depends on what direction you travel in. The flat world preset also has the effect further away. Beyond this point, [[Speed]] IV is required to hear the sound again.
** This happens most likely due to a walking sound precision loss that makes the game not being able to detect where the player is to play the sound at the player's coordinate. Oddly enough, other mobs are unaffected by this bug.

Blocks are rendered based on their corners, whose coordinates are 32-bit floating point numbers. Generally, these are multiples of {{frac|1|16}}. Thus, most blocks render normally as long the floating points are precise to the nearest sixteenth. This breaks at X/Z ±1,048,576 (2<sup>20</sup>), and many partial blocks continue to render incorrectly as the coordinates go even farther out.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-102351||Rendering error beyond X/Z ±1,048,576}}</ref>

When [[RTX]] (ray tracing) is enabled, the lighting is unaffected by floating-point precision errors, even though the block shapes themselves are incorrect.<ref>{{ytl|-CWqHjVdQXo|t=19s}}</ref>

Many commonly-used forms of movement, such as sneaking and walking, becomes difficult or even impossible, with severe jittery. It becomes harder to stand on blocks and easier to fall through the world. In addition, the terrain starts to break down following the table.

* Terrain generation partially breaks down at this point.

These chunks can also be either partially frozen or completely frozen into chunks full of ice depending on their location. They do not generate outside of the terrain-less areas.

* Coordinates of all entities are integers (1 block), meaning that all entities are on the edges of blocks. As a result, most entities less than 1 block wide (including [[player]]s) always fall through blocks, except when using [[Speed]] VIII. The only entities that can stand on blocks from this point onward are [[boat]]s, [[minecart]]s on rails (when placed correctly), [[spider]]s, [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[polar bear]]s, [[ravager]]s, any entities with Speed VIII or higher, and [[panda]]s. The player falls through blocks if the player rides an entity other than the ones described above, uses an ender pearl, gets in [[water]] or [[lava]] or teleports beyond this coordinate.
** If only one coordinate exceeds this value, blocks still have collision detection from the side.
** The player can still be considered "under" blocks, meaning that [[phantom]]s do not spawn. Thus, it is theoretically possible to travel to and from the Stripe Lands in Survival using above-average in speed [[horse]]s.
** A side effect of this is that players will fall into the void infinitely, since the [[Void#Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education|invisible barrier]] at Y=-105 is no longer solid.
* The minimum movement speed is increased to ten blocks per second, meaning that sprinting, boats (except on ice), horses (except for the faster ones mentioned above), and swimming are no longer usable sources as a method of movement.
* To fly in [[Creative]] mode, the player must sprint or look directly along an axis, unless the player position is controlled by 64-bit doubles instead of 32-bit floats. The [[Speed]] effect does not work, due to {{bug|MCPE-61425}}. In addition, flying at this coordinate is bumpy, even when the player is sprinting and looking directly along an axis.
* Most blocks that normally render as partial blocks are either stretched to become full blocks, or squished to become 2-dimensional. The exception is a few blocks that render normally no matter how far out the player travels, such as [[chest]]s, [[bell]]s, [[sign]]s, [[copper golem statue|copper golem statues]], and [[bed]]s.

Here, the rendering fundamentally breaks down to the point where [[blocks]] are no longer visible. The minimum speed for moving gradually increases, up to the point that regular Creative mode flying is no longer possible, and the player is limited to flying with an [[elytra]] and a [[Riptide]] trident, or a glitch where the speed from [[Soul Speed]] is infinitely applied to Creative mode flying.

At extreme coordinates near the integer limit, the game crashes.

* The floating point precision errors cause only blocks with even coordinates not divisible by 4 to render, and are stretched to 2 blocks wide. Blocks at other coordinates are rounded to the nearest multiple of 4 and render 2 dimensional. Blocks render only if they are "exposed" to air or another see-through block. This phenomenon is known as the "Stripe Lands".{{Conjecture|tag=1}} In the "Corner Stripe Lands" where both coordinates exceed this value, blocks with both coordinates 2 mod 4 render double length and double width, blocks with 1 such coordinate render 2D and double length, and blocks with no such coordinate render 1D (thus, the block is completely invisible unless the player is inside it).
** This does not impact the way maps are rendered.
** If the player manages to set their coordinate to an odd number or move into any area not rendered, they get stuck in a glitched position, unable to move the camera view properly, or move in any direction.
* Only [[ghast]]s, large [[slime]]s, and large [[magma cube]]s have collision detection and do not fall through the world.
* The game doesn't recognize that the player is in [[water]] if the player's coordinates are a multiple of 4, causing the player to fall through water and into the [[void]], it is unable to enter [[swimming]], and the fog is black or dark blue. However, water still causes the player to exit [[gliding]], and [[boat]]s still float.
** In the Corner Stripe Lands, water is recognized only if both X and Z coordinates are not a multiple of 4.
* The minimum speed is increased to 20 blocks per second, meaning that it is no longer possible to move using regular Creative mode flight or with [[horse]]s without using [[speed]] effect, leaving only flight by an elytra (either with [[firework rocket]]s or a Riptide trident), a [[horse]] with [[speed]] effect and teleportation by any means.
** Moving using fast Creative mode flight is still possible, but only if the player looks directly into an axis.
* In any biome where multiple blocks can generate as part of the top surface layer, such as [[windswept hills]] and [[old growth taiga]]s, their surfaces become distorted and start to form blocky shapes. The terracotta strata in [[badlands]] biomes have also become further distorted. Because the majority of blocks do not render in the Stripe Lands, this is noticeable only when viewed on a map.
* In ''[[Bedrock Editor]]'', placing objects beyond this point places as stripes.
* If the map is turned on in ''Bedrock Editor'' beyond that point, it matches with stripes.

* Horizontal block rendering stops completely, leaving only vertical block rendering in its place, marking the start of the "Slice Lands".{{conjecture|tag=1}} The floating point precision errors cause only blocks with even coordinates not divisible by 8 to render, and are stretched to 4 blocks wide, marking the start of the. Blocks whose sides are "concealed", such as naturally generated water, are completely invisible.
** At this point, the slices are 4 blocks apart, but the gap widths double for every power of 2.
** It has become difficult to place blocks from this point onward. The player must look at an existing block and extend it along an axis. The only way to generate blocks without external tools is with [[structure block|structure blocks]].
** Past this point, blocks are now completely invisible on a [[flat world]] in some low-end and mid-end devices.
**This is probably due to world does not render anymore.
* Block rendering essentially stops completely, causing the map to be blank from their outward in the Corner Slice Lands;<ref>{{ytl|wurHDkvIKhQ}}</ref> almost all blocks are rendered as one-dimensional, and are therefore impossible to see, although some particles emitted from specific blocks, like torches, could still indicate their presence. Only certain [[block entities]] and any normally visible [[water]] side textures render in this area, which means that, due to the End having no water nor lava, it is almost completely invisible.
* [[Water]] can be viewed only from the side, and becomes completely non-solid.
* The minimum movement speed is increased to 40 blocks per second, meaning that thrown [[ender pearl]]s no longer work. Teleportation is now possible only by chorus fruit because teleportation by commands stops at 30,000,000 blocks. Elytra either require a steep angle or a Riptide trident in [[rain]] to propel the player. Thrown [[trident]]s, [[arrow]]s shot from [[bow]]s or [[crossbow]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are the only other entities that can move horizontally beyond this point, other than the player. Ghasts can no longer move horizontally either, but they do remain airborne without ever falling into the void, while moving vertically.
* To move, the player must glide with elytra at a downward angle of approximately 45 degrees, or use [[Riptide]]. Note that because the player is not considered to be "in water", Riptide can be activated only by rain.
* Another way of moving is by sprint-flying over [[Soul Sand|soul sand]] while wearing [[Soul Speed]] boots in Creative or Spectator mode, which causes the speed boost to be added to the speed of sprint-flying.
* When one uses external tools to teleport past X/Z ±33,554,432, the chunks might not load, meaning that the player becomes immobile and the terrain becomes invisible.{{verify}}
*On some low-end and mid-end devices, the world does not render anymore, and if the player teleports back to X/Z 0, the player can't interact with the world anymore and has to relog. This can be fixed by reloading the world and teleporting back to near X/Z 30,000,000 and teleport back to X/Z 0.
*If the player tries to load into the world on some low-end and mid-end devices, beyond this point, it crashes, which prevents the world from being played on without editing the coordinates of the player or the spawn point with an NBT editor.
* It becomes impossible to shoot any mob.
* [[Phantom]]s can no longer move horizontally.
* In modern versions, if a Riptide trident is used beyond that point, it becomes easy for the player to get stuck, and if the player moves back, they automatically get teleported to this coordinate without using the teleport command.
* The map becomes invisible when the map turns on in the ''Bedrock Editor'' beyond that point.
* In [[Vibrant Visuals]], shadows start to become invisible, because it only left vertical rendering, resulting a shadow loss.

* The minimum movement speed is increased to 80 blocks per second, meaning that thrown [[trident]]s cannot move horizontally and the use of an [[elytra]] requires a [[Riptide]] trident. It is possible to move only when raining.

* All entities are on the edges of chunks.
* The minimum movement speed is increased to 160 blocks per second, meaning that [[arrow]]s shot from [[bow]]s or [[crossbow]]s cannot move horizontally. Riptide I works only if the player looks directly along an axis and does it many times; with Riptide II, the player doesn't have to use it as much to propel. Even ender dragons can no longer move horizontally, but they do remain airborne, similarly to ghasts.
** This is because the ender dragon is 16 blocks in length but the slices are now 16 blocks apart depending on the size.

* Some devices (low and mid-end classes) can no longer survive in this position and frequently crash at this point. If players can successfully go to this coordinate or over, they can survive for few seconds before the game crashes. Therefore, increasing the render distance can crash the game and only mid-high-end and high-end devices can survive at this position.
* The minimum movement speed is increased to 640 blocks per second, meaning that no vanilla methods of movement work anymore, due to {{edition|bedrock}}'s speed limit of 320 blocks per second.

Specifically, the game crashes if the player attempts to load a chunk that is within 64 blocks of this limit of 2 frames, so increasing the render distance can make the rendering limit get closer and crash the game.
* In older versions, teleporting a few blocks just before this limit causes the player to get stuck in a glitched position after a few seconds, being unable to move in any direction (althrough moving the camera is still possible). This happens especially with a high render distance.

== Beyond the 32-bit limit ==
These distances are practically not reachable since the game runs on 32-bit integers, and therefore all effects are theoretical. Every power of two in coordinates, the visual gaps double in width, and the minimum movements speed doubles.

== Stripe Lands ==
[[File:Stripe Lands Swamp.jpg|thumb|197x197px|The "Stripe Lands" at X/Z 16,777,216.]]
[[File:Stripe Lands_0.jpg|thumb|197x197px|Ditto but captured in the new version]]
The "Stripe Lands" are an artifact of the game's rendering and block hitbox calculation, rather than a quirk relating directly to terrain generation.<ref name="StripeLands">{{reddit|name=stripe lands|sub=MCPE|24sshy/no_far_lands_how_about_the_stripe_lands|chah6ah|context=3|MCPE uses single precision (faster and more mobile-friendly), so, sadly, you notice the first jittering around 700k and it's well unplayable around 900k.|mojang_tommo|May 5, 2014}}</ref> The Stripe Lands start at X/Z ±16,777,216. They exist because coordinates are off by up to a full block, causing the blocks themselves (not just their corners) to appear in the wrong places. 

As it can be difficult to use [[Creative]] mode flight to move here, using an elytra propelled with either a [[Riptide]] trident or [[firework rockets]] allows the user to easily move through this region. A [[spear]] enchanted with [[Lunge]] III is very useful for more precise movement, due to it moving the player to the next valid position.

Past X/Z ±33,554,432, all blocks are rendered as two-dimensional, and the gap between valid blocks doubles to 1 out of four, which makes horizontal block rendering stop completely, marking the "Slice Lands". This gap doubles again at every power of 2 and reaches 128 blocks wide at X/Z: ±1,073,741,824. This is the widest the gaps can be since the game crashes near X/Z: ±2,147,483,648 (Unless it uses 64-bit and 128-bit devices).

*Jumping while wearing elytra and having slow falling.

Like the X and Z axis, the game breaks at excessive Y coordinates. Since blocks cannot be placed at [[altitude]]s higher than Y=128 in the Nether and the End, or Y=320 in the Overworld, block rendering glitches do not occur, but many forms of vertical entity movement become impossible and other effects do.

Vertical effects are not encounterable in the Nether or the [[void]] below any dimension in [[Survival]] mode, because a [[bedrock]] barrier prevents all entities from entering the void without using [[Tutorial:The Void|glitches]]. Furthermore, a barrier from [[invisible bedrock]] stops all entities at Y=-40 in the Nether and the End or Y=-104 in the Overworld, while taking {{hp|4}} damage every half second (except players in [[Creative]] mode). Beyond this entities can move only vertically using the "fall through the world" glitch past ±8,388,608, or teleporting below the barrier.

* [[Phantom]]s can no longer swoop up or down at the player.
* It becomes impossible for [[Sand]], [[gravel]] and dropped items to fall.
* Flying upward with [[elytra]] and [[firework rocket]]s becomes impossible.
* [[Snow]] particles become suspended in the air.
|-
|Y ±67,108,864
|
* Falling becomes impossible.
* Projectiles falling down becomes impossible.
* in 3rd person the player can look only horizontal or vertical.
* Floating with Levitation 88 and lower becomes impossible.{{verify|Do higher levels allow entities to float beyond this height?}}
* Flying upward with [[elytra]] and jump button in Creative becomes impossible.
|-
|Y ±134,217,728
|
* Floating with Levitation 177 and lower becomes impossible.
* It becomes impossible to look up or down in 3rd person.
|-
|Y ±268,435,456
|
* Floating with any Levitation level like 255 becomes impossible since 255 is the maximum vanilla level possible.
|-
|Y ±536,870,912
|
* Some devices (low and mid-end classes) can no longer survive in this position and frequently crash at this point. If players can successfully go to this coordinate or over, they can survive for few seconds before the game crashes. Therefore, increasing the render distance can crash the game and only high-end devices can survive at this position.
|-
|Y ±1,073,741,824
|
* Could crash beyond this point on some lower end devices.
|-
|Y ±2,147,483,647
|
* The game crashes near these coordinates on 32-bit devices (see above), although, since the position is 64-bit, there can be a few rendered frames left before it crashes when the player teleports here.
|-
|Y ±9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (±2<sup>63</sup> – 1)
|
* The game, assuming it were patched to use 64-bit doubles, would crash near this point while using 64-bit systems, as this is above the maximum value for a signed 64-bit binary integer in [[w:C++|C++]]. Also, the game would also crash if the player attempts to load a chunk beyond this coordinate, so increasing the render distance can make the rendering limit get closer, resulting again in a crash.{{verify}}
|-
| style="color: #222222; background: #dddddd" | Y ~3.4028237e+38 or ±3.40x10^38 (2<sup>128</sup>)
|
* The maximum 32-bit floating-point integer {{in|be}} and [[w:C++|C++]]. Beyond this point, just like with the limit of the 32-bit float at around 3.4028237e+38 in the X/Z axis, it is excepted that the player's coordinates would also roll over to read "Infinity", as the 32-bit floating point precision has run out of bits to represent coordinate data. It's impossible to go further than this point, as a value of "Infinity" would break rendering code in ''Bedrock Edition''. It is even likely that this could also overflow to read "NaN" (not a number) or a null value, which, again, would break rendering code and result in unpredictable behavior, such as visual glitches, invalid positioning, and even the game crashing as a result.{{verify}}
|-
| style="color: #ffffff; background: #000000" | Y ±~1.7976931e+308 (2<sup>1024</sup>)
|
* The maximum patched 64-bit floating-point integer {{in|be}} and [[w:C++|C++]], comparable to {{JE}}. Beyond this point, just like with the limit of the 32-bit float at around 3.4028237e+38 in the X/Z axis or the limit of the 64-bit double in the X/Z axis, it is excepted that the player's coordinates would also roll over to read "Infinity", assuming it were patched to use 64-bit doubles, as the 64-bit double precision has run out of bits to represent coordinate data. It's impossible to go further than this point, as a value of "Infinity" would break rendering code in ''Bedrock Edition''.
