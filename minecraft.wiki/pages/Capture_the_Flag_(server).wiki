}}'''Capture the Flag''' was a [[Server#Minigame|minigame]] [[event server]] hosted by [[Mojang Studios]] and the first to be introduced as a [[featured server]]. It featured a traditional [[w:Capture the flag#Software and games|capture the flag]] minigame, where players were able to compete with a team, capture the opposing team's flag, and defend their own. Players could also get the [[#Reward|Flag Runner Headband]] redeemed for 250 gems; an in game currency that was earned by winning a game or killing a [[player]].

It was apparently brought back briefly on August 22nd, but there is little information about this, and no confirmation that it actually happened.<ref>[[Talk:Capture the Flag (server)#c-Amethyst hhh-20250903170300-FeedbackBot-20250822150700]]</ref>

The server was brought back online again starting on September 30th, 2025, and lasted until October 6th, 2025, at approximately 6:40 PM CST. There have been issues where the server would sometimes not show up in the featured servers list.

== Gameplay ==
=== Playing field ===
[[File:Capture the Flag first person bow drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing a bow at an opponent.]]
When [[player]]s join a match, they're randomly assigned to the red or blue team. Each player starts at their team's [[spawn point]], equipped with a [[bow]] and [[arrow]], and have three [[Health|hearts]]. Their main objective is to capture the opposing team's flag while defending their own, and winning the game by reaching the highest captured flag score for their team.

Players can deal one heart of [[damage]] to other opponents by shooting them with the bow. Upon killing one, they are rewarded with 5 gems. They are able to hit each other by [[melee attack]], but doesn't deal any damage.

The [[hotbar]] is noticeably gone, but players can still select other items using the mouse scroll wheel. The player's current statistic is shown on the top right of the screen, with the icons from top to bottom showing their earned gems, kills, deaths, and captured flag score. The player's current hearts is shown above the usual hotbar placement; other players' current hearts are also shown above their [[username]]s.

Each team's flag is located near its own spawn point. When a player captures a flag, they must return it to their own team's flag to score a point for their team. A noticeable speed decrease is applied while moving with a captured flag.

=== Post game ===
[[File:Capture the Flag post game screen.png|thumb|right|Post game screen showing the player's statistics.]]
The game tracks the scores for each team after capturing a flag in the [[scoreboard]], and displayed on the sidebar. The first team to reach the maximum score wins the match, with the winning team's players receive the highest gems reward, while the losing team gets fewer. The numbers of maximum score and gems rewarded varies depending on the map:
* Arena has 3 captured flag and 50 gems reward for the winning team, while the losing team gets 25 gems.
* Castle has 20 captured flag and 100 gems reward for the winning team, while the losing team gets 50 gems.

A ''post game'' screen is displayed, showing the player's match statistics, such as their kills, deaths, K/D ratio (kill/death ratio), flag captures, and gems earned. Players can play a new match or return to the hub from the screen.

== Places ==
{{expand section}}

=== Central Tower ===
Players spawn inside of a large, [[Polished Blackstone Bricks|blackstone]] castle within the Crimson Ruins. Behind the spawn area is a curious installment made up of [[chiseled stone]], [[crying obsidian]], and [[froglights]], with a blue [[parrot]] dancing inside. Walking down a stairway of stone brick slabs, the player can pass by large tapestries and boilers of lava, exiting out either a giant door under a [[stained glass]] window or two detours lined with [[Nether Bricks|nether brick]] floors and [[lanterns]]. Outside the castle is an [[NPC]], the Macaw Guardian, with two [[written book]]s on [[lectern]]s which tell the story of a conflict happening in the game world. When interacting with the NPC, they are able to choose from two maps: Arena and Castle.

Behind all that is a small drawbridge made of [[chiseled nether bricks]], [[Blackstone Wall|blackstone]], and [[Resin Brick Wall|resin bricks]], where a view can be seen of the towers. On a few spots of the bridge are [[Magma Block|magma blocks]] which can kill the player. Right of this area and left of the gate is a series of [[Red Nether Brick Slab|red nether brick slabs]], serving as a parkour challenge. Climbing up these will lead the player up to a balcony above the spawn area, underneath the window, before leading to a narrow strip of slabs ending on a [[ladder]].

=== Arena ===
An small map consists of the two blue and red sides opposing each other. Each side has a castle where the team's flag and spawn point are located. Players can climb on top of the castle to see the entire arena. On the front, there are pillars on each side which players can climb through the [[vines]]. The playing field has a tall tower on the center of the map. There are hallways in the edges around the playing field; they can be accessed from each team's castle, or entrances between the tall tower.

=== Castle ===
[[File:Capture the Flag heart of dark castle.jpg|thumb|right|The Volcano Heart leaking out lava inside the dark castle.]]
A massive map with a prominent dark stone castle stands at the map's center, with the inside hides the '''Volcano Heart''', what it looks like leaking out [[lava]] fluids to the ground floor made out of [[deepslate]] materials. The top of the heart features [[slime block]]s (covered by [[carpet]]s) which players can bounce off from the rooftop of the dark castle. The outside walls of the dark castle being mixed of [[deepslate bricks|deepslate]] and [[stone brick]]s.

There are four '''Elemental Towers''' built around the dark castle:{{note|These are unofficial names, as they are unnamed in the game itself.}}
* '''Ice tower''' which features cold and snowy environment, with multiple tall, slender towers and spires and a tower with a large, arched doorway. It is built with [[snow block]]s, light [[concrete]]s, [[prismarine]]s, and other blocks with various shades of light blue, white, and a greenish-teal, giving it a very cool and pristine appearance. It is used as the blue team's spawn point, as well the team's flag.
* '''Nether tower''' which features [[The Nether|hell-like environment]], with numerous tall, [[huge crimson fungus]] that are scattered across the landscape. The primary entrance to the tower is framed by [[nether bricks]] and has glowing [[shroomlight]]s, leading into the base with invasive [[Huge warped fungus|warped]] and crimson fungus. It is used as the red team's spawn point, as well the team's flag.
* '''Desert tower''' which features [[Desert|sandy terrain]], with multiple [[cactus]] and [[dry grass]]es spreading the landscape. There is a [[savanna]] area with a pond which resembles an {{w|oasis}}. The tower primarily made of [[sandstone]]s and many of its [[red sandstone|variants]]. A [[dried ghast]] can be seen near the dark castle, which shows the harsh environment of the desert.
* '''Bamboo tower''' which features green and lush environment, with variation of [[Oak tree|oak]] and [[jungle tree]]s on the terrain. The tower looks overgrown with [[vine]]s and other vegetation, with the base building primarily made of out [[bamboo block]]s and the outside pathway to the dark castle with [[mud brick]]s.

Each of them have a bridge connecting to the fortified open-air bastion of the dark castle.

== Reward ==
Players that earned 250 gems from playing CTF can redeem them at the [[NPC|Macaw Guardian]] to gain the Flag Runner Headband as a [[Character Creator]] item. A Blue headband was given out on 8/4/25 to those who already claimed Red.

Hanging Island Tournament

by Macaw Guardian

'''Page 2 of 10'''

Welcome to Crimson Ruins, Adventurer!

From here, you can take part in the tournament on the Hanging Island.

"Why take part", you ask?

'''Page 3 of 10'''

The gates have to be held to launch the Volcano Heart - long ago moved away from the core by unknown forces.

It hovers in the middle of the island, beating, pumping lava into the molten basin of the Great Macaw Mountain.

'''Page 4 of 10'''

Central Tower has been built around it, likely to protect or harness it.

Judging by the state of the towers, the experiments have not gone well.

The exact origin of the Elemental Towers is shrouded in mystery.

'''Page 5 of 10'''

The remaining records found in the Crimson Ruins state only that the games MUST take place or the volcano is going to erupt.

While the mountain was presumed dormant, fields and cities have formed around the fertile soil.

Eruption threatens to destroy all that. If the games fail, it *will* destroy your home.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>You* can change that.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>You* have a chance to become part of history.

Join forces with others in battle for the future of this land!

Good luck and thank you, Adventurer!

== Trivia ==
* The "Flag Runner Headband" was originally called "Faster than Lightning" before being renamed.
* The spawn hub uses the same map as Castle being in the [[nighttime]]; the Central Tower where the player spawn can be seen on the background behind the ice tower.
** There is text word on the [[sky]] written "MADE WITH EDITOR", suggesting the map was made with [[Bedrock Editor]].
** Players can go out of bound from the Crimson Ruins by jumping at the top right corner of the bridge near the Macaw Guardian. This makes the entire Castle map accessible in the nighttime.
