* [[Spectator]] Mode has been accidentally included as an available [[Game mode|game mode]].
* Some functions while coding in Python Notebooks will result in a Syntax Error: Unexpected 0 error message.
* The [[How to play]] Guide has references to some features, like [[Realms]], that only exist in {{BE}}. Those features are not included in ''Minecraft'' Education and the guides will be updated soon for the features in ''Minecraft Education''.
* Due to the new changes to how worlds are loaded, Some users may experience immediate crashes moments after loading into a world if IPv4 support isn't detected. This mandates that the user must have IPv4 enabled on their host operating system.
