'''The Enderall''' is a large hostile [[enderman]]-like creature with an "[[The End|otherworldly]] origin"<ref name="origin" /> that appeared as a skin in the [[Campfire Tales]] [[skin pack]].

== Biography ==
The two teams of a reality game show make their way to [[Scatter Island]], which is home to numerous [[Enderman|endermen]], and are informed that they have to kill the endermen and collect ten of their ender pearls. After this is done, the host declares that only they can say who won and unleashes The Enderall from behind a wall of stone. The Enderall reveals its threat by sucking up an enderman. Team Stone Beach then goes up against it, and come out victorious, win the challenge, and are rewarded with two bread, two pumpkin pie, and two cooked chicken, which they split upon the remaining teams. This sharing becomes upsetting to the host.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Enderall has teleporting abilities like an [[Enderman#Behavior|enderman]], along with the ability to suction [[mob]]s, [[item]]s, and lightweight [[block]]s (such as [[ladder]]s) into its portal-like mouth. It can also launch blocks or items it sucked in back out as a ranged attack. It has a purple weak spot on its back and drops many [[ender pearl]]s when killed. The Enderall can be seen killing endermen, showing that it’s hostile even to other related mobs, similar to a [[zoglin]].
