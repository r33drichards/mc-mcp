'''Water''' is a [[fluid]] that naturally generates abundantly in the [[Overworld]].

== Obtaining ==
Water can be collected by using a [[bucket]] on a water source block or a full water [[cauldron]], creating a [[water bucket]].

{{IN|JE}}, water does not have a direct item form, but {{in|be}} it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing or add-ons.

=== Natural generation ===
Water naturally generates in the [[Overworld]] to form [[ocean]]s, [[river]]s and [[spring]]s. The water level is at [[altitude|layer 62]] near oceans and rivers, but changes depending on location due to the [[aquifer]] system, filling some carvers, noise caves and canyons with water at different levels. Water also generates as small puddles on the floor next to [[dripstone cluster]]s, and as clay pools on the floor of [[lush caves]].

Water also generates in [[village]]s, [[desert well]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[woodland mansion]]s, [[ancient cities]], [[ocean monument]]s and [[trial chambers]] within various rooms.

Water never generates in [[the Nether]] and instantly disappears if placed there with a water bucket. However, water can exist in the Nether in a [[cauldron]]. Water can also be placed in the Nether using [[commands]] such as {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}}. Although it does not naturally generate there, water can be placed and functions normally in [[the End]].

{{IN|be}}, water also generates as part of [[ocean ruins]] with loot [[chest]]s, but only two water blocks generate: 
* One water block generates inside the loot chest, making it a [[waterlogged]] loot chest.
* The other water block generates on top of the loot chest.
These water blocks generate even if the ruin is located on the surface.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-36793|||CR}}</ref> This is not the case in {{el|je}}; if an underwater ruin generates on the surface, no water generates.<ref>{{bug|MC-136156}}</ref> This also happens with [[shipwreck]]s.

Water spends most of its time as stationary, rather than flowing – regardless of its level, or whether it contains a current downward or to the side. When specifically triggered by a block update, water changes to 'flowing', updates its level, then changes back to stationary. Water springs are generated as flowing, and oceans, and rivers are generated as stationary. This happens before most types of generated structure are created, and the main cause of water "glitches" is that generated structures do not trigger a block update to let water flow into them.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
Using a [[water bucket]] or a [[bucket of aquatic mob]] creates water (except in [[the Nether]]).

[[Ice]] and [[frosted ice]] blocks under brighter light levels melt into water source blocks (except in [[the Nether]]). Ice and frosted ice also create water when broken, but only if there is a movement-blocking block or fluid under it.

== Usage ==
=== Swimming ===
{{main|Swimming}}

The button for {{control|swim|text=swimming}} is the same as the button for jumping; non-swimming players and mobs sink slowly in water. Holding the swim button raises the player through the water, and when the surface is reached, the player bobs up and down. The {{control|crouch}} button can be used to sink faster. The {{control|sprint}} button can be used to put the player in "swim mode" when the player is completely submerged in water. When in swim mode, the player is horizontal and one block high. The player has an arm-waving animation when viewed in third person or by other players.

Swimming in water is considerably slower against currents (see [[#Current|Current]] below), but faster when going with the current.

Most mobs that can stand can also swim any time they are in water, except for [[iron golem]]s, [[piglin]]s, [[hoglin]]s, [[strider]]s, [[piglin brute]]s and undead mobs. This can lead to drowning if the water is falling from above.

Water of any depth prevents any entity, including the player, from sustaining falling damage if they fall into it, regardless of the distance fallen.

Being inside of water also imparts a [[fog]] effect, tinted accordingly.

==== Water movement efficiency ====
Water movement efficiency is an attribute that affects movement speed when in contact with water. With the [[Depth Strider]] enchantment, water movement efficiency is increased by ⅓, including reducing the speed at which flowing water pushes the player when standing still.

=== Spreading ===
{{Main|Fluid#Spread}}
[[File:Water spread v1-13.png|300px|right|An image showing water's spreading distance]]
Water spreads horizontally and downward into nearby [[air]] blocks. Water can spread downward infinitely until stopped by a block, and 7 blocks horizontally from a source block on a flat surface. Water spreads at a rate of 1 block every 5 game ticks, or 4 blocks per second.

When spreading horizontally, a weight is assigned to every direction water can flow. For each direction, this weight is initially set to 1000. Then, for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. Finally, water spreads in the directions with the lowest flow weight.

Spreading water extinguishes [[fire]] and washes away certain types of items or placed blocks, causing them to drop as items and then carrying them along in the flow until the edge of the spread. Affected items include [[plant]]s (except trees), [[snow]], [[torch]]es, [[carpet]]s, [[redstone dust]] and some other redstone components, [[cobweb]], [[end rod]]s, [[head]]s, and [[flower pot]]s.

=== Source blocks ===
{{anchor|Water Spawner}} <!-- Compatibility anchor -->
{{about|the behavior and creation of source units of water|the removed block that created water sources|Water Spawner|section=1}}
A water source block is created from a flowing block that is horizontally adjacent to two or more other source blocks, and sitting on top of a solid block or another water source block. This allows water spawners to exist, in which a new source block immediately forms in the space left by removing a source block with a [[bucket]]. Pools of still water can be created by placing water source blocks in a confined area.

Water spawners can be constructed by arranging for two source blocks to flow into a third block. Each of the examples below require two source blocks, each on opposite ends of the hole, to create a renewable water source block in between.

While water source blocks generate only adjacent to solid blocks, they do not require a solid block to support them. Removing all adjacent blocks to a water source block causes it to remain floating in the air.

A water source block can also be created from a flowing block that is adjacent to one source block horizontally and one vertically above the flowing block. 

{{IN|java}}, the formation of new water sources blocks can be disabled when the [[game rule]] {{cd|waterSourceConversion}} is set to {{cd|false}}.

3x1 water source.png|3×1 water spawner (middle water block is renewable)

</gallery>

A [[dispenser]] loaded with a filled [[bucket]] places a water source block in an empty block in front of it when activated. A dispenser loaded with an empty bucket and a water source right in front of it sucks the source into the bucket when activated.

In snowy [[biome]]s, water source blocks have a chance to turn into [[ice]] if directly under the sky. Ice blocks under brighter light levels melt back into water source blocks (except in [[the Nether]]). Ice reverts to water when broken, but only if there is a movement-blocking block or any fluid under it.

The spreading of water sources can be simulated using the plugin below:

</div>

=== Current ===
The current in a water block determines both the direction it appears to flow and the direction an [[entity]] such as a player or [[boat]] is pushed from that block.

Water with a current pushes players and [[mob]]s at a speed of about 1.39 meters per second, or 25 blocks every 18 seconds. Players that are flying in creative mode do not get pushed.

The horizontal current in a water block is based on a vector sum of the flows to and from that block from its four horizontal neighbors. For example, if a block receives water from the north and sends it both south and east, but borders a solid block on its west edge, then a south-southeast current exits from that block, because 2 southward flows (in and out) are combined with 1 eastward flow (out). Thus, 16 horizontal directions are possible. If a branch in a channel is 2 blocks wide at its entrance, then entities float into it rather than continuing in a straight line.

[[File:Water flow with motion blocking.jpg|thumb|The upper water source block flows toward the bottom-left source block, but not the bottom-right, because [[glass]] [[blocks motion]] but [[ladder]]s do not.]]

Normally, a water source block cannot have horizontal current unless it is actually able to flow into a neighboring block. However, a contained source block ''can'' have current toward a lower source block if the block that prevents its flow is not [[motion-blocking]] (see image).

Water blocks can create a downward current. A downward current in a water block is caused by the block below it. Most blocks that do not have a solid upper face cause downward current on above water blocks. Also, ice and falling water blocks (blocks created by spreading downward) cause downward current on the water block above. Falling water blocks have a downward current by default.

It is also possible for the water current to create horizontal directions beyond the possible 16 directions (i.e. cardinal directions that are multiples of 22.5 degrees) via falling current (typically the 32-direction "{{w|Cardinal direction|tertiary intercardinal direction}}" using directions bisecting the angle between the points on the 16-direction {{w|points of the compass}}, where the intermediate cardinal directions are multiples of 11.25 degrees but not multiples of 22.5 degrees, and rarely the 64-direction points). For instance, if a water block receives water from the north and sends downwards before flowing further to the west and borders a solid block on its east edge below the falling current, if the falling current that sends to the west is not obstructed by a solid block in that particular direction, then the falling current would be displayed as west by north (281.25 degrees clockwise, where 0 degrees indicates north), but the actual movement of the entity will not match the flowing direction and will remain westward. On the other hand, if a water block receives water from the north and sends downwards before flowing further both north and west, and borders a solid block on its east edge, then the northwest by north (326.25 degrees clockwise) falling current exits before the adjacent water blocks below it, and the entity movement direction would match the flowing direction instead.

=== Light ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, every block of water reduces [[light]] by 1 extra level (in addition to the normal fading-out of light). {{IN|java}}, water does not cause any additional decrease for block light, but diffuses sky light, causing the light to fade with depth.

===Water and lava===
{{Main|Fluid#Mixing}}

Water and lava can produce [[stone]], [[cobblestone]], or [[obsidian]] based on how they interact. If water touches a lava source, the lava source turns to obsidian. If both touch each other while flowing, cobblestone is made and no sources are removed, and if lava flows downward onto water, the water turns to stone.

=== Interactions with mobs ===
==== Direct contact ====

Water damages [[endermen]], [[snow golem]]s, [[strider]]s and [[blaze]]s, at a rate of {{hp|1}} per half second. If water comes into contact with a [[shulker]] or an [[enderman]], the mob teleports away.

==== Drowning ====
{{Main|Damage#Drowning}}

Players and mobs (except [[aquatic mob]]s, [[undead mob]]s and [[iron golem]]s) have a breath meter that lasts 15 seconds. After they run out of breath, they take {{hp|2}} drowning damage every second until they die, surface, or enter [[bubble column]]s.

[[Dolphin]]s are a special case when it comes to drowning: they take drowning damage when underwater for about 4 minutes, but also take suffocation damage when in air for about 2 minutes.

If a [[husk]] drowns underwater, it starts to shake and eventually becomes a [[zombie]]. If a [[zombie]] drowns underwater, it starts to shake and eventually transforms into a [[drowned]].

===== Oxygen bonus =====
Each level of the [[Respiration]] enchantment grants an oxygen bonus of +1, which equates to 15 seconds to the breath meter, and grants an x/(x+1) chance (where x is the Respiration level) of not taking drowning damage after that time: 30 seconds and an average {{hp|1}}/second with Respiration I, 45 seconds and an average of {{frac|2|3}} damage/second with Respiration II, and 60 seconds and an average of {{frac|1|2}} damage/second with Respiration III.

=== Submerged mining speed ===
Players with their head underwater require 5 times the normal amount of time to mine blocks while standing on the ground, or 25 times while not on the ground. If a player wears a helmet with the [[Aqua Affinity]] enchantment, submerged mining speed is increased by 400%, negating this effect. Mining is still 5 times slower if not standing on the ground.

=== Explosions ===
Water does not prevent explosions from activating. Water has a high blast resistance, causing it to absorb any normal blasts, with the exception of explosions from [[underwater TNT]]{{only|education}} or placing a [[Falling Block|falling block]] on top of a regular TNT block and then lighting it.

=== Hardening concrete powder ===
When water comes into contact with [[concrete powder]], the powder hardens into solid [[concrete]].

=== Sponges ===
When a dry [[sponge]] comes into contact with a water source or flowing block, it becomes a wet [[sponge]], absorbing all water within 3 to 5 blocks in all directions. [[Kelp]] and [[lily pad]]s within the absorbed water blocks are destroyed and drop as items, and [[seagrass]] is destroyed without dropping anything. Mobs that take damage out of water are affected as a side-effect. 

Sponges do not absorb water from [[waterlogged]] blocks, nor water that comes into contact by flowing back in from outside the area of absorption. For instance, placing a sponge 4 or more blocks from a single water source removes the flowing water in the area of effect, but as the flow from the source resumes it is not affected by the wet sponge.

A sponge instantly absorbs nearby water when it is placed next to water or when water comes into contact with it (by being placed next to the sponge, or by flowing toward it). A sponge absorbs [[water]] around itself (water source blocks or flowing water) out to a [[taxicab distance]] of 7 in all directions (including up and down), but won't absorb more than 65 blocks of water (water closest to the sponge is absorbed first). The absorption propagates only from water to water and does not "jump over" non-water blocks (including air).

=== Dripping ===
[[File:WaterDropletsExample.png|thumb|Dripping water.]]
Water above a non-transparent block (except for stairs, fences, or slabs) produces dripping particles on the underside of that block. If a block of [[pointed dripstone]] hangs under any block directly beneath a water source, the drips can slowly fill up a [[cauldron]] placed underneath. Without the dripstone, a cauldron does not fill.

=== Vertical transport ===
[[Bubble column]]s are created by placing [[magma block]]s or [[soul sand]] under water. The latter can be used to transport [[mobs]] or items quickly vertically.

=== Irrigation ===
Water irrigates all [[farmland]] within a distance of 4 blocks in every direction except upwards, which causes crops on the farmland to grow faster and prevents the farmland from randomly reverting to [[dirt]]. [[Sugar cane]] also requires water next to the block it is planted on to be placed, and breaks if it detects this is no longer the case. [[Lily pad]]s can be placed only on water source blocks, and [[seagrass]] and [[kelp]] can exist only inside of water source blocks. [[Coral]] also must be in contact with water to survive.

=== Appearance ===
Water uses a translucent animated texture that is tinted differently in different [[biomes]]. {{IN|Java}}, water in cauldrons is completely opaque.<ref>{{bug|MC-13187}}</ref>

Unlike other translucent blocks such as [[ice]], [[stained glass]] and [[tinted glass]], water shows the opposite sides of its external planes when viewed from within and from outside.<ref>{{bug|MC-202578|||WAI}}</ref> However, it applies only to the top plane and four side planes; the bottom face is always unseen from above.<ref>{{bug|MC-190053}}</ref>

==== Fog ====
When the camera is inside water, a special [[fog]] effect is applied. Initially, this fog is very dense and blocks almost 100% of the view, but it gradually changes to a static fog distance during 30 seconds. The color and view distance are dependent of the biome. The [[Night Vision]] and [[Conduit Power]] effects increase underwater visibility.

==== Vibrant Visuals ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals ocean reflections.png|thumb|Water with Vibrant Visuals, showing different types of reflections, transparency, and the blue color caused by scattering.]]
[[File:Vibrant Visuals water caustics.png|thumb|Water caustics in a [[desert]].]]
[[File:Vibrant Visuals underwater lighting.png|thumb|Fog and light shafts underwater.]]
When [[Vibrant Visuals]] is enabled, the graphics of water are greatly enhanced with various effects. The biome colors are not visible, but the surface is transparent. Deeper bodies of water create a blue tint on all objects, while single blocks of water appear almost invisible. When a surface underwater is hit by directional lighting (such as the [[sun]] and [[moon]]), animated and pixelated caustics are projected on the textures. Shadows can also be projected on water surfaces, but not underwater. Instead, the lack of caustics where normal shadows would render when directional lighting is being blocked, can be seen as shadows.

Unlike any other block, the water's surface can perfectly reflect all objects. Light sources, both emissive and directional, create glowing reflections. Reflections are only visible for objects currently rendered on the screen, except for [[clouds]] which are always rendered.

Volumetric [[fog]] is applied underwater, on top of the regular biome fog which is less visible. This greatly affects how light behaves underwater, with much more scattering and light shafts, and glowing fog effects around light sources.

Value 0 is used for water source blocks. Values from 1 to 7 are reversed compared to fluidstate level values: for example, a water block with a level 1 fluidstate will have a level 7 blockstate, a water block with a level 2 fluidstate will have a level 6 blockstate, and so on. Value 8 matches its fluidstate counterpart. Values above 8 can only be obtained with commands. For more informations about how water spreads, see [[fluid#Level]].|foot=1}}

|0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15|
If bit 0x8 is set, this fluid is "falling" and spreads only downward. At this level, the lower bits are essentially ignored, since this block is then at its highest fluid level. This level is equal to the falling water above, equal to 8 plus the level of the non-falling water above it.

The lower three bits are the fluid block's level. 0 is the highest fluid level (not necessarily filling the block - this depends on the neighboring fluid blocks above each upper corner of the block). Data values increase as the fluid level of the block drops: 1 is the next highest, 2 lower, on through 7, the lowest fluid level. Along a line on a flat plane, water drops one level per meter.|foot=1}}

==Issues==
{{Issue list}}

==Trivia==
*The texture subtly overlaid on the screen when underwater is that of the original water texture from 0.0.12a.
**The outdatedness of this texture is not considered a bug or oversight, unlike many other outdated textures.<ref>{{bug|MC-241000|||Invalid}}</ref>
**This texture is particularly difficult to notice due to its extreme transparency,<ref>{{bug|MC-128337}}</ref> as well as the fact that other blocks likely make the scene visually noisy enough to further obscure it under most conditions.
* While underwater, the player's FOV (field of vision) is lowered by 10 to simulate light {{w|refraction}}. This can be disabled via the "FOV Effects" [[option]].
*If a player or mob with the [[Levitation]] effect touches water, the effect is completely negated.<ref>{{bug|MC-83369}}</ref>
