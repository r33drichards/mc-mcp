** {{nbt|boolean|HasBeenShot}}: {{cd|1}} or {{cd|0}} ({{cd|true}}/{{cd|false}}) - If {{cd|true}}, this projectile has existed for at least one tick. This is used by the game to ensure that it only triggers the projectile_shoot [[game event]] once.
** {{nbt|boolean|LeftOwner}}: {{cd|1}} or {{cd|0}} ({{cd|true}}/{{cd|false}}) - If {{cd|true}}, this projectile has escaped its owner's hitbox for the first time and can now collide with entities. Not present when false.
** {{nbt|int-array|Owner}}: The [[UUID]] of the entity this projectile was thrown by, stored as four ints. May not exist.
