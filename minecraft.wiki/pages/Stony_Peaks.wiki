'''Stony peaks''' are warmer [[mountain]] peak biomes completely made out of [[stone]] and [[calcite]] strips.

== Description ==
Stony peaks are a warmer variation of both the [[jagged peaks]] and the [[frozen peaks]] biomes that generates when a mountain peak is in the lukewarm biome temperature range. It generates in [[savanna]]s, some [[forest]]s, some [[plains]], and [[jungle]]s, and it doesn't generate [[snowy slopes]], [[grove]]s, [[meadows]] or [[cherry grove]]s in the slopes of the [[mountain]], instead, [[savanna plateau]]s, [[forest]]s, and [[jungle]]s often generate around it. It is mainly covered by stone with large [[strip]]s of [[calcite]] and exposed ores, making it the only biome where calcite generates above ground.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], stony peaks use warmish atmospherics, lighting, and color grading similar to [[jungles]], although they use default volumetric [[fog]].

Stony peaks are the third rarest Overworld biome and the rarest mountain biome, making up around 0.1% of the Overworld by area.
