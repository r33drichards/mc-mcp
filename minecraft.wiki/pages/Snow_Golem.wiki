A '''snow golem''' is a buildable [[passive mob]] that throws [[snowball]]s at monsters, which provokes them into attacking it. Depending on the [[biome temperature]], it also either produces a trail of [[snow]] or takes heat [[damage]] and dies.

== Creation ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Snow golems}}
{{FakeImage|align=none|style=display:block;float:right;margin:0 1em 1em 0;|image-style=background:#222;border:2px solid black|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Carved Pumpkin|s=Snow Block| p | s | s }}|Snow golem build configuration. [[Jack o'lantern]]s can also be used.}}
Snow golems are created by stacking two [[snow block]]s vertically, and then placing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]] on top of the stack. The pumpkin may be placed by the [[player]], a [[dispenser]], or an [[enderman]].<ref>{{Reddit2|sub=Minecraft|id=korjk|author=CHLGV|date=September 23, 2011|text=Endermen can make snow golems.}}</ref> Snow golems cannot be made by [[piston]]s. The building pattern also works when arranged sideways or upside-down, as long as the pumpkin is the last block placed. 

The snow golem spawns at the location of the [[snow block]] as its feet when created horizontally.

== Drops ==
=== Sheared ===
A snow golem drops 1 {{BlockLink|Carved Pumpkin|carved pumpkin}} when sheared.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Snow golem attacking a witch.png|thumb|Snow golems search for the nearest monster and attack it.]]
{{see also|Tutorial:Snow farming}}
[[File:A snow golem's range.png|thumb|The golem can hit an entity when:

* it is anywhere on the block '''(green),'''
* it is not pushed furthest away from the golem '''(yellow),'''
* it is pushed furthest towards the golem '''(orange)'''.
* The golem can not hit entities on '''red''' or other further away blocks 

]]
Snow golems wander aimlessly and try to avoid [[water]], obstacles, and environmental hazards, but are immune to damage from [[powder snow]]. They are also immune to [[fall damage]].

Snow golems take {{Hp|1}} damage per tick when in contact with [[rain]] or water and in [[biome]]s with a [[Biome#List of biome climates|temperature]] greater than 1.0. Examples include [[savanna]]s,{{only|java}} [[badlands]], [[desert]]s, and biomes in [[the Nether]]. The [[Fire Resistance]] [[effect]] allows them to survive in these biomes.

[[File:Snow Golem Stats.png|thumb|Snow golem biome statistics.]]

As a snow golem moves, it leaves a trail of [[snow]] on the ground if the blocks can support it<ref name="SnowGolemTrail">{{Tweet|notch|116449906658516992|Also, they spread snow by walking around. Nice.|September 21, 2011}}</ref>. {{IN|java}}, this happens in any biome. {{IN|bedrock}}, however, the snow trail is not generated in biomes with a high temperature value; examples include [[jungle]]s, [[mushroom field]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[stony peaks]], [[desert]]s, [[badlands]], and biomes in [[the Nether]]. If the <code>mobGriefing</code> [[game rule]] is <code>false</code>, the snow trail does not appear.

[[File:SnowGolemBehavior.png|thumb|A group of snow golems throwing snowballs at a spider.]]
Snow golems move toward all [[monsters]] (except [[ghast]]s) and throw [[snowball]]s at them up to 10 [[block]]s away, provoking them, regardless of whether they attack the player.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/54362/what-is-a-snow-golems-range|title=What is a snow golem's range?|author=Ullallulloo|website=Arqade|date=March 8, 2012|quote=I tested this by making a hall in creative mode and blocking a zombie in a small chamber on one end and letting a snow golem go on the other. He ran forward until he was '''10 blocks away''' and started pelting the zombie with snowballs until I quit the game.}}</ref> When captured, they throw snowballs up to 16 blocks away (in [[Distance#Euclidean distance|Euclidian distance)]]. They throw one snowball per second. Thrown snowballs do not deal [[damage]] except to [[blaze]]s, but they still knock back any mobs that they hit.

Additionally, snow golems also attack [[creeper]]s. They never intentionally attack the player. {{IN|bedrock}}, if a snowball hits the player, it deals [[Damage#Knockback|knockback]] and makes tamed [[wolves]] and trusting [[fox]]es attack the snow golem. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, a snow golem's [[snowball]]s can also set other mobs on fire if the shot flies through a [[lava]] block or a block that is on fire.

A snow golem is not provoked by another [[golem]] (snow or iron) attacking it, although an [[iron golem]] that is hit accidentally by a snow golem's snowball attacks the snow golem.

A snow golem wears its [[carved pumpkin]] like a [[helmet]]. Its actual head is hidden beneath the pumpkin. [[Shearing]] a snow golem removes the pumpkin, revealing its derpy face and making it drop the pumpkin. The pumpkin is stored using the <code>Pumpkin</code> tag instead of <code>ArmorItems</code>; a snow golem does not display its <code>HandItems</code> or its <code>ArmorItems</code>. {{IN|java}}, after shearing the pumpkin, the player can give a snow golem a new pumpkin only by using a command, such as {{cmd|data}}.
