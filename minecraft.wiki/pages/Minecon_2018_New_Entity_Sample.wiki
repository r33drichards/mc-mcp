== Trivia ==
* Ducks were later added to {{MCD}} as a [[MCD:Duck|cosmetic pet]].
* Skeletaurs seem to have a bug that occasionally made their bow glow or simply not render properly.
* Scorpions would later reappear in an [[Golden Skull adventure|unreleased]] adventure map, demonstrated at [[Minecraft Live 2020]].<ref>{{YouTube link|oGThu5q-O3E|Minecraft Live: Creator Tools|Minecraft|October 16, 2020|t=5m24s}}</ref>
