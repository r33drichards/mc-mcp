'''24w11a''' is the twelfth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], released on March 14, 2024,<ref>{{snap|24w11a|March 14, 2024}}</ref> which adds breeze rods, heavy cores, the mace, 3 new pottery sherds, 2 new smithing templates and 2 new banner patterns behind experimental toggles, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Wolf armor]]'''
* Changed the crack textures.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bee]]s and [[parrot]]s'''
* Adjusted their flying behavior to keep them from overshooting their position when flying up and down.

'''[[Wolf]]'''
* When summoned using [[spawn egg]]s or [[commands]], the variant selection now follows the natural spawning biome rules with the following extensions:
** Rusty wolf is selected in [[jungle]]s and [[bamboo jungle]]s.
** Spotted wolf is selected in [[savanna]]s and [[windswept savanna]]s.
** Striped wolf is selected in [[badlands]] and [[eroded badlands]].

=== Command format ===
'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Removed <code>any</code> entity sub-predicate.
* Added slot name <code>contents</code> for single-slot entities like [[item frame]]s and [[item display]]s.
* Contents of <code>item</code> entity can now be accessed through <code>contents</code> slot name.
* Component-specific item predicate properties have been moved to separate field <code>predicates</code>.
** Some fields from item predicate have been moved to a map in an optional field <code>predicates</code>.
** The new field is similar to the <code>components</code> field on item stacks.
** This was done to simplify addition for future predicates and to allow sub-predicates to more closely resemble names of components they match.
** The following fields have been moved:
*** <code>enchantments</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:enchantments</code>
*** <code>stored_enchantments</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:stored_enchantments</code>
*** <code>potions</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:potion_contents</code>
*** <code>custom_data</code> - field moved to sub-predicate <code>minecraft:custom_data</code>
* <code>durability</code> field has been expanded to <code>minecraft:damage</code> predicate:
** This check now works for any item that has <code>minecraft:damage</code> component
** An item that does not have a <code>minecraft:damage</code> component can never match
** To check for unbreakable items, query value of <code>minecraft:unbreakable</code> component
** Fields:
*** <code>damage</code> - optional bounds for value of <code>minecraft:damage</code> component
*** <code>durability</code> - optional bounds for durability (max damage minus value of <code>minecraft:damage</code>)
* Predicates <code>minecraft:enchantments</code>, <code>minecraft:stored_enchantments</code>, <code>minecraft:potion_contents</code> and <code>minecraft:damage</code> require matching component to exist on item
** That means that, for example, matching for empty enchantment list doesn't pass on items without <code>minecraft:damage</code> component
** Note: some components, like <code>minecraft:enchantments</code> have default values, so they always match

=== General ===
'''[[Background]]'''
* Menu background blur has been updated to look better and improve performance.

'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* The data pack version is now <code>35</code>.
* Added <code>set_fireworks</code> loot function.
** New function for setting the details of the <code>minecraft:fireworks</code> component.

*** <code>conditions</code>: list of conditions (default: <code>[]</code>):
**** Conditions to check before applying the function
*** <code>flight_duration</code>: Optional integer, 0-255:

**** If omitted, the original <code>has_twinkle</code> value is kept (or <code>false</code> is used if there was no component)
* Added <code>set_book_cover</code> loot function.
** New function for setting the cover details of the <code>minecraft:written_book_content</code> component. If present, any pages in the book are left untouched.
** Fields:
*** <code>conditions</code>: list of conditions (default: <code>[]</code>):
**** Conditions to check before applying the function.
*** <code>title</code>: optional filterable text (same format as <code>title</code> on the <code>minecraft:written_book_content</code> component):

****** Size of range to be replaced in book.
****** If omitted, the size of <code>pages</code> field is used.
**** <code>insert</code>: insert pages, moving existing pages to after the inserted section. Arguments:
***** <code>offset</code>: optional non-negative integer:
****** Index before which pages are inserted.
****** If omitted, <code>0</code> (before first page) is used.
**** <code>append</code>: append pages at the end of the book.
* Added <code>set_written_book_pages</code> loot function.
** New function for manipulating the pages of the <code>minecraft:written_book_content</code> component. Same format as <code>set_writable_book_content</code> but the <code>pages</code> field contains filterable components instead of strings (same format as <code>pages</code> on the <code>minecraft:writable_book_content</code> component).
** Any cover data is left untouched, and the page content components are set to resolve next time a player opens the book.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* Status effect particle colors are no longer blended into one particle color.
** All active visible status effect particles are now rendered separately.
** The frequency of emitting status effect particles has been lowered to clutter the screen less.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* The resource pack version is now <code>29</code>.
* Added {{cd|d=and|gui/inworld_menu_background|gui/inworld_menu_list_background|gui/inworld_header_separator|gui/inworld_footer_separator}} textures to allow menus accessed from the pause menu to look different from menus accessed from the title screen.

== Experimental ==
=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Heavy Core JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Heavy core]]'''
* A mysterious, dense block which can be combined with a [[breeze rod]] to craft a [[mace]].
* Can be found as a loot reward in [[vault]]s with a chance of 2.2%.
* When placed, it has the same size as a [[player head]], and can be oriented in 12 directions.
* Mining a heavy core is pretty slow - it takes 45 seconds to mine and has no correct tool.
* Are fully resistant to explosions.
* Pop off immediately if pushed by a [[piston]].

==== Items ====
'''[[Banner pattern]]s'''
* Added two new banner patterns:
** [[File:Flow banner pattern.png|16px]] [[Flow banner pattern]]

'''[[File:Mace JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Mace]]'''
* A new heavy weapon that can be crafted from a breeze rod and a heavy core.
* Using the weapon while falling can increase the damage output. The higher the player falls, the more damage is dealt.
** This can be done by jumping towards the target and hitting them before the player hits the ground.
** Successfully striking a target in this way negates any damage accumulated from the fall, similar to how a [[wind charge]] works.
** Other entities near the struck enemy receive knockback.
* Can not be enchanted.
* Can be repaired with [[breeze rod]]s using an [[anvil]].
* Can be used to mine [[cobweb]]s, dropping [[string]]. 
* Players can use a mace in combination with wind charges to launch up and deliver devastating smash attacks on their enemies.

'''[[Pottery sherd]]s'''
* Added 3 new pottery sherds, that can be found on [[decorated pot]]s inside of [[trial chambers]]:
** [[File:Flow Pottery Sherd JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Flow pottery sherd]]

** [[File:Scrape Pottery Sherd JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Scrape pottery sherd]]

'''[[Smithing template]]s'''
* Added two new smithing templates, that are exclusively obtained from [[vault]]s:
** [[File:Armor Trim Bolt (sample model).png|32px]] [[File:Bolt Armor Trim Smithing Template JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bolt armor trim]]
** [[File:Armor Trim Flow (sample model).png|32px]] [[File:Flow Armor Trim Smithing Template JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Flow armor trim]]

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Trial Spawner JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Trial spawner]]s'''
* Now appear more frequently in the [[trial chambers]] corridors.

'''[[File:Vault (active) JE3 BE3.png|32px]] [[Vault]]s'''

** The player now gets no more than 1 unstackable item per vault.
** The player more often gets rewards which can stack together.

* Can now eject:
** [[Wind charge]]s
** [[Bolt armor trim]]
** [[Flow armor trim]]
** [[Flow banner pattern]]
** [[Guster banner pattern]]
** [[Heavy core]]
** [[Honey bottle]]
** [[Arrow]]
** [[Arrow of Poison]]
** [[Golden apple]]

==== Mobs ====
'''[[File:Breeze JE1.webp|32px]] [[Breeze]]'''
* Drops 1-2 [[breeze rod]]s instead of wind charges when killed by a player.
** The number of breeze rods dropped is affected by [[Looting]].

==== World generation ====
'''[[File:Isometric Chamber-6.png|32px]] [[Trial chambers]]'''
* Added new chambers and variations, with new challenges.
