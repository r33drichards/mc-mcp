A '''stained glass pane''' is a dyed version of a [[glass pane]]. It is a transparent [[block]] that can be used as a more efficient alternative to [[stained glass]] blocks.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Stained glass panes can be obtained using a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. If one is broken without a Silk Touch enchantment, it drops nothing.

Stained glass panes do not have an assigned tool; they are mined at the same speed regardless of what tool is used.<ref>{{bug|MC-179316||Glass blocks do not have an assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Stained Glass Pane|sprite=stained-glass-panes|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===

* Orange and red stained glass panes generate in [[savanna]] [[village]] temples. 
* Yellow stained glass panes generate in [[plains]] and savanna village temples. 
* Brown stained glass panes generate in [[Village#Abandoned villages|abandoned village]]s. 
* White stained glass panes generate in [[plains]] [[village]] temples.

== Usage ==
Stained glass panes are more efficient to use than stained glass blocks, as six stained glass blocks can be crafted into sixteen stained glass panes, yielding 2{{frac|2|3}} panes per block. Windows built using stained glass panes can be up to 267% (2{{fraction|2|3}} times) larger in area than windows built with regular stained glass blocks. In Java Edition, stained glass panes appear as flat items inside the inventory, with the front face taking up the entire inventory slot. With the default texture pack, the light gray variant in particular is barely visible in the inventory due to its low contrast to the background of the slot. This can make containers appear empty when they are not.
[[File:Glass with spider-shaped hole.png|thumb|150px|A single space between two glass panes results in a 2×1 hole, which [[spider]]s can pass through.]]

=== Placement ===
If placed without anything on the sides, they appear as a thin vertical • shape, 2×2 pixels in size; but when other blocks occupy adjacent spaces, it becomes flat or turns into a [[File:Curve.png|text-top]] or [[File:T junction.png|text-top]] or [[File:Cross.png|text-top]] shape depending on the items surrounding it. The collision box is identical to the shape of the pane. Therefore, two glass panes placed with one empty space in between forms a gap that is two blocks wide.

Stained glass panes are never oriented horizontally. Horizontal stained glass surfaces must be made from stained glass blocks.

Stained glass panes can be [[waterlogged]], which means water can be in the same place as a glass pane, unlike regular stained glass.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Any Stained Glass Pane}}

Unlike regular glass panes, stained glass panes cannot be used to lock [[map]]s.

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|java}}, due to its flat appearance in the inventory slot and the inventory being colored light gray, light gray stained glass panes almost appear invisible.<ref>{{bug|MC-36498|||WAI}}</ref>
* The textures of stained glass and stained glass panes still use the old colors from prior to the 1.12 World of Color update. The texture colors were not changed in 1.12's development, and the retexturing in 1.14 did not adjust the colors to the new 1.12 color palette.<ref name="unchanged colors"></ref>
