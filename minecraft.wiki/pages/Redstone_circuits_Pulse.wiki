A '''pulse circuit''' is a [[redstone circuit]] which generates, modifies, detects, or otherwise operates on redstone [[#Pulses|pulses]].

== <span class="anchor" id="pulse"></span> Pulses ==

A '''pulse''' is a temporary change in redstone power that eventually reverts to its original state.

An '''on-pulse''' is when a redstone signal turns on, then off again. On-pulses are usually just called "pulses" unless there is a need to differentiate them from off-pulses.

An '''off-pulse''' is when a redstone signal turns off, then on again.

The '''pulse length''' of a pulse is how long it lasts. Short pulses are described in '''redstone ticks'''. For example, a "3-tick pulse" is a pulse that turns off 0.3 seconds (or 6 [[tick|game ticks]]) after it turns on. Longer pulses, meanwhile, are measured in any convenient unit of time (for example, a "3-second pulse").

{{anchor|rising edge}}The '''rising edge''' of a pulse is when the power turns on – the beginning of an on-pulse or the end of an off-pulse.

{{anchor|falling edge}}The '''falling edge''' of a pulse is when the power turns off – the end of an on-pulse or the beginning of an off-pulse.

=== Pulse logic ===

Pulse logic is a different approach to binary logic than standard redstone power binary (power present = 1, power absent = 0). In pulse logic, the pulse is a toggle of logic level of the contraption: (first pulse = 1, second pulse = 0). This approach allows implementing computational logic that operates not only on redstone signal, but also on block updates, and block positions; in particular implementation of mobile logical circuits in [[Tutorial:Flying machines|flying machines]], and significant reduction of server-side lag through avoiding redstone dust, transporting signals through block updates instead - e.g. over [[Powered Rail]]. In many cases use of pulse logic also results in more compact circuitry, and allows building 1-tileable modules where classic redstone power would "spill" to the neighbor modules. 

Conversion from classic redstone binary to pulse logic is performed through dual edge detectors, (usually just an [[Observer]] observing redstone dust or other power components), and conversion back is performed through [[T flip-flop]] circuits, in particular the block-dropping behavior of sticky pistons. That behavior is also utilized as memory storage in pulse logic, position of the block encoding state of memory cell.

=== Pulse interactions ===

Some redstone components react differently to short pulses:

* In ''Java Edition'', a [[piston]] or sticky piston usually takes 1 tick to extend. If the activation pulse ends before the extension does, the piston or sticky piston "aborts" – it places the first of the pushed blocks at its final position (only if it's a sticky piston) and return to its retracted state instantly. This can cause sticky pistons to "drop" their block – they push a block and then return to their retracted state without pulling it back.
* A [[redstone comparator]] does not always activate when given a 1 tick pulse and never activates when given pulses shorter than 1 tick.
* A [[redstone lamp]] can be deactivated only by an off-pulse of minimum 2 ticks.
* A [[redstone repeater]] does increase the length of pulses which are shorter than its delay to match its delay (for example, a 4-tick repeater changes any pulse shorter than 4 ticks into a 4-tick pulse).
* In ''Java Edition'', a [[redstone torch]] does not always activate when given a 1 tick pulse and never activates when given pulses shorter than 1 tick.

=== Pulse analysis ===

When building circuits, it can sometimes be helpful to observe the pulses being produced to confirm their duration or spacing.

{{Schematic
 | caption ='''Oscilloscope'''
:''1&times;N&times;2, flat, silent''

An oscilloscope allows you to watch pulses as they move through the repeaters.
 | input+&rarr; | rr-e1 | rr-e1 | rr-e1! | rr-e1! | rr-e1 | rr-e1 | rr-e1! | rr-e1! | ellipsis-ew
}}
{{anchor|oscilloscope}}A pulse can be measured with 1-tick precision with an '''oscilloscope''' (see schematic, right).

An oscilloscope simply consists of a line of 1-tick repeaters (aka a "racetrack"). An oscilloscope should be constructed to be at least as long as the expected pulse, plus a few extra repeaters (the more repeaters, the easier it is to time capturing a pulse). For periodic pulses (as from [[clock circuit]]s), an oscilloscope should be at least as long as the clock period (both the on and off parts of the pulse).

An oscilloscope can be frozen to aid reading by:
* using an oak sign next to the design.
* positioning the oscilloscope on the screen so that it can be viewed when the player pauses the game, or
* taking a screenshot with {{key|F2}}, or
* running repeaters into the side of the oscilloscope and powering them simultaneously to lock the repeaters of the oscilloscope.

An oscilloscope is not capable of displaying fractional-tick pulses directly (0.5-tick pulses, 1.5-tick pulses, etc.), but for fractional-tick pulses greater than 1 tick, the pulse length may appear to change as it moves through the oscilloscope. For example, a 3.5-tick pulse may sometimes power 3 repeaters and sometimes 4 repeaters.

Half-tick pulses do not vary between powering 0 or 1 repeaters (they just look like 1-tick pulses), but half-tick and 1-tick pulses can be differentiated with a [[redstone comparator]] – a 1-tick pulse can activate a comparator, but a half-tick pulse cannot in most cases.

Multiple oscilloscopes can be laid in parallel to compare different pulses. For example, you can determine a circuit's delay by putting the circuit's input signal through one oscilloscope and the circuit's output through another and counting the difference between the input and output signal edges.

Oscilloscopes are useful but sometimes require you to be in an inconvenient position to observe them. If you just need to observe the simultaneity of multiple pulses it can be useful to use pistons or note blocks and observe their movement or note particles from any angle. Redstone lamps are less useful for this purpose because they take 2 ticks to turn off.

== <span class="anchor" id="monostable"></span> Monostable circuit ==

A circuit is '''monostable''' if it has only one stable output state ("mono-" means "one", so "monostable" means "one stable state").

A circuit's output can be powered or unpowered. If an output stays in the same state until the circuit is triggered again, that output state is called "stable". An output state that changes without the input being triggered is not stable (that doesn't necessarily mean it's random – it may be an intentional change after a designed delay).

If a circuit has only ''one'' stable output state then the circuit is called "monostable". For example, if a powered state inevitably reverts to the unpowered state, but the unpowered state doesn't change until the input is triggered.

When someone says "monostable circuit" in ''Minecraft'', they usually mean a [[#Pulse generator|pulse generator]] or a [[#Pulse limiter|pulse limiter]]. However, any redstone circuit which produces a finite number of pulses is technically a monostable circuit (all the circuits in this article, in fact, as well as some others), so instead of saying monostable circuit, it can be helpful to be more specific:

* A [[#Pulse generator|pulse generator]] generates a pulse
* A [[#Pulse length limiter|pulse limiter]] reduces the duration of long pulses
* A [[#Pulse extender|pulse extender]] increases the length of short pulses
* A [[#Pulse multiplier|pulse multiplier]] produces multiple output pulses in response to a single input pulse
* A [[#Pulse divider|pulse divider]] produces an output pulse after a specific number of input pulses
* An [[#Edge detector|edge detector]] produces an output pulse when it detects a specific edge of an input pulse
* A [[#Pulse length detector|pulse length detector]] produces an output pulse when it detects an input pulse of a specific length
<!--* A pulse delay produces an output pulse some time after the input pulse-->
* A [[Tutorial:Block update detector|block update detector]] produces an output pulse when a specific block is updated (for example, stone is mined, water turns to ice, etc.)
* A [[Tutorial:Comparator update detector|comparator update detector]] produces an output pulse when a specific comparator is updated by an inventory update

[[Clock circuit]]s also produce pulses, but they aren't monostable because they have ''no'' stable output states (they are "astable") unless forced into one by external interference (for example, when they're turned off). [[Logic circuit|Logic]] and [[memory circuit]]s aren't monostable because ''both'' of their output states are stable (they are "bistable") – they don't change unless triggered by their input.

{{See also|Wikipedia:Monostable}}

== <span class="anchor" id="pulsegen"></span> Pulse generator ==

A '''pulse generator''' creates an output pulse when triggered.

Most pulse generators consist of an input and a [[#Pulse length limiter|pulse limiter]]. A [[#Pulse extender|pulse extender]] can be added on to generate a longer pulse.

The observer pulse generator is one of the most common pulse generators due to its adaptability. It can be oriented in almost any direction, and the observer can be oriented in almost any direction, allowing for lots of flexibility. And depending on where the output is taken from, it can be a rising or falling edge pulse generator. The observer can also be updated by other circuitry to send more pulses from the output.

:''Variations:'' The piston base can be oriented in any way; the same is true for the observer except for facing the piston itself. Output can be taken from either the extended or retracted position to change which edge it activates on.

:A NOR-gate pulse generator compares the current power to the power from 2 ticks ago – if the current power is on and the previous power was off, the output torch flashes on briefly.

:This design uses a trick to limit the output pulse to a single tick. A redstone torch cannot be activated by a 1-tick pulse from exterior sources, but a torch activated by a 2-tick exterior pulse can short-circuit itself into a 1-tick pulse. To increase the output pulse to 2 ticks, remove the block over the output torch. To then increase it to 3 ticks, increase the delay on the repeater to 4 ticks.

== <span class="anchor" id="pulse shortener"></span> Pulse length limiter ==

A '''pulse limiter''' (aka "pulse shortener") reduces the length of a long pulse.

An '''ideal pulse limiter''' would allow shorter pulses through unchanged, but in practice the range of input pulse can often be determined (or guessed) and it is sufficient to use a circuit which produces a specific pulse shorter than expected input pulses.

Any [[#Rising edge detector|rising edge detector]] can also be used as a pulse limiter.

: A '''hopper-clock pulse extender''' is a hopper clock with one of the sticky pistons replaced with a regular piston so that it doesn't pull the block of redstone back, but instead wait for the input to trigger a new clock cycle.

: A hopper-clock pulse extender with a single item in its hoppers produces a 4-tick output pulse. Each additional item adds 8 ticks to the output pulse (unlike the [[#dropper-latch pulse extender|dropper-latch pulse extender]], the output of a hopper-clock pulse extender can be adjusted only in 8-tick increments).

: While waiting for the input to turn on, the sticky piston is actually in a state where it is powered but doesn't know it (like a stuck-piston BUD circuit) until "woken up" by the input changing its power level. This works as long as the input power level is different than the resting output of the powered comparator (unintuitively, it even works if the input power level is ''less'' than the comparator output).
: '''Caveats:'''
:: - Any block or redstone update near the powered & stuck sticky piston can trigger it, so care should be taken to keep other circuit activity away from the sticky piston.
:: - The timer/counter part starts after the rising edge of the input pulse. -> At worst the output pulse is only "''input_pulse + extender_time/2''" not "''input_pulse + extender_time''". For "''input_pulse < extender_time/2''" it's always just "''extender_time''".

:When the input turns on, the torch turns off, allowing both clocks to cycle into a state where the bottom clock continues to hold the torch off until it's completed one full cycle. The number of items in the top hoppers determines the top clock's cycle period, and its block of redstone moves every half-cycle, allowing the bottom clock to move one item.

:The half-cycle is equal to the number of items in the top hoppers times 4 ticks (or 0.4 seconds per item) – up to 128 seconds for 320 items. The bottom clock keeps the output on for a number of half-cycles equal to twice the number of items in the bottom hoppers, minus 1.

:"MHDC" stands for "multiplicative hopper-dropper clock" (a dropper counter multiplies the clock period of a hopper clock).

:When the input turns on, the torch turns off, allowing both clocks to cycle into a state where the bottom clock continues to hold the torch off until it's completed one full cycle. The hoppers can hold up to 320 items (X) and the droppers can hold up to 576 items (Y). The duration of the output pulse is X × (2Y-1) × 0.8 seconds.

: This pulse extender uses a command block to slow the hopper transfer rate. The exact command depends on the direction the pulse extender is facing, but for a pulse extender facing the positive X direction it look something like this: <code>/data modify block ~2 ~ ~ TransferCooldown set value X</code>, where X is the number of [[game tick]]s (up to 32,767) to hold the item in the hopper (20 game ticks = 1 second, lag permitting).

: When the command block is powered directly it activates the adjacent dropper, pushing the item into the hopper to power the output, and simultaneously changes the hopper's cooldown time to delay when it pushes the item back to the dropper.

== Pulse multiplier ==

A '''pulse multiplier''' turns one input pulse into multiple output pulses.

There are three primary strategies for designing pulse multipliers:
* Split the input pulse into multiple paths that arrive at the output at different times
* Enable a clock to run while the input pulse is on
* Trigger a clock that runs for a finite number of cycles, independent of the input pulse length

In case the player requires only the pulse frequency to be doubled, usually a simple [[Pulse circuit#ded|dual edge detector]] is often sufficient:

;Observer pulse doubler

}}

::''1×1×1 (1 block), flat, silent, 1-tileable''
::''circuit delay: 1 tick''
::''output pulses: 2 1-tick pulses the length of input pulse apart.''

:An observer watching the input signal (redstone dust, button, repeater set to 1 tick, etc) produces a pulse on each of the edges of the input, producing two 1-tick pulses on each edge of the input pulse, providing the input pulse is sufficiently long (3 redstone ticks minimum). If the pulse is shorter than this, a redstone lamp can be put infront of the observer to remedy this issue.

=== Split-path pulse multiplier ===

A '''split-path pulse multiplier''' produces multiple pulses by splitting the input signal into multiple paths and having them arrive at the output at different times. This usually requires first reducing the length of the input pulse with a [[#Pulse length limiter|pulse length limiter]] to reduce the delay required between each output pulse.

An '''enabled-clock pulse multiplier''' runs a clock for as long as the input stays on, thus producing a number of pulses relative to the input pulse length.

{{-}}

=== Triggered-clock pulse multiplier ===

A '''triggered-clock pulse multiplier''' consists of a clock circuit that is allowed to run for a specific number of cycles once triggered. Strategies for designing a triggered-clock pulse multiplier include using a latch to turn the clock on and have the clock itself reset the latch back off after one or one-half clock cycles, or using a pulse extender to run a clock.

::''3×4×2 (24 blocks), flat, silent''

:This pulse multiplier produce one 2-tick pulse for every item placed in the bottom dropper (with a 2-tick off-pulse between each on-pulse).

:After it has finished its pulses, it requires a reset time equal to 0.4 seconds × pulse count. If it is reactivated during this time, it produces fewer pulses.

: If the input pulse is longer than the output pulses, the powered dropper prevents the clock from turning off because the disabled hopper can't push its item back. If a long input pulse is possible, place a solid block between the input and the dropper so that it activates without being powered.

=={{anchor|pulse counter}}Pulse divider ==

A '''pulse divider''' (a.k.a. "pulse counter") produces an output pulse after a specific number of input pulses – in other words, it turns multiple input pulses into one output pulse.

Because a pulse divider must count the input pulses to know when to produce an output pulse, it has some similarity to a ring counter (an ''n''-state memory circuit with only one state on). The difference is that a ring counter's output state changes only when its internal count is changed by an input trigger, while a pulse divider produces an output pulse and then returns to the same unpowered output it had before its count was reached (in other words, a pulse divider is monostable but a ring counter is bistable). Any ring counter can be converted into a pulse divider just by adding a pulse limiter to its output (making it monostable).  

In addition to the circuits here, a [[Clock circuit#Clock multiplier|clock multiplier]] can function as a pulse divider (or a ring counter, for that matter); unlike these circuits, its output remains ON until the next input pulse turns it off.

:This is a hopper-loop ring counter with an incorporated pulse limiter on the output.

:Each input pulse turns the redstone dust off for 1 tick, allowing the item to move to the next hopper. When the item reaches the dropper it turns on the output briefly, until the redstone dust turning back on activates the dropper to push the item to the next hopper.

:To count an even number of pulses, replace another hopper with a dropper. Putting the second dropper right before the first dropper changes the output pulse to 6 ticks.

:The output is signal strength 1 or 3 (with a stackable or non-stackable item in the hoppers) so may need to be boosted with a repeater.

:''Variations:'' Removing the dust from on top of the dropper and replacing the dropper with a hopper increases the output pulse to 4 ticks but makes the entire circuit silent.

:Once it has begun its output pulse, the pulse divider goes through a reset period of (4 × pulse count) ticks (the same length as the output pulse). Any new input pulses during the reset period is not counted, but only extends the reset period.

::''input:'' 2  off-ticks, use a pulse limiter if necessary
::''output pulse:'' 2  off-ticks
::''delay:'' 3 ticks (per unit in stack)

:The inverted binary divider or counter uses the latching feature of redstone repeaters to create a two-state (binary) counter. Multiple counters can be stacked to construct an ''n''-bit counter, giving 2<sup>''n''</sup> input pulses per output pulse. It is called 'inverted' because it counts the number of ''off'' pulses, rather than on-pulses. Note that it triggers every two off-ticks, so holding the input low causes it to count multiple times then burn out a redstone torch. You may want to use a [[#Pulse limiter|pulse limiter]] on the input signal to prevent this.

:Used purely as a pulse divider or counter this circuit is somewhat inefficient, since it would have to be stacked nine times to be able to count almost as many pulses (512) as the [[#dropper-dropper pulse divider|dropper-dropper divider]]. However, the stacking binary design means that the pulse count value can be easily read out by simply taking an output line from each stack element. In combination with OR or NOR gates, this can be used to trigger an output after an arbitrary number of pulses, or to create a divider for any number when combined with the reset circuit below.

; 'Tall' binary counter

::2×5×3 (30 block volume)
::silent, 2-wide stackable (alternating)

:Functionally the same as the flat (3×5×2) binary counter, but takes one extra vertical block and one less horizontally, which may be an advantage when stacking them together. Requires an extra torch compared to the flat circuit.

; Binary counter reset circuit

:Adding this to the binary counter circuit allows it to be reset at any time; this can be used to create a counter for any desired number, or even a programmable counter (with extra circuits to select the number). This can be applied to either version, though the schematic shows it connected to the 'tall' version.

:Like the counter itself, the reset circuit is ''active low''; it requires at least three off-ticks to perform the reset, although the actual reset does not take place until the rising edge (end) of the off-pulse. (A standard button followed by an inverter works fine, as seen in the screenshot.)

: A cheap, noisy option to output 1 out of 2<sup>n</sup> pulses (1 in 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc.), indefinitely extensible - each next module (repeater-piston pair) doubling the divider. Depends on the Java Edition's quirk of sticky pistons 'spitting out' their payload when activated with 1-tick pulses and quasi-connectivity. If the input pulse is longer than 1 tick, the first module acts as pulse limiter instead of a 'memory cell', so the only modification needed for this sort of input is adding one more module vs 1-ticked input (e.g. from an observer). The output pulse can be extended up to 4 ticks by increasing the tick count on the last repeater.

: Use as a binary counter requires reading position of the blocks moved by the pistons, e.g. through repeaters one block above the 'rest' position.
:If the input has mixed length pulses, both 1-tick and longer, set the first repeater to 2 ticks and treat the first piston as pulse limiter, not counter module.

A comparator can't produce a 1-tick pulse by subtraction from an exterior source (such as if the repeater was set to a 1-tick delay), but if the external source would usually produce a 2-tick pulse or more, the comparator can short-circuit itself into a 1-tick pulse by incorporating it into a [[Clock circuit#subtraction 1-clock|subtraction 1-clock]] (the block and parallel dust after the comparator), but allowing the clock to run for only one cycle.

:''Variations:'' Remove the final block and dust to increase the output pulse to 2 ticks. Then increase the delay on the subtraction repeater to increase the output pulse length further.

:The block of redstone moves when the signal turns on and when it turns off. While it is moving it cannot power the redstone dust, so the output torch turns on until the block of redstone stops moving.

:In the 1-wide version the block over the output torch short-circuits it into a 1-tick pulse – remove the block and take the output directly from the torch to increase the output pulse to 1.5 ticks. To get an output on the same side as the input, the torch can be placed on the other side of the bottom blocks (but without the block above it, which would clock the piston). The piston and block of redstone can be moved to the side of the dust, rather than on top of the dust, producing a shorter but wider circuit.

The most trivial way to build a dual edge detector is to OR the outputs of a [[#nor-gate rising edge detector|NOR-gate rising edge detector]] and a [[#nor-gate falling edge detector|NOR-gate falling edge detector]].
A useful feature of this approach is that you get the rising- and falling-only pulses for free if you need them.
If rsource or space usage is more important than timing, parts of the components of the 2 single edge detectors can be shared (the middle row of the example in the [[#schematics-DED|Schematic Gallery: Dual Edge Detector]]).
Again, the blocks above the torches limit the output pulse to 1 tick.

The Scaffolding propagates updates containing distance from supported scaffolding block. By moving a block under a suspended section of scaffolding, the player can send a signal an arbitrary distance upward and up to six blocks horizontally in any direction. The signal propagates at 1 block per redstone tick.

:''1 tick regardless of distance, 1-tileable (see caveat)''

[[Wall]] blocks (cobblestone wall etc.) instantly transmit signal arbitrary distance down by turning themselves and all wall block below from smooth wall segment to a pillar segment if certain blocks are placed on them or attached from a side. To form a smooth segment, a wall needs two other wall blocks or other blocks wall can attach to, adjacent to it from two opposite sides. If they are other wall blocks though, it doesn't matter if they are smooth or pillars - so the solution is 1-tileable, but requires uninterrupted columns of full blocks (or wall) on far ends.  Probably the most practical way to toggle a wall between these states is a redstone-controlled [[trapdoor]]. The readout through an observer is possible only from below though, as the wall connects to an observer from a side.
