{{redirect|Default|the font internally referred to as "default" {{in|je}}|Mojangles}}
The '''world type''' is used to determine how worlds generate in ''[[Minecraft]]''.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
{{main|World preset|Custom world preset}}
When creating a new world, in the "More world options..." screen, players can choose which world preset to use, or not use world preset. [[World preset]]s are used to determine the dimensions the world has, which can be controlled by data packs.

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
The world type is only visible in the "Game Settings" tab in the [[pause menu]]. Worlds are generated by default with the "Infinite" world type, and this can be changed to "Flat" by turning on the "Flat world" option in the [[Create New World]] screen. In the [[Edit World]] screen, it is only visible whether the world has been created as a flat world, with the selected preset, or not.

| style="text-align:center" | {{anchor|Default|Infinite}} '''Infinite world'''
| This is the default world generation type. It features the generation of various landscapes, making use of [[biome]]s to separate the [[world]] into different environments.

|-
| style="text-align:center" | {{anchor|Superflat|Flat}}'''[[Flat world]]'''
| This world type makes the Overworld completely flat. By default, the terrain consists of one layer of [[bedrock]], two layers of [[dirt]] and one layer of [[grass]]; the surface is therefore at Y=-60. [[Mob|Mobs]] spawn normally; [[Slime|slimes]] are prevalent. [[Structures]] do not generate in flat worlds.
It can be further customized with the [[Superflat#Default presets|flat world presets]], which allow the player to change terrain layers.

|-
| style="text-align:center" | {{anchor|Void}}'''Void world'''
| This world type is exclusive to ''[[Bedrock Editor]]''. It generates a completely empty world in all dimensions and uses the [[ocean]] biome in the Overworld, [[Nether wastes]] in the Nether, and [[The End (biome)|the End]] in the End. The player spawns on a 5x7 platform from [[grass block]]s centered at the world at Y=0. An [[oak sign]] on the platform reads: "Courtesy Platform Remove if not required". The [[exit portal]] and the [[ender dragon]] still exist in the End.

{{outdated|section=1|edition=Bedrock|edition2=education|Old worlds can no longer be created after [[Bedrock Edition 1.18.0]], but existing old worlds can still be played and converted.}}
This world generation type had a finite area of 256×256 blocks with an [[invisible bedrock]] barrier surrounding it.
Converting from old to infinite world is possible.
