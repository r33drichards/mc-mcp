'''Nether quartz ore''' is an [[ore]] found in [[the Nether]], and is a source of [[quartz]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Nether quartz ore can be mined with any [[pickaxe]]. If mined by hand, it drops nothing. If mined with [[Silk Touch]], the block drops itself. Otherwise, it drops 1 [[Nether quartz]] (up to 4 quartz when mined with [[Fortune III]]). It also drops {{xp|2|5}} when broken.

=== Natural generation ===
Nether quartz ore can generate in [[the Nether]] in the form of [[ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. Nether quartz ore attempts to replace [[netherrack]] 16 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-24, from levels 10 to 117, in all Nether biomes. {{IN|java}}, in basalt deltas, Nether quartz ore attempts to generate 32 times per chunk as there are fewer valid generation areas.

== Usage ==
The primary usage of Nether quartz ore is to [[#Breaking|mine]] it for [[Nether quartz]].
=== Smelting ingredient ===
{{Smelting
|showname=1
|Nether Quartz Ore
|Nether Quartz
|0.2}}

Note that mining the block directly with a tool enchanted with any [[Fortune]] level produces more [[Nether quartz]].

=== Note Blocks ===
Nether quartz ore can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Breaking one Nether quartz ore provides 3.5 [[experience]] points on average, so breaking about 100 of them raises the player from level 0 to 16, and about 400 from level 0 to 30.
* Nether quartz ore is generated as part of the dimension, while [[netherrack]] is generated as part of the biome.{{only|java}}
** This can be seen, as when a [[Single biome]] world with the Nether biome is generated, there is netherrack but no quartz ore.
** {{IN|bedrock}}, if the Nether is generated in the Overworld as a biome, neither netherrack nor Nether quartz ore is generated, but the terrain is completely made out of stone with bedrock ceiling.
