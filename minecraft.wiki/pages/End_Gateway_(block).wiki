The '''End gateway''' is a block that forms a part of [[End gateway]]s, which teleport the player between the [[Terrain features#Central island|central island]] and the [[Terrain features#Outer islands|outer islands]] in [[the End]].

== Obtaining ==
[[File:Endgatewaycommand.jpg|thumb|The command used to get an End gateway.]]

The End gateway block cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. The item form doesn't exist {{in|java}}, but it can be obtained through [[add-on]]s or external editors or by using bugs {{in|bedrock}}.<!--video is not being linked to because we do not need to promote the glitch on the wiki-->

The End gateway block can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}} {{in|java}}. It cannot be placed by such commands {{in|bedrock}} but it can be placed using structure blocks.

=== Natural generation ===
More naturally generated gateways that transport the player back to the [[End platform]] can be found throughout the outer End islands. They will not create new gateways on the central island.

=== Post-generation ===
[[File:End gateway JE3 BE2.png|thumb|150px|An End gateway]]
End gateway blocks form the functional part of [[End gateway]]s. Each time the [[ender dragon]] is defeated, one End gateway spawns around the [[Terrain features#Central island|central island]] in [[the End]], up to 20 times. Activating each of them spawns one additional gateway in the [[Terrain features#Outer islands|outer islands]].

== Usage ==
End gateway blocks in their original form can be used to teleport to the outer islands of the End. End gateway blocks can be used as a custom teleporter using NBT tags{{only|java}}.

* <code>exit_portal</code> tag holds a set of X/Y/Z coordinates to determine the general location the player can be "safely" teleported to when entering.
* Setting <code>ExactTeleport</code> to 1 teleports entities to the specified coordinates exactly instead of at a safer location around those coordinates.
* <code>Age</code> determines how long the gateway has existed. This is used to determine when the beam is rendered.
* Example: {{cmd|/setblock ~ ~-1 ~1 minecraft:end_gateway{Age:180,ExactTeleport:1,exit_portal:[I;1,2,3]<nowiki />} replace}}

When created in a dimension other than [[the End]] without exit_portal NBT data, it does not teleport entities but still activates its beam effect when an entity enters.

{{IN|Bedrock|Education}}, the gateway {{control|placed}} by the player in the End teleports entities to (0, 0, 0), below the main island. In the [[Overworld]] or [[Nether]], it acts as a solid block and cannot teleport entities.

=== Beam ===
When generated (either naturally as part of an [[End gateway]], or through {{cmd|setblock}}{{only|java}}), the block emits a {{color|#C354CD|magenta}} beam of light vertically from its top and bottom, lasting for {{convert|200|tick|second}} while fading in and out.

An End gateway block also emits a {{color|#7B2FBE|purple}} beam of light vertically from the top and bottom when an [[entity]] enters it. During the {{convert|40|tick|second}} this beam is visible, no additional entities can be teleported.

It also emits the {{color|#7B2FBE|purple}} teleport beam every {{convert|2400|tick|minute}}. This beam also lasts {{convert|40|tick|second}} and disables teleportation of the gateway while it's visible<ref>{{Bug|MC-107824|3=End Gateway shows beacon beam every 2400 ticks even if no entity teleported|4=WAI}}</ref>.

The creation beam extends from around<!-- behavior is complicated and slightly buggy --> Y=0 through the block up to Y=256; the teleport beam goes 50 blocks above and below the gateway block. The beam is visible from roughly the same distance as a single ordinary stack of blocks. If a render distance of 16 chunks is set, the beam of light is visible from up to 255 blocks away. Unlike the beam of a [[beacon]], this beam does not change color if the player puts [[stained glass]] over it.

It is not possible to disable either of the beams entirely. However, it is possible to edit the age of the block to a negative value, effectively delaying beam-emitting properties of the End gateway. You can change the age of the block by entering the command (for example) as follows: <code>/setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:end_gateway{Age:-9223372036854775808L}</code>. This will last for 14,993,257,186 years, effectively disabling the beam.

=== Piston interactivity ===
An End gateway block cannot be pushed or pulled by [[piston]]s or [[sticky piston]]s.

=== Block data ===
An End gateway block has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
** {{nbt|long|Age}}: Age of the portal, in ticks. This is used to determine when the beam is rendered.

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|bedrock}}, if one manages to place an End gateway at the center of the [[End platform]], it teleports the [[player]] before the platform regenerates. As a result, the platform appears in a different location than it should, like below the [[Terrain features#Central island|central island]].
