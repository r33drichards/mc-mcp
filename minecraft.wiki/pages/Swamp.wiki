A '''swamp''' or '''swampland''' is a wetland [[biome]] where [[slime]]s, [[frog]]s, and [[bogged]] can spawn.

== Description ==
Swamps have sparse [[oak tree]]s which can grow on land or in shallow water and generate with [[vines]] growing on them. [[Mushroom]]s are more common here than in most Overworld biomes. [[Sugar cane]] is found often growing on shores. [[Seagrass]] litters the bottom of flooded areas. [[Firefly bush]]es and [[blue orchid]]s grow among the grass, the latter of which are found exclusively in swamps. [[Lily pad]]s are scattered across the surface of the water and [[dead bush]]es dot the surface of the land. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[huge mushroom]]s can generate as well.

Swamp biomes, alongside [[mangrove swamp]]s and [[desert]]s, can generate rare underground [[fossil]]s.

A swamp rarely generates [[swamp hut]]s, housing a [[witch]] and a black [[cat]]. Only witches can spawn in and around the hut.

Swamps have elevations low enough to go below sea level throughout much of the area. A large portion of swamps are flooded, where patches of [[clay]] are found on the lakebed. The shores of swamps may have marsh-like terrain, where the shores are very irregular, often without smooth transition, and with some small puddles generated. [[Water]] in swamps takes on a gray-green color.

Underwater [[fog]] is thick here so that visibility is lower than in other biomes underwater. Additionally, unlike other [[Overworld]] biomes, swamps have varying tints for [[grass block]]s, [[grass]], and [[leaves]], etc. See [[Biome#Special plant tints]].

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], swamps have a unique dark green sky color, and stronger fog effects. The fog fades the [[sun]] and sunlight and also applies underwater.

=== Generation ===
The swamp biome generates at temperatures of -0.45 to 0.2, meaning it generates at the temperate and cold biome temperature noise values. Swamps generate next to most [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], [[flower forest]]s, most [[forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[dark forest]]s, most [[taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, and some [[windswept savanna]]s. Swamp biomes are usually found in flat terrain near sea level in regions with very high [[World_generation#Biomes|erosion]] values, and they also replace [[river]]s in these areas. Swamps never directly border the [[ocean]], with some other biomes generating between them instead. However, their water bodies are often connected to the ocean.

== Mobs ==
[[Slime]]s may spawn in swamps during the night, exclusively between Y=50 and Y=70, making swamps and mangrove swamps the only places where slimes can be found above ground. Their spawn rate is affected by the [[moon phase]], spawning most often during full moon and not spawning at all during new moon. Bogged add an additional threat to the night, thunderstorms, or [[Cave|caves]]{{Only|Java|short=JE}}, as their poison arrows can increase the danger of [[hostile mob]]s.

[[Villager]]s that spawn in swamps get a unique swamp-themed look. While villagers have swamp-specific types, no [[village]] featuring exclusively these villagers can be generated. The only way for these villagers to spawn is either by being bred in a swamp, curing a [[zombie villager]] that spawned in a swamp, or finding a [[village]] that generated with some parts reaching the swamp.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
