== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Quartz is an unusual block in that you can only use it for decoration. In fact, all the things you can make with quartz are just used for decoration: the chiseled quartz block, two types of quartz stairs, quartz pillars, and smooth quartz.|Nova Barlow in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/build-it--quartz- Build With It: Quartz]}}

{{Quote|There are plenty of places to go looking if you’re short on diamonds! You can mine them in caverns, or set your sights on the numerous chests scattered around the world – shipwrecks, minecarts in abandoned mineshafts, strongholds, jungle temples, buried treasure chests, woodland mansions, and more. Even village chests can potentially hold these glittery gems.|Nova Barlow in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/build-it--diamond- Build With It: Diamond Block]}}

{{Quote|You’ve likely seen stained glass in some of your favorite community builds, but just in case you need even more creative samples, we’ve gathered a few more favorites to demonstrate how versatile this material can be.|Nova Barlow in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/build-it--stained-glass- Build With It: Stained Glass]}}

{{Quote|If so much orange is a little much for you, then we recommend using it more subtly as an accent on a wall, or perhaps a table inside your home.|Nova Barlow in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/build-with-it--acacia- Build With It: Acacia!]}}
