===Additions===
====Mobs====
'''[[Breeze]]'''
*The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within the Trial Chambers
*The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances
*An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target
*Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity
*After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks
*Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
**Non-Iron [[Doors]] and [[Trapdoors]] are flipped
**[[Fence Gates]] are flipped
**[[Buttons]] are pressed
**[[Levers]] are flipped
**[[Bells]] are rung and swung
**Lit [[Candles]] (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished
*Wind bursts do not have any effect on Iron Doors, Iron Trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a Redstone signal
====Blocks====
'''[[Trial Spawner]]'''
*Trial Spawner is a new variant of [[Monster Spawner]]s that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer
*The challenge level will increase for each new player a Trial Spawner notices nearby
**Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a Trial Spawner's cooldown
*Unlike normal spawners, a Trial Spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level
**It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight
**It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has
**Spawned [[mobs]] are persistent
*Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level
**After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs
*Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in [[Survival]] - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers
*Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with [[Silk Touch]]
*When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default
*The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg
*Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners
====Structures====
'''[[Trial Chambers]]'''
*Trial Chambers are a new structure in the [[Overworld]] where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game
**Trial Chambers are made out of a variety of Copper and Tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small
**Trial Chambers are a relatively common find throughout the Deepslate layer of the underground
*The layout of each Trial Chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, reward chests and a variety of combat spaces
**Supply chests can be found between the different rooms, and give the player blocks and items which help them navigate their trials
**Reward [[chests]] are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of enchanted books and equipment
*Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
**Melee
***[[Zombie]]
***[[Husk]]
***[[Slime]]
**Small Melee
***[[Spider]]
***[[Cave Spider]]
***[[Baby Zombie]]
***[[Silverfish]]
**Ranged
***[[Skeleton]]
***[[Stray]]
*Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber
**For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons
**The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes
====Items====
'''[[Trial Key]]'''
*An item that can only be obtained from Trial Spawners
*Trial Keys do not currently have any functionality
===Changes===
====Blocks====
'''[[Crafter]]'''
*Updated Crafter textures
'''[[Tuff Bricks]]'''
*Updated Tuff Bricks texture
====Technical====
'''Graphical'''
*Improved performance by fixing a GPU resource allocation bug that resulted in constant reallocations every frame in the Deferred Technical Preview
'''[[API]]'''
*PlayerPlaceBlockBeforeEvent
**Removed <code>itemStack: ItemStack</code> from event
**Added <code>readonly permutationBeingPlaced: BlockPermutation</code> to event
**Updating <code>createExplosion(location: Vector3, radius: number, explosionOptions?: ExplosionOptions)</code> to return a boolean. True if the explosion is successful and false if the explosion is unsuccessful or is cancelled.
*Class Player
*Added method <code>spawnParticle(effectName: string, location: Vector3, molangVariables?: MolangVariableMap): void;</code>.
