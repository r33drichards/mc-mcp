'''1.16.2''' is a minor update to {{JE}} released on August 11, 2020.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-16-2|Minecraft 1.16.2|August 11, 2020}}</ref> It adds [[piglin brute]]s and experimental support for custom [[biome]]s. It also updates the [[bartering]] table, and makes minor changes to several other features, such as [[villager]]s and [[nylium]]. On top of that, it fixes a large number of bugs, including some that were added in the [[Village & Pillage]] update.

== Additions ==
{{Additions table|Piglin Brute Spawn Egg Revision 1}}

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Piglin Brute Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Piglin brute spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Piglin Brute.png|32px]] [[Piglin brute]]s'''
* A new stronger variant of [[piglin]]s that wield [[golden axe]]s.
* Are always hostile towards [[player]]s, even when the player is wearing golden armor.
* Have {{hp|50}} health.
* Only spawn during world generation in [[bastion remnant]]s.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added {{cd|mushroom_grow_block}} block tag.
** Contains [[mycelium]], [[podzol]], [[crimson nylium]], and [[warped nylium]].
** Used to determine which blocks [[mushroom]]s can be placed on and which blocks [[huge mushroom]]s can grow on, even if the light level is high.
* Added the {{cd|base_stone_nether}} block tag.
** Contains [[netherrack]], [[basalt]], and [[blackstone]].
** Used to determine what blocks [[ancient debris]] can replace when generated as a [[ore blob]] in the Nether.<!--Only ancient debris-->
* Added the {{cd|base_stone_overworld}} block tag.
** Contains [[stone]], [[granite]], [[diorite]], and [[andesite]].
** Used to determine what blocks [[dirt]], [[gravel]], [[granite]], [[diorite]], [[andesite]], [[coal ore]], [[iron ore]], [[gold ore]], [[redstone ore]], [[diamond ore]], [[lapis lazuli ore]], and [[infested stone]] can replace when generated as ore blobs in the Overworld.
* Added the {{cd|stone_crafting_materials}} item tag.
** Contains [[cobblestone]] and [[blackstone]].
** Used in the {{cd|furnace.json}} [[advancement]] and [[recipe]] files.
** Used in the {{cd|brewing_stand.json}} [[recipe]] file.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|spawnpoint}} and {{cmd|setworldspawn}}'''
* Added an {{cd|angle}} parameter for setting the default facing angle of a respawning [[player]].
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|spawnpoint [<targets>] [<pos>] [<angle>]}}
** {{cmd|setworldspawn [<pos>] [<angle>]}}
*** {{cd|angle}}: Floating point yaw angle in degrees. Supports the relative {{cd|~}} modifier, which defaults to the direction the executing player is facing.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Brewing stand]]'''
* Can now be crafted with [[blackstone]].
** Determined by the {{cd|stone_crafting_materials}} item tag.

'''[[Iron Chain|Chain]]s'''
* Can now be placed in all orientations

'''[[End portal (block)|End portals]]'''
* Now teleport the player centered on the end platform instead of at the north-west corner of the block.

'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* The crafting [[recipe]] and [[recipe book]] unlock now use the {{cd|stone_crafting_materials}} item tag.
** This change is not noticeable in-game as this tag has the same contents as the old {{cd|furnace_materials}} item tag.

'''[[Lantern]]s'''
* Can now be [[waterlogged]].
** Also applies to [[soul lantern]]s.

'''Nether vegetation'''
* No longer catches [[fire]].

'''[[Potted cactus]]'''
* Model now uses a cullface for the top.
* Now no longer has a hole in the bottom.

=== Items ===
'''[[Mushroom|Brown and red mushroom]]'''
* Can now be placed and grown on both types of [[nylium]].

'''[[Nether Fungus|Crimson and warped fungi]]'''
* Can now be placed on [[mycelium]].
** Still only grow into a [[huge fungus]] on the respective [[nylium]].

'''[[Pufferfish (item)|Pufferfish]]'''
* Now gives [[Nausea]] I instead of Nausea II when eaten.
** This has no practical effect in-game as the level of the Nausea effect does not change anything.

'''[[Totem of undying]]'''
* Now gives [[Fire Resistance]] for {{convert|40|seconds}} when activated.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Endermen]]'''
* No longer place their held blocks onto [[bedrock]] blocks.

'''[[Piglin]]s'''
* Become angry with players who open or destroy [[chest minecart]]s and [[hopper minecart]]s.

'''[[Pillager]]s, [[vex]]es and [[vindicator]]s'''
* The attack animations of unarmed pillagers, vexes and vindicators have been changed.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now emit green [[particles]] when joining a [[village]], setting a home [[bed]], or acquiring a [[job site]] or profession to match {{edition|bedrock}}.
* Now lose their job sites when changing dimension.
* They don't get off the [[minecart]] when they change into [[zombie villager]]s and vice versa.

'''[[Zoglin]]s'''
* Can now be [[leash]]ed. However, [[hoglin]]s still break their leash when zombifying.<ref>{{bug|MC-196736}}</ref>

'''[[Suffocation]]'''
* Mobs now suffocate when their head is inside [[soul sand]], [[farmland]], and [[grass path]]s.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Bastion remnant]]s'''
* Now spawn [[piglin brute]]s on world generation.
** Normal [[piglin]]s may still spawn.
* Now have gilded blackstone under most chests.

'''[[Custom]]'''
* Custom worlds now support custom [[biome]]s and custom noise settings.

'''[[Badlands]]'''
* Plateaus generate more frequently at the edges of badlands.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* {{cmd|execute in}} now respects dimension scaling for relative coordinates: the execution position (only the X/Z part) of a command is divided by 8 when traveling from the Overworld to the Nether, and is multiplied by 8 when vice versa.
** If a value is added after the tilde, that value is added only after the new scaled position is calculated. For instance, <code>~5</code> first scales the player's current position (multiplying by eight when traveling to the Overworld or dividing by eight when going to the Nether) before adding five to that outputted value.
** For example, if a player at position {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in Overworld runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp ~ ~ ~}}, the player would now be teleported to {{cd|(2,64,2)}} in the Nether.
*** Relatively, if a player at position {{cd|(2,64,2)}} in the Nether runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:overworld run tp ~ ~ ~}}, the player would now be teleported to {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in Overworld.
*** If a player at position {{cd|(80,64,80)}} in the Overworld runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp ~ ~ ~5}}, the player would now be teleported to {{cd|(10,64,15)}} in the Nether.
*** If a player at position {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in Overworld runs command {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_nether run tp 16 64 16}}, the player would still be teleported to {{cd|(16,64,16)}} in the Nether.
** The behavior before this version can be done by running command {{cmd|execute in <target dimension> positioned as @s run tp @s ~ ~ ~}}.
** Applies to [[custom dimension]]s as well.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[Piglin brute]]s can be killed for the "Monster Hunter" advancement and count toward the "Monsters Hunted" advancement.

'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* [[Tool]]s are now sorted based on their [[tier]] in the Creative inventory.

'''[[Bartering]]'''
* Various weights and item amounts have been changed.
* [[Blackstone]], [[spectral arrow]]s, and [[water bottle]]s can now be obtained through bartering.
* [[Glowstone dust]] and [[magma cream]] can no longer be obtained from bartering.

=== General ===
'''Menu'''
* Dropping [[resource pack]]s into the menu now updates the list of resource packs without needing a reload.
* [[Data pack]]s can now have a <code>[[pack.png]]</code> in the root folder, and display it in the data pack menu.

'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* There is now experimental support for a <code>worldgen</code> folder in data packs.
** <code>worldgen/biome</code> can contain biome definitions.
** <code>worldgen/configured_carver</code> can contain definitions for world carver settings.
** <code>worldgen/configured_feature</code> can contain definitions for feature placements.
** <code>worldgen/configured_structure_feature</code> can contain definitions for structure placements.
** <code>worldgen/configured_surface_builder</code> can contain definitions for surfaces.
** <code>worldgen/noise_settings</code> can contain noise configurations.
** <code>worldgen/processor_list</code> can contain sets of block processors.
** <code>worldgen/template_pool</code> can contain pool definitions for jigsaw structures.
* Custom biomes can now be used in the single biome/caves/floating islands world types after adding the data pack containing the biome first.
* Custom [[biome]]s can now be used in custom [[dimension]] generators.

'''[[Java Edition distance effects|Distance effects]]'''
* [[Ore blob]]s now no longer use 32-bit floats, causing them to generate in the correct shape regardless of position in the world and preventing a crash that could occur if the world border was moved out further via [[mods]].

'''GPU warnlist'''
* The GPU warnlist has been changed to no longer explicitly warn against Mesa and Gallium renderers and X.Org vendors, but instead just warn against anything with a version below 3.0.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
{{Resource pack format/value|6}}

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Dedicated servers can now rate limit clients.
** Dedicated servers can now kick clients that consistently send too many packets within a second.
** Controlled with the <code>rate-limit</code> settings in <code>[[server.properties]]</code>.
** The default rate limit of 0 means "no limit".

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed the {{cd|furnace_materials}} item tag.

'''World creation'''
* Changed the description of the {{cd|doDaylightCycle}} [[gamerule]] from "Advance in-game time" to "Advance time of day".
