'''CyberSafe: Home Sweet Hmm''' is a {{EE}} map developed by Cleverlike Studios<ref>{{Cite|url=https://www.cleverlike.com/cybersafe-homesweethmm|title=Online Safety Experience Created for Microsoft|website=cleverlike.com}}</ref>, designed to teach responsibility in online spaces<ref>{{Cite|url=https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/lessons/cybersafe-home-sweet-hmm|title=Cyber Safe: Home Sweet Hmm|author=Minecraft Education|website=education.minecraft.net|date=February 7, 2022}}</ref>. It can also be played through the [[Marketplace]].

== Summary ==
=== Zombie ===
The map opens inside a house, with the player facing an [[NPC]], "your trusted adult." Upon moving, a title card will appear, and the player will be free to explore the building. Immediately visible is a purple [[carpet]], [[candles]], a [[flower pot]], and [[iron door]]. Behind the player's range is a couch and TV, represented by [[stairs]] and [[black stained glass pane]]s. Next to them is a kitchen, with a [[crafting table]], [[furnace]], [[polished diorite]] stairs, [[cauldron]], [[brewing stand]], [[cartography table]], and [[creeper head]]. {{control|Interacting}} with the Trusted Adult will introduce them, and cite the moral of the map.

Suddenly, a knock is heard at the door, noted by another text on the screen. Approaching the door reveals it to be a [[zombie]], which your Trusted Adult insists we shouldn't open the door for. The player is given a choice between opening the door and not opening the door, the latter being the correct answer to the solution, visualized by an [[iron golem]] appearing to deal with the lurking zombie. 

=== Friend Manager ===
After the zombie is killed in real time, your Trusted Adult notices a notification on a computer, located behind the TV in a bedroom area, with two [[beds]], [[allium]], and [[end rod]] lamp. {{Control|Interacting}} with the computer will reveal it's an invitation to play on a ''Minecraft'' [[server]].

Reading the message will establish the message is from "MineGamer1212," actually a friend named Hayden from school. They want to play "this cool new game with you," which the player needs permission to join in on. Your Trusted Adult agrees, but stresses to pay attention to usernames. Continuing from there will teleport the player into a [[minecart]], descending down a surrealist tunnel into an abstract representation of ''Minecraft'', with [[lime concrete]] walls, regal [[quartz]] ceiling decorations, and a stack of [[chests]] and [[enchanting table]] in the corner. At the end of the room is the "Friend Manager" NPC, a physical manifestation of a friend list.

The Friend Manager informs the player that they have four friend requests: MineCrafter12, MineGamer21, MineGamer1212, and KidGamer1212. The player is tasked with identifying which is Hayden, proceeding into a route made of [[blocks of diamond]], [[iron bars]], and [[mycelium]] if they guess the wrong answer, meeting a character referred to as "$#%&!". The player instead proceeds into a [[netherrack]] and [[gray glazed terracotta]] area if they get it correct before riding into a large build of an Xbox controller. The ride ends with the player emerging in a [[windswept hills]] overgrown with [[tall grass]], where they ask the player to play a "new parkour challenge," which happens to be right in front of them. Regardless of whether the player reaches the end, Hayden will eventually have to leave, returning the player to the house.

=== Maze Game ===
Near immediately after returning home, another notification is heard coming from the computer. It's again from Hayden, asking for the player to try out "this super cool new maze online!" In spite of its difficulty, they expect the player to be able to beat a high score. Your Trusted Adult allows the player to continue, but now stresses not to give away personal information. Returning to the digital pit, the player is now sent into a room walled with [[sea lanterns]], covered in [[leaves]] with a floor made of [[green stained glass]] and [[jungle wood]]. On the side of the room is an NPC named Pro Gamer, who laments the difficulty of the aforementioned maze and offers to give a "cheat code" that somehow gives access to [[creative mode]]. 

Once again, your Trusted Adult will chime in to instruct the player to make the right choice. In this case, saying no to a request from Pro Gamer to take the player's password. If the player says yes, they will be sent into a dingy, train station-like room filled with leaves  and lined with [[redstone torches]], where a Security character will lament that the player's account has been hacked and task them to "search this area to recover all of [their] personal information." These are represented by [[paper]] scattered across the area, which include a password, full name, date of birth, phone number, home address, and email address. Upon collecting the personal information, the player is sent back to Pro Gamer and can make the correct choice.

Making the right choice will send the player to the Maze Game, which is set inside a maze of [[jungle leaves]]. Players can attempt to walk over the top of the maze, but will be stopped by a [[sign]] and [[barrier]]. Following a trail of [[cornflower]]s, the player can meet the Maze Builder, who apologizes for the difficulty but seems impressed by the player's time. 

=== MineMart ===
After completing the maze, the player returns home again, where your Trusted Adult will reveal they got an email from "MineMart." It is revealed they ordered [[armor]], which they suggest the player checks before dinner. Returning to the computer, however, reveals that something went wrong with the order, which sends the player into a digital store in front of three [[armor stands]]. At a nearby desk is the "Minemart Helper," who explains the situation.

The MineMart corporation has had difficulty identifying the precise set of armor desired by the player, the Helper requesting to access the player's account and login information. Your Trusted Adult returns to say "Hmm," and nearby armor stands explain the truth, with the closest armor being [[leather armor]] colored like [[iron armor]]. Saying no confirms the Helper to be the perpetrator of a phishing scheme. Instead of supporting the Helper, the player is sent over to MineMart itself, in the real world. Saying Yes will send the player to the house but with the sky replaced with blue concrete. With nine patches of [[Sunflower|sunflowers]]. Talking to Trusted Adult triggers the fishy scene filled with [[Cod|cods]], [[salmon]] and [[Tropical Fish|tropical fish]]. But fish in there are bad. After talking to Trusted Adult again you'll be sent back to try to choose the right one.

Approaching the MineMart Employee by a warehouse, who immediately helps with the order. In fact, they reveal there is no problem, and in fact is loaded in the truck they were driving. Checking the back of the truck will reveal [[emerald]] armor, being shipped to the house very soon. 

=== Jungle Market ===
Returning home, your Trusted Adult will stress how important it is to not share account information, but then remember to buy a [[pumpkin pie]] from the "[[Jungle]] Market," which for unexplained reasons is something the player must act out.

Using a search engine on the computer sends the player to a representation of an online search, with 5 emeralds in their inventory. Several NPCs surround the player, including ''Specialty Pie Co.'', ''Pie There! Online Bakery'', ''Pies'R'Us'', ''Pie in the Sky'', ''Arrrrrrr! PIE-rates Bakery'', Jungle Market, and ''Tropical Shop''. Jungle Market's [[name tag]] is colored pink, so it is easy to identify. Every other store, in blue, will send the player into another dingy environment, this time resembling a farmer's market, with [[grass]] flooring, and [[acacia planks]] stands selling items including  [[lily pad]]s, [[coal]], [[wither rose]]s, [[dead bush]]es, [[pumpkin seeds]], [[wheat]], [[raw cod]], [[raw salmon]], and [[cobwebs]]. At the end is a Shopkeeper, who will ask if the player wants their emeralds back, agreeing to return them if they can find all five, by pressing a [[button]].

If the correct button is pressed, the player can return to the search and correct their mistake. Buying from the Jungle Market NPC will send the player to a physical Jungle Market, where a Pie Baker will explain that they are working on the pie as they speak. The player is given the option to either find the ingredients themselves or wait for it to be made by the staff. If the player declines to help, they will be able to simply buy the pie.

If the player chooses to find the ingredients, they will have to find them in several chests across a large environment. The closest is in a chest by a [[wheat seeds|wheat field]] in front of the bakery, holding three wheat. The second is very closely by, but obscured by [[sugar canes]], holding three [[sugar]]s. The third closest is in another field of similar positioning, only with the chest (containing three wheat) on the far end. The fourth is beside a pen outside a house, identifiable by [[pumpkin]]s inside and a [[stripped logs|stripped jungle]] exterior, containing three more sugar. The fifth is inside the pen itself, holding [[cocoa beans]]. The sixth is at the end of an expansive pumpkin farm, holding three more cocoa beans. After all the ingredients are found, the player returns home, your Trusted Adult thanking the player.

Suddenly, your Trusted Adult will reveal the armor has arrived outside, the door finally opening. Exiting the house, the player will find all the various helpful NPCs of the map surrounding the premises, alongside a floating certificate and two additional NPCs, ''Xbox Family Settings'' and ''Xbox Family Safety app''. The ultimate reward for the map are the certificate (which can be downloaded), and emerald armor.

== Trivia ==
* A common motif of the mob is using a villager's mumble (consistently referred to as a capitalized "Hmm") as a motto for the message of staying safe online. 
**In the player's house, a sign is hung above the entrance saying "Home Sweet Hmmm," and close to that is an end table with a sign saying "Home is Where the Hmm is." 
**When meeting antagonists, your Trusted Adult pops in to say they "like to say Hmm when [they're] making a choice."
* Due to the narrative of the map involving ''Minecraft'', it is one of several works to serve as [[w:metafiction|metafiction]]. Unlike other similar stories, like [[The Crash]] and [[The Haven Trials]], ''Minecraft'' characters such as [[villagers]] are shown coexisting with ''Minecraft'' the game.
* Antagonists within the map are consistently shown speaking in poetry, the exception being the Helper, possibly to make them easier to deceive younger players.
* Jungle Market and Pie Baker share a texture.
* On the computer is a {{Wikipedia|Windows 7}} background. Specifically, the default wallpaper, ''img0'' or ''Harmony''.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://windowswallpaper.miraheze.org/wiki/Harmony|title=Harmony|website=Windows Wallpaper Wiki}}</ref>
