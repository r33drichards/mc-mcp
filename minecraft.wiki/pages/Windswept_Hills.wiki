'''Windswept hills''' or '''extreme hills''' are cold mountainous biomes with shattered terrain covered by grass blocks and stone. Windswept hills generate in areas with high erosion close to [[swamp]]s, often bordering their [[Windswept Forest|wooded]] and [[Windswept Gravelly Hills|gravelly]] variants.

== Description ==
Windswept hills generate in areas with high [[Biome#Erosion|erosion]], high [[Biome#Weirdness|PV]] and high [[continentalness]]. The terrain is usually flat, but sometimes hilly and shattered. They generally peak at roughly Y-level 140. Above Y=120±8, rainfall changes to [[snowfall]], and the hills becomes snow-capped, along with [[water]] freezing into [[ice]]. Despite windswept hill biomes being highland biomes, [[deep dark]] doesn't generate under windswept hills biomes. 

The [[grass]] and [[leaves]] are an aqua color. These are the only biomes, besides [[mountain]] biomes, where [[emerald ore]] is found. Like [[mountain]]s, [[infested block]]s with [[silverfish]] can be generated underground below the sea level. [[Oak]] [[tree]]s and [[spruce]] trees occasionally generate here, with a bit of [[grass]], [[poppies]], [[dandelion]]s and [[bush|bushes]] on the ground. [[Llama]]s can spawn in these biomes.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], windswept hills use default environmental settings with a coolish color grading, making the biome appear colder blue.

[[Survival]] in windswept hills can be challenging to beginners, due to the heights often risking heavy fall damage and higher elevations bringing snow and ice, but can be fairly easy once the player has acclimated to the area and found or made a flat-enough space for shelter. [[Llama]]s can also serve as useful pack animals when tamed. [[Water]] must be protected by light or a roof to prevent it from freezing when above the [[Biome#Precipitation|snowfall line]], however, and the [[player]] must be aware of their surroundings to avoid falling off steep cliffs, especially when fighting [[hostile mob]]s. Care should also be taken when mining in windswept hills, due to infested stone occasionally generating; the player might get swarmed with silverfish if they're not prepared.
