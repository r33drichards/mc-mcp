'''Hanging roots''' are a natural decorative block found underground in the [[lush caves]] biome.

== Obtaining ==
[[File:Azalea Tree with Roots.png|thumb|right|upright|The hanging roots generated along with the [[azalea tree]].]]

=== Breaking ===
Hanging roots can be destroyed with any tool or by hand instantly, but can only be collected using [[shears]]. {{IN|be}}, any [[Silk Touch]] tool also works.
{{breaking row|Hanging roots|horizontal=1|None|shears=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Hanging roots can generate inside a [[lush cave]] beneath an [[azalea tree]] on the surface above.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
Using [[bone meal]] on [[rooted dirt]] causes hanging roots to grow below the block.

Hanging roots may be obtained by using a [[hoe]] on rooted dirt, transforming the rooted dirt into normal [[dirt]] in the process.

== Usage ==
Hanging roots can only be placed on the underside of a block.

=== Composting ===
Placing hanging roots into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
