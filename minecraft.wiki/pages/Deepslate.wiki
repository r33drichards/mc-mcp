'''Deepslate''' is a [[Stone (disambiguation)|stone]] type found deep underground in the [[Overworld]] that functions similarly to regular [[stone]], but takes significantly longer to mine.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Deepslate can only be obtained by mining it using a [[pickaxe]] with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment, otherwise it drops [[cobbled deepslate]]. If broken with any other tool, it drops nothing. The breaking time for deepslate is twice the time for [[stone]].

{{breaking row|Deepslate|Pickaxe|Wood|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Deepslate makes up the majority of the solid [[block]]s generated below Y=0 in the [[Overworld]]. [[Stone]] is gradually replaced from Y=8 to Y=0 until it is completely replaced by deepslate.

Deepslate also generates in [[Ancient City|ancient cities]].

=== Generated loot ===
On <code>ancient_city/city_center/city_center_2</code>, a furnace can generate with 24 deepslate inside of it.

=== Smelting ===
Deepslate can be smelted from [[Cobbled Deepslate|cobbled deepslate]].

|Deepslate

|foot=1
}}

=== Post-generation ===
If a world generated before [[Caves & Cliffs]]: Part II is loaded after the update, the [[bedrock]] layer between Y=0 and Y=4 is replaced with deepslate.

== Usage ==
Deepslate can be placed in three orientations, similarly to [[log]]s. [[Silverfish]] can enter and hide in deepslate, creating an [[infested block]].

=== Note blocks ===
Deepslate can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sound.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* According to [[Brandon Pearce]], the reason for changing the name "grimstone" to "deepslate" was because the word "grim" had too many connotations related to a negative feeling and therefore did not accurately describe the block as to what it actually was. The name "deepslate" was eventually chosen because of its location within the world and to more accurately represent that it is a type of slate.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1367445839011004428|The reason is that we felt the name "Grim" had too many connotations to a feeling rather than describing what it is. Generally, we don't enforce feelings, as they should be up to player interpretation|March 4, 2021}}</ref>
* Similar to [[stone]], the orientation of the texture varies depending on the coordinates.
