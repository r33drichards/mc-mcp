== Additions ==

* Added [[camel husk]] and [[parched]] spawn eggs.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Camel_Husk_JE1.png|32px]] '''[[Camel husk]]'''
* New [[undead]] variant of the [[camel]].
* Spawns at a light level of 0 in [[desert]]s.

** Does not spawn in [[caves]], following the husk's spawning rules.

* Despawns like other hostile mobs, but becomes persistent while [[ridden]] by a player.
* Favorite food is [[rabbit foot]], but it cannot be [[bred]].
* Drops 2-3 [[rotten flesh]] when killed, with an extra 0-1 for each level of [[Looting]].
** Any husk riding it now has a chance of dropping a [[rabbit foot]] on death.
* As a mount, it works similar to a normal [[camel]].

[[File:Parched JE1 BE1.png|32px]] '''[[Parched]]'''
* New variant of the [[skeleton]].
* Spawns at a light level of 0 in deserts replacing some of the regular skeletons.
** Does not spawn in caves, following the [[husk]]'s spawning rules.
* Does not burn in sunlight.
* Has {{hp|16}} health.
* Shoots [[arrows of Weakness]], and has a chance to drop them as well.
* Has a slower rate of fire compared to a normal skeleton, similar to the [[bogged]].

=== General ===
'''[[Environment attribute]]s'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:visual/water_fog_start_distance}}
** The distance in blocks from the camera at which underwater fog starts to have an effect. If negative, the fog will start out with density as if it had started that many blocks behind the camera.
*** Value type: float

*** Modifiers: Float Modifiers
*** Interpolated: yes
*** Resolved at the camera's position

* Added {{cd|minecraft:visual/fog_start_distance}}
** The distance in blocks from the camera at which fog starts to have an effect (when the camera is not submerged in another substance). If negative, the fog will start out with density as if it had started that many blocks behind the camera. Note: the final value is also modified by weather.
*** Value type: float
*** Default value: {{cd|0.0}}
*** Modifiers: Float Modifiers
*** Interpolated: yes
*** Resolved at the camera's position.

* Added {{cd|minecraft:visual/fog_end_distance}}
** The distance in blocks from the camera at which fog reaches its maximum density (when the camera is not submerged in another substance).

*** Modifiers: Float Modifiers
*** Interpolated: yes
*** Resolved at the camera's position.

*** Interpolated: yes
*** Resolved at the camera's position for rendering, or at the position of a [[happy ghast]] for regeneration.

'''[[Game rule]]s'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:fire_spread_radius_around_player}}
** Controls the maximum distance in blocks that fire can spread around a player.
*** This replaces the previous {{cd|doFireTick}} and {{cd|allowFireTicksAwayFromPlayer}} game rules, which have now been removed.
*** Setting it to {{cd|0}} will disable fire spreading.
*** Setting it to {{cd|-1}} will allow fire spreading without players around.
*** Limit: Minimum {{cd|-1}}

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added the anisotropic filtering graphics option.

** The default depends on the graphics preset, and the values are "off", "2x", "4x", and "8x".
** If the hardware does not support it, it will not be used.
** This significantly impacts video memory usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count).

* Added the chunk fade time option.
** Located in Video Settings.
** Controls the fade-in time of [[chunk]]s.

'''[[Slot Sources]]'''
* Added slot sources to allow the location of any inventory slot to be specified within datapacks.

*** {{cd|type}}: the slot source type.
*** {{cd|<type-specific>}}: additional fields depending on the type.

* {{cd|minecraft:empty}} Type
** Empty selection containing no slots.

* {{cd|minecraft:group}} Type
** Merges several slot sources into one, with the resulting selection containing all slots from each slot source provided.
*** If a slot is included in more than one slot source, it will be repeated in the resulting slot source.
*** e.g. {{cd|[a, b] + [c, a]}} -> {{cd|[a, b, c, a]}}
** Format:
*** {{cd|terms}}: list of slot sources to join.
** Can alternatively be written inline as a list of slot sources.

* {{cd|minecraft:slot_range}} Type
** Selects slots within a slot range from the inventory of an entity or block entity.

**** Can be {{cd|block_entity}}, this, {{cd|attacking_entity}}, {{cd|last_damage_player}}, {{cd|direct_attacker}}, {{cd|target_entity}}, or {{cd|interacting_entity}}
*** {{cd|slots}}: a slot range in the format of {{cd|<slot_type>}} or {{cd|<slot_type>.<slot_number>}} (e.g. {{cd|armor.chest}} or {{cd|container.*}}).

* {{cd|minecraft:contents}} Type
** Selects all non-empty slots from the inventory component of one or more items.
*** If no item is stored inside that component, the resulting selection will be empty.
** The location of the item(s) whose inventory component to use is specified by another slot source.
*** If the slot source includes more than one item with that component, the resulting selections will be merged identically as with the {{cd|minecraft:group}} type.
*** e.g. {{cd|Bundle [a, b] + Shulker Box [c, d]}} -> {{cd|[a, b, c, d]}}
** Format:
*** {{cd|component}}: the inventory component to target.
**** Allowed values are {{cd|minecraft:bundle_contents}}, {{cd|minecraft:charged_projectiles}}, and {{cd|minecraft:container}}
*** {{cd|slot_source}}: a slot source containing slots with item(s) to target.

* {{cd|minecraft:filtered}} Type
** Applies a filter to the selected slots, excluding any non-matching slots from the resulting selection.
** Format:
*** {{cd|item_filter}}: an item predicate to match against the items in each slot.
*** {{cd|slot_source}}: the slot source to filter.

* {{cd|minecraft:limit_slots}} Type
** Limits the number of slots provided, with the resulting selection containing at most that number of slots.
*** Any slots bringing the number of slots above that limit will be excluded, in order of inclusion.
*** e.g. {{cd|[a, b, c, d]}} -> {{cd|[a, b, c]}} if the limit is set to {{cd|3}}
** Format:
*** {{cd|limit}}: integer, the maximum number of slots to include in the resulting selection.
*** {{cd|slot_source}}: the slot source to limit.
* Example slot source selecting every slot with more than 16 items from the hotbar and armor slots of an entity:
<syntaxhighlight lang="json">{
    "type": "minecraft:filtered",
    "item_filter": {
        "count": {
            "min": 16
