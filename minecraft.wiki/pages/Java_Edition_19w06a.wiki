'''19w06a''' is the twentieth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on February 6, 2019,<ref>{{snap|19w06a|February 6, 2019}}</ref> which adds a new startup screen.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''General'''
* Added a new tag for item forms of blocks called <code>BlockStateTag</code>.
** Formatted as <code>{BlockStateTag:{''state'':"''value''",''state2'':"''value2''",''stateN'':"''valueN''"}}</code>.
** Does not affect item model.

=== General ===
'''Startup screen'''
* Added a loading bar to the startup screen.
** Once loading is complete the startup screen now fades into the main menu.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cartography table]]s'''
* Added sounds for the block.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Wandering trader]]s'''
* Now drink [[potions of Invisibility]] at night.
** When day comes, they drink [[milk]] to clear the potion effect.
* Now have a <code>WanderTarget</code> data tag containing a block position. When set, they pathfind to that position.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Jungle pyramid]]s '''
* Now spawn in {{BiomeLink|Bamboo Jungle|text=bamboo jungles}}.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Improved village blacksmith building generation to prevent them from catching on fire from lava inside them.
** Desert blacksmith buildings have been removed.

=== General ===
'''[[LWJGL]]'''
* Updated to 3.2.1.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Are now broken up into individual textures files per frame rather than being in <code>particles.png</code>.
** Do not use <code>.mcmeta</code> files for their animation – those are still hard-coded.

'''Performance'''
* Slightly improved startup time.
