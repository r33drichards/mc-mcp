'''Jungle trees''' are [[feature]]s native to the [[jungle]] biome. Jungle trees range from short bushes to tall trees that reach up to 31 blocks in height. Their wood is of a pale brownish color.

The [[jungle bush]] is a variant of the jungle tree that is short and generates along the floor of jungles.

== Appearance ==
Jungle trees come in several different variants with different properties:
* Regular jungle trees are short, lack branches, and have a 1×1 trunk. The [[leaves]] of these trees are arranged the same way as the [[Birch#Leaf arrangement|birch tree leaf arrangement]]. [[Cocoa pod]]s occasionally generate on the sides of regular jungle trees.
* Mega jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six [[log]]s. The trunk covers a 2×2 space on the ground.

== Generation ==
The jungle tree variants generate naturally in the indicated biomes:

|{{BiomeLink|Sparse Jungle}}||{{tc|yes}}||{{tc|no}}
|}

A large jungle tree always generates with [[dirt]] under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over [[air]] or [[water]] blocks.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from jungle trees:
* {{BlockLink|Jungle Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Jungle Leaves}} (harvested with shears, or a Silk Touch tool)
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Jungle Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Vines}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Jungle Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Jungle Sapling}} (low chance of dropping when breaking leaves)

When jungle tree leaves decay or are destroyed, a jungle sapling drops 2.5% ({{frac|1|40}}) of the time – half the chance of other tree leaves.

== Planting ==
Jungle tree [[sapling]]s can be planted on:
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}

[[File:Jungletree growth.png|thumb|left|This jungle tree cannot grow because of the red wool block (looking from the northwestern corner)]]

When planted in grass or dirt, a jungle sapling grows into a jungle tree with a 1×1 trunk, but the [[player]] can place saplings in a 2×2 formation and they grow into a jungle tree with the 2×2 trunk found naturally in the jungle biome.

1×1 jungle trees require a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 5 blocks above the sapling to grow (6 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, 1×1 jungle trees require 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep still grows).

In order to grow a 2×2 jungle tree, four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. [[Bone meal]] can be used on any of the saplings to accelerate growth.

2×2 jungle trees require a 5×5 column of unobstructed space at least 11 blocks above the saplings to grow (12 blocks including the saplings themselves). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. A 3×3 area is required at the base of the tree (the level of the saplings). They can grow up to 32 blocks high.

If planted by the player, 1×1 jungle trees do not generate with vines, while 2×2 jungle trees do. 2×2 jungle trees cannot grow side by side because the vines break the space clearance requirement.

== Other jungle tree variants ==
Jungle trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143349/http://i.imgur.com/hTg0N8J.gifv</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-21304}}</ref>

=== Fallen jungle trees ===
{{main|Fallen tree}}
[[File:Jungle Fallen Log.png|200px|A fallen jungle tree log.]]

A fallen jungle tree may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have mushrooms on top.

A fallen jungle tree has a log length of 4–11 blocks. Vines cover 75% of the stump.

=== Dying jungle trees ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Dying Trees.jpg|thumb|The different dying tree types.]]
A dying jungle tree has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, although all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with [[vines]].
{{-}}

== Foliage colors ==
{{main|Tint#Foliage}}
Depending on where the tree generates, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, a jungle tree's leaves are normally bright deep green in the jungle, but they have a beige tint in badlands biomes.

Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.
