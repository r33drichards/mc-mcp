== Trivia ==
* On April 1, 2018, all textures in 1.12.2 were temporarily replaced – they were changed to include a smaller range of colors, falsely told to be the [[Texture Update|new textures]] previously announced (as a joke for April Fools).<ref>{{Mcnet|java-edition-textures-finally-perfected|Java Edition Textures Finally Perfected!|April 1, 2018}}</ref>
* This is the last full release to use the panoramic background from [[Beta 1.8]], as all of the subsequent updates had backgrounds related to the theme of the respective update.
* This release holds the record of serving as the latest release of ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' for the longest time, at 303 days between its release on September 18, 2017 and the release of [[Java Edition 1.13]] on July 18, 2018.
** The previous record of serving as the latest release of ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' for the longest time was held by [[Java Edition 1.11.2|1.11.2]] (168 days).
* This is the last version using numeric IDs, as ''[[Java Edition 1.13/Flattening|The Flattening]]'' was implemented in [[Java Edition 1.13]].
* This version was released exactly seven years after [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.1|Alpha v1.1.1]] and [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2|Alpha v1.1.2]].
