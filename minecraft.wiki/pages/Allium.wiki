An '''allium''' is a [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[magenta dye]] and [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
An allium can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

An allium also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Allium|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Alliums generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[flower forest]] and [[meadow]] biomes as part of [[Flower#Flower gradients|gradients]].

Potted alliums can also be found in [[woodland mansion]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a flower forest, and a meadow {{in|java}}, alliums have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area {{in|java}}, or a 7×5×7 area {{in|bedrock}}. Whether alliums can generate depends on the flower gradients.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, when [[bone meal]] is applied to an allium in any biome, more alliums appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up alliums, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Generated loot ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, eight alliums are found inside the chest in the [[Woodland Mansion#Main and secret rooms|"allium room"]] in woodland mansions. A bug causes this room not to generate {{in|java}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-240121}}</ref>

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell an allium for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, alliums can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Alliums can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using an allium imparts the {{EffectLink|Fire Resistance}} effect for 3 seconds. It can be crafted using an allium or produced by feeding an allium to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s will attempt to collect nectar from alliums, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Alliums can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of an allium have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing an allium into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of alliums yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
