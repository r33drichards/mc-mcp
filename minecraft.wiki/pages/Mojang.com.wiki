'''Mojang.com''' was [[Mojang Studios]]' official website, containing a blog and information hub about their games as well as merchandise produced by J!NX. The website served as an official outlet for updates regarding ''[[Minecraft]]'' until December 4, 2016,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017113702/https://www.mojang.com/2016/12/shouldnt-you-be-on-minecraftnet-right-now/|title=Shouldn't you be on Minecraft.net right now?|author=Owen Jones|date=December 4, 2016|website=Mojang.com}}</ref> after which [[Minecraft.net]] was made the official source of ''Minecraft'' news. Since the announcement of the move to Minecraft.net, no further posts have been made to the site. All pages on Mojang.com now redirect to Minecraft.net since October 2020.<ref>{{bug|WEB-1306|||Works as Intended}}</ref>

Previously, the site was largely a placeholder, with a short biography and links to [[Notch]]'s other game projects. Around the same time as the new [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] logo was put in place, it was transformed into a full site to showcase the company. The site was run by [[Jeb]], [[Carl]] and [[Kappische]].{{more info|Give exact dates and expand on its history}}

== Trivia ==
* Although the main site redirects to [[minecraft.net]], the [[bug tracker]] is still hosted at bugs.mojang.com, rather than using minecraft.net.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://bugs.mojang.com/|title=Mojira - Home|author=[[Mojang Studios]]|website=[[Mojira]]}}</ref>
