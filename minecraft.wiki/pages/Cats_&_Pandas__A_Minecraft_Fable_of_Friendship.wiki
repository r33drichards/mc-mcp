== Summary ==
The video begins with a narrator recounting several [[Cat|cats]] and [[Panda|pandas]] sleeping in a [[Sparse Jungle|sparse jungle]] [[biome]]. The leaders of two tribes (the [[Bamboo Jungle|Bamboo Forest]] and the "Meh, Whatever" tribe) are fast asleep in a contest, the winner claiming the [[jungle]] while the other is banished to the [[Kelp (feature)|ocean]]. The rivals had slept for "an extraordinarily long time," with the pandas ultimately winning. The cats, furious, accused the pandas of hibernating instead of sleeping, instigating a feud that would persist for many centuries.

Over the years, the two kept their distance, the pandas ruling over the jungle biomes, while cats spent the centuries "meandering in [[Village|alleyways]], starring in internet videos, and sneaking into places disguised as [[Ocelot|ocelots]]." As their hatred grew and grew, the two animals became increasingly beloved among humans, with several suggesting pandas be added to ''Minecraft''. The video then pivots to the office of a "Cat-and-Panda Expert," who offers several puns. 

Returning to the conflict, it is established that there were many summits held over the feud, however few could ever come to an agreement. This culminated in a summit in {{Wikipedia|Winnipeg}}, the "Paws and Claws Summit." Tensions were high, so high that they nearly reverted to fighting, until suddenly a [[Mojang Studios]] employee appeared outdoors and pitched them ''[[Minecraft]]''. The two clans were finally on speaking terms, making sounds they hadn't made in hundreds of years, agreeing to peace because of the existence of ''Minecraft''.

In the final seconds of the video, the camera pans out of the set, revealing the Paws and Claws Summit to be nothing more than a [[Planks|box]] in the biome the feud began, as a cat and panda hold up a [[sign]] promising they'll come to the game.

{{Quote|A nap-off gone wrong leaves cat and panda relations in shambles. After many failed attempts at peace, the two sides find common ground.
When they’re not sneezing or snacking on bamboo, pandas can be found rolling around the jungle. Cats are curious but kind, chasing other mobs and bringing "gifts" to their masters. And of course, both lounge and laze as they please.

== Trivia ==

* Several of the puppets are actually modified ''Mattel'' [[action figures]], most noticeable during [[Steve]] and [[Alex]]'s cameo.
* The claim that cats pose as ocelots is a reference, if not explanation, for older versions of the game where the two were one and the same. Instead of [[taming]] an ocelot, taming it would transform it into a cat. This factors into the supposed feud with pandas; once it was resolved, there would be no reason to sneak into the jungles, they could just go inside.
