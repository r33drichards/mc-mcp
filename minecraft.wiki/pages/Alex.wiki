== Trivia ==
[[File:Minecraft_2012_Promotional_Artwork.png|right|thumb|240px|An Alex-like character (pictured here second from the left, holding a pickaxe) can be seen in early promotional artwork for ''Minecraft''.]]
*The Alex skin closely resembles a character featured in promotional artwork for ''Minecraft'', which was used starting in 2011. Both the Alex skin and the unnamed character are shown with long orange hair, a 1x2 "standard" mouth, green eyes, and a green shirt.
* In "The History of Minecraft Skins" on ''Minecraft'''s official [[YouTube]] channel, [[Jens Bergensten]] says he "took inspiration" from his own appearance for Alex so he could take the blame for negative feedback on the skin.<ref>{{YouTube link|qIrmhRHuW08|The History of Minecraft Skins|Minecraft|November 30, 2022|name=The History of Minecraft Skins}}</ref>
* The July–August 2016 issue of ''{{Wikipedia|Lego Club Magazine}}'' mentioned that Steve is Alex's boyfriend. In the issue after, they corrected themselves stating that Steve and Alex are "Just good friends." 
** It is also mentioned that Steve is a miner, builder, and alchemist, while Alex is a builder, explorer, and hunter.
* The Alex skin is implied to be female in the description of a video from ''Minecraft'''s official YouTube channel, though never said outright through the use of pronouns or other methods.<ref>{{ytl|8jI4Qfj7U6Q|Making Mobs: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|Minecraft|December 27, 2019|December 27, 2019|channelid=UC1sELGmy5jp5fQUugmuYlXQ}}</ref>
** The official ''Minecraft'' Instagram account has used gendered pronouns to describe Steve and Alex occasionally.<ref>{{Cite Instagram|Minecraft|BxBD-T2AtoX|Steve couldn’t sleep, despite being safe in his hastily constructed dirt house. The sound of clattering bones and zombie groaning was just too intense.|May 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Instagram|Minecraft|BzQYlarn0Do|Marching right into a Pillager Outpost may have seemed like a bad idea, but Alex had her favourite bow and an arrow ready to fly.

**The official ''Minecraft'' Twitter account also used female pronouns to describe Alex.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1879213536385355870|She's so crazzzzzzzy! Love her!!!|January 14, 2025}}</ref>
** In the moveset explanation video regarding their inclusion in ''{{w|Super Smash Bros. Ultimate}}'', ''Mr. Sakurai Presents "Steve & Alex"'', the English subtitles referred to Steve and Alex with male and female pronouns respectively, although because Japanese omits pronouns, Masahiro Sakurai didn't use any gendered pronouns to refer to them.<ref>{{YouTube link|_Sp5o1JJdDk|Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Mr. Sakurai Presents "Steve & Alex"|Nintendo of America|October 3, 2020}}</ref>
** The [https://youtu.be/Sq2vzQkzn9I audio description] for [[Caves & Cliffs Update: Part I – Official Trailer]] also refers to Steve and Alex as a "(bearded) man" and "woman" respectively.
** According to a 2012 Tumblr post, [[Markus Persson|Notch]] states that Steve and all other mobs are genderless.<ref>[http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft]{{Tumblr|notch|28188312756|Gender in Minecraft|July 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728170757/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft}}</ref><ref>{{Cite|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-creator-of-minecraft-reveals-that-his-game-occupies-a-genderless-world-2012-7|title=The Creator Of 'Minecraft' Reveals That His Game Occupies A Genderless World|author=Ana Douglas|website=Business Insider|date=July 30, 2012}}</ref> Similarly, [[Lydia Winters]] tends to avoid using gendered typecasting as a way of making ''Minecraft'' accessible to everyone, saying that she wouldn’t approve descriptions of [[Steve]] and Alex if they weren’t gender neutral.<ref name="PopSugarInterview3">[https://www.popsugar.com/news/Lydia-Winters-Mojang-Brand-Director-Minecraft-Interview-44228973 The Incredible True Story of How a Florida Teacher Became Head of 1 of the Biggest Brands on Earth] - PopSugar; November 17, 2017</ref>
*Alex appears to be depicted as being left-handed in most official artwork depicting the character.
*During [[PEZ THE MIC|''PEZ THE MIC'']], an infomercial-style commercial for a collaboration with {{Wikipedia|PEZ}}, Alex is described as being "full of pride."
