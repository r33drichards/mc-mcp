=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s and [[bogged]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include boots. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the boots they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped boots are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

== Usage ==
Boots can be placed in the fourth armor slot of a player's [[inventory]] for activation.

=== Statistics ===
Each armor point reduces damage by 4% (increasing additively). Armor points are signified by half a shirt on the armor bar above the health bar. The effectiveness of armor points is decreased as the strength of incoming attacks increase, an effect lessened by armor toughness. Armor toughness does not have a visual indicator bar. Boots durability is decreased by 1 for every {{hp|4}} of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). Different boots types have different enchantability from one another, a value that affects the strength of enchantments received directly though [[enchanting table]]s. Netherite boots provide a knockback resistance of 1 (10%).

Boots can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding units of the [[tiers]]' repair material, with each repair material restoring 25% the boots' maximum durability, rounded down. Two boots of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the boots' [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
Boots can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a pair of boots, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the [[armor]].
