The '''Enchanted Ender Eyes''' or '''Enchanted Eyes of Ender''' a set of six enchanted [[Eye of Ender|eyes of ender]], pivotal to the second season of [[Minecraft Mini-Series]].

== Appearance ==
Enchanted Ender Eyes look like their non-enchanted versions before [[Texture Update]].

== Properties ==
They don't do anything on their own, but collecting all 6 enchanted eyes and placing them in a circle will open a [[portal]] from the Mini-Series [[overworld]] to the game overworld.

== History ==
It is unknown who or when enchanted the six eyes of ender, but since then [[Zeus]] has hidden them in various places in the [[Greek Isles]] that [[Poseidon]] cannot enter and has ordered various greek myths to guard them. After Poseidon began sponsoring [[CommuniKate]]'s show, and the cast of the show, along with CommuniKate and [[Zed]], were teleported to the Greek Isles, Poseidon forced CommuniKate, Zed, [[Durango]] and [[Quinn]] to bring him all the enchanted eyes for a short amount of time in exchange for the lives of the rest of the show's participants. The heroes find and bring all the eyes to Poseidon, but he tricked them and all the other participants of the show will still be eaten by the [[Kraken]]. However, all the heroes escaped and began to try to prevent Poseidon from taking over the Overworld, which attracted the attention of Zeus, who took the eyes of еnder from Poseidon.
