{{Redirect|village.dat|the file for a single village|villages.dat format}}
{{Outdated|edition=java|This format is no longer used in 1.13. They are no longer separate files from chunks, and instead included in chunk files/format.}}
The '''Village.dat''', '''Fortress.dat''', '''Temple.dat''', '''Mineshaft.dat''', '''Stronghold.dat''', '''Monument.dat''', '''EndCity.dat''', and '''Mansion.dat''' files are located in the data folder of a ''[[Minecraft]]'' level and store information about the generation of [[village]]s, [[Nether fortress]]es, temples ([[desert pyramid]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, [[witch hut]]s and [[igloo]]s), [[mineshaft]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[ocean monument]]s, [[End cities]], and [[woodland mansion]]s respectively, in the level. The structure data is stored in the chunk data.
