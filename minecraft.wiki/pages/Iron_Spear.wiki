An '''iron spear''' is a variant of [[spear]] crafted from [[iron ingot]]s. It can be used to perform slow jab attacks or held forward to deal increasing [[damage]] based on how quickly the wielder is moving. It is the third-highest [[tier]] of spear, dealing more damage and having higher durability than a [[stone spear]], at the cost of lower attack speed.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, and [[zombie villager]]s can sometimes spawn holding iron spears, and have an 8.5% chance to drop it if held (+1% for each level of [[Looting]], up to a maximum of 11.5% with Looting III)

== Usage ==
=== Attacking ===
==== Jab attack ====
A iron spear can be {{control|attack|text=used}} while standing on the ground to perform a jab attack, dealing damage, and afterwards entering a recharge cooldown similar to that of an [[ender pearl]] or [[chorus fruit]] {{in|be}}, the normal attack cooldown, but the spear cannot be used again until it finishes recharging {{in|je}}.

==== Charge attack ====
When holding down the {{control|attack|text=use}} key, the spear is lowered into an attack position, where colliding with a target deals damage depending on the velocity of the user, and the attack dismounts attacked targets from their mounts. After being held out for too long, the charge attack goes into a shaking state where attacks no longer dismount targets from their mounts. After even longer, the charge attack goes into a dropped down state where attacks no longer deal [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]], but still deal full damage.
