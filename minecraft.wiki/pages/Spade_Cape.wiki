The '''Spade Cape''' is a personal [[cape]] that was given to a modder.

== Distribution ==
This cape was given to MrMessiah as gratitude for developing the BetterLight mod, which got integrated into the game and was responsible for Minecraft's lighting and grass features.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/mods-discussion/1341405-mrmmods-betterlight-grass-simplemap-1-8-1|title=MrMMods (BetterLight<nowiki>|</nowiki>Grass, SimpleMap) 1.8.1|website=Minecraft Forum|date=October 13, 2010}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20250615022247/https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/mods-discussion/1341405-mrmmods-betterlight-grass-simplemap-1-8-1 (archive)]</ref> Though it was discussed back in 2011, the cape hadn't been granted until 2015. The artist of the cape is unknown, but MrMessiah thinks it was [[Jeb]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20230422191031/https://i.imgur.com/PzzwwbW.png</ref>
