The '''''Minecraft Game Experience Area''''' ({{w|Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese}}: 我的世界游戏体验区; {{tooltip|lit.|literal}} "My World Game Experience Area") is an online demo for ''[[China Edition]]'', showcasing the basic mechanics of ''[[Minecraft]]''.

== Gameplay ==
The short demo takes place in the NetEase Offices, which have been invaded by [[zombie]]s. The player must make their way into the Kitchen while avoiding or breaking through dirt walls in the way. The Kitchen contains 4 dirt blocks, which must be mined and placed at the room's entrance to block off the zombies.

Once the demo is over, a GIF of the exterior of the NetEase Offices appears along with a link to return to the official website for ''China Edition''.

== Trivia ==
* The basic functionality of the ''Game Experience Area'' is similar to [[Minecraft Classic (JavaScript remake)|Minecraft Classic]], as both can be played in a web browser. The ''Game Experience Area'' seems to use a different engine, as movement is noticeably more unstable and the player cannot properly stand on or walk against certain blocks.
* Dirt is the only block that can be mined or placed.
* The zombies do not move or attack the player, but still make idle sounds.
* The demo uses textures from the [[Programmer Art]] resource pack as it has not been updated for future versions of ''Minecraft''.
* There is a hidden strip of grass blocks to the left of the Kitchen.
* The ceiling does not have any collision.
* Dropped items are unaffected by gravity.
