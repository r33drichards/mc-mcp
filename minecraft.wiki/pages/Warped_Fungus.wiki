A '''warped fungus''' is a mushroom-like block that generates in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A warped fungus can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] and always drops itself. Mining a [[flower pot]] containing a fungus drops both items separately.
{{breaking row|Warped Fungi|link=Warped Fungus|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Warped fungi naturally generate in the [[warped forest]] and [[crimson forest]] biomes, with warped fungus most commonly generating in its respective biome, the warped forest and less frequently in the other, the crimson forest.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a warped fungus drops the fungus upon death.

=== Post-generation ===
Applying [[bone meal]] to [[nylium]] causes warped fungi to appear nearby, similar to [[flower]]s on [[grass block]]s. While warped fungi and other Nether vegetation can generate this way, they are more likely to be the same type as the nylium.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
[[File:FungusPlaceBlock.png|thumb|All of the blocks that warped fungi can be placed on.]]
Warped fungi may be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[podzol]], [[farmland]], [[rooted dirt]], [[moss block]]s, [[nylium]], [[mycelium]], [[soul soil]], [[mud]] and [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Attempting to place it on any other block fails. Warped fungi requires a solid block underneath it, and pops off and drops itself if it is no longer supported.

Warped fungi can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Growth ===
When [[bone meal]] is {{ctrl|used}} on a warped fungus that is planted on matching [[nylium]], it has a 40% chance to grow into its tall equivalent (similar to [[sapling]]s and [[mushroom]]s). Warped fungi grow into [[huge warped fungi]]. The [[log|stem]], [[shroomlight]], or [[wart block]]s may replace certain blocks including [[slab]]s and [[torch]]es.

=== Breeding ===
Warped fungus can be used to breed [[strider]]s and lead them around if crafted as a [[warped fungus on a stick]].

=== Hoglins ===
All [[hoglin]]s, regardless of age, avoid and run up to 7 [[block]]s away from warped fungus when it is placed on a block or inside of a [[flower pot]]{{only|JE}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-75166}}</ref>. Held warped fungi and warped fungi on sticks do not have this effect.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Warped Fungus}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a warped fungus into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
