* Comes in the 16 traditional dye colors.
* Gravity affected (like [[sand]] and [[gravel]]).

* Comes in the 16 traditional dye colors.
* Smelting any colored stained clay in a furnace produces the glazed terracotta of that color (not for regular [[hardened clay]]).
* Can be placed in 4 directions: north, south, west, and east.
** When placed down while facing the right directions, a repeating pattern can be created. For example, the white glazed terracotta creates the pattern of a sun when 4 are placed down correctly.

=== General ===
'''[[Creative]]'''
* Added "[[Saved Toolbars]]" tab.
** Save toolbars in Creative mode with {{key|Ctrl + 1-9}}/{{key|Cmd + 1-9}} and load them with {{key|Shift + 1-9}}.
** Can save up to 9 toolbars.
** If an empty toolbar is saved, it clears the bookmarked toolbar and puts back the 'informational paper' in the respective slot.
