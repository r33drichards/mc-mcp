'''Tuff''' is an ornamental [[rock]], occurring in underground [[Ore (feature)|ore blobs]] below Y=0.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Tuff drops as an item if mined by any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

{{Breaking row|Tuff|Pickaxe|Wood|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Tuff blob.png|thumb|A tuff blob.]]
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
Tuff can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[Ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. Tuff attempts to generate 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations -64 to 0, in all [[biome]]s. Tuff can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], and [[deepslate]]. Any [[ore]] that generates in tuff becomes its deepslate variety.

Additionally, tuff can generate in large [[ore vein|ore veins]] that consist of [[iron ore]] and [[Block of Raw Iron|blocks of raw iron]] below Y=0.

== Trivia ==
* In real life, [[wikipedia:Tuff|tuff]] is a strong type of igneous rock which forms from compressed ash resulting from volcanic eruptions, which sees extensive use in Armenian architecture. Tuff in ''[[Minecraft]]'' is somewhat similar, with the texture representing that of a rough, uneven surface which appears to be the result of volcanic ash formation.
