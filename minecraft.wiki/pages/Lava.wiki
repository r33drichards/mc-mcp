'''Lava''' is a light-emitting [[fluid]] that causes fire [[damage]], mostly found in the [[altitude|lower reaches]] of the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
Lava can be collected by using a [[bucket]] on a lava source block or a full lava [[cauldron]], converting the bucket to a [[lava bucket]]. Lava may be obtained [[renewable resource|renewably]] from [[cauldron]]s, as [[pointed dripstone]] with a lava source above it can slowly fill a cauldron with lava (if in the Nether, the source of lava isn't necessary).

{{IN|JE}}, lava does not have a direct item form, but {{in|be}} it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing or add-ons.

=== Natural generation ===
During world generation, lava replaces [[air]] blocks generated in [[cave]]s and [[canyon]]s between Y=-55 and Y=-63. [[Aquifer]]s are sometimes filled with lava below Y=0. Lava does not replace air blocks inside [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[amethyst geode]]s, or [[stronghold]]s.

Lava can also occur as lava flows from a single [[spring]] block, pouring down walls into pools. The spring block can be on the side of a cave, ravine, mineshaft, or stone cliff above ground.

Lava also generates as small [[lava lake]]s, which can be found above Y=0 within any [[biome]].

Two blocks of lava can also be found in plains, snowy plains, and desert [[village]] weaponsmith buildings, or one source in savanna village weaponsmith buildings.

Fifteen blocks of lava can be found in the [[End portal]] room of a [[stronghold]]: 3 along each side wall, and 9 below the portal frame.

Lava also generates in [[woodland mansion]]s: two blocks of lava generate in the "forge room", and 25 blocks of lava generate in a secret "lava room".

In [[the Nether]], lava is more common than [[water]] is in the [[Overworld]]. [[Terrain features#Lava sea|Seas of lava]] occur, with sea level at y-level 32, about a quarter of the total height of the Nether (as the usable space in the Nether is 128 blocks tall). They can extend down to about y-level 19-22. Lava also randomly appears [[Spring#Hidden springs|in single blocks]] inside [[netherrack]] formations. There are also large pockets of lava generated under y=19 and can reach all the way down to bedrock level. These pockets are generally over 12 blocks in height and often connect to a large lava lake on y=32; the size of these pockets in 1.18 can range from the size of a singular pre-1.18 ravine to multiple ravines combined.

Lava generates as [[delta]] shapes, which can be found commonly in the [[basalt deltas]] biome. Lava is also generated as a single source in well rooms in [[Nether fortress]]es. Lava also generates in [[ruined portal]]s and [[bastion remnant]]s.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Renewability ===
[[File:Dripstone lava source.png|thumb|200px|Using a pointed dripstone to refill a cauldron with lava]]
If there is a lava source above a [[pointed dripstone]] stalactite, there is a {{frac|15|256}} (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron within 10 blocks under the tip with lava after a [[random tick]]. This lava can then be scooped with a bucket, making it a renewable resource.

=== Post-generation ===
Unlike [[Water#Source blocks|water source blocks]], new lava source blocks cannot be created in a space by two or more adjacent source blocks. However {{in|Java}}, if the [[game rule]] {{cd|lavaSourceConversion}} is set to {{cd|true}}, new lava source blocks can form in a similar way to water source blocks.

== Usage ==
=== Burning ===
[[File:Inside Lava.png|thumb|What it looks like inside lava.]]
[[File:Under lava fire resistance.png|thumb|What it looks like inside lava using Fire Resistance {{in|je}}.]]

Most [[entities]] take {{hp|4}} damage every tick (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second) while in contact with lava, and are set on [[fire]]. An entity or player in lava also has its {{code|remainingFireTicks}} set to 300, setting it on fire for 15 seconds. This timer is reset to 300 every tick that the victim spends in lava, so it starts counting down once the victim leaves the lava. Once the victim does exit the lava source, it burns for just under 15 seconds, taking fire damage 14 times. This is due to the fact that for the first tick outside of lava, its {{code|remainingFireTicks}} decreases to 299, and entities take fire damage when {{code|remainingFireTicks}} is a multiple of 20 and greater than 0. If the victim touches water or [[rain]], the fire is extinguished, but the lava continues to damage them directly.

In addition, a dense [[fog]] effect is applied for players under lava to obscure vision. This can be slightly mitigated via the [[Fire Resistance]] effect. In [[Spectator]] mode, the fog effect is removed and players can see through lava.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a player with the Fire Resistance effect or a total [[Fire Protection]] of 7 or higher does not catch fire. 

Most of the Nether [[mob]]s ([[blaze]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[strider]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, [[zoglin]]s, and [[zombified piglin]]s), [[agent]]s, [[NPC]]s, [[vex]]es, [[ender dragon]]s, [[shulker]]s, [[warden]]s, [[wither]]s, and players or mobs affected by the [[Fire Resistance]] effect are not damaged when touching lava. 

The embers or fireballs that fly out of lava are purely decorative and do not cause fires or damage to entities. When rain falls on lava, the black ember particles appear more frequently.

A player in lava lasts a few seconds before dying:

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
* 2.5 seconds with no armor
* 3.5 seconds with full leather armor, no enchantments
* 4 seconds with full gold armor, no enchantments
* 4.5 seconds with full chainmail armor, no enchantments

* 6.5 seconds with full iron armor, no enchantments
* 12.5 seconds with full diamond armor, no enchantments
* 12.5 seconds with full netherite armor, no enchantments
A player who is wearing armor enchanted with [[Fire Protection]] can survive even longer. With the maximum bonus, the damage is small enough that the natural healing from a full hunger bar can outpace it,{{only|JE|short=1}} so a player who has food and armor that resists damage (non-netherite armor is damaged by lava) could survive indefinitely. This damage-resisting condition can be attained by wearing two pieces of armor with [[Fire Protection]] IV and one with [[Protection]] IV, or one piece of armor with Fire Protection IV and three with Protection IV.

==== Fire spread ====
Lava—of any depth, both source blocks and flowing—can cause fires by turning air blocks to fire blocks.

In order for air above lava to turn to fire, a block adjacent to the air has to be [[flammable]], or one of the wood-constructed [[non-flammable]] blocks. Since catching fire depends on air blocks, even torches or lava itself can prevent a flammable block from catching fire. Additionally, not all flammable or wood-constructed blocks can be ignited by lava. Fire can spread at a distance from the lava, and it can spread through at least non-solid blocks (like glass blocks).

Additional conditions must be met, depending on the edition of Minecraft.
===== ''Java Edition'' =====
{{FakeImage|align=right|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|L=lava|w=Oak Planks|p=Orange Stained Glass|s=Light Gray Stained Glass|wwwwwwwww|wwsssssww|wspppppsw|wwspppsww|wwwsLswww|wwwwwwwww}}|Example for JE. The orange area represents areas where air could catch flame if the gray and orange areas contain flammable blocks. The planks are all at a safe distance.
}}

Air block must be in a 3×1×3 area right above the lava or in a 5×1×5 2 blocks above the lava.

An air block in the 5×1×5 area does not catch on fire if the 3×1×3 area is completely filled, even if the latter is filled with flammable blocks.

===== ''Bedrock Edition'' =====
The block to be set on fire must be in a 3×3×3 cube centered on a lava block, above which there must be either air or an ignitable block.

=== Flow ===
{{See also|Fluid}}

Lava flows from "source blocks". Most streams or "lava-falls" come from a single source block, but lava lakes (including the "flood lava" in the bottom 10 layers) are composed entirely of source blocks. A source block can be captured only with a [[lava bucket|bucket]].

In the [[Overworld]] and [[the End]], lava travels 3 blocks in any horizontal direction from a source block. Lava flows far more slowly than water (1 block every 30 game ticks, or 1.5 seconds), and sourceless lava flows linger for a short time more. In [[the Nether]], lava travels 7 blocks horizontally and spreads 1 block every 10 game ticks, or 2 blocks per second, which is half the speed of water in the Overworld. In all dimensions, lava spreading uses the same mechanic as water: For every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. (This can result in lava flows turning toward dropoffs that they cannot reach in the Overworld and the End.)

Flowing lava destroys certain non-solid blocks similarly to water. However, those blocks do not drop their loot when destroyed by lava. [[Sugar cane]]s hold back lava, but disappear if the sugar cane's water source is destroyed by the lava.

A one-block lava flow can be redirected by receiving block updates, which causes it to reset the flow toward the now-nearest terrain depression, but does not cut off its current direction of flow. The change cannot be reversed.

In Bedrock Edition the /setblock command can be used to create stationary lava without the use of barriers. 

Flowing lava can push entities, including those that do not take lava damage.

=== Lava and water ===
{{Main|Fluid#Mixing}}

Water and lava can produce [[stone]], [[cobblestone]], or [[obsidian]] based on how they interact. Lava can also generate [[basalt]] when above soul soil and touching blue ice.

=== Light source ===
Lava blocks emit a [[light]] level of 15.

=== Other ===
[[File:LavaDropletsExample.png|thumb|If there is lava flowing above a [[block]], the lava seeps through.]]

An [[entity]] moving in lava has its horizontal movement speed reduced by 50% and its vertical movement speed reduced by 20%. A player cannot [[sprint-swimming|sprint-swim]] in lava.

Lava can partially or completely absorb fall damage: for each [[tick]] an entity spends inside of lava, its fall distance<ref>As in the value used by the game to determine the amount of fall damage to apply to a falling entity once it lands.</ref> is halved.

Lava above a block that has a top surface that is 1+ blocks high (excluding blocks with the {{code|impermeable}} [[block tag]]) produces dripping particles on the underside of that block (unless said block has a 0 blocks high bottom surface and another block with a 1+ blocks high top surface below itself). These droplets do not do anything other than warn the player that a deluge of lava lies above that block. The particles function identically to their water counterparts, except that they drip slower.

Flowing lava can set off tripwires because it breaks placed string. Lava triggers a tripwire only once.

Any [[item (entity)|item]] dropped into lava is immediately destroyed, except for [[netherite]]-related items.

Lava can be placed in an empty [[cauldron]].

If lava is above a non-transparent block supporting [[pointed dripstone]], dripping particles are created on the end. These can fill cauldrons with lava.

== Farming ==
{{main|Tutorial:Lava farming}}
Lava farms can be created by placing a lava source block on top of a solid block and placing a [[pointed dripstone]] and a [[cauldron]] underneath it.

Lava spends most of its time as stationary, rather than 'flowing' – regardless of its level, or whether it contains a current downward or to the side. When specifically triggered by a block update, lava changes to 'flowing', update its level, then change back to stationary. Lava springs are generated as flowing, and lava lakes are generated as stationary.

{{el|je}}:
{{bst|level|0

Value 0 is used for lava source blocks. Values from 1 to 7 are reversed compared to fluidstate level values: for example, a lava block with a level 1 fluidstate will have a level 7 blockstate, a lava block with a level 2 fluidstate will have a level 6 blockstate, and so on. Value 8 matches its fluidstate counterpart. Values above 8 can only be obtained with commands. For more informations about how lava spreads, see [[fluid#Level]].|foot=1}}

If bit 0x8 is set, this fluid is "falling" and spreads only downward. At this level, the lower bits are essentially ignored, since this block is then at its highest fluid level. This level is equal to the falling lava above, equal to 8 plus the level of the non-falling lava above it.

The lower three bits are the fluid block's level. 0 is the highest fluid level (not necessarily filling the block - this depends on the neighboring fluid blocks above each upper corner of the block). Data values increase as the fluid level of the block drops: 1 is the next highest, 2 lower, on through 7, the lowest fluid level. Along a line on a flat plane, lava drops one level per meter in the Nether and two everywhere else. So in [[the End]] and [[Overworld]], only 2, 4 and 6 are used.|foot=1}}

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* An arrow catches fire when shot into flowing lava, but not still lava.
* [[Water]] flows into lava-occupied blocks as though it were empty space, and vice versa.
* Although lava is a fluid, it is not possible to drown in lava. This applies to all mobs. However, it is still possible to suffocate in lava. This applies to almost every mob.{{only|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-17073}}</ref>
* If the lava texture is changed to be transparent via a [[resource pack]], it does not become transparent.
* {{IN|bedrock}}, lava does not deactivate [[elytra]] like [[water]] does.
* Geologically, lava in the Overworld is consistent with [[wikipedia:Felsic lava|felsic lava]], and lava in the Nether is consistent with [[wikipedia:mafic lava|mafic lava]]. Felsic lava is slow, sticky, and does not run as far as mafic lava, which is relatively thin and runny.
* {{anchor|Lave}}In [[Java Edition 22w44a|22w44a]], when the [[gamerule]] {{cd|lavaSourceConversion}} was added, the title of the game rule in the "Edit Game Rules" section of the "Create World Screen" had "lava" misspelled as "lave".<ref>{{bug|MC-257104}}</ref> A [[splash]] text was later added in [[Java Edition 1.19.3 Pre-release 1|1.19.3-pre1]] that says "Made with lave!".
