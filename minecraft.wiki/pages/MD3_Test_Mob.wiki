The '''MD3 test mobs''' were a series of models from ''{{w|Quake III Arena}}'' used to test support for the [https://www.icculus.org/~phaethon/q3/formats/md3format.html MD3 model format] in some [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-0040/Development|unreleased development builds]] of [[Indev]].<ref>{{YouTube link|vuTRIdGFPTM|Minecraft MD3 test|Nizzotch|December 7, 2009}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I0VWO-xxMg Archive])</ref>

== Appearance ==
The MD3 test mobs come in several variations, which use character models and animations from the game ''Quake III Arena'': Biker, Bitterman, Doom, Hunter, Klesk, Mynx, Phobos, Ranger, Razor, Sarge, and Uriel. Their textures have a lower resolution compared to the original models.<ref>{{WON|273755794|Those are q3 models with very low res textures.|December 8, 2009}}</ref> Some characters appear in their blue team outfits, have textures placed on incorrect meshes, and lack transparency. Sometimes, their animation is glitched and the models appear to walk bent.

== Spawning ==
The MD3 test mobs spawn randomly all over the world.

== Behavior ==
The MD3 test mobs exhibit the basic [[monster (entity)|monster]] behavior, walking toward and attacking the player. They can jump, and deal {{hp|3}} or {{hp|4}} damage when they touch the player. Their appearance has no effect on their behavior, which is identical for all model variations.
