On May 19, 2023, a game with two modes was released to promote the collaboration. When scanning your ''Minecraft'' Crocs, the game will start and you will be able to choose between two modes: Crocs Creator and Crocs Crossing. In Crocs Creator, the player can build their own structures from blocky Jibbitz on a small platform. In Crocs Crossing, the player must run along a straight path, collecting Jibbitz and dodging creepers and lava.
