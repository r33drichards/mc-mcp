[[File:Smithing Table GUI 1.20.png|thumb|right|The [[smithing table]] interface.]]
'''Smithing''' is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows players to upgrade [[tool]]s and [[armor]] both in material and in appearance through the use of a [[smithing table]].

== Equipment ==
A smithing table and three ingredients are required for each smithing action the player wishes to perform. Each time working on a smithing table, the player must provide a [[smithing template]], [[armor]]/[[tool]], and an augmenting material.

=== Upgrading ===
Upgrading is a process for turning [[diamond]] gear into [[netherite]] gear. This is the only way that netherite gear can be obtained.

While upgrading, the newly crafted netherite gear retains the [[enchantment]]s, name, [[prior work penalty]], and number of [[durability]] points lost (instead of the remaining durability) from the diamond gear. Upgrading gear does not remove incompatible enchantments, such as multiple different [[Protection]] enchantments.

Using a smithing table to upgrade diamond gear to netherite gear costs no [[experience]] and does not increase the prior work penalty.

When upgraded to netherite, all items are granted resistance to [[fire]] and [[lava]] when dropped in the world, and their [[durability]] and [[enchantability]] are increased. Swords and tools (except for hoes {{in|je}}) deal a higher [[attack damage]] and the [[mining speed]] of tools is improved as well. Each piece of netherite armor gives 10% of knockback reduction, protecting 40% with a full set. [[Armor toughness]] is also increased.

=== Trimming ===
[[File:Armor Trims On Netherite Armors.png|thumb|A display of all armor trims in every color on netherite armor.]]

Trimming allows players to customize an [[armor]] piece's appearance by applying a material using one of the following smithing templates. During trimming, the decorative pattern applied to the armor corresponds to the trim used, with the color determined by the used material. The template is consumed in the process.

==== Template ====
*{{ItemLink|Bolt Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Coast Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Dune Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Eye Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Flow Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Host Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Raiser Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Rib Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Sentry Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Shaper Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Silence Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Snout Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Spire Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Tide Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Vex Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Ward Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Wayfinder Armor Trim}}
*{{ItemLink|Wild Armor Trim}}

==== Material ====
*{{ItemLink|Amethyst Shard}}
*{{ItemLink|Copper Ingot}}
*{{ItemLink|Diamond}}
*{{ItemLink|Emerald}}
*{{ItemLink|Gold Ingot}}
*{{ItemLink|Iron Ingot}}
*{{ItemLink|Lapis Lazuli}}
*{{ItemLink|Nether Quartz}}
*{{ItemLink|Netherite Ingot}}
*{{ItemLink|Redstone Dust}}
*{{ItemLink|Resin Brick}}

All trims are purely decorative, and don't impact gameplay in any way. [[Piglin]]s do not pick up any gold-trimmed armor pieces and remain hostile towards players wearing gold-trimmed armor, unless the base armor is also golden. Non-netherite armor pieces trimmed with netherite still burn if {{control|dropped}} in [[fire]] or [[lava]].

Most armor trims cover a small portion of the armor piece's surface with the trim material, except for the silence armor trim, which allows the trim material to cover a majority of the armor piece's surface.

Armor with a trim can be trimmed again by applying another template to it; the old trim pattern is overwritten in the process.<ref>{{bug|MC-262538||When combining armor trims the new trim deletes the old one|WAI}}</ref> Therefore, one piece of armor cannot possess multiple trims at the same time.
