{{-}}

'''[[Mooshroom]]s'''
* Their textures have been changed, and the nose now extrudes from their models.

'''[[Chicken]], [[cow]] and [[pig]] variants'''
* Have been moved from experimental features and are now available during normal gameplay.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Village]]s'''
* Chests in several village buildings now have a 33% chance of containing a [[bundle]]. These include:
** Cartographer
** Tannery
** Weaponsmith
** Desert House
** Plains House
** Snowy House
** Savanna House
** Taiga House

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death]]'''
* Players no longer keep their inventory by default on Peaceful and Easy difficulties.
* Keep inventory is back to being a cheat on all difficulties.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|aimassist}}'''
* Has been moved from experimental features and is now available during normal gameplay.

=== Technical ===
'''Components'''
* Added validation for asset references in components.
** Content errors will log missing references for the following fields:
*** item references.
*** block reference in item component in {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}}.
*** loot table reference in block component {{cd|minecraft:loot}}.
* The {{cd|entity_sensor}} component's {{cd|find_players_only}} field now functions correctly, properly restricting searches to Players only and affecting all subsensors.

'''Dedicated Server'''
* Exposed two new parameters for dedicated server when in {{cd|server-auth-with-rewind}}. These will make the server more strict on player positions. Look in {{cd|server.properties}} for more information on what these do.
** {{cd|server-authoritative-movement-strict}} default to {{cd|false}} and can be set to {{cd|true}}. Will affect Player position acceptance.
** {{cd|server-authoritative-dismount-strict}} default to {{cd|false}} and can be set to {{cd|true}}. Will affect Player position when dismounting.

'''Entity Event Responses'''
* Added the {{cd|stop_movement}} entity event response, which stops the entity's movement.
** The {{cd|stop_vertical_movement}} field specifies whether vertical movement should be stopped.
** The {{cd|stop_horizontal_movement}} field specifies whether horizontal movement should be stopped.
** This response does not stop navigation or prevent future movement.
*** If that's the desired outcome, also remove the components responsible for that.
* Added the {{cd|set_home_position}} entity event response, which sets the entity's home position to its current position.
** For this to have any effect, the entity must already have a {{cd|minecraft:home}} component.

'''Entity Events'''
* Added {{cd|first_valid}} event type, it will evaluate every filter in order and execute the first valid one.

'''Entity Filters'''
* The {{cd|in_clouds}} entity filter now succeeds when an entity's bounding box intersects the cloud layer, rather than only when its bottom is within it.

'''Mobs'''
* Added aquatic family-type for all aquatic mobs.
* Normal minecart is no longer considered a mob.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''{{cd|@minecraft/server-net}}'''
* Added new error {{cd|InternalHttpRequestError}}.
** An error thrown when a platform-level HTTP error occurs. Information provided in this class may be useful for diagnostics purposes but will differ from platform to platform.
* Added new error {{cd|MalformedHttpRequestError}}.
** An error thrown when a malformed HTTP request is attempted to be sent.

'''{{cd|@minecraft/server-ui}}'''
* Added method {{cd|divider(): ActionFormData;}}. It adds a section divider into the form.
* Added method {{cd|divider(): ModalFormData;}}. It adds a section divider into the form.

'''Blocks'''
* {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} component has a new experimental boolean field {{cd|isotropic}} for format version 1.21.70 and higher, this field controls rotating the face UVs randomly based on {{cd|BlockPos}}.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''Behavior packs'''
* Removed unused experimental json field {{cd|peaks_factor}} from {{cd|minecraft:mountain_parameters}} in the behavior pack biome file.

'''{{cd|@minecraft/server-net}}'''
* Updated the execution privilege of most APIs to allow them to be called in read-only contexts ("before" events).

== Fixes ==

* Fixed the behavior of the Darkness status effect in the Deferred Technical Preview.</onlyinclude>
