=== Easter egg in [[Java Edition 20w14∞|20w14∞]] ===
In the April fools' snapshot, 20w14∞, a single easter egg dimension, [[Java Edition 20w14∞#last page dimension|"this_is_a_very_long_phrase_that_is_hopefully_not_in_any_dictionary"]] has a custom message supposedly written by boq.
[[File:Last_page_dimension.png|alt=a message written with grass blocks reading "Hello! Only purpose of this message was to troll completionists and put my name somewhere in Minecraft (again!). I hope it wasn't cracked by accident – it was obviously supposed to take more time than other phrases. Written during time of plague by boq (yes. lowercase. because symmetry) "All these worlds are yours, except Europa*. Use them together. Use them in peace. " *Europa™️* the Moon sold separately."|none|thumb|width=416x416|The secret message written by boq]]
