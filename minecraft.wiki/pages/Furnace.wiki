A '''furnace''' is a [[block]] with two functions: it can be used for either [[smelting]] or [[cooking]], by placing [[fuel]] and an appropriate [[item]] inside together.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A furnace can be picked up using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it does not drop itself.

Furnaces drop their contents when broken, including XP from processed items that were extracted by hoppers.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Furnace|Pickaxe|Wood|foot=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Furnaces can be found in [[plains]], [[desert]], and some [[savanna]] [[village]] weaponsmiths. Furnaces also generate in some houses in [[snowy village]], and in one of the [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} village houses. They can also generate in [[ancient cities]] and [[trail ruin]]s, and one furnace generates in every [[igloo]].

The lit furnace can be obtained {{in|java}} only with commands such as {{cmd|give @s <nowiki>minecraft:furnace[minecraft:block_state={lit:"true"}]</nowiki>}}, although it does not appear lit in the inventory. {{IN|bedrock}}, the lit furnace block can be obtained only by inventory editing. It always stays lit, despite containing no items.

== Usage ==
Furnaces cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s {{in|java}}.

=== Processing items ===
{{main|Smelting|Cooked food}}
[[File:Furnace GUI.png|thumb|right|Interface for the furnace {{in|Java}}.]]

The purpose of a furnace is to process items by heating them up in order to change them into other items. Its interface can be opened by pressing the {{Control|use item}} button on it. A fuel source (up to one stack of fuel items) is placed in the bottom slot, and the items to be processed (up to one stack) goes in the upper slot. A furnace runs at a speed of one item every {{convert|200|game tick|second}} or six items per minute.

The number of items that a fuel source can process depends on the type of fuel. As soon as the process begins, the fuel slot is decremented immediately, and that unit of fuel starts burning. The fuel continues burning until fully consumed, regardless of whether the upper slot has any items remaining to process. For example, a piece of coal burns for 80 seconds and can process eight items, but if only one item is processed (or if the item is pulled out before the process is complete), the coal still continues burning for the full 80 seconds, wasting seven items’ worth of processing. After it burns out, no additional fuel is decremented from the fuel slot if the upper slot is empty. If the fuel slot is empty and the burning fuel is consumed before an item completes processing, the process stops, the item is unchanged, and the process must be restarted with new fuel.

=== Light source ===
[[File:Lit Furnace (S).gif|thumb|Lit furnace]]
Furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, as well as smoke and flame [[particles]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Custom name ===
By default, the GUI of a furnace is labeled "Furnace", but this name can be customized by naming it in an [[anvil]] before placing it, or by changing the <code>CustomName</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command{{only|Java}}.

=== Lock ===
{{IN|je}}, a furnace can be "locked" by setting its <code>lock</code> tag using the {{cmd|data}} command. If a furnace's <code>lock</code> tag is not blank, the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item that matches the item predicate in the <code>lock</code> tag. For example, to lock a furnace at (0,64,0) so that the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Furnace Key", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 <nowiki>{lock:{components:{"custom_name":"Furnace Key"}}}</nowiki>}}.

=== Note blocks ===
A furnace can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
