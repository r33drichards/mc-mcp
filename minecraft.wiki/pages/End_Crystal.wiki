An '''End crystal''' is an [[entity]] that can be [[crafted]] or found on [[the End]]'s main island, where it heals the [[ender dragon]]. It can be placed only on [[obsidian]] or [[bedrock]], and it [[explode]]s instantly when attacked or damaged in most ways.

== Spawning ==
=== Natural generation ===
An End crystal is found on the top of each [[obsidian pillar]] on the central island of the End, each on top of a [[bedrock]] block. There are 10 End crystals in total, two of which are protected in "cages" of [[iron bars]]. All End crystals respawn one after another as the respawning process of the [[ender dragon]] starts.

== Usage ==
=== Healing the ender dragon ===
Their primary purpose is to recharge the health of the ender dragon, who gains a charge from the nearest crystal within a cuboid extending 32 blocks from the dragon in all directions. The dragon is healed {{hp|1}} each half-second. If multiple ender dragons are spawned, an End crystal can affect multiple dragons at the same time. Entities and blocks neither obstruct the healing beam nor diminish its power.

=== Respawning the ender dragon ===
[[File:End Crystals on the Exit portal.png|right|thumb|How to arrange End crystals on the exit portal to respawn the ender dragon.]]

As items, End crystals may be placed on bedrock and [[obsidian]], as long as the two blocks above the bedrock or obsidian are air or replaceable blocks and no other entities intersect the area.

When an End crystal is placed in [[the End]], a [[fire]] block is created at the End crystal location. If four are placed on the End [[exit portal]], one on each of the flat sides, the crystals respawn the original End crystals on the [[obsidian pillar]]s,  resurrect the dragon, and then explode. The top of each pillar also explodes, destroying any player-placed blocks. This happens even if TNT explosions are turned off in settings.

If the exit portal is ever broken for any reason, End crystals can still be placed on obsidian blocks that are at the same location as where the exit portal would have been.

=== Explosions ===
End crystals explode when attacked or damaged in most ways, even by attacks that normally do zero damage. They are not affected by exploding fireworks, and if damaged by an explosion, they disappear instead of exploding.{{Only|Java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-118429||End crystals don't explode when destroyed by nearby explosions}}</ref> The End crystal's [[explosion]] has an [[Explosion#Causes|explosion strength]] of 6, the same as a [[charged creeper]]. The End crystal's fire often remains after the crystal explodes. Any ender dragon charging from the crystal when it is destroyed takes {{hp|10}} damage.

An End crystal's explosion can be [[blocked]] by a [[shield]].

Although an ender dragon damages most blocks and entities in its path, it cannot destroy End crystals.

Placing [[water]] on the End crystal neutralizes the blast effect but not the [[damage]] or knockback.

End crystals with obsidian or bedrock below them do not damage blocks below them when they explode because the center of the explosion center is at the bottom of the End crystal.

{{IN|bedrock}}, setting the game rule <code>mobGriefing</code> to <code>false</code> prevents the End crystal from destroying any blocks.

=== Beams ===
The End crystal shoots a beam at the ender dragon and heals it when the dragon is within range.{{info needed|What is the range in blocks?}} This beam can be manually created using the command {{cmd|data merge entity @e[type{{=}}end_crystal,limit{{=}}1] {beam_target: [I; 0, 0, 0]<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}. The beam can be pointed in any direction, allowing it to mark locations or objects.

=== Properties ===
[[File:End Crystal (Slateless).gif|thumb|A baseless End crystal.]]  

End crystals are of two kinds: the ones with a base beneath them are created either by game mechanism or by the {{cmd|summon}} command; while the base-less ones are created by players by manually placing the crystal items on top of [[obsidian]] or [[bedrock]].

The base appears to be made of bedrock, with a crystal hovering over it. While in the End, a crystal continually generates fire at its current position, one block above the base (directly on top of the block the base is embedded in), replacing any other block at that location. This fire is capable of spreading.

The End crystal entity is not solid and can be walked through freely. End crystals can be pushed by [[piston]]s, but they explode if moved while on fire. Because fire is checked only when an entity moves, End crystals do not normally take damage from their own fire unless moved.

=== Entity data ===
End crystals have entity data that define various properties of the entity.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* According to [[Jeb]], the reason behind the current crafting recipe using glass as opposed to [[chorus fruit]] or any materials introduced in [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]] is as a means for players to craft End crystals in older worlds that the dragon has already been killed in.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|667000226524372992|The problem is that you need to be able to craft the crystals on worlds in which the dragon has been destroyed already|November 18, 2015}}</ref>
* A [[:File:Beacon JE2.gif|historical rendition]] of the [[beacon]] block featured an animated entity within it, which resembled a yellow miniaturized End crystal. The bedrock platform of the End crystal entity would also render below the beacon, though this would normally be hidden within the block below.
* The signs on the End Crystal are actually Minecraft language letters spelling out “MOJANG”.
