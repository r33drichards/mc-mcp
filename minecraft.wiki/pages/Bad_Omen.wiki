'''Bad Omen''' is a [[status effect]], obtained by consuming an [[ominous bottle]]. It can transform into [[Raid Omen]] in a [[village]] to start a [[raid]], or into [[Trial Omen]] when seen by a non-ominous [[trial spawner]], to start an [[ominous trial]].

== Effect ==
Bad Omen can be obtained by consuming an [[ominous bottle]], obtained from either raid captains outside of a raid or from [[vault]]s. Being affected by Bad Omen allows players to initiate [[ominous event]]s.

If a player enters a village with Bad Omen, it transforms into [[Raid Omen]], which triggers a [[raid]] after 30 seconds. {{IN|java}}, if the omen level is above 2, an extra wave of raiders will occur after the final wave. Each level after the second will increase the enchantment level of the incoming raiders' equipment, and the resulting [[Hero of the Village]] effect will match the level of the omen, if all raiders have been defeated with villagers still alive. {{IN|bedrock}}, the level of Bad Omen has no effect on raids, and only affects trial spawners (see below).

If the player has the Bad Omen effect and goes near a non-ominous [[trial spawner]], it transforms into [[Trial Omen]], which converts all nearby [[trial spawner]]s into [[ominous trial spawner]]s that are significantly harder to deal with and also have better loot. The omen lasts for 15 minutes multiplied by the level of the Bad Omen. Defeating an ominous trial spawner allows the player to obtain [[ominous trial key]]s, which in turn open [[ominous vault]]s that can drop loot of significantly higher quality, including one of two [[Trial Chambers|trial chamber]] exclusive [[smithing template]]s and the [[heavy core]] needed to craft the [[mace]].

Bad Omen is a [[status effect]] and can be removed through all conventional methods, such as drinking [[milk]] or dying.

The player can still receive the Bad Omen effect in Peaceful difficulty via [[vault]]s (all pillager captains despawn in Peaceful), but does not transform into [[Raid Omen]] if in a village.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*If the player leaves a village during a raid, receives Bad Omen, and returns to the village, the effect transforms into Raid Omen, but does not affect the current raid.
*If the player kills a captain while in a [[village]] {{in|Bedrock}}, the raid bar and Bad Omen effect appear simultaneously. The effect disappears immediately after, then "flashes" again approximately 1 second later.{{Verify|edition=bedrock|Does this still work with the new Bad Omen mechanics in 1.21.0?}}
