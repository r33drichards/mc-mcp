{{wip}}
''Minecraft'' uses an assortment of different '''placeholder textures''' for handling cases where textures cannot be drawn normally.

== Missing texture ==
{{main|Missing textures and models#Missing texture}}
The most known, the '''missing texture''', is a texture composed of a black and magenta checkerboard, and turns up anytime a texture or model reference could not be correctly resolved.

== Animation placeholder textures ==
{{main|Animation placeholder texture}}
Another type of placeholder texture, these were overwritten by the actual animated textures during gameplay [[Procedural animated texture generation|once said textures were generated by the game]]. They would appear themselves in the event that the associated animation could not be generated for whatever reason.

== Texture atlas blank spaces ==
{{Outdated feature|section=1}}
{{info needed section|items.png and inventory.png also have other separate placeholder textures that are different from just empty areas}}
When predefined [[texture atlas]]es were used for storing and loading textures, certain patterns were used for marking unused regions on some atlases, where others simply used outright blank spaces.

These texture spots end up being removed as the texture atlases containing them are split up into individual files.

== Default texture ==
In some cases where textures were not explicitly defined for certain blocks, the blocks in question would "default" to the texture at position (0,0) of the texture atlas in use. Where <samp>terrain.png</samp> is used, this was the top of the [[grass block]]; however, with the deprecation of predefined texture atlases and their replacement with atlases that generate at runtime, this texture tended to shift with time.

Since 14w25a, the majority of such cases are instead directed to the [[missing texture]], although some notable outliers persisted beyond this point.

|{{HistoryLine||rd-131655|{{pximg|Grass Block (top texture) JE1.png|32px}} The texture at (0,0) in the current block texture atlas, <samp>terrain.png</samp>, is the top of the [[grass block]].}}
|{{HistoryLine||rd-20090515|{{pximg|Grass Block (top texture) JE2.png|32px}} The grass block top texture has changed.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java alpha}}
|{{HistoryLine||v1.2.0|dev=preview|{{pximg|Grass Block (top texture) JE3 BE1.png|32px}} The grass block top texture has changed.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5|{{pximg|Grass Block (top texture) JE4 BE2.png|32px}} The grass block top texture has changed.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.5|dev=13w02a|<samp>terrain.png</samp> has been removed and replaced with texture atlases generated at runtime.
|{{pximg|Missing Texture JE2.png|64px}} By default, the texture at (0,0) is the [[missing texture]], meaning that certain [[Java Edition missing texture and model uses#Missing texture|things that use this texture in-game]] actually use it due to it being the texture at (0,0), rather than it being the missing texture and pointing to it in error cases. It is possible to distinguish default texture uses from true uses of the missing texture by applying a texture pack with a block graphic which is larger than 64x64: blocks that point to the missing texture specifically still use the missing texture and will therefore be unaffected by the texture pack, but those that simply point to the default position use the new, large texture provided by the texture pack.{{info needed|Further investigation is needed withr expect to exactly how much of the texture is used; earlier testing was inconclusive}}}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.6.1|dev=13w18a|The missing texture has changed in this version, becoming 16x16 from its previous 64x64 size.
|{{pximg|Flowing Lava (texture) JE2.png|64px}} As such, due to how textures are ordered in atlases the game generates, it is no longer at the top-left of the atlas, instead being replaced by the 32x32 [[flowing lava]] texture, which is used in these cases.{{info needed|Is only the top left quadrant used?}}}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w18b|The flowing lava particles are now animated.<ref>{{bug|MC-15020}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w06a|{{pximg|Block of Redstone (texture) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} Unreferenced textures now point to the [[block of redstone]] texture instead, likely as a fix to {{bug|MC-46427}}.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w06b|End portals and moving pistons now have the lava texture again when broken, although barriers still use the redstone block texture. This is likely due to the fix for {{bug|MC-47482}}.}}

}}

== Bedrock Edition missing textures ==
{{for|cases where these placeholder textures were used in-game|Bedrock Edition missing tile texture uses}}
Unlike in ''Java Edition'', which has a single missing texture that is generated by the game at runtime, ''Bedrock Edition'' defines other textures as image files in the game's assets directory:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! Path
! Use case
|-
! {{pximg|Missing Tile (texture) BE3.png|144px}}
| <code>textures/blocks/missing_tile.png</code>
| Commonly used for blocks and their item forms that have no assigned texture or blocks that are in the game and have their texture, but the texture isn't assigned correctly.
|-
! {{pximg|Missing Item (texture) BE.png|144px}}
| <code>textures/ui/missing_item.png</code>
| Unknown{{info needed|The name implies it's used for items with no texture. Is there a way to confirm that this indeed is the case, or is it actually unused?}}
