'''Dyes''' are a set of sixteen items used to change the color of [[wool]], [[carpet]]s, [[terracotta]], [[concrete powder]], [[glass]], [[shulker box]]es, [[bed]]s, [[candle]]s, [[bundle]]s, [[harness]]es, the patterns on [[banner]]s, [[firework star]]s, certain mobs, and text on [[sign]]s and [[hanging sign]]s. {{IN|bedrock}} they can also be used to dye water in a [[cauldron]] (which is thereafter used to dye [[leather armor]]) and [[shulker]]s; {{in|java}}, leather armor can be dyed directly. {{IN|education}}, dyes can also be used to dye [[balloon]]s and [[glow stick]]s.

{{IN|bedrock|education}}, [[bone meal]], [[ink sac]]s, [[lapis lazuli]], and [[cocoa bean]]s can generally substitute for [[white dye]], [[black dye]], [[blue dye]], and [[brown dye]], respectively, in crafting recipes and for use in dyeing items or mobs. However, they have other important uses that aren't related to color, and are therefore not considered true dyes. They are mentioned in this article only regarding their use as dyeing agents; see their individual articles for complete information about them.
[[File:Dye Recipes.png|thumb|400px|A guide for creating all the dyes]]

== Obtaining ==
[[File:Dye_creation_chart.png|thumb|400px|A chart showing which pairs of dyes can be used to craft other dyes]]
Most dyes can be crafted from [[flower]]s and a few other items; some dyes can be crafted by combining multiple dyes of different colors, and every dye is [[trading|sold]] by the [[wandering trader]]. Some dyes can also be found in loot, and [[green dye]] is obtained by smelting [[cactus]].

=== Banner patterns ===
{{main|Banner#Patterns}}
Dyes are used to add a banner pattern to a banner. When using a [[loom]], each pattern uses 1 dye, which also determines the color of that pattern.

=== Dyeing water inside cauldrons ===
{{Anchor|Dyeing water}}
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
Water can be dyed in a cauldron by holding any dye in the hand and pressing {{Ctrl|use}} on a cauldron filled with water.

=== Dyeing armor ===
{{Calculator|armorColor}}
[[File:Leather armor dye graph.png|200px|thumb|A graph showing all combinations of two dyes on a [[leather tunic]] {{in|je}}.]]
[[Leather armor]], [[wolf armor]], [[leather horse armor]] can be dyed:
*{{IN|Bedrock|Console}}, armor is dyed by {{control|using}} it on a [[cauldron]] filled with dyed water. This consumes 1 layer of water but does not change the color of the water.
**The armor can be undyed by {{control|using}} it on a cauldron with undyed water. This does not change the water's color to the color of the armor, and changes the armor to have no dye color.
**Adding a dye to dyed water mixes the color of the water with the color of the dye, as 2 colors (using the formula below). The game does not remember which colors were placed into the cauldron. It just mixes the current color with the added dye, using the formula below. So, blue + pink + blue + pink is not the same as pink + blue + pink + blue.
*{{IN|java}}, it is possible to [[craft]] more than one dye with the armor, and armor can be dyed multiple times with previous colors affecting the outcome.
**Colored armor can be reverted to its original color by {{control|using}} it on a cauldron with undyed water.
**Since multiple dyes can be combined at once, more colors of dyed armor are obtainable in Survival. The exact number is 5,713,438. See [[Talk:Dye#Number of ways to dye leather armor|this discussion]] for more information.

If armor is renamed on an [[anvil]], it retains its name when dyed or undyed.

; Mixing samples
{{JE}}:

==== Dye mixing formula ====
Each edition of the game uses a specific formula for calculating the color of dyed armor. In this formula, the color of armor or cauldron water, and each dye color, in the RGB color model, has a red value, green value, and blue value.

{{Collapse
|title='''{{JE}}'''
|content=
In ''Java Edition'', dyes can be applied to a piece of leather armor using crafting.

Suppose each color is a point on the coordinate plane, <math>c=\left(r,g,b\right)</math>. This means that:
*<math>r</math> (the <span style="color:#f44;">'''red  '''</span> component) is <math>c.x</math>
*<math>g</math> (the <span style="color:#0c0;">'''green'''</span> component) is <math>c.y</math>
*<math>b</math> (the <span style="color:#66f;">'''blue '''</span> component) is <math>c.z</math>

The formula to mix a list of colors, <math>c_{s}</math>, is this:
*<math>f\left(c_{s}\right)=\frac{\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\cdot\operatorname{mean}\left(\max\left(c_{s}.x,c_{s}.y,c_{s}.z\right)\right)}{\max\left(\frac{\operatorname{total}\left(c_{s}.x\right)}{c_{s}.\operatorname{length}},\frac{\operatorname{total}\left(c_{s}.y\right)}{c_{s}.\operatorname{length}},\frac{\operatorname{total}\left(c_{s}.z\right)}{c_{s}.\operatorname{length}}\right)}</math>

'''Notes:'''
*<math>c_{s}.\operatorname{length}</math> is the total number of colors.
*If the armor is dyed, its color is the first element in <math>c_{s}</math>.
*If the armor is undyed, it has no color.
*The color values of all of the dyes used in the crafting recipe make up the rest of the element in <math>c_{s}</math>.
*Since the [[crafting table]] grid only has 9 slots 1 to 8 dyes can be used, so <math>c_{s}</math> can have anywhere from 1 to 9 element. If the player uses the [[2×2 grid]], then only 1 to 3 dyes can be used, and <math>c_{s}</math> will have 1 to 4 element.

That formula could also be split up like this:
*<math>p_{max}\left(c\right)=\max\left(c.x,c.y,c.z\right)</math>
*<math>\frac{\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\cdot\operatorname{mean}\left(p_{max}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)}{p_{max}\left(\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)}</math>

In the split up formula, <math>\operatorname{mean}\left(p_{max}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)</math> is called the average maximum, and <math>p_{max}\left(\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)</math> is called the maximum average. The average maximum divided by the maximum average is the alpha factor.
*<math>\alpha=\frac{\operatorname{mean}\left(p_{max}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)}{p_{max}\left(\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)}</math>
*Or without the <math>p_{max}</math> function: <math>\frac{\operatorname{mean}\left(\max\left(c_{s}.x,c_{s}.y,c_{s}.z\right)\right)}{\max\left(\frac{\operatorname{total}\left(c_{s}.x\right)}{c_{s}.\operatorname{length}},\frac{\operatorname{total}\left(c_{s}.y\right)}{c_{s}.\operatorname{length}},\frac{\operatorname{total}\left(c_{s}.z\right)}{c_{s}.\operatorname{length}}\right)}</math>

It should also be noted that the exact order of [[w:floating point|floating point]] operations matters.
* <math>x\cdot\frac{y}{z}</math> is not the same as <math>\frac{x\cdot y}{z}</math>.
* <math>f_{a}\left(c_{s}\right)</math> cannot be written as <math>\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\cdot\frac{\operatorname{mean}\left(p_{max}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)}{p_{max}\left(\operatorname{mean}\left(c_{s}\right)\right)}</math>, because some mix operations would give slightly different colors.

In ''Bedrock Edition'', dyes cannot be applied to armor directly and are applied to [[cauldron]] water instead. When a dye is used on undyed cauldron water, the water becomes dyed, and will have the color of that dye. When a dye is used on dyed cauldron water, a simple formula is
*<math>c_{next}=\frac{c_{current}+c_{dye}}{2}</math>

'''Notes:''' (when adding a single dye to dyed cauldron water)
*<math>c_{next}</math> is the color that the dyed water will have after the dye is added.
*<math>c_{current}</math> is the color of the dyed water before the dye is added.
*<math>c_{dye}</math> is the color of the dye.

''Bedrock Edition'' encodes each of these colors as an RGB vector, where each element is a float. The floats range from 0 to 1.
* The first element of the vector is the red component (R) of the color.
* The second element of the vector is the green component (G) of the color.
* The third element of the vector is the blue component (B) of the color.
* A value of <math>x</math> in any given component corresponds to a value of <math>y=\operatorname{round}\left(255\cdot x\right)</math> in the [[w:RGBA|RGBA]] format.
* The [[#Color values|color values]] of the dye items are stored in the RGBA format. To convert a value of <math>x</math> in the RGBA format to a float for the mixing algorithm, the formula <math>x=\frac{y}{255}</math> is used.

The color of the cauldron itself is stored in the ARGB32 format (a type of RGBA), meaning the effective formula is more like this:
*<math>\begin{bmatrix} c_{floatR} \\ c_{floatG} \\ c_{floatB} \end{bmatrix}=c_{next}=\frac{c_{current}+c_{dye}}{510}</math>
*<math>c_{next}=\begin{bmatrix} \operatorname{round}\left(255\cdot c_{floatR}\right) \\ \operatorname{round}\left(255\cdot c_{floatG}\right) \\ \operatorname{round}\left(255\cdot c_{floatB}\right) \end{bmatrix}</math>
*Where <math>c_{next}</math>, <math>c_{current}</math>, and <math>c_{dye}</math> are RGBA vectors, with an implied alpha = 255, in this format: <math>\begin{bmatrix} R \\ G \\ B \end{bmatrix}</math>.

=== Dyeing sheep ===
Dyes can be {{control|use|text=used}} on sheep to change the color of the wool. Shearing a colored sheep drops the corresponding color of the wool, and the sheep retains the color when the wool regenerates. Killing colored sheep drops one block of wool with the corresponding color. [[Breeding]] colored sheep produce a lamb colored as one of the parent sheep, or a color resulting from the combination of both parents' colors. The color combining follows the same rules that dyes use – red and yellow sheep produce an orange lamb, but a blue and yellow sheep cannot create a green lamb. In case the colors of the colored sheep do not mix, the color of a lamb is randomly chosen between the two parents with equal chance. The unlimited reproduction of colored sheep makes dyeing and shearing sheep infinitely more efficient than just dyeing wool directly.

=== Dyeing collars ===
Dye can also be used on a tamed [[wolf]] or [[cat]] to change the color of its collar from the default red to the color of the dye.

=== Dyeing signs ===
Dye can be {{control|used}} on a [[sign]] or a [[hanging sign]] to change the text color. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[ink sac]]s cannot be used for this purpose; black dye must be used to change the text to black. A sign cannot be dyed if its color is already the color of the dye. Attempting to dye it will not use the dye and will open the menu to edit the sign, if possible. A sign defaults to black text when placed.

=== Trading ===
Apprentice, journeyman, and expert-level shepherd [[villager]]s buy 12 of any of the dyes for an [[emerald]].
{{Trade uses|White Dye|Light Gray Dye|Gray Dye|Black Dye|Brown Dye|Red Dye|Orange Dye|Yellow Dye|Lime Dye|Green Dye|Cyan Dye|Light Blue Dye|Blue Dye|Purple Dye|Magenta Dye|Pink Dye}}

== Color values ==
The "color codes" are used to determine the color imparted on [[banner]]s, dyed [[leather armor]], [[leather horse armor]] and [[wolf armor]], [[wolf]] and [[cat]] collars, [[beacon]] beams, [[tropical fish]], [[sheep]], and [[firework star]]s. The hex value is shown in the extended tooltips of dyed armor; however, to set the color using an NBT data tag in a [[command]], the decimal value must be used instead. The color values for firework stars are slightly different. {{IN|java}}, sheep's wool also uses different colors than the base dye values, appearing noticeably darker.

Color codes are usually encoded using the corresponding numeric ID, although e.g. [[sign]]s store the color name instead to represent text color.

*Players can obtain each one of every color with 1 cocoa bean, 2 dandelions/wildflowers or 1 sunflower, 2 ink sacs, 3 cactuses, 4 lapis lazuli or 4 cornflowers, 4 small red flowers (for example, 4 poppies) or 2 rose bushes, and 6 bone meal.
*In ''Bedrock Edition'', tertiary colors, along with their regular crafting recipes, can be crafted with primary colors. For example, magenta can be crafted with one red dye and two white dyes.
