=== General ===
'''[[Experiments]]'''
* All Trails & Tales content has now been “de-experimentified” and is available during normal gameplay.
* Removed the Next Major Update toggle, since it has no active experimental content.
'''[[Settings#Accessibility|Accessibility]]'''
* The four Creative Inventory tabs now have their names read out by text-to-speech.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs" experimental toggle.
===Changes===
'''[[Add-on]]s'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:facing_direction}} state to the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} block trait.
**{{cd|minecraft:facing_direction}} is a six value integer state (down, up, south, west, north, east).
**Can enable and access this state on blocks through the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} trait.
**Can access the {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} state on blocks that apply the {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} trait in {{cd|block_property}} Molang queries and {{cd|set_block_property}} {{cd|EventResponses}}.
*Pumpkin blocks use state {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} instead of {{cd|direction}}.

'''[[API]]'''
*{{cd|@minecraft/server}}
**Renamed {{cd|BlockProperties}} to {{cd|BlockStates}}.
**Renamed {{cd|getAllProperties}} to {{cd|BlockPermutation.getAllStates}}.
**Renamed {{cd|getProperty}} to {{cd|BlockPermutation.getState}}.
