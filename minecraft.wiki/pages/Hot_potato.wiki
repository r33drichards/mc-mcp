A '''hot potato''' is an item which damages players who hold it in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
Throwing a [[potato]], [[poisonous potato]], or a [[baked potato]] into [[lava]] turns it into a hot potato, which is then ejected from lava in a random direction{{more info}}. The hot potato retains data from the original potato, such as its custom name, or how many times it has been [[lubricate]]d.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A1 = Baked Potato
|B1 = Lava Bucket
|Output = Hot potato

}}

== Usage ==
=== Damage ===
Each hot potato stores a heat value. This value starts from 0 and goes up by 1 every tick it is in a player's inventory to a maximum of 200. Once the heat value reaches 20 and the potato is in a player's inventory, the player begins taking damage. Based on the heat value, a player takes between {{hp|1}} and {{hp|5}} damage each tick. However, due to [[damage immunity]], the player only actually takes damage every {{convert|10|ticks|seconds}}.

[[Fire Resistance]] does not prevent the player from taking damage from happening. If there are multiple hot potatoes in a player's inventory, the effect is the same as if there was only one. Hot potatoes do not damage other entities if they hold the item.

=== Food ===
Eating a hot potato restores {{hunger|5}} hunger. When a hot potato is consumed, the player is set on fire for 16940 ticks, or 847 seconds.

=== Burning immunity ===
