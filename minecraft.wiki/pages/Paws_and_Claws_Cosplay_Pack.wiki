'''Paws and Claws Cosplay Pack'''<ref name="mcnet">{{Mcnet|place-bamboo-support-wwf|Place Bamboo, Support WWF!|December 13, 2018|Tom Stone|archive=1}}</ref> is a [[skin pack]] that includes 16 skins themed around cats and pandas, celebrating the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.8.0]] which added pandas and overhauled cats. 62.5% of the skin pack's sales were given to the {{Wikipedia|World Wide Fund for Nature}} to support their work in protecting pandas and other endangered species. At some point, this skin pack was delisted.

The skin pack only includes 16 skins despite the Minecraft.net article stating that it consists of 17 skins.<ref name="mcnet" /> Furthermore, the article includes the [[#Gallery|render of a skin]] (which is also prominetly featured on the pack's key artwork) that is notably absent from the skin pack on the Marketplace. It is unknown if that skin was once part of the pack and removed at some point, or if it was never included in the first place.
