'''Iron chains''' are metallic decoration [[block]]s and the iron variant of the [[chain]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Iron chains can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.

|B2=Iron Ingot
|B3=Iron Nugget
|Output=Iron Chain
|type=Decoration block
}}

=== Natural generation ===
Iron chains can generate in treasure room [[bastion remnant]]s and sometimes in [[ruined portal]]s that generate in [[the Nether]]. They always generate above [[magma cube]] spawners, also found in treasure room bastions.

Iron chains can also generate in [[mineshaft]]s. They generate on the sides of a wooden bridge (a mid-air corridor) when the distance between the bridge and the highest solid block below it is higher than the distance to the lowest solid block above it. Iron chains here generate vertically in a pillar between the bridge and the ceiling. The lowest block of the pillar, connecting the chain to the bridge, is always an [[oak fence]].

In addition, iron chains can also generate in [[trial chambers]] making up various hanging platforms in certain rooms.

== Usage ==
{{for|information about the placement mechanics of all bars|Chain#Usage}}
Iron chains share several common block placement functionalities with copper chains.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, iron chains are not [[conductive]], but the comparator can work in being separated from the measured block by a chain.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* A vertical iron chain, being a solid, but not a full [[block]], allows for many sizes of [[mob]]s and [[player]]s to pass alongside each piece horizontally.
* Despite its name, it cannot be [[craft]]ed into [[chainmail armor]].<ref>{{bug|MC-178979|||Invalid}}</ref>
* Iron chains do not stick together when moved by pistons, regardless of orientation.
