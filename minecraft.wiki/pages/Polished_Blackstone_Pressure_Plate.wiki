A '''polished blackstone pressure plate''' is a polished blackstone variant of the [[pressure plate]] that can detect only [[player]]s and [[mob]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A polished blackstone pressure plate can be mined with anything, but [[pickaxe]]s are the fastest. A polished blackstone pressure plate also breaks and drops itself if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if the block under the pressure plate is moved or destroyed.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Pressure Plate#Usage}}A polished blackstone pressure plate has equivalent functionality as a [[Stone Pressure Plate|stone pressure plate]], except for the lack of functionality as a crafting ingredient.

=== Placement ===
{{main|Pressure Plate#Placement}}
A polished blackstone pressure plate can only be placed on the top of other blocks with either a full solid block face, a solid center, or a solid rim.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuits}}
A polished blackstone pressure plate can be used to detect entities on top of it ([[player]]s, [[mob]]s, and [[armor stand]]s).

==== Activation ====
{{main|Pressure Plate#Activation}}
A polished blackstone pressure plate is activated only by players, mobs, and armor stands, unlike [[wooden pressure plate]]s.

Once activated, a pressure plate checks if entities are still present at regular intervals. A polished blackstone pressure plate checks every 1 second (20 ticks), starting 20 ticks after activation, so it deactivates up to 20 ticks after the last entity has activated it.

Polished blackstone pressure plates are activated by minecarts only if the minecart contains a mob or player.

=== Behavior ===
For polished blackstone pressure plates, the [[Redstone circuits#Power level|power level]] is always 15. 

=== Note blocks ===
Polished blackstone pressure plates can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
