The '''Pan cape'''{{only|JE}} or '''The Pan Cape!'''{{only|BE}} is a [[cape]] given out for free to all players. The name is a pun, as the cape itself is designed to look like a stack of pancakes.

== Appearance ==
The cape features a white plate, on which a stack of pancakes is placed, with a piece of butter on top and syrup dripping down, all on a light blue background. The corresponding elytra looks like a pancake when closed.

== Distribution ==
=== Standard version ===
This cape was originally used as a placeholder to create other capes, such as the [[Founder's Cape]].<ref>{{ytl|uPa4XB95Tos|How To Unlock FREE Emotes, Character Items & NEW Cape In Minecraft 1.16 Nether Update|ECKOSOLDIER|June 24, 2020|t=2m12s}}</ref>

When it first released, players who participated in {{BE}}'s development versions (then called [[Minecraft Preview|Minecraft Beta]]) were able to use the cape temporarily. Since the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.16.0]], this cape has been given out to all {{BE}} players by default. On May 8, 2025, players who owned the cape on ''Bedrock Edition'' were also granted the cape on {{JE}}. You must own ''Bedrock Edition'' and have opened the game to receive the cape on ''Java Edition''.{{verify}}

=== Duplicate version ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
{{main|The Pan Cape! (duplicate)}}
There is a second version of this cape that was originally the [[Mojang Studios Cape]]. However, due to an exploit that allowed non-employees to claim the cape, its texture and name were changed to those of this cape, causing it to appear as a duplicate version of this cape in the inventory of those who claimed it. Its rarity was also changed from Legendary to Common.

Players who were able to claim the duplicated version of this cape can still equip it in the [[Character Creator]].

* This is the only cape to be given out to all players without any known time limit.
* Until the introduction of the [[Common Cape]], the duplicate version of this cape was the only cape to have a rarity other than Legendary.
* This cape was exclusive to {{BE}} for over five years before being made available to {{JE}} players on May 8, 2025.
