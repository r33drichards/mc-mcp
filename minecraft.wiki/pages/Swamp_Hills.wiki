== Description ==
The swamp hills featured hillier terrain rising up between the flat marshes. These hills would tower over the otherwise low-elevation swamp, with some large areas at high elevation without any water. Additionally, flooded areas in swamp hills tended to reach lower depths than the rest of the swamp, sometimes deep enough to have a [[gravel]] floor in place of a dirt floor, like normal [[ocean]]s. [[Swamp hut]]s did not generate in swamp hills{{only|java}}, nor did [[slime]]s spawn, but [[fossil]]s did still generate underground. Additionally, seagrass did not generate in flooded areas of swamp hills. If it connected to a [[jungle]] it had a chance to create a [[modified jungle edge]] biome.

The swamp hills had the same vegetation as the regular swamp, with swamp [[Oak tree|oaks]], [[lily pad]]s, [[blue orchid]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and [[huge mushroom]]s{{Only|BE}}.

Although this biome is called 'swamp hills', it did not actually generate as a 'hills' variant, but as a 'modified' variant of the swamp, making it slightly rarer.

== Mobs ==
Swamp hills used the same mob spawning chances as regular swamps.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
