A '''sapling''' is a non-solid [[block]] that can be grown into a [[tree]].

== Variants ==
* {{BlockLink|Oak Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Birch Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Dark Oak Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Jungle Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Acacia Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Cherry Sapling}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Oak Sapling}}

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Saplings can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] using any tool, including the player's fist, and always drop themselves.
{{breaking row|Saplings|horizontal=1}}

A sapling is removed and drops as an item if:	
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed	
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space	
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space
* {{in|bedrock}}, a [[ravager]] walks on it, except for cherry or pale oak saplings

=== Leaves ===
When [[leaves]] decay, or are broken by any tool except [[shears]] or tools with [[Silk Touch]], they have a 5% chance of dropping a sapling, except for jungle leaves, which have a 2.5% chance of dropping a sapling.
The [[Fortune]] enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% (2.78% for jungle leaves) at level I, 8.33% (3.125% for jungle leaves) at level II, and 10% (4.17% for jungle leaves) at level III.

=== Natural generation ===
; Spruce
Potted spruce saplings generate in [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} [[village]] mason houses.

; Birch
Potted birch saplings generate in the "Large dining room" and "Master bedroom" rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s.

; Dark oak
The "Sapling farm" room in woodland mansions naturally generates with 58 dark oak saplings and a [[chest]] that always contains an additional 28 dark oak saplings.

; Acacia
Two acacia saplings generate in front of each [[savanna]] village library.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|oak-sapling,birch-sapling,spruce-sapling,acacia-sapling,dark-oak-sapling}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 of any sapling for 5 [[emerald]]s.
{{Trade sources|Oak Sapling|Spruce Sapling|Birch Sapling|Jungle Sapling|Acacia Sapling|Dark Oak Sapling|Cherry Sapling|Pale Oak Sapling|Mangrove Propagule}}

== Usage ==
=== Growing trees ===
{{see also|Tree}}

Saplings come in eight varieties, each of which can grow into a corresponding tree: [[oak]], [[birch]], [[spruce]], [[jungle tree|jungle]], [[acacia]], [[dark oak]], [[pale oak]], and [[cherry]].

Saplings can grow into trees when placed on all variants of [[dirt]] (except [[dirt path]]s) or [[moss block]]s. {{IN|JE}} saplings can only be placed on these blocks normally but can still grow on other blocks.

Saplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them using default resources) before growing into trees. [[Bone meal]] can be {{control|used}} to speed up the growth of the sapling, even without sufficient light. Otherwise, the block above the sapling requires a [[light]] level of at least 9 for its growth stage to increase.

Some saplings can be grown in a 2x2 pattern to grow into a bigger tree, and some need to be grown in a 2x2 pattern. The chart below shows which sapling grows into which tree under what condition.

When a tree is to be grown, a height is chosen and the ground and space above are checked; if the ground is bad or there is no space for the chosen height, the tree does not grow. A certain volume of space is required above the sapling, based on its type:

* Oak needs at least 5 spaces above (3×3 column) to grow normally. If a block is present in the growth space (but not directly above the sapling), the tree still grows, but is forced to grow a large variant.
* Birch needs at least 6 spaces above (3×3 column).
* Spruce needs at least 6 spaces above (5×5 column) when placing a single sapling.
** Giant spruce needs at least 14 spaces above (6×6 column{{only|BE}} or 5×5 column centered on the northwest sapling{{only|JE}}) when planted as 4 saplings in a 2×2 square. Also requires the 4×4 area centered on the saplings{{only|BE}} or 3×3 area centered on the northwest sapling{{only|JE}} at the same level to be empty.<ref name="MC-8187">{{Cite bug|MC|8187|Two by two arrangements of jungle or spruce saplings cannot grow into trees when surrounded by snow|date=January 24, 2013}}</ref>
* Jungle needs at least 5 spaces above (3×3 column) when placing a single sapling.
** Giant jungle needs at least 11 spaces above (6×6 column{{only|BE}} or 5×5 column centered on the northwest sapling{{only|JE}}) when planted as 4 saplings in a 2×2 square. Also requires the 3×3 area centered on the saplings and to the north/west of the sapling at the same level to be empty of any type of block, including transparent ones. However, a giant jungle tree can grow if the north/west blocks are any type of log, wood or leaves.<ref name="MC-8187"></ref>
* Acacia needs at least 6 spaces above (5×5 column).
* Dark oak and pale oak need at least 7 spaces above (6×6 column{{only|BE}} or 3×3 column centered on the northwest sapling{{only|JE}}) and must be planted as 4 saplings in a 2×2 square.
* Cherry needs at least 8 spaces above (5×5 column).

In addition:
* A spruce or jungle sapling cannot grow if it is part of a 2×2 square of saplings that doesn't meet the requirements for a giant tree.<!--Tested in 1.16.1-->
* Except for giant jungle and giant spruce (as noted above), sapling growth is not affected by nearby blocks on the same level as the sapling(s).

{{IN|java}}, blocks in the {{cd|#replaceable_by_trees}} [[tag]] are treated as empty, and all types of log blocks, wood blocks, stripped variants, and leaves are exceptions (they don't stop growth). {{IN|bedrock}}, log and wood blocks are treated like other block types and stop the sapling from growing if they are above it.

When a sapling on a [[grass block]] grows into a tree, the grass block becomes a dirt block. {{IN|JE}} most types of saplings also turn [[mycelium]] and any block not in the {{Cd|dirt}} tag under them into dirt when growing, and [[azalea sapling]]s are an exception that turn any block under them into [[rooted dirt]].

=== Bee nests ===
Oak, birch, and cherry [[tree]]s grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any [[flower]], [[flowering azalea]],{{only|je|short=1}} or [[flowering azalea leaves]]{{only|je|short=1}} have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 bees in it.

=== Decoration ===
Any kind of sapling can be placed in a [[flower pot]]. 

=== Fuel ===
Saplings can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.5 items per sapling.

=== Composting ===
Placing a sapling into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of saplings yields an average of 2.74 [[bone meal]].

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w25a|Saplings are now defined via [[block states]] rather than by numerical metadata. Prior to this version, the numerical metadata variants of sapling were as follows:

|{{HistoryLine||1.17|dev=21w19a|<code>#minecraft:saplings</code> has been added to the newly-implemented <code>#minecraft:mineable/axe</code> [[block tag]]. This, however, has no effect in-game, since the blocks break instantly anyway regardless of tool used or active effects.{{check the code|Prior to this version, assigned tools were presumably hardcoded; were saplings also coded to have axes as their "preferred" tool before this version?}}}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.21.5|dev=25w10a|<code>#minecraft:saplings</code> has been removed from the block tags <code>#minecraft:mineable/axe</code> and <code>#minecraft:sword_efficient</code>.}}

== Trivia ==
* If the [[player]] stands on the same [[block]] as a placed [[tree]] sapling, the tree still grows over the player, causing [[suffocation]] as it pushes the player out of the block.
