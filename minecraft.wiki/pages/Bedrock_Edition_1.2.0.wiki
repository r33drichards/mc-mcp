{{relevant guide|Bedrock Edition guides/Better Together Update}}

'''1.2.0''', the first release of the '''[[Better Together Update]]''', is a first release of ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' or simply ''Minecraft''. ''Bedrock Edition'' is a continuation of ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' and its derived editions. It added support for the [[wikipedia:Xbox One|Xbox One]], introduced cross-platform gameplay, and brought the vanilla game much closer to feature parity with {{el|console}} by adding features such as new world options, [[armor stand]]s, [[banner]]s, [[jukebox]]es, [[book and quill]]s, [[firework]]s, and [[parrot]]s. It was released on September 20, 2017, although the full rollout took a few days due to a large number of distribution channels and target devices involved. It should also be noted that there is no changelog documenting differences between this update and the last version of ''[[Xbox One Edition]]''.

* Crafted like signs, but with one color of wool instead of planks.
** The color of wool represents the base color.
* Can be stacked to 16.
* Most patterns are created by arranging dyes in certain ways around a banner on a crafting table (see the page on banners for a full list).
** Other patterns are achieved with specific items.
*** Item – pattern: "creeper head – creeper face", "wither skeleton skull – skull and crossbones", "brick block – brick texture background", "oxeye daisy – flower icon", "vines – curly border" and "enchanted golden apple – Mojang logo.
*** Making these patterns without dyes results in a black color by default
* Banners can have up to six layers (in survival).
** Over a quadrillion possible combinations, counting rotations and visually identical patterns due to occlusion.
** The layers show in the order they were created.
** Custom banners with more than six layers are possible using commands.
* Top-most layer can be removed using cauldrons.
** This removes a third of the water of a full cauldron.
** All layers can be removed.
* Can be placed on walls or on the ground.
* They are visually like an entity that is one block wide and two blocks tall, but in reality, they are a block occupying the lower portion, but having a bigger model.
** The hitbox is smaller than a full block, and it lacks any collision properties.
*** This allows for a solid block to occupy the upper portion of the banner.
** They are vulnerable to being destroyed by either water or lava flows.
** On the ground, they have 16 different possible rotations (like an [[armor stand]]).
** Has an animation when placed on the ground, that simulates swaying with the wind.
* Can be worn as headgear, but only using the {{cmd|replaceitem}} command.
* Can be cloned by crafting them together, with a blank banner of the corresponding base color.
* Can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s.
