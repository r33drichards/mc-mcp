'''Bluestone dust''' is an animation error from the [[Village & Pillage: Official Trailer|official trailer]] for [[Village & Pillage]].

== History ==
Prior to the animation error incident, bluestone was already a term within the ''[[Minecraft]]'' community, describing a variation of [[redstone dust]] that is blue instead of red. It became a common suggestion as a way to run two unconnected sets of wires next to each other.<ref>{{ytl|9qO7325uDl4|Minecraft: Blue Redstone <nowiki>[Minecraft 15w14a Snapshot]</nowiki>|[[Mumbo Jumbo]]|April 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Reddit2|sub=minecraft|text=My idea for simple more compact redstone: bluestone!|author=[https://www.reddit.com/user/Hypetic Hypetic]|date=July 8|id=ikb0p}}</ref>

In the [[Village & Pillage: Official Trailer|official trailer]] for [[Village & Pillage]], a piece of blue dust could be seen as a reward given out by [[villager]]s due to [[Hero of the Village]]. It was likely meant to be [[gunpowder]] rather than redstone, because [[redstone dust]] was given out before by the same villager, and none of the other villagers dropped the same exact item twice. Gunpowder is the only other powder-like item that cleric villagers give out under the conditions.

This led to rumors of it being a teaser for the following update,<ref>{{Reddit2|sub=Minecraft|text=Bluestone?

(Read description)|Electro Games|May 4, 2019}}</ref> with some speculating it to be the previously mentioned bluestone dust. Others thought it would be {{w|cobalt}} and the next update would be called "Combat and Cobalt."<ref>{{ytl|qCRBJohr6cM|did we just GUESS what Minecraft 1.15 is?!|AntVenom|May 4, 2019}}</ref> Another factor was the [[Java Edition Combat Tests]], which many assumed at the time were building up to the immediately proceeding update.

It was later clarified that the dust was erroneously colored blue and not a hint at a future feature.<ref>{{tweet|Chupacaubrey|1125130466955108353|Hey! Apparently there was a weird rendering error in the Village & Pillage trailer where some redstone wound up looking blue. This was not intentional. 😬 Just a mistake and not a reference or tease to anything. Sorry! 🙇🏻‍♀️|May 5, 2019|archive=yes|archiveid=20190710053222}}</ref>

Mojang has stated that they have and still will reject suggestions for bluestone and said that they will focus on adding more to existing redstone systems.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360005029872-Previously-Considered-Suggestions|title=Previously Considered Suggestions|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=May 7, 2020}}</ref>
