=== Note blocks ===
Quartz slabs can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==

* Because of the low blast resistance of regular quartz blocks, it may be preferable to use two quartz slabs or smooth quartz blocks when making fortifications using quartz, as their blast resistance is higher than the other quartz block variants.
