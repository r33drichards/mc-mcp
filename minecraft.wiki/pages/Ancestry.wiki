[[File:Ancestry.ogg]]

This song is meant to provide the ambient eerie energy inherent to the deep dark, consisting of mostly background music that adds a sense of unease. In the beginning, the song consists mostly of hollow ringing with static. This is supplemented by very quiet keyboard tones that chain into the different ringing tones. Further in, the song is mostly a repeating background part with spontaneous piano for ambience. Overall, the song is very blended together, with nothing really standing out from the rest; this helps to make the music stay in the background. After about 5 minutes, the song fades with sounds almost similar to a Sculk shrieker heard in the background.
