The '''windswept gravelly hills''' or '''extreme hills mutated''' is a slightly altered and more desolate variant of the [[windswept hills]] covered with [[gravel]]. It is one of the rarest biomes in the [[Overworld]], second only to the [[pale garden]], covering only about 0.103% of the world terrain.

== Description ==
[[File:Windswept Gravelly Hills BE.png|thumb|Windswept gravelly hills in ''Bedrock Edition''.|left]]
True to its name, windswept gravelly hills contain large amounts of [[gravel]] that replace the top few layers of [[stone]], [[grass blocks]], and [[dirt]] across its landscape. Due to the gravel replacing most of the grass, [[Spruce|spruce trees]] and [[Oak|oak trees]] generate far less often, along with reduced amounts of [[dandelion]]s, [[poppies]], [[bush]]es, and [[short grass]], making this variant relatively barren. {{IN|be}}, no [[trees]] generate here at all, and almost 100% of the biome is covered with gravel, with only a few 1-block wide strips of grass blocks generating inside, allowing far fewer bushes to generate. Players should be careful when surfacing from underground in this biome, as the top layers of gravel can pose a suffocation hazard.  

In other aspects, however, windswept gravelly hills resemble their regular counterpart: the terrain is still elevated and full of falling hazards, and generates hilly and shattered in some areas, often resulting in [[floating islands]]. Above Y=120±8, rainfall converts to [[snowfall]], and [[snow]] begins to cover the ground. [[Water]] also begins to freeze into [[ice]] starting at that height.  

Windswept gravelly hills share their foliage, grass and water color with windswept hills and [[windswept forests]]. [[Emerald ore]] generates here. On the biome's surface, [[coal ore]] and [[iron ore]] is found frequently exposed to broad daylight. Underground, occasional [[infested stone]] with [[silverfish]] can be encountered. The [[deep dark]] cannot generate beneath windswept gravelly hills, despite being a highland biome. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], windswept gravelly hills use default environmental settings with a coolish color grading, making the biome appear colder blue. 

Farm animals spawn their cold variants in this biome when possible, and [[Llama|llamas]] generate in herds around the biome. 

This variant rarely generates in lower [[humidity]] values and colder [[temperature]] ranges than regular windswept hills and [[windswept forests]]. Because of this, windswept gravelly hills often appear next to [[plains]], [[snowy plains]], [[ice spikes]], [[snowy taiga]]s, and uncommonly [[forest]]s, [[sunflower plains]], and [[flower forest]]s. As the biome is a variant of the windswept hills, additional requirements for locating the biome are high [[World generation|PV]] and high [[World generation|erosion]] values. On top of that, all windswept hills biomes are more likely to generate in higher [[continentalness]].
