'''[[Allay]]s'''
* Can now dance when a nearby [[jukebox]] is playing.
* If an allay is given an [[amethyst shard]] while dancing, it can "duplicate", creating another allay and consuming the shard.

** The newly created allay does not share the original allay's properties (such as custom name).
** Controlled by a {{nbt|byte|CanDuplicate}} tag (set to true by default).

* The <code>style</code> field default value is no longer present in the JSON file for chat types.
* {{samp|game_info.json}} now contains a narration setting by default.

'''[[Pause menu]]'''
* The social interactions screen is now available via the pause screen when in a multiplayer game.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* Added 3 new icon for the report chat function in {{samp|social_interactions.png}}.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>jukebox_play</code> and <code>jukebox_stop_play</code> game events into the <code>#vibrations</code> and <code>#warden_can_listen</code> game event tags.
