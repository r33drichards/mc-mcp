'''22w05a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18.2]], released on February 2, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w05a|February 2, 2022}}</ref> which reverts changes to [[badlands]] in the previous snapshot, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[Badlands]]'''
* Reverted changes in [[22w03a]] to avoid causing generation changes and chunk borders.
** This change will be re-introduced later.

'''[[Superflat]]'''
* "Redstone Ready" preset's top layer of blocks has increased to height Y=55 instead of Y=-9 in order to prevent [[slime]]s from spawning.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed [[dirt]] from the <code>#dripstone_replaceable_blocks</code> block tag.
