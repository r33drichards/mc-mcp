'''18w07a''' is the eighteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on February 14, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w07a|February 14, 2018}}</ref>. It is the first snapshot to include the [[Update Aquatic]] features, although the decision to include them in 1.13 happened two weeks prior. This snapshot contains more gameplay additions than the previous snapshots for 1.13, which mostly added or modified commands.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Stripped Oak Log (UD) JE1 BE1.png; Stripped Spruce Log (UD) JE1.png; Stripped Birch Log (UD) JE1 BE1.png; Stripped Jungle Log (UD) JE1 BE1.png; Stripped Acacia Log (UD) JE1 BE1.png; Stripped Dark Oak Log (UD) JE1.png|32px}} [[Stripped log]]'''

'''[[File:Bubble Column JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bubble column]]'''
* Created by [[magma block]]s or [[soul sand]] in water at least 2 blocks deep.
** Magma blocks columns push entities down: they prevent items from floating up in water and sink boats.
** Soul sand columns push entities up.

'''[[File:Kelp JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Kelp]]'''
* Generates in ocean biomes, except warm oceans.
* Can be placed only underwater, requiring at least one water block above it.
* Can grow multiple blocks high.

'''[[File:Seagrass JE1 BE2.gif|32px]] [[Sea grass]]'''
* Can only be placed underwater, requiring at least one water block above it.
** Can be placed on dry land by using the {{cmd|setblock}} command.
* Generates in [[ocean]]s.
* Has animated textures.
* Also comes in a tall variant.
* Can be generated when using [[bone meal]] on any block underwater.

'''[[File:Dried Kelp Block JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Dried kelp block]]'''

'''{{Animate|Prismarine Stairs JE1 BE1.png; Prismarine Slab JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Prismarine stairs]] and [[Prismarine Slab|slabs]]'''
* Added prismarine variants of slabs and stairs.

'''{{Animate|Turtle Egg 1 JE1.png; Turtle Egg 1 (slightly cracked) JE1.png; Turtle Egg 1 (very cracked) JE1.png|32px}} [[Turtle egg]]s'''
* Stepping on turtle eggs breaks them.
** Zombies and zombie pigmen intentionally step on turtle eggs.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Invicon Trident Revision 1.png|32px]] [[Trident]]'''
* Can be thrown by {{control|using}} it, or be used as a melee weapon by {{control|attacking}}, dealing {{health|9}} damage.
* Are currently unobtainable in Survival mode.

'''[[File:Kelp (item) JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Kelp]]'''
* Kelp item can be used to place a kelp plant underwater.
* Can also be dried in a furnace to create dried kelp.

'''[[File:Dried Kelp JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Dried kelp]]'''
* Can be eaten, restoring {{hunger|1}} hunger point.

'''[[File:Turtle Scute JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Turtle shell piece]]s'''
* Dropped when baby turtles grow up.
* Can be used to craft [[turtle shell]]s.

'''[[File:Turtle Shell (item) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Turtle shell]]'''
* Can be used as a helmet, adding 2 armor points.
** While equipped and out of water, it gives the player the [[Water Breathing]] effect for 10 seconds, essentially giving the player 10 extra seconds of breath underwater.
* Can be used to brew the [[potion of the Turtle Master]] from an [[awkward potion]].

'''[[File:Potion of the Turtle Master JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Potion of the Turtle Master]]'''
* Gives [[Slowness]] IV and [[Resistance]] IV for 1 minute.
* Brewing it with [[redstone dust]] extends the effect time to 3 minutes.
* Brewing it with [[glowstone dust]] increases the effect amplifiers from IV to VI.
** As any level of Resistance beyond IV reduces damage by 100%, enhanced potion of Turtle Master effectively grants invincibility for a minute.
* Brewing it with [[gunpowder]] or [[dragon's breath]] creates a [[splash potion|splash]] or [[lingering potion]], respectively.

'''[[File:Arrow of the Turtle Master JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Arrow of the Turtle Master]]'''
* Gives the same effects as [[potion of the Turtle Master]].

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''

** Used on tridents to summon a [[lightning bolt]] on impact with a mob during [[thunderstorm]]s.
*** Requires the target mob to be directly under an open sky and in a biome where it is raining.

'''[[Movement]]'''
* When sprinting while swimming, the player now goes much faster than normal swimming, and rapidly dive down to the lowest point in the body of water.
** The player's hitbox is only as large as 0.6×0.6 blocks (same as while flying with an [[elytra]]) while doing this.
** Vertically, the player can fit through a one block gap like this.
*** If the ceiling block is solid, movement is very slow while in such a small space, for any other ceiling block (like a bottom slab) movement speed is as normal.
