===Technical===
'''[[Add-on]]s and Script Engine'''
* The {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} identifier for the {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component has been added
** The {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} identifier provides a centered 1x1x1 cube geometry

*** Occludes both vanilla and custom neighboring full blocks
*** Culls faces that neighbor vanilla and custom neighboring full blocks to improve rendering performance
'''General'''
* Updated listed values for the Vanilla {{cd|orientation}} block state in documentation
'''[[API]]'''
* Added Biome Registry biome names and {{cd|StructureFeatureType}} enum to vanilla metadata generation
'''Components'''
* Added an {{cd|interact_filters}} field to the {{cd|ageable}} component, which allows to specify conditions on when the actor can be fed
'''[[Molang]]'''
* Released Molang queries from experimental
** {{cd|query.is_cooldown_type}}
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time}}
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time_remaining}}
** {{cd|query.relative_block_has_any_tag}}
** {{cd|query.relative_block_has_all_tags}}
** {{cd|query.block_neighbor_has_any_tag}}
** {{cd|query.block_neighbor_has_all_tags}}
** {{cd|query.block_has_any_tag}}
** {{cd|query.block_has_all_tags}}
** {{cd|query.bone_orientation_trs}}
** {{cd|query.bone_orientation_matrix}}

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Armadillo and Wolf Armor", "Update 1.21", "Beta APIs", "Molang", and "Upcoming Creator Features" experimental toggles.
===Additions===
==== Mobs ====
'''[[Armadillo]]'''
*Added the Armadillo
*The Armadillo is a neutral mob.<ref name=ref3>Despite being referred to as a neutral mob on [[minecraft.net]], the armadillo is just a passive mob with a defense mechanic</ref>
*Drops Armadillo Scutes periodically
*Drops Armadillo Scutes when brushed
*Spawns in Savannas
*Favorite food is Spider Eyes
* When an Armadillo detects a threat, it rolls up
** Threats are:
*** Players who are sprinting
*** Players on a mount or in a vehicle
*** Undead mobs
** It does not roll up if it is fleeing, in water, in the air, or if being led
** When an Armadillo is rolled up it does not walk, cannot eat, and will not be tempted by food
** It continues to scan for threats, and if there are no threats detected for 3 seconds, it will unroll

==== Items ====
'''[[Armadillo Scute]]s'''
* Can be used to craft Wolf Armor
* Dropped by Armadillos
* Dispensers can be used to brush Armadillo Scutes off Armadillos
'''[[Wolf Armor]]'''
* Using Wolf Armor on an adult tamed Wolf will equip the armor on the Wolf
** Only a Wolf's owner can put Wolf Armor on their tamed Wolf, and with this in mind, Dispensers cannot put Wolf Armor on Wolves
* Using Shears on a Wolf that is wearing armor will make it drop the armor
** Only a Wolf's owner can shear a Wolf Armor from it, and with this in mind, Dispensers cannot remove Wolf Armor from Wolves
* Wolf Armor gives the same protection as Diamond Horse Armor
* If a Wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor

====Command format====
* Added a new {{cmd|hud}} command that will hide and reset HUD elements visibility.
** {{cd|/hud hide <hud element>}}
** {{cd|/hud reset <hud element>}}
* The HUD elements available are:
**{{cd|paperdoll}}
**{{cd|armor}}
**{{cd|tooltips}}
**{{cd|touch_controls}}
**{{cd|crosshair}}
**{{cd|hotbar}}
**{{cd|health}}
**{{cd|progress_bar}}
**{{cd|hunger}}
**{{cd|air_bubbles}}
**{{cd|horse_health}}
**{{cd|all}}

====Technical====
'''[[API]]'''
*Added item dynamic properties
**Added function {{cd|clearDynamicProperties(): void}} - Removes all dynamic properties from the item stack
**Added function {{cd|getDynamicProperty(identifier: string): boolean | number | string | Vector3 | undefined}} - Returns the value of the dynamic property with the given identifier if it exists, otherwise returns undefined
**Added function {{cd|getDynamicPropertyIds(): string[]}} - Returns an array of all dynamic property identifiers on the item stack
**Added function {{cd|getDynamicPropertyTotalByteCount(): number}} - Returns the total byte count of all dynamic properties on the item stack
**Added function {{cd|setDynamicProperty(identifier: string, value?: boolean | number | string | Vector3): void}} - Sets the value of the dynamic property with the given identifier. If the value is undefined, the dynamic property will be removed.
*Added class {{cd|EntityProjectileComponent}}. This component is used to shoot a projectile entity and modify its properties
*Added interface {{cd|ProjectileShootOptions}}. This interface is used with function {{cd|EntityProjectileComponent.shoot}} to optionally modify the accuracy of the projectile when shot

=== Changes ===
====Blocks====
'''[[Trial Spawner]]'''
* Trial Spawner randomizes the loot table only once each combat, for all players
====Mobs====
'''[[Breeze]]'''
* Updated sounds.
====Technical====
'''[[Add-on]]s and Script Engine'''
* The {{cd|minecraft:unit_cube}} block component has been deprecated. Using it in content marked 1.20.60 and beyond will provide a content error
** Using content marked prior to 1.20.60 will have their {{cd|minecraft:unit_cube}} block component upgraded to a {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component with a {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} identifier, but will maintain backwards compatibility with all behaviors
'''[[API]]'''
*Updated function {{cd|addEffect}} to return the added effect (or undefined if it failed).
'''[[Molang]]'''
* Changed cooldown query slot IDs to be required for container slots with more than one index, logging content errors if not provided
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time(slotName,slotId)}}
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time_remaining(slotName,slotId)}}
** {{cd|query.is_cooldown_type(cooldownName,slotName,slotId)}}
