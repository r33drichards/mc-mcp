A '''flower forest''' is a variant of the [[forest]] filled with a much larger variation and frequency of [[flower]]s. [[Rabbit]]s spawn here instead of wolves and [[bee nest]]s generate much more often.

== Description ==
Flower forests have both [[oak]] and [[birch]] trees. They generate with a wide array of [[flower]]s, along with [[bee nest]]s on 5% of [[tree]]s. Like almost every other Overworld biome, [[lava lake]]s can generate, which can cause small forest [[fire]]s due to the density of flammable [[wood]] and [[leaves]]. The same goes for fire caused by [[lightning]] strikes, although the fire caused by the strikes are usually extinguished by [[rain]].

=== Generation ===
Flower forests generate in medium [[World generation#Biomes|temperature ranges]] and in low [[humidity]], and are rarer than standard [[forest]] biomes. They are most commonly bordered by [[plains]] and [[meadow]] biomes or separated from [[sunflower plains]], which generate in place of a flower forest in high [[weirdness]], by [[river]]s. Flower forests make up about 0.642% of the [[Overworld]] by area.

=== Differences to regular forests ===
There are some key differences between regular forests and flower forests.

* Flower forests have fewer trees and less [[grass]]. Instead, flower forests include a diverse variety of flowers. [[Leaf litter]] and [[bush]]es are completely absent.
* The vast number of flowers makes this biome variant an excellent source of [[dye]]s. The following types of flowers can be generated in flower forests:
** {{BlockLink|Allium}}
** {{BlockLink|Azure Bluet}}
** {{BlockLink|Cornflower}}
** {{BlockLink|Dandelion}}
** {{BlockLink|Lily of the Valley}}
** {{BlockLink|Oxeye Daisy}}
** {{BlockLink|Poppy}}
** {{BlockLink|Orange Tulip}}
** {{BlockLink|Pink Tulip}}
** {{BlockLink|Red Tulip}}
** {{BlockLink|White Tulip}}
** {{BlockLink|Lilac}}
** {{BlockLink|Peony}}
** {{BlockLink|Rose Bush}}
* The following flowers do ''not'' generate in flower forests:
** {{BlockLink|Sunflower}} 
** {{BlockLink|Blue orchid}}
** {{BlockLink|Eyeblossom}}
** {{BlockLink|Torchflower}}
** {{BlockLink|Pitcher plant}}
** {{BlockLink|Wither rose}} 
* There is a 10x greater chance of generating a [[bee nest]].
* Flower forests are much rarer than regular forest biomes.
* There is also a slight difference in mob spawning:
** {{EntityLink|Wolf|Wolves}} cannot spawn in flower forests.
** {{EntityLink|rabbit|Rabbits}} can spawn in flower forests.
** {{EntityLink|Bee|Bees}} also occur 10x more often, as there is 10x higher chance of spawning a [[bee nest]] with a tree.
