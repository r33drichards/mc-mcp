'''Wind Burst''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[mace]]s that causes a powerful upward [[knockback]] effect to be created upon executing a [[smash attack]]. Unlike [[wind charge]]s, Wind Burst does not negate fall damage.

== Obtaining ==
Wind Burst can only be obtained from [[ominous vault]]s in [[trial chambers]] in the form of [[enchanted book]]s at level I. It is a rare enchantment, having a 5.5% chance of being ejected from an ominous vault.

== Usage ==
[[File:Using Wind Burst On Husk.gif|thumb|Wind Burst launching a player into the air after using a smash attack.]]
When executing a [[smash attack]] using a [[mace]] enchanted with Wind Burst, the user is launched back into the air, allowing them to chain continuous smash attacks. Attacks on the ground do not activate Wind Burst, as the activation requires a smash attack.

In order to perform a smash attack, and in turn activate Wind Burst, a player has to fall more than 1.5 blocks. This can be achieved by jumping off a single block placed on the ground and attacking right before touching the ground (total fall height of ~2 blocks), or alternatively by using a [[wind charge]] or the [[Jump Boost]] effect.

The slow attack speed of the mace in ''Java Edition'' makes it impossible to chain fully-charged smash attacks with Wind Burst I on a target that stays at the same elevation.<ref>{{bug|MC-272819||Mace attack speed 0.6 causes Wind Burst 1 smash attacks to be performed on uncharged attacks|Unresolved}}</ref>

Like wind charges, Wind Burst can interact with redstone objects such as [[lever]]s or [[wooden door]]s.

Since [[Fox|foxes]] can attack mobs by pouncing on them, a fox given a mace enchanted with Wind Burst is capable of activating it. This is of little benefit to the fox, as it will typically fail to chain a second smash attack and will thus take [[fall damage]]. 

=== Launch power per level ===
Wind Burst adds approximately 8 blocks of upward [[knockback]] for the first level, 16 blocks for the second level, and 24 blocks for the third level. [[Blast Protection]] reduces the effect of Wind Burst{{only|je}}. The table below details the explosion knockback multiplier and blocks launched per level.

|+Wind Burst knockback multiplier

!III
|-
|1.2x (8 blocks)
|1.75x (16 blocks)
|2.2x (24 blocks)
|}

Further Wind Burst levels use the formula <code>1.15 + 0.35 * level</code> to calculate the knockback multiplier.

=== On other items ===
If Wind Burst is applied to an item other than a mace by use of commands or [[anvil]]s in [[Creative]] mode {{in|java}}, Wind Burst activates after the player has fallen at least 1.5 blocks. The launch from Wind Burst doesn't boost the player as high, since landing hits with any other item does not reset vertical [[velocity]] unlike the mace. The faster the player falls while hitting an entity, the less it is launched upwards, since gravity and the enchantment are close to causing a force equilibrium.<ref>{{bug|MC-271920||Wind Burst launch is inconsistent when applied to weapons other than a mace|Won't Fix}}</ref>
