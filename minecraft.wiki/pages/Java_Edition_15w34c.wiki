'''15w34c''' is the twelfth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on August 21, 2015<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/08/minecraft-snapshot-15w34a/</ref> mainly to extend features added in [[15w34a]] and [[15w34b]].

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Particles]]'''
* New <code>sweepAttack</code> particle.
** Used for the new defensive "sweep" attack.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Axe]]s'''
* New offensive attack.
** Hitting another player who is blocking with a [[shield]] has a chance to disable the player's shield for 5 seconds.
*** 25% base chance, plus 5 percentage points for each level of [[Efficiency]] on the axe, plus 75 percentage points if sprinting.
*** This is visible on the shield icon through a "rolling curtain" animation.

'''[[Chorus fruit]] & [[ender pearl]]s'''
* Now have a cooldown every time they are used.
** Have the same animation as the shields.
* Chorus fruits can no longer teleport the player on top of [[the Nether]] roof.

'''[[Sword]]s'''
* New defensive attack while crouching or standing and having a full damage bar.
** Mobs near the one hit (bounding box expanded by 1 block horizontally and 0.25 vertically) and within 3 blocks of the attacker are knocked back without damage. Knockback is 80% of that done by Knockback I and is not affected by the Knockback enchantment.
*** Creates a sweep attack particle.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Combat'''
* [[Critical hit]]s and [[sprint-knockback attack]]s now require an attack cooldown percentage of 84.8% or greater.
* Added the attack speed tooltip.
* When an attack is blocked by a [[shield]], the attacker may be knocked back.
* Different attack speeds and damages for different tools.
** [[Hoe]]s are the fastest, but only slightly more powerful than before, [[axe]]s are much more powerful, but are also the slowest.
