A '''poppy''' is a red [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[red dye]] and [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A poppy can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A poppy also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Poppy|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Poppies generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in the following biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features:

{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{BiomeLink|Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Sunflower Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Savanna}}
* {{BiomeLink|Savanna Plateau}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Savanna}}

* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Gravelly Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Windswept Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|River}}
* {{BiomeLink|Frozen River}}
}}

The following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate poppies, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, poppies can generate only in edge cases or [[custom]] worlds.

In [[jungle]]s, [[bamboo jungle]]s, [[sparse jungle]]s, [[savanna]]s and [[savanna plateau]]s, poppies are twice as common as in other biomes. In [[flower forest]]s and [[meadow]]s, poppies only generate as part of [[Flower#Flower gradients|gradients]].

Natural poppies are found in plains, savanna, and taiga [[village]]s, as well as snowy villages {{in|bedrock}}. Potted poppies can also generate in [[woodland mansion]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

==== {{JE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in one of the biomes listed [[#Natural generation|above]] (except those marked as {{only|bedrock}}), poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, poppies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, poppies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

==== {{BE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in any biome except [[forest]], [[birch forest]], [[old growth birch forest]], [[dark forest]], [[swamp]], and [[pale garden]], poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, poppies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. Unlike {{el|java}}, bone meal can generate poppies anywhere within a meadow biome. In plains and sunflower plains; poppies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a poppy in any biome, more poppies appear on top of nearby grass blocks. [[Dandelion]]s can also occasionally appear, and poppies can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to dandelions. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Iron golem]]s drop 0-2 poppies upon death. This is unaffected by the [[Looting]] enchantment.

[[Endermen]] can pick up poppies, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

Iron golems sometimes plant a decorative poppy onto a nearby [[copper golem]], which is removed when the copper golem turns into a [[copper golem statue]] or when the copper golem is [[shear]]ed.

{{IN|je}}, baby [[villager]]s may give a poppy to [[player]]s with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.

{{Drop sources|Poppy}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|poppy}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell a poppy for 1 emerald.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, poppies can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Poppies can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a poppy imparts the {{EffectLink|Night Vision}} effect for 5 seconds. It can be crafted using a poppy or produced by feeding a poppy to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with poppies, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding===
Poppies can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a poppy have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a poppy into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of poppies (64) yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
