=== ''Guardian Tales'' ===
In World 22: Mount Volver of ''Guardian Tales'', a new puzzle mechanic was introduced where the player can use water to solidify lava. In the second stage of this world, there is a side quest that begins when the player completes a portal frame made of solidified lava. When the puzzle is solved, the frame activates and a purple portal appears. From it, an NPC resembling [[Steve]] named Sting and a chicken emerge.

Sting wonders where they are, and the player can respond in several ways such as welcoming them, asking for emerald armor in exchange, or questioning if they came from lava and whether they are resistant to fire types. After observing the hot environment, Sting declares their travel a success. He explains that they have been traveling across the world to create the best lava chicken, repeatedly entering the wrong portals until now. After inspecting the lava, he deems its properties perfect.

Sting then destroys an indestructible rock using a golden pickaxe, places the chicken in a building with a furnace, and a parody of the [[Movie:Steve's Lava Chicken (song)|Steve's Lava Chicken]] song plays. The player can help by opening passages and clearing obstacles for the lava flow. Once the lava reaches the chicken, Sting sings, and after it is cooked, both Sting and the player character eat it.

Finally, Sting expresses satisfaction and prepares to go home. However, when he checks his map, he is shocked to find that he is 12,345 / -2399 / 999 XYZ coordinates away from the village he built where his 48 cats live, and he laments that all his looting was pointless. A star piece then drops from him.

Later, in the final stage after the Eternal Flame was defeated, Sting appears in the human village of the volcanic region, saying it is a great village to rob, quickly correcting himself and saying he means to build a house there.<gallery>
