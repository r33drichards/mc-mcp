'''Realms Celebration Map''' is a [[Marketplace]] map, designed to be used by subscribers of [[Realms]]. The player is placed in a world composed of many minigames, often themed around mobs, with the goal of collecting [[Eye of Ender|eyes of ender]] to reach the [[Ender Dragon|ender dragon]].

== Areas ==
The player spawns inside of a citadel in the center of the map, with two [[Lectern|lecterns]] holding a [[Book and Quill|guest book]] that explain the objective of the map, one to the player's right and another above a recreational stage. In turn, around the stage's lectern are a [[jukebox]] and a [[barrel]] containing many [[Music Disc|music discs]], and underneath it is a [[lever]] labeled "party time," which activates a dance floor made of [[Stained Glass|stained glass]], [[redstone lamp]]s, and numerous [[beacon]]s. Across from the stage, there is a small laboratory consisting of multiple [[brewing stand]]s, holding [[potions of swiftness]] and [[leaping]]. In the corner of the building are three [[cake]]s, as well as a chest containing [[Wool|red wool]].

Outside the building, there are many novelties. Right outside the doors are chests with food, and in front of those are dispensers that shoot [[Firework Rocket|fireworks]]. Surrounding the building is a ring of [[Slime Block|slime blocks]], and around that is a functional piano made to sing Happy Birthday using [[Note Block|note blocks]] and [[Pressure Plate|pressure plates]]. Behind the building is a console to select which instrument to use, and surrounding the building is a large track of [[ice]]. Opposite to the piano controls is a collection of oak, spruce, birch, dark oak, jungle, and acacia [[Boat|boats]], with the expectation of racing on the ice track. Throughout the track, there are several traps, in particular [[Blue Ice|blue ice]] blockages achieved through [[piston]]s.

Before every minigame is also a collection of chunks, with a renewable chest of supplies to build on it, including [[concrete]], [[cobblestone]], [[Planks|oak planks]], oak [[Door|doors]], [[glass]], oak [[Fence|fences]], oak [[Log|logs]], dark oak [[Sign|signs]], and [[scaffolding]].

=== The Floor is Lava ===
Based within a modified [[Desert Pyramid|desert pyramid]], the player is given a [[Diamond Shovel|diamond shovel]] enchanted with [[efficiency]] and have to tunnel through narrow paths covered in [[sand]], above a floor of [[lava]]. When entered, the player sets off a [[Light Weighted Pressure Plate|weighted pressure plate]] that kills [[Husk|husks]], and throughout the structure must press pressure plates that spawn husks to progress. Tiptoeing over various blocks, such as [[Wall|sandstone walls]], [[Trapdoor|spruce trapdoors]], and [[End Rod|end rods]], the minigame ends when the player finds a chest with a single eye of ender.

=== Slime Bounce ===
Approaching Slime Bounce, the player finds two statues of [[Slime|slimes]]; one for decoration, the other holding the minigame. After platforming across lime stained glass blocks, the player arrives in a playground made almost entirely out of slime blocks. Among the few exceptions are 2×2 platforms of lime stained glass, and [[water]] streams that are used to gain height from bouncing. A player who makes enough progress across the path of glass blocks finds a chest containing a single eye of ender.

=== Archery adventure ===
Set inside of a fortified [[forest]], players will find the entrance (an [[iron door]] inside of a large [[fallen tree]]) locked. In order to open it, they will need to {{Control|use}} a bow or crossbow from a nearby chest, activating three [[button]]s installed on a redstone lamp, one built into an [[oak]], another on a fallen trunk, and a third hidden behind the tree. The first room of the attraction is a brief corridor fenced from a display forest, with a button visible. Activating it with the ranged weapon will cause a set of pistons to retract, revealing another button behind a set of logs, which in turn reveals a third behind a single log. With all three buttons pressed, the player can progress to the next room, a narrower stretch beside the forest leading up to a small hill.

The second set of targets are a set of redstone lamps bobbing up and down. Instead of buttons, the aim is to shoot at [[light weighted pressure plate]]s, which can be blocked by the lamps. Through the next door, the player can pass a statue of a [[skeleton]], and then enter a slightly larger forest. Behind a set of [[oak log|cover]], the player will have to shoot at several more buttons, now evading or killing a set of skeletons. With each button pressed, an [[anvil]] will drop, making the situation easier. Once all three are activated, players can jump up a set of emerald blocks, leading to the end of the area on a higher area. Underneath a build of an [[apple]] is a reward chest, containing an eye of ender and an actual apple. Once the items are claimed, players can leave through a nearby cave, dropping down back to the entrance.

=== Blaze parkour ===
After walking through a miniature recreation of a fortress, the player stands before a massive statue of a [[blaze]], floating above a pool of lava. Platforming across [[Magma Block|magma blocks]] allows the player to climb onto the blaze's smoke, represented by [[black stained glass]]. From there many blocks must be climbed, alternating between the smoke and [[Blaze Rod|blaze rods]], before reaching the top of the head. At the top lies a trapped double chest, containing an eye of ender and totem of undying.

=== Zombie Invasion ===

Set inside of a village in the shadow of a zombie statue, players enter the area through a fenced gate containing chests of several items, such as [[iron armor]] and [[Trident|tridents]]. Inside the village are many established structures, such as a [[Beetroot Seeds|beetroot]] farm. In the temple, a [[Villager|cleric]] can be found behind a fence, while in a two floor building a [[Villager|fisherman]] is locked on the balcony. To the left of the arena is a series of houses on different levels, reachable with [[Cobblestone Stairs|cobblestone stairs]], with one building overflowing with [[netherrack]]. In the center of the village is a tree with a button to activate the minigame, marked by a dark oak sign and two [[Bell|bells]].

Once the minigame begins, the time will change to night, and a raid horn will blare. Many zombies will begin to appear, targeting any villagers spawning inside the town, with the expectation that any players present will defeat them. As more zombies continue to spawn, the horn sound will play again and again, until every zombie is defeated and the day returns. As a reward, a chest by the entrance will be revealed, containing [[Rotten Flesh|rotten flesh]], three [[Emerald|emeralds]], and an eye of ender.
=== Not So Colorful Sheep ===

=== Bizarre Bazaar ===
{{Incomplete section|Remaining minigame|type=}}
Before the minigame itself is a large marketplace, decorated with the colors of a [[Wandering Trader|wandering trader]], with several stalls staffed with villagers. Two fishermen run a red shop made up of barrels with a [[Blast Furnace|blast furnace]] in the middle of the region. To the left are an [[armorer]] with a blue jungle stall, and a third fisherman with an acacia stall with a cyan and yellow awning, decorated with [[Smithing Table|smithing tables]]. The largest stall is a full tent, colored red and yellow, with a fourth fisherman, [[grindstone]], and [[campfire]]. The titular Bizarre Bazaar takes the form of a giant [[Trader Llama|trader llama]], however beside and underneath it are more villagers, including a fifth fisherman, a [[Villager|librarian]], and an empty awning.

The proper minigame can begin by entering an iron door in the foot of the llama, which lead to a hay bale floored room lined with ladders. At the top is a locked iron door, and a series of pistons blocking a hall, which can be corrected by flipping the levers above them. Behind the pistons is another ladder blocked at the top, a pit of ice next to it. Dropping down into the pit leads to a slime floor, which can be used to enter a partly hidden room in the wall of the ice, with a set of [[Sea Lantern|sea lanterns]] illuminating levers. Pressing the first and third levers will activate a redstone lamp, the ladder now usable. 

From there the player can find what appears to be a couch, made of [[Wooden Trapdoor|acacia trapdoors]] and [[Red Nether Brick Stairs|red nether brick stairs]], surrounded by glass and complicated redstone contraptions. Beside the couch is a downward stairway blocked by blocks of emerald, and in front of it a button that powers a series of [[Redstone Dust|redstone wires]] leading up to a locked [[Redstone Repeater|repeater]]. Near the wire is a second lower area, with two [[Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate|heavy weighted pressure plates]], and the iron door at the front. Powering both will open the emerald gate, leading to a drop made of [[Honey Block|honey blocks]] into lava. Sticking to the honey will help the player into a chamber made of [[Smooth Sandstone|smooth sandstone]], with instructions to stick to the walls to find two levers, opening into the blue ice room. Returning to the glass chamber, the button can now be pressed, opening another passage.

The next floor is a maze of glass blocks.

=== Snow Golem Slide ===

=== Pig Race ===
Set inside of an [[old growth spruce taiga]], the attraction is marked by a large statue of a [[pig]]. Between [[huge mushrooms]] are four stables containing a pig, named Porkchop, Bacon, Franklin, and Greased Lightning. Before them is a double chest full of [[Carrot on a Stick|carrots on sticks]], which are to be used to drive the pigs through a race, which can begin by pressing a marked button, releasing a set of fences on [[Sticky Piston|sticky pistons]]. Immediately there is a minor fork, in the form of a cobblestone boulder, which leads into a cobblestone cave, with [[Mushroom Block|mushroom spores]] being pushed back and forth by pistons. Avoiding those lead to a set of vines, which lead to a replica of an old growth pine taiga illuminated by [[glowstone]].

From there, riders will have to traverse blue ice, making a turn to a series of slime block launchers, leading to another set of vines. At the top of the vines is a plateau filled with ferns, leading to a drop to slime blocks that can propel the player onto a mossy cobblestone cube. Using more vines, the racer can climb onto a giant brown mushroom, and then onto a patch of blue ice, before finally reaching the pig statue, climbing up several ladders to its back. Upon reaching the head, the players' pigs will despawn, leaving them to claim an eye of ender in a chest. In order to return to the bottom, the players must jump into a pool of water below, stylized after a pig head.

=== Panda Parkour ===

Stepping across a bridge made of [[jungle planks]], the player finds a collection of [[Green Carpet|green carpets]] on top of [[bamboo]], as well as string on top of bamboo. Platforming across the bamboo leads upward to the top of a statue in the shape of a [[panda]] eating bamboo, made out of [[concrete]] and [[wool]]. On the right paw is a chest containing an eye of ender, and underneath the panda's bamboo is a pond the player can drop into.

=== Bat Cave Dig ===

=== Creeper Maze ===
Located inside walls made of bedrock, the player must navigate a maze infested with creepers and reach a massive structure in their image. Although the player cannot break blocks, including the hedges, creepers can, with the only barricade being the aforementioned walls and a door made using fences. Upon reaching the exit, the player is blocked by another fence, with [[Creeper Head|creeper heads]] on the posts. The only way to cross them is to get a creeper to explode, before climbing up numerous vines past TNT blocks, until reaching the top of the creeper's head. In a chest can be found an eye of ender, flint and steel, and potions of slow falling, which are useful to escape the maze with a nearby roof of slime blocks.
