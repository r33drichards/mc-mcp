[[File:Realms Stories.png|380px|thumb|Main screen of Realms Stories]]
'''Realms Stories''' is a social hub for members of a [[Realms|Realm]].

== Usage ==
Realms Stories is available for all players that are member of a [[Realm]] in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', for both Realms Plus and Realms Core subscriptions. It can be accessed from the main screen of the Realm in the [[play]] screen, and from the Edit Realm screen for the owner of the Realm. It can also be accessed from the [[pause menu]] while playing on the Realm.

The main screen of Realms Stories has three tabs, and a button to open the Realms Stories settings in the top-right.

== Story Feed ==
In the Story Feed, all story posts from Realm members are shown on the right side of the screen, and a list of recently played members on the left side. A player can add with the purple button on the top-left. A story post can contain text, and/or a [[screenshot]] that is stored in-game.

Every story post in the Story Feed shows the player that added the story, and the time or date when the story was added. If the story contains a screenshot, the player can open it in full screen by clicking on it. Every post can also be liked with the button below, including a player's own posts. The amount of likes is shown on the left.

Players can also comment on every story post. These comments can only include text, but they can be liked by any player in the comments screen.

With the options button on the bottom-right of a post or comment, player's can remove their own posts, or report them to Xbox Enforcement. The Realm's owner can delete any story or comment, while other members can only delete their own. Other members can also notify the Realm's owner about a story. These reports can be accessed from the "Game Settings" tab in the Manage Realm screen for the owner.

=== Realm Events ===
These new stories are automatically posted to the feed when interesting events happen on a Realm. They can be toggled off in the Realms Stories settings by the owner.

== Timeline ==
[[File:Ore UI - Realms Stories Screen Menu "Timeline" Tab (Bedrock).png|thumb|The "Timeline" tab.]]
Realm Stories also contain a Timeline table that shows numerous activity of players in the Realm. The playing times are colored for each player. One week of playing times is shown on the screen, but older data can be viewed with the arrow buttons above. To gain access to the Timeline and store activity data, a player needs to opt in for the Timeline. Players can opt out at any time, and they can also opt in anytime later again. The Realm's owner can view all members that are opted out.

== Members ==
[[File:Ore UI - Realms Stories Screen Menu "Members" Tab (Bedrock).png|thumb|The "Members" tab.]]
Shows a list of all Realm members and their activity or online status. The list can be sorted and filtered, and there is a text box on the top-left to search for members. The Realm's owner can also access the "Members" settings tab in the Manage Realm screen from here.

== Realms Stories settings ==
[[File:Ore UI - Realms Stories Settings Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The Realms Stories settings.]]
