'''Markus 'Junkboy' Toivonen''' is the creative brand director for [[Mojang Studios]]. He is best known for designing the original version of the ''Minecraft'' logo.

He is quite secretive about his identity, and has only appeared on video as a blue-haired pixelated face.<ref>http://www.gametrailers.com/video/documentary-hd-minecraft/710788 (Junkboy can be seen at 9:04)</ref> In the [[Mojang Studios#Caller's Bane|Scrolls]] documentary, his face is blurred, but can be made out as bald.<ref>http://2playerproductions.com/news/current/293-scrolls (Junkboy can be seen at 1:39)</ref> Junkboy's name also appears in the Legacy Console and Bedrock editions as "No one at Mojang has ever seen Junkboy's face." while on the world loading screen.
