'''25w46a''' is the sixth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.11]], released on November 11, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w46a|id=a|November 11, 2025}}</ref>

A separate [[unobfuscated version]] of 25w46a was released, titled '''25w46a Unobfuscated''' (or '''25w46a_unobfuscated''' when in the launcher). This is an experimental version released in preparation for obfuscation being removed from {{JE}} clients and servers.<ref>{{Mcnet|removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition|Removing obfuscation in Java Edition|October 29, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]'''
* Added "One does not simply walk to the [[Far Lands]]".
** References [[kurtjmac]], who completed his 14-year Far Lands walk a month prior.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Decorated Pot]]s'''
* Now have the [[Particles (Java Edition)|particle]] texture of [[terracotta]] upon [[breaking]].{{source code ref|Before: <code>"particle": "entity/decorated_pot/decorated_pot_side"</code><br><br>After: <code>"particle": "minecraft:block/terracotta"</code>}}

=== Items ===
'''[[Netherite Horse Armor]]'''
* No longer burns in [[fire]] or [[lava]].
* Worn texture is now the same as {{in|be}}.

'''[[Spawn Egg]]s'''
* Are now sorted thematically in the [[Creative inventory]], according to the following categories:
** [[Overworld]]
*** Farm [[Animal]]s
*** [[Mounts]]
*** [[Pets]]
*** Wild Animals
*** [[Aquatic]]
*** Miscellaneous
*** [[Golems]]
*** [[Villagers]]
*** [[Undead]]
*** [[Spiders]]
*** [[Monsters]]
*** [[Illagers]]
** [[Nether]]
** [[The End]]

'''[[Spear]]s'''
* No longer cause item interact vibrations.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Horse]]''', '''[[Mule]]''', '''[[Donkey]]''', '''[[Camel]]''', '''[[Zombie Horse]]''' and '''[[Camel Husk]]'''
* Will not panic if controlled by mobs.

'''[[Nautilus]]''' and '''[[Zombie Nautilus]]''' 
* Now play a dash sound when they perform their dash attack.
* Added an inventory UI for both.

'''[[Parched]]'''
* Is now immune to the [[Weakness]] effect.

'''[[Zombified Piglin]]'''
* Zombified piglins spawned from lightning striking a [[pig]] now have a chance to hold a [[golden spear]].

=== General ===
'''[[Block model]]s'''
* Block model elements can now be rotated around multiple axes.
** Model is first rotated around X, then Y, then Z
** New fields:
*** {{cd|x}} &ndash; rotation around axis X in degrees, float, defaults to {{cd|0.0}}
*** {{cd|y}} &ndash; rotation around axis Y in degrees, float, defaults to {{cd|0.0}}
*** {{cd|z}} &ndash; rotation around axis Z in degrees, float, defaults to {{cd|0.0}}
** Existing fields {{cd|axis}} and {{cd|angle}} can still be used.
*** If both field sets are present, older notation takes presence.
* Existing restriction for angle value limiting them to {{cd|[-45, 45]}} has been removed.
** Note: Names of faces are not influenced by rotation. Features that depend on them, like culling, will always use original directions.

'''[[Blockstates definition]]'''
* Variants in blockstates definition files (defined in <samp>assets/minecraft/blockstates/</samp>) can now be also rotated around Z axis.
** New optional field {{cd|z}} has the same format as existing {{cd|x}} and {{cd|y}} fields: an integer with allowed values of {{cd|0}} (default), {{cd|90}}, {{cd|180}} and {{cd|270}}.
** Rotation around Z axis is applied after X and Y.

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* Added food properties to the following fish bucket items:
** {{cd|minecraft:cod_bucket}}
** {{cd|minecraft:salmon_bucket}}
** {{cd|minecraft:pufferfish_bucket}}
** {{cd|minecraft:tropical_fish_bucket}}

* {{cd|minecraft:use_effects}}
** Added field {{cd|interact_vibrations}}: boolean
*** Whether using this item emits {{cd|minecraft:item_interact_start}} and {{cd|minecraft:item_interact_finish}} game events.
*** Default value: {{cd|true}}

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|93.1}}.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Reverted removal of {{cd|contents}} as a supported value for the {{cd|minecraft:dynamic}} loot pool entry.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Renamed the "Show Music Toast" option to "Music Toast".
** Added a third state to the "Music Toast" option, allowing it to only be shown in the pause menu.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|74.0}}.
* Block model and state format has been expanded to allow more rotations.

'''Sound Events'''
* Added {{cd|entity.zombie_horse.eat}}.

'''[[Texture atlas]]'''
* To prepare for future work, the game will now print a warning if any defined sprites in any atlases share a name.

'''[[Textures]]'''
* Textures used for still water and lava are now hardcoded to {{cd|minecraft:block/water_still}} and {{cd|minecraft:block/lava_still}}.
* Beacons no longer support translucent textures.
* Added <samp>gui/container/nautilus</samp> used for the Nautilus inventory UI.
