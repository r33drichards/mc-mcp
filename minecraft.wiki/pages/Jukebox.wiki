A '''jukebox''' is a [[block]] used to insert and play [[music disc]]s. Playing a disc causes it to produce a [[redstone signal]] and allows nearby [[allay]]s to duplicate when given [[amethyst shard]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A jukebox can be broken using any [[tool]], but an [[axe]] is the fastest. Jukeboxes also drop all of their contents.

== Usage ==
=== Playback ===
{{control|Using}} a [[music disc]] on a jukebox inserts the disc and plays [[music]] or other audio corresponding to the type of music disc used. Pressing {{control|use}} on the jukebox again ejects the disc and stops any music playing. Music discs play only once before they must be ejected and reinserted. Note [[particles]] emit out the top when sound is playing. [[Audio]] being played by a jukebox can be heard from up to 64 blocks away.

[[Hopper]]s and [[dropper]]s and [[crafter]]s (via crafting [[disc fragment]]s into [[music disc 5]]) can be used to insert discs into a jukebox.

Tamed [[parrot]]s and [[allay]]s dance while in a 3 block radius from a jukebox that is playing a disc. 

==== Allay duplication ====
If an [[amethyst shard]] is used on an allay dancing next to a playing jukebox, the allay splits in two (itself and a new allay) and the amethyst shard is consumed. Both allays have a 5-minute cooldown before they can be duplicated again.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A jukebox can act as a redstone [[Redstone components#Power components|power source]]. A redstone signal of strength 15 is emitted while music from a disc is playing, powering any adjacent [[redstone wire]], [[redstone repeater]]s, and [[mechanism component]]s. The signal turns off when the music track ends or if the disc is removed before the track ends. Being a power source, a jukebox redirects adjacent redstone wires to point to itself.

A [[redstone comparator]] can read a jukebox to produce a signal that varies in strength based on which disc is inserted. The comparator emits power as long as the music disc is stored in the jukebox, even if it has stopped playing. The following table shows the redstone signal strength output for each disc.

==== Looping ====
Jukeboxes disable adjacent hoppers while a music disc is playing inside them, due to them emitting a redstone signal even without using a comparator. When the song ends, the hopper placed below the jukebox is re-enabled, so the disc is automatically pulled out and stored in the hopper. To pull out the disc before the song ends, a [[minecart with hopper]] can be used, since it is not affected by the jukebox's redstone impulse.

A system of hoppers and droppers can then be used to automatically re-insert the disc, causing it to loop. Multiple different discs can be inserted into a system to create music playlists.

If a hopper under the jukebox is powered by anything else, it does not eject the disc, allowing systems to be paused once the current disc stops playing.

=== Fuel ===
Jukeboxes can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Note blocks ===
Jukeboxes can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Jukeboxes cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed or pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

== Sounds ==
''Music discs are not included here.''

== Trivia ==
[[File:C418 skin.png|upright=0.4|thumb|C418's skin]]
* [[C418]] has a Steve skin with a jukebox for a head, as a visual gag alluding to his role as lead musician at the time.
* In real life, a {{W|phonograph|newtab=1}} can use a diamond-tipped stylus. Similarly, the jukebox uses a [[diamond]] as a crafting ingredient. It is unknown if this was a coincidence or a deliberate choice.
