'''14w28a''' is the thirty-fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on July 9, 2014.<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|486899774504054785|The 14w28a snapshot is now available|July 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113521/https://mojang.com/2014/07/minecraft-snapshot-14w28a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w28b|date=July 9, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|stats <entity&#124;block> ...}}'''
* Usage: 
** {{cmd|stats entity <selector> <mode>}}.
** {{cmd|stats block [x] [y] [z] <mode>}}.
** Alternative and more featureful way of interacting with <code>CommandStats</code>.
*** Updates a scoreboard objective based on the number of entities/blocks which has been affecting the command, it updates the objective for the entity that ran the command, fake players can be used when run in a command block.
*** After the <code>mode</code> there are currently 4 possible stats that can be updated: <code>SuccessCount</code>, <code>AffectedBlocks</code>, <code>AffectedEntities</code> and <code>AffectedItems</code>.
*** For example: {{cmd|stats entity @a set AffectedBlocks @a Test}} updates a scoreboard objective named 'Test' for all players whenever a command is performed relative to them, the objective updates by the number of blocks affected by the command since the stat was set to <code>AffectedBlocks</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Cake JE3 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Cake]]s'''
* Produce a signal for comparators to detect.
** Each slice is equivalent to 2 redstone signal strength, for a maximum of 14.

{{Animate|Powered Rail (Ew) JE1 BE1.png;Activator Rail (Ew) JE1 BE1.png;Detector Rail (Ew) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} '''Sloped [[Powered Rail|Powered Rails]], [[Activator Rail|Activator Rails]] and [[Detector Rail|Detector Rails]]'''
* No longer decrease their hitbox height to be 2 pixels high when activated.

=== Gameplay === 
'''[[Enchantment]]s & [[effect]]s'''
* Now accept named IDs as well as numerical IDs.

=== General ===
'''Block states'''
* Chunks now use block states instead of metadata.

'''Performance & rendering'''
* Improved performance with rendering.
* Many optimizations to both the server (including singleplayer) and the client.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Can now customize network compression in <code>server.properties</code>.

'''Video settings'''
* Added "Alternative Block" option to disable (or enable) weighted alternative block models.
** When turned off, the least complex highest priority model is always used for each block.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:The Killer Bunny JE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Rabbit]]'''
* The chance of a killer bunny spawning was reduced from 1/1000 to 1/2500.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* When breaking a container such as a [[chest]] or [[furnace]], the [[item entities]] are now dropped at the correct position.
