A '''wind wand''' is an item introduced in [[25w14craftmine]]. It uses the [[breeze rod]] texture with an [[enchantment glint]]. It has its other counterpart, the [[fire wand]].

== Obtaining ==
The wind wand is only obtainable without [[commands]] by getting the [[Player Unlocks|upgrade]] "Heart of the Oak", but by default this upgrade is obfuscated. Killing a [[breeze]] makes this upgrade readable.

== Usage ==
The wind wand shoots out a [[wind charge]] when used.
