|{{HistoryLine||1.2.1|dev=12w07a|Lit redstone lamps have an item form corresponding to its block ID. It can be obtained via inventory editors with numeric item ID 124.
|Interestingly, unlike most items of this type, lit redstone lamps are themselves dropped by lit redstone lamps.<ref>https://youtu.be/o74FHoM0Lo4?t=29s</ref>
|Pick Block on a lit redstone lamp block would highlight any existing lit redstone lamp blocks in the hotbar, rather than normal redstone lamps.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.2.4|dev=release|Lit redstone lamps now drop normal redstone lamp items when broken in most cases. They can still be obtained by breaking one with a Silk Touch enchanted tool.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.2.5|dev=pre|Pick Block on a lit redstone lamp now always returns a normal, unpowered redstone lamp.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w16a|Lit redstone lamp items can now be obtained in singleplayer worlds via the {{cmd|give}} command using the respective numeric ID.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w37a|The direct item form of lit redstone lamps has been removed from the game. It can no longer exist as an item in any way, only as a placed block.
|The ability for lit redstone lamps to drop lit redstone lamp items via Silk Touch has ''not'' been removed, however. As a result, attempting to obtain a lit redstone lamp this way in this version crashes the game with a [[wikipedia:Null pointer#Null dereferencing|NullPointerException]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w38a|Lit redstone lamp blocks now drop unlit items regardless of tool.<ref>{{bug|MC-3973}}</ref>{{verify|ticket says 13w38c - was it just resolved late?}}}}
|{{HistoryLine||?|Added <samp>BlockStateTag</samp>, which allows to obtain all valid block states of respective block. This tag allows to obtain many technical blocks otherwise cannot be obtained, including lit redstone lamp.}}
