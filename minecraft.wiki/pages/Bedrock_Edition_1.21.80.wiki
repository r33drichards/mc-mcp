'''[[Commands]]'''
*Released {{cmd|place structure}} and {{cmd|place jigsaw}} out of the Data-Driven Jigsaw Structures experiment.

'''Components'''
*The {{cd|minecraft:rideable}} component now has three new additional fields:
**{{cd|dismount_mode}} defines where riders are placed when dismounting the entity:
***{{cd|default}}, riders are placed on a valid ground position around the entity, or at the center of the entity's collision box if none is found.
***{{cd|on_top_center}}, riders are placed at the center of the top of the entity's collision box.
**{{cd|on_rider_enter_event}}, defines the event to execute on the owner entity when an entity starts riding it.
**{{cd|on_rider_exit_event}}, defines the event to execute on the owner entity when an entity stops riding it.
*Content errors will log missing texture references in the {{cd|minecraft:icon}} item component.
*The {{cd|minecraft:rideable}} component's {{cd|Seat}} definition now has two additional fields:
**{{cd|third_person_camera_radius}} can be used to set a different camera radius when in third person or third person front camera. The value needs to be in the range {{cd|[1.0, 64.0]}}. Value {{cd|0.0}} is ignored.
**{{cd|camera_relax_distance_smoothing}} adds springiness to the camera movement when the camera moves back to its radius after being pushed closer to the player by and obstacle. A higher value means a stiffer spring. The value needs to be in the range {{cd|[1.0, 32.0]}}. Value {{cd|0.0}} is ignored.
*The {{cd|minecraft:leashable}} component now support multiple presets:
**A list of presets can be defined in the new {{cd|presets}} field.
**Each preset determines how the entity behaves when leashed to another entity.
**A preset is selected when the entity is leashed and remains active until it is leashed to something else.
**The first preset whose {{cd|filter}} conditions are met will be applied.
**If no presets match, a default configuration is used instead.
**The following fields are now part of each preset:
***{{cd|filter}}: Defines the condition that selects this preset out of all the presets upon leashing.
***{{cd|soft_distance}}: Distance at which the spring effect begins.
***{{cd|hard_distance}}: Distance at which the leash stiffens.
***{{cd|max_distance}}: Distance at which the leash breaks.
***{{cd|can_be_stolen}}: Determines if a player can steal the leashed entity using a lead.
*Added validation for block asset references in components.
**Content errors will log missing block references for the following components:
***item component {{cd|minecraft:digger}}
***item component {{cd|minecraft:entity_placer}}
***item component {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}}
***spawn rules component {{cd|minecraft:spawns_on_block_filter}}
***spawn rules component {{cd|minecraft:spawns_on_block_prevented_filter}}
***spawn rules component {{cd|minecraft:spawns_above_block_filter}}
**{{cd|can_be_stolen}} has been moved from {{cd|presets}} back to being a direct sub-field of the {{cd|minecraft:leashable}} component.
*Introduced a {{cd|drop_item_y_offset}} parameter to the {{cd|minecraft:interact}} component.
**Defines a custom y-axis offset for when an item is dropped.
**Requires {{cd|drop_item_slot}} to be specified.
*The {{cd|minecraft:leashable}} component's {{cd|on_unleash}} trigger triggers on the leash breaking with format version {{cd|1.21.80}} and later.
**The old behavior is still available to opt in to by setting {{cd|on_unleash_interact_only}} to {{cd|true}}.
*Content errors will log missing entity references in the {{cd|minecraft:entity_placer}} and {{cd|minecraft:projectile}} item components.

'''Documentation'''
*Include {{cd|biome}} and {{cd|client_biome}} JSON files in generated documentation.

'''Entity Filters'''
*Added new entity filter {{cd|has_equipment_tag}}, works like {{cd|has_equipment}} but takes an item tag instead of an item name.

'''General'''
*Updated the client side biome component {{cd|minecraft:water_appearance}} field {{cd|surface_color}} to be optional. Added a content error that fires if the component is empty.

'''Goals'''
*{{cd|minecraft:behavior.float_wander}} has been updated with new fields:
**{{cd|navigate_around_surface}}: enables the usage of a new algorithm to find random positions to navigate to. The new algorithm aims to find random positions in the vicinity of solid (i.e. non-air and non-liquid) blocks, and if that fails will fall back to finding a random position in the vicinity of the current dimension's surface level.
**{{cd|additional_collision_buffer}}: makes sure there are no blocks present in an inflated area around the target position.
**{{cd|allow_navigating_through_liquids}}: allow the mob to have target positions inside liquids.
**{{cd|surface_xz_dist}}: the distance in the horizontal directions to look for nearby surfaces. Only valid when {{cd|navigate_around_surface}} is {{cd|true}}.
**{{cd|surface_y_dist}}: the distance in the vertical directions to look for nearby surfaces. Only valid when {{cd|navigate_around_surface}} is {{cd|true}}.
*{{cd|minecraft:behavior.follow_mob}} has been updated with the following new fields:
**{{cd|use_home_position_restriction}}: If {{cd|true}}, the mob will respect the {{cd|minecraft:home}} component's {{cd|restriction_radius}} field when choosing a target to follow. If {{cd|false}}, it will choose target position without considering home restrictions.
**{{cd|preferred_actor_type}}: The type of actor to prefer following. If left unspecified, a random actor among those in range will be chosen.
**{{cd|filters}}: If non-empty, provides criteria for filtering which nearby Mobs can be followed. If empty default criteria will be used, which will exclude players, squid variants, Fish variants, tadpoles, dolphins, and mobs of the same type as the owner of the goal.
*Added fields to {{cd|minecraft:behavior.tempt}} goal:
**The {{cd|stop_distance}} field specifies a custom distance for when the tempted mob should stop moving towards the player.
**The {{cd|on_start}} field specifies the event to trigger when the goal starts.
**The {{cd|on_end}} field specifies the event to trigger when the goal ends.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:behavior.float_tempt}} goal, which allows a tempted mob to move in a line towards the player:
**This goal is a variant of the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.tempt}} goal and shares the same fields
**Requires the mob to be in a floating state (e.g. use the {{cd|minecraft:navigation.float}} component)

'''Graphical'''
*Added support for multiple locators for use with leashes for rendering multiple ropes between two entities.
*{{cd|multi_lead_n}}:
**Where {{cd|n {{=}} {1, 2, 3, 4<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} defines locators when the entity is leashed to a different entity.
**Used if and only if it has a corresponding {{cd|multi_lead_hold_n}} and the number n is equal on the two entites.
*{{cd|multi_lead_hold_n}}
**Where {{cd|n {{=}} {1, 2, 3, 4<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} defines locators where the entity is leashing a different entity.
**Used if and only if it has a corresponding {{cd|multi_lead_n}} and the number n is equal on the two entites.
*{{cd|lead}}
**is set to origin if it is not defined in the geo.
*{{cd|lead_hold}}
**is set to origin if it is not defined in the geo.

'''Items'''
*Bundles' open icons are now specified via {{cd|IconItemComponent}}. This addresses the issue where a missing texture would appear for an opened custom Bundle. Bundle icon paths have also now be separated into unique keys in {{cd|item_texture.json}}.

'''[[Molang]]'''
*{{cd|query.graphics_mode_is_any}} no longer requires the Upcoming Creator Features experiment.
*Added the {{cd|query.leashed_entity_count}} Molang query, which allows querying how many entities have the given entity as their leash holder.
*Added {{cd|query.has_any_leashed_entity_of_type}} which takes a list of entity identities and checks if the actor has any of the listed entities leashed. Available on both the client and the server.
**Usage: {{cd|query.has_any_leashed_entity_of_type( 'minecraft:sheep', 'minecraft:creeper' )}}

'''Network Protocol'''
*Added {{cd|ActorFlags::DOES_SERVER_AUTH_ONLY_DISMOUNT}}.

'''Stability and performance'''
*Make friends drawer and play screen more performant using a cached view.

'''[[Structure]]s'''
*Exposed new fields to data driven jigsaw structures: {{cd|start_height}}, {{cd|dimensional_padding}}, {{cd|pool_aliases}}, {{cd|max_distance_from_center}}
*Made {{cd|height_map_projection}} optional and changed {{cd|anchor}} to {{cd|start_jigsaw_name}}

** Can be fed snowballs to speed up their growth.
** Can be summoned using the command: {{cmd|/summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_baby}}.

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Game rule]]s'''
* Added the game rule command {{cd|locatorBar}} to enable or disable the [[locator bar]] feature.

'''[[Player Locator Bar]]'''
*The Player Locator Bar (or Locator Bar) is a new UI element on the player HUD that displays the direction of other players in the world.
**When the player locator bar experiment is enabled and there are multiple players in a world, the player locator bar will appear on-screen for each player, replacing the experience bar. The player level number will still be visible as before above the player locator bar.
**The Player Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards another player. If another player is 30 degrees above or below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up or down arrow will be displayed.
**Crouching will hide the player, preventing their indicator from appearing on the player locator bar of other players.
**Players in spectator mode are visible only to players in spectator mode.
**A mob head or a carved pumpkin will similarly hide players from the player locator bar when worn in the head slot.
*Using a potion of invisibility will also hide players from the player locator bar.

==== Graphical ====
'''[[Vibrant Visuals]]'''
[[File:Vibrant Visuals menu (Bedrock Preview 1.21.80.25).png|thumb|Vibrant Visuals settings]]
* The [[Deferred Technical Preview]] is now available outside of ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'' using the Vibrant Visuals experiment.
* New vanilla PBR textures and deferred lighting configurations have been added.
* It is customizable and has two different built-in forms: Favor Performance, and Favor Visuals. Specific feature and visual settings can also be adjusted by expanding "Vibrant Visuals Options".

==== Technical ====
'''API'''
:{{cd|@minecraft/server 2.0.0-beta}}
*{{cd|EntitySkinIdComponent}} has been changed to read-only in version {{cd|2.0 beta}}
*Added property {{cd|localizationKey}} to {{cd|Entity}}, {{cd|Block}}, and {{cd|ItemStack}} which returns the key used for finding the localized names of these objects.
:Added new Container APIs:
*{{cd|contains(ItemStack)}}: Attempts to find an instance of an item inside the container.
*{{cd|firstEmptySlot()}}: Finds the index of the first empty slot inside the container.
*{{cd|irstItem()}}: Finds the index of the first item inside the container.
*{{cd|find(ItemStack)}}: Find the index of the first instance of an item inside the container.
*{{cd|reverseFind(ItemStack)}}: Find the index of the last instance of an item inside the container.
*Added {{cd|CustomCommandOrigin}} to custom command script callback.
*Added {{cd|CustomCommandSource}} enum.
*Renamed {{cd|CustomCommandPermissionLevel}} to {{cd|CommandPermissionLevel}}.
*Renamed {{cd|CustomCommandParamType.Position}} to {{cd|CustomCommandParamType.Location}}.
*{{cd|BlockCustomComponent}} now take an optional {{cd|CustomComponentParameters}} object for Custom Components V2 experiment as a second argument to event callbacks in {{cd|2.0.0-beta}}.
*{{cd|CustomComponentParameters}} added to {{cd|2.0.0-beta}}.
**params property added to {{cd|CustomComponentparameters}} to {{cd|2.0.0-beta}}.
*{{cd|ItemCustomComponent}} now take an optional {{cd|CustomComponentParameters}} object for Custom Components V2 experiment as a second argument to event callbacks in {{cd|2.0.0-beta}}.
*{{cd|EntityFrictionModifierComponent}} has been changed to read-only in version {{cd|2.0.0-beta}}.

:{{cd|@mincraft/server-admin}}
*Added {{cd|AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEvent}}
**Added {{cd|beforeEvents.asyncPlayerJoin}}, {{cd|AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEvent}}, and {{cd|AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEventSignal}} to allow creators to delay players joining the world.
**{{cd|AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEventSignal.subscribe}} is different than other events because the callback it accepts returns a promise. Once the promise is resolved, the player will join the world, or if the promise is rejected the player will be disconnected without joining the server. The player will be at the loading screen while the promise is pending.

:Custom Commands
*Added support for custom commands authored in script. The new {{cd|CustomCommandRegistry}} is provided when listening to {{cd|ModuleStartupEvent}}. 
**Additional types added:
***{{cd|CustomCommandRegistry}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandPermissionLevel}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandParamType}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandResult}} and {{cd|CustomCommandStatus}}
***{{cd|CustomCommandParameter}}

'''Blocks'''
*When Custom Components V2 experiment is enabled, {{cd|minecraft:custom_components}} component is deprecated in {{cd|1.21.80}} and higher format versions.
*When Custom Components V2 experiment is enabled, custom components are flattened inline with other components and allow parameters in {{cd|1.21.80}} and higher format versions. Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"components": {
    "example_namespace:example_component": {
        "someParam": 3,
        "anotherParam": "test"
    }
}</syntaxhighlight>
*New field {{cd|condition}} added to the culling rules schema. It provides more control over which neighbor blocks will trigger a face or part to be culled.
**The supported values are {{cd|default}}, {{cd|same_culling_layer}}, {{cd|same_block}} and {{cd|same_block_permutation}}.
***{{cd|default}} will pass the condition if the neighbor block is full and opaque.
****All conditions are an extension of {{cd|default}}, meaning a full and opaque neighbor will always be a passing condition, before the extended {{cd|same_*}} condition is checked.
***{{cd|same_culling_layer}} will pass the condition if the neighbor block shares the same {{cd|culling_layer}} as the block being occluded, defined in the geometry component.
****If either of the culling layers being compared is {{cd|minecraft:culling_layer.undefined}}, the condition will never pass.
***{{cd|same_block}} will pass the condition if the neighbor block has the same identifier.
***{{cd|same_block_permutation}} will pass the condition if the neighbor block has the same identifier and is the exact same permutation.
**Additionally, the feature is currently only usable behind the "upcoming creator features" toggle.
*New field {{cd|culling_layer}} added to the block's geometry component. It allows different blocks to be grouped together when using the {{cd|same_culling_layer}} condition in a culling rules file.
**When using the {{cd|minecraft}} namespace, the only allowed culling layer identifiers are: {{cd|minecraft:culling_layer.undefined}} or {{cd|minecraft:culling_layer.leaves}}.
**Additionally, the feature is currently only usable behind the "upcoming creator features" toggle.

'''Cameras'''
*Changed approach for the easing between moving targets under the Experimental Creator Camera Features toggle.

'''Experiments'''
*Added Drop 2 2025 experiment.
*Added Custom Components V2 experiment.
*Added Vibrant Visuals experiment.

'''[[Gameplay]]'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:replace_biomes}} component to allow for custom biomes to replace portions of vanilla biomes. To use, add to custom biome files in behavior packs.

'''Graphical'''
*Added a new lighting model for clouds in the Deferred Technical Preview, now called [[Vibrant Visuals]]. The lighting parameters can not be configured at this time.
*Increased the range of cloud rendering in the Deferred Technical Preview.
*Added pixelated reflections to the Deferred Technical Preview. This new effect will cause reflections to align to the texel grid of textures in the world.
*Added pixelated shadows to the Deferred Technical Preview. This new effect can be controlled with the new shadows JSON schema, {{cd|shadows/global.json}}. This file adds new settings that control the style of shadows in the game. Available parameters are {{cd|shadow_stlye}}, which can be {{cd|soft_shadows}} or {{cd|blocky_shadows}}, and {{cd|texel_size}}. {{cd|soft_shadows}} are the default style, while {{cd|blocky_shadows}} results in shadows that are pixelated in appearance. When {{cd|blocky_shadows}} are enabled, {{cd|texel_size}} controls the size of the pixelation effect. {{cd|texel_size}} should be equivalent to the block texture size in order to achieve a one to one mapping between the pixels in a texture and the pixelated effect created by enabling {{cd|blocky_shadows}}, but this is not required. An example version of what {{cd|shadows/global.json}} could look like is as follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
{
  "format_version": "1.21.80",
  "minecraft:shadow_settings": {
   "shadow_style": "blocky_shadows",

'''Blocks'''
*Always add a missing {{cd|Destruction Particles}} component to {{cd|blocks}} that have a {{cd|Material Instances}} component, using the {{cd|down}} material as reference:
**The {{cd|texture}} field in {{cd|minecraft:destruction_particles}} is now optional; if not provided or empty, it will be populated from the {{cd|Material Instances}} component.

'''Graphical'''
*Updated the format of {{cd|lighting/global.json}} to include support for controlling the new End light flash in [[Vibrant Visuals]]. The {{cd|directional_lights}} section now has two groups: {{cd|orbital}}, which contains the lighting information around the sun and moon, and {{cd|flash}}, which contains information about the [[End]] light flash. The {{cd|flash}} section supports an {{cd|illuminance}} field which controls the max illuminance of the End light flash, and a {{cd|color}} field, which controls the color of the flash. Example JSON with this new format follows:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
{
  "format_version": "1.21.80",
  "minecraft:lighting_settings": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "minecraft:default_lighting"
    },
    "directional_lights": {
      "orbital": {
        "sun": {
          "illuminance": {

          },
          "color": {
            "0.0": [ 255, 255, 0 ]
          }
        },
        "moon": {
          "illuminance": {
            "0.0": 1.0,
          },
          "color": {
            "0.0": [ 0, 0, 255 ]
          }
        },
        "orbital_offset_degrees": 5.0
      },
      "flash": {
        "illuminance": 1.0,
        "color": [ 255, 0, 255 ]

'''Other'''
*Fixed a bug that occasionally caused an error when creating a Realm on an empty slot.
*Fixed a crash that could sometimes occur when certain foliage textures fail to load.
*Fixed "Download all missing packs" button not working under specific conditions.
*Fixed an issue with {{cd|BlockPermutation::withState}} in outdated scripts that prevented some states from being set correctly on a number of blocks. Affected blocks include any which have had their directional or placement states recently changed. Scripts created after these blocks were changed may need to be updated to avoid unintended behavior.
*Fixed rotation of Jigsaw sections when Data-Driven Jigsaw Structures is enabled.
*Fixed a bug where the last byte was sometimes lost when reading encrypted files on Xbox, which caused some files to become invalid and fail to load.
*Fixed mirroring of door blocks when part of a structure that is being placed.
*Fixed ambient occlusion issue for non 1x1x1 blocks. When a block around any of these smaller non 1x1x1 blocks is broken, the AO computation is correctly applied to the face in the direction of that broken block. Previously the wrong face could be seen getting lightened/darkened. A list of blocks affected: stairs, walls, gates, buttons, cakes, plates, fences, anvil, grindstone, hopper, bell, lectern, eggs, brewing stand.
*Worlds are no longer missing from the storage menu.
*Bundle tooltip no longer sometimes renders as if having a different amount of items.
*Block using the {{cd|minecraft:destruction_particles}} component will now correctly be sent to player connecting to a host.
*Fixed an issue where Text To Speech wasn't working on Android Fire Tablet devices.
*Fixed an issue where the player would momentarily lay under or beside a Bed when going to sleep.
*Fixed a crash when clicking several times while trying to upload a world to an inactive Realm slot.
*Fixed an issue that caused a crash while generating chunks.

*Fixed a bug that a player can sprint in water faster than swimming.
*Fixed a bug where incorrect Json errors would appear for valid item texture references.
*Stained glass now renders with correct colors when using Vibrant Visuals.
