The '''narrator'''{{only|java|short=1}} or '''text to speech'''{{only|bedrock|short=1}} is a text-to-speech engine that automatically reads chat messages and other text elements in the user interface, such as titles and selected buttons.

== Usage ==
It can be toggled on in the accessibility settings or by pressing {{key|Ctrl + B}} (or {{key|Cmd + B}} on Mac). The narrator can be toggled between the following settings:

*'''Off''': The narrator is inactive.
*'''All''': The narrator reads chat and system messages.
*'''Chat''': The narrator reads only messages produced by players.
*'''System''': The narrator reads only messages produced by the system (UI text, command outputs, notifications, etc.).

The keyboard shortcut for toggling the narrator can be disabled in the accessibility settings.

The language of the narrator is defined in host system and cannot be changed from within the game (although it can be forced in Windows by editing the Windows Registry).<ref>{{bug|MC-118526||Can't change language of narrator; uses system language instead of game language|WAI}}</ref>
