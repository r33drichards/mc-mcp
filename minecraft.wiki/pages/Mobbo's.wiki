'''Mobbo's''' is an apparent restaurant owned and themed after [[Mobbo]]; in truth, a front to capture their enemies.

== Layout ==
On the outside, the building resembles a hastily made pastiche of Mobbo's head, made out of [[wool]]. In the middle of their mouth is a single [[Wooden Door|oak door]], while above their eyes is a neon sign, labeling the establishment "a real restaurant." The roof is a simple [[Wooden Stairs|oak stairs]] arrangement, with a pink M made of [[Wool|pink wool]] on top.

The interior of the building is even more cheaply constructed, being a shapeless mass of cobblestone with no lighting. When the building appears at night, however, several [[Torch|torches]] appear surrounding it. To the right side of the building is a long [[Rail|railway]], and from that angle it can be seen that the roof is more of a trapazoidal sign on the front.

Later, upon entering [[Mobboland]], a second Mobbo's is established to exist. Although visually identical on the outside, it's never made clear if it has any practical differences.

== Biography ==
During a conflict wherein [[Jonathan Minecraft]] sought to take over ''[[Minecraft]]'', [[M.A.R.I.L.L.A.]] and [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]] attempted to investigate, inserting themselves into the game. Upon arriving, they began to search for Mobbo, and assumed after a while that they had already been defeated. To celebrate, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. pointed towards a newly opened restaurant, Mobbo's. Unbeknownst to them, it was a trap made specifically for them.

Approximately three seconds upon entering, the duo were overwhelmed by mobs of [[skeletons]] and [[zombies]], unprotected by the darkness inside M.A.R.I.L.L.A. Fearing for their lives, the two began to bicker and mock each other. However, it turned out that Mobbo had actually hired a [[villager]] to work inside, and was gullible enough to ask for orders. Thinking fast, Narrator managed to convince them to provide an escape, in the form of a [[minecart]].
