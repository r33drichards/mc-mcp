'''1.19 Pre-release 3''' (known as '''1.19-pre3''' in the launcher) is the third pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on May 25, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-19-pre-release-2|Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 3|May 25, 2022}}</ref> which makes tweaks, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Sculk sensor]]'''
* {{cd|item_interact_start}} is no longer detectable as a vibration, to allow more specific actions be detected, like {{cd|drink}} or {{cd|eat}}.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Warden]]'''
* Wardens' sonic boom attack now bypasses the damage reduction by armor enchantments such as [[Protection]].

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Item frame]]'''
* Reverted the change made in [[22w15a]], which made a larger hitbox size when put a map inside it.

=== General ===
'''[[Tags]]'''
* Removed {{cd|moss_carpet}} from the {{cd|#frogs_spawnable_on}} block tag.
* Removed {{cd|item_interact_start}} from the {{cd|d=and|#vibrations|#warden_can_listen}} game event tag.
