The first released [[pre-Classic]] version was made on May 13, 2009, at 20:11 UTC.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20140911065540/https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/rd-132211/rd-132211.json rd-132211.json]</ref> It is the oldest version available in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' and the current oldest archived version of ''Minecraft''. This is the first version released in 2009.

The copy in the launcher was last modified on August 6, 2013, making it technically not original.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Placing and destroying [[block]]s. 
** Left-clicking places a block. Right-clicking destroys a block.
** Blocks cannot be placed past the existing border.
** Players can place blocks on the space they are occupying.
** Added a flashing white overlay that displays on the side of a block that the player has their mouse over.
* Holding down {{key|R}} causes the player to respawn in a random X and Z coordinate at Y=74 every frame until it is released.
** If the player falls into the void, they fall infinitely unless they press {{key|R}}.
* The level can be saved by pressing {{Keys|Enter}} or leaving the game.

== Changes ==
=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Level generation improved to be not so messy and random, as shown in the ''[[Cave game tech test]]'' video, but instead completely flat, which was similar to a [[superflat]] world.
* The build limit is Y=64.
* Blocks generate from Y=0 to Y=43, below Y=0 is essentially the void.
* Visually, Y=43 are always [[grass block]]s, with all other blocks being [[stone]].

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Caves no longer generate.

== Bugs ==
''' 2 bugs reported'''
* [[Block]]s can be placed inside the space the [[player]] is currently inside.<ref>TigIRC logs: "''(14:10:09) Zaratustra: I can spawn blocks where I currently exist''" [...] "''(14:10:32) notch: yeah, it's one of those bugs.. I keep ignoring it''" (18:10 UTC)</ref> This bug remained to the game until [[Classic 0.0.9a]].
* Some players experience extreme levels of lag when touching the ground after booting the game up, making the game unplayable.<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/java-edition-support/3050629-resolved-minecraft-pre-classic-versions-are</ref> A tutorial on how to fix this can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1pni7p9/tutorial_how_to_eliminate_lag_when_touching_the/]

== Trivia ==
* The "rd" before the version number '''old_alpha rd-132211''' stands for ''[[RubyDung]]'', a game Notch was working on before ''Minecraft'', whose codebase was later reused for ''Minecraft''.
* Level data is saved in a single {{cd|level.dat}} file inside the launcher folder, unlike future versions that have dedicated folders.
* While the intended level size is 256x64x256, a world of any size can be loaded. Worlds that are too small will have generation put ontop of them, and worlds that are too large will fill the entire world and then get cut off.
* Grass blocks are stored using the same block ID as stone, the difference between them is purely visual.
* Despite normally only using 2 block IDs (0 and 1), 0-255 are all possible IDs. Invalid IDs appear as air, but do not get converted into it.
* Because of all of the above, theoretically any [[w:gzip|gzipped file]] called {{cd|level.dat}} can be loaded as a world without issue, including a [[Java_Edition_level_format#level.dat_format|modern level.dat]]. Note this will likely corrupt the file upon saving. This is due to the extra generation when the world is undersized, or the trimming applied when it's oversized, or simply any blocks placed/broken.
