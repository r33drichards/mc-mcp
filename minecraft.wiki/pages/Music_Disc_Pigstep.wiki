The title "Pigstep" is a {{w|portmanteau}} of "piglin" and "dubstep".<ref>{{tweet|kuraine|1277309336532840448|I don't have any cool insight on the title, it's just dubstep for piglins.|June 26, 2020|archive=1}}</ref>

The song is an intense, somewhat hip-hop-style beat beginning with a repeating cello-like tune and dubstep-style drop, along with more mellow parts reminiscent of a radio. The song was featured in the 2025 production ''A Minecraft Movie''.

The album release of "Pigstep" includes two versions: the mono mix used in the game and a stereo mix with more usage of multi-directional sound.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "Pigstep" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "Pigstep", it emits a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 13.
