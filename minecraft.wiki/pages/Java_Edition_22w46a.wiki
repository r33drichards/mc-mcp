'''22w46a''' is the fifth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.3]], released on November 16, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w46a|November 16, 2022}}</ref> which adds [[piglin head]]s and the unique interactions between [[note block]]s and heads in the built-in experimental data pack, {{cmd|fillbiome}} command and new telemetry data screen, changes the telemetry and the mechanism of texture loading, and fixes bugs. This is the final snapshot released in 2022.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|fillbiome}}'''
* A new command to change biome entries for an area.
** Because biomes are not stored per-block, affected positions may not match input precisely.
* Syntax: {{cmd|link=none|fillbiome [<from>] [<to>] [<biome>]}}
** <code>from</code>: One corner of the area to fill.
** <code>to</code>: The other corner of the area to fill.
** <code>biome</code>: The biome to set.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added telemetry data collection screen.
** Displays information about the type of data that is sent.
** The level of data sent can be controlled between "Minimal" and "All".
*** "Minimal" sends only the required data.
*** "All" sends the required data, as well as optional data.
** The default data level is "Minimal".

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>#all_signs</code> block tag, contains <code>#signs</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Endermen]]'''
* Now only spawn at light level 7 and below in [[the Nether]], instead of 11 and below, to nerf certain portal-based mob farms.
* Blocks carried by endermen now use loot tables to generate drops when killed.
** This is done by simulating the block being mined using a [[Silk Touch]] diamond axe.

'''[[Skeleton]]s and [[wither skeleton]]s'''
* Now only spawn at light level 7 and below in [[the Nether]], instead of 11 and below, to nerf certain portal-based mob farms.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]'''
* Changed the description of the "Glow and Behold!" advancement.

'''Creative inventory'''
* Reordered "Redstone" tab.
* Added [[rail]]s to the "Tools & Utilities" tab next to [[minecart]]s.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* Can now be conditional on biomes.
* Syntax: {{cmd|link=none|execute if{{!}}unless biome [<pos>] [<biome>]}}

=== General ===
'''Logging'''
* Every telemetry event sent from the client is now logged to disk.
** Old log files are removed after 7 days.
** These can be found under the <samp>logs/telemetry</samp> directory.
*** A shortcut to this directory is available via the "Open My Data" button on the telemetry data collection screen.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* To improve loading performance, block and item textures are now loaded before they are processed by block and item models.
** By default, textures not in the <samp>textures/item</samp> and <samp>textures/block</samp> directories will no longer be automatically recognized and will fail to load.
* Can have configuration files now, located in the new <samp>atlases</samp> directory, that control which images are included in the atlases. That directory contains following JSON entries for configuring atlases:
** <code>blocks</code>: textures used by block and item models.
** <code>banner_patterns</code>, <code>beds</code>, <code>chests</code>, <code>shield_patterns</code>, <code>shulker_boxes</code>, <code>signs</code>: used to render some special-case models.
** <code>mob_effects</code>: textures used for effect icons in the UI.
** <code>paintings</code>: textures used for paintings.
** <code>particles</code>: textures used for particles (referenced by the <code>textures</code> field in files within the <samp>particles</samp> directory).
* If multiple packs include those files, they are merged by their order within the pack (same as tags in data packs).
* Inside these files is a JSON object with a single list called <code>sources</code>.
** Every entry in <code>sources</code> runs in during load, in order of definition, adding or removing new files to the texture list; to be later referenced by block models, particles, etc.
* Types of sources:
** <code>directory</code>: lists all files in a directory and its subdirectories, across all namespaces.
*** <code>source</code>: directory in pack to be listed (relative to <samp>textures</samp> directory)
*** <code>prefix</code>: string to be appended to the sprite name when loaded.
** <code>single</code>: adds a single file.
*** <code>resource</code>: location of a resource within the pack (relative to <samp>textures</samp> directory, implied <code>.png</code> extension).
*** <code>sprite</code>: sprite name (optional, defaults to <code>resource</code>).
** <code>filter</code>: removes sprites matching the given pattern.
*** <code>namespace</code>, <code>path</code>: patterns (regular expressions, regex) of ids to be removed (only works for entries already in the list), if omitted, any value will be matched.
** <code>unstitch</code>: copies rectangular regions from other images.
*** <code>resource</code>: location of a resource within the pack (relative to <samp>textures</samp> directory, implied <code>.png</code> extension)
*** <code>divisor_x</code>, <code>divisor_y</code>: used for determining the units used by regions.
*** <code>regions</code>: list of regions to copy from the source image.
**** <code>sprite</code>: sprite name.
**** <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>: coordinates of the top-left corner of the region.
**** <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>: size of the region.
*** Values such as <code>x</code> are transformed to real image coordinates via dividing by their divisor, and then multiplying by the real image size.
* Example:
** If a pack has a file named <samp>assets/test/textures/fancy/iridium.png</samp> and source is <code>{"type": "directory", "source": "fancy", "prefix": "custom/"}</code>, the texture will be available in models as <code>test:custom/iridium</code>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed <code>#stripped_logs</code> block and item tags.

'''Telemetry'''
* Added <code>WorldUnloaded</code> event, and removed client Java version from the <code>WorldLoaded</code> event.
** They are required events.
** Data includes game mode, client or server modded status and game version.
** Can be used to calculate how long the world session has lasted (in seconds and ticks).
** Data from <code>WorldLoaded</code> is sent when a world is launched, and data from <code>WorldUnloaded</code> is sent when a world is shut down (quitting to title, disconnecting from a server).
* Added 2 new optional events:
** <code>PerformanceMetrics</code>
*** Data includes frame rates, rendering performance, memory usage, operating system, and the modded status of the client and server.
*** With game version, it can be used to compare the performance profile for new versions of Minecraft.
** <code>WorldLoadTimes</code>
*** Data includes the total time in milliseconds for the world to load, whether this was a new world, as well as game version and platform details.
*** Can indicates what impacts load times when added new features or do larger technical changes.

'''General'''
* Translation files and <samp>pack.mcmeta</samp> are now including non-ASCII characters (encoded as UTF-8) directly instead of using escape sequences.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes only take effect when the 1.20 experimental data pack is enabled.

=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Piglin Head JE1.png|32px]] [[Piglin head]]'''
* [[Piglin]]s now drop their heads when killed by a charged [[creeper]].
* The piglin head flaps its ears when powered by redstone, or when worn by a player while walking.

==== General ====
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>#all_hanging_signs</code> to the new <code>#all_signs</code> block tag, as the additional part when built-in data pack enabled.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Block of bamboo]] and [[block of stripped bamboo]]'''
* Changed their top textures.

'''[[Bamboo planks]]'''
* Changed its texture by rotate 90 degress counterclockwise to match the same tiling pattern as other plank variants.
** Due to this change, the textures of [[bamboo button]], [[bamboo pressure plate]], [[bamboo slab]] and [[bamboo stairs]] are also changed.

'''[[Chiseled bookshelf]]'''
* Books in chiseled bookshelves can be added or removed from any slot by targeting the specific slot.

'''[[Note block]]'''
* When placing a mob [[head]] on a note block, that note block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by [[redstone]].

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Advancement]]'''
* [[Camel]]s are now required for the "Two by Two" advancement.
* "Glow and Behold!" advancement can be obtained by using a [[glow ink sac]] on a [[hanging sign]] now.
** The description now says "Make the text of any sign glow".
