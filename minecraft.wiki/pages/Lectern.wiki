A '''lectern''' is a [[block]] used to display a [[book and quill]] or [[written book]] for reading. Turning a page triggers a [[redstone]] pulse. It also serves as a [[librarian]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Lecterns can be broken with any [[tool]], but an [[axe]] is the fastest. Lecterns drop themselves and the book they are holding.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Lectern|axe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Empty lecterns can generate naturally in [[village]] libraries, up to two for some library variants.

One lectern generates as part of each [[ancient city]], in the secret room at the city center.

=== Crafting ===

|Output=Lectern

== Usage ==
Lecterns are the job site block of [[Trading#Librarian|librarian villagers]].

Librarian villagers do not place books into lecterns. They only stare at the lectern from less than a block away as "working".

=== Holding books ===
[[File:Lectern GUI.png|thumb|right|The UI when reading a book on a lectern.]]

Lecterns can also hold a single [[book and quill]] or [[written book]] that other players can read at the same time. Right-clicking an empty lectern  with a book and quill or written book places it. Right-clicking a lectern that already has a book opens an interface to read the book. Books occupying a lectern can be retrieved through the interface,{{Only|java}} by punching the lectern,{{Only|bedrock}} or by destroying the lectern, even when [[game rule]] <code>doTileDrops</code> is false.

Lecterns cannot hold [[enchanted book]]s or normal [[book]]s. Instead, right-clicking the lectern with an enchanted book or a normal book does nothing and the book won't be placed.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a lectern has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager (excluding nitwits) has a chance to change its profession to librarian and claim the lectern as its [[job site block]].

=== Redstone signal ===
Lecterns holding a book emit a full-strength [[redstone]] pulse that is one game [[tick]] long (0.5 redstone ticks) when a page is turned. A [[redstone comparator]] also records [[book]] reading and sends a signal, depending on what page the player is currently on. Because {{el|be}} displays two pages of the book at once, the same signal strength increments require double the number of pages.

{{IN|Java}}, a book with only 1 page gives maximum signal strength, however page 1 always gives 1 signal strength if the book contains at least 2 pages.

To calculate the signal strength <math>S</math> of a book with more than 1 page, use the following formula: 

<math>S = \left\lfloor 1 + \frac{14(P-1)}{M-1} \right\rfloor</math>

Where <math>\lfloor \, \rfloor</math> is the "floor" operation (round down), <math>M</math> is the maximum number of pages the book on the lectern has, and <math>P</math> is the current page number the lectern is turned to.

This is most noticeable when a book has 2 pages where the signal strength is either 1 on page 1 or 15 on page 2.

A book that would step up or down in increments of 1 per page would be 15 pages long.

The following Python program prints all possible pairs of two values to achieve a certain signal strength, with the first being the page number to be on and the second being the total number of pages.
<syntaxhighlight lang="python" line="1" start="1">
import math

S = int(input('Enter the target signal strength: '))  # Desired signal strength (1-15)
P = 1  # Actual page number
M = 2  # Max page number

while M < 25:
    while S != math.floor(1 + ((14 * (P - 1)) / (M - 1))):  # Strength formula
        if P == M:
            M += 1
            P = 0
        P += 1

    print('Possible combination (P / M):', P, "/", M)
    P += 1

</syntaxhighlight>

==== {{IN|Bedrock}} ====
{{IN|Bedrock}}, the formula is slightly different. Due to ''Bedrock Edition'' showing 2 pages at once and counting a change to the [[book]]'s output only if the highest even numbered page contains information, a [[redstone comparator]] treats books with 3 pages the same as those with 1 or 2 pages of information, the same as how ''Java Edition'' would treat a book with just 1 page.

For 4 or more pages of information use the following formula to calculate signal strength.

<math>S = \left\lfloor 1 + \frac{14(P'-1)}{M'-1} \right\rfloor</math>

In this case <math>M'</math> is half of the maximum page number rounded down, and <math>P'</math> is half of the current highest page number containing data displayed on the book interface, rounded down.

Rounding down is required to eliminate the discrepancy caused by [[book]]s containing an odd number of pages. For example, a book with 8 pages gives a signal strength of 15 when looking at pages 7-8. A book with 9 pages has a signal strength of 15 when looking at either pages 7-8 and 9-10.

In ''Bedrock Edition'', a [[book]] that steps up or down in increments of 1 per page turned must be exactly 30 pages long, with information left on page 30.

=== Fuel ===
Lecterns can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnaces]] to [[smelt]] 1.5 [[items]].

=== Note blocks ===
Lecterns can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sound.
