Modeled after the real-life  capsule in Redmond, WA, this in-game version lets you decorate it, store  treasures, and set a timer of up to 15 years to lock them away. Stored  items even get unique labels showing how long they’ve been preserved.  Save your treasures for memory lane |Minecraft Marketplace description}}
