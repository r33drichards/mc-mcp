A '''water lake''' was a small body of [[water]] source blocks in the [[Overworld]]. It could generate both on the surface and underground, in the latter case an air pocket would generate above it.

==Description==
Water lakes, which were bodies of water source blocks, could generate at any [[altitude]]. They could generate underground connected to [[cave]]s, or isolated, connected to no other structures whatsoever. When in a snowy biome, these small lakes were never initially frozen but turned to ice if exposed to the sky.

If a water lake generates with a small air pocket above it, there may be floating sand, floating snow cover, or even floating trees above the lake.

== Generation ==
Water lakes were common, generating in almost all Overworld biomes excluding the [[desert]] and [[Desert Hills|desert hills]] biomes. If they selected an altitude above the surface to generate, they would generate on the surface instead, leading to more water lakes present on the surface in biomes with lower altitude. 
 
{{IN|java}}, the air pockets above water lakes were generated with [[Air|cave air]] instead of normal air. This was true even for lakes that were exposed to the open sky.

[[Monster room]]s were able to generate attached to water lakes.
