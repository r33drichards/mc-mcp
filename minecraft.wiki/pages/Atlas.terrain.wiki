'''atlas.terrain''' is a [[texture atlas]] used to store block textures.

== Format ==
{{info needed section|
* Is it deterministic like ''Java Edition''<nowiki/>'s?
* If ''Minecraft Earth'' was based on the BE engine, does it also have this atlas?
* Does ''Minecraft Education'' have the same atlas as ''Bedrock Edition''?
}}
<samp>atlas.terrain</samp> is a 2048×1024 pixel file that is split into 16×16-pixel squares with 8 pixels of padding for blocks. It is generated from {{cd|terrain_textures.json}} in alphabetical order when a world is joined. If a texture is referenced multiple times, it will appear once in their first spot. If a broken or nonexistent texture is referenced, a [[missing texture]] will appear in its spot, even if there is a different missing texture before. This does not necessarily mean that the missing texture ends up being visible in-game for relevant such blocks.

Any textures added to terrain_textures.json in resource packs will be added to atlas.terrain, including ones in [[add-on]]s and when ''Minecraft Education'' features is enabled.

== Viewing ==
{{info needed section|
* method to export or even just see the atlas from versions a0.15.0-b1 to 1.1.7 without external programs
* method to get mipmapped versions without external programs}}
You can obtain the file by using a structure block set to 3d export mode There has to be a semi-transparent block like stained glass to export the right image. You can then convert it to a OBJ file and take out the correct one.{{info needed|check if this works in beta 1.2.0.2, or if it only became possible later}}

It can also be viewed by using a resource pack to change {{cd|items_texture.json}} to use {{cd|atlas.terrain}} for the texture name. This will cause items to use the wrong atlas.{{info needed|How far back do these work?}}

=== External programs ===
{{missing info|section|can this be used to obtain [[blocks-atlas]] and [[items-atlas]] from 13w18a to 13w37b? From testing it crashes in older versions.}}
{{disclaimer|section=1}}
Using external programs such as RenderDoc, you can obtain the texture atlas and its mipmapped versions. The image needs to be flipped vertically after being downloaded as a png.
