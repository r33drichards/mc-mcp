A '''fire wand''' is an item introduced in [[25w14craftmine]]. It uses the [[blaze rod]] texture with an [[enchantment glint]]. It has its other counterpart, the [[wind wand]].

== Obtaining ==
The fire wand is only obtainable without [[commands]] by getting the [[Player Unlocks|upgrade]] "Leaf", but by default this upgrade is obfuscated. Killing a [[blaze]] makes this upgrade readable.

== Usage ==
By default, the fire wand shoots out a [[fireball|ghast fireball]] when used.
