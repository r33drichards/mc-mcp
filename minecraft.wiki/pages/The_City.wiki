{{Quote|[[Brant]] didn’t even have to try to be cool. His parents were the richest people in The City and ran the redstone contraption company Redstone Co. Even though it was called Redstone Co., it dealt with a lot more than [[redstone]], and its contraptions and merchandise were basically what kept The City running these days. Redstone Co. got The City its [[coal]], [[iron]], [[wood]], brewing items, [[bonemeal]], [[lava]] source blocks for [[obsidian]], and so much more. Brant’s parents threw the best parties in The City, so naturally their son was popular.|The [[Redstone Company]]'s relation to the City}}
