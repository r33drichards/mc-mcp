== Revisions ==
The apk file for v0.1.0 alpha has different internal versions. Any other differences are currently unknown.

=== Versions ===

* Version: 0.1(1), Size: 1.65 MB
* Version: 0.1(2), Size: 1.61 MB 
* Version: 0.1(2), Size: 1.60 MB 

== Demo ==

A demo for Alpha 0.1.0 was released exclusively to the Xperia Play on an unknown date.
<!-- Not sure if this belongs here, but I've made a list of bugs for this version of the game that I've found -->

== "Canada" Demo ==
{{version conjecture|section=1}}
On August 17, 2011, an APK labeled <code>mcpe01_canada.apk</code> was uploaded to the pe/ directory of [[Minecraft.net#Developer URLs|assets.minecraft.net]]. Despite having the same package name as the full release, it is labeled on the main menu as a demo. Further differences from the demo released on Google Play are unknown, as is the reason for its creation and release.

== Touch Prototype ==
On September 27, 2011, an APK labeled <code>minecraftpe.apk</code> was uploaded to the pe/ directory of assets.minecraft.net. The most notable difference between this build and the Google Play release is that it has a prototype of the touch controls that would later be officially implemented in v0.1.1.
Unlike official releases, the Java code of the APK file is unobfuscated, suggesting that it might be a debug build.

=== Additions ===
* {{Version exclusive}}: Adds touchscreen [[Controls#Phones|controls]]
* New UI for touch screen devices.

== Bugs ==
* [[Fire]] is invisible, and due to uninitialized memory, can spread to any block, even if not normally flammable, including [[air]].<ref>{{link|url=https://youtu.be/3hrz7KK2EJs|title=https://youtu.be/3hrz7KK2EJs|website=YouTube|date=March 19, 2012}}</ref> <!-- Note: the bug is demonstrated in this video in v0.2.2, but it has been there since the start) -->
* Stairs are invisible when held
* Stairs are invisible when within a 16×16×16 chunk-aligned area with no other blocks
* The game will crash when an attempt to render an item in the hotbar is made
* TNT will not spawn a primed version of itself in the demo versions (though it tries) <!-- note: Actually, no non-player entity is allowed to spawn in demo versions. TODO: Is this also true in the paid versions? -->
* The pictures taken by a camera will include its smoke particles. <!-- note: Maybe this is not a bug, but rather, something else? -->
