'''Hermitcraft''', also written as '''HermitCraft''', is a private {{MC}} whitelisted server created for and run by several [[YouTube]]rs, referred to as Hermits, such as [[Mumbo Jumbo]] and [[Grian]]. It was founded by Generikb on April 12, 2012, and has continued growing with many vanilla and modded seasons, the most recent one being Season 11. The server is currently administered by Xisumavoid, one of the earliest members of the server. Its members, called Hermits, are popular Minecraft players who have been recognized by other Hermits and have been invited to join.  

== Hermits ==
The people who are part of Hermitcraft are often called ''Hermits''. They are popular Minecraft content creators and are chosen by the Hermits themselves. Currently, there are 25 whitelisted Hermits who participate in this server.

== Seasons ==
Over the years, there have been several seasons of Hermitcraft. Some of them are Vanilla Minecraft, while others are modded Minecraft. The first season started in 2012 and the latest vanilla season in 2025.

== Events and minigames ==
The Hermits regularly create minigames during the course of a season in order to keep things fun and interesting. Some of them have been so popular that they are now played throughout Minecraft. For example, the game 'Tag!’ was invented by Grian in Season 6, where one tries to get rid of a tag as fast as possible if they receive it. Another example is Tegg, where the objective of the game is to hide a dragon egg.

They also host server-wide events and activities for the Hermits to participate in and the audience to enjoy. For example, in The Prank War of Season 6, two sides of the Hermitcraft server fought due to pranks that were made before the war. Another example is the Big Moon Incident in Season 8, in which the Moon crashed on the world, ending the season.

Alongside that, they have also invented their own gameshows. Zedaph in particular created "Is That Sheep Looking At Me?" where three contestants played games involving sheep. This was played in Season 5, Season 6, and Season 10.
