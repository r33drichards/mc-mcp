The '''Purple Heart Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out as part of the [[15 Days of Minecraft|15 Days of ''Minecraft'']] celebrations, alongside the [[Follower's cape]] and the [[15th Anniversary cape]].

== Appearance ==
The cape includes a purple heart with streaks on a white background. The bottom corners are filled with purple right-angled triangles, paired with a purple hood at the top. It uses similar colors of the [[Twitch]] logo.

== Distribution ==
Players could receive this cape by [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem redeeming a code], which was obtainable by watching any ''Minecraft'' livestream on [[Twitch]] for 15 minutes. This event started on May 17, 2024 and ended on June 18, 2024.

This task could not be completed normally in regions where either Twitch or its rewards program were banned. Players in these regions could obtain the cape by circumventing the ban somehow (such as with a VPN), traveling to regions where they were not banned, or receiving a code from another player.
