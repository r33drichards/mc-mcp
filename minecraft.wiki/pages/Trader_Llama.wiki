A '''trader llama''' is a [[llama]] variant that spawns in pairs [[leash]]ed to [[wandering trader]]s. It behaves similarly to a regular llama, but becomes hostile if the wandering trader is attacked, and will despawn when the trader does unless the lead is removed.

== Spawning ==
{{See also|Wandering Trader#Spawning}}
Every [[wandering trader]] spawns with two [[leashed]] trader llamas.

== Drops ==
=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} upon successful breeding.

=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Leather|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}

* Any equipped {{blockLink|carpets}} and {{BlockLink|chest}}.
* All items in their [[inventory]].
* {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs if killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

Like other baby animals, killing a baby trader llama yields no [[item]] or [[experience]].

== Behavior ==
Trader llamas are neutral, retaliating when it or the associated wandering trader is attacked by a player or mob. Sometimes their spit can miss their target and hit another (trader) llama, starting a fight within a group of (trader) llamas. 

Trader llamas are hostile toward wolves and spit without provocation, but they don't attack tamed wolves unless provoked. Wolves are fearful of trader llamas of [[#Data values|strength]] 4 or 5 and always run away, and won't attack unless provoked by their spit.<ref>{{Bug|MC-107643||Wolf is indecisive around llamas while hostile toward the llama.|WAI}}</ref> Wolves flee from weaker trader llamas less often.

Trader llamas are also hostile towards [[zombies]], [[husks]], [[drowned]], [[zombie villagers]], [[pillagers]], [[vindicators]], [[evokers]], and [[illusioners]] {{only|Java}}.

Trader llamas are completely passive on [[Peaceful]] difficulty.

Trader llamas float when in water deeper than one block.

Trader llamas can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. They also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}).

Trader llamas have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

Unlike other neutral mobs, trader llamas don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

=== Spitting ===
{{anchor|Llama spit}}
{{main|Llama Spit|title1=Llama spit}}
Trader llamas attack other mobs by spitting at them, dealing {{hp|1}} damage. Trader llama spit is not flammable.

=== Taming ===
A trader llama lead by a wandering trader is untamable and cannot be ridden. It becomes [[tamable]]{{only|je|short=1}} or immediately tamed{{only|be|short=1}} and does not despawn once it is unleashed from the wandering trader.

Trader llamas can be tamed by repetitively riding them until hearts are displayed, done by pressing {{control|use}} on the llama while holding nothing. Tamed trader llamas do not despawn.

Taming success depends on the trader llama's <code>Temper</code> value. <code>Temper</code> is a positive trait, with higher values increasing the chance of successful taming. Llamas begin with a <code>Temper</code> value of 0 and a maximum of 30. When a player rides an untamed trader llama, a random number from 0 to 29 is chosen. The trader llama gets tamed successfully if this number is less than the <code>Temper</code> value, otherwise, the <code>Temper</code> is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. <code>Temper</code> can also be increased by feeding the llama.

Tamed trader llamas do not spit at mobs that attack its owner, although it spits at any mob that attacks the llama. Tamed trader llamas can still retaliate at players should the player hit them.

Feeding a trader llama food can alter its behavior, increasing its temper value if untamed, restoring lost health or making a baby grow faster (babies ordinarily take around 20 minutes to mature to adults). The table below lists the effects of the 2 food items llamas accept.

A trader llama can be fed by holding a valid food item and pressing {{control|use}} while facing the llama. Llamas can be fed only when feeding would have an effect, similar to other animals. If the food is invalid, the player mounts the llama instead.

=== Breeding ===
Adult tamed trader llamas can be bred by being fed a [[hay bale]]. The baby trader llama takes on the coat color of one parent at random. Its strength is chosen as a random integer between 1 and the strength of the stronger parent, inclusive. 3% of the time the resulting strength is increased by 1, but it is capped at 5. 

When two trader llamas are bred, the offspring wears the same unique rug to all trader llamas.

{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |Stronger parent's strength
! colspan="5" |Offspring's strength
|-
!1 !!2 !!3 !!4 !!5
|-
!1
|97% ||3% || || ||
|-

|48.5% ||50% ||1.5% || ||

|24.25% ||25% ||25% ||25% ||0.75%
|-
!5
|19.4% ||20% ||20% ||20% ||20.6%
|}

Select a row based on the stronger parent. The column shows the probability of the resulting offspring having a given strength.

A llama's base health ({{hp|15}} to {{hp|30}}) is calculated based on that of its parents, in the same way as a [[horse]]'s.

Color variant of llamas is randomly selected between parents.

When breeding a trader llama with a normal llama the offspring will always be a normal llama.

=== Caravans ===
Trader llamas form a caravan when one of them is [[leashed]] by a [[player]].

Leashing a trader llama signals up to 9 nearby llamas that are not already in a caravan to follow each other, forming a caravan of up to ten llamas. When multiple llamas are leashed, each leashed llama can form a separate caravan of up to ten separate llamas. Each caravan cannot have two or more leashed llamas in it, and there is no limit to the number of caravans a player can lead.

=== Storage ===
[[File:Trader Llama GUI.png|thumb|right|The GUI of a trader llama.]]
A tamed trader llama can be equipped with a [[chest]] by pressing the {{control|use}} control on it while holding a chest. The chest gives the trader llama 3 to 15 slots of inventory space, depending on its strength (see table below). Once equipped, its contents can be accessed by pressing the {{control|use}} control on the llama while [[sneaking]], or by opening the inventory while riding the llama. The chest itself cannot be retrieved without killing the trader llama.

|}

=== Carpets ===
[[File:All Llama swag patterns.png|thumb|right|350px|All llama carpet patterns.]]
A trader llama can be equipped with a wool [[carpet]] in its carpet slot. Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug when on the llama's back. This can be useful for color-coding the llamas as storage containers, like dyed [[shulker box]]es. A trader llama that does not have a carpet wears a unique blue rug design. This design can be replaced with a carpet but never removed. 

When given carpets, all types of (trader) llamas look the same, except for their fur colors. {{IN|java}}, a trader llama's carpet decoration remains visible when the llama is under the effect of [[Invisibility]];<ref>{{bug|MC-110423||Invisibility effect don't affect the second layer skins of stray and llama|WAI}}</ref> {{in|bedrock}}, it becomes invisible.

For the purposes of the {{cmd|item}} command, a trader llama carries its carpet in the <code>armor.body</code> slot.

=== Despawning ===<!--the stuff about despawning can be tightened up and possibly verified. Trader llamas don't despawn unless they are leashed according to their earlier information given, but this section says being unleashed speeds up thier despawning-->
Trader llamas often{{more info|how often?}} despawn one tick before their trader does, because a trader llama has its <code>DespawnDelay</code> set to 47999 ticks. This value is decremented each tick that the llama is untamed, unleashed{{more info|but I thought unleashed trader llamas don't despawn?}}, and not being ridden by a player, and is reset to one tick less than the trader's own <code>DespawnDelay</code> if leashed to a trader. The llama despawns when its <code>DespawnDelay</code> reaches zero ticks.
