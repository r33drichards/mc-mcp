== Usage ==

=== Food ===
To eat cooked salmon, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|6}} and 9.6 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]], the same as [[cooked mutton]].

=== Wolves ===
Cooked salmon can be fed to [[wolves]] only if they are not at full health, healing them by {{hp|12|mob=1}}. However, {{in|Bedrock}}, unlike other wolf food, cooked salmon cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves nor used to breed them and can only be fed to a wolf that is not at full health.
