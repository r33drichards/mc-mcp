* Updated the horse model yet again.
** The mane, as well as the tail, are longer.

* Improved performance of command parsing & data pack loading.
* Improved performance of command execution.
* Added commands to the profiler (/debug).
* {{cmd|data get}} with a <code>path</code> now works on non-numeric values.
** Retrieving a string now sets the length of the string as the <code>result</code> of the command.
** Retrieving a list now sets the number of elements in that list as the <code>result</code> of the command.
** Retrieving a compound now sets the number of tags that are directly in that compound as the <code>result</code> of the command.
* Added the {{cmd|particle <name> <pos>}} shortcut.
** <code>delta</code>, <code>speed</code>, and <code>count</code> default to 0.
