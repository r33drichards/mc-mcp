'''1.4.3''' is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.4.4]], released on November 1, 2012,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-1-4-3-pre-release|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2012/11/minecraft-1-4-3-pre-release|title=Minecraft 1.4.3 Pre-release|date=November 1, 2012|author=[[Jens Bergensten]]|website=[[Mojang.com]]}}</ref> which adds a new [[music disc]] and fixes many bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Music disc]]'''
* Implemented the music disc "[[wait]]".
** This music disc was originally added to the game's files in [[Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2]] named "where are we now", but could not be implemented due to issues with the spaces in its name, so it has been renamed to "wait".

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|B}} now shows the [[hitbox]] around [[entities]].
** At this point, the hitbox is white and opaque and does not have an outline.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Trapdoor]]'''
* Can now be placed on the side of a single [[slab]].

'''[[Wall]]s'''
* Now have a bigger hitbox; previously they shared the [[fence]] hitbox.<ref>{{bug|MC-1332}}</ref>

'''[[Water]]'''
* Water now completely negates all fall damage.<ref>{{bug|MC-1644||Players and mobs do not die from great heights in shallow water|Works as Intended}}</ref>
*Players can no longer swim against the current of water.

=== Gameplay ===
* Switching tools resets a block's brokenness.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* [[Wall]] block [[Hitbox|collision box]]es no longer lose precision at extreme coordinates.
** This is almost certaintly due to the fix for {{bug|MC-1332}}.
