'''Weakness''' is an [[effect]] that decreases attack damage. It is required to cure [[zombie villager]]s.

== Effect ==
Melee damage inflicted by the affected entity is reduced by {{hp|4}} × level {{in|java}}. Negative levels increase melee [[damage]] dealt.

{{IN|bedrock}}, melee damage under the Weakness effect can be found through the equation <math>BaseDamage\times0.8^{level}+{0.8^{level}-1\over0.4}</math> where <math>BaseDamage</math> is the ''default'' attack damage with whatever weapon or tool is used to attack.<ref group=note>Background for the new equation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GtZ9ceTfVGbEkKkbZAfzpKKGk2FQ0FwmeUyw5ja14B8/edit?usp=sharing</ref><ref group="note">To find the damage when [[Strength]] and Weakness are applied at the same time, first calculate the damage with the Strength formula, then plug that in as the "<math>BaseDamage</math>" in this Weakness formula.</ref>

Attacks that deal {{hp|0}} or less due to Weakness will fail to connect entirely, making them do no [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]]. However, by use of damage-increasing enchantments such as [[Sharpness]], [[Smite]], [[Bane of Arthropods]], or [[Impaling]], attacks will always connect. This effect is also used to cure [[zombie villager]]s, preceding the [[golden apple]]. The effect can be removed by drinking [[milk]]. {{IN|education|bedrock}} when education options are enabled, drinking [[elixir]] also removes Weakness.

== Exceptions ==
Weakness does not affect the damage of [[spear]] charge attacks,<ref>{{cite bug|MC|302778|Strength, Weakness and any other attack_damage attribute modifiers do not impact damage dealt by spears when performing charge attacks|resolution=Unresolved}}</ref> or the damage of [[ranged attack]]s.
