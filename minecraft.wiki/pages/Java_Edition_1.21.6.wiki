=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Happy Ghast.gif|32px]] [[Happy ghast]]'''
* Spawned after a [[ghastling]] grows up.
* Has {{hp|20}} [[health points]].
* A rideable entity, which can be equipped with a [[harness]] and ridden by up to four players.
** When a player mounts, the goggles on the happy ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it now can be controlled.
** Players mounted after the first player piloting the happy ghast are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player.
** Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top.
** 3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted.
** If players dismount midair, the happy ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming.
* The first player that mounts the happy ghast will control it, sitting in front of the happy ghast, just above its face.
** Pressing the forward key will make the happy ghast fly in the direction the player is looking.
** Pressing the back key will make the happy ghast fly in the opposite direction the player is looking.
** Pressing the left and right keys will strafe the happy ghast in the respective direction.
** Pressing the jump key will make the happy ghast fly directly up.
* Can be stood on, similar to a [[shulker]].
** If the happy ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction.
*** This happens regardless of it having a harness equipped or not.
* When not being ridden, can be tempted by players holding [[snowball]]s and [[harness]]es.
** However, they can not be bred.
** Harness tempting only works if the happy ghast is unharnessed.
* Has no panic behavior when taking damage.
* Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered.
* Can be burned by [[fire]] and [[lava]], as opposed to regular [[ghast]]s.
* Cannot enter [[boats]], but can enter [[minecart]]s.
* When there are no players mounted or walking on the happy ghast, the goggles go up and the happy ghast starts to roam around the home position (the home position is where the ghastling was hydrated as a dried ghast).
* Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position in the similar way as the [[ghastling]].
** If wearing a harness, the happy ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks).
** The happy ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own.
* Does not drop anything other than [[experience]].

'''[[File:Ghastling (pre-release).gif|32px]] [[Ghastling]]'''
*The baby variant of the [[happy ghast]].
* Spawned after a [[dried ghast]] gets hydrated in [[water]].
** Can also be summoned using the command: {{cmd|/summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000} }}, or by using a happy ghast spawn egg on a happy ghast.
* Has {{hp|20}} health points.
* Will grow up into a happy ghast after about 20 minutes.
** Can be tempted and fed using [[snowball]]s to speed up their growth.<!-- By how much? -->
* After spawning, a ghastling will try to follow:
** Players within a 16-block radius.
** Or an adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius.<!-- Which neutral mobs? -->
* If no player or suitable mob is close around the ghastling, it will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with).
** It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home area.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added 2 new advancements:
** Stay Hydrated!
*** Place a [[Dried Ghast]] block into water
** Heart Transplanter
*** Place a [[Creaking Heart]] with the correct alignment between two [[Pale Oak Log]] blocks

'''[[Locator bar]]'''
* A UI element on the player [[HUD]] that displays the direction of other [[player]]s in the world. It is displayed in place of the [[experience]] bar.[[File:Survival Locator Bar.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|Locator bar in [[Survival]] mode.]]
** Visible when on a server with at least one other unhidden player and when experience is not being gained.
* By default, all [[player]]s transmit a waypoint from themselves, and all players receive all waypoints, allowing players to locate other players in multiplayer.
* The locator bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards a waypoint. If a waypoint is above/below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up/down arrow will display.
* Any waypoint that is determined to be a player or [[mob]] that belongs to a Team then the color indicator will match the team color.
* Can be toggled with {{gmr|locatorBar}} game rule.
* Crouching will hide the player, preventing them from appearing on the locator bar of other players.
* Wearing a mob head also hides players from the locator bar.
* [[Spectator]]s are only visible to other spectators on the locator bar.
* Waypoints' icon use different sprites based on how far away the player is to their locations.

'''[[Music]]'''
* Added 5 new [[music|background music]] tracks by [[Amos Roddy]] to [[cherry grove]], [[forest]], [[desert]], [[grove]], and [[lush caves]] biomes:
** "[[Below and Above]]"
** "[[Broken Clocks]]"
** "[[Fireflies (song)|Fireflies]]"

=== General ===
'''[[Controls]]'''

** Prints client-side version information.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Carved pumpkin]] and [[head]]s'''
* Will hide players from the [[locator bar]] when worn in the head slot.

'''[[Firefly bush]]'''
* Now produces larger and more constant amounts of particles.

=== Items ===
'''[[Firework rocket]]'''
* Firework rockets now are only used as a boost when gliding with an elytra, even if it is placed on a block mid-air.

'''[[Lead]]'''
* Leashed leads are now rendered twice as thick, to match ''Bedrock Edition''.
* The [[slimeball]] in the recipe was replaced with a [[string]].
{{crafting
|A1=String |B1=String
|A2=String |B2=String
|C3=String
|Output=Lead,2
|ignoreusage = 1
}}
* Leads can now be used to leash two mobs together.
** Sneak-interact on any mob while holding a bunch of leashed mobs will leash these mobs to the interacted entity.
** It's not possible to leash anything to itself.
* If the re-leashing of an entity would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance, the re-leashing would not happen.
* Leads can be snipped from an entity when interacting them with [[shears]], which consumes their [[durability]].
** This applies to its own leash connection as well as all entities attached to it.
** [[Dispenser]]s can now snip leashes from entities in front of them when they are equipped with [[shears]]; this also consumes their [[durability]].
* The leash mechanics were improved, with reworked leash physics, allowing for more stable leash connection, especially when leashed entities are not on ground.
** When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher.
** Using a firework rocket when flying with leashed entities will now break the leash connections.
* When leashing an already leashed mob, the current leash will now snap and a player will re-leash the object to the player.
** It's not possible to steal leashed entities from other players.
* The interactions with a [[leash knot]] and [[fence]] blocks have changed:
** When interacting with a leash knot or a [[fence]], if there are any player-leashed entities in range of the leash knot, they will be re-leashed to the leash knot or a [[fence]].
** In case of attaching of mobs fails due to distance or there is nothing to attach, the player will now transfer all fence leashed entities to itself.
** If there is nothing left attached to the leash knot, it disappears.
** Sneak-interact can only result in attaching of the player mobs to the [[fence]].
** Interacting with [[shears]] or punching the leash knot will result in all current connections broken.
* Boats, as well as large mobs that can be leashed but cannot fit in a boat ([[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[camel]]s and [[sniffer]]s), can now be leashed in a special 4-leash configuration to the [[happy ghast]].
** Happy ghast will also present a custom layer when it's leashing something using a quad connection.
** Leashes in quad connection are rendered without slack.
* Leash snapping distance has been changed from 10 to 12 blocks.
** The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes, rather than their feet is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities.
** Happy ghast leash is now longer - with free roaming distance of 10 blocks and leash snapping at 16 blocks.

'''[[Leather]]'''
* Can now be found in [[monster room]], [[ancient city]], [[desert temple]], [[jungle temple]], and [[stronghold]] altar chests in quantities 1-5.

'''[[Potion of invisibility]]'''

|B2 = Iron Ingot
|C2 = Leather
|Output = Saddle
|ignoreusage = 1
}}
* No longer found in chests in [[monster room]]s, [[ancient cities]], [[desert temple]]s, [[jungle temple]]s, or [[stronghold]] altars.

'''[[Shears]]'''
* Can now remove [[saddle]]s, [[horse armor]], [[harness]]es and [[carpet]]s from mobs.
** They cannot be removed if the mob has a rider.
** They cannot be removed if the player is crouching.
* Saddles cannot be removed from ravagers.
* Dispensers with shears cannot remove saddles, horse armor, harnesses and carpets equipped on mobs.

'''[[Carrot]]'''
* Can now be used to [[Taming|tame]], heal, and grow [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, and [[mule]]s.

* [[Blaze]] and [[breeze]] egg size changed from "large" to "medium".

=== Mobs ===
'''{{animate|Ghast_JE3_BE3.gif;Ghast_shooting_JE3_BE4.png|32px}} [[Ghast]]s'''
* Updated their texture to be higher resolution, matching the new happy ghast.
* Now drop a [[Music Disc Tears|”Tears” music disc]] when killed by a player-deflected [[fireball]].

'''[[Horse]], [[donkey]], and [[mule]]'''

'''[[Wolves]]''', '''[[sheep]]''' and '''[[pig]]s'''
* Now have their legs mirrored.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Projectile]]s'''
* Projectiles now have a target tolerance margin that changes over time.
** All projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight.
** After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous fixed 0.3 blocks margin.
** This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Woodland mansion]]'''
* The room "{{cd|1x1_b5.nbt}}" generates again.

=== Gameplay ===

* Added an option to the Music & Sound settings, "Music Frequency", that allows players to change how frequently music plays while in a game world.
** Settings are Default, Frequent and Constant.
** Default is the normal delay between 10 - 20 minutes
** Frequent halves the delay to 5 minutes and Constant sets the delay to 5 seconds.
* Added an option to the Music & Sound settings, "Show Music Toast", that enables a music toast to be shown whenever a song starts playing.

** If the entities are grouped together, they will receive the same effect strength.

=== General ===
'''[[Clouds]]'''
* Clouds now exist all the way to the horizon.
* Updated the pattern of clouds in the sky.<!-- Image? -->

'''[[Controls]]'''
* A new keybind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow users to access a set of content-configured dialogs.
** Default key: {{Key|G}}
** This feature is configured by {{cd|minecraft:quick_actions}} dialog tag.
*** If this tag is empty, the keybind does nothing.
*** If this tag has a single element, the keybind will open this dialog.
*** If this tag has multiple elements, the keybind will lead to {{cd|minecraft:quick_actions}} dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements.
*** If this dialog is removed, the keybind does nothing.
** This option is intended to be used in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty by default.

'''[[Credits]]'''

* This feature replaces "Server Links" button and is placed on Pause screen according to the same rules
* Buttons leading to dialogs exposed in this way will use label described in {{cd|external_title}} field
* This feature is configured by {{cd|minecraft:pause_screen_additions}} dialog tag:
** If this tag is not specified or is empty but the server has sent {{cd|server_links}} packet, tag will be handled as if it contained {{cd|minecraft:server_links}} dialog
*** Note: this matches previous Server Links feature behavior
*** If this dialog is removed, the tag remains empty
** If this tag is still empty, button is not visible ("Send Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons are visible instead)
** If this tag has a single element, Pause screen button will lead directly to this dialog
** If this tag has multiple elements, Pause screen button will lead to {{cd|minecraft:custom_options}} which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements
*** If this dialog is removed, button is not visible

'''[[Realms]]'''

'''{{cmd|dialog}}'''
* A new command that shows dialog to clients.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|dialog show <targets> <dialog>}}
*** Show dialog to player(s).
*** {{cd|<targets>}} - player name, UUID or a player selector.
*** {{cd|<dialog>}} - a namespaced ID from {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry or inline dialog value as described above.
*** Returns number of players in targets argument.
** {{cmd|dialog clear <targets>}}
*** Clean dialog for player(s), if they have any visible.
*** {{cd|<targets>}} - player name, UUID or a player selector.
*** Returns number of players in targets argument.

'''{{cmd|version}}'''
* No arguments.
* Prints current version information on server side.
* Available in singleplayer or for server operators.

'''{{cmd|waypoint}}'''
* A new command for querying and modifying waypoints.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|waypoint list}}
** {{cmd|waypoint modify <entity-selector> color <color>}}
** {{cmd|waypoint modify <entity-selector> color hex <hex-color>}}
** {{cmd|waypoint modify <entity-selector> color reset}}
** {{cmd|waypoint modify <entity-selector> style set <style>}}
** {{cmd|waypoint modify <entity-selector> style reset}}
* Parameters:
** {{cd|entity-selector}}: For selecting entities that are transmitting as waypoints (see {{attr|waypoint_transmit_range}} attribute).
** {{cd|color}}: Overrides the locator bar icon color for this waypoint.
** {{cd|hex <hex-color>}} arguments are in web format (RRGGBB).
*** Red is either hex F00 or hex FF0000.
*** Cornflower blue is hex 6495ED.
** {{cd|style}}: For changing the icon spriteset and selection distances.
*** Sets the [[waypoint style]] from {{cd|waypoint_style}} directory in a [[resource pack]].
*** By default, it is set to {{cd|default}}.
** {{cd|set <waypoint_style/resource>}} changes the style to a specific asset under {{cd|waypoint_style/}}
** The game does not check if a definition exists under the directory, setting it to a non-existent definition will result in a [[missing texture]] for the waypoint.
*** {{cd|reset}} will restore the default icon behavior of the Locator Bar.

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Locator bar]]'''
* Can be toggled with {{gmr|locatorBar}} game rule.
* Has a [[waypoint style]] for changing waypoints' icon on specific distances in a [[resource pack]].
** Setting the style of a waypoint is possible using the new {{cmd|waypoint modify ... style}} arguments.
** The default implementation is as such:<br><syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
  "near_distance": 128,
  "far_distance": 332,
  "sprites": [
    "minecraft:default_0",
    "minecraft:default_1",
    "minecraft:default_2",
    "minecraft:default_3"
  ]
}</syntaxhighlight>
** {{cd|near_distance}} and {{cd|far_distance}} are optional and default to the values {{cd|128}} and {{cd|332}} respectively.
*** {{cd|far_distance}} distance must be greater than {{cd|near_distance}}
** Each sprite is searched within the prefix of {{cd|hud/locator_bar_dot/}} (the directory {{cd|textures/gui/sprites/hud/locator_bar_dot}}).

'''[[POI]]'''
* Added the <code>test_instance</code> POI.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Added <code>entity/leashknot/break</code> for when a [[lead]] snaps.
* The following sounds have been added for [[shear]]ing [[saddle]]s, [[horse armor]], and [[carpet]]s from [[llama]]s.

** Can trigger when a player shears off a shearable equipment from an entity.
** Conditions:
*** {{cd|item}} - Item that is sheared.
*** {{cd|entity}} - The entity that was sheared.

'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Added {{attr|camera_distance}}
** Default value: {{cd|4.0}}
** Modifies the distance at which the camera is placed away from the player or spectated entity when in a third-person view.
** If the entity being ridden has a larger {{attr|camera_distance}} attribute, that distance will be used.
** This distance is multiplied by the scale attribute to get a final target camera distance.

* Added {{attr|waypoint_transmit_range}} and {{attr|waypoint_receive_range}}.
** Default: {{cd|0.0}}, Minimum: {{cd|0.0}}, Maximum: {{cd|60000000.0}}.
** Players have a default transmission and receive range of 60,000,000.
** Mobs with a transmission range above zero will send waypoint packets to nearby receivers.
** Similarly, receivers only receive with a range above zero, and cannot receive waypoints outside of this range.
** Examples:
*** {{cd|/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 0}} prevents a player from transmitting (hiding them)
*** {{cd|/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_transmit_range base set 80}} lets a player transmit up to 80 blocks (hiding them from players further than that)
*** {{cd|/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 0}} prevents a player from receiving any waypoints information
*** {{cd|/attribute @s minecraft:waypoint_receive_range base set 120}} lets a player see waypoints that are within 120 blocks (hiding all players further than that)

'''[[Dialog]]s'''
* Added a way to display simple modal dialogs to a user.
* Dialogs are stored in a {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry, but can also be defined inline
* Dialogs are an experimental feature.
* To avoid user confusion, dialog screens are marked with a warning sign next to the title.
** Clicking on this warning leads to a dialog that explains to user that this screen is provided by custom content.
** It also gives user an option to leave current world to avoid them being locked in infinite loop of dialogs.
* Dialogs can be displayed by server in {{cd|play}} and {{cd|configuration}} connection phases.
** However, only inline registries are allowed in {{cd|configuration}}, since registries are not yet available in that phase.
* Dialogs always close after user selects any action.
* Dialogs by default will also close after {{key|Escape}} key is pressed.
** When this happens, dialog will run action specific to dialog type described as "exit action" below.
** This behavior is configurable.
* When dialog screen is closed, game goes back to previously displayed non-dialog screen or back to gameplay.
** That means that new dialogs always replace already opened ones, if any.
* Dialogs screens will pause the game in singleplayer mode.
* Dialogs can be configured to be accessible from Pause menu.
** This replaces and expands "Server Links" button added in previous versions.
* Most dialogs follow a common layout, however exact contents depend on type:
** Header with title and warning button.
** Body elements (labels, inputs, buttons and submit actions), scrollable if needed.
** Optional footer, contains main buttons and submit actions.
* {{cd|run_command}} click actions will correctly close dialogs and book screens even if the command does not require elevated permissions.
* If a new dialog is received by the client while warning screen is visible, it will not replace it, but when user clicks the "Back" button, the new dialog will be restored instead.
* The sizes of elements in dialogs are restricted:
** buttons - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|1024}} (inclusive).
** {{cd|minecraft:plain_message}} dialog body - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|1024}} (inclusive).
** {{cd|minecraft:item}} dialog body
*** {{cd|width}} of {{cd|description}} - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|1024}} (inclusive).
*** {{cd|width}} - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|256}} (inclusive).
*** {{cd|height}} - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|256}} (inclusive).
** {{cd|minecraft:text}} input control - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|1024}} (inclusive).
** {{cd|minecraft:single_option}} input control - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|1024}} (inclusive).
** {{cd|minecraft:number_range}} input control - between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|1024}} (inclusive).
* Dialogs can configure if they pause the game and if they close after an action is taken.
* Every dialog can have inputs and can submit information.
** The order of elements is:
*** Body

* Dialogs are stored in {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry that can be provided by a datapack
** Fields:
*** {{cd|type}} - one of dialog types from minecraft:dialog_type registry
*** {{cd|<type-specific>}} - see below.

* Common dialog fields
** Most dialog types share some fields.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|title}}
**** Screen title, text component.
***** Should be always visible on screen, no matter the specific type.
*** {{cd|external_title}}
**** Name to be used for a button leading to this dialog (for example from pause screen), optional text component.
***** If not present, {{cd|title}} will be used instead.
*** {{cd|body}} 
**** Optional list of body elements or a single element.
*** {{cd|can_close_with_escape}}
**** Can dialog be dismissed with {{key|Escape}} key, default {{cd|true}}.
*** {{cd|pause}} - if the dialog screen should pause the game in single-player mode, default: {{cd|true}}.
*** {{cd|after_action}} - an additional operation performed on the dialog after click or submit actions, default: {{cd|close}}.
**** {{cd|close}} - closes the dialog and returns to the previous non-dialog screen (if any).
**** {{cd|none}} - does nothing, i.e. keeps the current dialog screen open.
***** Only available if pause is false to avoid locking the game in single-player mode.
**** {{cd|wait_for_response}} - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen.
***** Servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog.
***** To avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds.
****** Clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e. the game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any).
***** The "Waiting for Response" screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game.

* Common button data
** Most actions in dialog types share following fields that describe appearance of a button associated with that action:
*** {{cd|label}}- text component.
*** {{cd|tooltip}} - optional text component to display when button is highlighted or hovered over.

'''[[Shader]]s'''
* All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms.
* Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks.
* Uniform definitions inside [[JSON]] files are now per-block.
* Added two new core shaders; <code>stars</code>, and <code>sky</code> which are used to render the stars and upper portion of the sky respectively.

* Shader fog
** The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based.
** Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms.
** Environmental fog is supposed to represent the "fogginess" of the environment the player is in: lava, water, and now also atmosphere.
** Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain.
** Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance.
** The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both.

* Post-process effect definitions
** Entries in the targets map have been expanded to support new properties.
*** New optional boolean field: {{cd|persistent}}
**** Default: {{cd|false}}
**** If true, this render target will be persistent across frames.
**** The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized.
*** New optional field: {{cd|clear_color}} 
**** Default: {{cd|[0, 0, 0, 0]}}
**** Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order {{cd|[R, G, B, A]}}
**** When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color.
** The uniforms values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list.
*** e.g. <code>uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }</code>
**** The order of uniforms in a block must match the order in the shader.
** {{cd|name}} as part of a uniform definition is no longer used.
** {{cd|value}} as part of a uniform definition replaces the old {{cd|values}}, and the type depends on the {{cd|type}} field.
*** This field is required.
*** {{cd|"type": "int"}} needs {{cd|"value": 123}} (a single int).
*** {{cd|"type": "float"}} needs {{cd|"value": 123.4}} (a single float).
*** {{cd|"type": "vec2"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.2, 3.4]}} (two floats).
*** {{cd|"type": "vec3"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]}} (three floats).
*** {{cd|"type": "ivec3"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1, 2, 3]}} (three ints).
*** {{cd|"type": "vec4"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]}} (four floats).
*** {{cd|"type": "matrix4x4"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0]}} (four rows of four columns of floats).

* Post-process effect shaders
** Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks.
*** They will be set according to the pass definition in the JSON file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders.
** The list of sizes (all {{cd|vec2 *Size}} uniforms) are now replaced with a single {{cd|SamplerInfo}} uniform block.
*** This contains, in order, the size of the output texture followed by the size every input texture.
*** The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform.
*** For most post chains this is just {{cd|OutSize}} and {{cd|InSize}} as before.

== Fixes ==
* The fix to [[bugtracker:MC-3697|MC-3697]] has been partially reverted. Decorative hanging entities such as paintings and item frames are now immune to explosions from submerged TNT while items and armor stands are once again vulnerable to them.
* Reverted the fix for [[bugtracker:MC-101556|MC-101556]]: Nether Portal teleport range is too large (equivalent to a full block)
