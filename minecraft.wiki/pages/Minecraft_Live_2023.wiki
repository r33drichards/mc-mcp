The mob vote had three mobs to vote on: the [[crab]], the [[armadillo]], and the [[penguin]]. [[Jens Bergensten]] described the options as “cute animals” at the Minecraft China Developers Conference held in Chengdu, China on September 27.<ref>https://bilibili.com/video/BV1uw411m7vY</ref>

This was the final edition of the mob vote, as it was retired the following year.<ref>{{mcnet|the-future-of-minecrafts-development|The future of Minecraft's development|September 9, 2024|Ryan Cooper}}</ref>

==== Crab ====
{{main|Crab}}
The [[crab]] spawns in [[mangrove swamp]]s. The player can obtain a crab claw which allows them to place and break blocks from further away. [[Kelp]] can be used to breed crabs. Crabs also occasionally wave at players and other crabs. <ref name="China" /><ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-crab|Mob Vote: Crab|October 3, 2023|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
{{yt|qElvTW-8-W8}}

==== Armadillo ====
{{main|Armadillo}}
The [[armadillo]] spawns in [[savanna]]s. It can become startled and hide in its shell when the player confronts it; it can also drop scutes (not necessarily from dying), which will be used to craft armor for [[wolf|wolves]], offering them better protection during combat.<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-armadillo|Mob Vote: Armadillo|October 4, 2023|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
{{yt|jNTufMgx6eM}}

==== Penguin ====
{{main|Penguin}}
The [[penguin]] spawns on the [[stony shore]] biome. Penguins increase the speed of the player's [[boat]]. Penguins are amphibious, living both in the water and on land. Although clumsy when walking and might fall down occasionally, the penguins are excellent swimmers and can swim as fast as the [[dolphin]]s. They gather in groups.<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-penguin|Mob Vote: Penguin|October 5, 2023|Sophie Austin}}</ref><ref name="China" />
