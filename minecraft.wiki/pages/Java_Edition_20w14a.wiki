== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Compass]]'''
* Now has <code>LodestonePos</code>, <code>LodestoneDimension</code>, and <code>LodestoneTracked</code> data fields. If <code>LodestoneTracked</code> is zero, the game skips checking for a [[lodestone]] in the specified position.
* Can now be enchanted with [[Curse of Vanishing]].

'''[[Warped fungus on a stick]]'''
* Now has 100 durability instead of 25.
* Takes 1 damage whenever the strider's speed is boosted.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Hoglin]]s'''
* Now become [[zoglin]]s in the Overworld.
* Now avoid [[nether portal]]s and [[respawn anchor]]s.

'''[[Piglin]]s'''
* Now avoid zoglins in the same way they avoid [[zombified piglin]]s.

'''[[Strider]]s'''
* Riding speed has now been significantly increased to be even faster than that of a boat.{{more info|Actual numbers for comparison}}

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The advancements "Monster Hunter" and "Monsters Hunted" now include [[elder guardian]]s, [[ender dragon]]s, [[endermite]]s, [[vex]]es, [[wither]]s, and [[zoglin]]s.

'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* Items and entities no longer keep unknown attributes.
* Names of some attributes have been renamed to meet [[resource location]] requirements (i.e., lowercase separated by underscores instead of camel case).
** Changed {{cd|generic.maxHealth|d=to|generic.max_health}}.
** Changed {{cd|zombie.spawnReinforcements|d=to|zombie.spawn_reinforcements}}.
** Changed {{cd|horse.jumpStrength|d=to|horse.jump_strength}}.
** Changed {{cd|generic.followRange|d=to|generic.follow_range}}.
** Changed {{cd|generic.knockbackResistance|d=to|generic.knockback_resistance}}.
** Changed {{cd|generic.movementSpeed|d=to|generic.movement_speed}}.
** Changed {{cd|generic.flyingSpeed|d=to|generic.flying_speed}}.
** Changed {{cd|generic.attackDamage|d=to|generic.attack_damage}}
** Changed {{cd|generic.attackKnockback|d=to|generic.attack_knockback}}
** Changed {{cd|generic.attackSpeed|d=to|generic.attack_speed}}
** Changed {{cd|generic.armorToughness|d=to|generic.armor_toughness}}.

'''[[Main menu]]'''
* The main menu background is now in the Nether.
** Since this was an asset update, all of the 1.16 snapshots have the new backdrop.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* General statistics are now ordered alphabetically in the statistics menu.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added nether portals and respawn anchors to the {{cd|hoglin_repellents}} block tag.

'''World save files'''
* [[Anvil file format|Region files]] are now read/written in synchronous mode to help prevent data loss and corruption after crash.
** Dedicated servers can disable that by changing {{cd|sync-chunk-writes}} inside <samp>[[server.properties]]</samp>.

== Trivia ==
* Unlike most of the first-of-the-week actual snapshots, this was released on a Thursday instead of Wednesday, similar to the snapshots before [[14w26a]].
** This is because an April Fools' joke snapshot [[Java Edition 20w14infinite]] was released on April 1, 2020, which is a Wednesday.
