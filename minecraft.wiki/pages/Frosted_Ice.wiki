'''Frosted ice''' is a translucent [[solid block|block]] created when a [[mob]] or [[entity]] wearing [[Frost Walker]]-enchanted [[boots]] moves over [[water]]. It cannot be obtained as an [[item]] and will quickly crack and melt if exposed to [[light]] or [[sunlight]].

== Obtaining ==
Frosted ice only exists as an item {{in|BE}}, where it can be obtained using {{Cmd|give}}. Otherwise it can be placed with {{cmd|setblock}} or {{cmd|fill}}.

=== Breaking ===
Frosted ice does not have a preferred [[tool]], meaning it breaks at the same speed regardless of the tool used to mine it.<ref>{{bug|MC-144593||Break speed of frosted ice is unaffected by efficiency}}</ref> Breaking it with [[Silk Touch]] drops nothing, while breaking in any other manner produces water in the same way [[ice]] does.
{{Breaking row|Frosted Ice|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Post-generation ===
Frosted ice is generated by players or mobs walking near water while wearing boots with the [[Frost Walker]] enchantment. Frost Walker II creates a larger area of frosted ice. It can also be created by [[armor stand]]s equipped with Frost Walker boots if they are pushed near water.

== Usage ==
Frosted ice behaves in most ways like [[ice]]: it is slightly slippery, causing entities to slide, including items.

Frosted ice naturally melts fairly quickly. The block is created with an age of 0, and is [[tick]]ed every 1–2 seconds. If a {{frac|1|3}} chance succeeds or the block has fewer than 4 frosted ice blocks in the 6 blocks surrounding it, and the [[internal light level]] at the block would be greater than 11 minus the age, then the age is incremented. When the age reaches 4, the block turns into water and all adjacent blocks have their age incremented (but if these blocks melt also, the effect does not continue to cascade). This does mean that in places with low light levels, such as underground, at night or in [[the End]], it never melts unless broken with few enough frosted ice blocks surrounding it.

The melting speed of frosted ice is affected by the <code>randomTickSpeed</code> [[game rule]]: setting the value to <code>0</code> results in frosted ice not melting at all, while setting it to higher than default increases the melting speed.

When a frosted ice block melts or is broken, any adjacent frosted ice block immediately melts if it has fewer than 2 frosted ice blocks remaining in the 6 blocks surrounding it.

[[Sugar cane]] and other [[crops]] do not break when frosted ice is formed, and frosted ice does not form on water occupied by another entity.
