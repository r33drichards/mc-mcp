A '''cornflower''' is a [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[blue dye]] and [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A cornflower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A cornflower also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Cornflowers generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], [[flower forest]], and [[meadow]] biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features. {{IN|java}}, they are also technically capable of growing in [[dripstone caves]] and [[deep dark]] biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, cornflowers only generate as part of [[Flower#Flower gradients|gradients]]. 

Natural cornflowers are also found in plains [[villages]].

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

==== {{JE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, cornflowers have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, cornflowers can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, cornflowers cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

==== {{BE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, cornflowers have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, cornflowers can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, cornflowers cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to a cornflower that has been placed on top of a grass block in any biome, more cornflowers appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|Java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up cornflowers, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell a cornflower for 1 emerald.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, cornflowers can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Cornflowers can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a cornflower imparts the [[Jump Boost]] effect for 5 seconds. It can be crafted using a cornflower or produced by feeding a cornflower to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with cornflowers, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Cornflowers can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a cornflower have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a cornflower into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of cornflowers yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
