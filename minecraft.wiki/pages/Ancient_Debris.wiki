'''Ancient debris''' is a rare [[ore]] found in [[the Nether]], and is the main source of [[netherite scrap]]s, which can then be used to craft [[netherite ingot]]s. Its high blast resistance makes it immune to normal [[explosion]]s. In item form, it floats on lava and is completely immune to any form of [[fire]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Ancient debris drops itself if mined by a [[diamond pickaxe]] or [[Netherite Pickaxe|netherite pickaxe]]. If mined by any other tool, it drops nothing.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Ancient Debris|pickaxe|diamond}}

=== Natural generation ===
Ancient debris generates in [[the Nether]] in the form of [[ore (feature)|scatter ore]]s which are never naturally exposed to [[air]].<ref group=note>The generation system explicitly attempts to place ancient debris where it is not exposed to air. Rarely, ancient debris can be exposed by later generation processes. It can also be exposed to fungi, or alongside smaller pockets of [[lava]].</ref> They can only replace [[netherrack]], [[basalt]]{{only|je}}, and [[blackstone]]{{only|je}}.

On average, Y-level 16 has the most ancient debris.<!-- Both versions-->

Generation of ancient debris varies by edition.
* {{IN|java}}, up to two clusters may generate per chunk:
** One cluster of 0–3 ancient debris attempts to generate with a triangle distribution from levels 8 to 24.
** An additional cluster of 0–2 ancient debris attempts to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119.
<!--Due to how ore generates, it may "bleed" out of these ranges or into different chunks-->
* {{IN|bedrock}}, up to five clusters may generate per chunk:
** Two clusters of 0–3 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 23.
** An additional three clusters of 0–2 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119.
<!--Due to how ore generates, it may "bleed" out of these ranges or into different chunks-->

{{IN|Java}}, there is an average of 1.65 ancient debris blocks per chunk{{needs testing}}, with a normal maximum of 5.<ref group="note">However, it is technically possible for up to 11 ancient debris to be found in a single chunk; adjacent chunks can generate blobs on the border with up to 2 blocks spawning in an adjacent chunk.</ref> As of Java Edition 1.16.5, on average they generate 1.56 ores per chunk. Given this number, and that there are 32768 blocks in a chunk (16×128×16), there is approximately a 0.004% chance that any randomly selected block will be an ancient debris block.

=== Generated loot ===
Ancient debris can appear in [[bastion]] chests, either as a singular item or as a stack of two items. These two options are rolled separately from each other.

== Usage ==
=== Smelting ingredient ===
Ancient debris can be smelted using a [[furnace]] or [[blast furnace]], which gives the player [[netherite scrap]]. If a player takes out the netherite scrap, they are rewarded with 2 [[experience]] points.

=== Redstone component ===
Because of its unique combination of being both blast resistant enough to withstand [[TNT]] and being movable with a [[piston]], ancient debris is sometimes used as a [[redstone component]], usually in tunnel bores.

== Trivia ==
* The texture of the ancient debris is supposed to look like pressed metal plates.<ref>{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1238025613123956737|ok so the ancient debris is supposed to be packed metal plates in a block|March 12, 2020}}</ref>
* Ancient debris is actually what remains of the mining activity of the [[piglin]]s, who extracted all the original netherite ore.<ref>

* It is possible to find blobs of up to 20 contiguous ancient debris - up to five debris can generate in a chunk, so if a blob of five generates in adjacent corners of four different chunks, a blob of 20 debris would be created.
