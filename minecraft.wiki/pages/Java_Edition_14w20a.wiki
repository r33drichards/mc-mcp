'''14w20a''' is the twenty-third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on May 15, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425132002/https://mojang.com/2014/05/minecraft-snapshot-14w20a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w20b|date=May 15, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> which adds the {{cmd|title}} command.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|title}}'''
* Can make text display on a players screen in the form of a title and/or subtitle.
** {{cmd|title <player> times <fadeIn> <stay> <fadeOut>}}
*** Set the fade in time, the stay on screen time and the fade out time for the title.
** {{cmd|title <player> title <raw json message>}}
*** Set and start showing the title.
** {{cmd|title <player> subtitle <raw json message>}}
*** Set and start the subtitle.
** {{cmd|title <player> clear}}
*** Clear titles immediately.
** {{cmd|title <player> reset}}
*** Reset all title parameters to defaults (fade times).

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added the following splashes:
** "Run, coward! I hunger!"
** "Blue warrior shot the food!"
** "Warning! A huge battleship "STEVE" is approaching fast!"
** "Rise from your grave!"

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* Blocks no longer have bits for metadata, the freed up bits are now used for block ids (dynamically).

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Slime]]s'''
* "Slime sizing was moved to a post-spawn method, so the slime's canSpawn() method would report spawnability based on the initial size, not the final size. There is an added secondary check which fixes the issue."<ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|467014008986664960|Slime sizing was moved to a post-spawn method, so the slime's canSpawn() method would report spawnability|May 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|467014110522376193|based on the initial size, not the final size. I added a secondary check which fixes the issue.|May 15, 2014}}</ref>

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cavern]]s'''
* Now generate on the surface of desert, mesa, mega taiga and mushroom [[biome]]s.

'''[[World border]]'''
* If a player is stuck outside the world border, it is possible for them to freely fly/walk around (not possible to freely walk through the border).

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|tellraw}}'''
* Now has a <code>selector</code> argument.
** Allows to print player's names.
** Example: <code>/tellraw @a {selector:"@a[team=TeamRed]"}</code> prints everyone who is on TeamRed.
** Also works with {{cmd|title}}.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Spectator]] mode'''
* Adjusting fly speed in Spectator mode now works vertically too.

'''Player list'''
* Made tab-list more consistent and a little prettier when using health display objective.
* Now groups together teams.
* Now sorts players by name.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* The 'Towards Positive/Negative X/Z' was re-added.

== Trivia ==
* 14w20a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* "Warning! A huge battleship "STEVE" is approaching fast!" is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Darius (series)|Darius]], a series of games with the same sentence, showing before boss fights.
