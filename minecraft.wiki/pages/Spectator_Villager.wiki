A '''spectator villager''' is a modified [[villager]] that  remains stationary. They are found in the [[warden arena]] where they appear as the audience of the [[Warden (April Fools' joke)|warden boss]] fight. It was introduced in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Spawning ==
Spectator villagers spawn naturally in warden arenas that generate in [[Mine (dimension)|mines]] crafted with the [[Mine Ingredient#Special Events|Warden Boss Fight ingredient]] or [[special mine|Warden special mines]] that appears as every fifth mine. The structures generate near the player's spawn point on the generated world.

== Drops ==
A spectator villager does not drop any [[item]]s or [[experience]] when killed.

== Behavior ==
The mob is permanently idle. It spectates the warden boss fight and makes comments throughout the encounter. It is immune to all forms of damage from [[Survival]] players but can be killed by a [[Creative]] player. It does not fall if the block beneath it was destroyed.

While in the arena, spectator villagers make sounds such as starting calls or cheers as they observe the player’s encounter with the warden after it has been awakened. They cheer again when the player defeats the warden.

Spectator villagers struck by lightning will become [[Spectator Witch|witches]].
