'''The Monster in the Woods''' is a crossover between ''[[Villager News]]'' and ''[[Minecraft]]'', featured during [[Minecraft Live 2024]]. The video concerns a conflict where several [[villager]]s investigate a [[creaking]]. 

== Summary ==
<onlyinclude>The short opens much like a traditional episode of the show, with [[villager]]s mumbling a theme song while holding up [[sign]]s. [[Villager No. 5]] appears, explaining the interruption as a warning for a "[[Creaking|monster]] sighting." Switching over to [[Villager No. 9]], several villagers of different professions have united to investigate claims by [[Villager No. 15]] of a creature lurking in the woods, which they accuse him of lying about and tease over. In an effort to debunk his fears, the mob of [[villager]]s plan on investigating the forest, but are quickly stopped by a [[witch]]. Emerging from a [[Swamp Hut|hut]], she warns that none have "those who enter there ''never'' return here," quickly clarifying that this means the path is just the entrance and there's a separate exit.

The villagers make their way into the forest, Villager No. 9 requesting the others keep an eye out for "monsters." He remarks "of course, we know there's no such thing," only for the others to start bringing up established ''Minecraft'' characters they consider monsters, such as [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[hoglin]]s, and [[Steve]], which Villager No. 15 asserts look nothing like what he saw. When asked what it looks like, he says it was behind a [[Pale oak|tree]]. Villager No. 31 asks if anyone else feels like they're being watched, and vanishes when they're not looking, which Villager No. 9 doesn't believe in spite of their [[drops]] being clearly present. The other villagers agree with the skepticism and move on.

As the others carry forward, they come to the conclusion there is nothing in the woods, and pledge to make their way back home. However, they realize they are now lost in the forest, and seek Villager No. 47 for help, only to realize he's suffered a similar fate to No. 31. They hear the creaking creak nearby, as more villagers perish one by one, No. 9 acting oblivious to the very real danger before running away "for unrelated reasons." The camera is dropped on the floor, as the cameraman happens upon the creaking behind a tree and dies. Back in the studio, Villager No. 5 shows concern for No. 9, begging for a response from him, as the creaking pushes forward.</onlyinclude>

Breaking news!

There's been a monster sighting.

Here's villager #9.


Thanks #5.

Villager #15 here says there's a monstrous creature right there in those woods.

So, #15, have you ever lied on the news before?

What?

I'm not lying.

I was with my group when the monster- it got all of them!

They're all gone.

Maybe they just don't like you, you know, because of all the lies.

What?

That's ridiculous--

All right.

To put an end to these clear fabrications, i'm going to go into the spooky forest and prove there's no monster.


All right, let's go.

Oh, you're heading into the woods?

Very well.

But I must warn you.

Those who enter there never return here.

[EVIL LAUGHING]

What?

Why not?

No, this is just the entrance, darling.

The exit's over there.


[SPOOKY MUSIC]

All right, come on.

Everybody keep their eyes peeled for monsters.

Of course, we know there's no such thing.

What about zombies?

Skeletons?

[ALL TALKING]

It didn't look like any of those.

All right.

What did it look like?

Uh, I couldn't see it clearly.

It was behind a tree.

Convenient.


Hey, wait.

Does anyone feel like we're being watched?

I hope so.

We need the ratings.

[RUMBLING]

Did anybody hear that?

Hear what?

The creaking.

I'd say it was more of a crunching.

Hey, wait.

Where's villager #31?

Is that XP?

Ah, the monster got him!

[ALL CLAMORING]

No, no.

That could have been anybody's XP, and emeralds, and sign that says I'm villager #31, help me.

I'm being attacked by a monster.

It's circumstantial at best.

Let's move on.

Yeah, that does make sense.

All right, well, I'm convinced.

Let's keep going.


I thought he said there were monsters.

Yeah.

All right.

We've been here for a while and we haven't seen any monsters.

Yeah, we should make our way back.

Which way was that again?

Oh, no, we're lost.

What?

No.

Does anyone know the way back?

Villager #47 will know.

He's a cartographer.

Where's villager #47?

Hey, someone left a map and all this XP.

Maybe there is a monster.

There's no monster.

Who said that?

[ALL SCREAMING]

It's going to get to us.

Villager #5, it appears that a wave of hysteria

has afflicted the group.

Stunned by the notion that there are no monsters in the woods.

The cameraman and I are going to run away now

for unrelated reasons.

Goodbye.

Hey, what's behind that tree?

[SCREAMING]


Oh, no, Villager #9.

Villager #9, are you there?

Is anybody there?

[CREAKING]

[TONE BEEPING]

I guess we'll never know what caused

this tragic chain of events, but it definitely wasn't a monster.


Breaking news!

A new mob has been announced at Minecraft Live!

It's some kind of monster.

Wait... what?


Villager #9 here.

Sorry for interrupting the news, but villager #15

and I have just escaped from the spooky forest.

And I'd just like to state, like I said earlier, that I was right.

There is, in fact, a monster in the woods that looks like wood and sounds like wood.

What?

That's a lie.

You didn't believe that at all.

He didn't believe me.

But in my heroic foray into the spooky forest, I, Villager #9, single handedly discovered the creature that i shall now name, The Crunching.

It's called a Creaking.

They literally just said its name.

Maybe I should go into monster hunting.

I'm clearly very good at it.

Villager #9, monster hunter.

It's got a nice ring to it.

Well, sorry to interrupt the show again.

Now back to you in the studio.


Uh, it seems we're having some technical difficulties.

In other news, there's a dangerous new mob lurking out there in the wilderness!

If you're ever out in the woods and you see this horrible, grotesque creature never turn your back on it!

Unless there's two of them, and one's behind you.

Then, uh, good luck!

Wouldn't wanna be that person...

Well, goodbye!
