This page documents all known cases where [[missing textures and models]] are or were used in vanilla [[Bedrock Edition]].

For this page, due to the nature and intended use of missing textures and missing models, "vanilla" is defined in a much more strict sense than normal: alongside having no mods installed, use of non-default [[texture pack]]s or [[resource pack]]s, as well as non-default [[behavior pack]]s, are also forbidden, as these can allow for the arbitrary occurrence of error handling assets. Unassigned block IDs, as well as experimental and Education Edition features with the associated world options disabled, are also not accepted.
