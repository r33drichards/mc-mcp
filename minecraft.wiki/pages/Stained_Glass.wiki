'''Stained glass''' is a [[dye]]d variant of the [[glass]] block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Stained glass drops itself only if it is broken with a [[tool]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. Otherwise, it drops nothing.

Stained glass does not have an assigned tool; it is mined at the same speed regardless of what tool is used.<ref>{{bug|MC-179316||Glass blocks do not have an assigned tool}}</ref>

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Stained Glass|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Magenta stained glass blocks naturally generate as windows in [[end cities]] and [[End City#End ship|end ship]]s.
[[File:End City Glass2.png|thumb|Magenta stained glass naturally generating in an end city.]]
Brown stained glass can generate in [[trail ruins]].

Black, light gray, and white stained glass can generate inside [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
Stained glass blocks adjacent to other glass blocks are invisible when viewed through glass that is identical in color.

Mobs cannot normally spawn on stained glass blocks. An exception to this is [[Zombie#Reinforcements|zombie reinforcements]], which can spawn on stained glass blocks (but not [[stained glass pane]]s).

Stained glass blocks cannot be seen through by mobs, as they treat them as completely opaque. Mobs may look at players through stained glass, but this is purely visual.

[[Redstone dust]] and components can be placed on stained glass, but cannot power stained glass. Stained glass can't cut vertical redstone. Vertical redstone can be placed on stained glass. {{IN|java}}, it transmits redstone signals up, not down. Otherwise, stained glass in redstone circuits is functionally the same as an upside-down slab.

=== Beacon beam color ===
The color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of stained glass (or [[stained glass pane]]s) anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as [[Dye#Color values|those for the corresponding dye]]. This also works using [[hardened stained glass]] and [[hardened stained glass pane]]s.{{only|bedrock|education}} Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.

The resulting beam color can be found as <math>C = \frac{1}{2^{n}}\left(c_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n{2^{i-1}c_i}\right)</math>where <math>c_i</math> is the sequence of glass colors (<math>c_0</math> corresponds to the lowest block and <math>c_n</math> to the highest one).

As the blending algorithm is considerably simpler than that of [[Dye#Dyeing armor|leather-dyeing]], a much larger part of the sRGB space is available.{{Info needed|Needs rewording to clarify the relationship between the blending algorithm and the resulting color space.}} A player may experiment with stacking glass, although programs that calculate combinations are also available.<ref>https://minecraft.tools/en/beacon-color.php</ref>

All colors can be made from 15 types of stained glass. For example, red + white stained glass above a beacon creates a shade of pink depending on the quantity of white.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Prior to the addition of stained glass to the game, there was a similar block named ''tinted glass'' added to the hoax version [[Java Edition 2.0]]. The texture for this ''tinted glass'' block was used for the implementation of stained glass in [[Java Edition 13w41a|13w41a]] before it was replaced with a smoother/transparent texture in [[Java Edition 13w42a|13w42a]]. The iteration of ''tinted glass'' from Java Edition 2.0 shares its name with the [[Tinted Glass|tinted glass]] block added in [[Java Edition 1.17|1.17]].
