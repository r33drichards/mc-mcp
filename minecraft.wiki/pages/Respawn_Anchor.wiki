The '''respawn anchor''' is a [[block]] that allows the [[player]] to set their [[spawn point]] in [[the Nether]]. It will only work if fueled using [[glowstone]] blocks.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break a respawn anchor is a [[pickaxe]]. A respawn anchor needs to be broken using a [[diamond pickaxe]] or better, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.

A respawn anchor drops itself when destroyed, But resets glowstone charges back to 0 when broken.

=== Crafting ===
While the ingredients to craft a respawn anchor are all native to the Nether, they are also obtainable in the Overworld: [[glowstone]] can be obtained from [[trading]] with [[villager]]s or [[wandering trader]]s, or crafted from [[glowstone dust]] dropped by [[witch]]es; crying obsidian can be found in [[ruined portal]]s.

== Usage ==
Like [[obsidian]] and [[crying obsidian]], the respawn anchor can't be destroyed by the [[ender dragon]].

=== Respawning ===
[[File:Respawn anchor logic3.png|alt=|thumb|308x308px|Tile priority in where the anchor looks to respawn the player (with 1 being the highest). The minimum area required to be valid is 1×2×1. Respawn attempts are made per column for layer1 and layer2, layer3 is used when attempts for all columns fail for layer1 and layer2; e.g. column1-layer2 has priority over column2-layer1, and column8-layer1 has priority over column1-layer3.]]
The respawn anchor is used to respawn in the Nether, even if the player leaves the Nether. Once the block is charged, it can be {{control|used}} to set the player's respawn location.

;Charging
When crafted, a respawn anchor has no (zero) charge and can't yet be used until charged. ''{{Control|Using}}'' a [[glowstone]] block (not [[glowstone dust]]) on it adds a charge. The anchor accepts up to 4 charges, and the charge level is indicated by a dial on the side of the block.

The first charge makes the respawn anchor glow with a light level of 3. Each glowstone after the first increases the light level by 4, up to a maximum of 15.

;Setting respawn
To set the player's spawn location to the respawn anchor they must {{control|use}} it, just like one does with a bed. The anchor must at least have one charge, and it must be in the Nether. A confirmation appears when the player's respawn location is set. Other players can also set their spawn point to the same respawn anchor. Each respawn uses up one charge, even if used by another player.

Using a charged anchor overrides any other spawn location the player might have had, as with a bed. The respawn anchor does not serve as a backup spawn point to a missing or obstructed bed.

;Respawn upon player death
Upon death, the player respawns next to the anchor, and it loses one charge. If a player's respawn anchor is destroyed, if its charges have been exhausted, or if the area around it is made unsuitable for respawning, a message appears saying "You have no home bed or charged Respawn Anchor, or it was obstructed", and the player respawns at the world spawn point. Returning through an [[End Portal (block)|End portal]] is not considered a respawn, and does not use any charges.

A respawn anchor can be shared among several players. When shared, remaining charges are shared as well.
In [[Hardcore]] mode, the respawn anchor does not resurrect the player, but may still teleport them and consume charges.

=== Exploding ===
If the player attempts to set their [[World spawn#Individual spawn|spawn]] at a charged respawn anchor in the [[Overworld]], [[the End]], or [[custom dimension]]s in which they are disabled, the block [[explode]]s (and is destroyed) similar to when a [[bed]] is used in the Nether or the End. The explosion has a power of 5 and sets fire to surrounding blocks.

Upon death from a respawn anchor explosion, the [[death messages|message]] "'''(Player) was killed by <span class="minetip" title=MCPE-28723>{{bug|MCPE-28723|[Intentional Game Design]}}</span>'''" appears. {{IN|bedrock}}, respawn anchor explosions can be disabled by setting the [[Game rule|gamerule]] <code>respawnBlocksExplode</code> to <code>false</code> which can be done with the following command: {{cmd|gamerule respawnBlocksExplode}}; this still does not permit respawn anchors to be used in invalid dimensions.

=== Redstone component ===
When charged, a [[redstone comparator]] gives a signal depending on the number of charges: 3 for one charge, 7 for two charges, 11 for three charges, 15 for four charges. An empty anchor gives a signal of 0.

The respawn anchor can also be charged with a [[dispenser]] containing glowstone.

=== Hoglins ===
[[Hoglin]]s run away from respawn anchors, regardless of charge.

=== Note blocks ===
Respawn anchors can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce the "bass drum" sound.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Respawn anchors cannot be pushed or pulled by [[piston]]s or [[sticky piston]]s.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The [[:File:On Respawn Anchor (top texture) JE1 BE1.png|active respawn anchor's top texture]] is actually translucent, as this texture is a direct modification of the [[Nether portal block]] texture. This translucency is not visible in-game as solid blocks with transparent pixels are always rendered as opaque.
* The respawn anchor's ambient sound is in fact the nether portal's ambient sound played backward.
