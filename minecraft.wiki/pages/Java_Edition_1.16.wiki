'''1.16''', the release of the '''[[Nether Update]]''', is a major update to {{Editions|je}} announced at [[MINECON Live 2019]]<ref name="MINECON article">{{Mcnet|everything-we-announced-minecon-live-2019|Everything We Announced at MINECON Live 2019|September 28, 2019}}</ref> and released on June 23, 2020.<ref name=nether-release>{{Mcnet|nether-update-java|Nether Update out today on Java!|June 23, 2020}}</ref> This update overhauls [[the Nether]] by adding four new biomes, four new mobs (the [[piglin]], [[hoglin]], [[zoglin]], and [[strider]]), and a multitude of new blocks, including many variants of [[blackstone]] as well as the [[respawn anchor]] used to set the player's spawnpoint in the Nether. It also adds a new [[netherite]] tier of equipment, obtained through [[ancient debris]] found rarely throughout the Nether.

1.16 was reuploaded around 6 hours after release to attempt to fix an issue with the Realms menu which prevented clients from viewing and connecting to Realms ({{bug|MC-191138}}). The changes were only to the client, and the server jar files are functionally identical.<ref>{{reddit|hee603||Welcome to the Nether - Minecraft Java Edition 1.16 has been released|author=sliced_lime|date=June 23, 2020}}</ref> This hotfix was unsuccessful,<ref>{{bug|MC-191138}}</ref> and [[Java Edition 1.16.1|1.16.1]] was released the next day.

* [[Shearing]] sound category was changed from "friendly creatures" to "[[player]]s" for players using [[shears]] and to "[[block]]s" for [[dispenser]]s using shears.

'''[[World Spawn|Spawn]]'''
* [[Player]]s can reset their spawn point using a [[bed]] when hostile [[mob]]s are near, although players still cannot sleep when hostile mobs are near.

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Changed the subtitle for [[zombified piglin]]s angry grunts from "Zombified Piglin angers" to "Zombified Piglin grunts angrily".
* Changed the subtitle for [[zombie villager]]s converting from "Zombie vociferates" to "Zombie Villager vociferates".

** Shearing [[sheep]] (a regression from 1.15.2).<ref>{{bug|MC-178567}}</ref>
** Feeding a brown [[mooshroom]].<ref>{{bug|MC-178618}}</ref>
** Using a spawn egg on a mob to spawn a baby variant, if there wouldn't also be a block within reach through said mob.<ref>{{bug|MC-180922}}</ref>
* Hand animations for the following have been removed:
** Targeting a block through a mob then using a [[spawn egg]].<ref>{{bug|MC-165669}}</ref>
** Attempting to switch a [[minecart with furnace]]'s direction when it isn't on a rail<ref>{{bug|MC-165734}}</ref>
** Using a [[dye]] on a [[sheep]] which already has that color.<ref>{{bug|MC-166524}}</ref>
** Using a dye on a sheared sheep.

'''[[Attributes]]'''
* Items and entities no longer keep unknown attributes.

** Changed {{cd|generic.armorToughness|d=to|generic.armor_toughness}}.

'''Block storage format'''
* Block storage format in chunks has been slightly changed to speed up various tasks (rendering, pathfinding, world generation, etc.).
** {{cd|BlockStates}} in {{cd|Sections}} elements no longer contain values stretching over multiple 64-bit fields.
*** If the number of bits per block is not a power of two (i.e. single 64-bit value can't fill whole number of blockstates) some bits are not used.
*** For example, if a single block state takes 5 bits, the highest 4 bits of every 64-bit field are unused. That also means a slight increase in storage size (in case of 5 bits, from 320 to 342 64-bit fields).

'''Chat'''
* Changed the capitalization of "Click to copy to Clipboard" to "Click to Copy to Clipboard".
* Changed "Your home bed was missing or obstructed" to "You have no home bed or charged respawn anchor, or it was obstructed".

* If data pack reload fails, changes are not applied and the game continues using previous data.
* Changes to data pack list are stored only after successful reload.
* If existing data packs prevent world from loading, the game gives option to load world in safe mode, which loads only vanilla data pack.
* Added <code>--safeMode</code> option for servers to load only with vanilla data pack.
* Game detects any critical data pack issues, such as required tags being missing, and prevents the world from being loaded.
* Entering the world in an unknown dimension (caused by disabling a [[data pack]] which added said [[dimension]]) now puts the player in the [[Overworld]] at the same coordinates.

'''[[Debug menu]]'''
* When outside the world's vertical area, the debug menu no longer lists 'minecraft:the_void' as the biome.
** Instead, it simply hides the biome information.

'''[[Wikipedia:Floating-point arithmetic|Floating-point]] precision'''
[[File:Bone meal precision loss.png|thumb|right|Bone meal particles being generated at the corner of the block instead of at the sapling, one of many precision loss bugs fixed by 1.16.]]
* Certain game mechanics, mainly a handful of different particles, have been modified to use 64-bit ([[wikipedia:Double-precision floating-point format|double-precision]]) precision where they previously used 32-bit ([[wikipedia:Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]]).
* As a result, the effects appear in the correct places even if the player is far away from the spawn point (with effects being the most extreme when over 16,777,216 blocks away). See [[Java Edition distance effects]] for a further explanation and history of such effects.
* The following precision loss errors are fixed:
** [[Bone meal]] particles should now appear at the right position.<ref>{{bug|MC-76810}}</ref>
** [[Lava]] embers and popping sounds should now originate from the correct positions.<ref>{{bug|MC-167046}}</ref>
** [[Campfire]] embers should now be generated at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-167042}}</ref>
** Particles from [[redstone repeater]]s should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-167971}}</ref>
** Particles from Nether biomes should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-170872}}</ref>
** Particles from adding [[eye of ender]]s to [[end portal frame]]s should now appear at the correct position.<ref>{{bug|MC-161969}}</ref>
** Particles dripping from [[leaves]] during rain no longer snap to block corners and are correctly randomized across the underside of the block.<ref>{{bug|MC-167091}}</ref>
** The book of the [[enchanting table]] now opens properly at high distances; previously there were cases where the player could be pressed right up to the block, yet the book would not acknowledge them.<ref>{{bug|MC-167044}}</ref>
** [[TNT]] ignited by other explosions now appears at the right locations at high distances.<ref>{{bug|MC-166047}}</ref>
** [[Detector rail]]s at high distances were not always being correctly powered and depowered, which has been fixed.<ref>{{bug|MC-183174}}</ref>
** Mob spawning would also break down, spawning mobs at block corners and sometimes inside of other blocks.<ref>{{bug|MC-167103}}</ref>
** Generation of [[minecarts with chest]]s in [[mineshaft]]s now spawns them at the intended positions.<ref>{{bug|MC-167421}}</ref>.

'''Fonts'''
* Chat component style now supports {{cd|font}} property, which is resource location for font in the resource pack. No entry is equivalent to {{cd|minecraft:default}}.
* Full range of Unicode characters is supported, making it possible to type emojis and other Unicode characters outside of the [[wikipedia:Plane (Unicode)#Basic Multilingual Plane|Basic Multilingual Plane]].
** However, custom resource packs must be used to display correct characters instead of tofu, due to the lack of these characters in the default font.
* {{cd|Force Unicode}} option now switches between normal and alternative font (called {{cd|uniform.json}}) – no reload needed.
* Many new characters have been added.
** Includes several remaining Latin and Armenian-language ligatures<ref>{{bug|MC-156442}}</ref> and the Georgian alphabet.
** The new characters are: <span style="word-break:break-all;">´¨ᴀʙᴄᴅᴇꜰɢʜᴊᴋʟᴍɴᴏᴘꞯʀꜱᴛᴜᴠᴡʏᴢ§ɱɳɲʈɖɡʡɕʑɸʝʢɻʁɦʋɰɬɮʘǀǃǂǁɓɗᶑʄɠʛɧɫɨʉʊɘɵɤɜɞɑɒɚɝƁƉƑƩƲႠႡႢႣႤႥႦႧႨႩႪႫႬႭႮႯႰႱႲႳႴႵႶႷႸႹႺႻႼႽႾႿჀჁჂჃჄჅჇჍაბგდევზთიკლმნოპჟრსტუფქღყშჩცძწჭხჯჰჱჲჳჴჵჶჷჸჹჺ჻ჼჽჾჿתּשׂפֿפּכּײַיִוֹוּבֿבּꜧꜦɺⱱʠʗʖɭɷɿʅʆʓʚ₪₾֊ⴀⴁⴂⴃⴄⴅⴆⴡⴇⴈⴉⴊⴋⴌⴢⴍⴎⴏⴐⴑⴒⴣⴓⴔⴕⴖⴗⴘⴙⴚⴛⴜⴝⴞⴤⴟⴠⴥ⅛⅜⅝⅞⅓⅔✉☂☔☄⛄☃⌛⌚⚐✎❣♤♧♡♢⛈☰☱☳☴☶☷↔⇒⇏⇔⇵∀∃∄∉∋∌⊂⊃⊄⊅∧∨⊻⊼⊽∥≢⋆∑⊤⊥⊢⊨≔∁∴∵∛∜∂⋃⊆⊇□△▷▽◁◆◇○◎☆★✘₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉₊₋₌₍₎∫∮∝⌀⌂⌘〒ɼƄƅẟȽƚƛȠƞƟƧƨƪƸƹƻƼƽƾȡȴȵȶȺⱥȻȼɆɇȾⱦɁɂɃɄɈɉɊɋɌɍɎɏẜẝỼỽỾỿꞨꞩ𐌰𐌱𐌲𐌳𐌴𐌵𐌶𐌷𐌸𐌹𐌺𐌻𐌼𐌽𐌾𐌿𐍀𐍁𐍂𐍃𐍄𐍅𐍆𐍇𐍈𐍉𐍊🌧🔥🌊</span>

'''Hitboxes'''
* Fire now has a hitbox, unlike previously, where it did not, when putting out fire required targeting its base blocks.
* Redstone dust's hitbox now correctly confirms to its shape, much like the hitboxes of [[fence]]s, [[wall]]s, [[glass pane]]s, and [[iron bars]].
** This also includes when the redstone is traveling up a vertical surface, so the upward portion can be targeted without hitting the block underlying.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Entity predicate
** Added {{cd|fishing_hook}} sub-predicate.
* {{cd|fishing_hook}}
** Check properties of the fishing hook.
** {{cd|in_open_water}} parameter matches whether the fishing location is open water fishing or not.
** Can be set to "false" in-game files to make AFK fishing farms work again. This removes the restriction of being able to obtain loot only from normal waters.

'''[[Main menu]]'''

** Uses default properties.
* Whether or not a block requires a tool is now no longer a property of a material and is now assigned on a block-by-block basis.

[[File:Splash2020.png|thumb|New Mojang Studios logo on the loading screen.]]
'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Updated [[Mojang Studios]] and ''[[Minecraft]]'' logos.

'''Miscellaneous'''

During online play, you may be exposed to unmoderated chat messages or other types of user-generated content that may not be suitable for everyone."

'''[[NBT tag]]s'''
* The <code>Dimension</code> [[NBT tag]] is now a [[resource location]] string instead of a number, which is used in [[player.dat]].

'''[[Obsidian platform]]'''
* Obsidian platform now can get regenerated when a non-player entity enters the End through an [[end portal]].

'''Optimizing worlds'''
* The progress bar when optimizing worlds are now color-coded according to the type of [[dimension]], and the ratio is calculated according to the number of chunks to optimize for each.
** Green for the [[Overworld]], brown for [[the Nether]], and light orange for [[the End]].
** This applies even with custom dimensions.

'''Options'''
* The localization key for the offhand keybinding was changed from <code>key.swapHands</code> to <code>key.swapOffhand</code>.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* [[File:Glint.png|32px]] [[Bone meal]] particles
** Now use 64-bit floats for spawning, not 32-bit.
*** This means that using bone meal at high distances from the world origin (notably greater than 17 million) causes the particles to appear in expected places, and not far away from the target.

'''Pathfinding'''
* Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Top-level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents are <code>AND</code>ed).

** For {{cd|show_entity}} – object with fields: {{cd|id}} (UUID), {{cd|name}} (chat component) and {{cd|type}} (entity type resource location)
** The <code>value</code> argument is now deprecated, but still supported.

'''[[Realms]]'''
* Removed translation strings of:
** {{cd|mco.create.world.seed}}.
** {{cd|mco.trial.title}}.

'''Rendering'''
* Improved entity shadows to the ground.
* Made experimental changes to graphics rendering.
* Added shader support for accessing the depth buffer.
* The renderer now uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements.

'''[[Saved hotbar|Saved toolbars]]'''
* Renamed to "Saved Hotbars"

'''Servers'''
* Added a {{cd|enable-status}} option to the [[server.properties]] file which if set to {{cd|false}} suppresses replies to status requests from clients.
** This makes the server appear offline in the multiplayer screen.
* Added control over how much entity data a server sends to clients: {{cd|entity-broadcast-range-percentage}} server property, controlling how close entities need to be before being sent to clients.
** Higher values mean entities are visible further away from players but cause more network traffic.
** Specifies a percentage of the default value so, for example, {{cd|50}} specifies half of the default range.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added crimson and warped wooden [[item]]s to the {{cd|planks|standing_signs|wall_signs|wooden_buttons|wooden_doors|wooden_fences|wooden_pressure_plates|wooden_slabs|wooden_stairs|wooden_trapdoors|d=and}} block tags.
* Added crimson and warped wooden items to the {{cd|planks|signs|wooden_buttons|wooden_doors|wooden_fences|wooden_pressure_plates|wooden_slabs|wooden_stairs|wooden_trapdoors|d=and}} item tags.

** Added [[Nether fungi]], [[nylium]] variants, [[crimson roots]], and [[warped roots]].
** Removed [[netherrack]] variant.
* The {{cd|slabs}} block and item tags now use the respective {{cd|wooden_slabs}} tag.
* Changed the {{cd|logs}} block and item tags to use the {{cd|logs_that_burn|crimson_stems|warped_stems|d=and}} block and item tags, respectively.
* Changed the {{cd|music_discs}} item tag to use the {{cd|creeper_drop_music_discs}} item tag and the Pigstep music disc.
* Changed the {{cd|stairs}} block and item tags to use their respective {{cd|wooden_stairs}} tag.
** This has effectively made [[crimson stairs]] and [[warped stairs]] a part of this tag.
* The <code>sand</code> block tag is now used to determine whether turtle eggs can hatch on a block.

'''[[The Nether]]'''
* Changed the ambient lighting in the Nether; it is now much darker.

'''UUIDs'''
* UUIDs stored in NBT are also represented as an array of four integers, rather than <code>UUIDMost</code>/<code>UUIDLeast</code>.
** Example: <code>{UUID:[I;1498693494,1027158888,1898994005,860320107]}</code>
** Renamed a couple of fields:
*** {{cd|OwnerUUID}} of tamed animals, area effect clouds, evoker fangs and projectiles is now simply {{cd|Owner}}.
*** {{cd|TrustedUUIDs}} of foxes is now {{cd|Trusted}}.

** Dedicated servers can disable that by changing sync-chunk-writes inside {{mono|[[server.properties]]}}.

'''World save format'''
* Saving {{cd|level.dat}} now uses randomly-named temporary files (instead of using {{cd|level.dat_new}} every time).
* {{cd|player/*.dat}} are now saved in a way similar to {{cd|level.dat}} (including leaving {{cd|.dat_old}} files).

'''World selection'''
* Changed "Failed to access level" to "Failed to access world".
