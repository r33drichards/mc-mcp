== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Ash Kapoor stood in the shadow of the castle. '''It was a cursed place,''' with dark windows and tall, twisting turrets. A flag snapped in the wind. On it was the image of some '''fearsome beast,''' the likes of which she'd never seen. A crow cawed in the distance.
''Any other kid would be afraid right now,'' Ash thought. ''But not me. I eat danger for breakfast!''
Ash had in fact eaten oatmeal for breakfast.
And she wasn't standing in front of a spooky old castle, either. It was just her new school, '''Woodsword Middle'''. But if she squinted at the building just right, she could imagine it was a '''haunted fortress,''' or a '''forgotten temple,''' or an '''alien stronghold''' on some far-off moon.|Ash's first impression of the school.}}
