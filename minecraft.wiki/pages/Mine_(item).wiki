A '''mine''' is an item that is created using a [[Mine Crafter|mine crafter]] or upon exiting a [[Mine (dimension) (April Fools' joke)|mine]] along with some [[experience]], introduced in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Obtaining ==
A mine can be created via a mine crafter. When the player completes or fails the mine they created, the mine crafter will release the mine as an item. The mine will have a green glow if it was successfully completed, and will have a red glow if it was failed.

== Usage ==

Upon crafting a mine using the mine crafter, the mine will appear in the middle of its interface, which when clicked allows the player to teleport to the mine. They can also be used on a [[mine revisitor]] in the Memory Lane of the [[hub]] to be able to revisit the archived mine.
