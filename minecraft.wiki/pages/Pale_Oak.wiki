A '''pale oak''' is a type of [[tree]] that generates in [[pale garden]]s. Naturally-generated pale oaks have a chance of containing [[creaking heart]]s in them. The trees have a similar shape to [[dark oak]].
Players can grow a pale oak by placing four [[pale oak sapling]]s in a 2×2 square; pale oaks grown from saplings never contain creaking hearts.

== Appearance ==
Pale oaks have some similarities with [[dark oak]] trees, including thick 2×2 trunks, irregular logs connected to the trunk and a similar canopy shape. However, they are grey in color and have [[Pale Hanging Moss|pale hanging moss]] attached to the canopy. Naturally generated pale oak trees sometimes have [[Creaking Heart|creaking hearts]] hidden inside.

== Generation ==
The pale oak only spawns naturally in the [[pale garden]] biome. It has a 20% chance to spawn a creaking heart. The spawn attempt fails if there is no log that is completely hidden by other logs.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of pale oak:
*{{BlockLink|Pale Oak Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
*{{BlockLink|Pale Oak Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
*{{BlockLink|Pale Hanging Moss}} (harvested with [[shears]])
*{{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
*{{BlockLink|Pale Oak Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
*{{BlockLink|Stripped Pale Oak Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
*{{BlockLink|Pale Oak Sapling}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)

=== Pale oak with creaking heart ===
*{{BlockLink|Creaking Heart}} (harvested with a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]])
*{{BlockLink|Resin Clump}} (when the creaking connected to the creaking heart is attacked)

== Planting ==
Pale oak [[sapling]]s can be planted on:
*{{BlockLink|Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Podzol}}
*{{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
*{{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Farmland}}
*{{BlockLink|Mud}}
*{{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}


Growing these trees requires four pale oak saplings arranged in a 2×2 grid; they do ''not'' grow if planted individually. They require a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). This column is centered on the northwestern sapling. Additionally, pale oak trees require a 5×5 column without obstruction for the next 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (saplings planted in a 2×2 hole 1 block deep still grow).
