'''25w19a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.6]] released on May 6, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w19a|id=a|May 6, 2025}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Projectile]]s'''
* Projectiles now have a target tolerance margin that changes over time.
** All projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight.
** After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the previous fixed 0.3 blocks margin.
** This allows for better precision close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway when the projectile is further away.

=== General ===
'''[[Attribute]]s'''
* The scale attribute for the [[happy ghast]] now has a limit of {{cd|1.0}}.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|76}}.
* {{cd|--quickPlaySingleplayer}} command line argument can now be used without an identifier to launch into the last played world.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* {{cd|tnt}}
** The entity that primed the TNT is now stored in an optional {{cd|owner}} field (UUID of Living entity).
* {{cd|vex}}
** The owner of a vex is now stored in an optional {{cd|owner}} field (UUID of Mob).

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|60}}.
* [[Panorama]] textures must now all be the same size, and square.

'''[[Shaders]]'''
* Shader fog
** The fog is now split into environmental and render-distance-based.
** Previously both those concepts were mixed in the same uniforms.
** Environmental fog is supposed to represent the "fogginess" of the environment the player is in: lava, water, and now also atmosphere.
** Render distance fog is supposed to obscure the border of visible terrain.
** Environmental fog uses spherical distance to determine its intensity, render distance fog uses cylindrical distance.
** The resulting fog value for any given vertex is the maximum of both.
* {{cd|Fog}} uniform block
** {{cd|FogStart}} was renamed to {{cd|FogRenderDistanceStart}} and now represents the render distance fog start.
** {{cd|FogEnd}} was renamed to {{cd|FogRenderDistanceEnd}} and now represents the render distance fog end.
** {{cd|FogEnvironmentalStart}} is new and represents the start of environment-based fog.
** {{cd|FogEnvironmentalEnd}} is new and represents the end of environment-based fog.
** {{cd|FogShape}} was removed. Render distance fog is now cylindrical and environmental for is spherical.

'''[[Sounds]]'''
* The sound event {{cd|block.dried_ghast.hit}} has been removed.

'''UI sprites'''
* {{code|[[mob_effects.png-atlas]]}} has been merged into {{code|[[gui.png-atlas]]}} and no longer exists.
** This means Mob Effect sprites now support GUI sprite scaling properties.
