The '''ankle monitor''' was a foot item present in the April Fools' snapshot [[1.RV-Pre1]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Mob loot ===
Zombies, zombie villagers and skeletons could spawn with an ankle monitor on their right foot. They had a chance{{More info|how big? is it affected by looting?}} to drop it when killed by the player.

== Usage ==
Ankle monitors were equipped in the boots slot. They could not be taken off in [[survival mode]], similarly to items afflicted with the yet to be added [[Curse of Binding]].

While wearing an ankle monitor during the night (between 12541 and 23458, or 18:30 and 5:30 according to the [[Smarter Watch]]), being more than 50 blocks from the player's spawn point afflicted the player with [[Slowness]] I for 14 seconds and prompted the following message in chat: "CURFEW WARNING! You are violating your house arrest! Get back by [distance] meters!" The message was displayed again and the effect was reapplied every 10 seconds until the player got back into the 50 block radius.

If in [[the Nether]] or [[the End]], the player is afflicted with [[Slowness]] I for 14 seconds and a different set of messages was cycled through, which can be seen in the section below. The effect was reapplied and the messages were displayed every 9 seconds.
