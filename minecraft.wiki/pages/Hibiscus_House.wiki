}}'''Hibiscus House''' is the name of a fortress on the [[Ever Realm]] server, inhabited by a [[The Gang|gang]] of players who frequent it.

== Location ==
The building is situated on a large hill, on the north end of four split paths decorated with lamp posts. To the south end of the intersection is a large sign, pointing towards the House, as well as three other areas, with the House's sign being noticeably carved and covered in [[vines]] and a [[lantern]].

== Architecture ==
The house is constructed out of a white inorganic material, presumably [[Block of Quartz|quartz]] or [[diorite]], in a {{Wikipedia|modern architecture}} style. From the west side, it resembles a conglomeration of six blocks, one rotated, with three balconies. Each of the three have noticeable [[Fence|railings]] and green [[banners]], with wooden beams supporting the one closest to the ground. On the top of the roofs are what appears to be moss, with [[vines]] and hanging moss growing out of the bottom side. 

== Layout ==
From the west of the building, two doors can be seen, one on the front and the other on a balcony patio. The front door leads into a room with walls made of the same material as the exterior, with magenta carpeting and an assortment of trinkets. Closest to the door is a stylized poster of a [[creeper]], as well as a second poster colored like a [[map]]. Across from there is a table, decorated with a [[diamond sword]], a water bottle, and a stack of papers. Beneath are a [[diamond pickaxe]], [[lapis ore]], a crate of [[apples]], and a carpet decorated with skulls and what appear to be [[slime]] eyes.

Above the room is a support beam, where a chicken is shown watching, and three unidentified objects built into the wall. Nearby is a set of three chests, and an armory of various gear, including a trident and diamond armor. Beside the gear are the heads of several mobs, including a creeper, [[wither skeleton]], [[ghast]], [[zombie pigman]]<!-- Not a piglin. -->, and three [[eyes of ender]]. Beneath the heads is a lavender elevation, which hosts a table and a cardboard box of what appears to be [[gold]].
