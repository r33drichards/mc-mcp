'''Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes''' is an official series with five episodes, posted on YouTube by [[Mojang Studios]] and written by [[Tom Stone]].

== Plot ==
It was a dark and stormy night, and a disgruntled ex-employee changed [[Minecraft]] forever. He used the machine Mojang Studios built that put things into Minecraft, and used it to add Mobbo, the worst [[mob]] ever conceived, and a running joke that’s really gotten out of hand, is now in Minecraft and the entire [[Overworld]] is doomed! It’s only a matter of time until the game is broken forever… That’s why Narrator and MARILLA have bravely (and contractual obligatorily) jumped into the machine and put themselves in Minecraft, so they can stop Mobbo and save the Overworld.

{{SpoilerWarning|section|Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes}}
=== Episode 1: Starting a New Adventure ===
{{yt|Rn0KNAi1BsY|align=right}}
Narrator and MARILLA enter Minecraft in a [[plains]] biome. Narrator sees a pig and stares at it for a few seconds before telling MARILLA that they might be in {{W|Forza Horizon 5}}. MARILLA corrects him that they are in Minecraft, and then lists the biomes that can be commonly found, and stating that if Mobbo was anywhere, it would probably be one of those biomes.

Narrator then states that every update, Mojang Studios must makes sure not to add any unintentional difficulty spikes to the starter biomes, and that even the slightest change in the ecosystem could lead the entire Overworld into chaos. The video shows a [[rabbit]] utilising a [[crossbow]] to attack Steve, emphasising Narrator’s point. MARILLA states that this was the reason why the [[sunflower plains]] were chosen over the ‘TNT plains’.

Narrator goes on to say that many games start the [[player]] off in a tranquil [[forest]] area, and that these areas are supposed to be welcoming so as to not overwhelm neophytes. MARILLA adds that adding more challenging areas later on gives a game a good sense of escalation.

According to MARILLA, Mojang starts you off in forests and greenery to trick players into thinking Minecraft ‘isn’t a jerk’. Then the biomes steadily get more sinister, until players are ‘burning in [[the Nether]]’ and ‘ending in [[the End]]'.

Narrator states that Minecraft is unique because it doesn’t force players to visit the harder levels. Some players have never seen the Nether or the End, in fact. MARILLA states that the developers who worked on [[the Nether Update]] totally did not cry when she told them how many players actually visited the Nether.

Narrator states that Minecraft has more subtle ways to make you visit new biomes. For example, the plains may have many animals and land to build on, but if players want the wood to build useful tools, they will have to visit a biome with more [[tree]]s. And if one visits the [[dark forest]] biome, they will soon find out that hostile mobs love spawning there 24/7. According to Narrator, this is Mojang's passive-aggressive way to force players to flee a biome and explore new ones.

Narrator tells MARILLA that Mobbo does not appear to be in any of the starter biomes, and MARILLA says that maybe it is currently ruining some other biome. Narrator prefers to assume that Mobbo is gone forever and that they won.

MARILLA suggests celebrating defeating Mobbo with a meal at a new restaurant. Narrator asks MARILLA what she means by that, before realising that in front of them is a Mobbo-head shaped restaurant called ‘[[Mobbo's|MOBBO’S A REAL RESTAURANT]]’. Narrators asks when it opened and tries to confirm whether it is a trap, but MARILLA just says that he asks too many questions.

The screen cuts to a ‘three-seconds later’, and then shows Narrator and MARILLA in a dungeon, surrounded by [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s. Narrator questions how this could have happened, because hostile mobs only spawn in complete darkness, and MARILLA's screen was lit up. MARILLA answers that she doesn't count as true light, because there is too much darkness in her.

Narrator draws his [[sword]] and says 'En Garde' to a zombie, which he believes to mean 'I surrender' in French. MARILLA (in French) requests the zombie to take Narrator instead of her. Narrator throws his sword at the zombie and it bounces harmlessly off. Narrator screams.

=== Episode 2: Desert of Doom ===
{{yt|JhgN2FVENSE|align=right}}
The episode begins with Narrator and MARILLA surrounded by hostile mobs under MOBBO'S A REAL RESTAURANT. Just as the mobs are about to attack, a desert [[villager]] who appears to be a waiter appears out of nowhere and stops the action. He then asks if he can take Narrator and MARILLA's order.
The Narrator responded with, "Um, can we have... an unlikely escape?" MARILLA expressed her desire for the word "food" to be typed on her keyboard.
Following the explosion that created a hole in the wall, they swiftly made their escape from MOBBO'S A REAL RESTAURANT using a [[minecart]]. Thinking they had escaped hostile mobs, they were startled to discover set of hostile mobs in a minecart trailing closely behind them.
They weren't concerned at first, thinking respawning at their beds was a safety net. But then MARILLA admitted she accidentally set the game to hardcore mode, making their encounter with the chasing hostile mobs more serious.

As they entered the [[desert]] biome, the Narrator remarked that desert levels are as old as him. MARILLA questioned if they were centuries old. Narrator ignored her question and explained that in early video games, it was simpler to render deserts than Metropolis. The narrator continued, noting that although it's now possible to add more features to the desert biome, developers intentionally keep it hostile for a challenging gaming experience.
MARILLA inquired about theme parks, leading the narrator to spot [[Mobboland|MOBBOLAND]] ahead. The theme park was filled with large Mobbo heads made of wool. The narrator, realizing the transition from the desert biome to the theme park, remarked that it was too late to save the desert biome. MARILLA questioned, "From being boring?" The narrator clarified, "From being a challenge."

=== Episode 3: Woodland Mansion Mystery ===
{{yt|YRPlscod34Y|align=right}}
In Episode 3 of Woodland Mansion Mystery, the heroes, Marilla and the Narrator, are accused of game-overing Steve—something they definitely didn’t do, despite Marilla’s casual slip-ups like claiming, “We would never hurt Alex!” After some confusion, the Narrator explains that Woodland Mansions were added to Minecraft in 2016 as rare structures meant to make players feel lucky when they find one. The mansion has a fairy-tale vibe, with a nod to Hansel and Gretel, but Marilla quickly derails that theory, turning her attention to the [[illagers]] who inhabit these mansions. The real reason behind the mansion’s creation, as the Narrator explains, is that it was designed to house the illagers for [[Minecraft Dungeons]], though Marilla remains upset that they got a mansion while she’s stuck with no house at all.

As the investigation into Steve’s apparent game-over deepens, the heroes uncover two crucial clues: the wool blocks in the mansion match the colors of Steve’s outfit, and Steve couldn’t have been truly “game-overed” while holding a [[totem of undying]]. Despite Marilla’s doubts, the Narrator confidently declares that Steve is alive and well, disproving the accusation. Just when it seems like the mystery is solved, Cranky Jonathan, a new threat, emerges, leaving the fate of the overworld uncertain. The episode ends on a dramatic cliffhanger, teasing the next adventure—Monsters of Minecraft, with the possibility of humanity itself being the real monster.

=== Episode 4: Monsters of Minecraft ===
{{yt|4ZsbkMrSeq0|align=right}}
In Episode 4 of Monsters of Minecraft, our heroes, Marilla and the Narrator, face the terrifying [[Mega-Mobbo]] and realize they need an army to stand a chance. They summon a variety of mobs, including the [[Wither]], a boss mob that players must summon themselves, as well as [[Elder Guardians]], designed to thwart players with [[mining fatigue]]. Their next mission leads them to the [[Illager Beast]], a now-goofy but once more sinister mob known as the Ravager. After recruiting their strange army, the duo believes they’re ready to fight Mega-Mobbo, but things quickly take a turn when they are confronted by Jonathan Minecraft, a coffee boy with a grand plan to destroy half of Minecraft using the Minefinity Gauntlet.

With a snap of his fingers, Jonathan plans to change the [[Overworld]], but the heroes are thrown into chaos. As Jonathan begins his world-altering scheme, Marilla and the Narrator struggle to keep up. The episode ends on a cliffhanger, teasing the final showdown in next month’s The End of Minecraft, leaving viewers wondering if they can stop Jonathan from reshaping the world in his image.

=== Finale: The End of Minecraft ===
{{yt|GW2l7X7wdtw|align=right}}
In the finale of Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes, the chaos escalates as Jonathan Minecraft, with his Mobbocraft update, transforms the Overworld into a strange and modernized version of Minecraft. Marilla and the Narrator find themselves trapped in a cage but manage to escape when they realize the door is unlocked. Their mission to stop Jonathan from completely rewriting Minecraft leads them through various biomes and finally to face Mobbo, Jonathan's creation. However, Mobbo isn't the only threat; Jonathan reveals his plan to replace Minecraft with Mobbocraft, a version of the game that players can "finish" without even playing it.

The two protagonists, despite their disagreements, try to reason with Jonathan, who is determined to make the world his own. In a final twist, the Narrator and Marilla attempt to delete this version of Minecraft to save it, leading to a heroic sacrifice. However, in true fashion, they choose not to sacrifice themselves, opting instead to abandon Minecraft to its fate, leaving it doomed forever.

The episode ends with a humorous twist: the Narrator buys an RV and drives into the desert to make bootleg [[minecoins]], while Marilla returns to her home planet, ready to testify against him. The production team thanks the few remaining viewers, and the series wraps up with the promise of "goodbye forever," leaving an oddly satisfying end to the bizarre journey.
