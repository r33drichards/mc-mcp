=== Mobs ===
'''[[Killer rabbit]]'''
* Texture of the killer rabbit changed from [[File:The Killer Bunny JE2.png|32px]] to [[File:The Killer Bunny JE3.png|32px]].
** It is now more bloody and has darker and differently shaped eyes, making it much more distinct from the white textured rabbit.
* Automatically spawns with a name tag 'The Killer Bunny'.
* No longer tries to attack the player in [[Creative]] mode.
* No longer spawns naturally.
* Changed the black and white mottled fur rabbit's eye color from pink to black.

'''[[Rabbit]]s'''
* Now use the AI of regular passive mobs.
** They cannot be tamed, and do not flee from the player.
<!--** When idle, their motion resembles more that of any other passive mob. <!-- what does that mean? -->
** When hit, they leap in random directions.
