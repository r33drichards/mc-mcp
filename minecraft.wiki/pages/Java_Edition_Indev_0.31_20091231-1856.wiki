== Removals ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative]]'''
* Creative inventory is no longer accessible, as the key-bind for it has been removed, and there is no way to set a key-bind for it in the options menu. Its class file has also been removed.
* No Creative build of this version was released, so this change goes unused, and can only be found via modifying the game.
'''[[Commands]]'''
* Removed all commands.

== Bugs ==
'''1 bug reported'''
* This version had an issue with mouse controlling.<ref name="additions and mouse control"/>
** This is caused by having an outdated [[Wikipedia:LWJGL|LWJGL]] version<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(14:01:22) <Notch> it's because I forgot to update LWJGL to the new version"</ref>

== Trivia ==
* Until [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], all versions, with the exception of [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100113-2015 (Creative)|Indev 0.31 20100113-2015 (Creative)]] are in [[Survival]] mode only. 
** Note that most Creative mode functionality was still present in the code even through [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3|Beta 1.7.3]]. ([[Creative]] mode was re-added in [[Beta 1.8 Pre-release]], 618 days later). As a result, Creative mode can still be enabled in these versions via mods.
