'''24w44a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.4]], released on October 30, 2024<ref>{{snap|24w44a|October 30, 2024}}</ref>, that adds the [[eyeblossom]] and [[resin]] family blocks, makes [[Winter Drop]] features available in normal gameplay (replacing the "Winter Drop" [[experiment]]) and fixes bugs.

'''{{Animate|Closed Eyeblossom.png;Open Eyeblossom.png|32px}} [[Eyeblossom]]s'''
* New flowers that generate in the pale garden biome.
** They exist in two variants: closed and open.
** Eyeblossoms transition between the two variants based on the time of day.
*** During the night, eyeblossoms become open.<!-- What does this mean, add explaination and images -->
*** During the day, they become closed.
** In dimensions that do not have a day/night cycle, they remain as-is.
** Eyeblossoms planted on the ground communicate with each other, helping each other to open or close.
** Open eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night.
** Can be obtained by bonemealing the grass in the pale garden biome.
** [[Bee]]s get poisoned when they interact with eyeblossoms.
** [[Suspicious stew]] made from eyeblossom has Blindness or Nausea effect depending on the variant.
** Gray or orange dye can be crafted from closed and open eyeblossoms, respectively.
** [[Wandering trader]]s can sell open eyeblossoms.
** The closed and open variations can each be placed in [[flower pots]].
