The {{JP|'''Tasty Cobblestone Block'''|おいしい丸石ブロック|Oishī Maruishi Burokku|lead=yes}} is a giant, food-filled [[cobblestone]] block. It is created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
The Tasty Cobblestone Block resembles a regular block of [[cobblestone]].

== Functionality ==
The Tasty Cobblestone Block is designed as a trap for [[silverfish]], particularly the [[Replicating Silverfish]]'s swarm. Since silverfish naturally love cobblestone, the block's appearance draws them in, where they discover the food inside and can't help but crowd around to eat it.
