'''Giant snowballs''' (巨大雪玉, ''Kyodai Yukidama'') are massive balls of snow created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
As the name implies, giant snowballs are giant balls of snow, multiple times taller than a human.

== Functionality ==
Giant snowballs can be used as a weapon to crush others, by rolling them down a slope. However, due to their nature as snow, they are not particularly harmful, and serve primarily as a delaying tactic.
