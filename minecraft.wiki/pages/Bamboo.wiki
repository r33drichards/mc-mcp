{{relevant tutorial|Bamboo farming}}
'''Bamboo''' is a versatile, fast-growing [[plant]] found primarily in [[jungle]]s, used for [[crafting]] (particularly [[scaffolding]] and [[Block of Bamboo|bamboo wood]]), [[smelting]], and breeding [[panda]]s.

A '''bamboo shoot''' is the initial non-solid sapling form of planted bamboo.

== Obtaining ==
Bamboo shoots in item form cannot be obtained through vanilla means. {{IN|bedrock}}, they can be obtained through [[add-on]]s or inventory editing. {{IN|java}}, they do not exist as items and are thus completely unobtainable.  Like most other [[Sapling|saplings]], limiting its possible growing conditions can keep it in its initial state.

=== Breaking ===
Bamboo stalks can be mined with any [[tool]], but an [[axe]] is quicker than other tools. Using a [[sword]] of any type breaks bamboo stalks and shoots [[instant mining|instantly]], even with [[Mining Fatigue]]. Flowing [[water]] also breaks bamboo shoots, but not mature bamboo stalks.

{{notelist}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Bamboo (feature)}}
Bamboo generates in widely scattered single shoots within [[jungle]] biomes. Bamboo generates much more densely in the [[bamboo jungle]]s, covering large areas of the landscape. Bamboo does not generate in [[sparse jungle]]s.

=== Mob loot ===

{{Drop sources|Bamboo}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|bamboo}}

=== Fishing ===
Bamboo can be found while [[fishing]] in [[jungle]] biomes as a junk [[item]].

== Usage ==
When broken, any bamboo [[block]] placed or grown above it is also broken. A bamboo block drops itself as an [[item]] if a [[piston]] pushes it or moves a block into its space. When bamboo is first placed as a shoot it’s not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it. After growing at least one block taller it becomes a solid stalk and cannot be destroyed by water. To transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it.

Unlike most plants, bamboo cannot be [[compost]]ed.<ref>{{bug|MC-142452|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Farming ===
Bamboo can be planted on [[moss block]]s, [[pale moss block]]s, [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[gravel]], [[mycelium]], [[podzol]], [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[suspicious sand]], [[suspicious gravel]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], or other bamboo shoots. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every {{convert|4096|ticks|seconds}}. When [[bone meal]] is {{control|used}} on it, it grows by 1–2 [[block]]s. Bamboo can grow up to 12–16 blocks tall. The top of a bamboo plant requires a [[light]] level of 9 or above to grow.

Because bamboo breaks in almost the same way as [[sugar cane]], [[Tutorials/Sugar cane farming|a sugar cane farm]] can be easily adapted to this use. While water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.

=== Pandas ===
Bamboo [[item]]s are eaten by [[panda]]s and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas. Bamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 1 bamboo block (not a bamboo shoot) is within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements. At this point, the [[player]] can feed them bamboo and they [[breeding|mate]] to have a baby.

=== Fuel ===
Bamboo can be used as fuel for [[smelting]]. Each bamboo item smelts 0.25 [[item]]s.

Bamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.
* By crafting a [[Block of Bamboo]] (9 bamboo) into 2 [[Planks#Crafting|bamboo planks]], 3 items can be smelted instead of 2.25, a 33.3% increase in efficiency.
** {{IN|bedrock}}, the fuel efficiency can be further doubled by crafting the bamboo planks into twice the amount of [[slab]]s.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-94368||Wooden slabs last for the same amount of time as planks in a furnace}}</ref>

=== Flower pots ===
Bamboo can be placed in a [[flower pot]], where it retains the design it has in its item form.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

== Appearance ==
[[File:Bamboo stages.png|thumb|The different stages of bamboo growth.]]

The appearance of bamboo changes as it grows. When first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot that has no [[hitbox]]. When it grows one [[block]] taller, its visual thickness increases to 2×2 pixels and the top block has leaves. At 3 blocks tall, the top two blocks have leaves. At 4 blocks tall, the bamboo's visual thickness expands to 3×3 pixels. At 5 blocks tall, the top three blocks have leaves on them, and these blocks remain on top as the bamboo grows. Destroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it. Bamboo is oriented randomly in the block that it is in.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|}}

== Trivia ==
* Because bamboo grows quickly (on average 1 growth per 200 seconds), just 500 plants in an automatic farm produce more [[item]]s than a [[hopper]] can collect (2.5 items per second). A single hopper can move only enough items to keep 6.25 [[furnace]]s running.
* Bamboo is the fastest-growing plant in ''[[Minecraft]]'', which reflects its status as the fastest-growing plant known in real life.
* While bamboo cannot be composted in ''Minecraft'', it can be composted in real life.
