== Changes ==
=== Entities ===
'''General'''
* Tags <code>CustomName</code> and <code>CustomNameVisible</code> now work on all entities.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|clone}}'''
* Mode now can additionally be <code>move</code> or <code>force</code>.
** <code>move</code> moves the selection from the first location to the second location, which may overlap.
** <code>force</code> forces the cloning operation, even if the areas overlap; to use this option, either <code>replace</code> or <code>masked</code> must be specified.
