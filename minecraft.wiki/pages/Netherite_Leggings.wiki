'''Netherite leggings''' are a late-game variant of [[leggings]] obtained by upgrading [[diamond leggings]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]]. They are the highest [[tier]] of leggings, having higher armor toughness, durability, and [[enchantability]] than diamond leggings. Like all [[netherite armor]], netherite leggings provide 10% [[knockback resistance]] when worn, are immune to burning from [[fire]] and [[lava]] in item form, and take no durability damage from lava when worn.

== Usage ==
When worn, netherite leggings provide {{armor|6}} [[armor points]], {{armor|3}} [[armor toughness]], and 1 (10%) [[knockback resistance]].

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
Two damaged pairs of netherite leggings can be combined in a [[crafting grid]], a [[grindstone]] or an [[anvil]]. The durability of the two pairs is added together, plus a bonus 5% of the maximum durability.

Crafting or using a grindstone does not preserve enchantments on the leggings.

Using an anvil preserves enchantments on the leggings, but costs [[experience]].

==== Unit repair ====
Netherite leggings can also be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[Netherite Ingot|netherite ingots]], with each ingot restoring 25% the leggings maximum durability, rounded down. This preserves the leggings [[enchantment]]s, but costs experience.

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], leggings, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
