'''Torches''' are non-solid [[block]]s that emit [[light]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Torches can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] using anything, and drop themselves as an item.
{{breaking row|Torch|horizontal=1}}
A torch is removed and drops itself as an item if:
*Its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
*[[Water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space
*A [[piston]] pushes it or moves a block into its space

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|head=1
|B2= Coal; Charcoal
|B3= Stick
|Output= Torch, 4
|type= Decoration block
|foot=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
In the [[Overworld]], torches can be found among the supports in a [[mineshaft]]'s corridors, as part of [[village]] lamp posts and most houses, in various rooms in [[stronghold]]s, in the basements of [[igloo]]s, in [[woodland mansion]]s, and on top of [[pillager outpost]]s. Torches also generate around [[bonus chest]]s if each side has a block at the same height around it. Torches also generate in [[ancient cities]].

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|torch}}

=== Post-generation ===
When the [[ender dragon]] dies or is re-summoned using [[end crystal]]s, the four torches on the exit portal regenerate. If the original torches are still in position, they drop as [[item (entity)|items]], and the new torches take their place.

== Usage ==
[[File:Torch Orientations.png|thumb|Torches in various positions on [[chiseled stone bricks]].]]

Torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some blocks require {{control|sneaking}}. Being non-solid, torches have no collision box. More information about placement can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

Gravity-affected blocks like [[sand]] and [[gravel]] will not start falling if the space immediately beneath is occupied by a torch. Falling blocks break if they fall onto a solid block with a torch above it. If there is an [[air]] block under the torch, the falling blocks fall through the torch onto the surface below.<ref>{{bug|MC-3262|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Light ===
Torches give off a [[light]] level of 14. Torches also melt [[snow layer]]s within 2 blocks and [[ice]] within 3 blocks ([[taxicab distance]]).

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the top part of torches emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#f39a5e}}. This causes the bottom part of the torch to render a small square shadow.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Torch}}
<!-- (Commenting this out. Inconsistent with other pages and the transparency documentation is still WIP.)
=== Placement ===

In general, torches can be placed only on solid, opaque, full blocks; exceptions are listed below.

More information can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].
