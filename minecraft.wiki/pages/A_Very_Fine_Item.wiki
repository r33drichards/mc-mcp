'''A very fine item''' was a joke item from [[Java Edition 20w14∞]], found only in the {{code|isolation}} dimension.

== Appearance ==
The texture of a very fine item resembles the side face of a grass block with the words "Home Sweet Home" written on it. Unlike most items, its texture is 64×64 pixels, rather than the usual 16×16.

== Obtaining ==
=== Dimension ===
A very fine item can only be obtained from an item frame in the {{Code|isolation}} dimension, at 0,0 there is a house called "house of bob" in the files. A very fine item can only be found in an item frame on the second floor. There is a maximum of 1 fine item that can be found legitimately in any world since there is only one house of bob.

=== Cheats/Creative mode ===
This item can't be found in the [[Creative inventory]], but it can be middle-click duplicated in Creative mode or given with the {{cmd|give <target> minecraft:fine_item <amount>}} command.
