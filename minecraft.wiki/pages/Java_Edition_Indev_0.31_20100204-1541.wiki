A version of '''Indev 0.31''' was released on February 4, 2010,<ref>[[wordofnotch:370690373|Pathfinding mobs for fun and profit]] – The Word of Notch, February 4, 2010</ref> at 15:41 UTC.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Can now avoid dangers like cliffs, [[lava]], etc.<ref name=":0">{{cite|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/796656-everyone-against-the-new-update-post-here|title=Everyone against the new update, post here|date=February 4, 2010|website=Minecraft Forum|quote=You're against pathfinding? You want the mobs to just randomly walk around and happily jump off cliffs? Sure, some new problems have been introduced, but it's the DEVELOPMENT version of the game. It's going to be unstable and buggy at times.}}</ref>
* Mobs now follow the player if they get close enough.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/796656-everyone-against-the-new-update-post-here|title=Everyone against the new update, post here|date=February 4, 2010|website=Minecraft Forum|quote=So far, I can't really see a problem with it - Mobs come at me. Once they attack, it'll make sense. It'll also mean that they won't come at me if I'm too far away from them. I like it so far.}}</ref>
** This is preparation for making mobs hostile.

== Bugs ==
'''2 bugs reported'''
* Mobs spawn in large amounts and never despawn causing enormous amount of lag.<ref name=":0" />
* Major frame rate drops occur in certain conditions, making the game unplayable. This issue was not fixed until partially in [[Indev 0.31 20100205-1558]] and fully in [[Indev 20100206-2034]].

== Trivia ==
*The [[al_version]] number of this version is 1.077, but the [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100202|previous version]]'s is 1.075.
** It possibly means that a version is currently missing, or it might be due to an [[Wikipedia:LWJGL|LWJGL]] update.<ref>{{cite IRC log|Adura|file=2010-02-04_#minecraft.log|tz=standard|date=February 4, 2010|"(12:02:07) <Mikeh> What was the update before the pathfinding one that you didn't announce, Notch?"..."(12:02:22) <Notch> i updated LWJGL to 2.3"}}</ref>
