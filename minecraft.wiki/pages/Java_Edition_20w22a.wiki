'''20w22a''' is the nineteenth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on May 29, 2020,<ref name="20w22a">{{snap|20w22a|May 29, 2020}}</ref> which adds a piglin dance and fixes many bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Jigsaw Block (S) JE3 BE2.png|32px]] [[Jigsaw block]]s'''
* Added a new "Keep Jigsaws" option that controls whether jigsaw blocks in the resulting structure after using "Generate" remain jigsaw blocks or are replaced by their "Turns Into" block.
** Defaults to "ON."

=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Piglin.png; Piglin with Crossbow.png|32px}} [[Piglin]]s'''
[[File:Piglin celebrate hunt Revision 2.gif|thumb|Piglin celebrating dance.]]
* Now have a 10% chance to "dance" after killing a [[hoglin]].
* If they have a sword, they now raise it while aggressive.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death message]]s'''
* Added a new death message for being killed by an entity's wither skull projectile, "<player> was shot by a <entity>'s skull."

=== General ===
'''Shaders'''
* Added <code>assets\minecraft\shaders\post\transparency.json</code>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added new <code>fence_gates</code> block tag.
** Contains all 8 fence gate types.
* Added new <code>unstable_bottom_center</code> block tag.
** Contains the <code>#fence_gates</code> block tag.
** Blocks in this tag cannot support lanterns or bells on their bottom side even if they would otherwise be able to.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bell]]s'''
* Now follow the same placement rules as [[lantern]]s when being placed on the undersides of blocks. As a result, they can now be hung from the bottom of the following blocks:
** [[Anvil]]s (all stages)
** [[Brewing stand]]s
** [[Iron Chain|Chain]]s
** [[Chest]]s
** [[Ender chest]]s
** [[End rod]]s (facing up or down)
** [[Fence]]s (all types)
** [[Flower pot]]s (including potted objects)
** [[Glass pane]]s (including stained)
** [[Grindstone]]s (ceiling attached)
** [[Hopper]]s (downward facing)
** [[Iron bars]]
** [[Mob head]]s
** [[Piston]]s (sideways facing extended)
** [[Trapped chest]]s
** [[Wall]]s (all types)

'''[[Campfire]]s'''
* Now drop food being cooked when put out with a shovel or water bottle.

'''[[Nylium]]'''
* Now drop [[netherrack]] unless broken with [[Silk Touch]], in which case they drop themselves.

'''[[Smithing table]]s'''
* The hammer in the UI has been shifted to the left slightly, and the text has moved up.

'''[[Soul campfire]]s'''
* Now deal double the damage that normal campfires deal.

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Players can no longer mount another entity when the crouch key is held down.

'''[[Bee]]s'''
* Now grow up and count down their breeding cool down when inside a beehive.

'''[[Endermen]]'''
* No longer despawn when holding a block.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Workstation logic changes.
** Villagers no longer try to work at the same workstation.
** When a workstation is placed, the most experienced nearby villager for that corresponding profession gets the workstation.
** Villagers now have to walk to and reach the workstation before they can acquire the profession/work there.
** Villagers check and make sure their workstation is valid at all times of day as long as they are within 16 blocks of their workstation.
* The experience bar now accurately reflects how much experience villagers have and need.
* [[Clock]]s and [[compass]]es no longer function in the villager trading UI.

'''[[Witch]]es'''
* When a villager that was traded with is struck by [[lightning]], the witch it converts to no longer despawns.

'''[[Zombified piglin]]s'''
* Now hold their arms forward, similar to zombies.
* Texture has been tweaked.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Basalt pillar]]s'''
* Now end in the top layer of the lava ocean instead of directly above it.

'''[[Chest loot]]'''
* Is no longer randomized across the same seed.

'''Structures'''
* [[Fossil]]s no longer overlap desert temples.
* Intersecting dungeons no longer replace spawners with cobblestone.
* Fossils, ocean ruins, and dungeons no longer overlap end portals.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|clear}}'''
* Now works properly with the inventory crafting grid.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* "Bee Our Guest" can now be unlocked with both beehives and bee nests, instead of only beehives.

'''[[Repairing]]'''
* Blackstone can now be used to repair stone tools.

=== General ===
'''Collision'''
* Minor optimizations in collision detection.

'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Slightly changed data pack loading to prevent custom data packs from crashing.
* If data pack reload fails, changes are not applied and the game continues using the previous data.
* Changes to data pack list are stored only after a successful reload.
* If existing data packs prevents the world from loading, the game offers the option to load the world in safe mode, which loads only the vanilla data pack.
* Added <code>--safeMode</code> option for servers to load only the vanilla data pack.
* Game now detects any critical data pack issues, such as required tags being missing, and prevents the world from being loaded.

'''[[Material]]s'''
* Whether or not a block requires a tool is now no longer a property of a material and is now assigned on a block-by-block basis.

'''Pathfinding'''
* Cached repeated block type lookups and collisions during pathfinding for increased performance.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Top-level element in predicate file can now be array (all contents are <code>AND</code>ed).

'''Rendering'''
* Made experimental changes to graphics rendering.
* Added shader support for accessing the depth buffer.
* The renderer now uses per-pixel blending layers for some transparent elements.

== Trivia ==
* This snapshot, being the last for 1.16, was released in the same week of the year as the last snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], [[18w22c]].
* Just like [[20w07a]], 20w22a came out on Friday, which almost never happens to the first-of-the-week snapshot.
* 20w22a contained the largest number of bug fixes in a single snapshot, with at least 123, beating [[19w14a]] by at least 18. The record was, however, beaten by [[21w11a]] and [[23w31a]].
