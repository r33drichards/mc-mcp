A '''Nether brick fence''' is a [[Nether bricks|Nether brick]] variant of [[fence]]s used to form [[Nether fortress]]es in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Nether brick fences can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it will drop nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Nether Brick Fence|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
Nether brick fences generate as part of [[Nether fortress]]es, where they form window bars, balcony fencing, and portcullises.

=== Crafting ===
{{crafting

|B2=Nether Brick
|C2=Nether Bricks
|A3=Nether Bricks
|B3=Nether Brick

}}

== Usage ==
{{main|Fence#Usage}}
Nether brick fences are non-flammable and have the same [[Explosion|blast resistance]] as most stone blocks. Nether brick fences have the same usages as [[Fence#Usage|regular fences]] to form barriers and attaching mobs with a lead.

=== Barrier ===
Nether brick fences connect to most blocks, including wooden fence gates, but not wooden fences.

=== Note Blocks ===
Nether brick fences can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sound.
