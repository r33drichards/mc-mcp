'''Wheel of Steve''' is a ''[[Minecraft Education]]'' map promoting {{AMCM}}.

== Summary ==
The player spawns in a room made of black concrete. A 5x3 blocks glowstone wall flashes briefly before a Wheel of Steve poster of identical design as the key art spawns in front of them. The player will then be able to interact with a floating animated "button pressing" hand icon that spawned with the poster to start. A tutorial on how to play varying based on if one is a host, who is considered to be the first player to join regardless of actual hosting status. The player will then be able to choose between red and blue team, called 1 and 2 respectively and start the game from a golden block button.

After starting, the second part of the tutorial plays, after which the player gets teleported in a bigger house with two barrels and shelves with blocks used in minigames and some extra, like brewing stands or cakes that cannot be eaten due to all players being in adventure mode. Outside, in front of the house is the Wheel of Steve and two plains villagers style farms with crops on the right and left. Off bounds is a villagerless village, the iconic Midport natural bridge nad several windmills. Behind the bridge and the house, there is a big lake cut by world soft, endless void world boundaries, while soft boundaries means they are not meant to be impossible to cross by the vanilla game, unlike for instance, endless barrier blocks or old world type invisible bedrock border. Behind the Wheel of Steve are five nether portals with characters to interact with to play their corresponding minigame. As listed below, minigames are of Dawn, Henry, Steve, Garret and Natalie respectively.

=== Elytra Rumble ===
'''Elytra Rumble''' is Dawn's minigame, where teams damage each other's towers by throwing TNT into team volcanoes next to them. Each team spawns on a platform of their color with elytra equipped. To play, players need to pick up a TNT in an elytra rig by flying through it and drop it to the other team's volcano by pressing left mouse button. Team with highest points after time is over wins.

=== Nook it Off ===
'''Nook it Off''' is Henry's minigame, where players shoot targets to score for their team. Players spawn on their team's color concrete on a random edge spot in the "main balcony" in the middle of the circular shooting area. This area has several biome sections with cheering animals and a set of targets. Shooting different targets has different effects, like spawning bats or creating a rainbow, but the effect of one target at a specific spot remains the same throughout gameplay. The team with highest score after time depletes wins.

=== Orb Ambush ===
'''Orb Ambush''' is Steve's minigame, where players need to hold an orb to score for their team. Players spawn on generic platforms that can be walked away from to the play area forward and to play, they must seize the orb from the current holder by right mouse button and then pick up from ground the same way to get score for their team. Highest score at time limit wins. In singleplayer, a custom entity resembling a zombified piglin plays instead. This is the only minigame where points don't get assigned randomly to the memberless team.

=== Contraption Craft-Off ===
'''Contraption Craft-Off''' is Garret's minigame, where teams craft machines to eventually trap their losing opponent in a cage by using them in a bigger construction. Each team has its own enclosed room with shelves. Players need to pick up the appropriate gear on shelves using right mouse button and place it on the crafting table grid according to a board above the grid. The first team to reach 8 points for 8 needed machines for the cage trap wins, even though recipes seem to repeat often and generate randomly. In singleplayer, the same zombified piglin gets trapped if the player wins despite not playing in the unoccupied field in the game and points are still random.

=== Grid Wars ===
'''Grid Wars''' is Natalie's minigame, where players build colored concrete pictures according to patterns appearing on a board same for both teams and changing after a while. Each player has one of the identical enclosed halves surrounded by jungle off bounds with a team board and concrete stands throughout the place, for all colors except yellow multiple. Used concrete colors are yellow, magenta, lime and blue. One player can carry one colored concrete at a time, picked up by a right click. If they make a mistake in placement or color, they need to erase the entire team board. The faster team to build the correct pattern gets a point, most points in a time limit wins.

=== Final Showdown ===
'''Final Showdown''' is the final minigame, referred to as the "secret minigame" by the tutorial. It is the minigame that announces the winning team and is used to determine the ultimate winner, a single player. It takes place at a purely icy mountain surrounded by much bigger icy mountains off bounds so one can't see the sky too low. Players spawn on top of this icy mountain. After the game begins, emeralds start raining and camera moving downwards. Stepping on an emerald gives the player 1 score and removes the emerald. The player with most emeralds at the bottom of the mountain wins. After this minigame, team scores are reset and like with other minigames, players are teleported to the house.

== Trivia ==
* Template options are locked and there is no official way to unlock them.
* Food can be gained by stomping on crops, but it cannot be eaten despite the presence of a hunger bar and easy difficulty.
* It is possible to get out of bounds and use cheats by turning on code builder, exiting the empty tutorial and coding cheat execution.
* The Nether portals cannot be entered without the above method even though they are made to seem accessible.
* The Nether is also limited in size and does not contain any mobs.
* Both team armors might be found in village chests, but team 1's armor is significantly rarer.
* Team 1's armor is significantly better due to it being retextured diamond armor while Team 2's armor is retextured iron armor.
* Despite several features being introduced or "feeling right" (eg. villagers in village or fish in lake), an expansion or these features do not exist as easter eggs:
** A chicken model is made possible to be picked up in the Contraption Craft-Off minigame, but no chicken resembling entity can be picked up.
** There are no villagers in the village, not even in the Nether as a reference to the [[A Minecraft Movie Live Event#The Nether|floating NPCs in the Minecraft Movie Live Event]].
** There are no piglins in the overworld or Nether as a broader reference to the movie either, except for the zombified piglin playing with the player.
** Even though boxer gloves can usually be worn, this part cannot be put in the offhand and does not have an offhand/main hand model.
** The gear part is not animated as turning, missing a reference to the [[Gear]] Block.
* The cheering animals and enderman do not replace vanilla entities.
