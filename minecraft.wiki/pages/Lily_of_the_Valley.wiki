A '''lily of the valley''' is a [[flower]] often found in forested biomes that can be crafted into [[white dye]] and [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A lily of the valley can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A lily of the valley also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===

Lilies of the valley generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[forest]], [[flower forest]], [[birch forest]], [[old growth birch forest]], and [[dark forest]] biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features. In flower forests, they generate both in random patches and as part of the [[Flower#Flower gradients|flower gradient]] {{in|java}}, and only as part of the gradient {{in|bedrock}}.

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

==== {{JE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a flower forest biome, lilies of the valley have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area, depending entirely on the flower gradient. Lilies of the valley cannot be regrown in areas where they generated naturally as part of a random patch,<ref>{{bug|MC-241620||Lily of the valley generation with bone meal in flower forests is extremely scarce}}</ref> as well as in other biomes where it generates naturally.<ref>{{bug|MC-268689||Using bone meal in forest biomes doesn't generate lilies of the valley}}</ref>

==== {{BE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a forest, flower forest, birch forest, old growth birch forest, or dark forest biome, lilies of the valley have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, lilies of the valley can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient.

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a lily of the valley in any biome, more lilies of the valley appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|Java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up lilies of the valley, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell a lily of the valley for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, lilies of the valley can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Lilies of the valley can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a lily of the valley imparts the {{EffectLink|Poison}} effect for 11 seconds, dealing {{hp|8}} damage. It can be crafted using a lily of the valley or produced by feeding a lily of the valley to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with lilies of the valley, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Lilies of the valley can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a lily of the valley have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a lily of the valley into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of lilies of the valley yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

== Issues ==

== Trivia ==
* In real life, lillies of the valley belong to the family Asparagaceae. They are highly poisonous if consumed due to the concentration of cardiac glycosides, something that is reflected with [[Suspicious Stew|suspicious stews]] made from it.
