== Usage ==

=== Food ===
To eat rabbit stew, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|10}} [[hunger]] and 12 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]]. This restores more hunger than any other food type in the game except [[cake]], but has less saturation than a [[golden carrot]], a [[cooked porkchop]], or a [[steak]].

Eating rabbit stew leaves the player with an empty bowl, similar to [[mushroom stew]], [[suspicious stew]], and [[beetroot soup]].

=== Wolves ===
Rabbit stew can be fed to [[wolves]] only if they are not at full health, healing them by {{hp|20|mob=1}} However, {{in|Bedrock}}, unlike other wolf food, rabbit stew cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves nor used to breed them and can only be fed to a wolf that is not at full health.

{{in|je}}, feeding a wolf rabbit stew leaves the player with an empty bowl.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* If the ingredients of rabbit stew were eaten separately and the [[mushroom]] had become half of a [[mushroom stew]], they would restore a total of {{Hunger|16}} and 19.2 saturation points. Without counting the mushroom, the separate ingredients would restore {{Hunger|13}} and 15.6 saturation points. Therefore, crafting rabbit stew results in a net loss of restorative points, though it is quicker than eating all the ingredients separately.
* Rabbit stew restores more hunger and total food points (hunger + saturation) than nearly any other single item (the exception is a suspicious stew with Saturation).  This is balanced by the point that the stew does not stack, and with its complex recipe it's not so easy to make "on the road". The suspicious stew shares the unstackability, but with only four ingredients it can at least be crafted in the inventory.
