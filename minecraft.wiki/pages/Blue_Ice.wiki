'''Blue ice''' is a solid [[block]] similar to [[packed ice]] and [[ice]], but much more slippery. It is the fastest [[Ice (disambiguation)|ice type]] for [[boat]] riding and can be used to generate [[basalt]] in conjunction with [[Soul Soil|soul soil]] and [[lava]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Blue ice can be obtained using any [[tool]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], although a [[pickaxe]] is the fastest. Breaking the [[block]] without Silk Touch drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Blue ice naturally generates on the bottom of [[Iceberg (feature)|iceberg]]s and as large arching structures in [[frozen ocean]] [[biome]]s.
It also generates as [[pile]]s in some [[snowy plains]] village houses, and in [[ancient city|ancient cities]]. Rarely, an iceberg generates entirely made of blue ice.

It takes 81 regular [[ice]] made into [[Packed Ice|packed ice]] to create a single blue ice block. 

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s occasionally sell blue ice for 6 [[emerald]]s.

== Usage ==

Blue ice is slippery, causing most [[entity|entities]] to slide, including [[item]]s. It is even more slippery (0.989) than [[ice]] or [[packed ice]] (0.98). This allows for increased speed of items in [[water]] currents by placing the blue ice under the water current. [[Mob]]s do not travel faster in water currents on blue ice. 

[[Boat]]s can travel even faster on blue ice than on either normal ice or packed ice, being able to reach a top speed of 72.73 m/s (as opposed to 40 m/s on ice and packed ice).<!-- Tested on superflat, full ice cover, Java 1.17.1

Seems to be the same on Bedrock 1.20.32; no exact speed measured but estimated to be similar -->  Ice tracks built from blue ice, packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three [[dimension|dimensions]].

Blue ice is a completely solid [[block]] and allows the placement of any objects on top.

Unlike normal ice, blue ice does not melt when placed near [[light]] sources.

Blue ice can be used to create [[basalt]]. When [[lava]] flows into a space above [[Soul Soil|soul soil]] and next to blue ice, basalt is formed. This can be used in a [[Tutorial:Basalt farming|basalt generator]].

Blue ice is not a storage block, as it cannot be crafted back into packed ice.
