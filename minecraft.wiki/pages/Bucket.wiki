== Usage ==
Empty buckets can be used to "pick up" a [[water]] or [[lava]] source block by pressing {{control|use}} [[item]] on a block of the relevant type. If the empty bucket is part of a stack and the player's [[inventory]] is full, the filled bucket drops in front of the player as an item. 

A bucket filled with a source block can then be used to {{control|place}} its source block contents in the empty block next to the side of the block the player is currently looking at, or replacing the block looked at for some replaceable blocks.

One can press {{control|use}} when looking at a [[cow]], [[mooshroom]], or [[goat]] to fill a bucket with [[milk]]. A bucket full of milk can be emptied only by drinking it or by using it to craft a [[cake]].

A bucket full of water can be used on a live aquatic mob ([[cod]], [[salmon]], [[tropical fish]], [[pufferfish]], [[axolotl]], or [[tadpole]]) to collect the mob in the bucket for transportation to another location. The mob in item form becomes a [[bucket of aquatic mob]].

An empty bucket can be used to empty a [[cauldron]] with [[water]] or [[lava]], filling the bucket with the fluid. This does not work with [[dispensers]]<ref>{{bug|MC-165196|||Invalid}}</ref>.

A [[lava bucket]] placed in the fuel slot of a [[furnace]] becomes an empty bucket after the lava is consumed during [[smelting]].

An empty bucket fills with [[water]] when placed in the fuel slot of a [[furnace]] while smelting a [[wet sponge]].

An empty bucket can be used to collect [[powder snow]], filling the bucket with powder snow. Emptying the powder snow bucket places the powder snow block in the empty block next to the side of the block the player is currently looking at.
