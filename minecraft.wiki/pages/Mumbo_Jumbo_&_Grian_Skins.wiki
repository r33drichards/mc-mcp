'''Mumbo Jumbo & Grian Skins''' is a [[skin pack]] that includes the skins of the ''Minecraft'' web video creators [[Mumbo Jumbo]] and [[Grian]]. It was exclusively given to Mumbo Jumbo and Grian for use in the production of their "Minecraft Earth Road Trip" video series which debuted at [[MINECON Live 2020]].<ref>{{ytl|MI0xtYsyvtU|Minecraft Live: Minecraft Earth Road Trip|Minecraft|October 14, 2020}}</ref> The release of the skins as a skin pack was necessary due to ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'' lacking an option to import custom skin files.
