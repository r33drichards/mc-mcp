'''<samp>minecraft:dupe_hack</samp>''' is a joke item from [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]]. It [[Missing model|does not have an item model]].

== Obtaining ==
Once the <code>dupe_hack_occurrence_chance</code> vote is approved, the '''dupe hack''' item has a random chance of dropping whenever an entity with chests is killed by a player, e.g. when destroying a [[minecart with chest]] with a [[sword]].

It doesn't appear in the [[Creative inventory]], not even when the option "[[Operator Items Tab]]" is enabled, but can be given to the player with {{cmd|give}} and other commands.

== Usage ==
The dupe hack item can be used to create a limited amount of duplicate items by placing it on a [[crafting table]] with any other item. It has a random chance of breaking, controlled by the <code>dupe_hack_break_chance</code> vote. This limitation can be mitigated by putting the items in a [[shulker box]] first and then duplicating the box.
