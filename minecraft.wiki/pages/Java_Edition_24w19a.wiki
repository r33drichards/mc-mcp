== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
''' [[Copper bulb]]'''
* Replaced the sounds for "turn off" and "turn on" with one "toggle" sound.

'''[[Sculk sensor]] and [[calibrated sculk sensor]]'''
* Added [[frosted ice]] being placed by [[Frost Walker]] to the list of events that produce a "Block Placed" vibration (frequency 13).{{Info needed|if the enchantment is modified with a resource pack or if a resource pack adds a similar enchantment, will blocks placed by the enchantment in this manner trigger the "Block Placed" vibration?}}

[[File:Trial Spawner JE4 BE3.png|width=32x32]]''' [[Trial spawner]]'''
* Updated the top face texture and the active state texture.

=== Items ===
''' [[Mace]]'''
* [[Fire Aspect]] can be applied to maces again.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* [[Breach]] and [[Density]] are now incompatible.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>43</code>.
* Registry decorated_pot_patterns has been renamed to <code>decorated_pot_pattern</code>.
* Renamed directories; each directory that used the plural name of its element now matches registry name:

{| class="wikitable"

|-

| <samp>tags/game_event</samp>
|}

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* The <code>custom_data</code> component can now be specified as an SNBT string to preserve type information in JSON.
** This is the same as is used in the <code>set_custom_data</code> loot function and <code>custom_data</code> predicate.
* The <code>food</code> item component has new fields:
** <code>using_converts_to</code>: item with components (optional).
*** Once consumed, the food item is replaced with the specified item.
*** e.g. <code>food={nutrition:1,saturation:0,using_converts_to:{id:"poisonous_potato",components:{"minecraft:custom_name":'"Wait what?"'}}}</code>.

'''[[Entity format]]'''
* Removed <code>power</code> tag and replaced with <code>acceleration_power</code> tag with a number value that control the projectile's acceleration (and maximum speed).
** This change affects the following projectiles; <code>dragon_fireball</code>, <code>large_fireball</code>, <code>small_fireball</code>, <code>fireball</code>, <code>breeze_wind_charge</code>, <code>wind_charge</code>, <code>wither_skull</code>.

'''[[Custom structure]]'''
* New tag <code>dimension_padding</code> for structures.
** Ensures that a structure is not generating through the edges of a dimension by adding vertical padding to its bounding box.
** Default is <code>0</code>.
** Trial chambers have a padding of 10 since they are generated deep underground and would sometimes intersect with bedrock layer.

'''Entity effect types'''
* Adds optional field <code>trigger_game_event</code> for effect types <code>replace_block</code>, <code>replace_disc</code> and <code>set_block_properties</code>.
** Game event ID for a game event to trigger when a block has been replaced.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>fire_aspect_lightable</code> to each block that should be possible to light by {{control|hitting}} it with a tool that has [[Fire Aspect]].

'''Damage type predicate'''
* New option: <code>is_direct</code> - optional boolean.
** When present, <code>true</code> requires the damage to be direct and <code>false</code> requires the damage to be indirect.
** Damage is direct when its direct and source entities are the same.

'''Performance'''
* When reading an already generated chunk from disk, surrounding chunks are no longer unnecessarily loaded, reducing memory and CPU overhead.
