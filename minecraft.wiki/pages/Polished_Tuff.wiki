'''Polished tuff''' is a polished variant of the [[tuff]] block. Polished tuff's appearance matches to that of other [[polished]] rock materials, having two lighter edges and two darker edges on each face to mimic the appearance of a singular large and smoother stone.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Polished tuff drops as an item if mined by any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.
