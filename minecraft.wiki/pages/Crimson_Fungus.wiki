A '''crimson fungus''' is a mushroom-like block that generates in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A crimson fungus can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] and always drops itself. Mining a [[flower pot]] containing a crimson fungus drops both items separately.
{{breaking row|Crimson Fungi|link=Crimson Fungus|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Crimson Fungi naturally generate in the [[crimson forest]] and [[warped forest]] biomes, with crimson fungus most commonly generating in its respective biome, the crimson forest and less frequently in the other, the warped forest.

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a crimson fungus drops the fungus upon death.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|crimson-fungus}}

=== Post-generation ===
Applying [[bone meal]] to [[nylium]] causes crimson fungi to appear nearby, similar to [[flower]]s on [[grass block]]s. While crimson fungi and other Nether vegetation can generate this way, they are more likely to be the same type as the nylium.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
[[File:FungusPlaceBlock.png|thumb|All of the blocks that crimson fungi can be placed on.]]
Crimson fungi may be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[podzol]], [[farmland]], [[rooted dirt]], [[moss block]]s, [[nylium]], [[mycelium]], [[soul soil]], [[mud]] and [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Attempting to place it on any other block fails. Crimson fungi requires a solid block underneath it, and pops off and drops itself if it is no longer supported.

Crimson fungi can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Growth ===
When [[bone meal]] is {{ctrl|used}} on a crimson fungus that is planted on [[crimson nylium]], it has a 40% chance to grow into its tall equivalent (similar to [[sapling]]s and [[mushroom]]s). Crimson fungi grow into [[huge crimson fungi]]. The [[log|stem]], [[shroomlight]], or [[wart block]]s may replace certain blocks including [[slab]]s and [[torch]]es.

=== Breeding ===
Crimson fungus can be used to breed [[hoglin]]s and keep them from despawning, but feeding hoglins does not stop them from attacking the player.

=== Composting ===
Placing a crimson fungus into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
