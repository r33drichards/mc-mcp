<!--TO ALL: "sheared" and "shorn" are both perfectly acceptable. However "sheared" is more commonly used, and is also more obviously the past participle of "shear". Therefore, for clarity and continuity's sakes, "sheared" should be used on this page.
"Sheep" is the correct plural form.-->

A '''sheep''' is a common [[passive mob]] that supplies [[wool]] and [[raw mutton]] and is found in many of the grassy [[biome]]s.

== Spawning ==
The sheep color is determined by the type of biome the sheep spawns in.

If a [[monster spawner]] is set to spawn sheep, the sheep model spinning inside appears with one of {{tooltip|the six naturally spawning colors|Refer to the table above for the specific colors.}}. Independently from the displayed color, all six variants are able to spawn and the usual chances apply. To guarantee that sheep always spawn with the desired color, additional NBT tags can be applied to the monster spawner, utilizing the <code>Color</code> tag.

=== Natural generation ===
{{IN|Java}}, 4 sheep may spawn above grass blocks at a light level of 9 and higher, even in snowy taigas, but not in pale gardens.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, 2 to 3 sheep spawn during the world generation on [[grass block]]s at the surface with at least a 2 block space above at a light level of 7 and higher, except in [[pale garden]]s, [[snowy plains]], [[ice spikes]], or [[wooded badlands]]. They later spawn individually on grassy biomes. 

Two sheep sometimes spawn in shepherd houses, butcher houses, and animal pens in [[village]]s.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===

|{{DropLine|name=Raw Mutton|notes=not_burn|quantity=1-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Cooked Mutton|notes=burn|quantity=1-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Wool|spritetype=BlockSprite|image=wool|notes=wool}}
|notes=
wool = Color of dropped wool corresponds to color of sheep. A sheared sheep does not drop wool when killed.
}}

{{xp|1|3}} experience orbs if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].

Killing a baby sheep yields no [[item]]s nor [[experience]].

=== Shearing ===
When [[shear]]ed, sheep give 1–3 wool and do not take any damage. This is not affected by [[Fortune]] or [[Looting]].

=== Breeding ===
Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.

== Behavior ==
Sheep wander aimlessly and individually or in small flocks of two to four. Sheep avoid cliffs and hazardous areas if it warrants [[damage]]. Sheep emit hoarse bleats in mostly random patterns and especially when attacked. If harmed, sheep flee for a few seconds, but make no special attempt to avoid [[wolves]].

Sheep do not usually interact with players or other mobs, but follow a [[player]] holding [[wheat]] within a six blocks radius. Adult sheep cannot fit through a gap of the 90-degree intersection of two [[fence]]s when the corner fence is removed, whereas the player and most other mobs can fit through easily (although mobs won't path-find through this gap).

[[File:Sheep eating grass.gif|left|thumb|A sheared sheep eating grass and regrowing its wool.]]
Sheep graze [[short grass]], [[short dry grass]], [[tall dry grass]], and [[fern]]s (but not [[tall grass]] or [[large fern]]s), making them disappear, and [[grass block]]s, changing them into [[dirt]] blocks. Baby sheep graze grass much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing. Sheep can eat grass through [[Solid block#Height|blocks that are lower than a full block]], including extremities such as [[honey block]]s, as well as from inside [[minecart]]s. A sheared sheep regrows its wool after grazing. Therefore, if no grass is available, a sheep cannot regrow its wool after being sheared. If an adult sheep has the opportunity, the chance of eating grass is {{frac|1|1000}} every other game [[tick]] ({{fraction|1|50}} for baby sheep). If {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is set to {{code|false}}, grass blocks remain, but the sheep still regrow their wool.<ref>{{bug|MC-147444||Sheep eating grass does not turn grass into dirt when mobGriefing is disabled|WAI}}</ref>
{{-}}

=== Dyeing ===
[[File:Wool Colors.png|1000px]]

A sheep's wool can be dyed by pressing the {{control|use}} key or the interact button while holding any [[dye]]. A sheared sheep cannot be dyed until its wool grows back after eating a grass block. Dyeing changes the color of the sheep's wool or until the sheep is dyed again. The new wool colors are inherited by baby sheep.

If a sheep is dyed and then sheared, it retains its new dyed wool color after the wool regrows.

=== Breeding ===
{{See also|Breeding}}
[[File:SheepBreedingColor.png|thumb|An example of how a bred sheep inherits a mixture of its parents' colors when possible.]]
Sheep can be bred using [[wheat]], after which they spawn a baby sheep. They cannot breed for five minutes after the baby sheep appears.

If the parents have compatible wool colors (meaning that the corresponding [[dye]] items could be combined into a third dye color), the resulting baby sheep inherits a mix of their colors (e.g., blue sheep + white sheep = light blue baby sheep).
If the dye colors cannot normally be mixed, the baby sheep spawns with the same color as one of the parents, chosen randomly, regardless of whether one or both parents have been sheared.

The 20-minute growth of a baby sheep can be slightly accelerated using wheat. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up. A baby sheep can also accelerate its own growth by eating grass.

=== Easter eggs ===
{{see also|Easter eggs#Naming mobs}}
[[File:Evoker changing sheep wool color.gif|thumb|Evoker changing sheep's wool color]]
An [[evoker]] can change a sheep's wool color if the evoker isn't engaged in combat and {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is set to <code>true</code>. If that condition is met, it can change the wool color of any blue sheep within 16 blocks to red. It signals the spell by producing orange color particles ({{EffectSprite|particle-evoker-wololo}}) and making a "wololo" sound. This is a reference to the priest unit of the 1997 game ''Age of Empires''. This will still work if they are named <code>jeb_</code>.
[[File:Jeb Sheep JE3 BE3.webp|left|thumb|A sheep named “jeb_”.]]
If a sheep is named <code>jeb_</code>, its wool cycles through all dye colors in [[Dye#Color_values|order]]. This is purely a visual effect. A sheep named <code>jeb_</code> can still be dyed without changing the rainbow effect, and any wool obtained from one of these sheep has the most recent color as if the sheep was not named. The name tag <code>jeb_</code> is an easter egg toward one of the developers [[Jens Bergensten]] or “Jeb” as he is called online.

=== Color values ===
{{IN|java}}, non-white sheep colors are 25% darker as the respective [[Dye#Color values|dye color values]]; white is separately defined as {{color|#E6E6E6}}. Non-white sheep colors are applied to the <code>sheep_wool.png</code> and <code>sheep_wool_undercoat.png</code> textures, while white is applied exclusively to the <code>sheep_wool.png</code> texture (the wool undercoat texture is not rendered for white sheep).

{{IN|bedrock}}, sheep colors use the same values as the base dye colors. The wool textures of white sheep are not tinted.
