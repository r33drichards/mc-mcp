A '''stony shore''' or '''stone beach''' is a coastal [[biome]] that is almost entirely made of [[stone]] and [[gravel]]. Stony shores replace [[beach]] biomes in some mountainous areas. 

== Description ==
A stony shore replaces normal beaches in areas with mountainous terrain at low [[Biome#Erosion|erosion]] values. They are made entirely of [[stone]], with long [[Strip|strips]] of [[gravel]]. They are usually a steep drop into the water they border. Stony shores may generate at high enough elevations to have snow on their peaks (above Y=120±8), even when bordering warm biomes.<ref>{{bug|MC-240697||It snows in the stony shore biomes from Y {{=}} 118 and above}}</ref> Water and lava [[Spring|springs]] frequently generate on the sides of stony shores. {{IN|bedrock}}, buried treasure can sometimes generate at high altitudes, and can even generate at Y=90; {{IN|java}}, it doesn't generate here.<ref>{{bug|MC-127290}}</ref>

The steep drops into the ocean below makes this variant dangerous, especially if the player is unaware of their surroundings.
