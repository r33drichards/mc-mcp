A '''firework rocket''' is an [[item]] that provides a speed boost when {{Control|use|text=used}} while flying with [[elytra]]. It can also be launched as a [[projectile]] either by hand or from a [[crossbow]] or [[dispenser]].

It can also be [[crafted]] using extra [[gunpowder]] to fly farther or with up to seven [[firework star]]s to add customizable [[damage]]-dealing explosions.

== Obtaining ==
Firework rockets can only be obtained by crafting.

{{IN|java}}, firework rockets with no explosive effects and 3 different flight durations are available in the [[Creative inventory]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, 16 firework rockets with the different base colors and the "small ball" effect, and a single firework with no explosion are available in the Creative inventory; these all have a flight duration of 1.

By crafting the rocket using [[Firework Star|firework star]](s), colors, trail, and explosion effects can be added to the fireworks.

== Usage ==
=== Launching fireworks ===
A firework rocket can be launched up vertically by {{control|using}} its item on a block. Firework rockets can also be launched from [[dispenser]]s and [[crossbow]]s.

==== Dispenser ====
Using firework rockets with a dispenser is different than launching it on a block. The direction the dispenser is facing launches the firework in that direction; for example, if the dispenser is facing downward, the firework goes downward instead of going up.

==== Crossbow ====
A firework rocket can be used as ammunition for [[crossbow]]s, although it deals [[damage]] only if it has an [[explosion]] effect. A higher flight duration gives the firework rocket a longer range, and more damage is added per firework star. If shot from a [[Multishot]] crossbow, then 3 rockets fire with the same effects. The [[Piercing]] enchantment has no effect on firework rockets shot from a crossbow.

{{IN|java}}, if a firework rocket shot from a [[crossbow]] hits an [[entity]], the rocket instantly [[explode]]s, no matter the flight duration. Attempting to do this {{in|bedrock}}, however, results in the firework passing through the entity,<ref>{{bug|MCPE-52675||Fireworks do not explode on impact with entity and blocks}}</ref> so the player must plan where to aim.

=== Boosting elytra ===
Normally, [[elytra]] can glide for a short distance, but with the use of fireworks, the player can fly a long distance, gain speed, and take off from the ground. {{control|Using}} a firework rocket while flying with elytra propels the player in the direction they are facing. Using a firework rocket on a block while gliding propels the player instead of launching the firework. If the rocket is equipped with a firework star of any kind, the player takes damage when it explodes.

If any entities are [[leashed]] to the player, they instantly detach from the player when they use a firework rocket while gliding with elytra.

The duration of the speed boost depends on the flight duration of the rocket - a higher flight duration means a longer boost.

!Elytra flight boost duration
|-

|~1.17 seconds
|-
|2
|~1.48 seconds
|-

|~2.22 seconds
|}

=== Village raids ===
After successfully defending a village from a [[raid]], the [[villager]]s may celebrate by setting off firework rockets. If a firework rocket set off by a villager hits a neutral or hostile mob by accident, the mob retaliates and attacks the villager. Additionally, if a villager accidentally attacks the player by setting off a firework rocket, the player’s tamed wolves and trusting foxes attack the villager.

== Behavior ==
{{see also|Firework Star#Effects}}

Once launched, fireworks fly out vertically, with random horizontal offset up to 5 blocks. Fireworks can fly in any of the 6 directions a dispenser can point. After [[#Duration and direction|some time]], the firework explodes into a colorful explosion based on the effects of the [[firework star]]s added upon crafting, or no explosion if no firework star was used. If multiple firework stars were added to the rocket upon crafting, they all explode simultaneously.

The explosion of a firework rocket deals damage to mobs and players that are within 5 blocks and not obstructed by [[solid block]]s. The maximum damage of a rocket with one firework star is {{hp|7}}, with the damage decreasing with distance. Each additional firework star on the rocket adds {{hp|2}} points of damage, for a maximum damage of {{hp|19}} with 7 stars. Using commands to add additional firework stars results in more damage. The damage dealt is unaffected by any other ingredients used. The explosion does not destroy end crystals, item frames, or paintings, but does destroy armor stands and decorative pots.

There is a delay between the detonation and the player hearing the sound, emulating real fireworks, but this sound travels much more slowly than in the real world.<ref>{{Tweet|jeb|277075644804907009|However, no sound effects for fireworks yet... but everything's implemented, so they can be added without doing a new snapshot|December 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|jeb|277075517226762242|Haha, @igblan , the speed of sound is 40 m/s, because the realistic speed of ~340 m/s didn't work well in Minecraft scale|December 7, 2012}}</ref> The explosion of a firework can be seen 64 blocks away, regardless of its height.

If the explosion exceeds the [[particle]] limit of <abbr title="2 ** 14">16,384</abbr>, the oldest particles are removed before displaying new ones, resulting in severely diminished firework quality / duration. At most a firework should have 3 trail stars, more than that could waste diamonds, firework stars, and other fireworks. Particle counts per star are:

{| class="wikitable" data-description="Particle counts per firework star"
|-
! Ball type !! Plain !! Trail
|-
| Small || 98 || ~1300
|-
| Large || 387 || 4000+
|-
| Star || 122 || ~1600
|-
| Creeper || 266 || ~3500
|-
| Burst || 72 || ~930
|}

Twinkle effect adds 2 particles to the count.

Like most other entities, fireworks can be moved by [[water]] and [[explosion]]s, and teleported via [[portal]]s. They also cannot move through solid surfaced blocks: upon hitting one, they either move to a side or explode based on the duration. If a firework explodes under a block, its explosion is flattened.

Non-lethal fireworks and fireworks crafted with firework stars behave differently around terrains. Lethal fireworks when shot at a solid block explode immediately upon impact, while non-lethal fireworks glide on whatever surface they encounter along their paths for the remainder of their duration and may resume their original trajectories upon exiting the surface.

=== Duration and direction ===
Fireworks travel different heights based on the amount of gunpowder added. The number is displayed as a tag on the item's tooltip with the description of "Flight Duration".

Each firework determines its lifetime in ticks by 10 &times; (number of gunpowder + 1) + random value from 0 to 5 + random value from 0 to 6, after which it explodes.

When spawned by player or command, the height it rises is between 8 and 20 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 18 to 34 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 32 to 52 blocks with 3 gunpowder. 
(Note: {{IN|java}}, it is possible to use commands to create firework rockets with higher durations. These rockets go higher and keep accelerating with virtually no terminal velocity. If the duration is long enough, the firework rocket could reach heights of over 1,000,000 blocks and speeds of over 10,000&nbsp;m/s in a matter of minutes. Such fireworks with significant X and Z motions speed up sideways exponentially and reach outside the world boundary in a matter of seconds.)

When spawned, <!-- server-side --> fireworks have a vertical speed of .05 and a random small X and Z speed (random value near zero with a standard deviation of .001). Each tick, the firework accelerates horizontally by multiplying its X and Z velocities by 1.15, and vertically by adding a constant factor of 0.04.

When shot from a dispenser, it travels 9 to 10 blocks with 1 gunpowder, 14 to 15 blocks with 2 gunpowder, and 19 to 20 blocks with 3 gunpowder in the direction it was dispensed. When dispensed, the firework has a random velocity close to 0.5 (with a maximum deviation of .009) in the direction it was dispensed and a random small velocity in both other directions (random value near zero with a maximum deviation of .009). The firework's velocity does not change over the lifetime of the rocket.

Fireworks can be made to travel different directions by being dispensed or launched under flowing water. The firework's direction combines with the flow of the water to go diagonally. The direction changes significantly less if the firework is shot by a dispenser instead of by hand.
