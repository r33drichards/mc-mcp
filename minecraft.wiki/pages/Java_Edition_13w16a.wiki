== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General '''
* Changed the idea of mob difficulty.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|322109941634695168|I may as well say it: I'm trying to change the idea of mob difficulty. Don't know if it'll be finished for 1.6, but I'm part done already.|April 10, 2013}}</ref>
** Regional difficulty: The longer the player stays in one area, the harder it gets.
** Scales with difficulty – Items, enchants or AI improve with difficulty.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Improved [[Respiration]].
** Now also helps seeing underwater (depends on the enchantment level).

'''Riding'''
* Add mob's health bar to the [[heads-up display]] when riding on it (both [[pig]]s and [[horse]]s).
* When riding something, like a mob or a boat, dismounting is only possible using the {{ctrl|sneak}} key.

=== General ===
'''Credits'''
* Added Mo' Creatures developers to {{cd|credits.txt}}.

'''Game window'''
* Now displays the client's version in the window title (for example: "Minecraft 13w16a").

'''Directory structure'''
* {{cd|[[.minecraft]]}} directory structure is changed:
** {{cd|assets}} folder; stores resources such as language packs and sounds.
*** All [[music disc]]s now use {{cd|.ogg}} format instead of {{cd|.mus}} format.
** {{cd|library}} folder; stores Java libraries such as LWJGL and {{cd|jinput.jar}}.
** {{cd|versions}} folder; there are files {{cd|[[client.json|version.json]]}} (meta data) and folders that stores {{cd|[[client.jar|minecraft.jar]]}} for each versions (but its name is the same as its version; the jar for 13w16a is {{cd|versions/13w16a/13w16a.jar}}).
'''[[Game directory]]'''

* Both the game's main class (<code>net.minecraft.client.main.Main</code>) and the new [[launcher]] began to support an optionally specified ''game directory'', where the game stores its files (/saves, options.txt, etc.). The main class' parameter for the game directory was named as (a misleading) <code>--workDir</code>, and it was later changed (in [[Java Edition 13w24a#General|13w24a]]) to a more adequate <code>--gameDir</code>.

== Trivia ==
* This is the earliest snapshot available in the [[Minecraft launcher]]. Although earlier snapshots are not available in the launcher, almost all of them have been archived.
* This is the first snapshot to require Java 6 and is also able to launch with Java 9 and up.
* This is the first snapshot of the older snapshots and versions that are available in the Minecraft launcher to not require be launched by a helper-wrapper class (<code>net.minecraft.launchwrapper.Launch</code>) that was used for ''pre-1.6'' versions to tweak the old code to the modern launcher's needs. This and the later snapshots and versions are being launched normally, by their main class (<code>net.minecraft.client.main.Main</code>).
