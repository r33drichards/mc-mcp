The '''water spawner''' was a [[block]] that would repeatedly create [[water]] on each of its four orthogonal sides.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Water spawners can be broken instantly, regardless of held items.

{{Breaking row|Water Spawner|horizontal=1|foot=1}}

=== Generated loot ===
Water spawners could be found in [[Starting House]] [[chest]]s in stacks of 99 in in-20100124-2310, and stacks of 100 in-20100128. Prior to this, they were added to the player's [[inventory]] by default in a stack of 5.

== Usage ==
[[File:Gears on infinite sources.png|thumb|right|As water spawners are full solid cubes, placed [[gear]]s render on their sides.]]
The water spawner has many visual and functional differences from normal water:
* It is a full, solid cube block with full block collision.
* It is completely opaque.
* All sides use the same still water texture.

=== Creating liquids ===
Immediately after placement, the water spawner creates source blocks of water on each of its four orthogonal sides. If these created sources are removed, they get regenerated after enough time.

=== Sponges ===
Water spawners are deleted by [[sponge]]s.
