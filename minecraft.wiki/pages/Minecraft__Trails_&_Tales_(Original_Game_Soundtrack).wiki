'''''Minecraft: Trails & Tales (Original Game Soundtrack)''''' is the first soundtrack for ''[[Minecraft]]'' by [[Aaron Cherof]]. The album includes 5 songs for a total length of just under 22 minutes.  Its official release date is April 26, 2023.

The music from the soundtrack first appears in Minecraft [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.20.0.22]] and [[Java Edition 23w17a]] snapshot to provide new ambient music selections to the main menu and many existing overworld biomes. It also contains music for a [[Relic|new music disc]] and the [[cherry grove]] biome, both introduced in the 1.20 [[Trails & Tales]] update.

All five songs would later be remixed as part of ''[[Minecraft: Soothing Synths]]'', which was released on September 18, 2023.
