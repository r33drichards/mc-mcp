'''Iron leggings''' are a variant of [[leggings]] that are crafted from [[iron ingot]]s. They are the third-highest [[tier]] of leggings, having higher armor points than [[chainmail leggings]].

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include iron leggings. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[vindicator]]s and [[pillager]]s spawning in [[raid]]s have a 4.16% chance (5.128% on hard difficulty) to drop a pair of iron leggings. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and have a 50% chance of being [[enchanted]] with a random [[enchantment]].

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
When worn, iron leggings provide {{armor|5}} [[armor points]].

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
Two damaged pairs of iron leggings can be combined through [[crafting]], using the [[grindstone]] or the [[anvil]]. The durability of the used iron leggings is added together, plus an extra 5% durability.

Crafting and using the grindstone do not keep the enchantments of either leggings.

==== Unit repair ====
Iron leggings can also be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. This preserves the leggings' [[enchantment]]s, but costs [[experience]].

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a leggings, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
