== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Banner]]s'''
* Added missing upward gradient and right solid half patterns, upside-down diagonal halves, bottom half, and right half.
* Changed the name of existing patterns according to [[wikipedia:Vexillology|Vexillology]].
* Can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s.

'''[[Cobblestone stairs]]'''
* Renamed "Stone Stairs" to "Cobblestone Stairs".

'''[[Daylight sensor]]s'''
* Can be inverted with a right click.
** Reaches full strength at the opposite time than it would when set to normal.
** This can allow for a light that turns on at night rather than day without the need of a NOT gate.

'''[[Ladder]]s & [[melon]]s'''
* Mined faster using [[axe]]s.

=== Items ===
'''[[Map]]s'''
* Zoomed maps now snap to a grid rather than being centered on the original map.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Rabbit]]s'''
* Now take fall damage.
* Now have sounds.
** Have 'hurt', 'death', 'hop', and 'idle' sounds.
*** The 'hop' and 'idle' sounds are barely audible.
* Changed model.  
** Added tail. 

=== World generation ===
'''[[World border]]'''
* The time parameter of the world border size changing can now be larger.
* Only players get damage outside of the world border.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|debug}}'''
* Can now be run in single player.
* New arguments for debug <code>/debug <start|stop|chunk> [<x> <y> <z>]</code>.
** <code>x/y/z</code> are required and valid only for chunk mode.
** May be removed, as the command was supposed to be dev only.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/2c5f35/minecraft_snapshot_14w31a_has_been_released/cjct3k1</ref>

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Items which have been renamed have their tooltips displayed as italic when highlighted, rather than just being straight.<ref>{{bug|MC-5206}}</ref>

'''[[Trading]]'''
* Clerics now sell [[bottles o' enchanting]], prices range from 3 to 11 [[emerald]]s each.
