'''Teleportation''' is a form of [[transportation]] in which the moving object is instantaneously moved to its target location.

== Overview ==
Teleportation can occur under numerous circumstances. The target object appears to instantly be at its destination afterward, usually<ref>{{bug|MC-166291}}</ref> playing a sound in the process (cases, where they do not, are not accidental). It can also refer to entities traveling through [[portal]]s.

== Player teleportation ==
* Throwing an [[ender pearl]].
* Eating a [[chorus fruit]].
* Using the {{command|teleport}} command.
* Passing through a [[nether portal]], [[end portal]], [[exit portal]] or [[end gateway]].
* Entering a [[bed]].
* Mounting a [[horse]], [[mule]], [[donkey]], [[llama]], [[camel]], saddled [[pig]] or saddled [[strider]].
* Entering a [[boat]] or [[minecart]].
* Dying and [[respawn]]ing.
* Quitting and re-logging the game while above the [[Nether]] roof.{{only|be}}

== Other mobs ==
Other mobs can teleport via other methods:

* Tamed [[wolves]], [[cat]]s, and [[parrot]]s teleport to their owner if not [[sitting]] and their owner is far enough away.
* [[Endermen]] teleport under numerous circumstances.
* [[Shulker]]s are also capable of teleportation.
* As with players, [[fox]]es can teleport upon consumption of chorus fruit.
* Other entities can also be teleported using {{command|teleport}}.
* They can be teleported by passing through a [[nether portal]], [[end portal]], [[exit portal]] or [[end gateway]].

== Non-entities ==
[[Dragon egg]]s can also teleport when clicked on.

[[Ender chest]]s allow the same set of items to be accessed from multiple locations, effectively teleporting them.
