A '''firefly bush''' is a decorative [[plant]] that produces firefly particles around it when exposed to [[Light|darkness]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Firefly bushes can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] with any [[item]] or by hand. It always drops itself upon destruction<ref>{{bug|MC-279919||Bushes and Firefly Bushes drop themselves when mined, unlike similar blocks|WAI}}</ref>.

{{breaking row|Firefly Bush|horizontal=1}}

Firefly bushes are also removed and drop as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed.
* water or lava flows into its space.
* a piston tries to push it or moves a block into its space.
* it is placed on a mud block, and that mud block converts to clay.

=== Natural generation ===
Firefly bushes generate in the form of [[random patch]]es, on [[grass block]]s near [[water]] in most Overworld biomes. They also can generate on [[mud]] blocks near water in [[mangrove swamp]]s.

In [[swamp]]s, firefly bushes can generate anywhere, instead of being limited to near water.

Firefly bushes {{in|be}} have fewer exceptions for which biomes they can generate in, but since grass does not naturally generate in all Overworld biomes and the list still excludes [[badlands]], [[eroded badlands]] and [[wooded badlands]], they are actually found in fewer places than {{in|je}}.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a firefly bush, the bush spreads to neighboring blocks.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 firefly bush for 3 [[emerald]]s.

== Usage ==
[[File:Firefly Bushes in Swamp.gif|thumb|Firefly bushes emitting particles at night.]]
A firefly bush emits firefly particles if the [[internal light level]] at its position is 13 or lower. A firefly bush can produce particles even if it is covered by blocks. Firefly particles glow in the dark, but do not actually light up their surroundings. Firefly particles move erratically and collide with solid blocks.

On each [[tick]], a firefly bush has a 70% chance of emitting a new firefly particle in an [[air]] block up to 5 blocks above the bush and horizontally up to 5 blocks away {{in|java}}, or up to 10 blocks away {{in|bedrock}}. A firefly particle lasts between {{convert|200|game tick|second}} and {{convert|300|game tick|second}}, fading from transparency into an opaque pale yellow color, and back into transparency before disappearing.

Firefly bushes have a low [[light]] level of 2. However, when [[snowlogged]] in ''Bedrock Edition'', firefly bushes do not emit any light.

The pulsating "fireflies" on the bush itself remain at maximum brightness regardless of the surrounding light level. This affects placed firefly bushes, but the item form of firefly bushes still appear at the surrounding brightness level.<ref>{{bug|MC-279949||Firefly bush is not emissive in item form|WAI}}</ref>

=== Placement ===
Firefly bushes mainly serve as atmospheric decoration and can be placed on any of the following blocks:{{columns-list|* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}|style=column-count:2}}{{IN|bedrock}}, firefly bushes can be [[snowlogged]]. When snowlogged, a firefly bush doesn't emit particles nor ambient sounds.

=== Composting ===
Placing a firefly bush into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of firefly bushes drops an average of 2.74 [[bone meal]].

=== Ambient sounds ===
At night (between 12600 and 23400 ticks), a firefly bush emits firefly buzzing sounds if no collidable blocks (excluding [[leaves]]) are placed above it. A firefly bush may still produce firefly particles in a dark cave or an unlit space, without the bush emitting ambient sounds if it is daytime.
