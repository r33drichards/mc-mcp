'''1.18.30''' is a minor update to {{BE}} released on April 19, 2022, which added support for 64-bit [[world seed]]s, a new UI, [[Spectator]] mode, balanced the [[hunger]] system, fixed [[damage]], [[armor]], and [[protection]] calculations, and fixed bugs.<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/5520890863245|title=Minecraft - 1.18.30 (Bedrock)|website=feedback.minecraft.net|date=April 19, 2022}}</ref>

==Changes==
===Blocks===
'''[[Invisible Bedrock]]'''
* Block ID changed from <code>invisiblebedrock</code> to <code>invisible_bedrock</code>.
'''[[Piston Head]]s'''
* Block ID of Piston Head changed from <code>pistonarmcollision</code> to <code>piston_arm_collision</code>.
* Block ID of Sticky Piston Head changed from <code>stickypistonarmcollision</code> to <code>sticky_piston_arm_collision</code>.
'''[[Moving Block]]'''
* Block ID changed from <code>movingblock</code> to <code>moving_block</code>.

===Items===
'''[[Armor]]'''
* Added armor toughness to minimize the effects of the new armor penetration mechanics.
**Diamond armor and netherite armor now have a toughness value of 2 and 3 respectively.
**Netherite armor will now reduce more damage than diamond armor.
*Tweaked armor reduction calculation to account for toughness.
*Armor protects less due to the new penetration system. 
** Armor points count for less as the attack strength increases: each {{hp|2}} done by the attack reduces the effective defense points by {{armor|1}}, but not below 20% of the armor points. Each armor point now defends 0.8% to 4% instead of always 4%.
*Lowered the amount of knockback resistance granted by [[netherite]] armor. Each armor piece gives 10% of knockback reduction instead of 22.5%, so a full set reduces 40% of knockback instead of 90%.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-77430}}</ref><ref>[https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360051721352-Minecraft-Beta-1-16-200-53-Xbox-One-Windows-10-Android- Netherite Armor now gives a ninety percent reduction in Knockback since Minecraft Beta - 1.16.200.53 (Xbox One/Windows 10/Android)]</ref>

'''[[Hunger]]'''
*It is now possible to tweak the rate of hunger depletion with behavior packs ([[add-on]]s).

}}
'''[[Reinforced Deepslate]]'''
* A new block only found in [[Ancient City|ancient cities]].
* It is unobtainable in survival mode.
* Has some unknown "interesting" purpose.
* Currently can only be broken by mining, although after a very long time, and is immune to explosions.

==== Items ====
'''[[Boat with Chest]]'''
* Function similarly to [[minecart with chest]]s, but in boats instead, so player can take a journey on the water and carry things.
* Crafted by combining a [[chest]] with any [[boat]].

'''[[Copper Horn]]'''
* Crafted from a goat horn and copper ingots.
* Can play three different sounds, with additional sounds if the horn is crafted from a goat horn that is dropped by a screaming goat.

'''[[Spawn Egg]]s'''
* Added Allay and Warden spawn egg.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[Allay]]'''
* Can collect the same items from the world as it holds in its hand.
* If holds an item it got from a player, it will follow that player.
* Able to drop items at nearby [[note block]]s.
* When playing a note block near them, that note block becomes their favorite one for 30 seconds, and they will attempt to drop off items at the note block rather than at the player.
* If they have items in their inventory, they will attempt to give them to their owner.
* Sometimes spawn in cages next to [[pillager outpost]]s (similar to [[iron golem]]), and inside [[woodland mansion]]s.

'''[[Warden]]'''
* The first fully blind mob (bats have basic eyesight, both in-game and in the real world).
** Because of this, it stumbles as it walks.
** Has a sense of smell. It can detect and pathfind toward the general location of a player or mob through a "smelling" action.
*** Prioritizes smelling the player or mob that it is most suspicious of, rather than the one closest to it.
** Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it pathfinds toward the source of the movement.
*** It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.<ref group="note">The Warden does not attack non-mob entities but it does follow the vibrations that they make.</ref>
**** It does not attack other wardens.
*** When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to the [[sculk sensor]].
**** Seems to follow the same rules as the [[sculk sensor]] when detecting vibrations.
**** If any projectile (e.g. [[egg]], [[snowball]], [[arrow]]) lands near it, the warden inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating significant vibrations. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
*** Does not detect players that are sneaking.
** Can detect players or mobs that have the [[Invisibility]] effect.
* Becomes more suspicious of a player or mob as it detects its location more through vibrations and/or smelling. When it suspects the target enough, it identifies its exact location, which aggravates it, causing it to pathfind toward the target to attack regardless of outside distractions.
* Spawns in the deep dark biome, specifically when a player activates sculk shriekers three times.
** It is the only mob that spawns in the deep dark biome.
* "Emerges" from the ground when spawned by [[sculk shrieker]]s.
** Digs back into the ground when it doesn't sense any vibration after 60 seconds.
*** Like how [[name tags]] prevent despawning, name tags can also prevent wardens from being able to burrow back to the ground.
*** Wardens will not dig back when they're in water.
* A mob designed to be extremely difficult, intended to be avoided and fled from.
** Has {{hp|500}} health points and does {{hp|30}} damage on Normal difficulty, bringing players wearing full [[netherite]] [[armor]] from full health to {{hp|7}} health points. Wardens also disable shields when they hit the players with their fists, and are at least as fast as a walking player.
* Warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the Darkness effect.
** The core creates a low throbbing or "heartbeat" sound as it pulses. The sound and animation speed up rapidly as the warden gets more suspicious of or closer to attacking a player or mob.
* Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding the [[iron golem]] and [[enderman]] in height and width (the same).
** Wardens have long melee reach, being able to hit the player when on top of a four-block pillar, thus making it capable of countering certain cheese tactics, such as pillaring.
* Is immune to [[lava]] and can float up lava columns very fast.

==== World generation ====
'''[[Ancient City]]'''
* New structure that generates within the deep dark biome.
* Includes all of the deep dark features within it.
* Made of deepslate and its variants, basalt blocks and its variants, planks, and wool.
* Contains soul sand, soul fire and soul lanterns.
* Contains candles and skeleton skulls.
* Contains chests with unique loot.
** The loot is intended to be items that cannot be found anywhere else in the world, and that provide unique abilities and mechanics to players that weren't possible before and are not attainable by other methods.
* Contains mysterious frames made of reinforced deepslate.
* Has different levels and open spaces.
* Extremely large in terms of size, tends to spawn between y=0 and y=-64.

'''[[Deep Dark]]'''
* New [[biome]] at the "deepest depths of the world".
* Tends to generate under continental/mountainous areas, exclusively within the [[deepslate]] layer between Y=-1 and Y=-64.
* The floor is covered in [[sculk]] and contains all [[sculk]]-related blocks.
* With the exception of [[monster spawner]]s, no mobs other than wardens can spawn there, similar to [[mushroom field]]s.

==== Command format ====
'''{{cmd|volumearea}}'''
* Used to create, remove, and list volumes in the world.

=== Changes ===
==== Blocks ==== 
'''[[Frog Spawn]]'''
* Renamed from "Frog Egg".
* Texture was slightly changed.
* The time to hatch into tadpoles has been increased.
* Now breaks when pushed by a piston.
* Can now be placed on waterlogged blocks.

'''[[Froglight]]s'''
* No longer randomly rotate.
* Can now be placed sideways.
* [[File:Pearlescent Froglight BE2.png|32px]][[File:Verdant Froglight BE2.png|32px]][[File:Ochre Froglight BE2.png|32px]] Changed their textures.

'''[[Sculk Catalyst]]'''
* Made changes to match recent redesign:
** Blooms when mobs die within an 8-block radius.
** Mobs will not drop experiences when perished in the presence of the block, a bubbling charge will be created where they perished instead.
*** The charge from mobs will spread through sculk veins and sculk blocks in random directions until they find a valid substrate that they can convert into [[sculk]].
*** The value of the charge is directly proportional to the amount of experiences the perished mob would have dropped, and each time a block is converted into sculk, it will remove 1 value from that charge.
*** This charge in the sculk blocks and [[sculk veins]] will eventually decay, but it will decay much, much slower in the close vicinity of the sculk catalyst, and much faster away from its host.
*** If the charge decays 4 blocks away from the catalyst, it has a chance of growing a sculk sensor or a [[sculk shrieker]].
*** Charges and their values also merge when they move to the same position.

'''[[Sculk Sensor]]'''
* Made some changes in parity:
** Now make no activation sound when waterlogged.
** Vibrations are now also occluded by [[wool]] blocks.

'''[[Sculk Shrieker]]'''
* Now listens to the tendril clicking of the sculk sensor.
* The threat level that causes the warden to spawn (to be added in a future beta/preview) will now be decreased over time.

==== Items ====
'''[[Goat Horn]]s'''
* An animation is now shown when using the [[goat horn]] in both 1st and 3rd person views.
* Now have a cooldown period every time they are used.
* A sound now plays when a horn breaks off a goat.
* An animation is now shown when using the goat horn in both 1st and 3rd person views.
* Can now be crafted into copper horns
* Is now always dropped when a goat with at least one horn rams into stone, packed ice, iron ore, copper ore, emerald ore, or any wood log in the Overworld

==== Mobs ====
'''[[Frog]]'''
* Frogs now jump more frequently.
* Frogs in Meadow biomes are now of the temperate variant.
* Tweaked frog's jump and tongue animations.
* Can now be tempted and bred using [[slimeball]]s.
* Adjusted Frog spawning in [[Swamp|Swamps]], weight 10, herd size 2-5.

'''[[Goat]]'''
* A sound now plays when a [[goat horn]] breaks off.
* Now have a small chance of spawning with only one horn.
** Baby goats will always grow up to have two horns, however.

'''[[Tadpole]]'''
* Tadpole hitbox is now larger.
* Health is now {{hp|6}}, instead of {{hp|4}}.

==== World generation ====
'''[[Pillager Outpost]]'''
* Goat horns and copper horns now spawn as loot in pillager outpost chests.

==== Gameplay ====
