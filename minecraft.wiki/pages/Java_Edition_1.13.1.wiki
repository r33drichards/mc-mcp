'''1.13.1''' is a minor update to {{el|je}} released on August 22, 2018,<ref name="releasearticle">{{Mcnet|minecraft-1131-released|Minecraft 1.13.1 Released|August 22, 2018}}</ref> which adds dead [[coral]]s, a world list search bar, the {{cmd|forceload}} [[command]]; makes some changes to [[fish]] mobs, coral, [[squid]], and [[buckets of tropical fish]]; and fixes many bugs. It is not compatible with [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]] servers.

== Additions ==
{{Additions table
|Dead Tube Coral
|Dead Brain Coral
|Dead Bubble Coral
|Dead Fire Coral
|Dead Horn Coral
}}

=== Blocks ===
[[File:TNT JE2 BE1.png|width=32x32]]''' [[TNT|Unstable TNT]]'''
* Re-added punch-to-explode [[TNT]] using the <code>unstable</code> state (instead of the <code>explode</code> state before [[17w47a]]).

'''{{Animate|Dead Tube Coral JE1 BE1.png; Dead Brain Coral JE1 BE1.png; Dead Bubble Coral JE1 BE1.png; Dead Fire Coral JE1 BE1.png; Dead Horn Coral JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Dead Coral|Dead coral]]'''
* Dead variants of regular corals.
* Can be placed on top of blocks.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Statistics]]'''
* New statistics:<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/95m844/minecraft_snapshot_18w32a/e3ur1aj/ Reddit Comment] by developer [[Rockenroll4life]]</ref>
** Damage Dealt (Absorbed) – <code>damage_dealt_absorbed</code>
** Damage Dealt (Resisted) – <code>damage_dealt_resisted</code>
** Damage Blocked By Shield – <code>damage_blocked_by_shield</code>
** Damage Absorbed – <code>damage_absorbed</code>
** Damage Resisted – <code>damage_resisted</code>
** Shulker Box Cleaned – <code>clean_shulker_box</code>

=== General ===
* Added {{keys|Ctrl+F3+C}} to force a JVM crash, instead of a regular crash. However, with some keyboards it only triggers with right control.<ref>{{bug|MC-135509}}; per comments there, some keyboards do not allow pressing those keys at the same time (as they are in the same vertical column, presumably). http://keyboardchecker.com/ can be used to check.</ref>
* Added a search bar to the [[world]] list.
* Added a concept of force-loaded [[chunk]]s to the game, and a [[command]] ({{cmd|forceload}}) to toggle force-loading on and off.
* Added the block [[tag]] <code>minecraft:underwater_bonemeals</code>.
* The [[Debug screen|F3 debug screen]] now displays the dimension the [[player]] is in, just above the XYZ coordinates.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Conduit (closed core).gif|width=42x42]] '''[[Conduit]]s'''
* Are now properly waterlogged.
{{Animate|Tube Coral JE1 BE1.png;Brain Coral JE1 BE1.png;Bubble Coral JE1 BE1.png;Fire Coral JE2 BE1.png;Horn Coral JE1 BE1.png|32px}} '''[[Coral]]'''
* Can now be placed in air.
** Unless adjacent to [[water]] or waterlogged blocks, they turn into dead [[coral]] after a short amount of time.
{{Animate|Purpur Stairs (N) JE1 BE1.png;Purpur Slab JE1 BE1.png|32px}} '''[[Purpur Stairs]] and [[Purpur Slab|Slabs]]'''
* Can now be crafted using [[purpur pillar]]s.

=== Items ===
[[File:Bone Meal JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Bone Meal]]'''
* When used underwater in [[warm ocean]] biome, it now has a chance to grow [[coral]]s and [[coral fan]]s.
[[File:Bucket of Tropical Fish JE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Bucket of Tropical Fish]]'''
* Added tooltips.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Salmon.gif|width=47x47]] '''[[Salmon]]'''
* Now have a 5% chance of dropping [[bone meal]] when killed.
[[File:Squid JE1 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Squid]]'''
* Now spawn only in [[river]]s, [[ocean]]s or [[beach]]es.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Scoreboard]]s'''
* The [[Scoreboard#Players commands|scoreboard]] operator <code>%=</code> was changed from using Java's native <code>%</code> to using <code>Math.floorMod</code>. This causes the operator to use floored [[wikipedia:Modulo operation|modulo]] instead of truncated modulo, so now <code>-1 % 7</code> wraps to 6 instead of returning -1.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/93pmai/minecraft_snapshot_18w31a/e3fkwrj</ref>

'''Functions'''
* Line numbers in [[Function (Java Edition)|function]] parse error logs now start with 1 (was 0).

=== General ===
'''Performance'''
* Performance has been optimized.
* Improved the performance of [[liquid]]s.
* Improved the performance of flowing liquids.
* Improved the performance of rendering [[chunk]]s.
* Improved the performance of spawning [[mob]]s.
