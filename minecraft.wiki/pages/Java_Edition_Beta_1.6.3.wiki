'''Beta 1.6.3''' is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]] released on May 26, 2011,<ref>{{twon|5864594578|Minecraft Beta 1.6.3|May 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|Notch|73741213769011200|Minecraft Beta 1.6.3 is out, fixing even more stuff!|May 26, 2011}}</ref> which fixes some of the bugs and crashes in [[Beta 1.6.2]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Water JE10.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Water that is 2 blocks deep no longer prevents fall damage.
** Players need at least 3-block-deep water to prevent fall damage.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* The renderer is now capped at 100 fps while there are chunks to be generated. The excess time will be spent generating chunks instead of rendering frames.
* The "limit framerate" option now limits the game to 40 fps and will spend at least 10 ms per frame sleeping.
* The "limit framerate" option has been reset to "off" for all players, enable it again if wanted.

== Fixes ==
'''3 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed some block updates not updating [[light]]ing properly under some circumstances by reverting the fix in 1.6 that lead to block data not always being sent.
* Fixed a major CPU load issue in the server where a very tight loop would starve all other threads.
* Fixed [[furnace]]s dropping/duplicating their contents when they change state from lit to unlit or back.
