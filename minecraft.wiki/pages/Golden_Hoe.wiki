A '''golden hoe''' is a variant of [[hoe]] that is crafted from [[gold ingot]]s. It is used to [[till]] [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks into [[farmland]], and to break [[leaves]], [[haybale]]s, and [[Sculk family|sculk-related]] blocks faster. It is the sixth-highest [[tier]] of hoe, having the lowest durability, and having the lowest attack speed alongside [[wooden hoe]]s, despite having the highest [[mining efficiency]]. It can be [[Piglin#Piglin loved items|admired]] by piglins, and has the highest [[enchantability]].

== Usage ==
{{Main|Hoe#Usage}}

=== Harvesting ===
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 [[durability]].

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.

=== Tilling ===
Hoes are used to turn [[dirt]], [[grass block]]s, and [[dirt path]]s into [[farmland]]. To till, press {{control|use}} on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]],<ref>{{bug|MC-8231||Mycelium and podzol cannot be tilled with hoes}}</ref> nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including [[snow]] or [[torch]]es. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a [[shovel]], then tilled into farmland with a hoe.

Hoes can be used to convert [[coarse dirt]] into regular dirt by pressing {{control|use}} on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.

Hoes can also be used on [[rooted dirt]], which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a [[hanging roots]] item.

Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.

Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.<ref>{{bug|MC-167846||Hoe cannot be used on blocks with certain blocks on top even if said blocks can normally exist on farmland|WAI}}</ref>

=== Weapon ===
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only {{hp|1}} damage {{in|java}}. {{IN|bedrock}}, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.

{{IN|java}}, golden hoes have an attack speed modifier -3 (refill in 1s).

Hoes always attack instantly {{in|bedrock}}.

A golden hoe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[gold ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 8 durability (25% of its maximum durability, rounded down). Two golden hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A hoe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Tilling a [[dirt]] block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to [[farmland]] even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a [[block]] horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
* When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.
