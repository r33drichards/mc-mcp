{{outdated}}

In [[Village & Pillage]], trading was significantly revamped. This page is about villager_v1 trading {{in|bedrock|lc=}}, or before [[Java Edition 1.14]] was released.

== Differences ==
* Different lists of trades were available.
* The trading interface was very different.
* [[Villager|Villagers]] unlocked new trade tiers when they make a trade they have never made before, rather than based on experience.
** Not all careers had 5 tiers.
** Tiers were not displayed in the trading GUI nor on their textures.
* Villagers resupplied trades randomly when other trades were made, and they did not have workstations.
* Careers were fixed and were assigned when a villager spawned.
* Not every career had a unique texture.{{only|java}}
* Trade prices were determined when the trade was unlocked, and did not change.
* Villagers did not display items available for trade in their hands.
* Villagers lost their trades when becoming a [[Zombie Villager]].
* [[Wandering Trader]]s, Masons{{only|java}} and Unemployed Villagers were not yet added.

== Mechanics ==
Pressing use on an adult villager would open a GUI allowing a player to trade with the villager. Villagers would make offers based on their profession and career, and would only make trades based on what offers they were making. Different offers could be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer. All offers involved [[emerald]] as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's career.

[[File:Trading paper clean GUI.png|thumb|200px|left|The old trading interface, displaying a trade of 28 [[paper]] for 1 [[emerald]].]]

Careers were assigned to each villager as they spawned, with multiple careers being part of the same profession, and sharing textures. For example, brown-robed villagers could be fletchers or fishermen and blacksmiths could be armorers or weaponsmiths. These careers were viewable in the trading GUI, but the villager's level was not. Every villager spawned at tier 1 of their given career, which ranged from 2–4 initial unlocked trades (i.e. all shepherds spawned with only two options, buying wool and selling shears). Each tier consisted of a defined set of trade offers, and the tiers were the same for any given career (see the chart below). They could unlock new tiers when an existing offer was traded. Note that the trading GUI had to be closed before a villager would unlock a new tier. When they did, they would receive Regeneration I and become surrounded with purple and green particles for a few seconds. Each career had a fixed sequence of tiers, and would only unlock a finite number of offers.

Villagers would deactivate an offer if the offer had been used some number of times. The chance of an offer's deactivation was random, but an offer had to be used at least 2 times before it was eligible for deactivation. After an offer had been used 12 times, it was guaranteed to be deactivated. Trading a different offer would sometimes activate an offer again. When an offer was disabled, a red X would appear in the trading interface, and it had the same particle effect as an offer being created.

An offer was guaranteed to reactivate available deactivated options (and unlock a tier, if some had not yet been unlocked) the ''first'' time it was traded. On subsequent trades, it would only have a 20% chance of doing so, per trade. For example, if a farmer villager had a trade of 8 [[pumpkin]]s for 1 [[emerald]], and the player traded a stack of 64 pumpkins, this would count as 8 attempts with each attempt having a 20% chance to reactivate the villager's trades, and come to about 83.2% chance of reactivation (1 - 1/0.8<sup>8</sup>).

Villagers would distinguish between data values, so different colors of [[wool]] ''could not'' replace white wool, charcoal could not be traded in place of [[coal]], and damaged [[tools]] could not be traded in place of fully repaired tools{{only|bedrock}}. [[NBT]] data, however, was ignored, so the content of a [[written book]] did not matter.

{{IN|je}}, all trades rewarded the player with 3–6 [[experience]], or 8–11 experience if the villager was in a state where it is willing to [[breed]]. [[Category:Java Edition specific information]] This was also true in Bedrock editions, except that certain trades didn't reward any experience: the first-tier trades of a Farmer, the [[rotten flesh]] trade of a Cleric, the [[porkchop]] trade of a Butcher, or the [[string]] trade of a Fletcher.[[Category:Bedrock Edition specific information]]
