'''Diorite''' is a [[block]] of igneous [[rock]], found in [[ore (feature)|large pockets]] in the ground.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Diorite can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If broken without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Diorite|Pickaxe|Wood|link=none}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
Diorite can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, diorite attempts to generate in two batches in all biomes in the Overworld. The first batch generates 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-864, from elevations 0 to 60. The second batch has {{frac|1|6}} chance to generate blobs of size 0-864, from elevation 64 to 128. {{IN|BE}}, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, polished andesite, polished diorite, and polished granite. {{IN|JE}}, diorite can replace stone, andesite, granite, tuff, and deepslate.

Diorite generates in weaponsmith houses, tannery houses, and mason houses in [[village|snowy village]]s.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, diorite generates in [[coral reef]]s, replacing some [[block]]s of [[coral]] crust.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Diorite}}

== Trivia ==
* In the real world, {{w|diorite}} comes from underground {{w|magma chamber}}s that turned cold. Diorite usually has a salt & pepper appearance.
** {{w|Andesite}} is diorite's above-ground equivalent: The two rocks come from the same kind of {{w|magma}}, but andesite forms in {{w|lava flow}}s. Its fast cooling is what makes it look smoother than diorite.
** {{w|Granite}} is another magma chamber rock, but it's made of more quartz crystals. That is why in ''Minecraft'', granite can be crafted by combining diorite and [[nether quartz]].
* In the real world, diorite is an extremely hard rock and is difficult to carve and work with.
* In ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'', Reuben's grave on Episode 4 is made out of diorite and a new stair variant of it which cannot be found in ''[[Minecraft]]'' until the [[Village & Pillage]] update, which was announced roughly 3 years after Episode 4. It is unknown whether diorite slabs are present.
