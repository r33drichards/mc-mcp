'''Soul campfires''' are dimmer variants of [[campfires]]. Soul campfires deal more damage than normal campfires and have turquoise flames. Just like normal campfires, they can be used to cook [[food]], pacify [[bee]]s, or act as a spread-proof [[light source]], smoke signal, or damaging trap block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Soul campfires can be mined with any tool, or without a tool, but [[axe]]s are the fastest. A soul campfire drops [[soul soil]], as well as any items currently cooking on it. If mined with a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], the soul campfire instead drops itself as an item.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, a soul campfire can also be broken by pushing it with a [[piston]] or [[sticky piston]]. Pistons cannot move or break soul campfires {{in|Java}}.

== Usage ==
Lit soul campfires emit a light level of 10.

Soul campfires are lit by default when placed. Soul campfires can be manually lit by {{control|using}} or [[Dispenser|dispensing]] [[flint and steel]] on them, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing [[fire charge]]s, [[blaze]] fireballs, and [[ghast]] fireballs when {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is true. {{IN|bedrock}}, soul campfires can also be lit by {{control|using}} an item enchanted with [[Fire Aspect]], or stepping on it while burning. 

Soul campfires can be extinguished by [[waterlogging]] it (placing [[water]] in the same block space), throwing a [[splash water bottle]] on it, or {{control|using}} a [[shovel]] on it. Soul campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face.{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-262205||Campfires can't be extinguished on the bottom face|WAI}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, soul campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the soul campfire. As with [[torch]]es, rain does not extinguish soul campfires.<ref>{{bug|MC-141920||Rain doesn't put out campfire|Works as Intended}}</ref>

Using [[flint and steel]] on the side of a waterlogged or lit soul campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead.

Any items cooking on a soul campfire always drop when the soul campfire block is broken.

=== Particles and smoke signals ===
Unlike regular [[campfire]]s, soul campfires do not emit embers.<ref>{{bug|MC-185482||Soul campfires do not emit ember particles|Works as Intended}}</ref>

=== Damage ===
Soul campfires damage [[mob]]s standing on top of them even if underwater (with exceptions such as [[shulker]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, or [[guardian]]s), but only if lit. Soul campfires deal {{hp|2}} of damage every tick (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second). Soul campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is considered [[Damage#Fire|fire damage]], so it is not reduced by [[armor]] itself; to do so, the player needs the [[Resistance]] effect, or the [[Protection]] or [[Fire Protection]] enchantments. The player can also avoid all damage from the campfire by either using a [[potion of Fire Resistance]] or wearing [[Frost Walker]] boots.

Regardless of [[Solid block#Height|height]], all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above soul campfires. The soul campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.

=== Cooking ===
{{Main|Campfire#Cooking}}

=== Hoppers ===
Soul campfires do not have an [[Inventory#External inventories|external inventory]]. Raw food cannot be loaded into the soul campfire with a [[hopper]].

A hopper placed directly underneath a soul campfire pulls through any items dropped into the soul campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the soul campfire get pulled into the hopper.

=== Bees ===
Placing a soul campfire under a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]] allows players to harvest [[honey bottle]]s or [[honeycomb]] without provoking the [[bee]]s.
There must be unobstructed air between the soul campfire and the beehive or bee nest. [[Carpet]]s are an exception.{{only|JE}}

=== Piglins ===
Lit soul campfires repel [[piglin]]s that are not currently attacking. This occurs when the piglin is within an 8-block radius of the soul campfire. [[Piglin brute]]s are not repelled by soul campfires.

=== Light source ===
Soul campfires emit a light level of 10. Due to their lower light level, soul campfires do not melt snow or ice.

=== Note blocks ===
Soul campfires can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.

=== Converting soul sand to soul soil ===
Soul campfires can be used to convert [[soul sand]] into [[soul soil]]. If a soul campfire is crafted using soul sand, placed, and then broken without [[Silk Touch]], that soul campfire drops soul soil.<ref>{{bug|MC-178579||Soul campfires can be used to convert soul sand into soul soil|Works as Intended}}</ref>

=== Piston interactivity ===
{{IN|Bedrock}}, pushing a soul campfire with a [[piston]] or [[sticky piston]] breaks it. Soul campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.

{{IN|Java}}, pistons do not interact with soul campfires. Soul campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.
