[[File:1-18-ore-distribution.jpg|thumb|right|Ore distribution changes]]
* Major overhaul of terrain and [[cave]] generation, with a new expanded [[world height]] from top to bottom.
* Biomes can now be generated in 3D, with different biomes depending now on y-level.
** Caves are now composed of two layers depending on depth.
*** A stone layer, found in y-levels above 0.
*** A deepslate layer, found in y-levels below 8.
** [[Aquifers]], or bodies of water, generate deep underground, independent of sea level at Y=63.
** Caves now come in three noise generations: "cheese", "spaghetti", and "noodle".
*** Cheese caves are large sprawling caves with stone pillars from top to bottom, and allows for elytra flight.
*** Spaghetti caves are long, thin caves with smaller aquifers.
*** Noodle caves are thinner, and smaller compared to spaghetti caves.
** Ore generation has changed.
*** [[Coal ore]] now tries to generate twice, evenly between Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread between Y=0 to Y=192 with a peak at Y=96.
*** [[Copper ore]] generates as a spread between Y=-16 and Y=112 with a peak at Y=48.
*** [[Iron ore]] now tries to generate three times, as a spread above Y=80 with a peak at Y=256; another spread between Y=-24 to Y=57 with a peak at Y=16; and a small even distribution between Y=-64 and Y=-32.
*** [[Gold ore]] now generates between Y=-64 and Y=32 with a peak at Y=-16. Extra gold can also generate below Y=-48.
**** In [[badland]]s, gold now generates from Y=79 to Y=256 with an increase number of blobs.
*** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] now tries to generate twice, as a spread between Y=-32 and Y=32 with a peak at Y=0; and unexposed evenly between Y=-64 and Y=64.
*** [[Redstone ore]] now tries to generate twice, evenly between Y=16 and Y=-64; and as a spread below Y=-32 with a peak at Y=-64
*** [[Diamond ore]] now generates as a spread, generating below Y=16 and peaking at Y=-64.
*** [[Emerald ore]] generates above Y=-16 and peaks at Y=256, decreasing in quantity as the altitude decreases.
** Upgrading worlds before this update now blend chunk boundaries from old chunks to new chunks seemlessly.
*** The bedrock layer for older worlds is converted to deepslate.

{{Q|Go underwater to team up with the axolotl and meet the glow squid. Tread carefully on higher ground because the goats might ram you!|[[minecraft.net]]|Caves & Cliffs: Part I}}
{{Q|Explore bigger mountains, caves, and biomes along with an increased world height and updated terrain generation in the Caves & Cliffs Update.|[[minecraft.net]]|Caves & Cliffs: Part II}}

== Trivia ==
* [[Mojang Studios]] employees explored real caves to research for the update. This helped give inspiration and ideas for the update, including for the noodle caves (previously called mesh caves).<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1319472424115724289|Yes, and yes. Was hoping to do a larger field trip to different countries with interesting caves, but covid got in the way so we had stay more local.|October 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1318946383680995349|Mesh caves were inspired by this field trip.|October 21, 2020}}</ref>
** [[Henrik Kniberg]] also recalled memories of past visits to caves around the world.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1319473892327645184|I used to travel a lot in the past though (before becoming aware of climate change), and I like visiting caves, so I dug up memories from fascinating cave visits in Spain, South Africa, New Zealand, and British Virgin Isles and some other places.|October 23, 2020}}</ref>
* The art style of the concept art for Caves & Cliffs was inspired by the concept art of the ''[[Adventure Time]]'' episode ''[[Diamonds and Lemons]]'', which was a crossover with {{MC}}.<ref>{{tweet|cookiecat_9|1312675314267566080|Definitely one of my biggest inspirations! My favorite show + favorite game - it shaped a lot how I approached concepts for Minecraft artstyle|October 4, 2020}}</ref>
* [[Archaeology]], [[bundle]]s, the [[deep dark]] biome, [[sculk family|sculk]] blocks, the [[warden]], and [[goat horn]]s were originally planned to be added in this update, but were delayed to a later version when the update was split. Sculk, the deep dark, the warden, and goat horns were added in [[The Wild Update]], archaeology was added in the [[Trails & Tales]] update, and bundles were added in the [[Bundles of Bravery]] drop.<ref>{{ytl|6YgKUZnUyak|A Caves & Cliffs Announcement|Minecraft|April 14, 2021|t=286}}</ref>

'''Trailer trivia'''
* At the [https://youtu.be/0maWbr0FHKY?t=24 0:24] mark of the Caves & Cliffs: Part I trailer, the {{w|Capricornus}} constellation can be spotted in the sky, which represents the sea-goat and is the Latin name for the [[goat horn]].
* In the same trailer at [https://youtu.be/0maWbr0FHKY?t=30 0:30], a [[MCD:Necromancer|Necromancer]] laugh from ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' can be heard.
