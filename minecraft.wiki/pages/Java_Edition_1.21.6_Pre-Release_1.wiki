== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tags]]'''
* Added the {{cd|#quick_actions}} dialog tag.
** Dialogs to open when pressing {{control|quick actions}}.

== Changes ==
===Blocks===
'''[[Dried ghast]]'''
* The dried ghast now emits a vibration frequency of 11 from the [[sculk sensor]] when its block state changes.
* The ambient dried ghast sounds are now adjusted under the Blocks sound option instead of the Ambient/Environment option.

'''[[Carpet]]'''
* Shearing carpets for [[llama]]s now emits a vibration frequency of 6, while unequipping it emits a vibration frequency of 4 from the [[sculk sensor]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Saddle]]'''
* Shearing saddles now emits a vibration frequency of 6, while unequipping it emits a vibration frequency of 4 from the [[sculk sensor]].

''' [[Horse armor]]'''
* Shearing horse armor now emits a vibration frequency of 6, while unequipping it emits a vibration frequency of 4 from the [[sculk sensor]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Happy ghast]]'''
* A player riding a happy ghast can no longer completely fly through a happy ghast ridden by another player.

=== General ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* A new keybind called "Quick Actions" has been added to allow users to access a set of content-configured dialogs.
** Default key: {{Key|G}}
** This feature is configured by {{cd|minecraft:quick_actions}} dialog tag.
*** If this tag is empty, the keybind does nothing.
*** If this tag has a single element, the keybind will open this dialog.
*** If this tag has multiple elements, the keybind will lead to {{cd|minecraft:quick_actions}} dialog which (by default) lets user select one of the tag elements.
*** If this dialog is removed, the keybind does nothing.
** This option is intended to be used in custom content and by servers, so this tag is empty by default.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|79}}.
* The {{cd|minecraft:custom}} click event has been expanded to carry full a NBT tag.

'''[[Dialog]]s'''
* Dialogs can now configure if they pause the game and if they close after an action is taken.
* Every dialog can now have inputs and can submit information.
** The definition of actions has been changed to accommodate that.
** The dedicated input dialog types have been removed, since they are redundant now.
** The order of elements is:
*** Body
*** Inputs
*** Actions

* Common Dialog fields
** New fields:
*** {{cd|pause}} - if the dialog screen should pause the game in single-player mode, default: {{cd|true}}.
*** {{cd|after_action}} - an additional operation performed on the dialog after click or submit actions, default: {{cd|close}}.
**** {{cd|close}} - closes the dialog and returns to the previous non-dialog screen (if any).
**** {{cd|none}} - does nothing, i.e. keeps the current dialog screen open.
***** Only available if pause is false to avoid locking the game in single-player mode.
**** {{cd|wait_for_response}} - replace the current dialog with a "Waiting for Response" screen.
***** Servers are expected to eventually replace this screen with a new dialog.
***** To avoid accidental locking, a "Back" button will become active after 5 seconds.
****** Clicking this button will continue as if the dialog was closed (i.e. the game returns to the previous non-dialog screen, if any).
***** The "Waiting for Response" screen will unpause the game in single-player mode to avoid locking the game.

* Dialog Types
** {{cd|minecraft:multi_action}}, {{cd|minecraft:server_links}}, {{cd|minecraft:dialog_list}}
*** Replaced field {{cd|on_cancel}} with {{cd|exit_action}}, holding an optional action.
**** If {{cd|exit_action}} is present, a button for it will appear in footer, otherwise the footer is not present.
**** {{cd|exit_action}} is also used for the Escape action.
** Removed {{cd|minecraft:simple_input_form}}.
*** Since any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by {{cd|minecraft:notice}}.
** Removed {{cd|minecraft:multi_action_input_form}}.
*** Since any dialog can now have inputs, this dialog can be replaced by {{cd|minecraft:multi_action}} (without any specified {{cd|exit_action}}).

* Input Control Types
** {{cd|minecraft:custom}} click event, all inputs will now return either a string or an NBT tag, depending on context.
** {{cd|minecraft:text}}
*** Output values:
**** As template substitution: contents without modification.
**** As tag: a string tag with contents without modification.
** {{cd|minecraft:boolean}}
*** Output values:
**** As template substitution: {{cd|on_true}} when checked, {{cd|on_false}} when unchecked.
**** As tag: 1b when checked, 0b when unchecked.
** {{cd|minecraft:number_range}}
*** Output values:
**** As template substitution: text representation of current value.
***** Whole numbers will be sent without decimal point.
**** As tag: a float tag with current value.

* Dialog Body Types
** Hover and click events on text components within bodies now work as expected.
*** Click events are handled by the dialog screen like any other action - that means it will also run the {{cd|after_action}}.

* Actions
** The format of actions has been changed due to the merging of plain and input dialogs.
** After every action the dialog will always evaluate the contents of the {{cd|after_action}} field (see above).
** Fields:
*** Kept fields: {{cd|label}}, {{cd|tooltip}}, {{cd|width}}
**** New field: {{cd|action}} (replaces {{cd|on_click}} and {{cd|on_submit}}) - an action to perform when button is clicked, optional object with fields:
**** {{cd|<type-specific>}} - see below, depends on type

* Action Types
** Static Dialog 
*** All existing {{cd|click_event}} actions (except for {{cd|open_file}}) are included as dialog action types.
*** Uses same format as {{cd|click_event}} on text components (but with action replaced with type). For example, when using {{cd|show_dialog}}, entry for action button will look like:
<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
 "label": "some label",
 "action": {
  "type": "show_dialog",
  "dialog": "some:id"
 }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
** {{cd|minecraft:dynamic/run_command}}
*** This action will build a run_command event using a provided macro template.
*** The macro will be expanded with string values from all inputs.
**** For example, if the macro template is {{cd|some_command $(some_input)}}, the string value from the input with {{cd|key}} of {{cd|some_input}} will be used for the template expansion.
**** Inputs not used in macro will be ignored, while macro parameters not matching any inputs will be replaced with an empty string.
*** Fields:
**** {{cd|template}} - a string with a macro template to be interpreted as a command.
** {{cd|minecraft:dynamic/custom}}
*** This method will build a {{cd|minecraft:custom}} event using all input values.
*** All input contents will be sent together inside a compound tag, with tag value of each input put under id from {{cd|key}} field of that input.
*** Additional static fields can be added to payload.
*** Fields:
**** {{cd|additions}} - fields to be added to payload, optional compound tag.
**** {{cd|id}} - namespaced ID.

'''[[Item model]]s'''
* Item model definitions now have a boolean field {{cd|oversized_in_gui}} which is false by default
** If true, the item model will be allowed to be bigger than its item slot
** If false, the item model will be clipped to the item slot size when being rendered in GUI
** This ability of items being rendered outside their slots should not be considered officially supported, it was temporarily restored as an exception since many servers are relying on it
** At some point in the future it is meant to be replaced with an officially supported way of achieving similar functionality
* Introduced new item model {{cd|minecraft:player_head}} to handle player profile texture loading and rendering
* Removed support for {{cd|minecraft:profile}} from {{cd|minecraft:head}}
* {{cd|minecraft:player_head}} special model type
** Renders a player head.
** Uses profile from the {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component to load a texture. Renders a default texture until the profile texture is fully loaded.
** No fields.
* {{cd|minecraft:head}} special model type
** No longer supports profile from {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component to load a player texture.
** Renders a default player texture when {{cd|kind}} is {{cd|player}} and no texture override is supplied.
** Fields remain unchanged.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|63}}.
* Added {{cd|oversized_in_gui}} item model field.
* Introduced new player head special model <code>type.Minecraft</code>.
