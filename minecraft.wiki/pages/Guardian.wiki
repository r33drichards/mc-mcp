'''Guardians''' are [[aquatic]] [[hostile mob]]s that spawn in and around [[ocean monument]]s. They attack with a slow-charging laser beam, and [[Thorns|inflict retaliatory damage]] when damaged by a melee attack.

== Spawning ==
Guardians spawn naturally in [[ocean monument]]s. They require [[water]], flowing or stationary, to spawn. 

{{IN|java}} guardians spawn less often in [[ocean]] open to the [[sky]] than they do in covered areas (such as inside or underneath the monument). Specifically, spawning fails 95% of the time if the spawning water block is below sea level (Y=63 by default), all blocks between the spawning water block and sea level are [[liquid]] or fully transparent, and the block at sea level has a view of the sky. They can spawn only if the spawning [[block]] and the block below the spawning block are both water. The block above the spawning block also cannot be solid and has to be transparent, air, or water. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, guardians are structure spawns, spawning in water source blocks in 25 pre-determined spawning columns. Guardians usually do not (or possibly never) spawn near a player. Also, guardians seem not to spawn below solid blocks such as the prismarine blocks of the monument unless there are no water source blocks available above the solid blocks. This means that guardians don't spawn inside an ocean monument until most or all of the spawning column blocks above it are unavailable (i.e., no longer water source blocks). Guardians can spawn between Y=39–61 (inclusive, from the monument floor to one block above its highest point). To find the X and Z coordinates of the columns, start counting from the northwest corner of the monument. That is, standing on the furthest corner prismarine block with the smallest X and Z coordinates, let's say (X, 41, Z). The coordinates of each spawning spot are in a grid at X+2, X+13, X+29, X+45, and X+55, combined with Z+2, Z+13, Z+29, Z+45, and Z+55. For example, the bottom of the most northwest column is at (X+2, 39, Z+2) and the top block belonging to the southeast corner column is at (X+55, 61, Z+55). The guardians spawn at the northwest corner of a spawning column block, which can be helpful for some guardian farming mechanics such as causing them to spawn inside of a portal where they are immediately sent to the nether.

Guardians still spawn even if the monument has been destroyed by the player.

== Drops ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Guardian farming|title1=Guardian farming}}
Due to {{bug|MCPE-57215}}, the guardian won't drop random fish {{in|bedrock}}.

== Behavior ==
Guardians swim around in [[water]], attacking any [[player]]s, [[squid]], [[glow squid]], or [[axolotl]]s that come into range of its laser. They swim in abrupt charges, moving their tail rapidly when doing so. When swimming, their spikes retract. When not swimming, they sink slowly and their spikes extend and quiver.

During idle swimming, a guardian chooses a water or waterlogged block within a 9×9×9 area centered on itself as the destination to pathfind toward. If unreachable, they still swim directly toward the target despite any blocks in the way. They attempt to cross air blocks and do not try to prevent fall damage.

Stationary guardians are pushed much faster horizontally by flowing water than other mobs, but when swimming they are completely unimpeded; however, they are affected by [[bubble column]]s.

When swimming, guardians have a slight bias toward selecting destination blocks with a higher light level. If undisturbed, guardians can be seen loosely congregating around the [[sea lantern]] blocks of their ocean structure.

When out of water, they abandon any previous pathfinding target; they squeak loudly and hop erratically, uninfluenced by nearby water or players. They still use their laser and have their spikes extended. Guardians do not suffocate and survive indefinitely without water unlike other aquatic mobs.

The guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players, and always looks directly at its target. {{IN|JE}}, the eye does not follow unarmored players under the effects of a [[potion of Invisibility]] and the guardians cannot attack them. A player can wear one piece of [[armor]] while under the effects of Invisibility and not be attacked.

Guardians, as aquatic mobs, are affected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment.{{only|java|short=1}}

=== Combat ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Combat#Guardians}}

Guardians have two methods of attack: a laser and a defensive attack analogous to the [[Thorns]] enchantment. Unlike most other hostile mobs, a guardian does not follow a player who moves out of sight. Instead, it simply continues swimming until the player becomes visible again to start charging its laser.

Guardians attack players, axolotls, and squid. Otherwise, a guardian does not retaliate against mobs (such as iron golems) that attack it, other than damaging the attacking mob with its natural thorns defense.

;Laser

The laser takes 2 seconds to charge, causing no damage in the meantime. It starts out purple and fades to yellow. Once charged, the laser flashes green before disappearing and deals {{hp|6}} damage. Guardians swim around for 3 seconds before firing again. If the target approaches while the guardian is loading its laser, it stops firing and swims away until it is at a comfortable range, at which point it continues attacking. The laser has a maximum range of 15 blocks and cannot be dodged. However, a [[shield]] reduces its damage by 50%.

Once the target is out of range, or if the laser is obstructed by solid blocks (including transparent blocks like glass), the guardian's laser disengages and the shooting sound stops.

;Spikes defense

A guardian deals damage each time it is hit with a melee attack while its spikes are extended, similar to the [[Thorns]] armor enchantment. If cornered, a guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at the player, even at point-blank range.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* A guardian's eye is actually the "head" part of the mob's [[model]]. This gives the illusion of a dynamic eye.
* Guardians' laser-beam attacks are affected by the [[potion of Strength]], which normally affects only melee attacks.
* When placed or spawned on a [[slime block]], guardians start bouncing and continue and each bounce higher than the last, until each bounce brings the guardian to 17 [[block]]s height.
* In the texture file for the guardian, "jeb" is written in the bottom right corner.
* Despite being classified as only a [[monster]], the guardian was referred to as an [[animal]] in a ''Minecraft'' video about the [[elder guardian]]s.<ref>{{ytl|gs-rMm5luB8|Why are their eyes so big? <nowiki>|</nowiki> The Story Of The Elder Guardian|Minecraft|August 24, 2025|t=64s}}</ref>
