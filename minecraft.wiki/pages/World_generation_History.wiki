==Legacy Console Edition==
{{Incomplete section|Legacy Console Edition terrain changes}}
Legacy Console Edition was historically updated roughly following Java Edition major releases, and as such, mirrored Java Edition changes for much of its update history.

=== Overworld ===
====Beta terrain generator====
Xbox 360 edition was released with features roughly equivalent to Java Edition Beta 1.6, and therefore matched its terrain generation identically.
{{HistoryTable

|{{HistoryLine||xbox=TU1|'''''World generation is equivalent to [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]]'''''<br>First release with features and terrain generation roughly equivalent to Java Edition Beta 1.6

|{{HistoryLine||xbox=TU3|'''''World generation is equivalent to [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3]]'''''<br>Added a seed display to the level load screen (requires existing levels to be saved out again to add the display).
|Clay generation has been fixed and no longer exclusively spawns when x and z are equal.{{Info needed}}}}
}}

====Adventure Update terrain generator====
Xbox 360 version TU5 released features identical to Java Edition Beta 1.8, and therefore, all seeds have changed. The addition of Jungle biomes in TU12 shuffled positions of all major land biomes, changing a decent portion of world seeds again on Xbox 360. All other console editions except for Nintento Switch edition were initially released with the latter world generation.

====The Update That Changed The World terrain generator====
Nintendo Switch edition was the only Legacy Console Edition to be initially released during this world generation's stage.

|Added ocean monuments
|Added biomes: Mesa, Mega Taiga, Roofed Forest, Birch Forest, Forest, Savanna, Extreme Hills+, Deep Ocean, Snowless Taiga, and 20 new technical biomes.
|Melons can now be found in jungle biomes similar to pumpkins.
|Swamp biomes now spawn with blue orchid flowers and the coast is covered in staggered dirt block with lily pads between them.
|Plains biomes now generate with azure bluets, oxeye daises, tulips and double tall grass.
|Extreme hills biomes now have snow at higher elevations, gravel, flat valleys near sea level and are slightly higher. Extreme Hills Edge biomes no longer naturally generate.
|Ocean biomes contains only gravel on the floor instead of sand, dirt and gravel.
|Desert temples now spawn with stained clay instead of dyed wool.
|Due to limited world sizes, biomes are now downscaled 4x (16x area) in order to fit more biomes in each world (all world sizes). This differs from the "Biome Size 2" configuration in ''Java Edition'' [[Old Customized]] world type in that the 4x size downscaling occurs before hill biomes, edge biomes, and beach/shore are applied, not after like on ''Java''.

=== Indev world types ===
* Island: World spawns as a large island surrounded with water, smaller island off the coast are comon too. Border block is water as well, sand generates.
* Floating: World generates in rings of floating islands high in the air. Border block is water. Sand is common although caves often lead into the void. 
* Flat: world is a perfectly flat plane with trees growing. Border block is grass. Sand does not generate.
* Original: Resembles classic 0.30 terrain generation
* Inland:
