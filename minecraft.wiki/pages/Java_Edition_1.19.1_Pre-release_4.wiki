'''1.19.1 Pre-release 4''' (known as '''1.19.1-pre4''' in the launcher) is the fourth pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.19.1]], released on July 8, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-19-1-pre-release-3|Minecraft 1.19.1 Pre-Release 4|July 8, 2022}}</ref> which makes tweaks to chats, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Insecure chat messages logged in the server are prefixed with a <code>[Not Secure]</code> tag.
* The order of chat messages are now cryptographically verified.
** This is used for validating the context of chat messages for player reports.

'''Protocol'''
* Custom servers can hide player chat messages from display via a new network packet.
** This does not delete player chat messages from chat logs.
