{{Expand section}}
Evan is consistently shown to be very close with Tyler, arguably closer than any of their other friends.

=== Bully ===
Throughout the second volume, Evan is repeatedly shown being picked on and tormented by a school [[bully]]. The reasons given for this animosity are never given, but it is implied to have been ongoing for an extended time before the story. Whenever this bully is around, Evan will often lose his temper or be manipulated into whatever the bully desires at that moment. Over the course of the comic, he develops the courage to stand up to this oppression, him and his friends successfully riding him in the moment.
