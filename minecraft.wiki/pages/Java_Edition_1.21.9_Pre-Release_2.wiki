'''1.21.9 Pre-Release 2''' (known as '''1.21.9-pre2''' in the launcher) is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.21.9]], released on September 19, 2025.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-21-9-pre-release-2|Minecraft 1.21.9 Pre-Release 2|September 19, 2025}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Copper golem]]'''
* The copper golem's behavior for turning into a statue has been tweaked to match {{BE}}.
** Copper golems no longer need to be close to the center of an empty block position in order to turn into a statue.
** Copper golems now have the possibility to turn into a statue as soon as they become fully oxidized.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
*The data [[pack format]] version is now <code>88.0</code>.
** This is due to breaking changes to {{cmd|/setworldspawn}} and {{cmd|/spawnpoint}} in the previous pre-release.
