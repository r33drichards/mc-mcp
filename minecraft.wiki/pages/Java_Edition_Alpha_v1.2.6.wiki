'''Alpha v1.2.6''' is a version of [[Java Edition Alpha]] released with [[Alpha server 0.2.8|server 0.2.8]] on December 3, 2010,<ref>[[wordofnotch:2082284675|Bug update #5, and we need videos]] – The Word of Notch, December 3, 2010</ref> which is the fifth and final part of a bug-fix update. It is the last version of the Alpha development phase.

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Added small [[water lake]]s and rare [[lava pool]]s, both on the surface and randomly in caves.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Commands]]'''
* {{cmd|kill}} 
** Deals {{hp|1000}} damage to the player.

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* Items no longer get used when opening chests (e.g., food being eaten, lava being poured out, etc.)
* Breaking a boat in a certain fashion no longer causes it to drop multiple times the normal amount.
* Patched client to prevent duplicated entities.
* Fixed a crash bug when destroying the vehicle from under a player.</onlyinclude>

== Bugs ==
* In this version and [[Alpha v1.2.5]], if the [[player]]'s name is not set properly (which occurs in the modern [[launcher]]), they are always named "Player524". This makes multiplayer in this version impossible without the use of third-party tools, as two players cannot join a server with the same name.
