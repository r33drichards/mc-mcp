A '''wandering trader''' is a [[passive mob]] that sometimes spawns near [[player]]s, alongside two [[trader llama]]s tied to it with [[lead]]s. It can be [[trade]]d with, buying commonly available resources and selling [[item]]s mostly native to specific [[biome]]s. Its trades are randomized each time it spawns, and it will despawn after enough time has passed.

== Spawning ==
Wandering traders spawn randomly with two leashed trader llamas in the [[Overworld]] near the player, in any biome except in [[the void]] biome, controlled by the {{cd|#minecraft:without_wandering_trader_spawns}} biome tag {{in|JE}}. They typically spawn within a 48-block radius of a player. {{IN|bedrock}}, they also try to spawn by a claimed [[bell]] in a [[village]]. 

When the world is created (or updated from an older version), a counter is initialized to 24000 [[tick]]s (20 real-life minutes, or 1 Minecraft day). Each minute (1200 ticks), if {{gmr|spawn_wandering_traders}} is set to {{code|true}},{{only|java}} the counter is decreased by 1200. When the counter reaches 0 it is reset to 24000 and an attempt may be made to spawn a wandering trader, unless the game rule {{gmr|spawn_mobs|domobspawning}} is set to {{code|false}}.

When the counter is equal to 0 or lower for the first time, there is a 25% chance of making the attempt, which increases to 50% the second time and 75% thereafter until a trader is spawned, or no player is found for the attempt, where it will then be reset to 25%. If a player is found, then there is a 10% chance for a wandering trader to spawn. In summary, when the counter is equal to 0 or lower, the total chance that a trader will spawn will be either 2.5%, 5%, or 7.5% depending on the above conditions.

When attempting a spawn, a random player is selected as the target location. If there is a [[bell]] within 48 blocks of the player, then the nearest such bell is used as the target location instead. Ten attempts are then made to find a valid mob spawning location. This is made on the uppermost block of a random X/Z position within -48/+47 of the target location on each axis. In ''Java Edition'', the game uses the highest Y-level "surface" block for these attempts, so the wandering trader will not spawn inside enclosed caves. If spawning the trader succeeds, an additional ten attempts are made for each of two trader llamas to find a position within -4/+3 of the trader in ''Java Edition''. In ''Bedrock Edition'', the trader always spawns together with its llamas on the same block. Wandering traders and their llamas can still spawn if the passive [[mob cap]] is full.

{{IN|bedrock}}, when using [[spawn egg]]s or the {{cmd|summon}} [[command]] to spawn a wandering trader, llamas always spawn with it. Wandering traders never spawn if {{cmd|mobevent minecraft:wandering_trader_event}} is set to {{code|false}}.

=== Despawning ===
{{IN|java}}, a wandering trader despawns after being loaded for 48000 [[tick]]s (40 minutes, or 2 full ''Minecraft'' days), although ticks spent with the trading UI open are not counted. {{IN|bedrock}}, a wandering trader despawns after being loaded for either 48000 ticks (2 full ''Minecraft'' days) or 72000 ticks (3 full days) and the nearest player is more than 24 blocks away from it. In ''Bedrock Edition'', wandering traders also immediately despawn if all trades are used up and the nearest player is more than 24 blocks away.

Unlike most mobs, naming the wandering trader with a [[name tag]] and/or placing it in a [[boat]]/[[minecart]] does not prevent it from despawning.<ref>{{bug|MC-143982||Named wandering traders despawn|WAI}}</ref> This also includes wandering traders as passengers of other mobs in ''Java Edition'', where it still despawns if summoned on top of another mob.

When a wandering trader is unloaded, either by moving into unloaded [[chunk]]s or entering another [[dimension]], its despawn timer freezes.

== Behavior ==
After spawning, the wandering trader prefers to wander within 16 blocks of the initial spawning target location, even if that player leaves, if not otherwise reacting to nearby players or mobs.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

Wandering traders drink a [[potion of Invisibility]] during dusk and as needed to renew the effect during the night. They also drink [[milk]] if invisible during the day to remove the [[Invisibility]] effect.

Wandering traders avoid [[zombie]]s and their variants ([[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s, [[drowned]], [[zombified piglin]]s, [[zoglin]]s), all [[illager]] variants ([[pillager]]s, [[vindicator]]s, [[evoker]]s, [[illusioner]]s{{only|JE}}), [[ravager]]s, and [[vex]]es, staying at least 8 [[block]]s away. Unlike [[villager]]s, a wandering trader killed by zombies does not become a [[zombie villager]].<ref>{{bug|MC-143747||Wandering trader never becomes zombie villager|WF}}</ref> [[Witch]]es do not attack wandering traders.

Wandering traders drink potions of Invisibility if hurt by magic attacks or projectiles from hostile [[mob]]s (but not players), or when avoiding illagers, vexes, and zombies.{{only|bedrock|short=y}} 

When attacked by a [[player]], a wandering trader flees from the player as a [[villager]] would do. The [[trader llama]]s, however, attack the player by spitting if their master gets hit, except in [[Peaceful]]. The llamas stop attacking if the player is killed and respawns, if the llamas are leashed after the wandering trader is killed, or if the player gets far enough away from them for a short period of time. 

The wandering trader can sometimes form a caravan, due to wild [[llama]]s that follow the leashed trader llama(s).

Despite their similarities to villagers, attacking or killing wandering traders does not anger [[iron golem]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-153693||Wandering traders that are being attacked by players do not anger village-spawned iron golems|WAI}}</ref>

Unlike most other villager-like mobs, wandering traders do not visually sit down when riding objects such as [[boat]]s and [[minecart]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-161106||Villagers, wandering traders and witches do not have a sitting animation, but other villager-related mobs do|WAI}}</ref>

== Trading ==
[[File:Wandering Trader GUI.png|thumb|right|The trading UI of a wandering trader in ''Java Edition'']]

The [[trading]] system is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows [[player]]s to buy and sell [[item]]s, in this case from a wandering trader.

Pressing the {{control|use}} control on the wandering trader allows a player to view the different trade offers, similar to a villager. Different offers are visible in a list, and clicking on one of the offers moves the corresponding items to the slots above the player's [[inventory]]. All offers involve [[emerald]]s as a currency.

Wandering traders typically sell items generated in the world or otherwise related to nature, such as [[plant]]s, [[dye]]s, and [[buckets of fish]]. They can also trade less common items, such as [[coral block]]s, [[blue ice]], or [[nautilus shell]]s. Overall, trades offered by wandering traders offer a way to obtain biome-specific materials, without having to travel to the specific biomes. They will also buy a select few items from the player, giving emeralds in return.

After the [[player]] uses the same trade several times, the wandering trader locks the trade, but unlike villagers, never unlocks the trade. The wandering trader can appear again around the player with new trades after a while.

Wandering traders do not have the novice-master trading system like villagers. Instead, the player can buy anything from the wandering trader without the need of unlocking the previous trades.

Wandering traders do not increase the prices of its items being sold if attacked by the player, but does decrease the price if the player has the [[Hero of the Village]] effect {{in|bedrock}}.

Unlike [[villager]]s, wandering traders do not have an experience bar or career levels, and do not modify their offers or prices based on changing demand. This (the trade items or prices) can be changed by the player by editing the corresponding NBT data flag through the use of the {{cmd|data}}{{only|je|short=1}} command.

Wandering traders are the only [[renewable]] source of [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[coral block]]s, and [[small dripleaves]] without glitches.

The wandering trader cannot work at a job site block and restock, even when summoned with a villager profession or other villager data.

=== Trade offers ===
The wandering trader offers nine trades in total: it always purchases two random items, sells two special items, and sells five more ordinary items.

These trades in each of these groups are not divided into categories; for example, a single wandering trader can sell 2 different saplings. Each individual trade is equally likely.{{verify}}

In the trading GUI, the trade offers are always listed in this order:<br>
* 2 purchasing trades
* 2 special selling trades 
* 5 ordinary selling trades

== Drops ==
* A [[milk bucket]] (8.5% chance, increased 1% per level of [[Looting]]) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.
* A [[potion of Invisibility]] (8.5% chance, increased 1% per level of [[Looting]]) if killed while holding or before finishing drinking.
A wandering trader is also a source of [[lead]]s, as it typically spawns with two leashed [[trader llama]]s. These leads break and drop (at the location of the llama) if either trader or llama dies, if they are separated, or if the player uses shears to snip the lead(s). Shearing the wandering trader has no effect. The leads can only be sheared off the llamas.

Separating mobs upon leads have the connection broken, dropping the leads if they enter boats for example. Unless they enter the same boat at the same time, every lead is always broken if at least one moves into a boat (or [[minecart]]).

Wandering traders do not drop any loot or [[experience]] when killed (except for the consumables mentioned above).

{{IN|bedrock}}, wandering traders reward experience after a successful trade.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The wandering trader was inspired by traveling merchants from various RPGs, specifically ones that appeared to provide players with healing items in dangerous places.<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-wandering-trader|Meet the Wandering Trader|March 22, 2019|Per Landin}}</ref> It especially resembles the Travelling Merchant from Terraria.
* Wandering traders display their held items differently than most creatures do, using the "ground" parameter instead of the usual hand parameter in model display settings.
