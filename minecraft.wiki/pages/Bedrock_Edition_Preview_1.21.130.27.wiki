== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", "Upcoming Creator Features", and "Render Dragon Features for Creators"  [[experimental]] toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
* Added {{cd|BlockComponentRedstoneUpdateEvent}}, which can be subscribed by custom block components.
* Added {{cd|onRedstoneUpdate}} custom component subscription in {{cd|beta}} with the following conditions:
** Block has {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} component, otherwise CONTENT_ERROR is thrown.
*** Subscription is not queued if the {{cd|BlockComponentRedstoneUpdateEvent.powerLevel}} is less than {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} field {{cd|min_power}}.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* The {{cd|minecraft:corner}} block state is now mirrored when used within a structure.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:redstone_consumer}} component behind the Upcoming Creator Features experiment.
** Contains optional field {{cd|min_power}}, which defines the minimum value for incoming signal strength.
*** If signal strength is greater than or equal to this value, then the {{cd|onRedstoneUpdate}} event is sent to Scripts.
** Contains optional field {{cd|propogates_power}}, a boolean to control whether a signal can pass through this block or not.
* Modified {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} block component:
** Removed redundant experimental field {{cd|shaded}}.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:leashable}} block component, which allows custom blocks to receive a lead attachment creating a leash knot, including an offset field to change the position of the [[leash knot]]. Only available with the Upcoming Creator Features experiment enabled.

'''Graphical'''
* Added Colored Static Block Lighting under the Render Dragon Features for Creators toggle.
** Only available in Preview worlds that are using [[Vibrant Visuals]], which the experiment toggle is active.
** Static lights can be defined in {{cd|local_lighting.json}} using {{cd|"light_type": "static_light"}}.
*** Blocks with the {{cd|"point_light"}} {{cd|light_type}} will also receive colored static lighting.
** Static lighting follows lighting rules and respects the {{cd|minecraft:light_emission}} and {{cd|minecraft:light_dampening}} block components.
** Static lighting is additive/accumulated, so overlapping lights of different colors will cause lighting to get brighter.
*** Overlapping lights of the same type (i.e. same color and {{cd|light_emission}}) will not cause lighting to get brighter.
** Static lighting is not affected by [[stained glass]] or other translucent blocks.
