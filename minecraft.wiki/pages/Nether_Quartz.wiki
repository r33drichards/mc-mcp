'''Nether quartz''' is a white mineral found in [[the Nether]] used mainly for crafting decorative blocks and redstone components.

== Obtaining ==
{{see also|Nether Quartz Ore#Natural generation}}

=== Mining ===

[[Nether quartz ore]] mined using a [[pickaxe]] drops one unit of Nether quartz. If the pickaxe is enchanted with [[Fortune]], it may drop an extra unit per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of four and an average of 2.2 with Fortune III. If the pickaxe is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], the ore drops itself.

== Trivia ==
* All of the sensor related items that are craftable (comparator, daylight sensor, observer) are crafted with some Nether quartz involved.
* In the [[Minecraft Annual 2025]], [[Efe]] is shown bartering with a piglin, and the piglin giving them Nether quartz back, but with the original texture.
