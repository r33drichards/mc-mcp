A '''pitcher plant''' is a tall ancient<ref> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJ2dzVcOgg</ref> [[flower]] that grows from a [[pitcher pod]].

== Obtaining ==
Pitcher plants do not generate naturally and are obtained by growing a [[pitcher pod]]. Breaking a fully grown pitcher crop drops one pitcher plant. 

Unlike the other tall flowers, it is not possible to duplicate pitcher plants by applying [[bone meal]] on them.

=== Breaking ===
Pitcher plants can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] with any item or by hand.

A pitcher plant also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

== Usage ==
Like most flowers, pitcher plants can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]. Like other tall flowers, pitcher plants cannot be placed inside [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s see player-placed pitcher plants as flowers, but they ignore fully grown pitcher crops.

Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with pitcher plants, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding===
Pitcher plants can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a pitcher plant have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a pitcher plant into a [[composter]] has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Trivia ==
* While referred to by a generic name, the plant is meant to be a fictional species.<ref>
{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1639719720671666178|Imaginary one!}}</ref> They are loosely based on the real {{W|Pitcher plant|carnivorous plant of the same name|newtab=1}}, but with more of the look of "an orchid or something more ornamental".<ref>{{ytl|1pxa47yWydo|Ask Mojang|Minecraft|April 27, 2023}}</ref>
* In-universe, pitcher plants taste peppery, acidic, and like spoiled cotton candy.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1696195685152956541|The in-game pitcher plant tastes a bit like spoiled cotton candy, but strangely enough somehow also both peppery and acidic, an acquired taste! It is inspired by the real world pitcher plant, which one should NOT eat.}}</ref>
