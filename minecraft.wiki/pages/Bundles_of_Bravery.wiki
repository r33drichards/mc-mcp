'''Bundles of Bravery''' is a [[game drop]] that was released on October 22, 2024, as [[Java Edition 1.21.2]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.40]]. It adds [[bundle]]s to the game. It also adds [[Hardcore]] mode to {{BE}} and makes it available to [[Realms]] on {{JE}}. 

The game drop was announced at [[Minecraft Live 2024]], though the name was accidentally revealed on [[Minecraft.net]] as part of a summary of the event posted a few days before it happened.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/live|title=Minecraft Live|website=Minecraft.net|date=September 24, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240924180401/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/live}}</ref>

=== Game modes ===

* Each banner pattern item now includes their pattern in their name instead of as a subtitle.

'''[[Smithing template]]'''

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Bee JE1.gif|32px]] [[Bee]]'''
* Now wander around randomly for less time after exiting a nest/hive.
* If a bee has a known nest/hive, it travels less far from it, thus being less likely to get lost.
* Significantly increased the amount of time a bee can take to return to a known nest/hive before it gives up trying to return home.
* Bees are now a lot less likely to get stuck on corners or when they are close to a nest/hive they are trying to return to.
* Bees are also now a lot less likely to try and pathfind to a flower they cannot reach.
