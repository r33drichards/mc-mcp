'''15w32a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on August 5, 2015.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/08/minecraft-snapshot-15w32a/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''Keyboard shortcuts'''
* {{key|F3}}+{{key|N}} now toggles between [[Creative]] and [[Spectator]] mode, when the player is in either of them.
** The player needs to be allowed to use {{cmd|gamemode}} for this to work.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* <code>sneakTime</code>
** Tracks the amount of ticks the player has held the {{Control|sneak}} key, regardless if the player was moving.

'''[[Data version]]s'''
* Worlds now display and store the version it was last played in, or "unknown" if the version was older than snapshot 15w32a.
** If the world has not been opened in one of the 1.9 snapshots yet, there will be an exclamation mark (!) next to the world's name on the far right that displays text when hovered over: "Don't forget to backup this world before you load it in this snapshot."

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
{{Animate|Creeper JE3 BE1.png;Skeleton JE5 BE3.png;Zombie JE2 BE1.png|29px}} '''[[Creeper]]s, [[Skeleton]]s, and [[Zombie]]s'''
* Must be closer to notice players wearing their corresponding [[head]].
** Specifically, the detection range is halved.
** This reduction stacks with the reductions from sneaking and [[Invisibility]].
** Does not apply to [[wither skeleton]]s.

[[File:Ender Dragon.gif|width=64x64]] '''[[Ender Dragon]]'''
* No longer stops its attack on a single hit.
* Now flies back to portal before finishing its death animation.
* No longer takes damage from [[snowball]]s, [[egg]]s, or [[fishing rod]]s.
* Now immediately charges at the player after finishing its dragon breath attack.
* Fireballs now spread ender acid upon exploding.
** No longer light the ground on [[fire]].
* The charge attack has been given a great amount of knockback.
* Dragon wings and tail now damage the player, prevent side and back melee attacks when the dragon lands on the [[Exit portal|portal]].
* Dragon's breath now shoots out farther.

[[File:Shulker JE1 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Shulker]]'''
* Projectiles no longer follow the player in [[Spectator]] mode.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* <code>Tags</code> and <code>DataVersion</code> tag can now be applied on [[entities]].
* Changed the <code>Fuse</code> tag's type for the <code>PrimedTnt</code> entity from "Byte" to "Short".
