'''23w17a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20]], released on April 26, 2023<ref>{{snap|23w17a|April 26, 2023}}</ref>, which adds a new [[music disc]], new [[advancement]]s, new [[music]], and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Items === 
'''[[Music disc]]'''
* [[File:Music Disc Relic JE1 BE1.png|32px]] Added a new music disc by [[Aaron Cherof]] titled "[[Relic]]".
** Can only be obtained when brushing [[suspicious gravel]]s within [[trail ruins]], with {{frac|1|12}} chance appeared as a rare loot.
** Gives a comparator output signal strength of 14 when in a [[Jukebox]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s<!-- DO NOT "FIX" ANY CAPITALIZATIONS HERE, HAD FOLLOWED THE ORIGINAL TEXT STRICTLY ALREADY, CONTACT MOJANG IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION -->'''

** Smells interesting

** Careful restoration

=== General ===
'''[[Font]]'''
* Added <code>unihex</code> glyph provider.
** A new glyph provider for reading Unifont HEX files.
*** HEX format describes bitmap font glyphs.
**** Height of every glyph is 16 pixels.
**** Width of glyph can be 8, 16, 24 or 32 pixels.
*** Every line is made of two hexadecimal numbers separated by <code>:</code>.
*** First value describes codepoint - it must have 4, 5 or 6 hex digits.
*** Second value describes glyph as a stream of bits, line by line.
** When rendering, empty columns on left and right side of glyph are removed.
*** Custom glyph widths can be set with <code>size_overrides</code>.
** Provider requires two fields:
*** <code>hex_file</code>: Path to ZIP archive containing one or more *.hex files (files in archive with different extensions are ignored).
*** <code>size_overrides</code>: List of codepoint ranges that should have width different that auto-detected (based on empty space in glyph). Fields:
**** <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>: Start and end of codepoint range (inclusive).
**** <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>: Integers describing position of left-most and right-most columns of glyph in range.
***** Any bits in columns outside this range are discarded.
* Added <code>reference</code> glyph provider.
** New glyph provider can be used to include providers from other fonts.
*** Providers are guaranteed to be loaded only once, no matter how many times they are included.
** Provider has one field <code>id</code>, that describes other font to be included in currently loaded one.
*** Inclusion is performed after all fonts are loaded, so it includes all providers for a given font defined in all resource packs.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added <code>sniffer_digging</code>: contains <code>torchflower_seeds</code> and <code>pitcher_pod</code>.
** Controls what can be found by [[sniffer]]s when digging.

'''[[Music]]'''
* Added new ambient soundtracks, all by [[Aaron Cherof]].<ref group=note>Released to all 1.20 snapshots from 23w14a.</ref>
