[[File:Chat BE.png|thumb|The chat menu {{in|BE}}.]]

'''Chat''' is a built-in messaging system used to communicate with other players, or to execute [[commands]]. {{IN|be}}, the chat is a [[menu screen]] that darkens the background.

== Usage ==
By default, players can press {{key|T}} or {{key|Enter}} for keyboards, [[File:Chat button.png|25px]] for touchscreens, or {{Xbutton|onedpad-right}} for controllers to open the chat menu. Recent chat messages are shown on the left side of the [[HUD]].

=== Communication ===
The primary purpose of the chat is for player communication. Generally, the player simply types out their message and presses {{key|Enter}}, or the send button.{{only|be|short=1}}

If the player wishes to privately message another player, they can use the {{cmd|msg}} command.
==== Mentioning ====
{{IN|bedrock}}, the at symbol (<code>@</code>) can be used to autocomplete and highlight a player name in chat. Entering <code>@here</code> mentions all players. When mentioning players in a message, the name can be highlighted in a different color from the rest of chat. The color is yellow by default, but can be changed in the chat settings. While mentioning is not present in ''Java Edition'', the {{key|Tab}} can be used to autocomplete a player's username.

==== Formatting ====
[[File:Textformatting.png|thumb|Shows (from up to down) bold, strikethrough, underlined, italicized, and reset (§r) text (also default)]]
Players can use {{cmd|tellraw}} command to send stylized texts on the chat using [[text component]]. They may apply various text styles, such as custom colors, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and more. In ''Bedrock Edition'', the section symbol (<code>§</code>) also allows players to change the style of the text with [[formatting codes]]. This does not work on vanilla clients due to the fact that the section symbol is restricted. 

In ''Java Edition'', 43 emojis are supported by the game's default font, Mojangles (see {{slink|Mojangles|Emoji}}). They are shown as pixelated icons on text fields, including the chat. In ''Bedrock Edition'', certain characters in the Unicode {{w|code point}}s or shortcodes (such as :furnace:) are reserved for special icons in the game, such as the hunger and armor icons, controller icons, and more.<ref>https://github.com/TwistedAsylumMC/bedrock-unicode-characters</ref><ref>https://wiki.bedrock.dev/text/emojis</ref> Other emojis and unknown characters appear as a question mark (<code>?</code>).

=== Commands ===
{{main|Commands}}

Players can also type commands into the chat. Commands are identified by the use of a forward slash ({{key|/}}) at the beginning of the message. By default, the {{key|/}} key opens the chat with a <code>/</code> already present to easily run commands.

While typing, pressing {{key|TAB}} autocompletes the first possible command or username starting with the letter(s) typed. If there are multiple usernames or commands beginning with the letter(s), a list of possibilities is displayed; pressing  {{key|TAB}}  again scrolls through the list.
*Some commands may also have additional parameters that may be auto-completed by pressing {{key|TAB}} at that point.
**Certain commands that handle blocks (ex. {{cmd|fill}}) have parameters that need the [[coordinates]] of the target block(s). Pressing {{key|TAB}} when these coordinates are needed automatically adds the coordinates of the block the player is looking at.

==== Quick commands ====
{{IN|be}}, there are a few buttons in the chat to execute commands without having to type them in. These commands include {{cmd|setworldspawn}}, {{cmd|teleport}}, {{cmd|time}}, and {{cmd|weather}}. Pressing a command opens a list of arguments. For {{cmd|teleport}}, all players are shown in both the {{cd|<victim>}} and {{cd|<destination>}} arguments. Pressing an argument instantly executes the command.

=== Coordinates ===
{{IN|be}}, the chat also shows the player's coordinates when Copy Coordinate UI in the Creator settings tab is enabled. The player can view and copy both the player's current coordinates and the coordinates of the block the player is facing.
The button next to the copy button pastes any copied text into the text box.

=== Informational messages ===
{{Expand section|There are many more informational messages. See [[Action bar]] for certain messages in Bedrock Edition and the [[Talk:Chat#Feedback (Fri, 04 Jul 2025 06:32:42 UTC)|talk page]].|section=1}}
There are several informational messages shown on the chat when specific actions happen in the [[world]]:
* If a player or a [[Name tag|named]] tamed [[pet]] dies in the world, a [[death message]] is announced to the chat.
* When a player joins or leaves the game, they are announced to the chat.
* When {{gmr|command_block_output|commandblockoutput}} is enabled, all [[command blocks]] when executing a command notify the admin through the chat.
* In ''Bedrock Edition'', when a player uses an [[emote]], it is announced to the chat with the emote's name.
* In ''Bedrock Edition'', when a player changes their character in the [[Character Creator]], it is announced to the chat after the character changed.
* In ''Bedrock Edition'', when a player joins a world or travels between [[dimensions]], the "Open Chat Message" is shown exclusively to that player, which shows the [[keys]] to open the chat and to open the [[Emotes|emote]] GUI. The message can be toggled in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]] and is not shown when using touch controls.
* Whenever a player executes [[emotes]] in ''Bedrock Edition'', it is announced in the chat in green and blue.

=== Chat settings ===
[[File:Chat Settings BE.png|thumb|The chat settings.]]
{{IN|be}}, a chat settings menu can be opened from the chat menu. Options such as the [[font]], text color and size, and line spacing can be changed here. For an overview of the chat settings {{In|je}} configurable through the main options screen, see {{Slink|Options|Chat Settings}}.

== Message history ==
A player can access the message history via a small scroll bar is on the side of the chat. The player can also scroll using the mouse wheel or {{key|PgUp}} and {{key|PgDn}}. The last 100 chat messages are stored. Holding down {{key|LSHIFT}} or {{Key|RSHIFT}} and attempting to scroll up or down slows down scrolling. The player can view their own recently sent messages by pressing the {{key|UP}} and {{key|DOWN}} keys while typing.

== Drafts ==
[[File:Chat draft.png|thumb|right|Chat draft in gray.]]
{{IN|je}}, unsent chat messages will be saved as drafts when chat is forcibly closed from external sources such as dying or opening dialog. When chat is opened next time, the draft is visible in gray and italic. It can be converted to a normal message by typing more text, using arrow keys, clicking the chat or selcting it by using {{key|SHIFT+LEFT}} or {{key|SHIFT+RIGHT}}.

== Notes ==
* {{IN|bedrock}}, the chat background opacity and chat message duration for chat messages shown on the [[HUD]] can't be adjusted from the chat settings menu, but can be found in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].
* {{IN|bedrock}}, any inappropriate word or phrase typed in the chat is censored and replaced by number signs (<code>#</code>). This can be turned off with the "Profanity Filter" option in the [[settings]], but only if the player is signed in with an adult Microsoft account; otherwise, the option is greyed out and cannot be disabled.
