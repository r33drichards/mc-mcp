=== Smelting ===

|Clay
|Terracotta

}}

== Usage ==
=== Building ===
Terracotta has the same blast resistance as most other stone blocks, which is significantly higher than the block of clay before being smelted. A block of terracotta when one block away from a creeper or TNT [[explosion]] protects any blocks behind it, although the terracotta itself is destroyed.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Terracotta}}

=== Note blocks ===
Uncolored terracotta can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce a "bass drum" sound.
