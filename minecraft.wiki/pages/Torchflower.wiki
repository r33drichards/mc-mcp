A '''torchflower''' is an ancient<ref> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJ2dzVcOgg</ref> [[flower]] obtained from harvesting [[torchflower seeds]]. It can be [[Crafting|craft]]ed into [[orange dye]].

== Obtaining ==
Torchflowers do not generate naturally; they are obtained by breaking a fully grown [[torchflower crop]].

{{IN|Bedrock}}, unlike with other one-block-tall flowers, players cannot spread torchflowers on top of nearby grass blocks by applying [[bone meal]] on a torchflower.

=== Breaking ===
A torchflower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A torchflower also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up torchflowers, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

== Usage ==
Like most flowers, torchflowers can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Torchflowers can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a torchflower imparts the {{EffectLink|Night Vision}} effect for 5 seconds. It can be crafted using a torchflower or produced by feeding a torchflower to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with torchflowers, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Torchflowers can be used to [[Breeding|breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a torchflower have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a torchflower into a [[composter]] has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

* Torchflowers are based off the [[w:Kniphofia|''Kniphofia'']] genus of perennial flowering plants, which can be similarly called "torch lilies" as a common name.<ref>{{ytl|1pxa47yWydo|Ask Mojang|Minecraft|OCtober 27, 2023}}</ref>
