In 2017, Arnett was cast in [[MINECON Earth 2017]], becoming the first person to host an annual streaming event for the franchise.

According to the event's trailer, it was in an attempt to "get better than [his] kids." Over the course of the event, a miniature character arc unfolded where he slowly understood the game's culture, culminating in a dance number.

Despite insinuating he would return to host the [[MINECON Earth 2018|next year]], he never did.
