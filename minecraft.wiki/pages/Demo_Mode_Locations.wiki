{{update|Most chest loot described below is no longer accurate due to loot table changes in 1.20.}}

Because the geography of the [[Demo Mode|demo world]] never changes (demo always uses the seed <code>-343522682</code> or <code>North Carolina</code>), the locations of various landmarks may be put on this page. These can help act as a guide for Minecraft players who are exploring the demo world. This page only lists landmarks that are within 3,000 blocks of the point 0,0.
