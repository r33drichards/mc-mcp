A considerable amount of different atlases were used for GUI textures before being split in [[Java Edition 23w31a]]. These texture files are now compiled into [[gui.png-atlas]].

A handful of other user interface graphics were generated by the game at runtime, rather than being defined as image files, either in atlases or as independent files. Many of these were later made to be texture defined. Examples include:
* Text field (normal and highlighted) - textures added in 23w32a
* Scroller handle - texture added in 23w32a
* Scroller background - texture added in 24w09a
* Tooltip - texture added in 24w36a
* Highlighted slot - added in 24w37a

In addition, UI buttons were generated by code from [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.13a|0.0.13a]] to [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.22a_05|0.0.22a_05]] before the introduction of {{code|widgets.png}} in [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.23a]], making this case somewhat of a very early precursor.

==== <samp>advancements/tabs.png</samp> ====
<samp>tabs.png</samp> was used for storing tab textures for use in the advancement menu.

==== <samp>bars.png</samp> ====
<samp>bars.png</samp> was used for storing boss bar textures and their overlays.

The file was compressed in 15w49a, 1.11-pre1 and 19w41a.

==== <samp>icons.png</samp> ====
{{main|icons.png}}

<samp>icons.png</samp> was used for storing the textures of certain UI elements.

==== <samp>inventory.png</samp> ====
{{main|inventory.png}}

This file still exists, but only houses the graphic for the inventory window; it was formerly an atlas containing further sprites, and before that housed several [[status effect]] textures.

==== <samp>widgets.png</samp> ====
{{main|widgets.png}}
<samp>widgets.png</samp> (previously known as <samp>gui.png</samp>) was used for defining several types of menu buttons and icons.

Previously known as <samp>slot.png</samp>
