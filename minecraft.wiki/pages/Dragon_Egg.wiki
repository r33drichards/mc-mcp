The '''dragon egg''' is a gravity-affected [[block]] that can be obtained only once per [[world]] (or twice {{in|Bedrock}}<ref name=TwoEggs>{{bug|MCPE-51345}}</ref>) by defeating the [[ender dragon]]. It [[teleport]]s to avoid being {{Control|mined}}, but drops as an [[item]] if it falls onto a non-full block such as a [[torch]] or is pushed by a [[piston]].

== Obtaining ==
The dragon egg is available in the Creative inventory. It can be obtained with {{control|pick block}} or the {{cmd|give}} command, or placed in the world with commands such as {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}}.

=== Breaking ===
The dragon egg usually cannot be mined directly, as trying to do so causes it to [[Teleportation|teleport]] within a 31×15×31 volume centered on the egg, with locations toward the center more likely. If all air blocks in that area are filled so there is nowhere for the egg to teleport to, or if it fails to find an air block after 1,000 attempts at teleporting, it can be mined. 

The dragon egg is a gravity-affected block, and drops as an [[item (entity)|item]] when pushed by a [[piston]] or when it falls onto a block [[Solid block#Height|less than a full block tall]], such as a [[torch]] or a bottom [[slab]].

When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the block always drops as an item.

The dragon egg is not immune to destruction by the ender dragon, despite being produced by it.<ref name=":0">{{bug|MC-165218}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Dragon Egg}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{IN|Java}}, a single dragon egg is generated on top of the [[exit portal]] when the first [[ender dragon]] is defeated. {{IN|Bedrock}}, two dragon eggs generate on top of the exit portal; one generates when the first ender dragon is defeated, while the other generates when the second ender dragon is defeated.<ref name=TwoEggs/>

== Usage ==
{{see also|Falling Block#Behavior}}
[[File:Dragon Egg Heatmap.png|right|thumb|250px|Heatmap of where a dragon egg lands after trying to mine it.]]
[[File:Particles of a dragon egg.png|thumb|Particles of a dragon egg.]]

The dragon egg, if there is no block below it, falls until it lands on the next available block. When it is being affected by gravity and falling, it exhibits a smooth falling animation.

It does not [[suffocate]] mobs or players when it falls and covers them, nor does it squash mobs or players like [[anvil]]s and [[stalactite]]s do.

The dragon egg can be placed on a non-solid block without falling.

Like other falling blocks, when the dragon egg is floating, it has black particles falling from it.

=== Light source ===
The dragon egg emits a [[light level]] of 1.

=== Teleporting ===
To cause the egg to teleport, press {{control|attack}} or {{control|use}} while in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode (or only {{control|use}} in [[Creative]]). It teleports to an air block nearby (up to seven blocks vertically and fifteen blocks horizontally), creating the same particles as an [[enderman]]. It may teleport into the air and subsequently fall to the ground since it forcefully obeys gravity.

When the egg teleports, it creates a particle trail that, {{in|BE}}, leads from its prior location to where it has teleported to; however, {{in|JE}}, a bug<ref name="MC-2157" /> causes the particles not to point correctly to the egg's new location.

If all available air blocks are filled, it is possible to break the block.

Dragon egg teleportation lacks teleportation sounds.<ref>{{bug|MC-166291|||Invalid}}</ref>

If egg teleportation finds an invalid location (such as below the world), it makes an additional attempt to find a valid location centered on the invalid location rather than the original position.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Developer [[Ulraf]] in a livestream expressed the idea of giving the dragon egg the use of modifying the [[world spawn]], because there is only one dragon egg per world. He clarified that he experimented with this idea using [[command]]s, and that there weren't plans to add this function to vanilla.<ref> https://youtu.be/2cxUNoWNy50?t=11284</ref>
* The writer of the ''Minecraft'' comic ''WonderCraft'', Samcube, was requested by [[Mojang Studios]] to create official ''Minecraft'' posters. In a part of these works, one can see an area with an ender dragon and a [[chicken]] on top of a [[huge mushroom]]. In the same scene, the dragon egg is visible near the chicken.
* If the dragon egg teleports and falls into the portal, it spawns in the Overworld at the world spawn.
