'''Copper spleaves''' are joke [[block]]s introduced in [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]] which are broken upon any contact with most types of [[entities]]. They generate when a [[lunar base]] on [[the Moon]] is activated via the pressure plate on top.

== Obtaining ==
Copper spleaves can be obtained via the [[Creative]] inventory or with [[commands]], but are unobtainable by [[Survival]] means.

===Breaking===
Copper spleaves cannot be obtained when mined, even using a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]].

== Issues ==
{{April Fools issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The exact y level the player needs to be in to not break the copper spleaves is just less than 1 above the block.
* Copper spleaves only have a weathered texture, despite being a copper block.
* [[Copper grate]]s were added in [[Java Edition 1.21|1.21]], and have a similar appearance to copper spleaves.
