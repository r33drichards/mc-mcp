'''Smooth stone bricks''' were an unobtainable variant of stone bricks, to which they visually appeared the same.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Smooth stone bricks could be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Smooth Stone Bricks|Pickaxe|Wood|hidecopper=1}}

== Usage ==
{{info needed section|How did they interact with silverfish?}}
Smooth stone bricks could be used as a construction material much like regular stone bricks.

=== Note Blocks ===
Smooth stone bricks could be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release|Smooth stone bricks did not officially exist in this edition. However, like in Bedrock Edition, different types of stone bricks were distinguished via metadata; since smooth stone bricks in Bedrock Edition were the base ID with metadata 4, the corresponding ID-metadata combination in Java Edition could be considered smooth stone bricks. These are covered in more detail at the [[Invalid Data Value Stone Bricks]] page.}}
