'''Lessons in Good Trouble''', also known as '''Good Trouble''' and '''Good Troubles: Lessons in Social Justice''', is an educational map created to teach the history of civil rights movements, created in partnership with {{w|Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Teaching_Tolerance|Teaching Tolerance}}.

== Summary ==
[[File:Lessons in Good Trouble info room.png|thumb|The info room.]]
The map opens on a room lined with [[potted fern]]s and illuminated by sea lanterns, with a large green sign explaining the message of what will follow. Once the player is ready to begin the campaign, they can {{Control|interact}} with an [[NPC]]; opposing them is a set of [[dark oak door]]s, which can be opened but lead nowhere, blocked by [[barrier]]s.{{Only|Education}}

The map proper begins in a lobby filled with many NPCs, the closest being congressman {{Wikipedia|John Lewis}}, standing in front of the same green speech. {{Control|Interacting}} with him will explain who he is, and point towards an activity guide which can be read through either a [[lectern]] or a [[chest]] of [[book]]s, explaining more about the map's subject. Furthermore, he can transport the player into the main story of the map, with additional NPCs present to warp to a desired section.

=== USA, 2020 ===
[[File:USA, 2020.png|thumb|Protestors in Washington D.C.]]
Set in {{Wikipedia|Black Lives Matter Plaza}} in {{Wikipedia|Downtown (Washington, D.C.)|downtown Washington, D.C.}}, John Lewis begins by introducing the concept of the map: he will teach the player on the history of several heroes throughout history. He points the player towards a green [[beacon]], where he will teleport and expand on the subject. The first is located by two sets of [[NPC|protestors]], holding down [[birch sign]]s in support of {{Wikipedia|Black Lives Matter}}. John reminisces about his career, helping the {{Wikipedia|Civil Rights Movement}}.

He continues behind a larger crowd, grouped on the L in Lives. He recounts the many times he'd been arrested for speaking out, from sit-ins to the {{Wikipedia|Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides}}. The conversation progresses on the M of Matters, with a much smaller crowd, as John stresses that there are many people across the globe who are fighting for equality. Just like the player, they can make a difference, enforcing what's right where justice hasn't been served. He invites the player to engage in time travel to meet other important figures across history.

Near the largest crowd in the area, so large that there are police NPCs present, John Lewis explains the origins of Black Lives Matter, crediting {{Wikipedia|Alicia Garza}}, {{Wikipedia|Patrisse Cullors}} and {{Wikipedia|Ayọ Tometi}}. From there, the protest will culminate in a police blockade, with two vehicles in tow. Beyond those, John Lewis offers an activity, teaching the player about the significance of street art, such as graffiti. Using a spot on the city block, he enables the player to build their own street art, in the form of a [[chest]] containing all colors of [[concrete]], three [[diamond pickaxe]]s, and red, orange, yellow, lime, light blue, blue, magenta, and pink [[stained glass]]. The blocks can only be placed inside of a 10x44 grid, marked by [[smooth stone]] and [[iron bar]]s.

After completing the optional activity, players can approach John again, now in front of a [[glowstone]] arrow. He tells a story about how he loved to read as a child, but was barred from reading due to racial prejudice, leading him to be inspired by {{Wikipedia|Martin Luther King Jr.}}, and eventually write books of his own. Thus, the area transitions into a build of a large book, leading into the second area.

=== Pakistan, 2012 ===
[[File:Pakistan, 2012.png|thumb|Citizens of Pakistan.]]
The section begins with a downhill march, down a [[path]] through a [[badlands]] biome representing {{Wikipedia|Pakistan}} into a small town, with buildings made of [[red sandstone]] and [[acacia planks]]. John Lewis introduces {{Wikipedia|Malala Yousafzai}}, and lets her explain her upbringing under the {{Wikipedia|Taliban}}, and accomplishments culminating in winning a {{Wikipedia|Nobel Peace Prize}}. Not far from the two is another activity, hosted by Malala Yousafzai. She explains that the Taliban has been defeated in the local village, and the {{Wikipedia|Malala Fund}} have requested that the player help repair a girls school. Similar to the Street Art activity, players are allowed to build in a confined space, now with a 16x13 radius, and a greater variety of blocks to build with in a [[double chest]].

Once that activity is concluded, players can approach John Lewis by a nearby military vehicle, thanking Malala for her hard work. He changes the subject to a different point in history, pointing towards a rapidly transforming road, leading into the next section.

=== S. Africa, 1992 ===
[[File:S. Africa, 1992.png|thumb|Segregation in South Africa.]]
Set in {{Wikipedia|South Africa}}, the area can be seen from quite far away, due to the presence of large purple trees. Immediately, John Lewis introduces the player to {{Wikipedia|Nelson Mandela}}, and explains his role in advocating for equality under the {{Wikipedia|Apartheid|Apartheid Government}}. Nelson elaborates, talking about how he was sentenced for thirty years, but didn't let that stop him, culminating in him ending Apartheid in 1992 and his election as the first black president of South Africa. The player can progress down a road, showing the {{Wikipedia|Racial segregation|segregation}} on both sides of the road, with the left being white and right black.

At the end of the road is Nelson, who points towards a statue dedicated to {{Wikipedia|Steve Biko}}. He requests that the player learn about other activists who stood up to the Apartheid, and build a monument to honor them on a 7x7 spot. Behind him is John Lewis, standing on a glowstone disk, who says the next stop on the journey is America in the 1960's, where he'll share some of his own experiences.

=== USA, 50's & 60's ===
[[File:USA, 50's & 60's.png|thumb|Martin Luther King Jr, beside two of the pivotal stories of the Civil Rights Movement.]]
In order to enter the area, players must pass through a doorway into a cityscape, somewhat larger than the one before, with John Lewis and a beacon visible on top of a steep roadway. This time, he is standing beside Martin Luther King Jr. himself, who recounts his upbringing in the segregated south, and his famous {{Wikipedia|March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington}}. Not far away is a second Martin Luther King Jr, who recounts the {{Wikipedia|Greensboro sit-ins}} in front of the diner where they happened. Instead of a building challenge, Dr. King instead encourages the player to write about their own experiences with discrimination, gifting them a [[book and quill]].

Behind him, is a recreation of the diner, complete with a partial replica of the interior. Three white NPCs sit at [[chiseled quartz]] in front of the windows, while stand-ins for {{Wikipedia|David Richmond (activist)|David Richmond}}, {{Wikipedia|Franklin McCain}}, {{Wikipedia|Ezell Blair Jr.}}, and {{Wikipedia|Joseph McNeil}} are at the counter. Beside the diner, marked by a beacon, is another recreation, in the form of the site of the {{Wikipedia|Montgomery bus boycott}}. Beside the beacon is John Lewis, and {{Wikipedia|Rosa Parks}} herself, who is cited as an inspiration by John.
[[File:Edmund Pettus Bridge.png|thumb|The Edmund Pettus Bridge.]]
Outside the bus, the road takes a left, with many activists standing on both sides of the sidewalk. An NPC, named Civil Rights Activist, explains that John Lewis led the first of three {{Wikipedia|Selma to Montgomery marches}}. Following a series of glowstone arrows, the player crosses over {{Wikipedia|Edmund Pettus Bridge}}, as protestors begin to slowly appear. At the end of the path is a green beacon, before a series of police officers and guard dogs. Instead of John Lewis, at the end of the path is his younger self, explaining more about the protests and the abuse he suffered by the police. After walking past the [[Fence Gate|blockades]], John Lewis as he appears elsewhere in the map returns, and explains they must now travel even further back in time.

=== India, 1900s ===
[[File:India, 1900s.png|thumb|A village in India.]]
Once again, the section is accessed by passing through a building, this time a large palace. The player will pass by several regal NPCs, with a nobleman above on a balcony, before passing through a grassland into a rural village made of [[terracotta]] with [[Hay Bale|hay]] roofs. Exploring will lead to a temple, where John Lewis will be standing beside none other than {{Wikipedia|Mahatma Gandhi}} himself. {{Control|Interacting}} with John Lewis will establish many of Gandhi's accomplishments, inspiring many people, including Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi will elaborate, stressing his belief in {{Wikipedia|Satyagraha|satyagraha}}, which he learned while in South Africa.

Right beside the structure will be a second Gandhi, beside the area's resident activity. He will explain his belief in pacifism, loving all (including enemies), and encourages building a monument to represent his teachings. Unlike the others challenges, the terrain used is made up of [[allow]] blocks with a nearby [[structure block]], enabling the player to export the build if desired. Down another path of glowstone arrows will lead back to John Lewis, pointing towards {{Wikipedia|London}}.

=== London, 1918 ===
[[File:London, 1918.png|thumb|London during 1918.]]
Entering through a brick gate, the player will find a 20th century city, with [[Coarse Dirt|dirt]] roads and wagons immediately present. Passing by a propaganda poster, players can find John Lewis beside {{Wikipedia|Emmeline Pankhurst}}, founder of the {{Wikipedia|Women's Franchise League}}. She explains the pronunciation of suffragettes; it was "suffraGETtes, because we intended to GET the vote-and we did!" Behind her is a poster in support of her movement, and to the right is an activity. Instead of building or creating anything, Emmeline tasks the player to spread word of women being allowed to vote, in order to open the gate to the final section.

The closest to the site of the vote is named Rebecca, identifiable by her red dress and brown hair, located right next to the John Lewis. The second closest, Flora, is to the right and stationed beside a wagon. Closest to the entrance, Jennifer, can be reached by passing by a rounded display of a skull, and is across the street from Emma, in front of several [[armor]] [[Armor Stand|displays]]. From there the player can find Hortense inside of a library, slightly out of reach by broken [[Stone Brick Stairs|stairs]], and from there can see Hannah across another street. Behind her and a wagon is Charlene, and to the left of the library is Mary, behind a desk, accompanied by several ''[[Painting|Wanderers]]''. 

Returning to the hub of the activity, players can look in on voting, with many masculine NPCs huddled in a line. John Lewis will explain he desires to return to the present, giving some final thoughts.

=== BLM Plaza, 2020 ===
[[File:BLM Plaza, 2020.png|thumb|The end.]]
Walking through the London gates, the player will return to Washington D.C. However, the Black Lives Matter Plaza is now empty from a glance, John Lewis being very far away on the second T. If the player walks all the way or fast travels over, he explains that he visited the plaza in July 2020, and wrote an article that would only be published after his death. In place of the book, the end of the plaza is now the {{Wikipedia|White House}}, with a final appearance from John Lewis, recounting on the figures of the map. The map ends with him offering to return the player to the lobby, hoping to have left a good impression.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Update Honeycomb.png|thumb|130px|Missing honeycomb blocks.]]
* In Pakistan, among the stationary NPCs is a retextured [[villager]], with the [[trades]] of a fisherman.
* Throughout London, there are many real historical posters from the time.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Votes_For_Women.jpg|title=Votes For Women|author=Hilda Dallas|website=|date=1909}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You|title=Lord Kitchener Wants You|author=Alfred Leete|date=1914}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O685356/the-suffragette-1d-weekly-poster-dallas-hilda/|title=The Suffragette 1d Weekly|author=Hilda Dallas|date=1914 (issued)}}</ref>
* Despite being released after it, the Marketplace version of the map is based in a version of [[Village & Pillage]], meaning that [[honeycomb block]]s used in London are replaced by [[Info update]].
* Curiously, during the USA, 50's & 60's section, [[Trader Llama|trader llamas]] can be found on top of buildings, as well as in a valley area near the Edmund Pettus Bridge, complete with dropped leads.{{Needs testing}}
** Similarly, [[Squid|squids]] and [[Dolphin|dolphins]] freely spawn in the {{Wikipedia|Alabama River}}.
