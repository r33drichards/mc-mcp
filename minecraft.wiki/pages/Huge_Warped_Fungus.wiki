A '''huge warped fungus''' is a large "tree" feature that generates in [[the Nether]].

== Generation ==
Huge warped fungi generate only in [[warped forest]]s.

== Blocks and items ==
These blocks can be obtained from the huge warped fungus:

* {{BlockLink|Warped Stem}}
* {{BlockLink|Warped Wart Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Shroomlight}}
* {{BlockLink|Warped Planks}} (created from a warped stem in the inventory crafting grid)

== Structure ==
The trunks of huge warped fungi are made of [[warped stem]]s. Huge warped fungus trunks can be either thick or thin: thick trunks grow up in a 3×3-plus shape, with stray stems sometimes in the corners, while thin trunks grow straight up as a 1×1 column. To determine the size of huge warped fungi, a random integer is chosen between 4 and 13 [inclusive]. There is then a {{frac|1|12}} chance of that integer doubling. The resulting value is the height of the trunk. A layer of wart blocks and [[shroomlight]]s is then spread around the trunk, being able to generate up to 3 blocks out from the trunk, and are the "leaves" of the fungus. There is a 3×3×2 hollow ring that surrounds the lowest block of a fungus where no blocks generate. They have shroomlights generate inside them, replacing both the wart blocks and stems.

== Growth ==
[[File:Small_Huge_Warped_Fungi.png|thumb|The smallest a huge fungus structure can be.]]
When bone meal is used on a [[warped fungus]] that is planted on [[warped nylium]], this has a 40% chance to grow into its huge equivalent (similar to saplings and mushrooms). The stem, shroomlight, or nether wart block do not replace blocks.

A fungus does not grow by itself through random ticks, unlike [[saplings]].

Huge warped fungi grow even with blocks above them,<ref>{{bug|MC-170858||Crimson and Warped trees do not check for empty space when growing|Works as Intended}}</ref> and do not replace any solid blocks when grown; however, they do not grow if blocked by the world height limit, or if situated outside of the world.

Huge warped fungi can grow up to 27 blocks tall. The maximum space they can take up is 9×27×9 blocks (partially hollow), and the average is 213 blocks of volume.

[[Warped wart block]]s and [[shroomlight]] persist when the stem of the huge fungus is removed, unlike how [[leaves]] decay when [[Log|logs]] of a tree are removed.
