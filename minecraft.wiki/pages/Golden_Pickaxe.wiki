A '''golden pickaxe''' is a variant of [[pickaxe]] that is crafted from [[gold ingots]]. It is the sixth-highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having the lowest durability, and having the lowest attack damage alongside [[wooden pickaxe]]s, despite having the highest [[mining efficiency]]. It has a [[mining level]] of 0, the same as a wooden pickaxe, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[stone]] and [[coal ore]]. It can be [[Piglin#Piglin loved items|admired]] by piglins, and has the highest [[enchantability]].

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
A golden pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a golden pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s.

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to [[recover]]. Golden pickaxes do {{hp|2}} damage per attack, or 2.4 damage per second, the same as a [[wooden pickaxe]].

==== {{BE}} ====
All pickaxes attack instantly, with golden pickaxes doing {{hp|3}} damage per attack, the same as a wooden pickaxe.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
{{Crafting

==== Anvil repair ====

{{Repairing

| Damaged Golden Pickaxe; Gold Ingot
| Golden Pickaxe
| tail=1
}}
A golden pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[gold ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A golden pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
