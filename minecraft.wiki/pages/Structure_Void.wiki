A '''structure void''' is an [[invisible block]] that is not saved by [[structure block]]s, allowing for the creation of structures that leave some existing blocks unchanged when loaded.

== Obtaining ==
Structure voids are available only using the {{cmd|setblock}}, {{cmd|fill}}, or {{cmd|give}} commands.

{{IN|Java}}, structure voids are also available in the [[Creative inventory]] if [[commands]] and {{UI|Options|Controls|[[Operator Items Tab]]}} is enabled.

== Usage ==
[[File:Shown Invisible Blocks.png|thumb|The difference between air (top left) and structure void (top right) when "show invisible blocks" is enabled.]]
Structure voids can be placed as part of a structure and are ignored when the structure file is saved. This results in the blocks at the location where the structure is placed being maintained and not being overridden. For example, if a player saves a 2 block high structure with air at the top and a structure void at the bottom, and loads it into a 2 block high area of stone, the top block becomes air but the bottom stays stone.

{{IN|JE}}, structure void blocks have no collision box but have a small hitbox. Additionally, they are invisible, but are displayed as pink cubes when "Show invisible blocks" is turned on in Save mode inside a [[Structure Block]]. Blocks can also replace structure voids similarly to [[snow]] and [[grass]]. A [[piston]] can move a structure void, but the structure void pushed by the piston turns into air.

{{IN|BE}}, structure void blocks' hitboxes are the same as a full [[block]], and, similar to barriers, appear when held by the player. Unlike ''Java Edition'', they can support blocks such as [[sign]]s, [[torch]]es, [[rail]]s and [[redstone wire]], but not gravity-affected blocks like [[sand]] or [[anvil]]s. A piston cannot move a structure void.

As there is no collision box, [[entities]] can pass through, although [[liquid]]s cannot.
