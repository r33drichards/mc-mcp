== Trivia ==
[[File:Creeper Spawning a1.2.3_05.png|thumb|Creepers being the only mob that spawns at night.]]
* When [[Notch]] released v1.2.4, he accidentally labeled it as v1.2.3_05 in game. This version also had leftover debug code that caused [[creeper]]s to be the only mob that would spawn. This was later fixed with the release of v1.2.4_01, which means there was never a client version of v1.2.4.<ref name="_05"/>
