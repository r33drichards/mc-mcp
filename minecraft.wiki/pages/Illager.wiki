[[File:All Illagers.png|thumb|Every illager in ''[[Java Edition|Minecraft: Java Edition,]]'' from left to right: a [[pillager]], a [[vindicator]], an [[evoker]], and an [[illusioner]].]]

'''Illagers'''<ref>"The Illagers were created because we were talking about having some kind of generic, evil soldier mob in the game—slightly more intelligent than skeletons. It felt natural to have an evil villager. We figured they were ill-willed villagers and so from the beginning they were supposed to be "Ill Villagers". And then Tommaso suggested they should be EVIL-agers—and then we cut it down to just Illagers."-[[Jens Bergensten]]-{{Mcnet|meet-vindicator|Meet the Vindicator|June 20, 2017}}</ref> are a type of [[hostile mob]] that regularly [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in [[woodland mansion]]s, [[patrol]]s, [[raid]]s, and [[pillager outpost]]s.  

Illagers are hostile toward [[player]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, [[snow golem]]s,{{only|BE|short=1}} and [[iron golem]]s. Illagers come in three (or four{{only|java|short=1}}) classes: [[pillager]], [[vindicator]], [[evoker]], and unused [[illusioner]].{{only|java|short=1}} {{IN|Java}}, all of these mobs are also part of the illager [[entity tag]]. All illagers are afraid of [[creaking]]s.

== Properties ==
All illagers share the following properties:
* They are classified as {{cd|Illager}} in the game code.
* "[[Easter eggs#"Johnny"|Johnny]]" vindicators do not attack the mob.
* The mob is immune to the [[Raid Omen]] effect.
* The mob cannot be damaged by [[evoker fangs]].
* The mob cannot be damaged by a [[ravager]]'s roar.
* The mob does not fight back when hit by an [[arrow]] shot by a [[pillager]] or [[illusioner]].
* The mob attacks villagers but ignores [[baby villager]]s, unlike [[Undead|zombie variants]] but if a vindicator is named Johnny they will attack them {{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
* The mob flees from [[creaking]]s.
* [[Witches]] heal the mob in [[raids]].
* They are part of the {{cd|#illager}} [[entity tag]].
* The mob can join [[patrol]]s.
* The mob can join [[raid]]s.
* The mob can spawn wearing an [[ominous banner]].
* They can ride [[ravager]]s.

== List of mobs ==
=== Illagers ===
* {{EntityLink|Evoker}}
* {{EntityLink|Illusioner}}{{only|java|short=1}}
* {{EntityLink|Pillager}}
* {{EntityLink|Vindicator}}

=== Affiliated mobs ===
* {{EntityLink|Ravager}}
* {{EntityLink|Vex}}
* {{EntityLink|Witch}}

Ravagers and vexes are also under the Illager section in the [[spawn egg]]s tab in the [[creative inventory]].

== Occurrences ==
Illagers spawn naturally in [[patrol]]s and [[raid]]s:
* Pillagers (including one patrol captain) spawn in patrols.
* Pillagers, vindicators and evokers spawn in raids.

They will also spawn in their respective [[structure]]s:
* Pillagers spawn in [[pillager outpost]]s.
* Vindicators and evokers spawn in [[woodland mansion]]s when they are generated.

The vindicators and evokers that spawn naturally in woodland mansions do not despawn. They also do not respawn when killed.

[[Illusioner]]s{{only|je|short=1}} do not spawn naturally and can be summoned only through commands.

=== Raid captains ===
{{main|Raid captain}}
Illagers sometimes have their own captain. All illagers have a small chance to be a [[raid captain]] wearing an [[ominous banner]] when spawned using a [[spawn egg]]{{only|java|short=1}} or when summoned by commands. 

Raid captains naturally spawn in raids{{only|java|short=1}}. One raid captain is spawned during each wave as the “leader” of that wave. When the raid captain is killed and drops its ominous banner, other nearby illagers attempt to pick up the banner to become the new raid captain.

One pillager raid captain (also called a patrol captain) spawns in patrols.

{{IN|JE}}, other illagers, ravagers and witches follow the orders of the raid captain, attacking any target the raid captain attacks.

{{IN|JE}}, the ominous banner equips on the illager's helmet slot. {{IN|BE}}, the ominous banner equips on the illager's chestplate slot.

=== Ravager jockeys ===
{{main|Ravager Jockey}}
An illager can spawn riding a ravager, creating a [[ravager jockey]]. The rider can be a pillager, vindicator, or evoker. {{IN|JE}}, illusioners can also be summoned as a ravager jockey through commands.

They naturally spawn only in certain waves during raids. {{IN|JE}}, the rider can also be a raid captain.

; ''Java Edition''
A pillager-ravager jockey spawns in wave 5. A vindicator-ravager jockey and an evoker-ravager jockey in wave 7. 1-2 vindicator-ravager jockeys and an evoker-ravager jockey also spawn in the extra wave (wave 8) in Hard [[difficulty]].

; ''Bedrock Edition''
A pillager-ravager jockey spawns in wave 5. A pillager-ravager jockey and an evoker-ravager jockey spawn in wave 7. 
Vindicator-ravager jockeys do not spawn during raids, and can be spawned only with commands.

=== Events ===
{{main|Patrol|Raid}}
Illagers have their own in-game events, led by raid captains{{only|JE|short=1}}:
* [[Patrol]] &mdash; a naturally spawned group of several [[pillagers]] led by a patrol captain roaming the landscape.
* [[Raid]] &mdash; an [[ominous event]] in which waves of illagers, ravagers and witches spawn and attack a [[village]] while an ominous horn blares. {{IN|JE}}, a raid captain spawns in each wave alongside the other illagers, usually with a vindicator as the captain. A raid is triggered when a player with the [[Bad Omen]] status effect enters a village, where it transforms into [[Raid Omen]] and starts the raid if not removed after 30 seconds. Raiders and villagers both have unique behaviors during a raid. {{IN|BE}}, any killed raiders drop special loot, such as [[armor]] and [[enchanted book]]s. The raiders and villagers celebrate after defeating or saving a village, respectively.

=== Effects ===
{{main|Bad Omen|Raid Omen|Hero of the Village}}
Killing a raid captain drops an [[ominous bottle]] of a random level (I-V), which when drank gives the player the [[Bad Omen]] effect of the same level. When that player enters a village, it becomes [[Raid Omen]]. If the Raid Omen effect is not removed, after 30 seconds a raid begins where the player obtained the Raid Omen. The level of the effect increases the enchantment power of pillagers' and vindicators' crossbows and axes, respectively, and omens with a level higher than 1 cause an extra wave of raiders to occur {{only|java|short=1}}.
When all waves have been defeated in a raid, the [[Hero of the Village]] effect is given, which decreases prices when trading with villagers. The level of the effect scales with the level of the omen that triggered the raid.

== Rune ==
{{Main|MCD:Illageralt}}
[[File:Illageralt alphabet.png|thumb|right|The illageralt alphabet.|link=Special:FilePath/Illageralt alphabet.png]]
Illagers have an alphabet called <code>illageralt</code>, a rune font from ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]''. This font is currently usable only {{in|java}} via commands.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
All illagers ignore baby villagers, but may still hit them by accident.

Illagers do not retaliate when hit by a missed [[arrow]] shot by a pillager or illusioner. 

A vindicator can disable the player's [[shield]] with its iron axe attack, even when riding a mob. If a player fails to land a melee attack on a vindicator that rides a [[ravager]] during a raid in Hard [[difficulty]], the vindicator rider can deal great damage to a player without protection from a shield.

All illagers, ravagers, and witches within 48 blocks of a [[bell]] that has been rung gain three seconds of the [[Glowing]] effect, effectively highlighting them through walls.

=== Reinforcements ===
On all difficulty levels, damaged illager mobs call all other illagers of their respective type within an area centered on the attacked illager to target the attacker, as long as the attacker is a non-illager. For example, nearby pillagers will attack a skeleton that injures another pillager, but pillagers do not aid a vindicator hit by a skeleton.{{more info|Penalty mechanics of the "likeliness to call reinforcement" of illagers. (Pillagers are not affected by this mechanic.)}}

=== Raids ===
During raids, [[vindicator]]s can open doors like [[villager]]s. They can also break [[wooden door]]s in Normal or Hard difficulty, if they cannot open the door successfully.<ref>{{bug|MC-255749||Non-raider vindicator cannot chop down wooden doors.}}</ref> Evokers and illusioners gain high movement speed without any effect.

A raid captain spawns in each wave with other raiders, usually with a vindicator as the captain.

Illagers pick up [[ominous banner]]s dropped by [[raid captain]]s and become the new raid captain. If the raid captain is still alive, they do not pick up a banner dropped from a previous wave or thrown by the player.

=== Patrols ===
All illagers, ravagers, and witches actively join nearby patrols. If a "Johnny" vindicator joins a patrol, all patrol members assume the "Johnny" vindicator's aggressive behavior.

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
All illagers and [[vex]]es ignore baby villagers, but pillagers may still shoot them by accident, But if a [[vindicator]] is named Johnny, then they kill them.

A [[dispenser]] can equip an evoker, vindicator, or pillager with [[armor]]. However, no armor is visible on them and no armor drops upon death.

[[Pillager]]s and ravagers do not purposefully attack other illagers. However, non-pillagers and non-[[ravager]]s do attack pillagers who hit them with missed [[arrow]]s.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-42373||Vindicators/Evokers attack Pillagers when hit by them}}</ref> Vindicators and evokers retaliate against a pillager if the pillager accidentally hits the vindicator or evoker with an arrow, although the evoker fang deals no damage to pillagers. Vexes summoned by an injured evoker can still attack the pillager.

A "[[Raid #Raid wave composition|ravager with vindicator rider]]" is unused {{in|bedrock}} and can only be summoned with the following command below:

{{Cd|code=/summon ravager ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_with_vindicator_rider}}

After the [[Texture Update]], illagers still use the [[Java Edition 1.14]] snapshot texture, including some of the Marketplace textures (for example, the pillager's arms).<ref>{{bug|MCPE-48628||Pillager has broken arm texture}}</ref> Also, a ravager's left leg texture {{in|be}} is different from that {{in|je}}, where it uses it's right leg texture instead.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* During the development of ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'', Mojang decided that the game needed a significantly larger number of hostile mobs than existed at the time. This lead to the creation of a generically evil faction in the illagers that could be used in any sort of spin-off media.<ref name=":0">[https://archive.org/details/minecraft-game-design/page/n41/mode/2up Minecraft Game Design]</ref>
** [[Jeb]] stated that illagers could have any agenda or skills necessary to fuel a story's plot. However, these skills should lean more toward being magic-oriented than technical.<ref name=":0" />
* According to ''[[Minecraft Books#Minecraft Mobestiary|Minecraft: Mobestiary]]'', illagers were "expelled" from villages due to their "unspeakable activities."
* [[Witch]]es ally with the illagers during raids. [[Cory Scheviak]] jokingly explained that witches spawned in raids are just along for the ride.<ref>{{bug|MC-182733|"Witches aren't illagers - they are just along for the ride!"|Cory Scheviak}}</ref>
* According to Jeb, illagers were originally called "ill-willed villagers" or "illvillagers", but "evillagers" and "illagers" were also suggested. The lattermost option was chosen as it was the shortest.<ref name=":0" />
** Following that, "illager" is "fybo" (bad villager) in Swedish, from "bybo" (villager), since it creates the same pun and meaning as the English term.<ref name=":0" />
* Apart from the evoker, all other illagers were originally designed with blue eyes. This includes the illager pattern on the [[ominous banner]], the early concept artwork for pillagers and their [[MCD:Pillager|variants]] in Minecraft Dungeons, and the illusioner in Java Edition. 
** Following the [[Texture Update]], the eye color of all illagers was uniformly changed to the evoker's green.
** In subsequent versions, only the vindicator's eye color was reverted to blue again.
