== Overlays ==

=== Suffocation ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Suffocation overlay
|image=Inside of a block.png
|camera=No
|hud=Yes
|graphics={{needs testing}}
|options=None
}}
{{conjecture|section=1}}
This effect manifests when an applicable mob or player's eye level intersects specific [[block]]s; generally those that are full solid cubes and block both vision and movement, with the exception of [[ice]].

{{IN|je}} this effect involves a darkened version of the block texture covering the entire area of the screen.

{{IN|be}}, the block's texture is instead arranged into a cube, and this cube is fixed around the player's point of view. This is the case regardless of the player's placement inside the block; they can be at the edge of it (such that their view is partially outside of it and the outside texture is clearly visible) and they are still rendered as if at the exact center of the cube.
{{-}}
=== On fire ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Fire overlay
|image=On fire.png
|camera=No
|hud=Yes
|graphics={{needs testing}}
|options=None
}}
{{conjecture|section=1}}
When the player is on [[fire]], this effect is applied to the screen. This is caused by being inside of [[fire]] or [[lava]] (even in [[Creative]] mode, although not in [[Spectator]]), after exiting such a block (except in Creative/Spectator), or being set on fire through the attack of a burning mob or a burning arrow.

This overlay always displays as [[fire]], even if the player in question is inside of soul fire.

{{IN|Java}} this effect involves two intersecting texture planes being rendered across the bottom half of the screen with the fire texture.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, a single fire texture is stretched across the bottom two-thirds of the screen.
{{-}}
=== Nether portal ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Nether Portal overlay
|image=Nether portal overlay.png
|camera={{jebe|Yes|No}}
|hud={{jebe|No|Yes}}
|graphics={{needs testing}}
|options=None
}}
{{conjecture|section=1}}
''Note: this section discusses the Nether portal texture overlay. The Nether portal/nausea wobble effect effect is discussed in the Distortion effect/Nausea sickness overlay sections.''

When the player is inside of a [[Nether portal]], this effect is applied to the screen. It always coincides with either the distortion effect and/or its overlay.

{{IN|je}} this effect involves the [[Nether portal]] texture being stretched across the entirety of the screen.

{{IN|be}}, the texture is instead arranged into a cube, fixed around the player's point of view much like the suffocation effect.
{{-}}

=== Underwater ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Underwater overlay
|image=Underwater overlay.png
|camera=No
|hud=Yes
|graphics={{needs testing}}
|options=None
}}
{{Expand section}}
The underwater effect is a blue vignette.
{{-}}
=== Nausea sickness overlay ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Nausea sickness overlay
|image=Distortion overlay.png
|camera=Yes
|hud=Yes
|graphics={{needs testing}}
|options=Settings
}}
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
This effect is a green vignette.

This effect appears only when the player has [[Nausea]], and the distortion effect is set to 0%. The effect gets more transparent as the slider is turned up, until 100% distortion, in which it disappears.
{{-}}

=== Darkness vignette ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Darkness vignette
|image=Vignette.png
|camera=Yes
|hud=No
|graphics=Fancy Minimum<ref>{{bug|MC-241321}}</ref>
|options=None
}}
This effect is a black circular blur at the corners. This effect is similar to a regular vignette. This effect appears usually in [[cave]]s, however it can appear in any dark place. It also appears when players are inside the structure of [[trial chamber]]s.
{{-}}

=== World border overlay ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=World border overlay
|image=World border overlay.png
|camera=Yes
|hud=No
|graphics=Fancy Minimum<ref>{{bug|MC-54988}}</ref>
|options=None
}}
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
The [[world border]] effect is red vignette. This effect gets more intense as the player gets closer to the world border. The effect maxes out when the player gets past the world border.
{{-}}
=== Freezing overlay ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Freezing overlay 
|image=Frozen effect.png
|camera=Yes
|hud={{Jebe|Yes|No}}
|graphics={{needs testing}}
|options=None
}}
The freezing overlay is a circular formation of crystals and snow flakes, appearing when frozen in [[powder snow]]. This effect slowly fades in until it is at full opacity.

If the player equips leather armor while freezing, this overlay slowly fades out, then disappears.
{{-}}
=== Pumpkin blur ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Carved pumpkin blur
|image=Pumpkin blur.png
|camera=No
|hud={{Jebe|No|Yes}}
|graphics=All
|options=None
}}
The pumpkin blur is a cutout shape of the carved pumpkin's face that appears when wearing a [[carved pumpkin]].
{{-}}
=== Spyglass scope ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title=Spyglass scope
|image=Spyglass scope.png
|camera=No
|hud={{Jebe|No|Yes}}
|graphics=All
|options=None
}}
The spyglass scope is a brown square in the middle of the screen that appears when using a [[spyglass]]. This scope effect quickly zooms in when using a spyglass, until the top and bottom are partly covered.
{{-}}

== Animated sprites and models ==

=== Mining Fatigue ===
{{Infobox screen effect
|title="Elder Guardian curse"
|image=Elder guardian curse.gif
|camera=Yes
|hud=Yes
|graphics=No
|options=None
}}
{{conjecture|section=1}}
When within a spherical radius of 50 blocks of an [[elder guardian]], the player is inflicted with [[Mining Fatigue]] III. This is indicated by a ghost of an elder guardian appearing in the players view, moving from the top of the screen to the bottom.

{{IN|Java}}, this occurrence is considered a particle effect and can be summoned with the {{cmd|particle minecraft:elder_guardian}} command.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, this occurrence is caused by a separate mob called the elder guardian ghost. However when summoned using {{cmd|summon
minecraft:elder_guardian_ghost}} it is invisible and rises to the sky.

The model of the elder guardian is used for this effect. This means that changing the texture and model associated with the elder guardian also changes what appears on the players screen.
{{-}}

=== Totem of Undying ===
{{Infobox screen effect|title=Totem of Undying|image=Totem of Undying Animation.gif|camera=Yes|hud={{jebe|No|Yes}}}}The effect is used when a totem of undying is popped (saved the player from a death). The totem spins to the middle of the screen and disappears. 
{{IN|Java}}, the totem of undying effect is a full 3D model. 
{{IN|Bedrock}}, the totem of undying effect is a 2D texture.
{{-}}

=== Hero of the Village ===
{{Infobox screen effect|title=Hero of the Village|image=Hero of the Village Bedrock Animation.gif|camera=Yes|hud=Yes}}
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
This effect appears when the player gets Hero of the Village from defeating a raid. This effect does not happen when the effect is given via commands. It is similar to the totem of undying effect.
{{-}}
=== Raid Omen ===
{{Infobox screen effect|title=Raid Omen|image=Raid Omen Bedrock Animation.gif|camera=Yes|hud=Yes}}
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
This screen effect appears when the player enters a village after getting Bad Omen. This effect does not appear when given via commands and looks similar to the totem of undying effect. This effect replaces the Bad Omen screen effect from before 1.21.
{{-}}

==Transformations==

===Damage tilt===
{{IN|Java}}, when the player receives damage, their screen tilts to the direction opposite of the entity or block who damaged the player. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, when the player receives damage, the view tilts to the right regardless of the damage direction.

===View bobbing===
This is a toggleable feature that adds a slight movement of the screen from left to right when walking. This also affects items and blocks in the players hand.

===Distortion effects===
This effect is seen when the player goes through a nether portal, or if the player has the nausea status effect. Different levels do not affect the distortion. However the effect can be affected by changing the distortion effect setting.{{Only|Java}}

===FOV based changes===
While sprinting, swimming or while affected by a speed effect, the FOV (field of view) increases. The FOV decreases when being affected by the slowness effect, while using a spyglass or by going into water or powder snow. The FOV can be changed in settings with a minimum of 30, and a maximum of 110. Different levels of slowness or speed do affect the FOV more.
