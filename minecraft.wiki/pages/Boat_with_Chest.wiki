'''Boats with chests''' (including '''bamboo rafts with chests''') are [[boat]]s with single [[chest]]s occupying their passenger seats. A boat's chest can be accessed by {{Control|using}} the boat while {{Control|sneaking}}, or while riding it.

== Obtaining ==
A boat with chest can be directly retrieved by attacking it, as it drops itself in item form, along with its contents.

[[Tool]]s and [[weapon]]s with damage above 4 can instantly destroy a boat with chest in one hit.{{only|Java}}

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|Chest
|Matching Boat
|Output=Matching Boat with Chest
|type=Transportation
}}

== Usage ==
A boat with chest can be used for the transportation of players, mobs and items, or as fuel when [[smelting]].

=== Fuel ===
A boat with chest can be used as fuel in a [[furnace]], lasting 60 seconds and smelting up to 6 items.

=== Transportation ===
{{main|Boat#Transportation}}

Boats with chests can carry only one entity while regular boats can carry up to two. The chest occupies the passenger seat. 

== Behavior ==
[[File:All Boats with Chests.png|alt=This photo shows all the types of boats with chests.|thumb|240px|All types of boats with chests.]]
{{main|Boat#Behavior}}
Boats with chests share most behaviors with boats.

=== Item storage ===
[[File:Boat with Chest GUI.png|thumb|176px|The GUI of a boat with chest.]]
The inventory of the boat with chest has the same amount of slots as a single chest. Its inventory can be accessed by {{Control|sneaking}} and {{Control|interacting}} with the boat with chest, {{control|interacting}} with the part of the boat with chest that actually contains the chest while another player or entity is inside the boat, or by opening the player's {{Control|inventory}} while inside the boat. This means that the player cannot access armor slots without exiting the boat.

When a boat with chest moves above, underneath, or beside a [[hopper]], its inventory is filled or drained accordingly. The size of its hitbox allows a boat with chest to be placed above up to nine hoppers so that it can evenly split its items nine ways.

=== Piglin ===
As with other chests, opening or breaking a boat with chest causes any nearby piglin(s) to attack the player.

== Sounds ==
{{JE}}:<br>
Boats with chests use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* A [[chest]] is short enough that a boat with chest falls onto it rather than crashes into it.
* The chest texture is 12×12 pixels, rather than the 14×14 pixel texture the block uses. This is not the case with the [[minecart with chest]].
* Despite the minecart with chest using the Christmas texture, the boat with chest still uses the default chest texture during Christmas time.<ref>{{bug|MC-249378}}</ref>
