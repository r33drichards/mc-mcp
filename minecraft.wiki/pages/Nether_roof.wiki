[[File:Nether Bedrock ceiling.png|thumb|The Nether roof, with [[Mushroom|red]] and [[brown mushroom]]s spotted around.]]
The '''Nether roof''' is the largely empty space ''above'' the [[bedrock]] ceiling of [[the Nether]]. In contrast to [[Void|the void]], the player does not take damage from the Nether roof.

{{IN|JE}}, the player can place blocks up to 128 blocks over the Nether roof. The Nether roof was once seen as a bug, but is now unofficially maintained by [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]].

{{IN|BE}}, it is not possible to build on top of the Nether roof. If the player manages to get there, they get teleported back into the main part of the Nether once reentering the world. As such, the space above the Nether ceiling is not usable.

== Accessing and exiting ==

{{main|Tutorial:Breaking bedrock}}

Because the Nether roof is technically unintended behavior and it is not possible to break [[Bedrock]] in normal gameplay, there is no proper way to access it. Therefore, bugs must be used to access the Nether roof; the most common way to do this is to teleport through the Bedrock blocks with [[ender pearl]]s.

Once on the roof, it can be exited by making a hole in the Bedrock layer or building [[Nether portal]]s. Both methods can be used to gain permanent access to it, since portals built on the roof can link to corresponding portals in the overworld.

== Generation ==
[[File:Nether roof VV.png|thumb|With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the Nether roof has red ambient lighting.]]
The Nether roof is completely flat, consisting of only a layer of bedrock. No mobs can spawn, since mobs do not spawn on [[Bedrock]].

{{IN|JE}}, brown and red [[mushroom]]s can be found on this Bedrock layer.

The Nether roof does not have its own [[biome]]. Instead, its biome depends on the biome under the roof and the lighting changes with the biome as it would below the Bedrock layer.

== Usage ==
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Due to the amount of empty space available and the [[Mob spawning#Spawn cycle|mob spawning rules]], the Nether roof is especially advantageous for building farms that require mob spawns. Examples for farms commonly built on the Nether roof include [[Tutorial:Hoglin farming|hoglin farms]], [[Tutorial:Zombified Piglin farming|gold farms]], and [[Tutorial:Bartering farm|bartering farms]].

The Nether roof is also useful for building transportation networks. The Nether allows for 8 times shorter travel distances, and by building Nether portals, it is possible to travel quickly between destinations using ice highways or other methods of [[transportation]]. Although it is possible to do this below the Nether roof as well, building these transportation systems on the roof is easier, since there is less terrain and there are no natural mob spawns.

==Trivia==
*During [[Minecraft LIVE – March 2025]], when the developers talked about the new [[happy ghast]], one of them suggested some uses for the new mob. High-altitude builds on the Nether roof were among the mentioned suggestions.
