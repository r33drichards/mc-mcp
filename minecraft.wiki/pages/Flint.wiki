'''Flint''' is a mineral obtained from [[gravel]] that can be used to craft a [[Flint and Steel|flint and steel]], [[Fletching Table|fletching table]], and [[Arrow|arrows]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Mining ===
When a block of [[gravel]] is mined, there is a 10% chance for a single piece of flint to drop instead of the [[gravel]] block. When mined with a [[Fortune]]-enchanted tool, this chance increases to 16% at Fortune I, 25% at Fortune II, and 100% at Fortune III. Gravel mined using a tool with [[Silk Touch]] or gravel that fell on a non-solid block never produces flint.
