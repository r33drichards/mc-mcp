[[File:Enchanted Iron Pickaxe.gif|thumb|The glint animation applied to an enchanted [[iron pickaxe]].]]
'''Enchantment glint''' is a visual effect applied most often to [[enchanted]] items and equipment, as well as other important items such as the [[End crystal]] and [[Nether star]].

== Summary ==
Important items such as the [[enchanted golden apple]] (which is not actually an item with enchantments), [[Nether star]], [[End crystal]], [[bottle o' enchanting]], [[lodestone compass]], [[written book]], and [[debug stick]], as well as any item with an enchantment, will display a glint effect.

Equipped enchanted [[armor]] and [[carved pumpkin]]s also display a glint when equipped.

While not enchantable in normal survival gameplay, [[horse armor]], [[nautilus armor]], [[wolf armor]], llama [[carpet]]s, [[saddle]]s, and [[harness]]es when equipped by their respective [[mob]](s) will also display the glint effect.

[[Chest]]s on [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, and [[llama]]s do not display the glint effect.<ref>{{bug|MC-279564}}</ref> Held or framed [[map]]s also do not display it.<ref>{{bug|MC-298757}}</ref>

=== Animation generation ===
{{info needed section|explain how the animation works}}
Unlike most animations in the game, which are defined through mcmeta files, the enchantment glint's generation is hardcoded and cannot be fully modified.

Interestingly, the enchantment glint's rendering is tied to the size of the atlas.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|276841|Enchantment glint rendering depends on the current size of the texture atlas|date=September 19, 2024|resolution=Unresolved}}</ref> This causes interesting visual effects, for example, if all of the game's textures are unloaded:
