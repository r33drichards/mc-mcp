'''Armored Paws''' is a [[game drop]] released on April 23, 2024, as [[Java Edition 1.20.5]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.80]].<ref>{{Mcnet|armored-paws|Shy Friends and Armored Paws|April 23, 2024|Cristina Anderca}}</ref> It focuses on adding content voted for during [[Minecraft Live 2023]] by adding [[armadillo]]s, [[wolf armor]], and 8 new [[wolf]] variants. Armadillos spawn in [[badlands]], [[savanna]]s, and their variants. They can be brushed for [[armadillo scute]]s, which can be crafted into wolf armor. The new wolf variants spawn in various biomes, including three biomes that wolves did not spawn in before: [[savanna plateau]], [[sparse jungle]], and [[wooded badlands]].
