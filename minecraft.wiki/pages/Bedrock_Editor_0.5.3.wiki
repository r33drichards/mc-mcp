'''Bedrock Editor v0.5.3''' is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on January 24, 2024, which tweaks the API and fixes bugs.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/23458154786829#h_01HMVQTXE9S2EZSP0T130M9A5P</ref><ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/164</ref>

== Changes ==
* The {{cd|PropertyPane.addDropdown}} function now returns an {{cd|IDropdownPropertyItem}} that can be used to call the new {{cd|updateDropdownItems}} to change the Dropdown items in an existing Dropdown and optionally set a new currently-selected index.
** {{cd|updateDropdownItems}} calls the corresponding {{cd|onChange}} function but passes {{cd|-1}} in for the {{cd|oldValue}} because the list is changing entries.
* Added Cursor delta relative to Player position and the name of the block at the cursor position to the Player position status bar entry.
* {{cd|Vector3}} panes now have a default {{cd|minX/Y/Z}} of {{cd|MIN_SAFE_INTEGER}}, allowing negative values to be used.

== Fixes ==
* The player will now correctly spawn at the current location when the “Spawn at current location” option is checked in the test world property pane.
* Viewport in the editor is no longer incorrectly offset while in a world with deferred graphics enabled.
