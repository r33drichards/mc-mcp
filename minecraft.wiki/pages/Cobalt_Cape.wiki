This website still works, but many of the tournaments, all of which are listed as taking place in early 2016, are still marked as incomplete, suggesting that this website was abandoned before the tournament series finished.

== Trivia ==
* The design of the cape's elytra texture is based on a wasp enemy from ''Cobalt''.<ref>{{reddit|6knyx5/my_elytra_texture_looks_like_insect_wings_by|djnrxgr|context=3|It's the wings of the wasp!|jeb_|July 1, 2017}}</ref>
