'''Snowfall''' is a type of [[weather]] that occurs occasionally in ''[[Minecraft]]''.

== Behavior ==
Snowfall is a temporary, biome-specific occurrence that can happen randomly at any time in [[Biome|snowy biomes]]. It only occurs above a certain height in biomes like [[windswept hills]] and [[taiga|taigas]]. Snowfall also occurs in [[frozen ocean]] biomes, where it occurs in certain locations, while it rains in others, as a result of a temperature gradient within the biome. In lush biomes, snowfall can occur only at layers above the block height limit. Snowfall does not exist in hot/dry biomes and in other [[dimension]]s.

Below are the [[altitude]]s at which rain ends and snow begins, depending on the biome. The exact height of the snow line is randomized: for examples in taigas, the lowest possible snow layer forms at y level 153, and the minimum height where snow forms at all locations is y level 168, with snow lines ranging between y levels 153 and 168 across different locations.

The average snowfall lasts 0.5–1 [[Daylight cycle#Conversions|''Minecraft'' day]], and there is a 0.5–7.5 day delay between snowstorms. Snowstorms have a small chance to worsen into [[thunderstorm]]s, which keep the effects from both weather types.

== Effects ==
[[File:Snowfalltundra.png|thumb|250px|Snow falling in a snowy taiga {{In|je}}.]]
[[File:Snowing BE.jpg|thumb|250px|Snow falling in a snowy taiga in ''Bedrock Edition''.]]

Snowstorms darken the world, causing the [[light]] from the [[sun]] to decrease by 3, bringing it to light level 12 in full daylight. [[Moon]]light, however, is not reduced, and remains at light level 4. {{IN|je}}, the sky darkens in all biomes with different colors (see {{Slink|Sky|Colors}} for a full list). {{IN|be}}, the sky turns to {{Color|rgb(103, 103, 103)}} in all biomes. The clouds darken from white to light gray (95% {{Color|rgb(191, 191, 191)}} blended with regular colors in ''Bedrock Edition''), but they do not precipitate. [[Fog]] is colored {{Color|#666666}} ({{Color|#403C44}} in [[pale gardens]]), and is much denser, decreasing view distance by 30%. While the sun is not visible during snowfall, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.

{{IN|be}}, all [[leaves]] that are exposed to the sky in snowy biomes, with the exception of cherry, pale oak, and azalea, slowly change from green to white once snowfall begins and for its duration, giving them a frosted appearance. Leaves placed after this transition has occurred for a particular snowfall cycle appear frosted as soon as they are placed. Leaf [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particles]] also turn white during snowfall, with the same colors as leaves.

When it snows, [[Snow|snow layers]] regenerate over all blocks with a solid top surface at integer y-values.<ref>{{tweet|notch|55919635593306112|@zadirion Ice and snow will regrow, farms will autowater|April 7, 2011}}</ref> {{IN|be}}, these snow layers naturally accumulate over time, with each biome having its own set of values determining how much or how little snow can be accumulated through snowfall. Once snow accumulates to the maximum height allowed in a specific biome, it reverts itself back to the biome's minimum and starts over. {{IN|java}}, snowfall creates one layer of snow by default, and the number of layers that can accumulate can be altered by the [[game rule]] {{cd|snowAccumulationHeight}}: setting it to {{cd|0}} makes no snow form at all, and setting it to {{cd|8}} or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block. Snow can also generate [[snowlogged]] in certain types of vegetation in ''Bedrock Edition''.

=== Snow particles ===
Falling snowflake [[particle]] effects are visible through the air over all cold regions during snowfall. Unlike with rain, any entities that are on [[fire]] are not extinguished on contact with snow. {{IN|JE}}, snowflakes fall in the two middle lines of a block; they do not visibly fall directly onto the [[player]]. {{IN|BE}}, snow particles can fall twisting, bending, and moving around, independent of a block.

On the border of a snowy biome and rainy biome, snowfall gradually transforms into rainfall up to eight blocks from the border in ''Bedrock Edition''. This also happens when the biomes border each other in vertical direction, and has no influence on snow generation or melt. In ''Java Edition'', no transition between biomes exists at all and the border between snowfall and rainfall is visible on the edge of single blocks.

In ''Bedrock Edition'', stony shores and dripstone caves allow snowfall to border biomes with no precipitation at higher altitudes. While nearing a dry biome, the density of snow particles decreases and the sky brightens. At the border of rainfall, snowfall, and no precipitation, rain and snow particles are both visible with a lower density.

=== Powder snow ===
During snowfall, [[cauldron]]s under the sky slowly fill with [[powder snow]].

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|be}}, snow falls one block into the [[void]] (Y=-65). This can be seen in creative mode by floating in the void.
* Snow still falls above the clouds. Notch's explanation is that the gray above the clouds during a storm is another layer of clouds and the origin of the snow.<ref>{{tweet|notch|130230769347067905|@carnalizer there's another layer of clouds above the low one! That's why the sky turns gray.|October 29, 2011}}</ref>
* At extremely high Y values, snow appears to fall more slowly and the texture of the snow particles becomes vertically stretched. The slowed falling speed becomes noticeable at around Y=200000, while the vertical stretching effect becomes noticeable around Y=1000000
