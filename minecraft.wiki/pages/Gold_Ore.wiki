'''Gold ore''' is a rare [[mineral]] block found underground that drops [[raw gold]] when mined with an iron pickaxe or better.

'''Deepslate gold ore''' is a variant of gold ore that can generate in [[deepslate]] and [[tuff]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Gold ore drops one [[raw gold]] if mined by an [[iron pickaxe]] or higher. If mined by any other [[tool]], it drops nothing. Mining with a [[Silk Touch]] pickaxe drops itself. It is affected by [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1–2, 1–3, or 1–4 raw gold respectively with Fortune I, II, and III.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}

Gold ore can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of ore features. 

Gold ore attempts to generate in two batches. The first batch generates 4 times per chunk in blobs of 0—13 blocks, from levels -64 to 32. It is most likely to be found around layer -16, becoming less common toward either end of the range. The second batch has a probability of 1/2 per chunks to generate in blobs of 0—13 blocks that generate uniformly between -64 and -48. There is also an extra batch of gold ore in [[Badlands|badlands biomes]] that generates 50 times per chunk in blobs of 0—13 blocks, from 32 to 256 uniformly. Gold ore is also less likely to be exposed to air: 50% of ore blocks from the first and second batch do not generate. The extra batch in badlands generate regardless of exposure to air. 

Gold ore can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. Any gold ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate gold ore.

{{Block distribution}}

== Usage ==
The primary usage of gold ore is to [[#Breaking|mine]] it for [[raw gold]].

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s become hostile toward players who mine gold ore, even if the player is wearing golden [[armor]] or under the [[Invisibility]] effect. Piglins also run toward any gold ore item on the ground, and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory.

=== Note blocks ===
Gold ore can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
