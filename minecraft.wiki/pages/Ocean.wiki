The '''ocean''' is an aquatic [[biome]] consisting of [[water]]. They are deep bodies of water with the surface at an [[altitude]] of Y=63 by default, which is counted as the “sea level” of the world.

== Description ==
[[File:Ocean colors.png|thumb|200px|The separate colors of each ocean variant {{in|java}}.]]
Oceans are vast expanses of [[water]] that start at the sea level and end at the ocean floor, which is at a depth of roughly Y=45 for normal oceans and Y=30 for deep variants. The seafloor is fairly hilly, featuring multiple peaks and valleys, and is mostly covered by a one-block layer of [[gravel]] or [[sand]], though some [[clay]], [[dirt]], [[gravel]], and [[sand]] patches may generate near the peaks. [[Canyon]]s can occasionally generate on the ocean floor, forming underwater trenches. Some seafloor peaks may be high enough to form islands on the ocean surface; these islands are typically small and may have very sparse vegetation, with little grass and few oak trees. The seafloor is often covered with [[seagrass]] and [[kelp]], with “forests” of kelp frequently reaching close to or even touching the water's surface. [[Fish]], [[squid]], and [[dolphin]]s frequently spawn within oceans. [[Shipwreck]]s and [[ocean ruins]] generate within all oceans, while deep ocean variants can occasionally generate [[ocean monument]]s. The regular ocean variant mainly generates adjacent to land, while deep variants generate farther from land.

Survival in ocean biomes is impractical because of all the [[water]]. A player who camps on an island in the ocean faces a rather difficult situation. This means that whatever resources are found on an island might be all the player has if the player is unwilling or unable to venture out. See the [[Tutorial:Island survival|island survival]] article for more information.

== Sounds ==
In any ocean biome, unique ocean [[ambience]] plays randomly. Normal overworld tracks also play, alongside “[[Axolotl (song)|Axolotl]]”, “[[Dragon Fish]]”, and “[[Shuniji]]”, as the requirements for those are merely to be underwater, regardless of biome.
