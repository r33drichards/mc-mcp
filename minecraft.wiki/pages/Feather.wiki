'''Feathers''' are items dropped by [[chicken]]s and [[parrot]]s, as well as tamed [[cat]]s as [[Cat#Gifts|morning gifts]].

== Obtaining ==

{{Drop sources|Feather}}

A [[fox]] sometimes spawns holding a feather, which always drops upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a [[food]] item, causing the fox to drop the feather in favor of the food.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|feather}}

=== Cat gifts ===
{{main|Cat#Gifts}}
Tamed [[cat]]s have a 70% chance of giving the [[player]] a "morning gift", and the gift has a 16.13% chance to be a feather.

{{exclusive|java|section=yes}}
Although a feather cannot be equipped in the head slot in [[Survival]] mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear to be rotated upright unlike other items.
