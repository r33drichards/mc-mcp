A '''loom''' is a [[block]] used to apply customizable and layerable designs to [[banner]]s using [[dye]]s. Some designs require [[banner pattern]]s to apply. It also serves as a [[shepherd]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A loom can be mined using any [[tool]] or by hand, but [[axe]]s are the quickest. It always drops as an item.

=== Natural generation ===
Looms can be found in [[village]] shepherd houses. Looms can also generate in [[trail ruins]].

{{control|Using}} on a loom opens its interface. It has three slots for a [[banner]], a [[dye]], and an optional [[banner pattern]] item. When a banner is put in, a list of patterns appears in the center part. Ten patterns require the following banner patterns: Flower Charge, Creeper Charge, Skull Charge, Thing, Snout, Globe, Field Masoned, Bordure Indented, Flow, and Guster. Putting a banner pattern in its respective slot makes the loom show only that pattern.

Selecting a pattern or using a banner pattern on the list shows the preview of the banner after applying, if a dye is present. To finish, the player must take the banner in the slot beneath the preview. The original banner and the dye disappear from their respective slots, but the banner pattern is not consumed.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a loom has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to shepherd and claim the loom as their [[job site block]].

=== Fuel ===
A loom can be used as fuel in a [[furnace]] to smelt 1.5 items.

=== Note blocks ===
Looms can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
