[[File:Loading Screen Legacy Console_Edition.png|thumb|A tip displayed on the loading screen.]]

'''Loading tips''' are shown on the world loading screen in [[Legacy Console Edition]].

== List ==
{{info needed section|the version each tip was added (like on the [[Splash]] page)}}
{{missing information|section|minigame-specific tips and IDs}}
{{missing information|Numbers shown to see how many}}

<!--These tips were gathered by sitting and taking screenshots for about 10 minutes on the Switch "transfer world" screen, which will endlessly cycle through tips as long as an actual transfer isn't started. It's not based directly on the game data, so these are almost certain to be in the wrong order and it's possible I missed some.-->
