A '''pillager''' is an [[illager]] armed with a [[crossbow]] found in wandering [[patrol]]s, in [[pillager outpost]]s, or as a participant in [[raid]]s. It attacks by firing arrows at the player.

== Spawning ==
{{IN|JE}}, a pillager spawned by a player using a [[spawn egg]] or [[command]]s can be a captain, which has an [[ominous banner]] in their [[Slot|head slot]], which displays as attached to the back of their head.

=== Patrols ===
{{IN|java}}, the number of pillagers [[Mob spawning|spawn]]ing in each [[patrol]] varies from one to five and depends on the [[regional difficulty]], with one spawning as a [[raid captain|patrol captain]]. Patrols occur after 5{{frac|1|2}} in-game days, any time and independently of structures, which means they still spawn in worlds without [[generated structure]]s. A patrol spawns 24 to 48 blocks away from a random player, on the highest solid block. The individual pillagers of a patrol can spawn only at block [[light]] level less than 9, regardless of sky light.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, each patrol spawns two to five pillagers with one spawning as a patrol captain. After 5{{frac|1|2}} in-game days, patrols appear 24 to 48 blocks away from the [[player]], at a light level of 0-7.

=== Pillager outposts ===
Pillagers continually spawn in a 72×54×72 [[block]] volume centered on the top floor in a [[pillager outpost]]. Some pillagers spawn as outpost captains. They may spawn on any valid opaque block if the block light level is less than or equal to 8. 

{{IN|java}}, there can be unlimited pillagers that spawn in outposts naturally, limited only by the natural spawning rules.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, pillagers continually spawn at or below a particular location in the outpost, choosing the highest opaque block with a non-solid block on top and spawning on the northwest corner. A maximum of eight pillagers spawn naturally in an outpost.

=== Raids ===
In a [[raid]], pillagers are more common in the earlier waves and decrease in number as the waves progress. Despite this, they still constitute the majority of raiders in total. 

One pillager spawns riding a [[ravager]] in the fifth wave. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, one of the ravagers is ridden by a pillager instead of a [[vindicator]] in the seventh wave.

{{IN|java}}, pillagers spawn during bonus waves and have the largest chance of being the raid captain in the first wave, but in the second wave and onward, vindicators have a greater chance than pillagers of being the [[raid captain]].

}}
==== Guaranteed drops ====
When a pillager spawns as a raid captain, it always drops their [[ominous banner]] on death, while equipped. [[Armor]] equipped by [[dispenser]]s always drop on death. {{IN|je}}, the armor's durability won't be affected by damage. {{IN|be}}, the armor's durability is still vulnerable to attacks, as if a player is wearing it.

==== Naturally-spawned equipment ====
Pillagers have a 8.5% chance to drop a [[crossbow]] when killed by the [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]]. The crossbow may be loaded or unloaded depending on the crossbow's state when the pillager dies. The drop chance increases by 1% per level of [[Looting]]. The crossbow is of a random [[durability]] and has a chance of being enchanted. The chance ranges from 0% to 10% depending on the [[regional difficulty]]. The enchantment level is from 5 to 19.

==== Experience ====
{{xp|5}} [[experience]] points and an additional {{xp|1|3}} points per naturally-spawned equipment drop when killed by the player or a tamed wolf, if the pillager does not drop their naturally-spawned equipment.

== Behavior ==
Pillagers move slowly when wandering or loading crossbows {{In|je}}. {{IN|be}}, pillagers move from one place to another as fast as when they're provoked.

In ''Java Edition'', pillagers point their crossbows at any player or mob they are looking at, whether their crossbows are loaded or unloaded. In ''Bedrock Edition'', pillagers only point their crossbows to other mobs when it is loaded.

Pillagers flee from [[Creaking|creakings]] when within a range of 8 blocks.

=== Hostility ===
Pillagers are hostile toward [[player]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[wandering trader]]s and adult [[villager]]s. Pillagers also aid other pillagers attacked by other mobs. [[Illager|Illagers]] do not retaliate at each other. A pillager that accidentally harms another neutral/hostile mob (except goats) causes the mob to retaliate against the pillager.

A pillager attacks by shooting [[arrow]]s from its [[crossbow]] every three seconds from up to eight [[block]]s away and sees enemies for up to 32 blocks {{in|java}} or 16 blocks {{in|bedrock}}.

{{IN|je}}, if a pillager gets attacked by a mob (excluding [[illager]]s and goats) or player, it alerts other pillagers to target the attacker, regardless of distance, unless the pillager was killed in one hit.

[[File:Passive Pillager.png|thumb|left|A passive pillager holding an [[banner|ominous banner]] in the right hand.]]
A pillager does not attack the player if summoned with [[commands]] {{in|bedrock}} using the <code>minecraft:calm</code> attribute.

When a player is in [[Creative]] mode or applied with the [[Invisibility]] effect, getting near a pillager still causes it to take notice and stare at the player. If a pillager notices an enemy while staring at the player, the pillager stops staring and attacks the enemy. If a player with the invisibility effect attacks a pillager, the pillager still retaliates.

=== Patrols ===
[[File:Pillager Staring.png|alt=A pillager creature is shown staring at a player in creative mode and pointing its crossbow toward.|thumb|A pillager stares at the player and points its crossbow toward them when they're in creative mode or have the [[Invisibility]] effect.]]
The patrol captain wears an [[ominous banner]] on its head. The other illagers follow the captain around. The pillagers that are part of a [[patrol]] do not attack immediately. The patrol members' heads turn to follow the player or mob who attracted their attention. Players or villager-like mobs attacking or approaching within ten blocks of the patrol members provokes them into loading their crossbows and attacking.<ref name="MC-148387">{{bug|MC-148387}}</ref>

=== Raids ===
If raiding pillagers kill all the villagers in a [[village]] or all [[bed]]s are destroyed, they celebrate their victory by jumping and laughing. Unarmed pillagers also cheer. {{IN|bedrock}}, pillagers wave their arms while holding their crossbows in their main hand when cheering.

During a raid, pillagers equip ominous banners dropped on the ground within 3 blocks, but non-raider pillagers don't.

=== Crossbow usage ===
==== ''Java Edition'' ====
11% of pillagers use [[Crossbow|crossbows]] on their [[off-hand]].

Pillagers load their crossbows when their target is within a 8 block radius and shoot when the target is within its pursuing radius, which is 64 blocks.

The command <code>/summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {}</code> summons a passive pillager, without a crossbow, that does not attack.

A pillager's [[crossbow]] eventually breaks after 465 uses without the [[Unbreaking]] enchant, unlike weapons wielded by other mobs.<ref name="MC-163960">{{bug|MC-163960|||WAI}}</ref> Unarmed pillagers are passive toward all entities, but they still frighten [[villager]]s and [[iron golem]]s are still hostile toward them. This behavior is included to pillagers that have any other item that isn't a crossbow.

A pillager spawned with arrows or [[firework rocket]]s in its off-hand slot uses them, depleting the stack over time and switching to regular arrows once running out of ammunition.<ref name="MC-145121">{{bug|MC-145121}}</ref> When firing firework rockets, pillagers aim above the target as when using arrows, despite rockets being unaffected by gravity.<ref name="MC-145114">{{bug|MC-145114}}</ref>

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
Pillagers cannot use their crossbows in their off-hand, as mobs cannot use weapons in their off-hand, just like players.
[[File:Java Pillager and Bedrock Pillager texture.png|thumb|left|The differences between the pillager texture in Java Edition (left) and Bedrock Edition (right).]]
Pillagers use an outdated behavior.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-143949||Pillager Outdate AI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-137755||Pillagers are near enemies when attacking|Fixed}}</ref> They also have different arm textures.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-48628||Pillager has broken arm texture in BE}}</ref> Newly-spawned pillagers hold their crossbow in a lowered position similar to [[piglin]]s until they start attacking a target, in which they raise their weapon. Pillagers load their crossbows when their target is at its pursuing radius, which is 16 blocks, and only shoot when the target is within a 8 block radius. After loading their crossbows, they begin to chase down the target endlessly, being slower than in ''Java Edition.'' Pillagers are not hostile to players before their crossbows are loaded, so sometimes they don't look at players or run around while loading their crossbows. 

A [[dispenser]] can equip a pillager with [[armor]]. However, it isn't rendered on the pillager's model. If a player summons a pillager without a crossbow by [[spawn event]] or [[Commands/replaceitem|replaceitem]] command, it still shoots arrows to attack targets, like other arrow-shooting ranged mobs. This is due to the fact that in the <samp>pillager.json</samp> and <samp>ranged piglin.json</samp> files, the <code>component_groups</code> have both <code>minecraft:behavior.ranged_attack</code> and <code>minecraft:behavior.charge_held_item</code>, so if a pillager does not have a crossbow, the <code>charge_held_item</code> behavior cannot trigger and it continuously shoots arrows due to the <code>ranged_attack</code> behavior. This results in the arrows being shot more quickly without a crossbow than with one.

Unlike {{In|je}}, the crossbows of pillagers {{in|bedrock}} don't break.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-67489||Pillager doesn't break their crossbow}}</ref>

Pillagers do melee attacks while underwater, unlike pillagers in ''Java Edition'' that maintain using crossbows underwater, where the shot arrows travel slower underwater and sink after a short distance.

== Bad Omen ==
Whenever a [[raid captain|pillager captain]] dies, an [[ominous bottle]] of a random level from 1 to 5 is always dropped. Drinking the bottle gives the player [[Bad Omen]]. The effect lasts for 100 minutes (five in-game days) and can be removed by drinking [[milk]]. When a player afflicted with Bad Omen enters a [[village]], the effect converts to [[Raid Omen]]. When [[Raid Omen]] runs out after 30 seconds, a [[raid]] commences in that village, bringing about waves of illagers that seek and try to kill all [[villager]]s.

[[Bad Omen]] can also be used to start [[ominous trial]]s.

Each [[patrol]] spawns one pillager captain, meanwhile [[pillager outpost]]s can continually spawn pillager captains. 

[[Raid captain]]s do not drop [[ominous bottle]]s while participating in a [[raid]].

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Alongside [[crossbows]], pillagers were taken from [[Minecraft Dungeons]], even though they were added to the base game first.<ref>{{cite Discord|url=https://discord.com/channels/579770991056519194/818903542139453480/819631528593588244| title = March 2021 developper Q&A|date=March 11, 2021}}</ref>
* Pillagers were added in [[Village & Pillage]] as a means to give villagers a "true" adversary in order to balance the new village mechanics.<ref>{{mcnet|meet-pillagers|Meet the Pillagers|April 13, 2019|Per Landin}}</ref>
* An original design of the pillager appeared like a pirate wearing an orange vest. However, Mojang Studios' mob designers changed the mob's design to look more like brigandine armor.
* {{IN|bedrock}}, a running pillager uses the player's running animation rather than that of other [[illager]]s.
* Summoning an unarmed pillager in ''Java Edition'' that is invulnerable (<code>/summon pillager ~ ~ ~ {Invulnerable:1b}</code>) does not cause villagers to run away from the pillager.
