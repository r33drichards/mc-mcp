'''Mob trophy''' is a block added in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Obtaining ==
Any mob has a 10% chance to drop its corresponding trophy when killed by a player. A shiny netherite grade llama spit mob trophy can also be found in the stairs room, which requires multiple +1 jump Player Unlocks to access. Also, in the labyrinth room, there is a chest filled with 18 diamond grade lightning mob trophies.

Trophies can also be obtained with the give command, using components to display specific mobs. Below is an example command to spawn a shiny, netherite grade ender dragon mob trophy:

{{cmd|1=give @s mob_trophy[minecraft:mob_trophy/type={shiny:1b,type:"ender_dragon"},minecraft:block_state={grade:"netherite"}]}}

The tag <code>shiny:1b</code> gives the trophy the 'shiny' trait. Replace with <code>shiny:0b</code> to remove shininess.

The tag <code>{grade:"netherite"}</code> makes the trophy netherite-grade.

The tag <code>type:"ender_dragon"</code> sets the trophy's mob to an [[ender dragon]].

== Usage ==
Right-clicking a mob trophy plays a random sound from its corresponding mob.

== Grades ==
Every mob trophy has a grade when it drops. The probabilities of the different grades are:
* {{frac|100|181}} ≈ 55.2% chance of grass grade
* {{frac|50|181}} ≈ 27.6% chance of stone grade
* {{frac|25|181}} ≈ 13.8% chance of gold grade
* {{frac|5|181}} ≈ 2.8% chance of diamond grade
* {{frac|1|181}} ≈ 0.6% chance of netherite grade
Additionally, there is a 1% ({{frac|1|100}}) chance for a mob trophy to be shiny. The rarest mob trophy, a shiny netherite grade mob trophy, has only a {{frac|1|181000}} ≈ 0.0006% chance of dropping from any mob kill.
