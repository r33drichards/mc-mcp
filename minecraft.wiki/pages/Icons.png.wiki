{{DISPLAYTITLE:<samp>icons.png</samp>}}
{{wip}}{{Exclusive|bedrock}}{{Outdated feature|edition=java}}<samp>'''icons.png'''</samp> is a texture sheet used by the game to store the textures of several UI elements.
[[File:201511110718_icons.png|thumb|The latest icons.png file in {{BE}}.]]

== Content ==
<samp>icons.png</samp> contains the sprites of older UI elements, including [[health]], [[hunger]], [[experience]], and [[armor]].

{{IN|je}}, unlike a large amount of texture sheets, it was still used until recent updates. However, it has now been split into multiple files in the hud folder (assets/minecraft/textures/gui/sprites/hud).

The following image map shows how the elements are used when hovered over. Several of them are unused and therefore have no label.<ref>{{cite|date=April 2016|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g83uC9-sVpaSPghGSsTYYngDS2tbseDkW6ZRgGmadp8/edit?usp=sharing |title=The GUIde}}</ref>

There are a few additional invisible textures that have alpha set to zero but still have color data.
