=== Items ===
'''[[Shield]]s'''
* Durability increased from 181 to 337.<!-- 0 durability still has one additional use -->

=== World generation ===
'''[[Obsidian pillar]]'''
* Some of the pillars now generate with iron bars again, which was removed in 16w07a.

== Trivia ==
* Interestingly, the release date for 1.9-pre1 was (though not confirmed by Mojang themselves) hinted at in the [[16w06a]] blog post in the hotbar, where the wool values corresponded to the numbers 1, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 6, which represented the date February 17th, 2016 - the day this was released.
* 1.9-pre1 was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
