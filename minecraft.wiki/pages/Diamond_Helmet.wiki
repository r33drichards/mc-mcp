A '''diamond helmet''' is a variant of [[helmet]] that is crafted from [[diamond]]s. It is the second-highest [[tier]] of helmet, having higher armor points, armor toughness, durability, and [[enchantability]] than [[turtle shell]]s. It can be upgraded into a [[netherite helmet]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have a very small chance to spawn wearing diamond armor. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the helmet they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped helmet is usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources|Enchanted Diamond Helmet}}

== Usage ==
When worn, a diamond helmet provides {{armor|3}} [[armor points]] and {{armor|2}} [[armor toughness]].

A diamond helmet can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[diamond]]s, with each diamond restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's [[enchantment]]s.

==== Repair ====
Diamond helmets may be [[repair]]ed by using them along with some diamonds in an [[anvil]]. They may also be repaired by crafting them together with another diamond helmet.

=== Enchantments ===
A helmet can receive the following [[enchantment]]s.

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a diamond helmet, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
