'''Lucky's Minigame Mayhem''' is a [[Marketplace]] map developed by YouTuber [[Logdotzip]], based around a variety of minigames.

== Summary ==
The map begins with the player in an airplane, with a squirrel character ordering to jump out. Once the player {{Control|jump|text=jumps}}, the player [[slow falling|descends]] using a parasol, as the title card appears. Descending down a hole in a building through a flight of [[stairs]], the player will eventually land and meet Lucky, the owner of the theme park the map is set on. Lucky explains the situation; in order to invite guests over to the park, they will need to activate a teleporter in the center of the room, and in order to do that, the player will need to retrieve the power source, trophies, from five attractions.

Once the player is finished speaking with Lucky, a series of doors open, revealing the paths to the five areas of the map. The player is then free to explore all of them in any order, however there are several optional features and details in the hub. Outside the lime door is a poster containing the map's credits, and to the right of that another explaining that the map uses "awesome stream-safe music." Progressing from there will reveal the first golden mob, a [[chicken]], a collectible found throughout the map. 

Further still is the Pet-O-Matic, a prize machine which rewards pets using tickets earned from the minigames. Beside the machine are a set of [[Wooden Trapdoor|tab]][[End Rod|les]], holding a pair of roller skates, which can be used to increase the player's speed. Past those is a sign linking to Logdotzip's support website, featuring a cameo from his traditional avatar.

=== Dragons ===
The section can be identified by a build of a large, red dragon breathing fire. In the hub, it sits between a [[birch]] surrounded by [[Tulip|tulips]] and a [[Stone Bricks|stone brick]] [[flower]] bed with [[Peony|peonies]] and [[Blue Orchid|blue orchids]], beside several scooters. Descending down a [[Block of Resin|resin]]-like path, players can pass by orange tulips, and walk into a small [[Mud Bricks|mud brick]] patio with a [[Leaves|hedge]] gate and umbrella table. To the right of the patio is another [[Packed Mud|packed mud]] path, leading into a large house with an open first floor, containing scarce filled only by a set of [[Barrel|barrels]], [[Cobweb|cobwebs]], and [[Polished Andesite|polished andesite]] flooring. However, a golden [[spider]] can be found underneath the stairs.. Up a flight of stairs is an atmospheric second floor, with a [[Planks|wooden]] floor, [[Carpet|orange carpets]], [[Scaffolding|tables]], [[Beehive|boxes]], [[Candle|candles]], and a [[bed]].

Returning to the orange path, more and more tulips will build up, until the player ends up at the site of the dragon's fire. There, the player can meet Coach Brimstone, a sports coach who is also a dragon. To his left is the entrance to the Target Practice minigame, in front of another large house, made up of three buildings very close together. In the yard are several rocks of [[clay]] and [[andesite]], amongst tall [[Tree|trees]]. Inside the central building is what looks like a cellar or workshop, with an empty [[Loom|bookshelf]], more boxes [[Composter|potted]] plants. A door beside the stairs lead to a [[Skeleton Skull|skull]] on a [[Bone Block|bone block]], while the stairs lead to an open bedroom with a [[cake]].

The leftmost building is similar, with more [[Bookshelf|bookshelves]] and [[Lectern|lecterns]] immediately visible. The second floor is again a bedroom, but in a circular shape with several bookshelves, plants, and storage units. The rightmost building has a much denser interior, with [[Flower Pot|potted]] [[Crimson Roots|crimson roots]] and [[crimson fungus]] on the first and second floors respectively. To the right of Brimstone is another small neighborhood, with the Ring Glider minigame behind a rock. The building closest to the minigame opens to a large space, with three skulls on [[Soul Sand|soul sand]] built into a beam, seemingly evoking the [[Wither]]. Next to it are two buildings with very similar layouts and details to the others, just with other items potted, such as [[Mushroom|brown mushroom]], and [[Lily of the Valley|lily of the valley]], and [[Warped Roots|warped roots]].

Heading straight from Brimstone leads the player under the dragon's fire, and finally to a large, [[Smooth Quartz Block|smooth quartz]] castle structure. The road forks into three paths, two circling the castle and leading to a Pet-O-Matic before returning to the start. The right path takes the player into the castle, with [[Concrete Powder|white concrete powder]] walls and an [[Diorite Wall|diorite]] chandelier. Climbing up the stairs will lead to an area decorated with [[Azure Bluet|azure bluets]], with two small bedrooms on the right side. On the left, there are two nonfunctional [[Stripped Log|do]][[Tripwire Hook|ors]], two more can be found on the third floor, reached from the right. Now on a wall, the player can walk underneath the dragon itself, made out of [[Red Nether Bricks|red nether bricks]]. Crossing the wall will reveal the third minigame, Sky Battle, with the golden endermite at the end in a final bedroom.

==== Target Practice ====
The minigame begins in a lobby, based inside a cramped recreation of a forest with a large [[mangrove]] house and several scarecrows, similar to those found at [[Pillager Outpost|pillager outposts]]. To begin the minigame players will have to speak to Coach Brimstone, who explains the goal. Players will ride on top of a large dragon, and can {{Control|use|text=shoot}} projectiles at targets, with the goal of earning 50 points in three minutes. Wooden targets reward 1 point, golden targets reward 3, diamond targets 5, and X targets lose 1 point. Once 50 points are earned or the time runs out, the minigame will end.

==== Ring Glider ====
{{Expand section}}
The minigame begins in a lobby, based on a series of [[Cloud|clouds]] made of [[Snow Block|snow]] and [[wool]]. To begin the minigame players will have to speak to Coach Brimstone, who explains the goal. Players will ride on top of a large dragon and have the objective of finding and going through 15 golden rings in 5 minutes. Once the 5 minutes are up or the player flew through all the rings, the game will end.

{{Quote|Hello there! Welcome to our little land of dreams. Seems you've made it here safely. As you know, it is nearly the new year and this old device in the center needs to be activated so players from far and wide can join the celebration. For this, we need you to gather the trophies from our 5 main attractions!

Outside, you'll find these attractions around this central building: Dragons, Weapons, Furniture, Mob Morphing and TNT! Each of these has three events that need to be completed to fire up this old device. So you, my friend, much locate the teleporters out there and travel to these challenges to win the trophies!

But you are not alone. No no no. My fellow hosts are waiting for you to complete their  events. Once you do, trophies will be awarded and the device will become... awakened! So, to recap: 5 attractions, 3 events each, find the teleporters! Daunting? Not for you. Are you ready to open the doors?|Lucky}}
