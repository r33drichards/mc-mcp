== Trivia ==
* "fourj" refers to [[4J Studios]], the game development studio of [[Legacy Console Edition]].
* The numerical ID of the item seems to align with what the [[debug stick]] would have likely been assigned had it been introduced prior to [[The Flattening]]. 4J Studios assigned numerical IDs to all future items added as the flattening never happened for [[Legacy Console Edition]].
