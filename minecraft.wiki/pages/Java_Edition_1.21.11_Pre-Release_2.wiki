A separate [[unobfuscated version]] of 1.21.11 Pre-Release 2 was released, titled '''1.21.11 Pre-Release 2 Unobfuscated''' (or '''1.21.11-pre2_unobfuscated''' when in the launcher). This is an experimental version released in preparation for obfuscation being removed from {{JE}} clients and servers.<ref>{{Mcnet|removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition|Removing obfuscation in Java Edition|October 29, 2025}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Leaves]]'''
* {{Animate|Oak Leaves (fast) JE7.png; Spruce Leaves (fast) JE6.png; Birch Leaves (fast) JE6.png; Jungle Leaves (fast) JE5.png; Acacia Leaves (fast) JE3.png; Dark Oak Leaves (fast) JE3.png; Mangrove Leaves (fast) JE4.png; Cherry Leaves (fast) JE4.png; Pale Oak Leaves (fast) JE3.png; Azalea Leaves (fast) JE3.png; Flowering Azalea Leaves (fast) JE3.png|32px}} The gaps between leaves are now dark green instead of black when "See-Through Leaves" video setting is disabled.

=== General ===
'''[[Graphics]]'''
* Disabling the "See-Through Leaves" video setting now improves performance more than before because leaves occluded faces are now culled.
