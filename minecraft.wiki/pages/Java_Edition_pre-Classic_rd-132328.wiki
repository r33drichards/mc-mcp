'''rd-132328''' is a [[pre-Classic]] version made on May 13, 2009, at 21:28 UTC, which added mobs.<ref>{{link|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140911065542/s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/rd-132328/rd-132328.json|title=rd-132328.json|date=May 13, 2009}}</ref>

The copy in the [[launcher]] was last modified on August 6, 2013, making it technically not original.

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Steve_JE1.png|40px]] [[File:Old human mob walking animation.gif|40px]] [[Mob (entity)|Mob]]s<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210507203659/notch.tumblr.com/post/107611170/exhausted-but-happy|title=Exhausted, but happy|website=The Word of Notch|date=May 14, 2009}}</ref>'''
* Run randomly around the map, flailing their arms with no proper AI or movement animation.
* The first [[mob]] to be added into the game.
* 100 spawn at random positions upon world generation and loading.
* Does not save into the {{cd|level.dat}} file.
** Once the world is closed and reopened, all mobs previously there would have [[despawn]]ed and new ones would spawn in.
* Reused from ''[[Zombie Town]]'', an abandoned project made by Notch before ''Minecraft''.
* Are referred to as [[zombie]]s in the code.
* Their texture is now known as [[Steve]]

=== General ===
'''[[World spawn]]'''
* The player is supposed to slowly rise up to the ground level if they spawn under the world. However, it is impossible to spawn under the world without modding, hence why it is unused.{{more info|Was this added in this version? maybe}}

== Trivia ==
* The "rd" before the version number stands for [[RubyDung]], a game Notch was working on before ''Minecraft'', whose codebase was later reused for ''Minecraft''.
* The oldest publicly known ''Minecraft'' world level is for this version.<ref>{{ytl|hdCO4ZZghbo}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20230731180114/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/361636558568423435/1085264531783176322/level.dat level.dat] download</ref>
* This version marks the first appearance of [[Steve]] in ''Minecraft''.
* While the intended level size is 256x64x256, a world of any size can be loaded. Worlds that are too small will have generation put ontop of them, and worlds that are too large will fill the entire world and then get cut off.
* Grass blocks are stored using the same block ID as cobblestone, the difference between them is purely visual.
* Despite normally only using 2 block IDs (0 and 1), 0-255 are all possible IDs. Invalid IDs appear as air, but do not get converted into it.
* Because of all of the above, theoretically any [[w:gzip|gzipped file]] called {{cd|level.dat}} can be loaded as a world without issue, including a [[Java_Edition_level_format#level.dat_format|modern level.dat]]. Note this will likely corrupt the file upon saving. This is due to the extra generation when the world is undersized, or the trimming applied when it's oversized, or simply any blocks placed/broken.
