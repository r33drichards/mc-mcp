'''''Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition''''' is the {{el|lce}} version of ''Minecraft'' developed by [[4J Studios]] and [[Mojang Studios]] for the {{w|PlayStation 4}}.<ref>[[4J Studios]], [{{tweet|4JStudios|370111405216649216}} "Happy to confirm we're developing Minecraft PS3, PS4 & PS Vita Editions for Mojang, as well as Xbox 360 & Xbox One Editions!"], ''Twitter'', 2013-08-21.</ref> It was announced on August 20, 2013 at Sony Interactive Entertainment's exhibit at {{w|Gamescom}} 2013 and was available for purchase on the PlayStation Store for $19.99 between September 4, 2014 and December 10, 2019.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|369887393253699584|Minecraft was just announced for Playstation 3 & 4!…"|August 20, 2013}}</ref> Existing digital owners are still able to access, re-download, and play this version. A retail version was released on October 3, 2014 and can still be purchased. DLC for the game is still available on the PlayStation Store. Like the [[Xbox One Edition|''Xbox One'']] and [[Nintendo Switch Edition|''Nintendo Switch'']] Editions players, the ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' owners have the option to download the [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']] version for free, however not all DLC will transfer. As with many games that are released on the PlayStation 4, ''Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition'' can be played on the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV through Remote Play. 

Compared to the ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', the ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' features [[world]] sizes up to 5120×5120 blocks (36 times larger), native 1080p resolution, up to 18 [[chunk|chunks]] [[render distance]], [[AMPLIFIED|amplified]] worlds, 16 player multiplayer and Large+ Battle Maps for [[mini games]], and the option to constantly save the world in the background and the abilty to only show craftable recipes in the crafting interface akin to the ''[[Java Edition|Java]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition|Bedrock]]'' Editions. The ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' is playable on the {{w|PlayStation 5}} via backward compatibility. 

As of [[PlayStation 4 Edition 1.95|1.95]], the ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' has not received new feature updates since [[Village & Pillage]], as the edition was discontinued when ''Bedrock Edition'' launched on PlayStation 4 with the [[Buzzy Bees]] update. 

== Controls ==
{{main|Controls#Legacy Console Edition}}
In default settings, the [[controls]] are always displayed on the [[Heads-up display|HUD]]. The controls for ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' are similar to ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]''. However, the ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' also supports the capacitive touch-pad present on the [[wikipedia:DualShock 4|DualShock 4]] controller; the touch-pad can be used to navigate the menus and manage the [[inventory]].

== Gameplay ==
The game is similar to ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', but provides certain enhancements (e.g. render distance, performance, player count) due to the game taking advantage of the PlayStation 4's more powerful hardware. Players were able to transfer and expand upon worlds created on ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' and ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]''; however, this feature was removed on April 15, 2020 via an [[Bedrock Edition 1.14.60|update]].

== Trivia ==
* Presently, the ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' was the last [[Legacy Console Edition]] to receive updates, as the ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' was released on the platform on December 10, 2019.
* The ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' was the only Legacy Console Edition to receive the [[Texture Update]].
