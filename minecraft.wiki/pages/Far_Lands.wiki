The '''far lands'''<ref>{{tweet|notch|97216060708753408|/v/ is petitioning me to change the name from "Endermen" to "Farlanders". How about we just rename the "far lands" to "the end" instead? ;D|July 30, 2011|archive=|archiveid=}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://notch.tumblr.com/post/3746989361/terrain-generation-part-1|title=Terrain generation, Part 1|section=|website=[[The Word of Notch]]|author=[[Markus Persson]]|date=March 9, 2011|quote=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322154638/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/3746989361/terrain-generation-part-1}}</ref> were a terrain generation bug and a [[Java Edition hard limits|hard world boundary]] that appeared when the [[noise generator]]s responsible for creating the shape of terrain stopped functioning properly due to an {{w|integer overflow}}. This resulted in massive, spongy walls of terrain appearing around 12,550,821 blocks from the [[world spawn]]. They appeared as if they had been pulled and stretched apart, with layers of [[stone]], [[dirt]], and other [[block]]s forming bizarre and fragmented formations.

The insides of Far Lands were long dark tunnels, featuring sharp edges and extreme landscapes. [[Mob]]s might spawn in there, with [[monster]]s being the most common. The top and corners of the Far Lands are mostly flat, filled with [[tree]]s and occasionally [[village]]s. Reaching further at 1,004,065,811 blocks, the noise generators would break down again and produce even more stretched terrain, these often being called the "[[Java_Edition_Far_Lands/Infdev_20100327_to_Beta_1.7.3#Farther_Lands|Farther Lands]]".

The Far Lands were fixed later on [[Beta 1.8 Pre-release]], and an intentional [[world border]] was placed more than twice as far as the former hard boundary on [[Java Edition 1.8]], but they still retain a legacy as one of the franchise's most famous [[glitch]]es, even being referenced in other official games such as ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.

The Far Lands technically still exist in the game, however, they are far beyond the world border.{{Needs testing|How far might it be and what effects might be expected there?}}

== General information ==
=== What the Far Lands are not ===
{{:Far Lands/What the Far Lands are not}}

=== Types of Far Lands ===
The Far Lands comprise a very, very wide array of terrain generation bugs. The effects vary depending on which noise generator breaks (for traditional Far Lands, "low noise" and "high noise" are jointly responsible), as well as the player's distance on each axis (the "Edge Far Lands" refer to when noise breaks on only one axis, the "Corner Far Lands" on two, and the "Vertex Far Lands" on three).

Other noise generators are capable of breaking down. Selector noise, a noise generator which determines whether low noise or high noise is used at a given position in the world, breaks down 80 times further than low and high noise by default, giving rise to what is known as the "Farther Lands".

A full list of {{el|je}} noise generators known to break down and give rise to their own unique effects is as follows. Note that it assumes that the X and Z axes are identical, and ignores the Y axis; in many cases, the Y axis has a different value from the X and Z axes, whereas in other cases the noise generator is entirely 2D.

=== Walking to the Far Lands ===
Walking to the Far Lands is the time-consuming challenge involving a terrestrial journey 12.5M blocks out of spawn. The most common version used is b1.7.3 as this is the last version to contain the Far Lands and has the conveniences such as beds that some previous versions don't have.

Over 30 players have attempted the feat legitimately, with about 1/3 completing the journey, 1/3 currently walking (as of October 2023) and 1/3 having gone inactive (including one real life death, TinfoilChef). The first player to complete the journey (without using the [[Nether]] as a means of shortcut) was KilloCrazyMan between 2019-20. [[Notch]] awarded him $6,000 through two separate donations. The most famous is Far Lands or Bust with KurtJMac, through which he helped raise over $500,000 for various charities over the course of 14 years.<ref name=":0">[https://premiumminecraft.com/people-who-reached-the-far-lands-rewritten-updated-oct-2023/ <nowiki>The Far Lands Walkers 2 | COMPLETE LIST 2023 [30+ players] – Premium Minecraft Blog</nowiki>]</ref> KurtJMac completed his journey to the Far Lands on October 4th, 2025.

Time-wise, the walking (not sprinting) speed is 4.3 blocks per second. Walking for 6 hours per day is equal to 21,600 seconds, giving a travelled distance of 92,880 blocks every day. Walking to the 12.5M Far Lands would take just under 136 days at this pace.

Furthermore, two people, Xelanater, and qSav, have reached the Nether Far Lands legitimately.<ref name=":0" />

== Trivia ==
* In {{el|be}}, the Far Lands were first introduced with the infinite terrain generation in [[0.9.0 alpha]], and were removed in [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.30|1.17.30]] ([[Bedrock Edition beta 1.17.20.20|beta 1.17.20.20]]).
* The Far Lands are referenced as a [[splash]], which reads "One does not simply walk to the Far Lands".
