'''Invalid data value blocks of quartz''' are item forms of the [[block of quartz]] with damage values outside of the usual range which blocks of quartz can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value blocks of quartz are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Breaking rotated quartz pillars ===
Blocks of quartz with metadata 3 and 4 correspond to quartz pillars facing sideways directions. The ability to place blocks of quartz sideways was added in 13w03a, and was impossible in 13w02a, making these metadata values unused in said versions. If quartz pillars are placed sideways in 13w03a or a later version and the world is then loaded in 13w02a or 13w02b, the sideways quartz pillars (which will look like normal quartz blocks in these older versions) can be broken to obtain quartz block items with damage values 3 and 4.

=== Transmutation ===
[[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation#Door Transmutation|Block transmutation]] with doors can be used to obtain blocks of quartz with metadata 5 to 7, and with arrows can be used to obtain blocks with metadata 5 to 15. These blocks can be mined in 14w21b or earlier to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.

== Usage ==
From 13w02a to 14w21b, invalid data value blocks of quartz would place the block that corresponds to the item form. Unlike invalid data value logs, this includes the two data values that correspond to rotated pillars, meaning that one of these two items will always place a sideways quartz pillar regardless of the player's facing direction or the targeted block face.

From 14w25a to 17w46a, invalid data value blocks of quartz will always place a normal block of quartz, including those that previously had the data of rotated pillars.

=== Conversion to future versions ===

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.5|dev=13w02a|Blocks of quartz have been added. Invalid data variants exist as a consequence of how item metadata is handled.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w03a|Quartz pillars can now be placed sideways, allowing for two more block metadata variants to be accessed in normal gameplay, but rendering the item forms unobtainable via mining alone. However, they can be obtained by downgrading a world to 13w02a or 13w02b.
|This also changes the appearance of the two item forms.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w10a|The item forms of all invalid data value quartz blocks have changed; the two corresponding to rotated pillars now map textures correctly but the lighting behaves rotated as well, and the remaining unused variants now are 2D in item form.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w25a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE1.png|32px}} With the introduction of data-driven item models, any item with a data value outside of what is accepted by the game has no model to point to, resulting in use of the missing item model.
|Invalid data value quartz block items now place the normal block of quartz, rather than the block with a metadata value corresponding to the item's damage.
|Placed blocks of quartz with metadata 5 to 15 now drop the normal block of quartz as an item, rather than the item corresponding to their metadata value.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w30a|Invalid data value blocks of quartz, alongside other invalid data value items, now appear the size of a full block when held in third person or by another player or mob.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w31a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE2.png|32px}} The missing model's inventory appearance has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value blocks of quartz also changing.
|The items also appear the size of a full block when held in first person and when dropped on the ground, and also appear larger than before in an [[item frame]].}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w43a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE3.png|32px}} The missing texture has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value blocks of quartz also changing.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=17w47a|Numeric IDs for blocks and items have been completely removed from the game. As a result, invalid data value blocks of quartz have been "removed" as they now convert into normal block of quartz items.}}

; Placed form
As invalid data blocks were effectively deleted in 1.8, considerably before invalid data value items, the block form is documented in the section below.

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w25a|Invalid data value blocks of quartz placed in the world now use missing texture particles, rather than the particles of the block of quartz.
|Like with other blocks that use the missing model, invalid data value blocks of quartz now display the cracking animation correctly.}}

== Issues ==
Invalid data value blocks of quartz ''are'' an issue, and due to their removal, can be considered already fixed.
