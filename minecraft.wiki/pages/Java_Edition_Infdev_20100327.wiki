A version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''March 27, 2010'''.<ref>[[wordofnotch:477553920|"Infdev's been updated with saving and new terrain"]] – [[The Word of Notch]], March 27, 2010</ref>

With its introduction of the [[Alpha level format]] and the reintroduction of level saving, this is the first version where worlds created in it can be opened in any subsequent version (except for snapshots [[21w06a]] through [[21w14a]] for [[Java Edition 1.17|release 1.17]] and [[21w37a]] through [[21w38a]] for [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]], which was due to a lack of a system to convert worlds rather than being fundamentally incompatible) without the need for external editors.

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* The world generation is now responsible of new [[noise generator]]s that replace the Classic world noise generator. These are: "Low Noise", "High Noise", and "Selector Noise". The first two are responsible of generating the [[Far Lands]].

=== General ===
'''General'''
* The game now automatically saves while playing.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Furnace (S) JE1.png; Lit Furnace (S) JE1.png|32px}} [[Furnace]]'''
* The smelting time of furnaces has been reduced from 8 seconds to 4 seconds.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[File:Steve JE3 BE1.png|32px]] [[Player]]s'''
* The [[player]] dying causes the contents of their [[inventory]] to drop, and respawns the player at the world spawn, rather than forcing the player to reload the last save.
* Now not start with [[item]]s in new worlds.
* The player always spawns at 0,64,0, then gets shot up to the nearest available space.

=== General ===
* The level format has been updated from the [[Indev level format]] to the [[Alpha level format]].
* The world saving interface has been revamped.
** The "Generate new level..." button has been replaced with a "Single player" button which opens the [[Select world]] screen, in which worlds can be loaded, created, and deleted. The "Load level.." button has been replaced with a "Multi player" button, although it is always grayed out.
** The Select world screen displays the file size of the world, based on the {{nbt|long|SizeOnDisk}} value in [[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]]. This value is calculated inaccurately, usually underestimating the world size by a large margin.

== Technical ==
'''Performance'''
* Performance improvements.

== Removals ==
=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* The Classic world noise terrain generator has been removed of the game's code, revamping the terrain generation.
* [[Cave]]s and [[flower]]s no longer generate, as they are not yet implemented in the new terrain generator.

'''[[File:Brick Pyramid.png|40px]] [[Brick Pyramid]]'''
* [[Brick pyramid]]s removed.

=== General ===
'''General'''
* The defunct [[map theme]], [[map shape]], and [[map type]] buttons have been removed from the interface.
* Debug [[tool]]s are removed from the player's [[inventory]].

== Fixes ==
'''1 bug fixed'''
* The game's performance no longer drastically degrades progressively.</onlyinclude>

== Bugs ==
'''14 bugs reported'''
* The [[Far Lands]] are not an addition itself. Instead, they are the overflow of the new Low and High [[noise generator]]s, that overflow at 12,550,824 blocks away on the X and Z axes, where the Far Lands generate.
* Naturally-generated places that do not have direct exposure to the sky (e.g. cliff overhangs) are completely dark until given a sky light update.
** Note that block updates on their own have no effect.
* The world above the height limit is always fully lit and can cause blocks near the height limit to be lit up at nighttime with block light if a block update happens. This can temporarily hang the game while it processes the insane amounts of lighting updates, and may crash on older computers.
* After dying, the player's body remains lying where they died.
** The body can be pushed around and still has the idle animation, as if it were still alive.
** Standing on the body causes it to disappear. When the player moves away, it reappears.
** Jumping onto the body can cause the player to slide on it briefly. This works best when the body is in a tight space, such as a 1-block-deep, 3-block-long hole.
** When blocks are placed on the body, completely covering it, the body becomes black — but this isn't visible until one of the blocks is removed. Once all blocks are removed, the body returns to its normal red color.
* After loading an existing world, ores and trees regenerate if the conditions are correct (e.g. the place where ore would generate is filled with [[stone]]).
** Ore regenerates if it is replaced with stone.
** Trees regenerate if the block underneath is dirt or grass, and the tree has enough space to grow
** Interestingly, this phenomenon occurs even under unnatural conditions: creating a large, flat, dirt platform in the sky will cause trees to generate on it. 
* [[Wheat]] crops, fire, farmland, torches and saplings preserve their data values in the occupied space, resulting in newly-placed blocks to take on the data value of the block previously occupying that space allowing for any block from this version to obtain a damage value between 0-15 (Though the item form has to be obtained with silk touch in a later version.).
* Containers (i.e. [[chest]]s and [[furnace]]s) do not save if the chunk is not updated since. 
** They require a chunk update in their chunk to update.
* When generating a new world, the game may stop responding on some laptops.
* [[Slab]]s have broken lighting.
* Pressing the respawn button multiple times creates clones of the player, and when the player touches/attacks any clone, the player's hand goes crazy. (this is the only known way to spawn the [[Mob (entity)|Mob]] in this era of the game without modding).
* After reloging onto a world the player is raised by 1 block up.
* Opening a furnace that has no item in its fuel slot while its smelting crashes the game.
* Furnace smelting time can sometimes be cut in half, or doubled, after saving and exiting.{{Info needed}}
* On very rare occasions taking items out of a furnace output slot crashes the game.{{Info needed}}
