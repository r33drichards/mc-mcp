{{relevant guide|Bedrock Edition guides/0.12 releases}}<onlyinclude>

'''v0.12.1 alpha''' is a major update to {{PE}} and a minor update to the {{el|Windows 10}} Beta that was released over the timeframe of September 4–9, 2015. For ''Pocket Edition'', it adds many new things such as [[the Nether]], [[brewing]], [[enchanting]], [[hunger]], [[weather]], and many more additions which helped to bring it closer to {{JE}}, as well other changes and fixes.

The release was initially intended to coincide with [[Windows 10 Edition Beta v0.12.0|the release]] of ''Windows 10 Edition'' on July 29, 2015, when it was announced at [[MINECON 2015]]. However, it was delayed due to obstacles in its development in the days leading up to its intended release date, making this the first version of 0.12 for Pocket Edition.<ref name=Delay>{{tweet|_tomcc|623056316274221056|So, we actually wanted to release MCPE on the 29th, but it would have no Enchanting, Music and Controller support... so August, hopefully :)|20 Jul 2015}}</ref>
