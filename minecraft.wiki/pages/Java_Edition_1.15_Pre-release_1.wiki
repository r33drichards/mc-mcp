== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dark prismarine]]'''
* Now crafted from [[black dye]] instead of [[ink sac]]s.

'''[[Scaffolding]]'''
* Increased scaffolding burn time when used as [[fuel]] in a [[furnace]] to be able to smelt 2 [[item]]s, rather than 0.25.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[Zombie pigmen]] spawn eggs can now be {{control|used}} on adult zombie pigmen to spawn baby variants.

=== General ===
'''Performance'''
* Optimized [[chunk]] rendering.
* Optimized [[explosion]]s.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* The resource pack version is now 5 (due to texture mechanic changes in earlier snapshots).
* The game now tries to make out of date resource packs work as much as possible.{{more info|How?}}
** The game can convert some of version 4 resource packs' outdated texture mechanics to the new mechanics.

'''UI'''
* Changed appearance of highlighted buttons used in [[options]] screen and similar UIs.
** Highlighted buttons now have a white outline.
** Highlighted buttons no longer have a blue tint on them. Instead, they are now only slightly brighter than unhighlighted buttons.
