'''General'''
* Command blocks no longer censor numbers ({{bug|MCPE-106296}}).
* Fixed inability to resume mining with touch controls after being interrupted ({{bug|MCPE-115507}}).
* Fixed an issue where crafting a bed with the recipe book unlocked the "Change of Sheets" trophy.

* Fixed Skin Preview navigation when using a controller.
* Fixed arrows getting stuck in the air after hitting a player with high latency.
