'''Potatofication''' is a joke [[enchantment]] added in [[24w14potato]].

== Usage ==
A tool enchanted with Potatofication causes blocks mined by it to drop either regular [[potato]]es or [[poisonous potato]]es. Block must be mineable by that tool to drop potatoes, for example, mining [[potone]] with a pickaxe enchanted with Potatofication doesn't drop anything, but a hoe enchanted with Potatofication does drop both the block and potatoes. 

The number of potatoes dropped is calculated in the following way:
*Split the <math>level</math> into two non-negative integers <math>n</math> and <math>m</math>.
**For Potatofication I, only valid splits are 1+0 and 0+1. For Potatofication V, valid splits include 5+0, 4+1, 3+2, 2+3, 1+4 and 0+5.
*Drop <math>n^2</math> poisonous potatoes and <math>m^2</math> regular potatoes.

A [[poisonous potato plant]] is added to the drops 5% of the time.
