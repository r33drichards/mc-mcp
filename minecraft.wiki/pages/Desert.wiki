{{relevant tutorial|Survival in an infinite desert}}

A '''desert''' is an expansive arid [[biome]] mainly consisting of [[sand]].
<!-- Biome with the most unique generated structure can generate in, being 5.-->

== Description ==
The surface is made entirely of [[sand]], with [[sandstone]] generating underneath the sand. The terrain is usually flat, but with occasional hills.

Desert biomes are quite barren. Among the animals that can spawn in the desert, only [[rabbit]]s and [[camel]]s spawn in the wild, while [[villager]]s, [[cat]]s, [[cow]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s and [[camel]]s appear in desert [[village]]s. [[Cactus]] and [[dead bush]]es generate frequently across the landscape, with cacti sometimes featuring a [[Cactus Flower|cactus flower]] on top of them. [[Sugar cane]]s may generate along water. [[Lava]] ponds may still generate; water may still generate if the altitude dips low enough. Deserts make up for their barrenness by featuring a relatively large number of structures, such as pillager outposts, villages, [[desert pyramid]]s, [[fossil]]s, and [[desert well]]s. Villages and desert pyramids may offer refuge and valuable loot, desert wells may serve as a rare source of water, and fossils can provide large numbers of [[bone block]]s and [[bone meal]], or simply a neat paleontological find, while [[pillager outpost]]s are the only source of wood on the desert surface. Deserts are uncommon, making up around 3% of the Overworld by area, and they are as uncommon as [[snowy plains]].

Despite the structures, survival in deserts can still be difficult if one does not bring sufficient resources, as the desert has virtually no resources of its own. Wood [[log]]s can be obtained only from [[pillager outpost]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, or [[azalea tree]]s if there's a lush cave underground, though [[dead bush]]es provide a source of [[stick]]s. Tree saplings can be obtained by trading with a [[wandering trader]]. The only desert water sources are [[village]]s, [[desert well]]s, [[river]]s, and aquifers. At night or thunderstorms, most [[zombie]]s and [[zombie villager]]s that spawn in deserts are replaced by [[husk]]s, variants of zombies that inflict the [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] effect, while most [[skeleton]]s are replaced by [[parched]], variants of skeleton that shoot [[arrows of weakness]], and uncommonly, these two can spawn riding [[camel husk]]s, undead variants of camels. These three [[monster]]s do not burn in the sun, resulting in more hostile mobs present during daytime.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], deserts have unique atmospherics, lighting, and color grading which appear very dry and yellow, although they use default volumetric [[fog]].

Deserts generate in areas with very high temperatures and are more likely to generate in areas with high [[Biome#Erosion|erosion]] values. They can generate in lower erosions, but usually as a separation between a badlands biome and the oceans. Somewhat contrary to intuition, deserts can generate at any humidity value.

Deserts are often found bordering [[badlands]] (all variants) or [[mangrove swamp]]s. Other biomes they can border include [[jungle]]s (all variants), [[savanna]]s, [[windswept savanna]]s, [[plains]] and [[forest]]s (regular variant only).

In coastal areas, deserts border [[warm ocean]]s. Unlike most biomes, they do not generate [[beach]] biomes along the coastline, though [[stony shore]]s do generate if erosion is low.

At high humidity values, [[lush caves]] can sometimes generate underneath deserts, making deserts the only non-forested biomes where lush caves can generate. Because deserts have a high erosion value, the [[deep dark]] cannot generate underneath them.
