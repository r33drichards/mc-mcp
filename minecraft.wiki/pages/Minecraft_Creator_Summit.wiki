'''Minecraft Creator Summits''' were annual events hosted by [[Mojang Studios]] to bring together ''Minecraft'' content creators. These summits were held in Stockholm and lasted up to three days. They included activities such as games, dinners, and parties at Mojang Studios' offices, as well as conferences. Minecraft Creator Summits served as a platform for content creators to engage directly with Mojang employees and gain exclusive insights of upcoming content. They took place from 2017 to 2019.

Starting in 2021, they were replaced by '''Minecraft Virtual Creator Summits'''<ref>{{tweet|docm77|1395242772937035777|The past two days was virtual Minecraft Creator Summit.

=== Mojang employee statements ===
* [[Jeb]] announced that [[Java Edition 1.13]] would be mainly technical.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017">{{ytl|TokB4WmdYtQ|Infos 1.13 et autres - Visite chez Mojang|Aurelien_Sama|August 24, 2017}}</ref>
** The way maps are saved would be improved.
** The limitations caused by the way [[Java Edition data values/Pre-flattening|ID]]s work would be addressed (teasing [[the Flattening]]).
*** It was stated that the only reason keeping Mojang from adding more [[stair]]s and [[slab]]s was the ID system.
* It was announced that combat would be revamped again.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
** However, there are no plans to go back to the pre-[[Combat Update]] system.
* It was stated that there could eventually be a GUI update in both {{el|be}} and {{el|je}}.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
* [[Vu Bui]] gave a presentation on the [[MINECON]]'s history and explained why it would be replaced by [[MINECON Earth]].<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
** He confirmed that there would be official stream parties around the world.
* Vu Bui stated that [[structure]]s are not meant to be the prettiest so that players can improve them or build their own structures.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
* [[ProfMobius]] announced that the world generation and structure generation would eventually be revamped.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
** It was stated that this would only be a technical change and that the terrain won't be affected.
** The world generation would be more efficient and more customizable.
** It was stated that ProfMobius would focus on improving the world generation and that these changes are not aimed for any update.
* [[Jappa]] stated that the new textures are not aimed to be part of the [[Update Aquatic]] but will release when they will be done.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
* Vu Bui stated that Microsoft does not exert creative control over ''Minecraft'' but do give advice and guidance.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
* It was confirmed that the differences in how [[redstone]] functions between {{el|be}} and {{el|je}} were intentional.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
* It was confirmed that the official modding API would be exclusive to {{el|be}} and that no modding API is planned for {{el|je}} as third-party modding APIs are good enough.<ref name="aurelien_sama 2017" />
