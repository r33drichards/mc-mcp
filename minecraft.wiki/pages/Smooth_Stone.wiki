'''Smooth stone''' is a variant of [[stone]] made by [[smelting]] regular stone.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Smooth stone requires a [[pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

{{breaking row|Smooth Stone|Pickaxe|Wood|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Smooth stone generates inside some houses in [[plains]], [[savanna]], and [[snowy plains]] [[village]]s in the butcher's house in the form of slabs and blocks.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|smooth-stone}}

=== Data history ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w04a|Double slab blocks have been intentionally changed such that double slabs with metadata 8-15 look identical to those with 0-7, except that they use the top texture on all sides instead. As a result, smooth stone has been reintroduced to the game with metadata value 8.}}
