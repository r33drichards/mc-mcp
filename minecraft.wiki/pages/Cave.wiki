A '''cave''' (also known as a '''cavern''') is a common [[terrain feature]] that generates in the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]]. Caves are usually found underground. They are open spaces of various sizes and shapes that often intersect with each other or with different [[generated structures]], creating vast cave systems. They feature an abundance of [[ore]]s, as well as hostile mobs that spawn in the [[Light|darkness]].

== Generation ==
{{main|World generation#Noise caves|World generation#Carvers}}

Caves are a part of Minecraft's terrain consisting of randomly generated cavities of [[air]], [[water]] or [[lava]], creating a hollow area and exposing other blocks generated with the terrain (such as [[stone]]s and [[Ore (feature)|ores]]).

Caves generate at any [[altitude]] up to Y-level 256, and may span from the surface all the way to Y-level -59. Because of low [[light]] levels, hostile [[mob]]s and certain animals like [[bat]]s and [[glow squid]]s (only in water) often spawn in caves.

Caves come in two distinct types; noise caves and carver caves. Noise caves are generated along with the base terrain, while carver caves are added later on as generated features.

== Noise caves ==
[[File:Noise cave mechanism.jpg|thumb|The mechanics of noise cave generation explained by former Mojang dev [[Henrik Kniberg]].<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1364265702861987841|I get a lot of questions about how the new Minecraft noise caves work, and why we call them silly things like Cheese caves and Spaghetti caves. Here's an attempt to summarize it in a picture, hope it makes some kind of sense :)}}</ref>]]
Noise caves are generated using a noise. They come in the form of cheese caves, spaghetti caves, and noodle caves.<ref name="21w06a">{{snap|21w06a|February 10, 2021}}</ref> By adjusting noise frequency, hollowness (for cheese caves), and thickness (for spaghetti caves, noodle caves, and noise pillars), noise caves can vary in extremely diverse ways. When generating noise caves, the game firstly generates a random noise field, and "smudges" it using a mathematical trick called [[wikipedia:Perlin noise|Perlin noise]]. These processes then result in a 3D noise image. Noise pillars also generate inside cave blobs.

Noise caves are a part of the base terrain generation, and so do not intersect generated structures or mineral deposits. They are typically decorated with biome-specific features and decoration such as grass, sand, snow, or trees at higher y-levels, or dripstone pillars or clay deltas at lower y-levels. This is important, as cave noise is dually used to generate important Overworld terrain features such as overhangs or floating islands on the surface.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob3VwY4JyzE</ref>

=== Cheese cave ===
{{distinguish|Cheese}}
[[File:Cheese Cave.png|thumb|Inside of a [https://minecraft.wiki/w/File:Noise%20cave%20mechanism.jpg high-hollowness low-frequency] cheese cave.]]

Cheese caves are pocket areas of the underground that come in various sizes. Cheese caves offer large and open spaces, being the largest cave type in the game. They frequently generate noise pillars and expose many [[ore]]s. When generating, the black part of noise image becomes stone or deepslate, and white part becomes air, making it resemble cheese with many holes.
{{-}}


=== Spaghetti cave ===
[[File:Spaghetti Cave.png|thumb|right|Inside of a spaghetti cave.]]
[[File:Spaghetti cave X-ray.png|thumb|right|Spaghetti cave in Spectator mode.]]

Spaghetti caves are long, narrow, winding caves and are a bit similar to small or medium carver caves, but longer. When generating, the edge of black and white part of noise image becomes air, making it look like long and wide spaghetti.
{{-}}

=== Noodle cave ===
[[File:Noodle Cave.png|thumb|right|Inside of a noodle cave.]]
[[File:Snapshot-21w17a-noodle-caves-full.jpg|thumb|right|Noodle caves in Spectator mode.]]

Noodle caves are a thinner and squigglier variant of spaghetti caves. They consist of tunnels usually 1 to 5 blocks in width. When generating, the edge of black and white part of noise image becomes air, making it look like long and thin noodles.
{{-}}

=== Noise pillar ===
[[File:Stone cave pillars.png|thumb|right|Pillars in a cheese cave.]]
[[File:Deepslate speleothems.png|thumb|right|Another cave with pillars.]]

Noise pillars look like [[Dripstone (feature)|large dripstones]] or speleothems, but consist usually of stone. They can be found in any type of noise cave, making caves more realistic.
{{-}}

=== Aquifer ===
[[File:A lava lake.png|right|thumb|Example of two underground liquid bodies and a lava lake.]]
[[File:Aquifers of different levels.jpg|thumb|Example of two water bodies of differing levels.]]
[[File:Lava Aquifer.jpg|thumb|Example of two large lava bodies.]]

Aquifers are liquid systems used to generate bodies of liquids in a world. Almost all liquids in a world (including those in carvers, noise caves, rivers, and oceans) are generated by aquifers. Aquifers may create underground liquid bodies that look like lakes, as well as water or lava waterfalls. Note that [[lava lake]]s are also generated underground, but are not aquifers.

Aquifers below Y=0 may sometimes generate with [[lava]] instead of water, with aquifers from y=-55 to -63 always consisting of lava.

If two liquid bodies of different levels or types are too close, some blocks may be generated between them to separate them.  These may resemble "rimstone dams" in caves.
{{-}}

== Carver caves ==
{{redirect|Carver|carver canyons|Canyon|how carvers are generated|World generation#Carvers|the definition of carvers in data packs|Carver definition}}

Carver caves' structure typically consists of a series of irregular tunnels branching off and winding in other directions, which may cut through to the surface, creating natural entrances to the cave.

A carver cave may have a main room (aka '''circular void''') connecting 1 to 4 trunks, each trunk with zero or two branches. It may also have no main room, only one trunk and zero or two branches on it, that is, an I-shaped or T-shaped cave. There is a one-in-four probability of generating a cave with the main room, and another three-quarters probability of generating an I-shaped or T-shaped cave.

The main room is an ellipsoidal void of various size. It sometimes may be too small to be found, making the cave looks I-shaped or T-shaped. But as long as the cave is not I-shaped or T-shaped, it must have a main room. 

For each trunk or branch, it is usually thin at both ends and thick in the middle. However, the thickness does not vary so evenly. It sometimes flickers thick and thin as it advances. Sometimes it becomes so thin that there are some interruptions. Multiple interruptions make it look like a series of continuous bubbles. The length from the root of the trunk to the top of a branch varies from 85 to 112 blocks.
<!--
int temp=(4 * 2 - 1) * 16;    //112
int length = temp - randomSource.nextInt(temp / 4);    //[85,112)
-->
The trunk and branches are curved, and they are often intertwined with each other to make complex caves. Multiple caves sometimes merge with each other making them more messy and spacious.

The ceiling of the main room, trunks, and branches is usually round, while the floor is usually flat.

In contrast with noise caves' gradual and natural openings, carver caves frequently cut straight through surface blocks and generated features, either destroying them or inhibiting their generation. [[Sand]] often falls into caves generated near the surface of a [[desert]] or [[beach]]; craters in the sand can alert the player to caves below the surface. Caves cannot cut through [[red sand]] nor [[snow block]]s, despite these generating as a surface block in several biomes.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|16132|Cave carvers don't cut through snow blocks|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref> They frequently intersect and expose other natural structures such as other caves, [[monster room]]s, carver [[canyon]]s, and [[mineshaft]]s.

===Overworld carver cave===
The carver cave generation in the Overworld starts from Y=-56 to Y=180. The probability of cave generation is higher at Y=-56 to Y=47.
<!--minecraft:cave and minecraft:cave_extra_underground-->

Their main rooms vary from roughly 1 to 14 blocks in height, and from roughly 5 to 15 blocks in diameter.
<!--

double horizonThickness = horizonRadius * 2;
double verticalThickness = verticalRadius * (1 - floorLevel);

The horizon thickness of branches varies from roughly 2 to 7, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 1 to 7.
<!--
float thickness = randomSource.nextFloat() * 0.5F + 0.5F;    //[0.5, 1.0)

double horizonThickness = horizonRadius * 2;
double verticalThickness = verticalRadius * (1 - floorLevel);
-->

A cave may connect to the surface of the terrain, creating natural entrances to the cave. They sometimes connect to the sea. Caves and [[mineshafts]] also regularly contain at least minor [[water]] or [[lava]] flows as well as caves being made up of a number of aquifers of water and lava.

Some biome decoration might appear as well. For example, in [[jungle]] biomes, [[vines]] generate in carver caves near the surface, while [[sculk]] and related blocks may appear in the [[deep dark]].

=== Nether carver cave ===
The carver cave generation in the Nether starts from Y=0 to Y=126.

Their main rooms vary from roughly 2 to 8 blocks in height, and from roughly 5 to 15 blocks in diameter. Compared to caves in the Overworld, the vertical thickness of the caves in the Nether is higher. The horizontal thickness of trunks varies from roughly 3 to 15, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 12 to 64. The horizontal thickness of branches varies from roughly 3 to 5, while the vertical thickness of trunks varies from roughly 12 to 22.

==== Underwater carver caves ====
[[File:Underwater Cave.png|thumb|right|An underwater cave, flooded completely with water.]]

Underwater caves are completely flooded caves that may have [[underwater magma]].

Being completely underwater, only the magma blocks provide any air for entities to breathe, since they generate [[bubble column]]s. They sometimes have [[seagrass]], but [[kelp]] cannot generate due to being exposed to the sky, unlike sea-access caves.
{{-}}

== Structures and features ==
=== Monster room ===
{{main|Monster Room}}
Monster rooms, formerly called dungeons, are structure-like [[feature]]s that appear in the underground that contain [[monster spawner]]s. They are small rooms made of cobblestone and mossy cobblestone and contain a monster spawner and up to 2 [[chest]]s. Finding a monster room without a chest is unlikely but possible.

=== Ancient city ===
{{main|Ancient City}}
An ancient city is a palatial structure found in the deep dark, harboring chests containing items that cannot be found anywhere else or that help a player avoid a warden. An ancient city features a large palace that stretches throughout a deep dark biome. The palace is made up of long corridors with gray wool floors to prevent vibrations as well as some smaller ruins off to the side of the main corridors, which contain between one or two loot chests. The city center features a frame resembling a warden's head, where there are reinforced deepslate blocks, which is an unobtainable material in Survival mode. Other unique blocks such as soul lanterns and candles as well as different forms of deepslate can be found here.

=== Mineshaft ===
{{main|Mineshaft}}
A mineshaft is a generated structure found underground or underwater, having mazes of tunnels with cave spiders and ores exposed on the walls or floor regularly.

=== Lava lake ===
{{main|Lava lake}}
[[File:LavaLake.png|right|thumb|Example of an underground lava lake.]]

Lava lakes may generate underground with an air pocket, which makes them look like small caves with lava aquifers.

=== Amethyst geode ===
{{main|Amethyst geode}}
An amethyst geode is a [[feature]] found in the underground of the [[Overworld]]. Amethyst geodes contain [[smooth basalt]], [[calcite]], and are the only source, apart from Ancient City and Trial Chambers chests, of [[amethyst cluster|amethyst]] [[amethyst shard|item]]s and [[block of amethyst|block]]s.
{{-}}

== Cave biomes ==
There are some [[biome]]s generated only in caves in the Overworld.

=== Dripstone caves ===
{{main|Dripstone Caves}}
A dripstone cave is an underground biome often found far away from oceans, in areas with high [[continentalness]] values. It features a landscape covered by speleothems, taking the form of patches of [[pointed dripstone]] and large [[dripstone block]] pillars. Small sources of water can be found on the floor. [[Drowned]] can spawn here in aquifers.

=== Lush caves ===
{{main|Lush Caves}}
A lush cave is an underground biome that is usually found below biomes with high [[humidity]] values, such as [[dark forest]]s and [[old growth taiga]]s. It is filled with unique flora, [[cave vine]]s covering the roof, and [[clay]] pools of [[water]] on the bottom. This biome can be found underground below [[azalea tree]]s. [[Axolotl]]s and [[tropical fish]] can spawn here.

=== Deep dark ===
{{main|Deep Dark}}
The deep dark mainly generates deep underground in the deepslate layer, usually in mountainous areas with low [[Biome#Erosion|erosion]] values, and never below an ocean. The floor in this biome often has patches of [[sculk]] blocks surrounded by [[sculk vein]]s, which include sculk-related blocks such as [[sculk shrieker]]s, [[sculk sensor]]s, and [[sculk catalyst]]s. No mobs spawn  naturally in this biome, but if a player triggers the sculk shriekers a certain amount of times, the [[warden]], a powerful hostile mob, may appear, giving the player the [[Darkness]] effect. This biome may contain one or more [[ancient cities]].
