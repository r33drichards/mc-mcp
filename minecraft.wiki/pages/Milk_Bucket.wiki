A '''milk bucket''' is a [[drink]] obtained from {{Control|using}} a [[bucket]] on [[cow]]s, [[mooshroom]]s and [[goat]]s that can be consumed to clear all [[effect]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Harvesting ===
Milk buckets can be obtained from [[cow]]s, [[mooshroom]]s, and [[goat]]s by pressing {{control|use}} while looking at them with an empty [[bucket]].

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|milk-bucket}}

=== Mob loot ===
A milk bucket has an 8.5% chance of dropping from a [[wandering trader]], if the trader is killed while holding it. The drop chance increases by 1% per level of [[Looting]] used (max chance 11.5% with [[Looting|Looting III]]).  

== Usage ==
To drink milk, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Drinking it immediately removes all status [[effect]]s from the [[player]] and returns an empty [[bucket]]. Note that [[fire]] is not a status effect; therefore, drinking milk doesn't extinguish a burning player.

{{IN|je}}, the drinking animation for milk is shown only in first-person camera mode.

The benefits of area status effects granted by [[beacon]]s and [[conduit]]s are restored almost immediately {{in|be}} and after a few seconds {{in|je}}.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Milk Bucket}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s occasionally purchase a milk bucket for 2 [[emerald]]s.
