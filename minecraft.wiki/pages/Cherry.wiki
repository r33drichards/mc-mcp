'''Cherry''' [[tree]]s are found in [[cherry grove]]s. Cherry trees have distinct pink leaves and curved branches.. As with [[oak]]s and [[birch]]es, a cherry tree grown near flowers can generate with a [[bee nest]] attached.

== Appearance ==
Cherry trees are formed in a way bearing some similarity to [[acacia]]s; they can generate with multiple canopies supported by separate branches.

== Generation ==
Cherry trees spawn naturally only in the [[cherry grove]] biome.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from cherry:
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Cherry Planks}} (crafted from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Cherry Log}} (created by using an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Cherry Log}} (harvested with any [[tool]] including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Cherry Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{BlockLink|Cherry Sapling}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Bee Nest}} (if present on a tree near flowers)

== Planting ==
[[Cherry sapling]]s can be planted on:
*{{BlockLink|Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Podzol}}
*{{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
*{{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Farmland}}
*{{BlockLink|Mud}}
*{{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}

A cherry tree requires a 5×5 area of unobstructed space 8 blocks above its sapling to grow (9 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (a sapling planted in a hole 1 block deep can still grow). Their growth is not hindered by logs, leaves or saplings.

Based on 1000+ iterations of using a command block to replace the cherry log trunk with a sapling and spamming bone meal, the maximum dimensions of a cherry tree is 11 blocks tall, 17x17 wide, consisting of leaves that are 9x9 rounded tubes whose center is 6 blocks off of the ground, spreading north south east and west, with some hanging leaves underneath. The branches can spread as far as 5 blocks from the center trunk, however the south and west side is missing the 5th block at the 3rd layer. The trunk of the tree is always at least 2 blocks tall, with branches beginning as low as the 3rd Y layer and extending up to the 8th Y layer.

A cherry tree grown from a sapling and within 2 blocks of a flower has a 5% chance of having a bee nest containing 2–3 bees.

== Trivia ==
* In real life, cherry blossoms are the flowers of trees in the [[wikipedia:Prunus_subg._Cerasus|''Cerasus'']] subgenus of the genus [[wikipedia:Prunus|''Prunus'']].
* During early development of the cherry grove biome, the developers used the pigs texture as a placeholder for the leaves.<ref>{{Ytl|GYO8KejSodg|Minecraft 1.20: Sniffer Secrets & Cherry Groves|Minecraft|May 14, 2023|t=240}}</ref>
