The '''rascal''' was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2022 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[Minecraft Live 2022]], alongside the [[sniffer]] and [[tuff golem]].<ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2022-rascal|Mob Vote 2022: Rascal|October 4, 2023|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> It was a mob that would have been found underground in areas below y=0. The rascal would have given the player hints to help search for it, and would have also given the player an item if it was found three times. Once the rascal had given the player the item, it would have teleported away.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-live-2022-the-details|MINECRAFT LIVE 2022: THE DETAILS|October 13, 2023|Sofia Dankis}}</ref>

In the preview video, an iron pickaxe is shown being given by the rascal. However, that was just one example of the items it would have given the player.<ref>{{tweet|DiamondGamerAsh|1577939255728705536|@jeb_ @kingbdogz @_Ulraf_ Can you please explain a bit more about Rascal?
