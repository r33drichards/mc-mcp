[[File:MCLive2021MobVoteAllOptions.png|thumb|right|The three options for the mob vote.]]
As with [[MINECON Earth 2017]] and [[Minecraft Live 2020]], viewers were able to vote for a new mob to be added to the game in a future update. Each mob received its own video justifying its inclusion.

The mobs that were on the vote were the glare, allay, and the copper golem.

*The [[glare]]<ref>{{ytl|uYIQsr9vsws|Minecraft Live 2021: Vote for the glare!|Minecraft|October 11, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2021-glare|Mob Vote 2021 Glare|October 11, 2021|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> would have been a small ghost-like mob that would have been able to alert players to an area that is dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn in.

*The [[allay]]<ref name="allay-youtube">{{ytl|XdxGwg7cgjw|Minecraft Live 2021: Vote for the allay!|Minecraft|October 12, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{mcnet|mob-vote-2021-allay|Mob Vote 2021 Allay|October 12, 2021|Sofia Dankis}}</ref> is a small fairy-like mob that is able to collect greater amounts of an item that is given to it. It picks up dropped items in loaded chunks and is able to carry up to a stack at a time,<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q81usv/comment/hgmfpl6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3</ref> and is not able to duplicate items<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1447945258743091200|Allays are not item duplicators, they pick up items nearby on the floor that are the same item it has been given. So you could give it a dirt block, then it will find dirt blocks that are dropped, collect them, then return and drop them to you or a note block you've set up.|October 12, 2021}}</ref> or take items out of chests.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1447945260366286853|They cannot get items from chests either.

This idea was scrapped in 2021, but returned for [[The Copper Age]] drop in 2025. <!--It would have been attracted to copper buttons, which would also come with the golem had it won.<ref name="copper-tweet" /> According to Ulraf on Twitter, the copper golem would have the oxidation removed with either an axe,<ref>{{tweet|_Ulraf_|1448304488570363905|Like with copper blocks, you can use an axe to scrape away the golem to clean it!|October 13, 2021}}</ref> or being struck by lightning.<ref>{{tweet|_Ulraf_|1448306663585456137|That lightning rod on it's head is not just for show 😉 Yes it will!|October 13, 2021}}</ref> It would also have turned into a statue at full oxidation.<ref>[https://twitter.com/_Ulraf_/status/1448307567323750403 "YES"] in response to a question about if the copper golem would become a statue when fully oxidized – [https://twitter.com/_Ulraf_ @_Ulraf_] on Twitter, October 13, 2021</ref>--> 

The mobs that lost the mob vote are shelved indefinitely, and may or may not be added in the future.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q81usv/comment/hgmlk3g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3</ref>
Despite having lost the vote, the copper golem has been selected to be part of the Copper Age drop.

==== Results ====
Voting took place in two rounds. The losing mob, the glare, was eliminated from consideration after the first round. The winner of the second and final round was the allay.
