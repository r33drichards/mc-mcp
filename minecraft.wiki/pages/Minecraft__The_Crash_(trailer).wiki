'''Minecraft: The Crash''' is a trailer promoting the release of [[Minecraft: The Crash (map)|Minecraft: The Crash]], a world promoting the release of [[Minecraft: The Crash]].

== Summary ==
The video opens on [[Bianca]] awakening in a [[taiga]], confused, before stumbling upon a mansion. After passing by what appears to be a tollbooth, she enters the building, lit by redstone lamps, and discovers her friends have been turned into [[endermen]]. Seeing them contained inside of [[Gray Stained Glass Pane|pods]], she elects to cure them of the "curse of the endermen." To do this, she places several items in an oversized [[Stained Terracotta|cauldron]], pushes a [[Minecart with Chest|minecart]], discovers a secret door in a bookshelf, and finally places four keys into [[item frames]]. As she enters into a hedge maze, the camera pans to an overhead view of the area, ending the video.
