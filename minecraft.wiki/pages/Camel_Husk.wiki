A '''camel husk''' is an [[undead]] variant of the [[camel]] that rarely spawns at [[night]] or during [[thunderstorm]]s in [[desert]]s as a [[hostile mob]], being ridden and controlled by an [[iron spear]]-wielding [[husk]] with a [[parched]] passenger, known as a '''camel husk jockey'''. It does not burn in [[sun]]light, and is [[passive]] once separated from its riders.

== Spawning ==
{{anchor|Camel husk jockey}}
In {{JE}}, when a [[husk]] spawns [[spawn cycle|naturally]] and spawns in a space that does not block the collision box required for a camel husk, it has a 10% chance to spawn as a '''camel husk jockey''', i.e. riding a camel husk, and spawning a [[parched]] as the second passenger. Within a spawning pack of husks, only one of them can spawn as a camel husk jockey. If the husk is a baby husk and was supposed to spawn as [[chicken jockey]], the [[chicken]] will be spawned (and can despawn), but the baby husk will ride the camel husk.

In this state, the camel husk's movement is controlled by the front passenger. This will initially be the husk; if the husk dismounts or is killed, the parched will instead take control. When both passengers are killed or dismount the camel husk, it becomes passive. It can then subsequently be ridden by players like a regular [[camel]].

Camel husks count towards the "monster" [[mob cap]] and can despawn like most hostile mobs until the first time any player interacts with it. At that point it becomes persistent and no longer counts towards any mob cap either.  

Camel husks do not spawn in [[Peaceful]] difficulty, like other [[monster]]s. Baby camel husks cannot spawn naturally and are only accessible through [[commands]].

In {{BE}}, camel husks spawn by weight on their own, and like {{in|java}}, never by itself:

* {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].
* These are the drops for the camel husk. Any passengers need to die separately, and drop items separately, like other [[jockey]]s.

Killing a baby camel husk yields no items or experience.

Camel husks spawn as hostile mobs due to being ridden by hostile mobs, targeting the player as its pathfinding is controlled by the riders. However, they will become passive once the riders are killed, behaving similarly to regular camels, but cannot breed. They are under two other different categories, [[monster]] and [[undead]], rather than just [[animal]] for regular camels. {{IN|be}}, camel husks get up immediately once the player rides them with a [[saddle]] while sitting; {{in|je}}, they get up once the player moves {{ctrl|forwards}}.

Camel husks have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

[[Rabbit's feet]] can be used to tempt and heal camel husks.

{{IN|BE}}, camel husks don't panic when damaged.{{upcoming|BE 26.0}}

{{IN|Java}}, camel husks are never spawned as part of a [[zombie siege]], but if a camel husk jockey naturally spawns nearby, it will join the siege and behave like all other zombies.

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[Wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Unlike most undead mobs, camel husks do not burn in sunlight.

As they are also [[monsters]], camel husks count towards the hostile mob cap. However, once a player gets onto a camel husk for the first time, it stops counting towards any mob cap and will no longer despawn, similar to having a [[name tag]] applied.

As they are considered monsters, [[parrot]]s can imitate them.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, camel husks prevent the player from sleeping and are killed by the [[conduit]] like the other undead mounts.{{until|BE 26.0}}

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}
Camel husks can be ridden as long as there are not already two riders. The riding behavior of camel husks is identical to regular camels.

Camel husks have one slot in their inventory for equipping a [[saddle]]. A saddle can be placed on a camel husk by holding it and then {{control|using}} it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory. A camel husk's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel husk and using {{control|inventory}} control, or by {{control|sneaking}} and then {{control|using}} or pressing the "open inventory" button{{only|bedrock}} on the camel husk.

Once a camel husk is saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, {{control|jump}}, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control. A second player can then ride as a passenger. If the controlling passenger disembarks, then the second passenger takes control of the camel husk.

Camel husks move at the same speed as regular camels. They gradually gain speed while moving in a straight line, up to a walking speed of 3.885 blocks/s, and can also manually [[sprint]] at a speed of 8.203 blocks/s by double tapping {{control|forward}} or by holding the {{control|sprint}} control while moving forward.

{{anchor|Dashing|Dash}}Saddled camel husks also have the ability of "dashing". When the player rides them, the experience bar on the [[HUD]] is replaced by a dash charging bar, similar to the jump charging bar for horses. Dashing is done using the jump control, and holding the control charges for a longer dashing. Camel husks can dash every 2.75 seconds. When dashing, the camel husk launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward. For a short time after dashing, the camel husk cannot sprint. 

Baby camel husks cannot be equipped or ridden.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Camel husks are referred to by Mojang as neutral mobs, likely due to their status as hostile while being ridden by husks and parched.<ref name="neutral">{{ytl|BL1oYVfNMNY|TWO NEW MOBS INCOMING! {{!}} MINECRAFT MONTHLY|Minecraft|October 28, 2025|t=247s}}</ref>
* Unlike the regular camel, the camel husk saddle texture file is separated from the camel, instead of being together.
* {{IN|je}}, camel husks have an unused baby variant.
** Feeding a baby camel husk a rabbit's foot accelerates the baby's growth by 10 seconds.
*Shooting an arrow that hits a camel husk does not count as an interaction, thus not making it persistent.
