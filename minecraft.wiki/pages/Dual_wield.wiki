'''Dual wielding''' is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows players (and [[mob]]s) to hold two [[item]]s or [[block]]s{{only|Java}} simultaneously.

== Usage ==

{{see also|Tutorial:Dual wielding}}

Players can equip an item to the 
{{slotSprite|Offhand|scale=0.5|align=text-top}} off-hand slot from the [[inventory]], similarly to [[armor]]. Players can also select an item and press {{key|F}} by default to automatically equip it. The off-hand slot then appears beside the [[HUD]] opposite from the main hand. If the player is in [[first-person view]], then the off-hand appears in the screen along with the held item. Whichever hand should be the main hand is configurable in the [[Options#Skin Customization|Skin Customization]] menu.

The off-hand can use the item it holds when there are no items with a {{ctrl|use}} function in the main hand (e.g. [[trident]]s, which can be thrown), or the item held on the main hand cannot be used directly (e.g. [[axe]] while not looking at a [[log]], [[wood]], or an [[oxidized]]/[[waxed]] [[Copper#Oxidizing blocks|copper block]]). Otherwise, the main hand takes priority over the off-hand. Players also cannot {{control|break}} blocks or {{control|attack}} with the off-hand, even if nothing is held in the main hand.

=== Combat ===

A player can equip a [[bow]], [[crossbow]], [[spear]], or [[trident]] in their off-hand. So far, these are the only weapons that can be used in the off-hand slot or in conjunction with another weapon. This allows for higher damage output, as players no longer have to switch between weapons; however, it disables the use of a [[shield]]. Players can left-click to attack with the equipped main-hand weapon (namely a sword or [[mace]]) and right click to attack with the off-hand weapon. However, if a [[player]] collides with an [[entity]] or another player while using a [[Riptide]]-enchanted trident, damage is dealt with the item in the player's main hand.

[[Shield]]s can be held in the off-hand as defense. They do not take priority over the main hand, and cannot be used if the main hand item has a {{ctrl|use}} functionality (such as a bow or spear).

[[Arrow]]s held in the off-hand are prioritized over other arrows in the [[hotbar]] and the inventory. Players can equip a specific arrow in their off-hand slot to fire it with a bow. If the bow is held in the off-hand, then the arrow selected on the hotbar (with the main hand) is prioritized.

=== Tool use ===
When a tool with a right-click function is held in the off-hand with another tool or weapon selected in the hotbar, right-clicking on a block that is relevant to the off-hand tool uses that off-hand tool unless the selected tool in the hotbar can also be used on the same block, in which case the hotbar tool has priority.

When a [[firework]] is in the off-hand slot and is being used with a crossbow, right-click and hold to charge and when ready, right click again to fire a firework. Fireworks can be fired from crossbows only when in the off-hand slot.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, only a select few [[item]]s can be placed in the off-hand slot and be dual-wielded. Some are related to combat, like [[shield]]s, [[arrow]]s, [[tipped arrow]]s, [[firework rocket]]s or a [[totem of undying]], while others are for exploring, like [[filled map]]s or [[explorer map]]s, and for aesthetic such as [[sparkler]]s{{Only|education}} and [[nautilus shell]]s. Other items can be placed into the off-hand slot by using the {{cd|/replaceitem}} command, but most items are unusable.

=== Mobs ===
Some mobs are also able to dual-wield, albeit to a more limited degree. For mobs that cannot pick up items, [[command]]s must be used in order for them to dual-wield.

The following mobs can dual-wield items:
* {{EntityLink|Zombie}}
* {{EntityLink|Husk}}
* {{EntityLink|Drowned}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie Villager}}
* {{EntityLink|Skeleton}}
* {{EntityLink|Stray}}
* {{EntityLink|Bogged}}
* {{EntityLink|Parched}}
* {{EntityLink|Wither Skeleton}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombified Piglin}}
* {{EntityLink|Piglin}}
* {{EntityLink|Piglin Brute}}
* {{EntityLink|Pillager}}
* {{EntityLink|Vindicator}}
* {{EntityLink|Evoker}}
* {{EntityLink|Vex}}

Mobs do not actively use/consume most items or blocks in their off-hand, with a few exepctions:
* {{ItemLink|Totem of Undying}} - used when the mob takes [[death|fatal damage]].
* {{ItemLink|Arrow}}, {{ItemLink|Spectral Arrow}}, {{ItemLink|Tipped Arrow}}, {{ItemLink|Firework Rocket}} - used when an applicable mob is holding a [[bow]] or [[crossbow]] in their main hand. The held item is consumed when used as ammunition.

When a mob picks up a [[shield]], they place it in their offhand if the slot is available.

[[Drowned]] are the only mob that can naturally spawn dual-wielding items, those being a [[trident]]/[[fishing rod]] in the main hand and a [[nautilus shell]] in the off-hand.

[[Piglin]]s temporarily dual-wield when [[bartering]]/inspecting a gold-related item while holding a weapon.
