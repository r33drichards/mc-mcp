The '''wooded hills''' or '''forest hills''' was a hills variant of the [[forest]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''. 

== Description ==
The wooded hills biome generated as hills inside forests, and sometimes in [[plains]] biomes. The biome was similar to forests, with much more hills, cliffs, and floating islands, making it less suitable for survival. [[Wolf|Wolves]] spawned here.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs spawned naturally here:
