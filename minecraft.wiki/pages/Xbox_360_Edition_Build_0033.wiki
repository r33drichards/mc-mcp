'''Build 0033''' (or '''Build 1.66.0033.0''') is a development version of {{edition|xbox 360}}. This version is based off [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]].

The only archived copy of this build (labelled "Minecraft Reloaded") was tampered with, containing an edited <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> using textures from the [https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/moderncraft-official/ ModernCraft] texture pack.<ref>https://youtu.be/xBx-O7RYtOY?t=512</ref>. Despite what is often claimed, these textures were added to the game by a third party, and were not used officially by 4J Studios. The mipmapped versions of <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> were not edited, so distant blocks still use the vanilla textures. The modified Xbox dashboard description states "Minecraft with custom textures and stuff. v0.1a".
