'''1.14''', the release of '''[[Village & Pillage]]''' and the '''[[Texture Update]]''', is a major update to {{JE}} released on April 23, 2019.<ref>{{Mcnet|village---pillage-out-java-|Village and Pillage out today on Java|April 23, 2019}}</ref> It focuses mainly on [[village]]s, adding a new type of [[illager]]s known as [[pillager]]s, and redesigns village architecture to match the [[biome]] it is located in. This update also introduces many new blocks and mobs, revamps the crafting system by moving some functionalities to different blocks, updates the [[taiga]] biome with [[fox]]es and [[sweet berries]], and adds a new [[bamboo jungle]] biome along with [[bamboo]] and [[panda]]s. It is also the first major release to include the new textures of the [[Texture Update]].

Originally, 1.14 was planned to be the version number for [[Update Aquatic]], but the numbering was changed when the ''Technically Updated'' release (planned earlier as 1.13) was merged<ref>{{Mcnet|java-edition-technically-updated|Java Edition Technically Updated|January 24, 2018}}</ref> with the actual ''Update Aquatic'' [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]], making 1.14 version number available for the next (i.e. ''Village & Pillage'') update.

The update was originally revealed during the [[MINECON Earth 2018]] livestream on September 29, 2018.<ref>{{ytl|HoMDyRqMNMA|MINECON Earth 2018 – New content reveal}}</ref>

This is the first version released in 2019.

[[File:All Profession Levels.png|thumb|right|250px|All five profession levels, indicated by the badges on their suits.]]
'''[[Villager]]s'''
[[File:Villager trading 1.14.jpg|thumb|All trades for each profession and tiers.]]
* Villagers and [[zombie villager]]s now have seven skin types which correspond to the following biomes:
** Plains
** Desert
** Savanna
** Taiga
** Snowy tundra/snowy taiga
** Jungle
** Swamp
* Added new mason profession.
* Revamped trading UI.
** Available trades are listed in a left sidebar, similar to {{BE}}. 
** When players have the required materials, clicking on one of the trades puts the items into the slots automatically.
* Villager AI has been rewritten, they can now sleep, and around midday, they gather at the meeting point of the village.
* All villagers spawn as nitwits (green robes) or unemployed (brown robes) when spawned by [[spawn egg]] or commands.
** Unemployed villagers have no profession initially, but change profession based on a "[[job site]]" block near them. 
* Now have levels based on XP gained from trading.
* Now have badges marking their level. 
* When hit by the player, villagers raise the price of their trades.
* Now show players their trades in their hands if the player is holding certain items, which they are trading for.
* Cured zombie villagers retain their trades when they are converted back into regular villagers.
* Villager children now play in villages.
* Villagers no longer look at players in Spectator mode.

'''[[Vindicator]]s'''
* Now break down doors.

'''[[Wolves]]'''
* Tamed wolf kills now count as a player kill. 
** E.g. a [[zombie]] can rarely drop a [[potato]] on death alongside its normal drops, or an [[illager captain]] inflict [[Bad Omen]] on death when killed by the wolf.
*** Before, tamed wolves only had mobs drop XP and their common drops upon death.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Armor stand]]s'''
* Now has a loot table.

'''{{EntityLink|id=egg|link=Egg|Thrown Egg}}, {{EntityLink|id=ender-pearl|link=Ender Pearl|Thrown Ender Pearl}}, {{EntityLink|id=experience-bottle|link=Bottle o' Enchanting|Thrown Bottle o' Enchanting}}, {{EntityLink|Eye of Ender}}, {{EntityLink|id=fireball|Ghast fireball}}, {{EntityLink|id=small-fireball|Blaze fireball}} (fire charge), and {{EntityLink|Snowball}}. '''
* Now have an optional {{code|Item}} tag that can specify a different item stack to render.
<!-- Sample commands for messing with this:
/summon minecraft:eye_of_ender ^ ^1 ^1 {Item:{Count:1b,id:"minecraft:end_portal_frame"}}
/summon fireball ~ ~ ~ {Item:{Count:1b, id:"minecraft:dragon_egg"},NoGravity:1b,direction:[0.0,0.0,0.0],ExplosionPower:5}
/summon small_fireball ~ ~ ~ {Item:{Count:1b, id:"minecraft:dragon_egg"},NoGravity:1b,direction:[0.0,0.0,0.0]}
(note https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-140959 for the last one).

Also, note that dragon fireball and wither skull do not have one of these, even though ghast fireball does despite not having an item form. -->

'''[[Minecart with TNT]]'''
* Explosions now have a 100% drop rate.

'''[[Paintings]]'''
* Now broken up into individual textures.

* Village detection is now based on beds, job sites and meeting points instead of doors.
* {{BiomeLink|Plains}}, {{BiomeLink|Desert}}, {{BiomeLink|Savanna}} and {{BiomeLink|Taiga}} villages have a new architecture.
** Village houses now have drastically different structures that depend on the biome and there are many more types.
** Use [[jigsaw block]]s for generation.
* Added new structure and loot table files for the new village houses.

'''[[Swamp hut]]s'''
* Now generate with a black [[cat]].

'''[[Zombie village]]s'''
* Updated plains, desert, savanna, and taiga zombie villages.

'''[[The Nether]]'''
* [[Soul sand]] and [[gravel]] now generate below Y-level 34 at [[lava sea]] level, instead of between Y-level 60 and 65.<ref>{{bug|MC-152207}} Resolved as "Works As Intended"</ref>
** A possible reason for this tweak was to accommodate for the increased availability of soul sand in the upcoming [[Nether Update]], as the idea of [[soul sand valley]] biome had likely been envisioned by the developers while 1.14 was still in development.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Entity type predicates now accept tags ({{code|#baz}}).

** Inside single-quoted strings, double quotes are handled as a normal character and requires no escaping (and vice-versa), making it easier to input text components in NBT.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Crafting]]'''
* Recipes for combining damaged items have been removed; these are now done using the grindstone.

'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* The [[Protection]], [[Blast Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], and [[Projectile Protection]] enchantments are no longer mutually exclusive.

'''[[Lighting]] system'''
* Has been rewritten.
** Moved light storage from [[chunk]]s to a separate structure.
** Moved light calculation from all over the code to a self-contained place.
** Moved light computation off the main thread on the server.

'''[[Sneaking]]'''
* Now reduces the player's height to 1.5 blocks, allowing them to walk through 1.5-block-tall gaps.

'''[[Status effect]]s'''
* Each individual status effect icon texture is now found in a separate texture file.
* [[Luck]] and [[Bad Luck]] have had their icons updated.
* Improved the [[Invisibility]] status effect to allow it to correctly work in many cases where it didn't.
** Guardians no longer see invisible players.
** Zombies and illagers no longer see invisible villagers and wandering traders.

[[File:Minecraft villager level badges.png|thumb|Villager badge changes color depending on the level of the villager. From left to right: stone (novice), iron (apprentice), gold (journeyman), emerald (expert), and diamond (master).]]
'''[[Trading]]'''
* Added many new villager trades, for each villager profession.
** Villager trading prices now also depend on demand and player's popularity in the village.
* Villagers now resupply their trades up to two times a day, if they get to work at a job site block.
* Updated the villager trading UI.
* Villagers now level up from gaining experience by trading with a player.
** Villagers have five profession levels, showing how many trade tiers they've unlocked by a badge of a varying material on their suit: novice, apprentice, journeyman, expert, and master.
** The first trade tier is represented by a stone badge, the next iron, then gold, emerald and finally diamond.
** Some of the professions have less than five trade tiers in total.
*** If a villager summoned by a command has a higher level than its natural highest level, its badge can still be seen, however, the player wouldn't be able to interact with it.
** A little experience bar is shown at the top of the trading UI. Once the bar fills up from trading, exiting the UI and waiting briefly levels up the villager and show pink particles similar to those shown when refreshing trades in previous versions of the game.
** Experience that exceeds the level up amount seems to roll over between level ups.
** The experience bar disappears once the villager becomes master level.
** Every time a new level is reached, 1-2 new trade offers appear.
** The villager's experience gained per trade is based on the trade itself, the level the trade was unlocked at (novice, apprentice, etc.), and the current level of the villager.
*** Lower level trades give less experience toward a level up once the villager is a higher level.

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* "A Balanced Diet"
** Now also requires [[suspicious stew]] and [[sweet berries]].
* "How Did We Get Here?"
** Now requires {{EffectLink|Saturation}} and {{EffectLink|Blindness}} as these effects can be obtained through [[suspicious stew]].
* "Monsters Hunted"
** No longer requires [[polar bear]]s.
* "Monster Hunter"
** Polar bears no longer serve as a valid mob to trigger this advancement.
* "The Parrots and the Bats" and "Best Friends Forever"
** Requirements have been changed from [[ocelot]]s to [[cat]]s.

'''Collision code'''
* Improved collision code.

'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Wall blocks are now found in the "Decoration Blocks" tab.

'''[[Credits]]'''
* Updated the credits list.
* Updated the game credits to include more Mojang staff.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Pressing {{key|Alt+F3}} shows a server-side ticks-per-second chart in singleplayer.
* Added {{code|delimiter=/|min|avg|max}} tick times to {{key|Alt+F3}} charts to help find stutters.

'''Dedicated [[servers]]'''
* [[server.properties]]
** {{cd|difficulty}} and {{cd|gamemode}} settings now accept string names; integer values are still allowed as legacy option.
* Server now exits faster if {{cd|eula.txt}} is not set.
* Command line
** Added new option {{cd|--help}}.
** Added new command line option {{cd|initSettings}}.
*** Initializes {{cd|eula.txt|server.properties|d=and}} with defaults, then exits.

'''Language'''
* Now changes the language after clicking on the 'Done' button to avoid having to wait after accidentally clicking an unwanted language option.
** Before, language changed immediately after choosing a different language option.

'''Loading screen'''
* Now shows a progress bar.

'''[[LWJGL]]'''
* Updated to 3.2.1.

'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Updated panorama background to show the new village structures.
** The menu panorama uses seed <code>2802867088795589976</code> at coordinates X = 240.57, Y = 78.12, Z = 147.38

'''[[Options|Menu]]s'''
* Menu buttons, edit boxes, and other UI elements can now be cycled through by pressing {{key|Tab}}.
** {{key|Shift+Tab}} goes backwards.
* Lists allow {{key|Up}}/{{key|Down}} arrow keys to navigate through them.

'''[[Narrator]]'''
* Now found in settings.
* Reads hovered over buttons out loud.

'''Optimizations'''
* Inside the optimize world screen there is now an option to remove cached world data (e.g., height maps and light), so that it is re-computed when the world is next loaded.
* Optimized nether portals.
** They now keep the other side loaded for 15 seconds after an entity goes through.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Accessibility Settings".
** All accessibility features are now easily toggled within the settings.
** "Auto-Jump" is now also listed in accessibility settings.
* Added a new option that allows turning up transparent backgrounds.
* Transparency setting is now labeled "Chat Text Opacity" instead of "Chat Opacity".
* Removed "Snooper Settings". However, the snooper setting is still configurable in [[options.txt]] (<code>snooperEnabled</code>).
* "Sensitivity", "Invert Mouse" and "Touchscreen Mode" have been moved to a subsection "Mouse Settings".
* Added new options: "Scroll Sensitivity" and "Discrete Scrolling", also in "Mouse Settings"; these fix {{bug|MC-123773}}.
** Scroll sensitivity is a multiplier for scroll magnitude; the setting was first added in [[18w21a]] but was only accessible by editing <code>mouseWheelSensitivity</code> in [[options.txt]].
** Discrete scrolling tells the game to ignore scroll magnitude values given by the operating system and instead to act as if the operating system supplied &minus;1 or +1. <!-- i.e. signum(input) --> These are influenced by the sensitivity afterwards, if needed.
** If unwanted scrolling occurs, enable discrete scrolling and set the sensitivity to 1.

'''[[Particle]]s'''
* Are now broken up into individual textures files per frame rather than being in {{cd|particles.png}}.
** Do not use {{cd|.mcmeta}} files for their animation – those are still hard-coded.
* Sprites for particles can now be configured in resource packs.

'''Pause screen'''
* Added "Give Feedback" and "Report Bugs" buttons.

'''Player positioning'''
* The player's position now adjusts to the gap they are within:
** 1.5 blocks: sneaking posture
** <1 block: swimming animation
* Being forced into an area under two blocks high causes the player to adopt the appropriate posture.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Rewrote sound system.
* Reduced stuttering when playing sounds.
* Global sounds now always play at full volume. Previously they were just played at the player's position, which made it possible for them to become quieter or stop being audible if the player moved while it was playing.

'''[[Splash]]'''
* Removed "Hobo humping slobo babe!"
* Removed splashes referencing [[Notch]]:
** "Made by Notch!"
** "The Work of Notch!"
** "110813!"

'''Technical'''
* Added support for directional opacity of [[block]]s (used by [[slab]]s, [[stairs]], [[snow]], [[farmland]], [[grass path]]s, extended [[piston]]s (base and head), [[End portal frame]]s, and [[enchanting table]]s).

'''Textures'''
* [[Texture Update|All textures have been updated]].
** New consistent set of [[block]], [[item]], [[mob]], effect, GUI, etc. textures made by [[Jasper Boerstra]].
** Old textures are offered as a [[resource pack]] called "Programmer Art".

'''Video settings'''
* 'Use VBOs' toggle removed. Now always enabled.<ref>{{tweet|SeargeDP|1060455384471793664|The question about the VBO option in the latest snapshots came up a few times. It's been removed on purpose and VBO will now always be used. This is one of the first side effects of the ongoing work we do to improve the rendering engine. #JustBlaze3DThings|November 8, 2018}}</ref>

'''World creation'''
* New progress message: "Upgrading structure data".
* Worlds with names already being used now prepend to the folder name a number in parentheses instead of adding hyphens (e.g., "New World (3)" instead of "New World---").
