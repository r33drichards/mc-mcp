** {{nbt|compound|filtered_pages}}: Only in [[Realms]]. The pages shown to players with the profanity filter turned on instead of some of the regular pages. This compound is automatically given a tag named after the page number and set to {{code|""}} when a player with the profanity filter turned ''off'' closes a book with that specific page containing one or more blocked words, so players with the filter ''on'' cannot see the blocked words. If a player with the filter ''on'' tries to use blocked words in one or more of the pages, this compound is not given any new tags and the specific page(s) in {{nbt|list|pages}} are instead set to {{code|""}}, which makes the page(s) render completely blank. If multiple pages have been edited before the book is closed, only the pages containing blocked words are blanked.
** {{nbt|list|pages}}: The list of pages in the book.
*** {{nbt|string}}: A single page in the book. Each page is a string and uses the escape sequence <code>\n</code> for a line break. However, the [[Brigadier|command parser]] does not accept <code>\n</code>, so line breaks need to be set by a [[player]] or using [[loot table]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-119659}}</ref>
