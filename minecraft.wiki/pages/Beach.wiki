'''Beaches''' are common coastal [[biome]]s that serve as transition biomes from the mainland to an [[ocean]]. Beaches are covered entirely with [[sand]] and are the main source of [[turtle]]s and [[buried treasure]]s.

== Description ==
Beaches generate on the coast. Beaches do not always surround land biomes, allowing them to border the ocean. Beaches sometimes can also generate bordering [[river]]s or be completely landlocked.

Beaches don't have many resources of their own. [[Buried treasure]]s often generate buried under most beaches, and [[shipwreck]]s occasionally generate on beaches. [[Turtle]]s may spawn on regular beaches, and along with rabbits in snowy beaches {{in|bedrock}}, they are the only [[passive mob]]s that can spawn in beach biomes, although other passive mobs can wander into beaches from surrounding biomes. [[Drowned]] often spawn in the water surrounding beaches. [[Ocean ruins]] generated in the ocean nearby may spread onto beaches, causing some ruins to form on land.

Beaches are composed of mostly [[sand]], with some [[gravel]], [[dirt]], and [[clay]] patches under the [[water]], similarly to [[river]]s. Like the sand in [[desert]]s, [[sandstone]] generates underneath it. Beach terrain is usually a smooth descent into the water, though it can vary in steepness and width. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], beaches use a coolish humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which slightly fades the distance in an orange tint. Beaches have default atmospherics, lighting, and color grading like temperate biomes.
