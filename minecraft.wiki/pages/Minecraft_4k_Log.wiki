{{info needed section|describe the code used - can be found at https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/MC-TextureGen}}The texture for logs were generated by the game at runtime (similarly to [[Procedural animated texture generation|what was done in Java Edition at that time for water and lava]]), rather than being stored inside of the jar as an image file.
