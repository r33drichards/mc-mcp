'''Slicer''' is a set of three Java utilities created to assist in upgrading [[resource pack]]s to higher versions by splitting certain [[texture atlas]]es into constituent sprites.

There are currently three versions:
* one for converting to [[Java Edition 1.14]], by splitting <samp>[[particles.png]]</samp>, <samp>[[paintings_kristoffer_zetterstrand.png]]</samp> and <samp>[[inventory.png]]</samp> into constituent particle, painting and mob effect textures
* one for converting to [[Java Edition 1.20.2]], by splitting a large number of user interface textures into individual sprites
* one for converting to [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], by splitting <samp>[[map_icons.png]]</samp> into individual map icon texture files
