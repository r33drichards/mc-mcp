'''Chainmail leggings''' are an [[Rarity#Uncommon|uncommon]] variant of [[leggings]] that cannot be crafted, and are only obtainable through other means such as [[trading]]. They are the fourth-highest [[tier]] of leggings, having higher armor points and durability than [[Golden Leggings|golden]] and [[copper leggings]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, and [[bogged]] have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include chainmail leggings. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

=== Villager gifts ===
{{IN|JE}} armorer villagers may give players with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect chainmail leggings.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|chainmail-leggings}}

== Usage ==
When worn, chainmail leggings provide {{armor|4}} [[armor points]].

==== Repairing ====
Two damaged pairs of chainmail leggings can be combined through [[crafting]] or using the [[grindstone]]. The durability of the used chainmail leggings are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either leggings.

Chainmail leggings can also be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% the leggings' maximum durability, rounded down. Two pairs of leggings of the same tier can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods using the anvil preserve the leggings' [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
Leggings can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a leggings, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
