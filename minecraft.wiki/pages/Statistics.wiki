[[File:Statistics.png|thumb|427px|The general statistics screen.]]
'''Statistics''' is a game feature that allows players to track certain tasks in the form of numerical data.

Statistics are present only in {{el|je}}. {{el|be}} has no equivalent of statistics in-game, but a part of statistics can be viewed on the player's [[profile screen]].

== Statistics screen ==

In statistics screen, statistics are divided into three sections: 
*'''General''' – The General screen displays a multitude of generic statistics that are listed in the table below.
*'''Items''' – The Items screen displays the number of times different items and blocks have been depleted, crafted, used to destroy blocks, picked up and dropped.
*'''Mobs''' – The Mob screen shows for each different type of mobs or other living entities ([[player]]s, [[armor stand]]s) how many the player has killed, or the number of deaths caused by those mobs.

The buttons at the top of the Items screen can be used to sort the list. The General and Mobs screens are sorted alphabetically.

== Resource location ==
The [[resource location]]s of statistics are unique. They are the only combination resource locations in the game.

The resource locations of statistics are in form of <code>NAMESPACE:PATH</code> as well, however, in which <code>NAMESPACE</code> is the resource location of a statistic type in form of <code>namespace.path</code>, <code>NAME</code> is the resource location of a statistic name in form of <code>namespace.path</code>.

That means, the resource locations of statistics are in form of <code>A.B:C.D</code>, in which:
* <code>A</code> is the namespace of statistic type.
* <code>B</code> is the path of statistic type.
* <code>C</code> is the namespace of statistic name.
* <code>D</code> is the path of statistic name.

For both two namespaces, it can be omitted if it is <code>minecraft</code>. For example, the following four locations work the same:
* <code>minecraft.mined:minecraft.stone</code>
* <code>mined:minecraft.stone</code>
* <code>minecraft.mined:stone</code>
* <code>mined:stone</code>

=== Statistic types and names ===

Statistics are divided into a few types. For general statistics, their type is called <code>minecraft:custom</code>. For item statistics, their types are <code>minecraft:mined</code>, <code>minecraft:broken</code>, <code>minecraft:crafted</code>, <code>minecraft:used</code>, <code>minecraft:picked_up</code>, and <code>minecraft:dropped</code>. For mob statistics, their types are <code>minecraft:killed</code> and <code>minecraft:killed_by</code>.

! [[Resource location]]
|-
| CUSTOM
|
A multitude of generic statistics related to a player's actions. Players' statistics increase automatically when they perform the action relevant to the statistic names.

The statistic name for CUSTOM is used to specify the action for statistics. See [[#List of custom statistic names]] below.
| minecraft:custom

|-

| BLOCK_MINED
|
Statistic related to the number of blocks a player mined. Players' statistic increases when the player mines a block of the specified type, only if they use a tool that would normally make the item drop (even if custom loot tables or the <code>doTileDrops</code> game rule being <code>false</code> result in no drops). It never increases for a player in Creative Mode.

The statistic name for BLOCK_MINED is used to specify the type of blocks. It can be the resource location of any block.
| minecraft:mined

|-

| ITEM_BROKEN
| 
Statistics related to the number of items a player ran their durability negative. Players' statistic increases when a player runs the durability of one item of the specified type negative. Durability runs negative when the item's durability loss–condition is met and the item already has a durability of 0.

The statistic name for ITEM_BROKEN is used to specify the type of items. It can be the resource location of any item or block for which items exist.
| minecraft:broken

|-

| ITEM_CRAFTED
| 
Statistics related to the number of items crafted, smelted, etc. Players' statistic increases by an amount equal to the number of items crafted or smelted, upon removing a block or item from the output of an interface, like a crafting table, a furnace, or a [[villager]]'s output slot.

The statistic name for ITEM_CRAFTED is used to specify the type of items. It can be the resource location of any item or block for which items exist.
| minecraft:crafted

|-

| ITEM_USED
|
Statistics related to the number of block or item used. Players' statistic increases when a player uses a block or item. "Use" is defined as when:
* A [[shovel]], a [[pickaxe]], an [[axe]], [[flint and steel]], [[shears]], a [[hoe]], a [[bow]], or a [[sword]] would normally consume durability
*: Players' statistics do not increase when [[armor]] consumes durability. Instead, they increase when [[armor]] is equipped directly with {{ctrl|use}}. 
*: Players' statistics increase even if no durability is consumed, like when a [[torch]] is destroyed with an item that takes the {{ctrl|destroy}} key to use (e.g. pickaxes).
* For the [[fishing rod]], [[carrot on a stick]] and [[Warped Fungus on a Stick|warped fungus on a stick]], the {{ctrl|use}} key is used.
* A block is placed
* A [[painting]], [[item frame]], [[snowball]], [[egg]], [[spawn egg]], any type of [[minecart]] or [[boat]], [[eye of ender]], [[ender pearl]], [[bow]], any type of throwable [[potion]], [[Bottle o' Enchanting]], or [[fishing rod]] spawns an entity
* A [[cocoa]] pod is planted on a jungle [[log]], or [[bone meal]] is used to grow plants like [[crops]], [[grass]], and saplings
* A [[potion]], bucket of [[milk]], or any [[food]] (save [[cake]]) is consumed
* An empty [[map]], empty [[bucket]], [[lava bucket]], [[water bucket]], [[milk bucket]], [[book and quill]], or [[potion]] turns into a new item
*: Players' statistics do not increase when a [[bowl]] becomes [[mushroom stew]] or a [[bucket]] becomes [[milk]].
* A [[music disc]] is placed in a [[jukebox]]
* A player's health reaches 0 while holding a [[Totem of Undying]]

Players' statistics do not increase when items are used on mobs&mdash;whether to name, tame, feed, breed, saddle, leash, shear, dye, milk, or gather stew from&mdash;when [[leather armor]] is washed in a [[cauldron]], and instances mentioned above.

The statistic name for ITEM_USED is used to specify the type of items. It can be the resource location of any item or block for which items exist.
| minecraft:used

|-

| ITEM_PICKED_UP
| 
Statistics related to the number of dropped items a player picked up. Players' statistic increases when the player picks up a dropped item of the specified type.

The statistic name for ITEM_PICKED_UP is used to specify the type of items. It can be the resource location of any item or block for which items exist.
| minecraft:picked_up

|-

| ITEM_DROPPED
| 
Statistics related to the number of items that droped. Players' statistic increases when a player drops an item of the specified type from inventory.

== Storage ==
Statistics are stored in <samp>[[.minecraft]]/saves/<''world name''>/stats/<''[[uuid]]''>.json</samp> (<samp><''world name''>/stats/<''uuid''>.json</samp> on servers). They keep track of these stats. The file structure is JSON based and takes the following format:
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}}: The root tag.
** {{nbt|int|DataVersion}}: The [[data version]] of the game version the file was last saved in.
** {{nbt|compound|stats}}: The tag that stores the actual statistics.
*** {{nbt|compound|<''statisticType''>}}: A compound that saves all statistics of this type.
**** {{nbt|int|<''statisticName''>}}: The value of the statistic specified in this tag's name.
</div>

For example, if a player walked only one block (statistic <code>minecraft.custom:minecraft.walked_one_cm</code>) and broke an oak log (statistic <code>minecraft.mined:minecraft.oak_log</code>), the player's stats would be:

{{#tag:syntaxhighlight|
{
   "stats": {
      "minecraft:mined": {
         "minecraft:oak_log": 1
      },
      "minecraft:custom": {
         "minecraft:walked_one_cm": 100
      }
   },
   "DataVersion": {{data version|Java Edition {{v|java|link=none}}}}
}
|lang=json}}
Statistics are stored in the stats-change section. All of these fields are empty unless they need updating. For example, until the player jumps, the number of times jumped is not recorded. Distance is stored in centimeters (where one block equals 100 centimeters), and time is stored in [[tick]]s (where one tick equals 0.05 seconds).
