'''Combat Test 4''' is the fourth experimental version of a future combat revision.<ref>{{reddit|e3gt34||Since doing something this the last minute on a Friday is a great idea: Combat Test Snapshot Number 4|jeb_|November 30, 2019}}</ref> Although it is a version for a future revision, this combat experiment is a [[wikipedia:Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[Java Edition 1.15 Pre-release 3|1.15 Pre-release 3]]. This version was released only on {{w|Reddit}}, so it does not appear in the [[launcher]] or in any [[Minecraft.net]] blog post. This is the final combat test released in 2019.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* All [[sword]] enchantments can be applied to [[axe]]s in the [[enchanting table]]. 
** This includes the enchantments [[Looting]], [[Sweeping Edge]], [[Knockback]] and [[Fire Aspect]]. Axes could previously only receive [[Sharpness]], [[Smite]] or [[Bane of Arthropods]] through an [[anvil]]. This has been changed so that axes can receive these enchantments naturally in the enchanting table, alongside their exclusive enchantment, [[Cleaving|Chopping]].

'''[[Shield]]s'''
* Added an option to disable shields being activated by pressing {{ctrl|crouch}}.
** Located in the accessibility menu.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
[[File:Shield JE2 BE1.png|width=50x50]]  '''[[Shield]]s'''
* Removed the option to hide the shield.

[[File:Snowball JE3 BE3.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Snowball]]s'''
* Now stack to 64.

[[File:Trident (item).png|width=32x32]] '''[[Trident]]s'''
* Can be shot from [[dispenser]]s.
** [[Channeling]] still works on dispensed tridents.
* Tridents with [[Loyalty]] that fall into the [[void]] return to their owner upon breaking in the void.
* Tridents with [[Impaling]] now deal [[enchantment]] damage to all [[mob]]s that are in [[water]] or [[rain]].

=== Non-mob entities ===
[[File:Arrow JE2 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Arrow]]s'''
* Arrow uncertainty value has been decreased from 1.0 to 0.25. 
** This means fired arrows from [[bow]]s and [[crossbow]]s deviate less from the crosshair, increasing accuracy.

[[File:Snowball JE3 BE3.png|width=32x32]] '''Thrown [[snowball]]s'''
* Now have 4-tick cooldown.
* Not rendered for the first 2 ticks to prevent screen flickering.

[[File:Egg JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''Thrown [[egg]]s'''
* Not rendered for the first 2 ticks to prevent screen flickering.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Combat'''
* The attack timer is now unaffected by switching [[item]]s, only resetting when the [[player]] actually performs an attack. 
* Critical attacks now trigger at 100% attack timer charge.
* Sprint-knockback attacks now trigger at 100% attack timer charge.
* Default attack reach has been decreased from 3 blocks to 2.5 [[block]]s.
* Attacking with a 200% charge now adds +1.0 to the attack reach, up from +0.5.
