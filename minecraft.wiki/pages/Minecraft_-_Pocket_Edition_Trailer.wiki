The '''Minecraft - Pocket Edition Trailer''' is a trailer for [[Pocket Edition|''Pocket Edition'']], produced by the YouTube channel [[Hat Films]]. The trailer is largely live action, and attempts to sell the concept of a touchscreen by emphasizing mobility and thumbs.

== Summary ==
The video begins by showing a pair of "Thumbs". They are said to have a "greater purpose," in the form of playing {{MC}} on {{wikipedia|Android (operating system)|Android}} devices. The trailer then expounds on this, stressing that the game can be played anywhere, in particular the restroom, promising that "you can always Craft!" The video then segues into a short lapse of gameplay, showing an unseen player build a statue of the Android mascot out of [[Wool|lime wool]].

The video ends on a black screen with a logo for the game, as the Android waves.
