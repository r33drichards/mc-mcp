'''Giants''' are [[Java Edition unused features|unused]] over-sized [[hostile mob]]s {{in|java|console}} that resemble [[zombie]]s.

== Drops ==
A giant drops {{xp|5}} [[experience points]] when killed and has a chance of dropping some of its equipment if it has any.

== Spawning == 
No biome includes giants on their spawn lists, so they can never spawn naturally.

Giants also have no [[spawn egg]] in the [[Creative inventory]].

=== Commands ===
Giants can be spawned using [[commands]] such as {{cmd|summon minecraft:giant}}.

== Behavior ==
Giants are close to 12 [[block]]s tall, and they use a six-times-enlarged [[zombie]] model. Giants are not undead mobs. 

Because giants are not actually undead, they do not burn in sunlight and they are damaged by [[potions of Harming]] and healed by [[potions of Healing]], are attacked by the [[wither]], immune to [[Smite]], affected by [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]], and do ''not'' scare [[armadillo]]s. [[Iron golem]]s and [[snow golem]]s attack giants as they attack other hostile [[mob]]s. Giants do not convert into drowned when submerged in water; instead, they slowly suffocate and die. 

Giants currently have no AI. The consequence of this is that they always face south when summoned, and they always stay that way, never wandering. They cannot turn their head, chase the player, or respond to damage. A giant's viewing direction can be changed only with commands or by shoving it into a [[minecart]] that faces a different direction.

Giants can move if ridden by another mob using [[Tutorial:Command NBT tags|NBT tags]].

== Issues ==
Giants are an unsupported mob and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed.

== Trivia ==
* Changes made to the zombie model (for example, using a [[resource pack]]) change the giant's as well.
* [[Notch]] removed the giants spawning capabilities because "they are too overpowered". He did not remove them entirely because "they are just too cool to remove".{{citation needed}}
* Players are unable to attack a giant's head and torso unless they are positioned near the bottom of the giant. Projectiles such as arrows can hit these areas as normal.
* Killing a giant cannot give the [[player]] the Monster Hunter [[advancement]].
* In the April Fools' snapshot [[24w14potato]], giants were overhauled. They have AI and can spawn naturally (during the battle with [[mega spud]] boss). If spawned in the [[Potato dimension]], giants have the skin of Mojang Studios developer [[Jay Wells]].
* If the player uses the command /attribute to set the base scale of a Zombie to 6, It becomes the same size of a Giant.
