'''19w14a''' is the thirty-first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on April 3, 2019<ref name=19w14a>{{snap|19w14a|id=a0|April 3, 2019}}</ref>, which changes player positioning mechanics, allowing players to crawl in 1-block-tall areas.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Now has a new "Sounds" section, listing how many sounds are currently playing near the player out of 247, and streaming sounds ([[jukebox]]es and ingame music) out of 8.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added "It came from space."

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Cat]]s'''
* Now naturally spawn in villages properly instead of only spawning during world generation.

'''[[Pillager]]s'''
* Can no longer open doors.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Nitwits and jobless villagers now bobble their head and grunt if the player tries to trade with them.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Pillager outpost]]s'''
* No longer can spawn inside of [[village]]s.
* Can now be toggled in custom-preset [[superflat]] worlds via "<code>pillager_outpost</code>".

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Instead of [[oak sapling]]s, sticks now generate in the chest of [[savanna]] village houses.

'''[[The Nether]]'''
* [[Soul sand]] and [[gravel]] now generate at [[lava sea]] level, instead of between Y level 60 and 65.<ref>{{bug|MC-152207}} Resolved as "Works As Intended"</ref>

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[Monsters Hunted]]
** No longer requires [[polar bear]]s.
* [[Advancement#Monster Hunter|Monster Hunter]]
** Killing polar bears no longer triggers this advancement.

'''Player positioning'''
* The player's position now adjusts to the gap they are within:
** 1.5 blocks: sneaking posture.
** <1 block: swimming animation.
* Being forced into an area under two blocks high causes the player to adopt the appropriate posture.
