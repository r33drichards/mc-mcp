A '''cave spider''' is a smaller [[spider]] variant that behaves similarly, but has less health and inflicts [[Poison]] with its attacks. They are only spawned by [[spawner]]s in various [[structure]]s.

== Spawning ==
[[File:SpiderSizeComparison.png|thumb|right|Size of a cave spider (left) compared to a regular spider (right).]]
The cave spider is one of the only two mobs in the game to spawn exclusively from spawners, the other being the [[breeze]].

=== Monster spawners ===
Cave spiders spawn from [[monster spawner]]s in [[mineshaft]]s at a [[light]] level of 0. These monster spawners are surrounded by [[cobweb]]s in corridors.

=== Trial spawners ===
Cave spiders have a 25% chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].

=== Spider jockeys ===
{{Main|Spider Jockey}}
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
There is a 1% chance for a cave spider to spawn with a [[skeleton]] riding it, forming a [[Spider Jockey|cave spider jockey]]. The skeleton has an 80% chance to be replaced by a [[stray]], [[bogged]], [[parched]], or [[wither skeleton]] in the biomes where they spawn. Similar to regular spiders, the skeleton controls how both mobs move. Cave spider jockeys can fit through smaller gaps than spider jockeys.

== Drops ==

}}
* {{xp|5}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Cave spiders inherit their behavior from [[spider]]s:
* They are neutral if under daylight or in [[light]] levels of 12 or above, otherwise hostile toward players and [[iron golem]]s. Once they become hostile, light does not affect them.
* They attack by leaping and biting.
* They are unaffected by [[cobweb]]s and [[Poison]].
* They are scared of [[armadillo]]s.

They have some distinctions from regular spiders:
* They can fit through a space that is one [[block]] wide and {{frac|1|2}} block tall.
* They can go through the spaces between two different types of (unconnected) [[fence]]s.
* They cannot spawn with [[status effect]]s in Hard difficulty.{{Only|Java}}
* They flip 90° upon death.{{Only|Bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-41417|||Won't Fix}}</ref>

Being [[arthropod]]s, they are weak against weapons with the [[Bane of Arthropods]] enchantment.

Unlike other neutral mobs, cave spiders don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

The red eyes of cave spiders are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]], making them easily distinguishable in the dark caves where they spawn.

=== Poison ===
On Normal or Hard [[difficulty]], cave spiders inflict {{EffectLink|Poison}} upon attacking.<ref>{{Tweet|jeb|109527533149630465|Your health hearts turn yellowish|September 2, 2011}}</ref> On Normal difficulty, the Poison lasts for 7 seconds and causes {{hp|6|poisoned=1}} damage. On Hard difficulty, it lasts for 15 seconds and causes {{hp|12|poisoned=1}}. Poison damage is not taken when the [[player]]'s health is at {{hp|1}}.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Cave Spider.png|thumb|width=165x165|A cave spider ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride a cave spider that was not spawned as a spider jockey, to form a [[jockey]].

== Trivia ==
* While a cave spider's hitbox is only 13.9% the volume of a normal spider's, its model's volume is 34.3% as large. The shadow is even larger: compared to the normal spider's shadow it has an area of 49%.
