'''Invisible bedrock''' is an [[invisible block]] used to create a [[world boundary]] around [[Old]] worlds and the [[void floor]] {{in|Bedrock}}.

== Appearance ==
Invisible bedrock is fully transparent in rendering and thus is completely invisible.

The texture used for invisible bedrock in the [[inventory]] is that of [[stone]], but it fills the whole slot, unlike stone. If the player lands onto invisible bedrock, [[particles]] from the stone texture can be seen. In ''[[Pi Edition]]'', it used the grass texture instead, as the game is based on an old version of [[Pocket Edition Alpha]] before the texture was changed to stone.

== Obtaining ==
Invisible bedrock can only be obtained through [[add-on]]s or inventory editing.

=== Natural generation ===
One layer of invisible bedrock generates in the void at Y=-105 in the [[Overworld]] and Y=-41 in the [[Nether]] and the [[End]].

Invisible bedrock comprised the border surrounding Old worlds. It did not generate above or below the [[Altitude|height limit]], allowing the [[player]] to travel beyond it by flying over or under it, or by pillaring up and walking over it. This could not be done in [[the Nether]] in Survival mode, because of the [[bedrock]] ceiling.

== Usage ==
The purpose of invisible bedrock is to prevent the player from getting past the border of the world and falling into the [[void]] infinitely. It cannot be targeted; attempting to do so targets anything behind it. The only way to destroy invisible bedrock is by using {{cmd|setblock}} or {{cmd|fill}}.

Invisible bedrock interacts with players and mobs as a solid block and blocks light. Because of this, blocks such as [[torch]]es and [[ladder]]s can be placed on it. The player cannot interact with it; attempting to break an invisible bedrock block instead breaks the block behind it.
