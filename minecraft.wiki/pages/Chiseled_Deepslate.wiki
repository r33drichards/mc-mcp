== Trivia ==
*In [[1.17]], chiseled deepslate was misspelled as "Chiselled Deepslate" in American English.
*Chiseled deepslate depicts a generalized face, with the intent to give the player face pareidolia. <ref>{{tweet|JasperBoerstra|1365326629078188036|Just a face, chiseled blocks dont *have* to have a mob, there is no strict rule on that|February 26, 2021}}</ref>
