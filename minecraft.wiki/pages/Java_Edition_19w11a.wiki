'''19w11a''' is the twenty-fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on March 13, 2019<ref>{{snap|19W11|id=|March 13, 2019}}</ref>, which revamps villager trades. This snapshot marks 1.14 as "for the most part, feature complete".

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Blast Furnace (S) JE1.png; Cauldron JE8.png; Fletching Table JE2 BE1.png; Smithing Table JE2 BE2.png; Smoker (S) JE2.png; Lectern JE2 BE1.png|32px}} [[Blast furnace]]s, [[cauldron]]s, [[fletching table]]s, [[smithing table]]s, [[smoker]]s, [[lectern]]s'''
* Added new sounds.
** Some sounds, like the cauldron, fletching table, and smithing table, are played when villagers are working.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Globe banner pattern.png|16px]] [[Globe banner pattern]]'''
* Obtained by trading with a master-level cartographer villager.

=== Gameplay ===
[[File:Minecraft villager level badges.png|thumb|Villager badge changes color depending on the level of the villager. From left to right: stone (novice), iron (apprentice), gold (journeyman), emerald (expert), and diamond (master).]]

'''[[Trading]]'''
* Added many new villager trades, for each profession.
** Prices now also depend on demand and player's popularity in the village.
* Villagers now resupply their trades up to two times a day, if they get to work at a job site block.
* Updated the trading UI.
* Villagers now level up from gaining experience by trading with a player.
** They have 5 levels: novice, apprentice, journeyman, expert, and master.
** A little experience bar is shown at the top of the trading UI. Once the bar fills up from trading, exiting the UI and waiting briefly levels up the villager and shows pink particles, similar to those shown when refreshing trades in previous versions of the game.
** Experience that exceeds the level up amount seems to roll over between level ups.
** The experience bar disappears once the villager becomes master level.
** Every time a new level is reached, 1-2 new trade offers appear.
** The villager's experience gained per trade is based on the trade itself, the level the trade was unlocked at (novice, apprentice, etc), and the current level of the villager.
*** Lower level trades give less experience toward a level up once the villager is a higher level.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added a new "accessibility menu".
** All accessibility features are now easily toggled in this menu.
* When the narrator is turned on, buttons are narrated on focus.
* Added a new option that allows turning up transparent backgrounds.
* Menu buttons, edit boxes and other UI elements can now be cycled through by pressing {{key|Tab}}.
** {{key|Shift+Tab}} goes backwards.
* Lists allow {{key|Up}} and {{key|Down}} arrow keys to navigate through them.

'''Block tags'''
* Added several new block tags to correspond with villager NBT:
** <code>points_of_interest</code> (includes two tags below)
** <code>meeting_site_poi</code>
** <code>job_site_poi</code> (includes all below)
*** <code>armorer_poi</code>
*** <code>butcher_poi</code>
*** <code>cartographer_poi</code>
*** <code>cleric_poi</code>
*** <code>farmer_poi</code>
*** <code>fisherman_poi</code>
*** <code>fletcher_poi</code>
*** <code>leatherworker_poi</code>

*** <code>shepherd_poi</code>
*** <code>toolsmith_poi</code>
*** <code>weaponsmith_poi</code>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bell]]s'''
* Now rings when hit by an [[arrow]].

'''[[Cartography table]]s'''
* Now requires four planks to be crafted instead of two.

'''[[Crops]]'''
* The block that needs to be lit up for pumpkin and melon growth has been moved from above the stem to being the stem block itself.

'''[[Fletching table]]s'''
* Can be now crafted with 4 [[planks]] and 2 [[flint]].
* [[Villager]]s use them as a job site.

'''[[Smithing table]]s'''
* Can now be crafted with 4 [[planks]] and 2 [[iron ingot]]s.
* [[Villager]]s use them as a job site.

'''[[TNT]]'''
* Explosions now have a 100% drop rate.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Parrot]]s'''
* Can now imitate [[pillager]]s, [[ravager]]s and [[panda]]s.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now have a daily schedule.
** Each villager tries to find their own bed and job site block.
** Each profession has a specific block that works as a job site for them.
** A full list of job site blocks and their corresponding villagers below:
*** Armorer: {{BlockLink|blast furnace}}
*** Butcher: {{BlockLink|smoker}}
*** Cartographer: {{BlockLink|cartography table}} 
*** Cleric: {{BlockLink|brewing stand}}
*** Farmer: {{BlockLink|composter}}
*** Fisherman: {{BlockLink|barrel}}
*** Fletcher: {{BlockLink|fletching table}}
*** Leatherworker: {{BlockLink|cauldron}}
*** Librarian: {{BlockLink|lectern}}
*** Mason: {{BlockLink|stonecutter}}
*** Shepherd: {{BlockLink|loom}}
*** Toolsmith: {{BlockLink|smithing table}}
*** Weaponsmith: {{BlockLink|grindstone}}
* [[Iron golem]]s spawn when enough villagers meet.
* All villagers spawn as nitwits (green robes) or unemployed (brown robes) when spawned by [[spawn egg]] or commands.
** Unemployed villagers have no initial profession, but can change to one by finding a job site block.
* Villagers now show players their trades in their hands if the player is holding certain items which they trade for.
* Mason villagers now have trades.

'''[[Wolves]]'''
* Tamed wolf kills now count as player kills. 
** E.g a [[zombie]] can rarely drop a [[potato]] on death alongside its normal drops, and an [[illager captain]] inflicts [[Bad Omen]] on death when killed by the wolf.
** Before, tamed wolves only had mobs drop xp and their common drops upon death.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart with TNT]]'''
* Explosions now have a 100% drop rate.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Village]]s'''
* Village detection is now based on beds, job sites and meeting points instead of doors.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[A Balanced Diet]]
** Now also requires [[suspicious stew]] and [[sweet berries]].
* [[Who's the Pillager Now?]]
** Now only triggered by [[crossbow]]s.

=== General ===
'''Language'''
* Now changes the language after clicking on the 'Done' button to avoid having to wait after accidentally clicking an unwanted language option.
** Before, language changed immediately after choosing a different language option.

'''Snooper settings'''
* Has been removed from [[options]]. However, the setting is still configurable outside the game in [[options.txt]].

'''Data format'''
* The "poi" folder has been added and village data is now stored in it.
