'''Wool''' is a block obtained from [[sheep]] that can be [[dye]]d in any of the sixteen different [[Dyeing|colors]]. It can be used as a crafting material and to block [[Sculk Sensor#Vibration detection|vibrations]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Wool can be broken using any [[tool]], but [[shears]] are the fastest tool to use.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Wool|shears=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
; Woodland Mansion
All wool colours (except magenta, pink, and purple) generate naturally as part of structures within [[woodland mansion]]s.

; Village
White and yellow wool generate in shepherd houses, fletcher houses, and meeting points in [[plains]] [[village]]s.

10 light gray wool generate under the [[door]] and on the floor of ''Snowy_small_house_8'' in [[snowy tundra]] villages.

; Pillager outpost
White wool generates as tents outside [[pillager outpost]]s.

; Ancient city
Gray wool appears on some walls and on the floors of long corridors at the corners of an [[ancient city]]. The wool damps vibrations, preventing activation of nearby sculk blocks. Ancient cities can also generate blue, cyan, and light blue wool.

=== Mob loot ===
{{control|use|text=Using}} [[shears]] on an adult [[sheep]] yields 1&ndash;3 wool. Sheep also drop 1 wool upon death, if they are not sheared. The wool dropped is the same color as the sheep, unless the sheep is named '''jeb_''', in which case the sheep drops whatever color the sheep truly is instead of rainbow wool. The drop rates are not affected by the [[Fortune]] or [[Looting]] [[enchantment]]s. Baby sheep cannot be sheared.

Sheep can spawn with different colors. The most common color is determined by the type of [[biome]] the sheep spawns in. In temperate biomes the most common color is white, in cold biomes it is black and in warm biomes it is brown. However sheep can spawn in all three of these colors, and light and dark grey, in all biomes. Sheep can also naturally spawn with pink wool but this has a rare chance.<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-70-bedrock-changelog</ref>

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources|Any color Wool}}

=== Villager gifts ===
{{IN|Java}}, a shepherd [[villager]] may throw a block of wool of random color at a player under the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.

== Usage ==
Wool comes in sixteen colours, which are white, light gray, gray, black, brown, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, cyan, light blue, blue, purple, magenta, and pink. Unlike [[stained glass]] and [[terracotta]], the white variant serves as the undyed block. Wool of any color can be re-dyed into any other color.

Wool is easily mined, highly flammable, and offers little resistance against [[explosion]]s.  

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses|White Wool|Brown Wool|Black Wool|Gray Wool}}

=== Vibration occlusion ===
Wool can be used to block [[vibration]]s from reaching nearby [[sculk sensor]]s. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect vibrations behind it. Similarly, if a wool block is placed between a sensor and a [[sculk shrieker]], the sensor is unable to alert the shrieker. 

Sculk sensors are not able to detect the placing and breaking of wool, as well as entities [[walking]], [[sprinting]], or [[jumping]] on top of it. They are also unable to detect [[Item (entity)|items]] dropped on wool, or wool itself dropped in item form.

Similar to sculk sensors, [[warden]]s are also unable to detect everything wool-related as listed above.

Wool can also be used to block [[Note Block|note block]] sounds from reaching [[Allay|allays]].

=== Note blocks ===
Wool blocks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "guitar" sounds.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Any color of wool or wood can be used for paintings but it has no effect on the product's final appearance.

{{crafting usage|Any Wool}}

=== Fuel ===
{{IN|Java}}, wool can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s and [[Furnace (disambiguation)|their variants]], smelting 0.5 items per wool block.
