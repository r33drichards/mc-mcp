'''Bedrock''' is an [[indestructible]] block found in all three [[dimension]]s.

== Obtaining ==
Bedrock can be obtained only from the [[Creative inventory]], using {{control|pick block}} in [[Creative]] mode, or [[commands]].

=== Breaking ===
{{relevant tutorial|Breaking bedrock}}
Bedrock can't be destroyed by breaking.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Bedrock|none|foot=1}}
Bedrock drops nothing when destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Bedrock comprises the five bottommost layers of the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]] in a rough pattern, although the top four layers are predominantly flat bedrock with only rare gaps, rendering the lowest, completely flat fifth layer (at Y=-64) mostly inaccessible. The distribution of bedrock is dependent on the [[world seed]]. {{only|JE|short=1}}

In the Nether, bedrock additionally comprises the top five layers in a rough pattern. At the top of the Nether (Y=127), the layer is composed solely of bedrock, preventing the player from ascending above Y=127 without switching their gamemode to [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]], or exploiting glitches. The patterns of bedrock are consistent in the Nether {{in|Java|Bedrock}}.

In [[the End]], a single block of bedrock generates on top of each [[End spike]], each topped with an [[End crystal]]. The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally composes part of the [[exit portal]] at the center of the [[central island]]. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the [[void]] without exploiting glitches.

An unlimited number of [[End gateway]]s generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock and an [[End gateway block]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
If the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the [[ender dragon]] is defeated or re-summoned. 

An End gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each ender dragon, which is mostly made of bedrock. A total of 20 of these gateways generate in a circle centered on the exit portal in set positions. A corresponding End gateway is generated in the inner edge of the [[outer islands]] after an End gateway on the central island is activated for the first time.

== Usage ==
Bedrock generates at the bottom of the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]] to prevent [[entities]] from falling into the [[void]] in these dimensions. 

The bedrock ceiling in the Nether prevents [[player]]s from accessing the [[Nether roof]], which is meant to be an empty out-of-bounds area. 

Bedrock generates as part of End gateways, [[end spike]]s tops and End exit portals to prevent those parts of the structures from being broken.

[[Mob]]s do not spawn on bedrock. [[Endermen]] are unable to place the block they are holding onto bedrock.

[[Beacon]]s treat bedrock as a transparent block, meaning their beams can pass through it, allowing beacons to be used in the Nether.

In the End, any [[fire]] on bedrock never extinguishes naturally, similar to [[netherrack]], but does not spread.

=== Trapping the wither ===
{{main|Tutorial:Wither cage}}
Since bedrock is indestructible in Survival, it can be used against [[wither]]s. Certain configurations of bedrock (such as that found under the exit portal) can be used to securely trap withers by spawning them below the bedrock. The wither can then be easily killed, utilized to break blocks automatically, or used to farm [[wither rose]]s.

=== End crystal ===
Bedrock is one of the only two blocks on which [[End crystal]]s can be placed, the other being [[obsidian]]. Placing four End crystals on bedrock around the exit portals triggers respawning the [[ender dragon]].

Placing an End crystal on bedrock in the End sets it on fire.

=== Note blocks ===
[[Note block]]s can be placed above bedrock to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Bedrock is unable to be pushed or pulled by either of the [[piston]] variants (regular or sticky).

== Trivia ==
* Outside of ''[[Minecraft]]'', "{{w|bedrock|newtab=1}}" means any solid rock beneath the soil layer (i.e. anything below dirt, sand, gravel. etc.). In real life, bedrock is breakable.
* [[Stronghold]]s and the End portal can override generated bedrock.
* The bedrock texture, in both the Default and Programmer Art [[resource pack]]s, is a variant of the [[stone]] block with increased contrast.
* [[Vex]]es and the [[ender dragon]] can fly through bedrock. Additionally, the ender dragon cannot break bedrock.
