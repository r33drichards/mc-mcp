'''Bedrock Editor v0.8.7''' is a minor beta release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on February 5, 2025, which adds some technical things and fixes bugs.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/220</ref><ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/34063162910093</ref>

== Additions ==
* Added Block Inspector tool which allows you to view block states and permutations of blocks.
* Added Entity Inspector tool which allows you to view and modify entity components.
* Added a new {{cd|IRootPropertyPane.createModalOverlayPane}} API function, allowing the creation of {{cd|IModalOverlayPane}} to display on top of the pane content. Each pane supports one active modal overlay at a time, but it can own multiple modals. Modal overlays can be managed through the root pane's {{cd|setActiveModalOverlay}} function or the overlay pane's show and hide functions.

== Fixes ==
* Fixed an assert encountered on client disconnect from dedicated server and re-entry into a world.
** Fixed block picker UI dialog persisting after a client disconnect from a dedicated server.
