[[File:Multiplayer_preview.png|thumb|From left to right: [[Kai]], [[Steve]], [[Efe]], and [[Zuri]] playing together.]]
'''Multiplayer''' is the style of playing ''[[Minecraft]]'' that involves multiple [[player]]s interacting on a single [[world]] hosted by a player or an external [[server]], allowing them to work together to mine [[ores]], build structures, and fight [[mobs]] (or [[PvP|each other]]), or to simply play together.

== Gameplay ==
{{See also|Server#Archetypes}}
The [[gameplay]] of a multiplayer game still retains the same structure as the singleplayer counterpart. Take for example, in a [[Survival]] multiplayer game, players advance by gathering [[resource]]s, fighting [[monster]]s, exploring the [[world]], and reaching [[the End]]. However, multiplayer puts more emphasis on collaboration between players. Tasks such as resource gathering, [[farming]], and building [[structure]]s can be divided among players, making progression much faster compared to a singleplayer game.

Multiplayer allows for [[player]]-driven activities beyond the main game objectives. Players often establish [[w:Virtual economy|in-game economy]] by building shops to trade valuable resources like [[diamond]]s and [[enchanted]] items. They can also engage in elaborate building for their homes and structures, such as {{w|house}}s, {{w|bridge}}s, {{w|castle}}s, {{w|pixel art}}s, {{w|statue}}s, and more &ndash; usually forming into {{w|town}}s or {{w|cities}}.

Multiplayer games can also deviate from the base game experience; competitive games like [[player versus player]] (PvP) and many [[Server#Minigame|minigame]]s are heavily community-based. In addition, most custom adventure [[World|map]]s are also playable in multiplayer. These activities often rely on the [[chat]] system for communication between players, which can be managed on the [[Social interactions]] screen.

=== Differences from singleplayer ===
The game runs an internal [[server]] for singleplayer mode, allowing for better parity between the multiplayer and singleplayer experience. However, there are still some differences between a multiplayer and singleplayer game, one being that the game cannot be [[pause]]d by a player.

Opening the pause menu in multiplayer does not pause the game. For example, if the player has items being [[smelt]]ed in a furnace, pressing the pause button ({{key|Esc}} by default) does not stop the smelting process. [[Mob]]s and entities don't pause and continue to work regardless, and even attacking the player. Although, in {{JE}}, server [[operator]]s can simulate pausing by using {{cmd|tick freeze}} command. In this state, non-player characters and interactions such as [[physics]], [[Daylight cycle|daylight]] and [[weather]] cycle, [[mob AI]] and movements, item [[smelting]], certain [[animation]]s, and other [[Tick#Game process|actions]] are frozen. Players and player-ridden entities are still able to continue play, regardless if they are operator status or not.

In multiplayer mode, the [[locator bar]] is enabled and keeps track of other players' waypoints. This is absent in singleplayer, though {{in|JE}}, it can be enabled manually for tracking [[entities]] using {{cmd|waypoint}} command and {{attr|waypoint_transmit_range}} attribute.

{{see also|Tutorial:Setting up a LAN world}}
===''Java Edition''===
[[File:Open to LAN.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Settings for a multiplayer game on local area network (LAN).]]
{{IN|JE}}, singleplayer worlds can be hosted as multiplayer games on the {{w|local area network}} (LAN), usually connected by {{w|Wi-Fi}} or {{w|Router (computing)|router}}. LAN is not enabled by default, and must be activated on "Open to LAN" menu under the [[pause menu]]. Upon activation, the multiplayer game provides additional settings:
* "Game Mode", which sets the [[game mode]] of other players once they join the world for the first time. Once a player rejoins, they retain their previous game mode even if the game mode on join was changed. 
* "Allow Commands", which allows or denies other players access to execute [[command]]s depending on the selected option. Once a player rejoins, they do not retain their cheats permissions unless enabled again.
* "Port Number", which specifies the port number for the LAN-based server. If not specified, the game randomizes the server port. The port is automatically shown on the chat when the LAN game is activated.

Players can also open their game to LAN by using {{cmd|publish}} command, which provide arguments to configure the same settings.

Once published, the host's game sends a UDP multicast to the {{w|multicast address}} <code>224.0.2.60:4445</code> every 1.5 seconds, notifying other players of the host's presence, and making their LAN world pop up automatically in the [[server list]].

===''Bedrock Edition''===
[[File:Ore UI - Create New World Screen Menu "Multiplayer" Tab Settings (Bedrock).png|thumbnail|right|380px|"Multiplayer" section of [[Create New World#Multiplayer|Create New World]] or [[Edit World#Multiplayer|Edit World]] which lets player customize their multiplayer game.]]
{{IN|BE}}, the game features multiplayer connections using local area network (LAN) and the {{w|Xbox network}}. When signed in with a Microsoft account and connected to the internet, the host can let players join their game by invites or their friend status in the Xbox network. Multiplayer game is enabled by default upon a [[world creation]], which can be changed in the [[edit world]] screen.

The multiplayer game visibility in the Xbox network can be changed in {{UI|Edit World|Multiplayer|Player access}}, which provides following options:

* "Invited players", which allows some Xbox friends that the host invites to join.
* "Friends", which allows any Xbox friends of the host to join them. This is the default option.
* "Friends of friends", which allows the host's Xbox friends and their friends to join them.

A friend's multiplayer game in the Xbox network appears on the "Worlds" tab of the [[play]] screen, showing the world name and amount of active players. Individual players can also be joined through the [[Friends sidebar|social drawer]] or the player's [[profile screen]]. Friends can be invited to a world with the "Invite to play" button in the social drawer in the [[pause menu]], who will get a notification (even when not in-game), and the option to join the world.

The host can set specific [[permissions]] for each player in the game. By default, a player upon joining gets "Member" role, which enables mining, building, and interacting with the world and entities. This can be set in the multiplayer settings, which provides "Visitor" and "Operator" roles, and further more on the player permissions screen in the pause menu, which provides more granular and custom permissions. The host can also kick active players from the multiplayer world, or ban them to hide the world for them.

The "Visible to LAN Players" option allows anyone (except Nintendo Switch players) on the same local network (either by {{w|Wi-Fi hotspot}} or [[w:Router (computing)|router]]) as the host to join them, regardless if they are an Xbox friend of the host or not, and does not require any internet connection.

On console versions, playing a multiplayer game requires an online subscription of either {{w|Xbox Game Pass}}, {{w|Nintendo Switch Online}}, or {{w|PlayStation Plus}}.<ref>{{cite|title=How to Join a Friend’s Online World in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition|website=Minecraft Help Center|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/24122512131213}}</ref> This includes joining a LAN multiplayer game; hosting it however, does not.

There can be a maximum of 5 or 8 players at a time in a world, depending on the host's system, and can be set using {{cmd|setmaxplayers}} up to 40 players.

}}
[[Server]]s allow players to host a ''Minecraft'' world outside the normal [[Client software|game itself]]. In order to join a ''Minecraft'' server, the game includes a menu where players can join a server, and save the ones they've visited. This feature is called the '''server list''', and it's available inside the Multiplayer menu,{{only|JE|short=1}} or the Servers tab on the [[Play menu]].{{only|BE|short=1}} From the list, players can check if a server is online, check their {{w|Ping (video games)|ping time}} to the server, and see how many players are in the game. {{IN|BE}}, the server list includes [[featured servers]] which are partnered with [[Mojang Studios]]. In the console versions, the featured servers are the only servers available to the players, and external servers cannot be added or accessed.

Worlds hosted on servers can also be joined through LAN play as described above.

The [[Official Minecraft Server List]] by GamerSafer and Mojang features a variety of servers for the player to choose, which are categorized into options such as [[minigame]]s, [[SMP]]s, and [[creative]] builds.<!-- Copy from [[Official Minecraft Server List#Servers]] --> All servers listed on the website are required to comply with [https://aka.ms/MCUsageGuidelines Minecraft Usage Guidelines] (MUG) and [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula End-user license agreement] (EULA), and have been vetted by both GamerSafer and the [https://x.com/IP_Justice Mojang Enforcement Team].<!-- Copy from [[Server list#Official Minecraft Server List]] -->

== Realms ==
{{Main|Realms}}
Players can pay a subscription service to create their own private ''Minecraft'' server which is always online. This service is called ''Realms'', and it is provided by [[Mojang Studios]] on {{els|je|be}}. Realms are not available in the server list, players can join Realms only if they're invited by the Realm owner. Realms provides several exclusive features included in the subscription.

== Player list ==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
Players can see a list of players in the server by holding down {{key|Tab}} key, which is [[Controls|bound]] to List Players by default. For each player, the face part of their [[skin]] is shown alongside their [[username]], and on the right, a network bar indicator that shows how good the player's connection to the server; when more green bar is filled in the indicator, the lower [[w:Lag_(video_games)#Ping_time|ping time]] the player has. If a scoreboard objective is set to the {{cd|list}} [[Scoreboard#Display_slots|display slot]], the player's score for that objective is shown to the left of the network indicator.

{| class="wikitable pixel-image"
|+ Meaning of ping icons<ref>The player list implementation can be seen on {{jcp|net.minecraft.client.gui.components.PlayerTabOverlay}} class in the game's code. ([[Obfuscation map|Mojang mapping]])</ref>
|-
! Icon !! Player's ping time
|-
| [[File:ping_unknown.png|20px]] || Below 0ms{{Note|Unlikely to ever happen. The game's code does not have any case where the ping (or latency) is set to less than zero.}}
|-
| [[File:ping_5.png|20px]] || Between 0 and 150ms

| [[File:ping_4.png|20px]] || Between 150 and 300ms

|-
| [[File:ping_1.png|20px]] || Above 1000ms
|}

The ping time (or latency) is calculated by {{math|(previous latency * 3 + client round trip time) / 4}}, which the ''client round trip time'' is calculated from subtracting the current system time by milliseconds with the [[Java Edition protocol/Packets#Clientbound Keep Alive (configuration)|client keep alive time]].<ref>The calculation can be checked on {{jcp|net.minecraft.server.network.ServerCommonPacketListenerImpl#handleKeepAlive()}} method. (Mojang mapping)</ref> If no previous latency is set, then the initial latency is zero.

{{notelist}}

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Online players in the server can be seen in the [[pause menu]]. Each player is shown with their [[player permission]], and their Xbox profile picture next to the username; otherwise, it shows a LAN icon indicating they are not signed in to Microsoft account. If a scoreboard objective is set to the {{cd|list}} [[Scoreboard#Display_slots|display slot]], the player's score for that objective is shown here.
