'''Big''' is a joke [[effect]] that increases the size of entities, added in [[23w13a_or_b]].

It is the counterpart to [[Small]].

== Effect ==
The size of entities (both visual size and its [[hitbox]]) are multiplied by ''level''+1. Mob [[drops]] are also multiplied: there are (''level''+1)<sup>3</sup> rolls performed on a mob under this effect. This means, for example, that an [[evoker]] with Big I always drops 8 [[totems of undying]], calculated from (1+1)<sup>3</sup>, as there is a 100% chance to drop the totem on each roll. This evoker also drops anywhere from 0 to 8 [[emerald]]s, most likely 4, as there is a 50% chance to drop an emerald on each roll.
