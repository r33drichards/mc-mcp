'''''Nuke the Dinosaurs Blueprint Prototype''''', also known as just '''''Nuke the Dinosaurs''''', is a pinball game made by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Bundle Mojam 2]].

== Gameplay ==

After starting the game, the player can launch a ball, and trigger the two paddles to launch the ball into air. Hitting various elements of the table awards different amounts of points.

If the ball falls off the table, it is lost. During one game, the player can use up three balls, losing all of them leads to the game ending.

=== Controls ===

The game is played with a keyboard.

* {{Key|1}}: Start game
* {{Key|Space}}: Launch ball/restart lost game
* Left {{Key|Ctrl}}: Trigger left paddle
* Right {{Key|Ctrl}}: Trigger right paddle

== Trivia ==

* As the name suggests, this is technically a prototype and not the full game, however the full game is not known to have been ever released.
* The JAR of the game contains a <code>test.png</code> file, which teased the inclusion of [[hay bale]]s in Minecraft.
