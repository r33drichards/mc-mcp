A '''cake''' is both a [[food]] and a [[block]]. It can be eaten by placing and {{Control|use|text=using}} it, with each use consuming one of its seven slices.

A '''cake with candle''' is an uneaten cake with any type of [[candle]] placed on it, which can be lit with a [[flint and steel]] to emit [[light]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Once the cake is placed, it cannot be recollected even with the use of [[Silk Touch]], meaning placing it is final. Cakes with [[candle]]s always drop their respective candle when broken.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management}}
[[File:Eating Cake Demo.png|thumb|[[Sunny]] and [[Alex]] eating a cake together.]]
Unlike most [[food]], the cake cannot be eaten as an [[item]] in the hotbar. Before being eaten, it must first be placed on top of a solid [[block]]. Placing the cake on a slab also works, as the slab acts like a solid block. The cake instead floats half a block on top of the slab.

Each cake has seven "slices"; each use consumes one slice progressing inward from the west. A single slice restores {{hunger|2}} hunger and 0.4 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]]. Eating all seven slices of a cake restores {{hunger|14}} hunger and 2.8 hunger saturation.

Since eating a cake comes with no animation, the cake can be eaten at a rate of one slice per [[tick]]. Multiple [[player]]s can eat from the same cake at the same time. {{IN|java}}, eating cake makes no [[sound]], unlike other foods.

As a [[redstone]] component, when connected to a [[comparator]], a whole cake emits a signal strength of 14. The signal strength decreases two units with each slice.

Cake destroys [[Entity#Gravity-affected blocks|falling blocks]] if placed under them, similar to a [[torch]]. A player who is [[sneaking]] can place any block (including a cake or a falling block) on top of a cake without the block breaking.

=== Pandas ===
Some [[panda]]s move toward a dropped cake to pick up and eat it. Some may not, depending on the cake's location. Cake cannot be used to breed pandas. 

=== Composting ===
Placing a cake into a [[composter]] raises the compost level by 1.

=== Piston interactivity ===
A cake is broken when pushed by a [[piston]], and it drops nothing.

=== Cakes with candles ===
[[File:Cake with Candle.png|thumb|upright|A cake with candle created by placing a candle on an uneaten cake.]]
{{control|Using}} a [[candle]] on an uneaten cake creates a cake with candle of that color (including uncolored). Eating any of the cake causes the candle to drop. 

{{control|Using}} [[flint and steel]], [[fire charge]], or any flaming projectile on an unlit cake with candle lights its candle. Lit cakes with candles emit a [[light level]] of 3 and [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] of {{Color|#d3852b}} when the "Render Dragon Features for Creators" [[experiment]] is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''. {{control|Interacting}} with the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it.

Lit candled cakes emit the same [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] as [[candle]]s.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
=== Interaction ===
* Because cake is only {{frac|7|8}} blocks wide, it is possible to stand on the edge of a [[block]] beneath a cake. This makes it possible to create a functioning staircase using cakes placed on a ramp of 1×1 blocks.
* It is possible to place cake on top of another cake by placing a cake on the ground, then placing another cake on the side of a block above and to the side of the first cake, similar to placing [[torch]]es on a [[chest]]. Eating the lower cake causes the upper cake to disappear, as does mining out the block of cake it is sitting on.
* [[Mob]]s on top of cakes rotate while attempting to move, a pathfinding oversight shared with [[fence]]s.
* If cake is placed in a hole one block deep, players can get across the hole without jumping, although a player standing on the cake must jump to get out of the hole.

=== Miscellaneous ===
[[File:IOTY.png|thumb|100px|The 2010 Indie of the Year Awards logo.]]
* Cake was added to ''[[Minecraft]]'' following the ModDB [[2010 Indie of the Year Awards]]. [[Notch]] agreed to add cake to ''Minecraft'' if it won, which led to a campaign called "The Quest For Cake". ''Minecraft'' won 3 of the 7 awards, including the "Indie of the Year" award.
* The player can place cake on top of a [[bed]], and while [[sleeping]], the cake shows on the player's screen as if it were on top of their head.
* The name of the achievement for crafting a cake is a reference to the internet meme "The Cake is a Lie", which originated from [[wikipedia:Valve Corporation|Valve Software's]] game, ''[[wikipedia:Portal (video game)#Plot|Portal]]''.
* On May 17, 2019, for the [[10th Anniversary|10th anniversary]] of ''Minecraft'', the cake [[model]] was changed to display a "10" above it, made of [[white concrete]].
* Unlike most foods, cakes don't count towards the advancement "[[A Balanced Diet]]" {{in|java}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-117561||Cake not counting in 'A Balanced Diet' advancement}}</ref>
