=== Mobs ===
'''General'''

'''[[File:Steve JE3 BE1.png|40px]] [[Monster (entity)|Monster]]'''
* Now has a model.

== Removals ==
=== World generation ===
* Big [[tree]]s no longer generate.

== Bugs ==
* Placing doors on farmland causes the bottom part of the door to disappear and the door is now unable to be interacted with.
* Placing a door in a 1 block tall space causes the door to delete the block occupying the topmost door space.
* Placing doors on [[glass]], [[slab]]s, ladders, and signs cause the doors to immediately break and drop two doors, allowing for door duplication.
* Trees can grow into the top door block, causing only a bottom half door to remain. 
* While mining signs, they give out [[grass block]] particles.
* When placing a sign, it is rotated by 1 increment more than supposed to.
* Placing two non-opaque blocks (ex. glass, slabs) next to each other and placing a sign on top of each causes the signs to break, the game to crash, and the player will be left with a 0-stacked sign in the inventory which can then be duplicated. 
* Placing ladders on any non-solid block makes ladders invisible. The ladders will have same data value as the last "correctly" placed ladder. Upon reloading the world they will take up the space of a full block and are unable to be climbed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfHYswCsv98</ref>
* Jumping in water may crash the game.
