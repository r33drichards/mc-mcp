The '''Home Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out as a promotion for ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', alongside the [[Menace Cape]] and the [[Yearn Cape]].

== Appearance ==
The cape's design depicts the {{AMCM|Earth portal}}, as shown in ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', with a grass base and a bright blue backdrop.

The elytra design depicts the movie's version of {{AMCM|Steve}}, as portrayed by [[Jack Black]].

== Distribution ==
Players could receive this cape by [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem#movie-cape redeeming a code], which could be obtained by watching any ''Minecraft'' livestream on [[Twitch]] for three minutes. This could be done between March 18, 2025 and April 6, 2025.
