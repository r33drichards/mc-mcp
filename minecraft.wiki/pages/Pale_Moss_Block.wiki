A '''pale moss block''' is a block that generates in [[pale garden]]s. Unlike [[moss block]]s, pale moss blocks are flammable.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Pale moss blocks can be mined using any tool or by hand, but a [[hoe]] is the quickest way to break it.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Pale Moss Block|link=none|Hoe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Pale moss blocks can be found on [[Pale moss patch|pale moss patches]] inside of [[pale garden]]s.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 2 pale moss blocks for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
When [[bone meal]] is {{control|used}} on a pale moss block, moss spreads to any of the blocks listed below, if they have [[air]] blocks above them, in a corner-less 7×11×7 volume centered on the original pale moss block. Foliage can replace air on any of these blocks.

The following blocks can be replaced with pale moss blocks:

* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate}}
* {{BlockLink|Diorite}}

When a pale moss block generates, it has a chance to have [[short grass]], [[tall grass]], or a [[pale moss carpet]] growing on it.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Bone meal on pale moss blocks
!Block!!Chance
|-
|{{BlockLink|Short Grass}}||58.82%
|-
|{{BlockLink|Pale Moss Carpet}}||29.41%
|-
|{{BlockLink|Tall Grass}}||11.76%
|}

== Usage ==
Most plants can be placed on pale moss except for [[cacti]]. [[Small Dripleaf|Small dripleaves]] can be placed on pale moss, but only [[water|underwater]]. [[Big dripleaves]] cannot be placed on pale moss. [[Nether fungi]] can also be placed on it, while [[mushroom]]s can be placed only at light level 12 or below. Mushrooms placed on pale moss can be grown into [[huge mushroom]]s.

Unlike regular moss blocks, pale moss blocks cannot be used to increase the hatching speed of [[sniffer egg]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a pale moss block into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Pale moss blocks are destroyed and dropped as [[item (entity)|items]] when pushed by [[piston]]s. They do not stick to [[sticky piston]]s, [[slime block]]s, or [[honey block]]s.
