'''1.4.0''',<ref>{{link|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360004203351-Minecraft-1-4-0-Bedrock-|title=Minecraft - 1.4.0 (Bedrock)}}</ref> also known as ''Phase One'' of the '''[[Update Aquatic]]''', is a major update to {{el|be}} released on May 16, 2018.<ref name=OutNow/> It adds many new features focused primarily around ocean-related content, such as [[dolphin]]s, [[shipwreck]]s, [[fish]], [[trident]]s, [[buried treasure]], and many other changes and fixes. Improvements to the technical aspect of the game were also added in this update, as well as an option to toggle various features from {{el|ee}} into worlds. 

Because of the vast amount of content to be added in Update Aquatic in Bedrock Edition, it was later decided to split the update into two major updates, with things like [[turtle]]s, [[conduit]]s and [[bubble column]]s being pushed back to Phase Two ([[Bedrock Edition 1.5.0|1.5.0]]). Non-aquatic features from the Java version of Update Aquatic (such as [[phantom]]s and the [[Slow Falling]] status effect) were also postponed to [[Bedrock Edition 1.6.0|1.6.0]].

==Trivia==
*Originally, this update was going to be released as '''1.3.0''', however that number was skipped because of various technical reasons relating to version numbering on certain platforms.{{cn}}
*This update was known for having strange version labeling during the beta, as no such beta version under the name "beta 1.3.0.x" or "beta 1.4.0.x" was released. Instead, multiple betas were released under the names of versions that were released later on, making a sort of "pseudo-beta":
**[[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.13.8|Beta 1.2.13.8]] to [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.13.12|1.2.13.12]] included additions through Experimental Gameplay, which made it into the official [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.13|1.2.13]] release.
**[[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.14.2|Beta 1.2.14.2]] and [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.14.3|1.2.14.3]] added features in the world generation, but this did not make it into the full [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.14|1.2.14]] release on iOS, which was completely different from the labeled beta version.
**[[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.20.1|Beta 1.2.20.1]] and [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.20.2|1.2.20.2]] added more features, but was labeled under a version named "1.2.20", which was never released. Instead, this was merged into the full 1.4.0 release.
