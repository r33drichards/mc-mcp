A '''bat''' is a flying ambient<ref name="bats">{{mcnet|meet-bat|Meet the Bat|March 7, 2017|Tom Stone}}</ref> [[passive mob]] that spawns in dark areas.

== Spawning ==

Bats can [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in groups of 8{{Only|Java|short=JE}} or 2{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} in the [[Overworld]] at a light level of 3 or less at any y-level, on blocks of [[stone]], [[granite]], [[diorite]], [[andesite]], [[tuff]], or [[deepslate]] that are not directly exposed to the sky. They also need at least 1.5 air blocks (with for instance, a top [[trapdoor]] or top [[slab]] in the block above foot level). They can spawn in any [[Overworld]] biome except the [[deep dark]].

Bat entities do not count toward the passive [[Mob spawning#Java Edition mob cap|mob cap]], as they are said to be ambient<ref name="bats" /> creatures, and therefore fall into the dedicated ambient category.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Bats do not drop any [[item]]s or [[experience]] upon death.

== Behavior ==
Bats often fly around aimlessly, squeaking randomly. Their flight pattern tends to favor the east, and sometimes they may fly into [[lava]] and catch on [[fire]].<ref>{{bug|MC-194|||WAI}}</ref>

Bats hang upside down on the underside of a [[solid block]] when idle, though they cannot hang on transparent or non-solid blocks. During this state, they squeak far less and occasionally turn to face different directions. They remain in this state until they are disturbed; if a player approaches a bat hanging upside down, even if the player is invisible, it flies away. This also happens if the player breaks the block the bat is hanging from. 

Bats [[despawn]] when over 32 blocks away from the player.

Bats' collision boxes do not interact with the player or [[redstone components]]{{only|java}}.

Bats cannot be transported by conventional means. A [[lead]] cannot be attached to a bat, and it cannot be put in a [[minecart]] or [[boat]].

Bats can also get caught in and slowed by [[cobweb]]s.

Bats cannot [[breed]], and baby bats do not exist.

== Trivia == 

*According to [[Jens Bergensten]], the bat is an example of an ambient mob – a mob that constantly spawns, similar to the [[squid]], but also constantly despawns because when a player is not around it does not serve any purpose.<ref name="bats" />
*The updated texture of the bat was created in roughly 2 hours. However, the model and animations took longer.<ref>{{Tweet|JasperBoerstra|1751333853153624256|The bat remodel was made in roughly 2 hours for example.}}</ref>
*During ''[[Minecraft: The Island]]'', there is a scene where [[Guy]] ends up wasting his final [[arrow]] when it accidentally hit a bat instead of a [[creeper]] during a pivotal moment. According to author [[Max Brooks]], this was something that actually happened to him while playing.<ref>{{Mcnet|the-mountain|The Mountain|March 2, 2021|Alex Wiltshire}}</ref>
