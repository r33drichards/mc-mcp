A '''powered rail''' is a type of [[rail]] that either increases or halts the velocity of [[minecart]]s depending on its [[Redstone power|power state]], and can be used to accelerate a minecart from a standstill when placed facing a [[conductive block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The correct tool to break a powered rail is a [[pickaxe]]. It will always drop itself when broken, regardless of the tool used.

== Usage ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Minecarts}}
A powered rail can be used as a [[rail]] and as a [[redstone component]].

To place a powered rail, {{control|use}} a powered rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the powered rail should occupy. A powered rail can be placed on:

* the '''top''' of any full solid [[opaque]] block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components ([[command block]]s, [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, [[note block]]s, and [[redstone lamp]]s)
* the '''top''' of a [[hopper]], upside-down [[slab]], or upside-down [[stairs]].

A powered rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the powered rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a powered rail to the side of the fence causes the powered rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead.

When placed, a powered rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent [[rail]]s (including [[activator rail]]s, [[detector rail]]s, and other [[powered rail]]s), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a powered rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a powered rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the powered rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a powered rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a powered rail "prefers", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails. Unlike their unpowered counterparts, and like detector and activator rails, powered rails are always straight.

It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands, which is intentional.<ref>{{bug|MC-182709}}</ref>

=== Rail ===
{{main|Rail}}

Powered rails (and other rails) can be used as "roads" for [[minecart]]s. A minecart that enters a powered rail's space from either end of the powered rail continues to move in the direction the powered rail is facing, but its speed may change depending on whether the powered rail is active or not (see below). A minecart that enters a powered rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the powered rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted powered rail.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

Powered rails can be used to affect the speed of minecarts that travel over them.

;Activation

: A powered rail is a [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|redstone mechanism]] and can be activated by:
:* an adjacent active '''[[power component]]''' (for example, a [[redstone torch]], a [[block of redstone]], a [[daylight sensor]], etc.)
:* an adjacent '''powered block''' (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)
:* a powered '''[[redstone comparator]]''' or '''[[redstone repeater]]''' facing the powered rail
:* powered '''[[redstone dust]]''' configured to point at the powered rail; a powered rail is ''not'' activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is a directionless "dot" or configured to point in another direction.
:* {{IN|be}} powered rails only activate on the input/consumer [[redstone tick]] (C-tick).
: An activated powered rail also activates any adjacent powered rails it is connected to, up to eight away from the original activation source. Thus a single activation source can activate up to 17 rails (one original in the middle and eight on either side). An activated powered rail does not activate non-connected adjacent rails.

;Behavior

: An ''active'' powered rail:
:* increases the speed of a moving minecart in the direction it is already moving. Specifically, let the speed in both the X and Z directions (meters / tick) combined be "speed". If speed > 0.01, then every tick the minecart is passing over the powered rail, its x velocity is increased by (xspeed * 0.06 / speed) and its z velocity is increased by (zspeed * 0.06 / speed)
:* accelerate a non-moving minecart away from a solid opaque block the powered rail is facing (so a non-moving minecart moves away from the block when the powered rail activates, and a moving minecart bounces off a block an active powered rail is facing because it stops and then gets accelerated away)

: An ''inactive'' powered rail reduces the speed of a moving minecart, usually stopping it within one block's distance even on a downward-slanted track. If a slanted powered rail activates with a non-moving minecart on it, the minecart starts moving downward (because it is no longer being braked by an inactive powered rail) and is then accelerated downward.

: Powered rails cannot increase the speed of a minecart to more than 8 blocks per second on either the north-south or east-west axis. The speeds that can be achieved with varying numbers of powered rails or intervals of normal rails between powered rails is complex -- for a thorough discussion, see [[Tutorial:Minecarts]].

=== Mob interaction ===
Like other types of rails, [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[warden]]s are the only land mobs that can walk onto powered rails.

=== Piston interactivity ===
A powered rail can be pushed by a [[piston]], and can be pulled by a [[sticky piston]]. However, it breaks and drops as an item when it is unsupported due to being moved.
