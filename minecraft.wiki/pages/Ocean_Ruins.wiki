'''Ocean ruins''' are underwater [[structure]]s primarily composed of [[stone bricks]] or [[sandstone]]. They are found in [[ocean]] biomes and rarely on [[beach]]es, and are inhabited by [[drowned]] and rarely by [[zombie nautilus]]es alongside it. They contain [[chest]]s, [[suspicious sand]], and [[suspicious gravel]], which hold a variety of [[loot]], notably the buried [[treasure map]] and the [[sniffer egg]]. These ruins have cold and warm underwater variants that vary from single huts to large villages.

== Generation ==
Cold ocean ruins generate in normal, cold, and frozen [[ocean]] biomes or in their deep variants. They are composed of stone materials and contain some [[suspicious gravel]] blocks that can be excavated using a [[brush]].

Warm ocean ruins generate in warm, lukewarm, and deep lukewarm ocean biomes, and are composed of sandstone and stone materials as well as having some blocks of [[suspicious sand]] within them.

Ocean ruins may at times be at least partially buried, including with their airspaces. During generation, all air blocks and structure blocks act as [[structure void]]s. This means that their associated suspicious blocks are also located under layers of usual [[sand]], [[gravel]], and even [[stone]].

Suspicious sand and gravel randomly replace sand and gravel respectively during generation, and are not part of the [[structure definition]].

Although most ocean ruins generate underwater, they sometimes generate on land, bordering a [[beach]] or another seaside [[biome]].

30% of ocean ruins generate as large ocean ruins; the other 70% generate as small ruins. If the ocean ruin is large, there is a 90% chance for 4-8 (inclusive) small ocean ruins to generate around it in a cluster. If the ocean ruin is warm, large ocean ruins generate with a [[structure integrity]] of 0.9 and small ocean ruins generate with a structure integrity of 0.8. If the ocean ruin is cold, the "brick" variant of the chosen structure type generates with a structure integrity of 0.9 if large and 0.8 if small. The "cracked" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.7 and the "mossy" variant generates with a structure integrity of 0.5, both regardless of size. Reduced structure integrity may also remove [[drowned]] and [[zombie nautilus]]es from the structures.

== Structure ==
{{main|/Structure}}
{{info needed section|Specific chance of zombie nautilus spawning}}
The shape and size of ocean ruins varies greatly, and they often generate together in groups to create ruined villages.

All but two of the structures contain a loot [[chest]] with loot inside. The chest contains loot for specifically either a small or large sized ocean ruin structure and may be buried under blocks such as [[gravel]] and [[sand]].

Cold ocean ruins are primarily composed of [[stone bricks]], [[gravel]], and [[suspicious gravel]], and they also contain [[prismarine]], [[sand]], [[magma block]]s, [[sea lantern]]s, [[polished granite]], [[glazed terracotta]], [[bricks]], [[planks]], [[cobblestone]], [[mossy cobblestone]], [[stone brick stairs]], [[obsidian]], or a [[chest]] with loot in it. Warm ocean ruins are primarily composed of [[sand]], [[sandstone]], and [[suspicious sand]], and they also contain [[polished granite]], [[polished diorite]], [[sea lantern]]s, [[magma block]]s, [[gravel]], [[terracotta]], [[sandstone stairs]], or a loot [[chest]].

Natural ocean ruins generate following the rules above and may not exactly match the stored structures.

The structures below are located in the folder <code>[[client.jar]]/data/minecraft/structures/underwater_ruin</code>. The following is a complete table of the structures with their filenames, descriptions and what they consist of.

Each {{BlockLink|Structure Block|structure block}} indicates either a chest with random loot or the spawn location of a drowned/zombie nautilus [[mob]].

=== Mobs ===

Upon world generation, many of the structures spawn with [[drowned]] (usually one or two, though a few structures have three or four). These drowned are persistent, and do not despawn. Adult drowned wielding tridents may also also spawn riding a [[zombie nautilus]] as a zombie nautilus jockey.

Zombie nautiluses spawned from ruins are also persistent and will even spawn on [[Peaceful]] difficulty, despite being [[monster]]s, as the mobs spawned from ocean ruins count as part of the structure and ignore conventional spawning mechanics, leaving the zombie nautilus spawning on Peaceful by itself.<ref>{{bug|MC-304858||Zombie nautiluses can spawn on peaceful by themselves, unlike skeleton/zombie horses and camel husks}}</ref>
