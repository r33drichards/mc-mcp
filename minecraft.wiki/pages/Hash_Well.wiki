A '''hash well''' is a [[feature]] mostly consisting of [[charred baked potato bricks]] in [[24w14potato]].

== Generation ==
Hash wells generate on the surface in the [[hash]] biome.

== Structure ==
Hash wells are very similar in structure to [[desert well]]s, but they are built from [[charred baked potato brick]]s and its [[Charred Baked Potato Brick Slab|slab variant]]. The water inside of the well is actually waterlogged [[light block]]s of level 15, causing the well to glow.

== Loot ==
Like regular desert wells, this structure generates with no chest. They do not generate with [[suspicious sand]].
