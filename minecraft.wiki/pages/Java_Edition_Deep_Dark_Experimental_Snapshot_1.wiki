'''Deep Dark Experimental Snapshot 1''' is the first and only experimental snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on February 17, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|a-very-scary-snapshot|A Very Scary Snapshot|February 17, 2022}}</ref> which adds features related to the [[deep dark]]. This version is a fork of [[Java Edition 1.18.1|1.18.1]]. After the release of [[Java Edition 1.18.2|1.18.2]], the deep dark features previewed in this version gradually made their way into official snapshots between [[22w11a]] and [[22w13a]]. This is the first and only experimental snapshot released in 2022.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Reinforced Deepslate JE1.png|32px]] [[Reinforced deepslate]]'''
* A new block only found in [[ancient cities]] shaped as a large frame.
* Is completely blast-resistant, and takes an incredibly long amount of time to mine (82.5 seconds).
* Can be broken, but won't drop anything, even with [[Silk Touch]].
* Can be moved with pistons.

'''[[File:Sculk JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome.
* Has an animated texture.
* Drops only [[experience]] when broken without [[Silk Touch]].
* When [[wool]] blocks are placed on a sculk block, it lets nearby [[sculk sensor]]s know, preventing that vibration from being occluded.
* Sculk blocks grow when a [[mob]] dies near a [[sculk catalyst]].

'''[[File:Sculk Catalyst Bloom JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk catalyst]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome.
* Emits soul particles after a mob dies within 8 blocks, and grows sculk related blocks.
** Spreads sculk blocks to wherever a nearby mob dies. The amount it spreads depends on the amount of experience the mob is meant to drop.
*** Even if the mob doesn't drop experience as it wasn't killed by a player, the blocks still spread based on the amount of experience it normally drops.
*** The experience isn't dropped in these cases.
** The charge decays over time, faster the furthest away from the catalyst it moves.
*** If a charge decays more than 4 blocks away from the catalyst, it has a chance of creating either a [[sculk sensor]] (90%) or a [[sculk shrieker]] (10%).
*** If a charge decays more than 24 blocks away from the catalyst, it merely vanishes.
* Drops only [[experience]] when broken without [[Silk Touch]].
* Emits a light level of 6.
* [[File:Sculk Catalyst Bloom.gif|32px]] Blooms when activated.
* Can only spread sculk on blocks in the <code>sculk_replaceable</code> [[tag]].

'''[[File:Sculk Shrieker JE1 BE2.gif|32px]] [[Sculk shrieker]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome.
* Has two soul-shaped patterns in the center.
* Has the ability to "shriek", emitting ring-like/sonic particles.
* Is activated by a [[sculk sensor]], [[redstone]] signal or player's stepping.
* Gives players the Darkness effect when activated.
* If activated three times, a warden is summoned from the ground.
** [[Sculk shrieker]]s summon [[warden]]s only if there isn't one within 48 blocks.

'''[[File:Sculk Vein JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk vein]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome on the edge of [[sculk]] patches.
* Generates in a layer on top of blocks and can be placed in all directions, like [[glow lichen]].
* Has an animated texture.
* Some have parts that are transparent, allowing the player to see the block it is on top of.
* Can be [[waterlogged]].
* Drops nothing when broken without [[Silk Touch]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Warden Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Warden spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Warden.gif|32px]] [[Warden]]'''
* Spawns in the deep dark biome, specifically when too many [[sculk shrieker]]s are activated.
** It is the only mob that spawns in the deep dark biome.
* "Emerges" from the ground when spawned by [[sculk shrieker]]s.
** Digs back into the ground when it doesn't sense any vibration after 60 seconds.
* The first fully blind mob.
** Has a sense of smell. It can detect and pathfind toward the general location of a player or mob through a "smelling" action.
*** Prioritizes smelling the player or mob that it is most suspicious of, rather than the one closest to it.
** Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it pathfinds toward the source of the movement.
*** It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.
*** When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to the [[sculk sensor]].
**** If any projectile (e.g. [[egg]], [[snowball]], [[arrow]]) lands near it, the warden inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating significant vibrations. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
*** Does not detect players that are sneaking.
** Can detect players or mobs that have the [[Invisibility]] effect.
* Becomes more suspicious of a player or mob as it detects its location more through vibrations and/or smelling. When it suspects the target enough, it identifies its exact location, which aggravates it, causing it to pathfind toward the target to attack regardless of outside distractions.
* Has {{hp|500}} health points and does {{hp|30}} damage on Normal difficulty, bringing players wearing full netherite [[armor]] from full health to {{hp|7}} health points.
* Wardens disable shields when they hit the players with their fists.
* The warden doesn't qualify as a target for the advancement "Monster Hunter" and isn't needed to receive the advancement "Monsters Hunted" due to its role.
* Warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the Darkness effect.
** The core creates a low throbbing or "heartbeat" sound as it pulses. The sound and animation speed up rapidly as the warden gets more suspicious of or closer to attacking a player or mob.
* Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding the [[iron golem]] and [[enderman]] in height and width (the same).

=== World generation ===
'''{{EnvLink|Ancient city}}'''
* Generates within the deep dark biome and includes all of the deep dark features within it.
* Made of [[deepslate]] and its variants, [[basalt]] and its variants, and [[gray wool]].
* Contains soul sand, soul fire and soul lanterns, as well as candles and skeleton skulls.
* Contains chests with unique loot, like the [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment.
* Has different levels and open spaces.

'''{{BiomeLink|Deep dark}}'''
* New [[biome]] at the "deepest depths of the world".
* Tends to generate under continental/mountainous areas, exclusively within the [[deepslate]] layer between Y=-1 and Y=-64.
* Contains [[ancient cities]].
* The floor is covered in [[sculk]] and contains all [[sculk]]-related blocks.
* Wardens can spawn there through the activation of [[sculk shrieker]]s.
** With the exception of [[Monster Spawner|spawner]]s, no mobs other than wardens can spawn there, similar to [[mushroom field]]s.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|warden_spawn_tracker}}'''
* Controls the spawning timers used by the warden: changing it to 3 summons a warden.
** Likely temporary/experimental due to success messages being bare translation strings.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Effect]]s'''
* [[File:Darkness JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Darkness]]
** A status effect triggered by the [[sculk shrieker]], causing the player's camera to dim in brightness, thus limiting the vision of players.

*** Cannot be obtained by [[fishing]], [[enchanting]], or other loot chests, similar to [[Soul Speed]].
