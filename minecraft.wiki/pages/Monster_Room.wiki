{{relevant tutorial|Defeating a monster room}}

A '''monster room''', commonly known as a '''dungeon''',<ref group="note">This name is still used to describe it in official media.{{cn}} </ref> is a [[structure]]-like [[feature]] found underground in the [[Overworld]]. It consists of a room with [[cobblestone]] walls and a floor made of cobblestone mixed with [[mossy cobblestone]]. A [[monster spawner]] that produces either [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, or [[spider]]s is found in the middle.

== Generation ==
Monster rooms generate uncommonly in the [[Overworld]] in any [[biome]] and always nearby [[carver cave]]s, [[canyon]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, and [[stronghold]]s. Each [[chunk]] has fourteen attempts to generate monster rooms underground within y-coordinates 0 to 320 or -58 to -1, each [[altitude]] range with different uniformity. For the higher altitude Y levels 0 to 320, up to 10 monster rooms can generate, while up to 4 monster rooms can generate in lower altitude Y levels -58 to -1. It is possible, though unlikely, for multiple attempts to succeed. {{IN|bedrock}}, monster rooms can generate as underground structures above sea level.

Monster rooms are a [[feature]] instead of a [[structure]], so they generate regardless of whether the "Generate structures" world creation option has been toggled off for said world.<ref>{{bug|MC-77787||Dungeons still generate when generate structures option is turned off|WF}}</ref> They also cannot be searched by the {{cmd|locate}} command,<ref>{{bug|MC-107829|||WAI}}</ref> but they are very common and can be found without much difficulty in spectator mode.

For each attempt, a location (the position for monster spawner) and size (an open area with a width and length of 7 or 9 and a height of 6) is chosen. The attempt succeeds if the following conditions are met:
* Blocks in the floor area (including under the walls) of the potential monster room must be [[legacy solid|solid]].
* Blocks in the ceiling area (including over the walls) of the potential monster room must be solid. The ceiling blocks may be gravity-affected such as [[gravel]] or [[sand]], which fall if disturbed by the player.
* The walls of the potential monster room must have 1–5 openings (2-high air blocks) at floor level. Monster rooms are always connected to a [[carver cave]] or other hollow structure, although it is possible for the monster room itself to overwrite most of a tiny cave.

If the location passes, [[air]] and [[cobblestone]] are placed, then 3 attempts are made to generate each of two [[chest]]s. To generate a chest, the chosen block must be empty and must have a solid block on exactly one of its four sides. The [[monster spawner]] is placed at the center of the monster room.

The monster spawner has a 50% chance of producing [[zombie]]s, a 25% chance of producing [[skeleton]]s, and a 25% chance of producing [[spider]]s. A zombie monster spawner {{in|bedrock}} also has the same chance (5%) of producing [[zombie villager]]s as in natural generation.

Cobblestone has a 75% chance to be [[mossy cobblestone|mossy]] when it is on the floor of the monster room.

The [[command]] <code>/place feature minecraft:monster_room ~ ~ ~</code> can be used to generate a monster room only when the player is under the specific location where the monster room could be found naturally.

== Construction ==
{{main|Monster Room/Structure}}

Monster rooms are small rooms made of [[cobblestone]] and [[mossy cobblestone]] that contain a [[monster spawner]] and up to 2 [[chest]]s. Finding a monster room without a chest is unlikely but possible. Additionally, there is a rare chance of a monster room being found without a monster spawner. Occasionally, a monster room generates with its chests in such a way as to create a double chest. Monster rooms generate with either a [[zombie]] (50% chance), [[skeleton]] (25% chance), or [[spider]] (25% chance) monster spawner. The monster spawner is always in the center of the monster room, with chests located around the walls of the room (large chests can connect with the short side against the wall). Each block of the floor has a 25% chance of being cobblestone and a 75% chance of being mossy cobblestone.

Because the horizontal range for spawning mobs is 4 blocks from the monster spawner, it is possible for mobs to be spawned outside the walls of a 5×5 monster room that is surrounded by air outside the walls.
