{{Infobox command

}}

Manages [[dialog]] screens displayed to [[player]]s. Allows server [[operator]]s to show custom or predefined dialogs in [[data pack]] to specified players, and clear any displayed dialogs on their screen.

==Syntax==
: {{cd|/dialog show <targets> <dialog>}}
:: Shows a dialog screen from inline [[SNBT]] or {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry (usually defined in a [[data pack]]) to specified players.
: {{cd|/dialog clear <targets>}}
:: Clears currently displayed dialogs for specified players.

==Arguments==
{{argument|targets|entity}}
: Specifies the players whose dialog is shown or cleared.
: {{arg desc|je=entity|amount=multiple|type=players}}

{{argument|dialog|dialog}}
: Specifies the dialog to show to the players. This argument is only used with {{cmd|link=none|dialog show}}.
: Must be either:
:* A namespaced ID of a dialog defined in a data pack (e.g., {{code|custom:my_dialog}} or {{code|minecraft:server_links}}). These are stored in the {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry.
:* An inline [[SNBT]] defining the dialog structure directly in the command. See {{slink|Dialog|Dialog format}} for the structures.

==Result==
{{Result table|onlyje=1}}
{{Result table|The command is incomplete, or any argument is not specified correctly.|unparseable}}
{{Result table|cmd=/dialog (show{{!}}clear) <targets>|{{cd|targets}} is a target selector that includes any entities other than the player.|fail}}
{{Result table|cmd=/dialog show <targets> <dialog>|{{cd|dialog}} is not a valid dialog [[SNBT]], or dialog does not exist in {{cd|minecraft:dialog}} registry (usually in a [[data pack]]).|fail}}
{{Result table|cmd=|succeed}}
{{Result table}}

== Output ==
{{Output table}}
{{Output table|edition=je|On fail|0|0|0}}
{{Output table|On success|1|1|the number of targeted players}}
{{Output table}}

==Examples==

* To show the nearest player a dialog located at <code>data/custom/dialog/example/test.json</code> in a loaded data pack:
*:<code>/dialog show @p custom:example/test</code>

* To show all players the built-in <code>minecraft:server_links</code> dialog:
*:<code>/dialog show @a minecraft:server_links</code>

* To show nearest players a [[Dialog#notice|notice dialog]] with title "Hello" and an "Ok" button in the footer:
*:<code>/dialog show @p {type:"minecraft:notice",title:"Hello"}</code>

* To show all players a simple [[Dialog#confirmation|confirmation dialog]] with two action buttons with the label "Yes please" and "Nope". If the player presses "Yes please", the game runs a command to give the player a [[diamond]], otherwise, if they press "Nope", the game closes the dialog: 
*:<code>/dialog show @a {type:"minecraft:confirmation",title:"Give yourself diamond?",yes:{label:"Yes please","action":{"type":"run_command","command":"give @s diamond"}},no:{label:"Nope"}}</code>

* To clear any currently visible dialogs for all players:
*:<code>/dialog clear @a</code>
