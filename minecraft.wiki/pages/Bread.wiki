Farmer villagers may throw bread at players under the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.{{only|java}}

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management}}

Bread can be eaten with the use control while it is selected in the [[hotbar]]. Eating bread restores {{hunger|5}} [[hunger]] and 6.0 [[Hunger#Mechanics|hunger saturation]].

=== Breeding ===
Villagers can pick up bread items to become willing, allowing them to breed. Villagers require 3 bread to become willing.

=== Composting ===
Placing bread into a [[composter]] has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. It is more efficient to compost [[wheat]] than bread made from wheat.
