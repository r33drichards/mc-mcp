'''v0.11.0 alpha''' is a major update to ''[[Pocket Edition|Minecraft: Pocket Edition]]'' which was released on June 4, 2015. This update adds many new feature such as [[skin]]s, [[boat]]s, [[fishing]], [[status effect]]s, new mobs such as [[squid]] and [[cave spider]]s, and more.<ref name="0.11.0">{{tweet|_tomcc|606032903395536897|Nah, MCPE 0.11 will be out tomorrow, not in 4 hours.

Before 0.11, some players would modify their game files to replace the default skin, but in multiplayer this would only be visible to them and would apply to all players. Proper skin changing had been noted as one of the key {{el|je}} features missing from {{el|pe}}.
