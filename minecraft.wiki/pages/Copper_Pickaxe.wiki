A '''copper pickaxe''' is a variant of [[pickaxe]] that is crafted from [[copper ingot]]s. It is the fourth-highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[stone pickaxe]]. It has a [[mining level]] of 1, the same as a stone pickaxe, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[copper ore]], [[iron ore]], and [[lapis lazuli ore]].

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
A copper pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a copper pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s. Copper pickaxes mine faster than stone pickaxes but slower than iron.

==== Mining level ====
Copper pickaxes have a mining level of 1. Copper pickaxes can mine the same blocks as stone pickaxes, meaning that they can mine copper, iron and lapis lazuli ores and blocks made from these minerals, but cannot mine redstone, gold, diamond or emerald ores, netherite or obsidian.

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
Copper pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take 0.833 seconds to [[recover]]. Copper pickaxes do {{hp|3}} damage per attack, or 3.6 damage per second.

==== {{BE}} ====
Copper pickaxes attack instantly, and do {{hp|4}} damage per attack, or 8 damage per second.

A copper pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[copper ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 47 durability (25%, rounded down). Two copper pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A copper pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
