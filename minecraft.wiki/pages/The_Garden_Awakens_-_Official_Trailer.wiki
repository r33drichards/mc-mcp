== Summary ==

=== Part 1 ===
[[Efe]] and [[Kai]] enter into a [[Pale Garden|pale garden]], coming early enough to see several blooming [[Eyeblossom|eyeblossoms]]. A [[creaking]] stalks the two from behind, but only Efe appears to notice. Suspicious, Efe decides to investigate, only to get scared by a [[chicken]]. As the chicken runs away, the creaking reemerges, and scares Efe. Running down a long path in the garden, Efe is cornered by a [[pale oak]], only managing to stop the creaking by staring at it. However, the chicken then reappears, distracting Efe and allowing the creaking to strike.

=== Part 2 ===
After escaping the creaking, Efe runs through [[Pale Hanging Moss|hanging pale moss]] with a [[sword]]. Bumping into Kai again, the creaking is quick to catch up with them. Efe tries to slash it with the sword, discovering it has no effect. As Kai notices the glow from the [[Creaking Heart|creaking heart]], the creaking strikes again.

=== Part 3 ===
In the shadows, an unseen creaking lurks and fidgets. It senses Kai picking eyeblossoms with [[shears]], and begins creeping up from the dark. As it wanders closer, eyeblossoms begin to bloom, alerting Kai. At the last second, Kai senses the creaking, disabling its movement. The scene cuts to the two in hot pursuit, the video abruptly ending.

== Trivia ==
* The Garden Awakens - Official Trailer started development even before Minecraft Live 2024 announced the garden awakens as Filmic Art had access to early designs of the eyeblossoms and the pale oak tree being a regular oak tree.<ref>https://filmicart.com/en/work/the-garden-awakens/</ref>
