The '''firefly''' was a scrapped [[mob]] that would glow in the dark and be eaten by frogs that was featured in [[Minecraft Live 2021]]. It was later repurposed as a [[particle]] generated by [[firefly bush]]es.

== Behavior ==
Fireflies were two pixels in size, rather than the single pixel size of the implemented firefly particle, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. Fireflies were originally going to be the mob eaten by [[frog]]s to produce [[froglight]]s, later being replaced by [[magma cube]]s in this role. Frogs eating fireflies was scrapped because some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life.<ref>{{ytl|a5Wd9ciTmTI|t=544}}</ref> Fireflies themselves were scrapped for being a "performance nightmare", which was not outweighed enough by its positive benefits for ambience.<ref>{{ytl|5BSQAVOSYOA|t=445}}</ref>
