* When 2 blocks are placed diagonally from each other with water or lava on one side and air on the other, the player can swim up even if they are standing on the dry side.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''[13:21] <vdgmprgrmr> If you have two blocks that are diagonal from each other, but touching, and water is on one side of the divide, and nothing is on the other, if you stand in the dry side, and go into the most inward corner you can, you can swim up by pressing space, even though you're not in water.''"

== Trivia ==
* This is the earliest version in the [[launcher]] that is ''not'' a developer build.
