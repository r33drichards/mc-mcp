A '''piglin head''' is the [[head]] of a [[piglin]] in the form of a [[block]]. It can only be obtained by killing a piglin using a [[charged creeper]]'s [[explosion]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of piglin head.<ref>{{bug|MC-192905||Heads & Skulls have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Piglin Head}}
Piglin head drops itself when it's destroyed.
When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the piglin head always drops as an item.

=== Mob loot ===
Piglin heads are always dropped by a [[piglin]] if it dies from a [[charged creeper]]'s explosion. {{IN|bedrock}}, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads; however, {{in|java}}, only one mob selected at random drops its head.<ref>{{bug|MC-63534|||WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
Piglin heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to [[sign]]s. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

When placed and powered by redstone, the piglin head flaps its ears (2 times per second for the right ear and 2.5 times per second for the left ear). The same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or [[armor stand]] (note: the animation does not play if the <code>NoGravity</code> tag is set to 1)

=== Wearing ===
{{See also|#Renders}}
The player can wear piglin heads, similarly to [[pumpkin]]s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

==== Disguise ====
Wearing a piglin head reduces the detection range for [[piglin]]s to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from [[sneaking]] and from the [[Invisibility]] status effect.

{{IN|bedrock}}, wearing a piglin head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]].

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a piglin head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

=== Enchantments ===
Piglin heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an [[anvil]].

=== Note blocks ===
Placing a piglin head above a [[note block]] causes the note block to play the [[piglin]]'s {{cd|ambient}} sound when activated.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Piglin head is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
