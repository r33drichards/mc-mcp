'''<samp>leaves_carried</samp>'''<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-pocket-edition/mcpe-discussion/1968560-my-report-on-3-strange-new-blocks?comment=8</ref> was a [[block]] that was used as the item [[model]] for [[leaves]].

== Obtaining ==
<samp>leaves_carried</samp> is known to be obtainable only through the use of inventory editors and other external tools.

=== Breaking ===
The speed at which <samp>leaves_carried</samp> breaks is not currently known.{{needs testing}} They drop regular leaves when broken with [[shears]].

{{Breaking row|leaves_carried|horizontal=1|foot=1|sprite=oak-leaves}}

== Usage ==

=== Appearance ===
In its base state, <samp>leaves_carried</samp> highly resembles actual [[leaves]]. There are, however, differences: the main difference is that it appears darker than normal leaves, which is due to them using a [[tint]], despite the texture they use already being colored, rather than the grayscale that tinted blocks usually use. Specifically, this tint is the color {{color|#48b518}}.

However, higher metadata versions of <samp>leaves_carried</samp> behave unexpectedly. Perhaps most interesting is metadata 1, which corresponds to spruce leaves, which uses a [[crafting table]]'s side textures rather than anything relevant to leaves. This could be explainable through examination of <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp>, however, this is yet to be done.{{info needed|So what causes it?}}

Metadata 1 (corresponding to spruce leaves) is tinted with {{color|#619961}}, and metadata 2 (corresponding to birch leaves) is tinted with {{color|#80a755}}. The behavior of metadata 3, which corresponds to what would eventually become jungle leaves in the same version that removes <samp>leaves_carried</samp>, is currently unknown.{{info needed|So what did it do?}}

=== Functional differences from leaves ===
Despite very closely resembling leaves visually, <samp>leaves_carried</samp> do not [[History of leaf decay|decay]].

Whether they drop saplings when broken without shears is unknown. If broken with shears they drop regular leaves.
