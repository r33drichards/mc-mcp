{{Exclusive|Java}}
Various '''API testing capes''' have occasionally appeared on Mojang's servers. These were used to test the {{JE}} cape API. Some of these were placed as a response to players discovering previous testing capes.

These are not official capes and cannot be obtained, and may have been removed from the servers since. They are only here for documentation purposes.

| A cape that has similar color palette to the [[sniffer]] has been found on Mojang's staging texture server and on Mojang's production texture server.{{citation needed}} It was added to Mojang's staging texture server on October 10, 2023 and added to Mojang's production texture server 7 days later on October 17, 2023. The cape was first seen on the account of software engineer Dat Trieu (etanaratsastaja) and another account on Mojang's staging server database. It was then given to the player KemiAmu due to a bug.<ref>{{citation|url=https://namemc.com/profile/KemiAmu.1|title=KemiAmu &vert; Minecraft Profile &vert; NameMC|website=namemc.com}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://laby.net/cape/c7091e237e7562e73990a97dda5bc554|title=Test &vert; Minecraft Cape &vert; laby.net|website=laby.net}}</ref>
