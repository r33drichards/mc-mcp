The '''gravelly mountains+''' or '''extreme hills plus trees mutated''' (also referred to as '''modified gravelly mountains''' in code{{Only|JE}}) was a rare variant of the [[Windswept Hills|windswept hills]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.{{Infobox biome

== Description ==
Like other mountain biomes, the gravelly mountains+ featured a mountainuous terrain, often passing the minimum [[snow]] height, with steep cliffs and floating islands. Like the regular [[gravelly mountains]], the floor was mostly covered with [[gravel]], with occasional blobs of [[Grass Block|grass blocks]] and [[stone]]. Oak and spruce [[Tree|trees]] rarely generated on the grass blocks. [[Emerald Ore|Emerald ore]] and [[Infested Stone|infested stone]] sometimes replaced stone in this biome.

{{IN|JE}}, the gravelly mountains+ had the exact same terrain and vegetation as the regular gravelly mountains<ref>{{bug|MC-188096||Gravelly Mountains+ is no different than Gravelly Mountains|Fixed}}</ref>.

{{IN|BE}}, the regular gravelly mountains did not generate trees, making this biome unique. Unlike in ''Java Edition'', gravel covered almost the entire biome, with only a few one-block wide stripes of grass blocks crossing the area. This also made trees much rarer.

Gravelly mountains+ generated within mountain biomes roughly the same way as regular gravelly mountains did, but they also generated when a [[wooded mountains]] that generated between a [[desert]] and a [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]] became modified. Usually, the desert and snowy plains became modified too and were replaced with [[Desert Lakes|desert lakes]] and [[Ice Spikes|ice spikes]].

== Mobs ==
Gravelly mountains+ had the same mob spawning chances as windswept hills.

The following mobs naturally spawned here:
