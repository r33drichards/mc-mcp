* Doors have been changed to properly detect if they are open or closed. Double doors in existing maps are not affected.
* Placing two [[pressure plate]]s directly in front of doors and stepping on them opens doors correctly.

* Added rare [[item]] drops for mobs.
* Improved movement when mobs are in [[water]].
* Most mobs now move slower.
* When a player is targeted by a hostile mob, it continues to track the player despite being attacked by other mobs.
