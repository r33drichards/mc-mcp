A '''copper spear''' is a variant of [[spear]] crafted from [[copper ingot]]s. It can be used to perform slow jab attacks or held forward to deal increasing [[damage]] based on how quickly the wielder is moving. It is the fifth-highest [[tier]] of spear, dealing the same damage as a [[stone spear]] but with lower attack speed.

== Usage ==
=== Attacking ===
==== Jab attack ====
A copper spear can be {{control|attack|text=used}} while standing on the ground to perform a jab attack, dealing damage, and afterwards entering a recharge cooldown similar to that of an ender pearl or chorus fruit on Bedrock Edition, or a version of the normal attack cooldown on Java Edition.

==== Charge attack ====
When holding down the {{control|attack|text=use}} key, the spear is lowered into an attack position, where colliding with a target deals damage depending on the velocity of the user, and the attack dismounts attacked targets from their mounts. After being held out for too long, the charge attack goes into a shaking state where attacks no longer dismount targets from their mounts. After even longer, the charge attack goes into a dropped down state where attacks no longer deal [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]], but still deal full damage.
