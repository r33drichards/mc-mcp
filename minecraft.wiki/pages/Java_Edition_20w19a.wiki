'''20w19a''' is the fifteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on May 6, 2020,<ref name="20w19a">{{snap|20w19a|May 6, 2020}}</ref> which fixed bugs and made tweaks to mob spawning.

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[The Nether]]'''
* [[Ore (feature)|Blob]]s of [[blackstone]] and [[gravel]] now generate in all Nether biomes at level of the [[lava]] ocean.
* Blobs of [[soul sand]] now generate in [[soul sand valley]]s at level of the lava ocean.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Added a statistic for distance by [[strider]].

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>prevent_mob_spawning_inside</code> block tag.
** Contains the <code>[[Tag#blocks rails|#rails]]</code> block tag, as well as [[wither rose]]s and [[sweet berry bush]]es.
** Mobs cannot spawn in blocks in this tag.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Blackstone]]'''
* Now uses the top texture on the bottom face.

'''[[Door|Crimson and warped door]]s'''
* Texture changed to include hinges.

'''[[Crimson Roots|Crimson]] and [[warped roots]]'''
* Are now randomly offset, similarly to [[grass]] and [[flower]]s.

'''[[Nether sprouts]]'''
* Now require [[shears]] to be obtained.
* Are now randomly offset, similarly to grass and flowers.

'''[[Redstone wire]]'''
* Now visually connects when traveling up [[soul sand]], 8-layer [[snow]] stacks and the back of upside-down [[stairs]].
* Particles are now generated across the entire area of the redstone wire; previously they only appeared at the center.
** This now causes the particles to appear at the incorrect positions when millions of blocks away from the spawn point, due to precision loss<ref>{{bug|MC-182748}}</ref> (see [[Java Edition distance effects]]).

'''[[Twisting vines]] and [[weeping vines]]'''
* Lowered the amount that they grow when {{ctrl|using}} [[bone meal]].

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Mobs can no longer spawn within blocks occupied by a [[wither rose]] (except [[wither skeleton]]s).
* Spawning has been tweaked to more closely follow mob caps.
** Mobs in [[soul sand valley]]s and [[warped forest]]s create a radius around them that prevents other mobs of the same type from spawning, which gets bigger as more mobs spawn.

'''[[Fish]]'''
* Now have their own mob category and mob cap.

'''[[Hoglin]]s and [[piglin]]s'''
* Now become [[zoglin]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s respectively when in [[the End]].

'''[[Iron golem]]s'''
* [[Villager]]s can now spawn iron golems regardless of their profession status or latest working time.

=== World generation ===
'''[[The Nether]]'''
* [[Bastion remnant]]s are now slightly less common.
* Tweaked [[biome]] distribution.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Block categories and tag names are no longer bold.

'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* [[Clock]]s and [[compass]]es no longer function in the recipe book menu.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Changed the <code>stairs</code> block and item tags to use their respective <code>wooden_stairs</code> tag.
** This has effectively made crimson stairs and warped stairs a part of this tag.
