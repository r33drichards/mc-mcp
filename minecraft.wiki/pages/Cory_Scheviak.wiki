'''Cory 'Cojomax99' Scheviak''' is a member of the ''[[Minecraft: Java Edition]]'' and ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' development teams at [[Mojang Studios]]. He first announced that he was joining the Mojang team on May 11, 2018.<ref>{{tweet|Cojomax99|994986072433143808}}</ref> Most of what he does with the Mojang team is fixing bugs. He is currently actively developing the Tropicraft and Camera Obscura ''Minecraft'' mods. He started playing ''Minecraft'' in October 2010, and began developing mods in 2011.<ref>https://www.minecraft-france.fr/interview-cory-scheviak/</ref>

== Trivia ==
* He designed the original [[Bad Omen]] mechanic, where after defeating a [[pillager captain]], the player would trigger a [[raid]] the instant they entered a [[village]].<ref>{{ytl|aBTJIYzJDJw|THE BIOME THAT BROKE MINECRAFT|Minecraft|Oct 12, 2025}}</ref> This was later changed to the current mechanic, where the player can use an [[ominous bottle]] to have full control over when a raid starts.
