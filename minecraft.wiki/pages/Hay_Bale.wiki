'''Hay bales''' are storage [[block]]s equivalent to nine pieces of [[wheat]]. They are used as a [[crafting]] ingredient, to feed [[llama]]s and all [[horse]] variants, reduce [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]], and extend [[campfire]] smoke.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Hay bales can be [[breaking|mined]] using any [[tool]], but a hoe speeds up the process.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Hay Bale|Hoe|Any}}

=== Natural generation ===
Hay bales often generate as [[pile]]s (and in some houses, animal pens, farms, or meeting points) scattered around in [[village]]s located in [[plains]], and less commonly in [[savanna]] and [[desert]] villages. They also can generate under some [[campfire]]s in [[taiga]] villages and as a part of targets/scarecrows in [[pillager outpost]]s.

=== Crafting ===

== Usage ==
Hay bales can be used as compact storage of [[wheat]].

=== Placement ===
[[File:Orientables.png|thumb|right|Seen here alongside [[log]]s, [[bone block]]s, [[quartz pillar]]s, [[purpur pillar]]s, [[polished basalt]], and [[barrel]]s, hay bales can be pointed in multiple directions.]]

Hay bales can be placed pointing in all three spatial dimensions, in the same way as a log is placed. However, there is no "six-sided" variant like that of the [[wood]] block.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Food ===
Although players cannot eat hay bales, hay bales serve as a compact wheat supply for crafting food items during long periods away from other food sources. A full stack of 64 hay bales is equivalent to 192 loaves of [[bread]] in a single inventory slot.

=== Animals ===
Hay bales can be fed to [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, [[llama]]s, or [[mule]]s to heal up to 10 hearts. They are an effective method to heal horses if the player wants to heal them in a short period of time. They also speed up the growth of foals by three minutes and baby llamas by 90 seconds.

==== Breeding ====
Hay bales can be used both to lead and [[Breeding|breed]] llamas.

=== Falling ===
Falling onto a hay bale reduces the [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]] by 80%, meaning whatever falls on a hay bale takes 20% of the normal fall damage.

Below are some example damages a player receives falling on a hay bale (assuming no enchantments and/or status effects that reduce fall damage).

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Falling on a hay bale examples
|-
! Fall height !! Fall damage
|-
| 4-8 blocks || {{health|1}}
|-
| 9-13 blocks || {{health|2}}
|-
| 95-100 blocks || {{health|19}}
|-
| 101-103 blocks || {{health|20}}
|-
| 115-120 blocks || {{health|23}}
|}

Thus, it is possible to fall onto a hay bale and survive a 100 block drop (starting with full health) or even a 120 block fall (starting with full health plus 2 [[Absorption]] hearts).

=== Campfires ===
Placing a hay bale under a [[campfire]] makes it a signal fire, increasing the height to which its smoke particles can rise from 10 blocks to 25 blocks.

=== Composting ===
Placing a hay bale into a [[composter]] has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Composting with hay bales is very inefficient, as the hay bale's chance to be composted is only slightly higher than wheat. For example, 900 wheat could be composted to yield 83{{frac|4|7}} [[bone meal]] on average, but if crafted into 100 hay bales, they would only yield 12{{frac|1|7}} bone meal on average.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s occasionally purchase a hay bale for a single [[emerald]].
{{Trade uses|Hay Bale}}

=== Note blocks ===
Hay bale can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "banjo" sounds.
