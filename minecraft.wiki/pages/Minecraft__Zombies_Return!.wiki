== Synopsis ==
[[Bobbie]] is on a mission. She’s already survived one encounter with [[Logan]], the jerk who attacked her village and turned her [[Johnny (character)|brother]] into a [[Zombie Villager|zombie]]. And now she won’t rest until she stops his evil plan to conquer the [[Overworld]] with his [[zombie]] horde. But the closer she gets to foiling Logan, the further away she gets from her original goal: finding a cure for her zombie brother.

[[Ben]] is on… babysitting duty. Separated from Bobbie, Ben is now in charge of caring for her little brother, Johnny, and keeping up with his Zombie Obedience Lessons. Lessons that are going well! Johnny doesn’t even need his [[Lead|leash]] anymore, and he hardly tries to eat people at all—unless they really, really deserve it. Logan’s abandoned lair is even starting to feel a little like home.

But while doing a little spring cleaning, Ben discovers Logan’s secret diary, filled with all his biggest plots, including his next target: a legendary hero named [[Pigstep Peggy]]. Now, it’s a race against time. Can Ben track down Bobbie and stop Logan before his zombies feast again? Can they win Peggy over to their cause? Will Johnny ever stop hungering for brains?  <ref name=MCZombiesR/>
