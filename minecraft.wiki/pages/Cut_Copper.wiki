'''Cut copper''' is an [[oxidizing]] metal block crafted from [[blocks of copper]]. Like other copper blocks, cut copper can be waxed to prevent oxidation.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cut copper can be mined only with a [[stone pickaxe]] or better. If cut copper is mined without the use of a [[pickaxe]], it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Oxidized cut copper, waxed oxidized cut copper, and waxed cut copper generates naturally in [[trial chambers]].

=== Waxing ===
Cut copper can be turned into the respective waxed cut copper by {{Control|using}} a [[honeycomb]] item on them. Waxed cut copper does not oxidize and are identical to the non-waxed version.

=== Scraping ===
{{Control|Using}} an [[axe]] on waxed cut copper turns it into the respective non-waxed cut copper. In addition, using an axe on exposed, weathered, or oxidized cut copper reverts it one stage to regular, exposed, or weathered cut copper respectively.

=== Lightning strike ===
Non-waxed cut copper is completely deoxidized when struck by lightning, and other non-waxed cut copper nearby is deoxidized randomly.

=== Oxidation ===
{{main|Oxidation}}
Non-waxed cut copper has four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). [[Lightning bolt]]s and [[axe]]s can remove the oxidation on cut copper. 

As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
