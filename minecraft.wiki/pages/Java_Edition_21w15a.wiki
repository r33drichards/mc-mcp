'''21w15a''' is the seventeenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on April 14, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w15a|April 14, 2021}}</ref> which adds blocks of raw metal and the ability for [[goat]]s to ram mobs and [[armor stand]]s, as well as some reorders of the items in the [[Creative inventory]] menu. It also reverts most changes to world generation made in previous snapshots, such as height limit and [[cave]] types. Due to the technical challenges on the new cave generations and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the developers, these changes were moved to [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YgKUZnUyak Caves and Cliffs Announcement]</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|a-caves---cliffs-announcement|A Caves & Cliffs announcement|April 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360059400852|title=Minecraft: Caves & Cliffs Update FAQ|website=Minecraft Help Center|date=April 17, 2021|quote=the first (1.17) released on June 8, and the second (1.18) released on November 30.}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Block of Raw Copper JE2 BE2.png; Block of Raw Iron JE3 BE2.png; Block of Raw Gold JE3 BE2.png|32px}} Blocks of raw metal'''
* Added [[block of raw iron]], [[block of raw copper]] and [[block of raw gold]].
** [[Piglin]]s don't pick up blocks of raw gold,<ref>{{Bug|MC-223141}}</ref> and don't get angry when a nearby player mines them.<ref>{{Bug|MC-223145}}</ref>
** Obtained through [[crafting]], and can be crafted back into their respective raw metal.
** Can't be [[smelt]]ed.<ref>{{Bug|MC-223185}} – resolved as "Invalid"</ref>

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Marker]]'''
* Added the marker entity meant for custom use cases like map making and data packs.
** Only exists on the server side, is never sent to clients.
** Does not do any updates of their own.
** Has a {{nbt|compound|data}} compound field that can contain any data.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|debug function}}'''
* New debug subcommand executes command with same syntax as function.
** Every executed command, message (even if it would be normally invisible), result or error is stored to file.
** Cannot be run from inside functions.

=== Sounds ===
'''[[Bone meal]]'''
* Added sounds for using bone meal.

'''[[Goat]]'''
* Added various new sounds for screaming goats.

=== General ===
'''<samp>[[server.properties]]</samp> arguments'''
* <code>resource-pack-prompt</code>
** Adds a custom message to be shown on resource pack prompt when <code>require-resource-pack</code> is used.
** Expects chat component syntax, can contain multiple lines.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Gold ore]], [[lapis lazuli ore]], [[deepslate copper ore]], [[deepslate lapis lazuli ore]]'''
* Slightly tweaked the textures of these blocks.

=== Items ===
'''Raw metal'''
* Tweaked the textures of [[raw iron]], [[raw gold]] and [[raw copper]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Goat]]s'''
* Now avoid walking on [[powder snow]].
* Can now ram other mobs and [[armor stand]]s to knock them a few blocks.
** [[Creeper]]s don't explode when attacked by a goat.

'''[[Axolotl]]s'''
* Gain one and a half minutes of moisture when a splash water bottle is thrown at them.

=== World generation ===
'''[[World height]]'''
* World height increase has been reverted and is now once again 256 blocks (from Y=0 to Y=255).
* Worlds created in snapshot [[21w05b]] or any earlier version can now once again be opened.
* Worlds created in any version between snapshot [[21w06a]] and [[21w14a]] can no longer be opened.
** This can be bypassed by setting the data version in <code>[[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]]</code> to anywhere from 2692 and below, to 2709 or higher. However, this causes issues.
* Creating a new world with the Prototype Data pack (or putting the data pack in an existing world with the bypass above) can try out the world generation for the later update using a data pack which activates the changes as an experimental custom world.

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Noise caves and aquifers have been switched off.
* Cave and [[canyon]] carvers have been returned to their old settings.
* Crack carvers have been switched off.

'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Ore distribution has been reverted to [[Ore/Pre-1.17 distribution|the pre-1.17 distribution]].
* [[Copper ore]] now generates between the bottom of the world and Y=192, being most common around Y=96.

'''[[Tuff]]'''
* Now generates in blobs from Y=0 to Y=16.

=== General ===
'''[[Title screen]]'''
* The main menu background is now in an [[amethyst geode]].

'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Reordered some blocks in the "Building Blocks" tab:
** [[Ancient debris]] was moved among other ores.
** [[Block of copper]] and [[block of netherite]] were moved among other metal blocks.
** [[Nether gold ore]] was moved among other ores.
** [[Block of amethyst]] was moved among other ore blocks.
** [[Deepslate emerald ore]] was moved among other ores.
** [[Cracked deepslate bricks]] and [[cracked deepslate tiles]] were moved among other [[deepslate]] blocks.
** [[Dripstone block]] was moved among other "stone" blocks.
