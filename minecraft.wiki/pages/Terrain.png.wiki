[[File:Terrain.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|<samp>terrain.png</samp> in [[13w01b]], the last Java Edition version to actually use this file.]]

'''<samp>terrain.png</samp>''' was a [[texture atlas]] found inside [[minecraft.jar]]. It was used to store the game's [[block]] and [[fluid]] textures, the block [[breaking]] animation, and some [[item]]s. It has been superseded with ''minecraft_textures_atlas_''.pngs, obtainable in the screenshots folder upon doing {{key|F3 + S}} in modern versions.

== Format ==
<samp>terrain.png</samp> is a fixed-width 256×256-pixel file that is split into different 16×16 squares which correspond to the texture for each block found in-game.

== Usage ==
Before the introduction of [[texture pack]]s, <samp>terrain.png</samp> had to be edited in order to change any textures found in-game. The file would have to be placed inside an edited <samp>minecraft.jar</samp> file in order to work.

=== Empty regions ===
[[File:Placeholder Texture JE1 BE1.png|right]]
{{main|Placeholder texture#Texture atlas blank spaces}}
Unused sections of the texture [[Placeholder texture#Texture atlas blank spaces|are occupied by lilac squares]], which distantly resemble the [[missing texture]] used from 13w16a onward. [[kz.png|The paintings sheet]] also used this purple texture, however other atlases, like <samp>[[items.png]]</samp> and <samp>[[particles.png]]</samp>, did not.

These regions are solely intended to mark unused spaces on the sheet. Despite this, there are several cases of these texture regions unintentionally being used by blocks, items and other features. The following list names some significant examples where this texture was used (full lists for each edition are available with example screenshots and version ranges: [[Java Edition placeholder texture uses|Java]], [[Bedrock Edition placeholder texture uses|Bedrock]], [[Legacy Console Edition placeholder texture uses|Console]])
* [[File:Placeholder Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]][[File:Locked chest JE3.png|32px]][[File:Locked chest (S) JE4.png|32px]] [[Locked chest]] (Java/Console)
* [[File:Placeholder Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Invalid Data Value Wool]] items with nonzero integer multiple of 16 damage values (Java/Console)
* [[File:Placeholder Texture Wheat.png|32px]] [[Wheat Seeds|Wheat]] with a growth state over 7 (Java)
* [[File:Cake (15 bites) JE1.png|32px]] [[Cake]] with more than 7 bites taken out of it (Java)
* [[File:Water JE5.png|32px]] [[Water]] in a short version range during [[Survival Test]] (Java)
* [[File:Placeholder Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Leaves]] as a held item{{verify}} in a short version range (Bedrock)
* [[File:leaves_carried BE1.png|32px]] <samp>[[leaves_carried]]</samp> (Bedrock)

== History ==
{{more images|section=1|Bedrock and Console Edition should include renders of blocks like with Java Edition, but only listed during the versions when said blocks are implemented}}
{{info needed section|following questions:
{{Collapse
|content=
* Java Edition:
** 12w36a beacon item form texture: the interior cube
** Was the lava texture added in in-20100110 truly unused, or was it used for the flowing lava texture, which, if it existed, was either unused or just looked like still lava? Was the flowing lava texture even added in this version, or was it added in a prior version and it used the grass top in that position as a placeholder?
** Likewise, a placeholder texture for fire wasn't added until a June 17th Infdev, despite fire being added more than six months earlier. Did fire even have a dedicated placeholder texture spot prior to this, and the dedicated placeholder texture just put in said space afterwards to mark it?
** The June 7, 2010 water/lava texture mapping bug implies there may be two different fire textures, even at this point, way before Beta 1.2. Does this mean two placeholder spots?
** How can placeholder textures be made to appear? There is a way to make them appear circa Beta 1.7.3 by having the game paused as soon as it opens with an animated block in view (results differ with double clicking vs the open world button). Version range for this, and are there any other ways in other versions? Could be useful for testing the unobtainable item forms for fire and gears to see which of the two textures they use for items, as well as the burning on fire first person overlay and burning mob overlay.
** When did torches get a top texture?
** When did doors stop using the dedicated right hinge texture?
** When did the furnace use a dedicated top texture?
** What texture did ender chests use for particles?
** Particle textures in general. What did logs use throughout history, for example?
** Clarify inf-20100624's cloth changes on this page as well - DV 35 changed from light gray to white
** Clarify Beta 1.3's redstone changes
** Verify the side texture used by repeaters and any UV changes affecting them
** Beta 1.7 fence UV changes? Should we even be documenting pure UV changes on this page at all?
** Missing Beta 1.8 changes: mossy cobblestone texture, and two of the other unused textures at the bottom of the file
** Stuff that should be added:
*** Wool item with damage which is a nonzero multiple of 16: appears as [[File:Placeholder Block JE1 BE1.png|32x32px]] in b1.2, and uses the newly planted nether wart texture on all sides in b1.9 onwards
*** Particles from breaking doors in b1.7 - b1.7.2
*** [[Weird Piston]]
*** Shrub
*** Green Shrub
*** Old item forms
**** Leaves
**** Grass Block
**** Grass/Fern/Shrub and historical colorations
**** Lily Pad
*** Technical block item forms
**** Crops
**** Oak Sign
**** Oak Wall Sign
**** Oak Door
**** Iron Door
**** Redstone Wire
**** Unpowered Redstone Repeater
**** Powered Redstone Repeater
**** Unpowered Redstone Comparator
**** Powered Redstone Comparator
**** Pumpkin Stem
**** Melon Stem
**** Nether Wart
**** Carrots
**** Potatoes
**** Cauldron
**** Brewing Stand
**** End Portal
**** Piston Head
**** Moving Piston
**** Flower Pot
**** Skull
**** Red Bed
**** Fire
**** Sugar Cane
**** Cocoa
**** Tripwire
** Stuff that might be worth adding:
*** Fluid texture mapping bugs in 0.27 SURVIVAL TEST and inf-20100607 - in the former, the placeholder texture is partially used
*** Infinite Water Source
*** Infinite Lava Source
*** Faceless furnaces, lit furnaces, pumpkins, jack o'lanterns and droppers
*** Old item forms
**** Ice
*** Technical block item forms
**** Lit Furnace
**** Lit Redstone Ore
**** Lit Redstone Lamp
**** Cake
**** Nether Portal
**** Double Stone Slab
**** Double Wooden Slab
**** Unlit Redstone Torch
**** Water
**** Lava
* Bedrock Edition:
** What textures were used throughout Pocket Edition's history, and when did unused future textures become used?
* Legacy Console Edition:
** Research versions prior to TU9
** All versions from PS4 1.77 to PS4 1.90 need to be added}}
