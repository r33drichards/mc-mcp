'''16w39c''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on September 30, 2016<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2016/09/minecraft-snapshot-16w39a-the-exploration-update/</ref> to fix some bugs and crashes from [[16w39a]] and [[16w39b]].

== Changes ==
'''[[Dispenser]]s'''
* Now dispense [[boat]]s facing the same way as the dispenser, instead of toward the dispenser.

'''[[Shulker]]s'''
* Can now be spawned on the sides and bottoms of blocks through the usage of [[spawn egg]]s.
