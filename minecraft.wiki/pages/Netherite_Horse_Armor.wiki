'''Netherite horse armor''' is the strongest [[tier]] of [[horse armor]].

== Usage ==
Only adult [[horse]]s and [[zombie horse]]s can wear netherite horse armor; baby horses, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, and [[skeleton horse]]s cannot be equipped with armor.

=== Equipping ===
Netherite horse armor can be equipped to a horse either by manually placing it in its respective slot ({{SlotSprite|Horse Armor}}) in the horse’s inventory, or by pressing [[control|Use]] on the horse while holding it.

The netherite horse armor can be removed either by manually removing it from the armor slot or by using [[shears]] on the horse.

=== Protection ===
When equipped, netherite horse armor gives {{armor|19}} [[armor point]]s, 3 armor toughness and 1 (10%) [[knockback resistance]].

Horse armor protects [[zombie horse]]s from burning in sunlight.

If a horse dies while equipped with netherite horse armor, it drops its normal loot, a [[saddle]] (if it had one), and the horse armor.

=== Durability ===
Unlike player armor or wolf armor, horse armor does not have [[durability]]. This means a single netherite horse armor can be used infinitely unless it is destroyed through other means.

=== Enchanting ===
Unlike player armor, horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, {{in|java}} Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an [[anvil]] to enchant with [[Thorns]], [[Feather Falling]], [[Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Blast Protection]], [[Curse of Binding]], and [[Curse of Vanishing]]. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.
