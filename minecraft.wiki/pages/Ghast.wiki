'''Ghasts''' are large, floating, [[ghost]]-like hostile mobs found in [[the Nether]], and are the only source of [[ghast tear]]s. Ghasts wander aimlessly and shoot explosive [[fireball]]s at [[player]]s, which can be hit back to kill them instantly upon direct impact.

== Spawning ==
To spawn naturally, a ghast requires a solid [[block]] below it and a free space 5×5 blocks wide and 4 blocks high. They spawn in the [[basalt deltas]], [[Nether wastes]], and [[soul sand valley]] biomes in any light level. {{IN|Java}}, ghasts cannot spawn in soul sand valleys if another ghast is within 16 blocks of spherical distance to the intended spawning location. {{iN|Bedrock}}, two ghasts can spawn within any 4 [[chunk]] span.

{{IN|Java}}, ghasts spawn in groups of 4 at both [[Nether wastes]] and [[soul sand valley]]s while they spawn individually in [[basalt deltas]]. {{IN|Bedrock}}, ghasts will always spawn individually.

Ghasts do not spawn in [[Nether fortress]]es, but they can wander nearby. They can, however, spawn in the treasure room variant of [[bastion remnant]]s if the room is in the correct [[biome]].

== Behavior ==
Ghasts float around with their eyes and mouth closed and periodically make crying sounds heard from up to 80 blocks away. They have a [[hitbox]] of 4×4×4 blocks. The ghast's nine tentacles are not within their hitbox.

When within range, a ghast faces the player and shoots a [[fireball]] every 3 seconds, opening its eyes and mouth and making a screeching sound. They strafe left to right in the air while targeting. A ghast requires a line of sight to the player before firing, which can be blocked by any solid block, including transparent blocks. {{IN|Java}}, they target players within 64 blocks horizontally and 4 blocks vertically<ref name="MC-49640">{{bug|MC-49640||Ghasts don't aggro unless you're at the exact same height they are flying|WAI}}</ref>, and continue attacking as long as they are within a 64 block sphere and have line of sight. {{IN|Bedrock}}, a ghast normally targets a player within a sphere of 28 blocks, increasing to 64 blocks if the player damages it. {{IN|be}}, a ghast holds its charge like a [[pillager]] when it loses sight of its target and shoots again instantly when in range.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-45311||Ghast holding onto its fire charge till the player re-enters it’s vicinity.}}</ref>

Ghasts do not attempt to approach the player once aggravated, but instead fire at the player from their position within firing range. If a ghast is within close range to its target, it may take damage from the [[explosion]] of its own fireball, regardless of the player hitting the fireball back.

Ghasts can provoke other mobs into targeting them, but {{in|JE}} they do not target other mobs, only the player.

Ghasts are immune to [[fire]] and [[lava]] damage. They are slowed by lava, occasionally sinking into it or passing through lava falls, immobilizing them and making them more vulnerable to ranged attacks for some time. [[Splash potion]]s affect ghasts if the potion hits on their lower half.

Despite their ghostly appearance, ghasts are not considered [[undead]] mobs.<ref>{{bug|MC-190140||Ghasts are not considered undead mob|Invalid}}</ref> This means they can drown,<ref>{{bug|MC-238622||Ghasts can drown|WAI}}</ref> are damaged by [[Instant Damage]]<ref>{{bug|MC-200929||Ghast are harmed with potion of harming|WAI}}</ref> and healed by [[Instant Health]], are affected by [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]],<ref>{{bug|MC-238623||Ghasts are affected by the poison effect|WAI}}</ref> and are not affected by [[Smite]].<ref>{{bug|MC-200937||Ghast are not affected with the smite enchantment|WAI}}</ref> Despite this, [[wither]]s never deliberately target them<ref>{{bug|MC-162557||Withers no longer attack ghasts|WAI}}</ref>, making them the only non-undead mob ignored by withers (excluding [[agent]]s{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}}, and mobs with the <code>invulnerable</code> NBT tag). They are also completely ignored by [[wolves]], "Johnny" [[vindicator]]s, [[goat]]s, [[snow golem]]s, trusting [[fox]]es, and [[zoglin]]s. However, [[iron golem]]s and [[warden]]s attack ghasts, and ghasts do not retaliate.{{only|je}}<ref>{{bug|MC-250234||A ghast which is attacked by another monster doesn't attack the monster|WAI}}</ref>

Despite being flying mobs, ghasts can destroy [[turtle egg]]s when on top of them.<ref>{{bug|MC-248332||Bees, ghasts, phantoms, and allays can destroy turtle eggs}}</ref>

When targeting, the red eyes and mouth of a ghast appears more glowing in ''Bedrock Edition''. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], this texture actually glows.

=== Fireball ===
{{main|Fireball}}

Ghasts shoot fireballs at players, dealing damage to [[entities]] and creating an explosion that sets fire to nearby blocks upon impact. Blocks with [[blast resistance]] as low as 3.5 survive a fireball's explosion, the explosion itself does no damage unless it hits the [[entities]] directly.

Hitting a fireball with another projectile or a melee attack deflects it, dealing {{hp|1000}} damage to any ghast hit directly by it, killing them.

All other [[mob]]s retaliate to the [[player]] instead of the ghast if they are hit by a deflected fireball.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|-happy|-ghastling}}

== Trivia ==
* In English, "[[wiktionary:ghast|ghast]]" is an archaic word meaning "ghastly".<ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ghast</ref> {{w|H. P. Lovecraft}} first coined its use as the name for a monster (a vaguely humanoid one, in ''{{w|The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath}}''), but "ghasts" have appeared in many other fantasy stories and games.
* Ghasts are considered to be fire-breathing [[ghost]]s in their [[Meet the Mob]] [[Minecraft.net]] article.<ref name="meet ghast">{{Mcnet|meet-ghast|Meet the Ghast|May 22, 2017|Tom Stone|archive-url|archive-time|url-prefix}}</ref>
** In their [[Mob Menagerie]] article, ghasts were said to be "large, incorporeal beings" whose origins are unclear. The article states that "they tend to avoid the [[Crimson Forest|fungal forests]] where it's harder to track their prey". They are also "immune to heat damage" because they have "spent so long in the Nether" that "they love the warmth of lava."<ref name="2024ghast">{{Mcnet|ghast|Mob Menagerie: Ghast|January 4, 2024|Duncan Greere|archive-url|archive-time|url-prefix}}</ref>
** Alternatively, the [[Minecraft: Mobestiary]], their {{AMCM|Ghast|appearance}} in {{AMCM}}, and later merchandise portray ghasts as organic beings with a stomach system resembling a cannon.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://minecraftshop.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/minecraft-ghast-skeleton-unisex-comfort-colors-t-shirt|title=Minecraft Ghast Skeleton Unisex Comfort Colors T-Shirt|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref>
* The player can go inside of a ghast by falling through the top of it or flying (or jumping while attacking) up underneath it. If the player stands on top of the head, the player sees inside of it.
* If a ghast is trapped in a 1-thick cube, it shoots fireballs through the cube. This is because all mobs that shoot spawn the projectile one block in front of it to prevent the projectile from hitting the mob.
* On rare occasions, ghasts spawn in such a way as to see through blocks (usually trapped on all sides in a tight area). When this happens and the ghast has a "line of sight" through those blocks, it launches a fireball in the player's direction. This is reminiscent of a [[blaze]] but with explosive addition.
* [[C418]] revealed in an AMA on [https://www.reddit.com/ Reddit] that ghast sounds are taken from his pet cat, who makes them when disturbed while sleeping.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nbe2h/i_am_the_composer_and_sound_designer_of_minecraft/c37sjyb</ref>
* Two ghasts are featured in the LEGO set "Minecraft Micro World - The Nether", along with a [[zombified piglin]].
* There is an unused ghast sound called {{Sound|"affectionatescream.ogg"|Ghast affectionate scream.ogg}} in the game files. It can be heard in the last scene of the [[Nether Update]] [[Nether Update: Official Trailer|trailer]] and during the elytra chase scene of {{AMCM}}.
* Ghasts use different models between the ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition'', and some of their tentacles are different lengths.
* To distinguish them from the happy ghasts and dried ghasts, this mob has been referred to as "angry Ghast"<ref> {{Mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-21-6|Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.6|June 17, 2025|Java Team|archive-url|archive-time|url-prefix}}</ref>
