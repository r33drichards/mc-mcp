'''15w31c''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on July 31, 2015<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150811074811/https://www.mojang.com/2015/07/minecraft-snapshot-15w31a/ Minecraft snapshot 15w31c], Mojang.com (archived August 11, 2015)</ref> to fix some bugs and crashes from [[15w31a]] and [[15w31b]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Dirt Path JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Dirt Path|Grass Path]]'''
* The collision height has been changed to {{frac|15|16}} of a block.

=== Items ===
'''Models for chest-like blocks'''
* [[Chest]]s, [[trapped chest]]s, and [[ender chest]]s were reverted back, to be consistent with the rest of blocks.
** It is believed the previous change was made to make it easier to distinguish between regular and trapped chests.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Ender Dragon.gif|width=100x100]] '''[[Ender Dragon]]'''
* No longer produces any more [[Dragon egg|eggs]].

=== World generation ===
'''{{BiomeLink|Nether Wastes|The Nether}}'''
* Re-added the nether fog.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Offhand slot'''
* Can now stack whatever item the player is holding by picking them from the ground.

'''[[Status effect]]s'''
* The [[Levitation]] effect no longer overrides the fall damage reduction of the Jump Boost effect.
