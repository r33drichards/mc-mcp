'''19w37a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.15]], released on September 11, 2019,<ref name="19w37a">{{snap|19w37a|September 11, 2019}}</ref> which adds some more features originally from {{BE}}.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Campfire]]s'''
* Can now be extinguished with a [[shovel]].

'''[[Farmland]]'''
* [[Block]]s that can be manually {{ctrl|placed}} on [[farmland]] without turning it into [[dirt]] can now also be pushed into it by a [[piston]] without turning the farmland under the block the piston has pushed into dirt.

'''[[Large fern]]s'''
* Now drop [[wheat seeds]].<ref>{{bug|MC-160123}}</ref>

=== Items ===
'''[[Boat]]s'''
* When used as [[fuel]], one boat now smelts 6 [[item]]s in a [[furnace]], [[blast furnace]], or [[smoker]] instead of 1.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Mob spawning]]'''
* 5% of [[cow]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, and [[chicken]]s spawn as babies.
* 10% of [[wolves]], [[llama]]s, and [[horse]]s spawn as babies.

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* [[Item]] predicate in advancements now makes a distinction between actual [[enchantment]]s and stored enchantments, like ones stored in [[enchanted book]]s.
** <code>stored_enchantments</code> is used to match stored enchantments.
