A '''frozen river''' is an ice topped variant of the [[river]] that replaces it in cold regions.

== Description ==
In a frozen river biome, the water is completely covered in a layer of [[ice]]. Riverbeds consist of [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]], and [[clay]], and are one of the few places where clay generates, alongside [[Lake (disambiguation)|lakes]], [[swamp|swamps]], [[lush caves]] and in the shallow variants of [[Frozen Ocean|frozen]], [[Cold Ocean|cold]] and [[Lukewarm Ocean|lukewarm]] [[oceans]], as well as normal [[Ocean|oceans]]. [[Seagrass]] does not generate on the riverbed. While [[sugar cane]] can generate alongside a frozen riverbank, it often uproots itself after generation due to the water being frozen. [[Oak|Oak trees]] and grass can still generate here if this biome generates on land. Sometimes, frozen rivers can generate next to regular [[taiga]] biomes, as these are able to generate in the same temperature range as frozen rivers.<ref>{{bug|MC-239444||Frozen rivers can generate in the middle of taiga biomes|WAI}}</ref>

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], frozen rivers use default environmental settings with a strong cold color grading, making the biome appear colder blue.

== Mobs ==
[[Stray|Strays]], a variant of [[Skeleton|skeletons]] can spawn here{{only|be|short=true}}. In ''Bedrock Edition'', like some other cold biomes, only strays, skeletons and [[slime]]s can spawn as well as [[drowned]]. [[Salmon]] spawn in the water here. {{IN|je}}, no land based [[passive mobs]] spawn. {{IN|be}} however, [[rabbit]]s and [[polar bear]]s spawn on land here.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
