A '''spawn egg''' is an [[item]] used to spawn [[mob]]s directly.

== Obtaining ==
Spawn eggs can be obtained only in [[Creative]] mode or using [[commands]]. In Creative mode, the [[player]] can press {{control|pick block}} on an existing mob to obtain their respective egg. {{IN|java}}, spawn eggs have their own tab in the [[Creative inventory]], while {{In|bedrock}}, they are grouped at the bottom of the Nature tab. There are 87 spawn eggs in ''Java Edition'' and 89 spawn eggs in ''Bedrock Edition''.

[[Wither]] and [[ender dragon]] spawn eggs can only be obtained with commands such as {{Cmd|give @s ender_dragon_spawn_egg}}. In ''Bedrock Edition'', the agent and NPC spawn eggs may be obtained with an alias ID (see the [[Spawn Egg#Data values|table]] below), <code>spawn_egg ''amount'' 56</code> and <code>spawn_egg ''amount'' 51</code> respectively. Invalid alias IDs yield a generic <code>item.spawn_egg.name</code> instead, which uses the old chicken spawn egg texture and has no effect.

== Usage ==
A spawn egg is used by pressing {{control|use}} on any surface (top, bottom, or side) with the egg. When used on a top surface, the egg's [[mob]] appears with its feet immediately adjacent to the surface, and its ambient sound is played.

Spawn eggs are not thrown (unlike normal [[egg]]s); the player must be within normal range of the block to use the spawn egg. All monster mobs (except [[undead]] animals, [[shulker]]s, [[piglin]]s, [[hoglin]]s and [[ender dragon]]s) spawned while on Peaceful difficulty get created and immediately deleted from the world.

The surfaces of blocks are prioritized for spawning; if none are within reach, mobs can also be spawned in [[water]] or [[lava]] sources.

=== Dispensers ===
A spawn egg fired from a [[dispenser]] spawns the [[mob]] directly in front of the dispenser. The spawn egg is consumed when fired.

=== Baby mobs ===
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
{{in development|be||26.0|section=1}}
If the [[player]] {{control|uses}} a spawn egg on the type of [[mob]] it spawns, and that mob has a baby form (except for [[camel husks]]), the egg spawns a baby version of the mob. For instance, using a sheep spawn egg on a [[sheep]] makes a baby sheep with the same wool color.

=== Monster spawners ===
All spawn eggs can also be {{Control|used}} on a [[monster spawner]] or [[trial spawner]] to change the [[mob]] that spawns. {{IN|bedrock}}, spawn eggs for any of the fish mobs spawn them only if the monster spawner is [[waterlog]]ged.

=== Renaming ===
A spawn egg can be renamed on an [[anvil]], and when used it spawns a [[mob]] with that name appearing over its head, similar to a mob that has been named with a [[name tag]]. Unlike a name tag, this method of naming does not prevent [[hostile mob]]s from despawning. The mob's name can be seen only by aiming at the mob from four or fewer blocks away. This name also appears in [[death messages]] from the mob killing a [[player]].

Certain names have special effects on mobs, and so a spawn egg with the name will spawn a mob with the effect. A [[rabbit]] spawn egg named "Toast" will spawn a rabbit with the secret skin. A spawn egg named "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" spawns a mob that appears upside down. A [[vindicator]] from a spawn egg named "Johnny" acts hostile to all mobs except for other illagers. A [[sheep]] from a spawn egg named "jeb_" appears to change colors over time; this doesn't affect the color of the wool the sheep drops.

=== Survival mode ===
Players in [[Survival]] mode can use spawn eggs normally, though spawn eggs are [[Content inaccessible in Survival|not obtainable in Survival]]. They can be obtained only using the Creative menu or commands. Just like other items, spawn eggs are consumed when used in Survival mode.

== List of spawn eggs ==
There is a spawn egg for almost every mob in the game; exceptions are listed below this table. The spawn eggs are thematically sorted in the creative inventory in different categories. The categories do not affect actual [[mob type]] classifications.

Depending on the mob, spawn eggs appear as one of three sizes: small, medium or large. The spawn egg’s size is purely a visual effect and does not affect its functionality.

=== Item data ===
When using commands to give a player a spawn egg there is an option to add custom data to said item to spawn a different mob than is normally expected i.e /give @p villager_spawn_egg[entity_data={id:"minecraft:cat"}] 1 which will take a normal villager spawn egg and turn it into a cat spawn egg.

{{JE}}:
{{see also|Data component format}}
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|components}}: the item's '''components''' tag.
{{:Data component format/entity_data}}
</div>

{{BE}}:
: {{IN|bedrock}}, spawn eggs have no additional tags.
