A '''stone sword''' is a variant of [[sword]] crafted from [[cobblestone]], [[blackstone]], or [[cobbled deepslate]]. It is the fifth-highest [[tier]] of sword, dealing the same damage as a [[copper sword]] but having less durability.

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
Stone swords are crafted with a [[stick]] and any combination of two [[cobblestone]], [[blackstone]], or [[cobbled deepslate]] (i.e. 2 cobblestone, or 1 blackstone + 1 cobbled deepslate, etc.). <!-- Imo this line is not needed at all, this is explained by the description in crafting template-->

=== Mob loot ===
{{Main|Drops#Equipped items}}

Wither skeletons can spawn with a stone sword and have an 8.5% chance of dropping them upon death caused by player. This chance is increased by 1% per level of [[Looting]], up to a maximum of 11.5% with Looting III. The dropped sword is usually badly damaged.

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
{{main|Sword#Breaking}}
A sword can also be used to destroy certain blocks 50% quicker, sometimes much quicker than with fists. Using a sword to destroy any block that doesn't break instantly by hand decreases its durability by 2; this includes [[bamboo]], despite that the sword is the fastest tool for breaking it.<ref>{{bug|MC-195168||Swords consume double durability than they normally would when destroying bamboo saplings, bamboo, or cobwebs}}</ref>

If a sword is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], either using [[Creative]] or [[commands]], [[cobweb]]s hit by the sword drop the cobwebs themselves instead of the usual [[string]], because a sword is classified as the proper tool for cobwebs.

=== Attacking ===
{{main|Sword#Attacking}}

Pressing {{control|attack}} while holding an stone sword inflicts damage on both mobs and other players. Upon damaging a mob or player, the stone sword's [[durability]] decreases by 1.

Attacking a [[boat]] or a [[minecart]] with an stone sword instantly destroys it {{only|java}}, without decreasing the sword's durability.

{{IN|java}}, stone swords deal {{hp|5}} base damage, have an attack speed of 1.6 and take {{convert|12|game tick|second}} to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]]. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, stone swords have no attack cooldown or sweep attack, and deal {{hp|6}} base damage.

The damage that an stone sword enchanted with [[Sharpness]] V does on a non-critical hit is 8 {{in|java}} and 12.25 {{in|bedrock}}.

==== Creative mode ====
In Creative mode, swords are unable to break blocks. However, they can still break placed entities such as [[minecart]]s, [[painting]]s, [[item frame]]s,{{only|java}} and [[armor stand]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-27140}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-18463}}</ref>

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
{{Crafting

|Output=Stone Sword

|description=The durability of the two swords is added together, plus extra 6 points of durability.

{{Grinding

|ingredients=2x Damaged Stone Sword

|description=The durability of the two swords is added together, plus extra 6 points of durability.
}}
Two stone swords can be combined in an anvil. This preserves all enchantments on the sword, unlike using a crafting table or grindstone.

==== Anvil repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
| head=1
| Damaged Stone Sword
| Damaged Stone Sword; Cobblestone; Blackstone
| Stone Sword
| tail=1
}}
A stone sword can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by using cobblestone, blackstone or cobbled deepslate as the 2nd ingredient. Each material restores 25% of the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Using an anvil to repair leaves all of the sword's enchantments on it.

=== Enchantments ===
A stone sword can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

== Trivia ==
*The sword's traditional [[texture]] came from [[Notch]]'s abandoned RPG, ''[[Legend of the Chambered]]''. The iron sword's texture was created first, as it was from the game, and the other swords, including stone swords, followed.
