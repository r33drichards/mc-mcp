'''''Battle Frogs''''' is a metroidvania game made by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Bundle Mojam 2]] game jam.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes the role of Oui, who is implied to be woken up from a cryochamber on a spaceship to fight off a raid by space pirates, who are giant frogs in stereotypical pirate gear. In the top left corner, there's a baguette, which is the player's health bar. The first task is to find a weapon, the cheese launcher, while avoiding the pirates. The player must then disable a broken reactor, using the pirates to neutralize its radiation by making them absorb it, and fight off the resulting mutations.

Health can be restored by eating a croissant - only one can be found in the entire playthrough.

=== Controls ===

The game is played using a keyboard.
