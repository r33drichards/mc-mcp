{{Q|I don't know about dogs though...|C418|bandcamp.com}}

'''"Dog"''' is a song composed by [[C418]] that plays as part of an extension with the [[music disc]] "[[Music Disc cat|cat]]" on {{el|console}}.

== Track description ==
"Dog" continues off from where "cat" ends, using the same composition and melody of "cat", but with more focus on the chiptune-like synths.

"Dog" can only be heard on {{el|console}} once the music disc "cat" fades out. It plays for an extra two minutes, making the {{el|console}} version of "cat" the longest music disc in the game.

The album version fades into "[[Danny]]".
