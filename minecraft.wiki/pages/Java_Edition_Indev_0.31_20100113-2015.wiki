A variant of the January 13, 2010<ref group="note">Release time of this version is unknown, because Notch didn't announced it in IRC chat nor on TWoN and only one known screenshot of this version is posted after next version release</ref>, version of Indev 0.31 was released with [[Creative]] mode enabled.<ref>[https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/796501-finite-water-today#c20  Minecraft Forums] - "Notch turned off the health for a little time and i managed to get on the bottom on the floating islands alive."</ref> There are a few bugs with this version due to some Creative mode code that was broken by the time this version came out; for example, blocks are not infinite.
