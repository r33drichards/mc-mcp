'''Mob C''', or "'''The Great Hunger'''" was a proposed [[mob]] featured in the [[2017 Mob Vote|Mob Vote]] during [[MINECON Earth 2017]], alongside the [[barnacle]], the [[phantom]] and the [[wildfire]].<ref>{{mcnet|announcing-minecon-earth|Announcing... MINECON Earth|August 8, 2017|Owen Jones}}</ref>

It was a lizard-like creature that sinks into the ground, camouflages itself and consumes mobs and items with its huge mouth. It has a "great appetite for enchanting powers" and Jeb says that viewers should vote for Mob C because players may be able to use the mob's abilities to add or remove enchantments for players' own items.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|930797685497622528|MINECON Earth's Mob Vote approaches!

The great hunger received 26% of the votes in the first round and moved onto the second,<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|931937794951348224|Three mobs remain but only one gets added to the game!
