'''Planks''' are common [[block]]s used as building blocks and in [[crafting]] recipes. They are usually one of the first things that a [[player]] crafts in [[Survival]] mode. There are currently twelve variants of planks, which can be differentiated into three categories: '''Overworld planks''' made from [[tree]] logs, '''bamboo planks''' made from [[blocks of bamboo]], and nonflammable '''Nether planks''' made from [[huge fungus]] stems.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Planks can be broken by hand, but using an [[axe]] speeds up the process.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Planks|Axe}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{BlockSprite|Oak Planks|text=Oak planks}} generate as part of:
* [[Mineshaft]]s, where they are used as beams supported by oak [[fence]]s and as a platform where [[air]] is beneath.
* [[Plains]] [[village]]s, where they are used for various structures including walls, roofs, and floors of many buildings, as well as paths over [[water]].
* [[Stronghold]]s, where they are used for floors and pillars in the library and storage rooms.
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s

{{BlockSprite|Spruce Planks|text=Spruce planks}} generate as part of: 
* [[Swamp hut]]s, where they are used as a primary building material.
* [[Taiga]] and [[snowy tundra|snowy]] [[village]]s, as a part of several buildings, with additional [[snowy taiga]] villages {{in|BE}}.
* [[Ocean ruins]]
* [[Shipwreck]]s

{{BlockSprite|Birch Planks|text=Birch planks}} generate as part of: 
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Shipwreck]]s
* [[Pillager outpost]]s

{{BlockSprite|Jungle Planks|text=Jungle planks}} generate as part of [[shipwreck]]s.

{{BlockSprite|Acacia Planks|text=Acacia planks}} generate as part of: 
* [[Savanna]] villages
* [[Shipwreck]]s{{only|BE|short=1}}

{{BlockSprite|Dark Oak Planks|text=Dark oak planks}} generate as part of: 
* [[Mineshaft]]s generated in [[badlands]] biomes
* [[Woodland mansion]]s
* [[Ocean ruins]]
* [[Shipwreck]]s
* [[Pillager outpost]]s
* [[Ancient cities]]

Mangrove, pale oak, crimson, warped, cherry and bamboo planks don't generate naturally.

== Usage ==
Planks can be used to build structures, craft ingredients, or as fuel for smelting. Crimson planks and warped planks, however, cannot be used as fuel; the player has to convert them into tools, sticks, or other things.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Planks are used in many crafting recipes. [[Stairs]], [[slab]]s, [[fence]]s, [[fence gate]]s, [[door]]s, [[trapdoor]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, [[button]]s, [[sign]]s, and [[boat]]s must be crafted from planks of the same type, and the crafted result depends on the type used. For other products, planks of different types can be mixed freely and the wood types in the product is indeterminate. Crimson and warped planks cannot be used to make boats.<ref>{{bug|MC-170868|||Invalid}}</ref>
{{crafting usage|Any Planks, Matching Planks}}

=== Fuel ===
[[Overworld]] planks can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, [[smelting]] 1.5 [[item]]s per [[block]].

[[Nether]] planks (crimson and warped planks) cannot be used as [[fuel]], although they can be crafted into sticks, which can be used as fuel.

=== Repairing ===
Planks are the repair items for the wood [[tier]], and thus can be used to [[repair]] the following items in an [[anvil]]: 
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Sword}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Pickaxe}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Axe}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Hoe}}
* {{ItemLink|Wooden Spear}}
* {{ItemLink|Shield}}

== Trivia ==
* To craft each recipe once, a player would need 152 planks, including 10 for the recipes that require [[sticks]], and 6 for wooden [[slabs]]. To craft all the other 10 wood variants of all recipes, the player would need an extra 384 planks, plus another 36 planks for the 72 sticks needed to make the [[fence]], [[fence gate]], and [[sign]] variants, adding up to a total of 572 planks.
