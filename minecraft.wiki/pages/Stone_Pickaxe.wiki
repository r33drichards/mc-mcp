A '''stone pickaxe''' is a variant of [[pickaxe]] that is crafted from [[cobblestone]]. It is the fifth-highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, and attack damage than a [[wooden pickaxe]]. It has a [[mining level]] of 1, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[copper ore]], [[iron ore]], and [[lapis lazuli ore]].

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
A stone pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a stone pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s.

==== Mining level ====
Stone pickaxes have a mining level of 1. A stone pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:
* {{BlockLink|Iron Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Copper Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Lapis Lazuli Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Iron Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Copper Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Lapis Lazuli Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Copper}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Raw Copper}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Iron}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Raw Iron}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Lapis Lazuli}}
* {{BlockLink|Cut Copper}}
* {{BlockLink|Cut Copper Slab}}
* {{BlockLink|Cut Copper Stairs}}
* {{BlockLink|Lightning Rod}}

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to [[recover]]. Stone pickaxes do {{hp|3}} damage per attack, or 3.6 damage per second.

==== {{BE}} ====
All pickaxes attack instantly, with stone pickaxes doing {{hp|4}} damage per attack.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

==== Anvil repair ====

}}

A stone pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[cobblestone]], [[cobbled deepslate]], or [[blackstone]], with each block restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two stone pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A stone pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
