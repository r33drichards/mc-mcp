'''Sculk''' may refer to:

== ''Minecraft'' ==

=== Blocks ===
* {{BlockLink|Sculk}}, a block found abundantly in the deep dark. Drops 1 experience.
* {{BlockLink|Sculk Catalyst}}, a block that converts blocks around it to blocks in the sculk family (except for more sculk catalysts) when a mob that drops experience dies nearby. Drops 5 experience.
* {{BlockLink|Sculk Sensor}}, a block that detects vibrations and outputs a [[Redstone Dust|redstone]] signal as well as triggering nearby sculk shriekers. Drops 5 experience.
** {{BlockLink|Calibrated Sculk Sensor}}, a variant of the sculk sensor that can be set to react to only a specific type of vibration.
* {{BlockLink|Sculk Shrieker}}, a block that "shrieks" if a player stands on it or triggers a nearby sculk sensor. This shrieking may cause the emergence of a [[warden]], if the sculk shrieker in question was created at world generation. Drops 5 experience.
* {{BlockLink|Sculk Vein}}, a non-solid block found in the deep dark, and the only one that does not drop experience when broken.

=== Mobs ===
* {{EntityLink|Warden}}, a hostile mob that emerges with the fourth activation of a natural sculk shrieker. Has the highest [[health]] and melee [[damage]] of all naturally spawning mobs, and can attack with ranged piercing sonic boom attacks if necessary. However, it is completely blind and relies on vibrations, smell and touch to identify players and mobs to attack.
