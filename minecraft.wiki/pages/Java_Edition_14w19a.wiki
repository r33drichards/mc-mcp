'''14w19a''' is the twenty-second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on May 8, 2014.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425132002/https://mojang.com/2014/05/minecraft-snapshot-14w19a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w19a|date=May 8, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Piston]]s & [[slime block]]s'''
* Slime blocks can now push entities sideways and downwards when attached to a piston.
** When they are on the ground, entities are pushed less.

=== World generation ===
'''[[World border]]'''
* The '''warning''', a red-colored aura seen when within a certain distance of the world border.
** Only visible on "Fancy" graphics.
** Outside the border, the warning is at full strength.
** Inside the border, the warning gradually gets stronger as the player approaches the border.
** If the border is stationary, the warning is first seen as the player passes the warning distance, default 5 blocks from the player's location.
** If the border is shrinking quickly enough, the warning is first visible at the warning time, default 15 seconds from the player's location.
* New options:
** {{cmd|worldborder damage <buffer<nowiki>|</nowiki>amount>}}
*** <code>buffer</code> (default 5) is the distance (in blocks) into the barrier before a player starts to become damaged.
*** <code>amount</code> (default 0.2) is the amount (per block) of damage a player takes, for each block-distance the player is past the barrier's buffer.
** {{cmd|worldborder warning <time<nowiki>|</nowiki>distance>}}
*** <code>time</code> (default 15) is the advance notice given (in seconds) to a player, using the red warning, that a shrinking world border is approaching their location.
*** <code>distance</code> (default 5) is the distance (in blocks) at which the red warning starts to appear, as a player approaches the barrier.
* The border in [[the Nether]] is now the same size as that of the [[Overworld]].
* Traveling to the Nether now doesn't create new portals outside the boundary.
** It is still possible to emerge at an existing portal outside the boundary.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Spectator]] mode'''
* Spectators now have a UI to teleport to other players.
** Activated by mouse middle-click, or pressing a number key.
* When more than 8 players are available to choose, the sides are replaced by arrows.
* When teams are set up, teams can be selected individually to only display that team's players.
* Both number keys and the 'pick block'-button together with the scroll wheel can be used to control the interface.
* Teleportation works across dimensions.
** "Far from complete".
