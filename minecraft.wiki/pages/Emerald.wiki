'''Emeralds''' are minerals that are used primarily as the currency for [[trading]] with [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mining ===
[[Emerald ore]] drops one emerald when mined using an [[iron pickaxe]] or better. If the pickaxe is enchanted with [[Fortune]], it may drop an extra emerald per level of Fortune, up to a maximum of 4 emeralds with Fortune III. If the ore is mined using a pickaxe enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], it drops itself in ore form instead of as an emerald.

=== Crafting ===

|Output= Emerald,9
|type= Material

=== Smelting ===

=== Trading ===
Emeralds can be obtained by [[trading]] with [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s, since they are the currency that villagers use for trading. Villagers and wandering traders buy various goods in return for emeralds. Trading is typically a faster way to obtain emeralds than by mining, as an emerald ore is rarer than a diamond ore.

[[Fox]]es that are holding emeralds also have a chance of 100% to drop the emerald they are holding upon death. Alternatively, the player can drop a food item to entice the fox to drop the emerald without killing it.

=== Generated loot ===
{{see also|Emerald Ore#Natural generation}}
Emeralds can generate in [[chest]]s in some [[village]] houses or other [[generated structure]]s.

== Usage ==

=== Beacons ===
Emeralds can be used to select powers from a [[beacon]]. The player must select one of the available powers and then insert an emerald into the item slot. 

An emerald can be substituted for an [[iron ingot]], a [[gold ingot]], a [[diamond]] or a [[netherite ingot]] in a beacon.
