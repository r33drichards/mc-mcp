=== Block data ===
A potato sign has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

{{see also|Block entity format}}
<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
** {{nbt|byte|is_waxed}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the text is locked with [[honeycomb]].
** {{nbt|compound|front_text}}: A compound that discribes front text.
*** {{nbt|byte|has_glowing_text}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the sign has been dyed with a [[glow ink sac]].
*** {{nbt|string|color}}: The color that has been used to dye the sign. The default value is {{cd|black}} One of {{cd|d=and|white|orange|magenta|light_blue|yellow|lime|pink|gray|light_gray|cyan|purple|blue|brown|green|red|black}}.
*** {{nbt|list|filtered_messages}}: Only in [[Realms]]. The lines of text shown to players with the profanity filter turned on instead of the regular lines. This tag is automatically set to {{code|""}} for lines containing blocked words and to the line's normal contents for the other lines when a player with the profanity filter turned ''off'' edits the sign, so players with the filter ''on'' cannot see the blocked words. If a player with the filter ''on'' tries to use blocked words in one or more lines, the line(s) in {{nbt|list|messages}} containing blocked words are set to {{code|""}}, which makes them render completely blank, and this tag is also given the same contents. If multiple lines have been edited before the sign editing GUI is closed, only the lines containing blocked words are blanked.
*** {{nbt|list|messages}}: A list of text for each line.
**** {{nbt|string}}: Text for each line. Must be [[Raw JSON text format]]. The character limit for the Text tags depends on the width of the characters.
** {{nbt|compound|back_text}}: A compound that discribes back text.
*** The same structure as {{nbt|compound|front_text}}.
