{{outdated|In [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], this format has been replaced with the [[data component format]].|edition=java}}

[[Item]]s are used both in the [[Player.dat format|player's inventory]] and ender chest, in container [[Block entity format|block entities]], in some [[Entity format|item entities]], and in [[structure file]]s.

== NBT structure ==
Items are stored in the [[NBT format]]. Sometimes a {{nbt|byte|Slot}} tag is used to specify the slot the item is in, such as with chests; other times there is no {{nbt|byte|Slot}} tag, such as with dropped items.
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag.
** {{nbt|byte|Count}}: Number of [[Item|items]] stacked in this inventory slot. Any item can be stacked, even if unstackable through normal means. Values below 0 cause the item to be treated as air, resulting in the item being removed.
** {{nbt|byte|Slot}}: The inventory slot the item is in.
** {{nbt|string|id}}: [[Data values|Item/Block ID]]. If not specified, gets treated as air, resulting in the item being removed.
** {{nbt|compound|tag}}: Additional information about the item; see below. This tag is optional for most items. Unlike other entity or block NBT, this tag is never deserialized and can hold user defined tags that are not used by the game by standard.
</div>

=== Display Properties ===

All items can have custom display names and lore, as well as a custom model data. Various tooltips can also be hidden.
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|tag}}: Parent tag.
{{:Item_format/Display Properties}}
</div>

=== Attribute Modifiers ===

All items can be given [[Attribute#Modifiers|Modifiers]] which affect various [[Attribute]]s of the player or mob wearing or holding them. Note that if an item has default attribute modifiers, these cease to exist if this tag is added (e.g. a diamond sword given an empty '''AttributeModifiers''' list no longer provides a boost to damage). Also note that default attribute modifiers do not use this tag, and as such, it does not appear on a natural item.
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|tag}}: Parent tag.
{{:Item_format/Attribute Modifiers}}
</div>

=== Enchantments ===

There are two ways enchantments are associated with items; the first way is that the item is actually enchanted and the enchantment affects the behavior of the item, and the second way is that the item is an [[enchanted book]] which simply stores the enchantments without actually affecting the behavior of the item. There is also the '''RepairCost''' tag which tracks [[anvil]] usage for items, making them more costly with every use of the anvil.
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|tag}}: Parent tag.
{{:Item_format/Enchantments}}
</div>
'''StoredEnchantments''' tooltips are not displayed if edited onto an item other than an enchanted book. Enchantments stored in '''Enchantments''', however, are always displayed in the tooltip and cause the item to glow, even if they cannot have any effect.

=== Block Tags ===

All items can have specifications for [[Adventure]] mode, to describe which blocks may be broken with them. Block items can also be given tags to specify what blocks they may be placed against in Adventure mode, and to specify what Tile Entity NBT tags to apply to them when placed.
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|tag}}: Parent tag
{{:Item_format/Block Tags}}
</div>

=== Durability ===

=== Potion Effects ===

[[Potion]]s, [[splash potion]]s, [[lingering potion]]s, and [[tipped arrow]]s can have multiple, customized effects via the <code>custom_potion_effects</code> tag. These effects are added to the default effect under the <code>Potion</code> tag if present. In addition the color can be overridden with the <code>CustomPotionColor</code> tag.
