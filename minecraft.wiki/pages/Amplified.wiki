[[File:Amplified Biome.png|thumb|300px|A typical amplified world.]]
'''Amplified''' (stylized as '''AMPLIFIED''' {{in|JE}}) is a [[world type]] that uses a larger range of [[altitude]] in [[Overworld]] [[terrain generation]], with terrain often exceeding Y=255 and occasionally even Y=320. [[The Nether]] and [[the End]] are not affected and generate normally.

[[File:AmplifiedNotice.png|right|250px]]
It is recommended for the player to have a relatively powerful (or "beefy", as said in the world type's description) computer to mitigate long loading times and intense lag spikes on amplified, as world generation uses a large amount of memory, CPU power, and other resources.

== Generation ==
Amplified worlds generate many large hills and mountains, which dwarf even the [[mountains]] biomes seen in default world types, and often reach the world height limit. Deep [[cavern]]s often reach down to the [[bedrock]] layer. Due to extremely steep cliffs and unforgiving terrain, unprepared players can find it quite difficult to survive in this world type. Certain biomes (e.g. [[ocean]]s and [[river]]s) may see no obvious change in height. [[Village]]s still generate in this world type regardless of the shape of the terrain underneath them, often causing the buildings to generate in bizarre ways.

Amplified terrain can also be generated on the ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' by selecting the "Amplified World" option when creating a new world, but as with the normal worlds in these editions, terrain only generates up to Y level 128. These worlds can be transferred to the respective console's version of {{el|be}}, though normal terrain will generate after the already-generated amplified terrain.

== Trivia ==
* This world generation can occasionally generate floating islands, which somewhat resemble the scrapped [[sky dimension]].
* The [[windswept savanna]] biome, even in the default world type, has an extreme landscape similar to amplified.
* This world type was made by complete accident, when [[Jens Bergensten]] messed up some coordinates.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|369401687938564097|Was testing level generator stuff, when @notch asked me to keep this as an option: http://i.imgur.com/DtYeEDO.jpg Really resource heavy, though!|August 19, 2013}}</ref>
