'''15w34a''' is the tenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on August 19, 2015.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/08/minecraft-snapshot-15w34a</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Added the <code>powered</code> and <code>conditional</code> byte tags to <code>Control</code> tile entity for [[command block]]s.
* Added the <code>life</code> (Integer) and <code>power</code> (List/Double) tags to <code>FireballBase</code>.
* Added the <code>id</code> string tag inside <code>SpawnData</code> for the <code>MobSpawner</code> tile entity.
* Added the <code>powered</code> byte tag to <code>Music</code> tile entity for [[note block]]s.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Repeating Command Block JE1.png; Impulse Command Block JE2.png; Chain Command Block JE1.png|32px}} [[Command block]]s'''
* New textures that now vary depending on what direction they are placed from, similar to [[dispenser]]s and [[piston]]s.
** It consists of a front, a back and a side texture (looks like arrows), so the orientation can be easily determined.
** The texture is animated - the colored "buttons" in the middle change color.
** The middle panel texture has a black outline.
* 3 modes: impulse, chain, and repeat - color changes based on mode.
** Impulse mode (orange): Command is run once on rising edge.
*** Same behavior and color as previous versions.
** Chain mode (green): Command is run whenever another command block pointing into it executes, and the command block in question is powered.
*** The chain signal is forwarded until the blocks get out of loaded [[chunk]]s.
*** The signal is independent of the powered state of any block in the chain, as well as the [[command]] (or lack thereof) inside.
** Repeat mode (blue): Command is run every game tick while powered.
*** Like a [[minecart with command block]] but faster.
** Each new mode has its own block id and is obtainable with {{cmd|give}} and {{control|pick block}}.
* Power received is now a data tag, allowing command blocks to have such a state under control, independent of any nearby [[redstone]] signal.
* Command block contraptions from earlier versions still work.
* The "Done" button is now always available to press, even when the command line is empty.

'''[[Note block]]s'''
* Their power state is controlled through a tag, and can, therefore, be controlled independently on any [[redstone]] signal.

=== Items ===
[[File:Map (item) JE1 BE1.png|left|32px]]
'''[[Map]]s'''
* Now start at a wider zoom level (1:4 instead of 1:1).
* New recipe for zooming in on a map: [[shears]] and a map together in any shape.
** Zooms in on the lower-right quadrant of the original map.
** This causes the shears to lose [[durability]].

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Zombified Piglin JE2.png|left|16px]]
'''[[Zombie]]s and [[zombie pigmen]]'''
* Now lift their arms slightly when becoming hostile.

=== Non-mob entities ===
[[File:Minecart with Command Block JE2.png|left|32px]]
'''[[Minecarts with command blocks]]'''
* The "Done" button is now always available to press, even when the command line is empty.

=== Command format ===
'''NBT format'''
* <code>EntityId</code> for the <code>MobSpawner</code> block entity has been deprecated.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Combat'''
* New attack speed combat mechanic.
** A meter shows up after switching items or attacking.
*** Damage done depends on the fullness of the meter.
*** Fills in 0.25s for non-weapons, 0.8s for [[sword]]s, [[pickaxe]]s, and [[shovel]]s, and 1.2s for [[axe]]s.
*** The meter can be displayed next to the hotbar (left or right based on the player's main hand), under the crosshair or turned off.
**** Looks like the icon for the {{EffectLink|id=strength-revision-1|Strength}} effect on the side of the hotbar, or like a dagger under the crosshair.
**** This is controlled in video [[settings]].
* Delay when selecting a sword, pickaxe, axe or shovel into the main hand.

=== General ===
'''Optimizations'''
* Optimized mob AI, pathfinding and block ticking.
** 15% tick speed increase on 16 render distance.
