This is a list of '''April Fools' Day jokes''' along with summaries of their features and changes.

== List of April Fools' jokes ==
=== 2010 ===
In 2010, [[Notch]] wrote that he had planned to make a video announcing "Minecraft 4D" for April Fools', but ran out of time due to moving into a new home.<ref>{{tweet|notch|11389547843|Stupid move cutting into my April fools time. I was going to announce minecraft in 4D.

=== 2011 ===
{{main|Minecraft Store}}
In 2011, a fake "Minecraft Store" website was created. This was linked to by the [[locked chest]], a block that was implemented for this purpose, as it was implied that keys had to be bought from said store to unlock these chests. It is heavily inspired by the Mann Co. Store from Team Fortress 2.

=== 2012 ===
[[File:Mars Effect.gif|thumb|left|The logo from the Mars Effect site.]]
In 2012, for April Fools', Notch created a hoax website for a new game entitled ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120402231307/http://marseffect.net/ Mars Effect.]''
<!-- Do not re-add this link. This post contains a link to an unarchived version of marseffect.net, which has become a casino website. 
<ref>{{tweet|notch|186155683677351937|Some information on my new game: http://marseffect.net|March 31, 2012}}</ref> 
-->
{{Q|After several weeks of trying to come up with a good name for the game, we finally decided not to learn from previous experiences and pick a name that's already kind of in use by a huge existing franchise. After playing around with names like "Elight", "Wind Commander", and "Steve Online", we finally settled on the very catchy name "Mars Effect".|Notch}}This was a joke referencing a recent lawsuit by Bethesda, developers of ''The Elder Scrolls'' franchise, regarding the name of the Mojang game ''[[Scrolls]]''.
This game was later revealed to be an actual upcoming game, entitled ''[[0x10c|0x10<sup>c</sup>]]'', though it was cancelled the following year, and never released.

=== 2013 ===
{{main|Java Edition 2.0}}

During 2013, Mojang released a pre-release for a fake future version of ''Minecraft'' containing numerous joke features to various YouTubers.<ref>{{citation|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130401191346/http://mojang.com/2013/04/its-finally-coming-minecraft-2-0/|title=It’s finally coming – Minecraft 2.0!|website=Mojang.com|author=Dinnerbone|date=April 1, 2013}}</ref>

=== 2014 ===
A post was added to Mojang Studios' blog<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401120035/https://mojang.com/2014/04/minecraft-is-experiencing-some-problems/|title=Minecraft is Experiencing Some Problems|website=Mojang.com|author=Jens Bergensten|date=April 1, 2014}}</ref> for the joke. 
{{Q|The long-nosed villagers introduced in Minecraft beta 1.9 have become sentient. They have taken over our skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN), so unfortunately you will not be able to change your skins until we fix the problem. We are desperately trying our best to pull the plugs, but we should prepare ourselves to serve under our new villager overlords. Singularity may be upon us.|The ''Minecraft'' Team}}

This caused all players' current skin to be replaced with the various villager skins, and caused users to be unable to change their skins unless they modified the [[launcher]] <code>.json</code> file. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused green robe of a nitwit villager.

In-game, villagers still acted the same, but they made different sounds. All noises were replaced with the sound effects of Element Animation's "T.E.A.V.S.R.P" (The Element Animation Villager Sounds Resource Pack). Mojang Studios also added in-game villager music. The title screen music contains a parody of the ''[[wikipedia:Game of Thrones|Game of Thrones]]'' theme, due to the new series starting in early April and also because of its being included in the original trailer for "T.E.A.V.S.R.P." Jeb also claimed the villager got his Twitter account.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|450891696289902592|They got to my twitter account too :S|April 1, 2014}}</ref>

Grumm [{{reddit|21xg55/due_to_popular_demand_i_present_you_the_villager|cghdzve}} released the villager skins on Reddit] on April 1, 2014. There were seven variants, including a base skin.

An updated version of T.E.A.V.S.R.P., complete with the new music, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141118054421/https://www.elementanimation.com/TEAVSRP2.zip was released by Element Animation] on April 2, 2014.

Soon afterward, Element Animation released [{{ytl|rmM1wl2XQiE}} this video], and on April 2, 2014, the skins and the sounds were reverted to the way they were before.

=== 2015 ===
{{main|Java Edition 15w14a}}
[[15w14a]] was released as an April Fools' joke for version [[Java Edition 1.10|1.10]], when the next update was supposed to be [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]]. This "update" is called the Love and Hugs Update.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401075342/https://mojang.com/2015/04/minecraft-snapshot-15w14a-the-love-and-hugs-update/|title=Minecraft snapshot 15w14a – The Love and Hugs Update|website=Mojang.com|author=Dinnerbone|date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> There was also a QR code written in the snow that generated in a [[superflat]] world that, when scanned, reads "Minecraft 1.9: The [[Combat Update]]". Swords were replaced with "hearts". The only world name available was "There can only be one". Survival was called "Existence". Players were also unable to take damage from the [[void]].

{{main|Java Edition 1.RV-Pre1}}
[[Java Edition 1.RV-Pre1|1.RV-Pre1]] was released as an April Fools' joke for the update 1.RV. This "update" was called the "Trendy Update".<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401063202/https://www.mojang.com/2016/03/minecraft-1rv-the-trendy-update-pre-release-1/|title=Minecraft 1.RV - The Trendy Update Pre-Release 1|website=Mojang.com|author=Jens Bergensten|date=March 31, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Mine & Craft Digital Leisure Device.png|thumb|The Mine & Craft Digital Leisure Device from April Fools 2017]]
The Mine & Craft Digital Leisure Device, a parody of Nintendo's [[wikipedia:Game & Watch series|Game & Watch]], was announced on the ''Minecraft'' website.<ref>{{Mcnet|introducing-mine-craft-digital-leisure-device|Introducing: The Mine & Craft Digital Leisure Device|April 1, 2017}}</ref>

=== 2018 ===
[[File:New joke textures compared to original textures.jpg|thumb|A comparison of some textures]]
{{see also|Texture Update}}

A version of Minecraft's textures was released for {{JE}}, available in versions [[Java Edition 1.12|1.12]].x and snapshots from [[Java Edition 17w43a|17w43a]] to [[Java Edition 18w11a|18w11a]]. It was announced that all editions of ''Minecraft'' would get the new version of textures.

The new textures are the original textures using 8-bit color, leading to a drastic reduction in detail.<ref>{{Mcnet|java-edition-textures-finally-perfected|Java Edition Textures Finally Perfected|April 1, 2018}}</ref> The [[splash text]] for this day also shows any of the following:

* Cleaner!
* Simplified!
* Perfected!amazing
* Art directed! (by robots)
* Machine learned textures!
* Not blurry!
* Not bubbly!
* Not cartoony!
* Photorealistic!
* Hand-painted!

The textures and the splashes were reverted on April 2, 2018 to the way they were before.<ref>{{tweet|dinner|980718994956210176|April fools! The new Minecraft textures have a few more colours than this ;) If you restart Minecraft: Java Edition then it should all go back to normal now!|April 2, 2018}}</ref> However, this update cannot be reactivated by setting the computer's date to April 1, 2018.

For April Fools 2022, [[Mojang Studios]] released a "One Block At A Time" snapshot ([[22w13oneBlockAtATime]]), which replaces the inventory with holding blocks, items or mobs function directly, hence the name "One Block at a Time".<ref>{{Mcnet|mojang-studios-release-new-astonishing-update|Mojang Studios release new astonishing update|April 1, 2022|Per Landin}}</ref>

==== Minecraft website ====
On the [https://minecraft.net ''minecraft.net''] website, two [[chicken]]s appear on the bottom left and bottom right of the page. Clicking on both of them causes them to breed and spawn numerous chickens, covering and spamming across the entire screen, sometimes crashing the user's browser.

This joke feature toggled on or off and after breeding and spawning chickens, the "''Close"'' button on the bottom can be hit to return to minecraft.net home page.

The Minecraft Launcher was set on fire spreading across the screen. On the left sidebar of the launcher, players could click at the [[water bucket]] and then click on the [[fire]] to extinguish them.

This joke feature can be toggled on or off, players can also mute the fire cracking and water bucket sounds.

Mojang Studios also published and released a joke snapshot - [[23w13a_or_b]], which was named ''"The Vote Update"'' a few hours later. The gameplay of this update revolves around a voting system, where the player chooses from many possible scenarios that change the state of the world.<ref>{{Mcnet|vote-update|Introducing: The Vote Update|April 1, 2023|Per Landin}}</ref>

=== 2024 ===
==== Minecraft website ====
The ''[https://minecraft.net minecraft.net]'' website was updated to feature several interactable [[poisonous potato]]es across the home page. When clicked, they deplete the [[health]] bar below the Minecraft logo, losing 1.5 - 2 hearts per click. When health bar gets fully depleted, the user is greeted with a [[Death messages|"You Died!" screen]] saying ''"You awoke the Toxifin"'', showing the score ''(consuming a potato gives you 1500 score'' '''[?]''' '')'' and a big "Respawn" button. Clicking the "Respawn" button takes the user back to minecraft.net and resets all the poisonous potatoes.

This joke feature can be toggled on or off by clicking ''"Turn off potatoes"'' on the top left corner.

==== Minecraft Launcher ====
The loading animation has been changed to a spinning poisonous potato with poison effect particles. Rarely{{Info needed}}, however, the loading screen can appear as a regular potato instead. Additionally, when clicking in the launcher, 1 to 10{{Info needed}} potatoes fly out from where the mouse is clicked and fading out.

The Play & Install buttons, the menu tab, and the headline's text had been changed from [[Noto Sans]] to [[Potatis]]. Additionally, all the E's, R's, and N's have been drawn backward. This may or may not{{Info needed}} be intentional, but there has been no confirmation and there may not be.

These joke features can be toggled on or off by toggling the ''"Enable April Fools 2024"'' checkbox in the launcher settings.

==== Poisonous Potato Update ====
{{main|Java Edition 24w14potato|Poisonous Potato Add-On}}
Unlike prior years, Mojang Studios released two separate April Fools releases on both {{JE}} and {{BE}}, under the name the "Poisonous Potato Update." On Java the snapshot [[24w14potato]] was released, adding potato-related blocks, food, tools, armor and weapons, as well as the [[Potato dimension]]. Players can teleport to the dimension by going into a [[potato portal]]. The dimension consists of floating islands made of potato blocks and has naturally spawning potato mobs, animals and villagers in potato villages. They also added potato themed structures. On Bedrock, the [[Poisonous Potato Add-On]], created and released by [[Jigarbov Productions]], was made available on the [[Marketplace]]. It adds new poisonous potato themed blocks, items and entities.<ref name="potato-update">{{Mcnet|poisonous-potato-update|Poisonous Potato Update|April 1, 2024}}</ref>

=== 2025 ===
[[File:Kilometers Prower.jpeg|thumb|A screenshot of the change]]
[[Gamemode One]] released a joke responding to a larger April Fools joke by [[SEGA]], announcing that [[Tails]] would be renamed to "Kilometres" in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (DLC)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] world, referencing the fact that "Miles" is both Tails' first name and a unit of distance measurement.<ref>{{Tweet|SEGA|1907123335013495267|Official Statement: Miles 'Tails' Prower}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|gmodeone|1907156431582699870|Wow, great decision, Mr. A Fools!<br><br>We checked in on Kilometers 'Tails' Prower, and they're excited for their new European Adventure 🧡<br><br>Minecraft blocks are measured in meters, so this has simplified a lot for us.}}</ref>

{{anchor|Mob Animator}}
==== Minecraft website ====
The home page for the [https://minecraft.net ''minecraft.net''] website was updated to include a '''Mob Animator''', with the [[splash text]] "How does it work? We don't know!". An option to spawn a [[mob]] was added and would summon a random mob, which was animated and could be dragged everywhere in the page.

The Mob Animator relies on a Microsoft [[w:A/B testing|A/B testing]] system that includes tracking, which means ad blockers, strict privacy protection mode in Firefox and rejecting cookies on Minecraft.net will cause it not to appear. There are also references to the rollout only being available to 66% users in the API responses, but this is not confirmed to be the case.

Combining a majority of mobs with the "animate mobs" tab by dragging the mobs and placing them in the empty slot would cause the second mob to disappear and the first mob to appear in the output slot, but with potion particles, which then shortly cause the affected mob to explode.
[[File:Minecraft.net 3D TNT aprilfools 2025.png|alt=Giant 3D TNT|thumb|The giant 3D TNT block]]
An option to spawn [[blocks]] was also included. Out of the Blocks, only TNT can be combined with TNT, which results in a giant 3D TNT block. This can be used to explode other UI elements on the website.

Moving TNT over anything except TNT causes the TNT to explode and both to vanish. Dirt and Stone both have a darker version, with the Dirt having a gradient with darker color at the top and lighter at the bottom, and the Stone looking almost entirely black. The splash text "Conveniently placed!" can be seen in the top left corner under the Mob Animator section in the sky.<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us</ref>

The arrow in the Mob Animator is grey by default, and it turns red when a mob combination is inputted. When certain combinations are inputted, the arrow will turn green, which signifies the combination will go through successfully. It is also possible to obtain larger versions of several different mobs by combining specific variants of those mobs (e.g. rotation direction, walking direction), though not all variants can be combined together successfully.

List of mobs that can be spawned in the Mob tab:
* {{EntityLink|Bee}}
* {{EntityLink|Chicken}} (3+ variants)
* {{EntityLink|Creeper}} (2+ variants)
* {{EntityLink|Pig}} (2+ variants)
* {{EntityLink|Slime}} (cannot be combined)
* {{EntityLink|Skeleton}} (4+ variants)
* {{EntityLink|Zombie}} (3+ variants)

List of blocks that can be spawned in the Blocks tab:
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}} (dark, light)
* {{BlockLink|Stone}} (dark, light)
* {{BlockLink|TNT}}

==== Minecraft Launcher ====
The Minecraft Launcher has been updated with a new "skill" system, akin to that of an RPG game, where any user interaction increases their Exp Point count. These "skills" can be toggled under the "Select Skill" menu and apply various modifiers to the launcher itself. The higher the level, the more skills the player unlocks.

The launcher is capped at level 30, after which the player is unable to gain any more experience points. It is possible to set it a higher level &ndash; up to level 9001, which in itself is a reference to [[w:It's_Over_9000!|"'''It's Over 9000!'''"]] &ndash; by editing the properties in the JSON file. Functionally this does not unlock anything else and anything over level 30 defaults to level "LAUNCHER HACKER", while any level over 9001 automatically rolls back to level 0.

The player can change these properties inside the '''launcher_prefs.json''' located within their [[.minecraft]] folder:<syntaxhighlight lang="typescript">
{
    "currentExperiencePointsPleaseDontHackThis": number, // (Current XP Count within Level, the amount required to level up scales per level)
    "currentLauncherLevelPleaseDontHackThis": number, // (Current Level)
    "enabledSkills": string[], // (Currently Applied "skills" to the launcher)
    "formatVersion": number,
    "version": number
}
</syntaxhighlight>These features can be toggled within the settings using the ''"Launcher Leveling System"'' toggle.

==== April Fools snapshot ====
{{main|Java Edition 25w14craftmine}}
Mojang Studios released the snapshot [[25w14craftmine]], also called the "Craftmine Update".
2025's April Fool's update, the Craftmine update, allows the player to use the new Mine Crafter to craft randomly generated levels, or "mines", to play through. The goal of each mine is to find the exit and craft the next mine. The mines appear to be generated similarly to the dimensions added in the 20w14∞ snapshot released in 2020.
