'''Vines''' are climbable non-solid vegetation blocks that grow on walls.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Vines can be destroyed with any item, but using [[shears]] is the only way to collect them. Shears enchanted with [[Efficiency]] are more efficient when used on vines; Efficiency II and above allows vines to be [[instant mining|instantly broken]].<ref>{{ytl|bhkx7mosH7g|t=444}}</ref> Using an axe on vines can also increase efficiency, but does not allow for collection, even with [[Silk Touch]]. If multiple vines exist within the same block space, breaking one of them breaks all of them instead of just the one targeted<ref>{{bug|MC-129114|||Invalid}}</ref> and results in only a single vine dropping<ref>{{bug|MC-123140||Vines lost when shearing many at once in a single block space|Unresolved}}</ref>. Shears used by a dispenser cannot break vines.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Vines|Axe|drop=0|shears=1|sword=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Vines (feature)}}
Vines are naturally generated in [[jungle]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s and [[lush caves]]. [[Jungle tree]]s of both sizes have vines on their trunks and canopy edges, and vines grow on the sides of jungle terrain. Vines are also naturally generated on [[oak]] trees in swamps and [[mangrove]] trees. {{IN|bedrock}}, vines can also generate on [[dying tree|dying]] oak, [[spruce]], jungle and [[dark oak]] trees.

Vines can generate growing on the stumps of oak and jungle [[fallen tree]]s.

Vines are found in [[jungle pyramid]]s and the allium room in [[woodland mansion]]s. They can also generate on the watchtower walls of [[pillager outpost]]s.

Vines can also be found in the {{cd|display_2}} structure in the [[trial chambers]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 3 vines for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
Vines generate on 2×2 jungle trees grown from [[sapling]]s, or mangrove trees grown from [[propagule]]s.

{{IN|bedrock}}, vines generate on [[dying tree]]s, which can sometimes be grown from saplings.

== Behavior ==
On each block tick, the vine block has a 25% chance to spread in a randomly selected direction. Their spreading can be toggled by the {{cd|doVinesSpread}} [[game rule]]{{only|java}}. Vines spread to adjacent blocks under certain conditions:

* Downward:
** If the block below is air, each side (north, south, east, and west) with vines has a 50% chance to spread downward.
** If the block below is a block, each side of that block with vines on the ticked block has a 50% chance of gaining vines.

* Upward: 
** If the block above is air and there are fewer than 4 other vine blocks in a 9×9×3 area surrounding the ticked vine block, each side (north, south, east, and west) with vines has a 50% chance to spread upward if that side is backed by a block that vines can be placed on.

* Horizontally: 
** If the current vine block isn't covering the target direction and there are fewer than 4 other vine blocks in a 9×9×3 area surrounding the ticked vine block, then:
*** If the block in the target direction is air, then it tries:

:::* If the vine block has vines to the left, and that side of the air block is backed by another air block, and the left side of the vine block is backed by something vines can be placed on, spread around the corner.
{{-}}

:::*If the air block in the target direction has something vines could be placed on above it, spread to the top side of the air block.
::*If the block in the target direction is opaque and fills its whole cube, spread to that side of the ticked vine block.

Vines will spread on every type of tree that they are placed on by the player.

Vines cannot be grown using [[bone meal]].

Vines do not need light when growing.

== Usage ==
Vines can be placed on the side of any block that fills its whole cube and blocks entity movement. They can also be placed on the bottom side of a block (although not the bottom side of another vine<ref>{{bug|MC-177513||Vines cannot be placed on the bottom of other vines|WAI}}</ref>). However, a vine block without vines on any of the horizontal sides disappears if it gets an update from a neighboring block. Vines attached to the bottom of [[stairs]] are completely deleted by any block update.<ref>{{bug|MC-128672||Vines placed on the bottom of stairs act anomalously|WAI}}</ref>

Several vines can be placed in the same block space, as long as they are facing different directions.

Vines can be climbed by standing next to them and holding the jump key. If there is a solid block behind the vines, the walk forward key can also be used.

Vines cancel a sprint if the player is sprinting, slowing the movement speed.

Vines absorb all fall damage, even without a solid surface nearby. {{control|Sneaking}} on vines causes the player to hang, even if the vines are not adjacent to any surface.

Blocks can replace vines if placed within the same block space. However, [[item frame]]s and [[painting]]s cannot.<ref>{{bug|MC-130017||Cannot replace replaceable blocks with paintings/item frames/glow item frames}}</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Placing vines into a [[composter]] has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== List of colors ==
The [[Block colors|coloration]] of vines is dependent on the [[biome]] they are in. A block always uses the color set to its location, regardless of how it was placed or of its source. In the inventory, vines have the color {{color|#48b518}}.

{{IN|BE}}, biome colors also appear on [[Map|maps]].<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|130658|Grass/foliage colors on maps still use the colors from Alpha v1.1.2_01 and earlier / do not change color with biomes|June 2, 2018}}</ref>

These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm. See [[biome colors]] for more information.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release|The used data values are as follows (tested in 1.7.6, any potential changes between Beta 1.8 Pre-release are not known):

{{dvt|spritetype=block|sprite=air|No attachments}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On south face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On west face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east, south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and east faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east, south and west faces|foot=1}}

The face of a vine is relative to its block space, and is the opposite of the face of the block it attaches to or the direction it itself faces (a south face vine is in the southernmost area of the block it exists in, but is attached to the north side of a block and itself faces north).}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w10a|Vine data values often result in incorrect orientations in many arrangements.<ref>{{bug|MC-50729|||Fixed}}</ref>

The data values appear to be as follows:

{{dvt|spritetype=block|sprite=air|No attachments - causes game crash}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On south face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On west face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On west and east faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east, south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east, south and west faces|foot=1}}}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w18a|Vine data values, according to {{cmd|setblock}}, appear to have reverted to their pre-14w10a states:
{{dvt|spritetype=block|sprite=vines|No attachments - appears on south face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On south face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On west face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east face}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On east, south and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north and east faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east and south faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east and west faces}}
{{dvt|sprite=vines|On north, east, south and west faces|foot=1}}

However, {{bug|MC-50729}} implies some mismatching still exists in some form, possibly with upward-attached vines, or possibly due to the grown vine blocks themselves using the wrong states instead of just models.{{info needed}}}}
