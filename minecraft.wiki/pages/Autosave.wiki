'''Autosaving''' is a feature where the game is periodically saved so the player doesn't lose their progress.

== Description ==
{{IN|JE}}, there is an autosave every 6,000 [[tick]]s (5 minutes), and every time the player opens the [[pause menu]] or a paused [[dialog]] screen. {{IN|BE}}, the game autosaves much more often{{Info needed|How does this exactly work?}}.

The autosave indicator can be toggled in the [[video settings]]. In ''Java Edition'', this is turned on by default and shows "Saving world" in the bottom right of the screen. In ''Bedrock Edition'', this is turned off by default and shows an animation of an arrow pointing into a [[chest]] in the top-right of the screen.
