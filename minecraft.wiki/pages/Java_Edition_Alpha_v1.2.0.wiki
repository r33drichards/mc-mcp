{{relevant guide|Java Edition guides/Halloween Update}}

'''Alpha v1.2.0''', also known as the '''[[Halloween Update]]''', is a major update to {{JE}}. It was released with [[Alpha server 0.2.2|server 0.2.2]] on October 30, 2010,<ref>[[wordofnotch:1441206676|The Halloween Update is out!]] – The Word of Notch, October 30, 2010</ref> at 20:53 UTC.<ref>[https://archive.org/download/MinecraftIRCLogs2010/%23minecraft.20101030.full.log #minecraft.20101030.full.log] – Minecraft IRC logs. "''[10/30/2010 4:53:43 PM] <Notch> I just uploaded the halloween update client''". [UTC&minus;4]</ref> It primarily added [[the Nether]] along with new Nether-exclusive mobs and blocks. It also added [[fishing]], a new terrain generator, and other changes and fixes.

Alpha v1.2.0 was re-uploaded immediately after release to prevent the game still saying "do not distribute" in the [[main menu]].<ref name="do-not-distribute">[https://archive.org/download/MinecraftIRCLogs2010/%23minecraft.20101030.full.log #minecraft.20101030.full.log] – Minecraft IRC logs. "''[10/30/2010 4:55:39 PM] <Notch> Awww, I forgot to fix the title screen''", "''[10/30/2010 4:55:43 PM] <Notch> it still says do not distribute''". [UTC–4]</ref>

This version is listed in the [[launcher]], but only [[Alpha v1.2.0_02]] is downloaded instead.<ref>{{bug|MCL-1421}}</ref>
