'''AI Goals'''
* Added the {{cd|"minecraft:behavior.use_kinetic_weapon"}} AI goal
** Description:
*** Allows a mob to make use of items with a {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} item component.
*** The mob will approach the target before using the weapon and charging with it.
*** If the target gets too close, the mob will retreat and reposition before charging again.
*** Once all {{cd|"max_duration"}} in the item's {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} component have elapsed, the mob goes on cooldown and retreats before approaching again.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|"approach_distance"}}: The distance to the target within which the mob begins using its kinetic weapon.
*** {{cd|"reposition_distance"}}: The distance the mob retreats to once the target is closer than the midpoint of the item's {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} component's minimum and maximum {{cd|"reach"}}.
*** {{cd|"reposition_speed_multiplier"}}: Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed while repositioning.
*** {{cd|"cooldown_distance"}}: The distance the mob retreats to after all of the item's {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} component's {{cd|"max_duration"}} values have elapsed.
*** {{cd|"cooldown_speed_multiplier"}}: Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed while on cooldown.
*** {{cd|"weapon_reach_multiplier"}}: Multiplier applied to the item's {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} component's {{cd|"reach"}}.
*** {{cd|"weapon_min_speed_multiplier"}}: Multiplier applied to each {{cd|"min_speed"}} and {{cd|"min_relative_speed"}} condition in the item's {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} component.
*** {{cd|"min_path_time"}}: Minimum base time, in seconds, before recalculating a new attack path to the target (before increases are applied).
*** {{cd|"max_path_time"}}: Maximum base time, in seconds, before recalculating a new attack path to the target (before increases are applied).
*** {{cd|"path_fail_time_increase"}}: Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the mob cannot move along the current path.
*** {{cd|"inner_boundary_time_increase"}}: Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the target is beyond {{cd|"path_inner_boundary"}}.
*** {{cd|"outer_boundary_time_increase"}}: Time, in seconds, added to the attack path recalculation interval when the target is beyond {{cd|"path_outer_boundary"}}.
*** {{cd|"path_inner_boundary"}}: Distance at which to increase attack path recalculation by {{cd|"inner_boundary_time_increase"}}.
*** {{cd|"path_outer_boundary"}}: Distance at which to increase attack path recalculation by {{cd|"outer_boundary_time_increase"}}.
*** {{cd|"speed_multiplier"}}: Multiplier applied to the mob's movement speed when moving toward its target.
*** {{cd|"require_complete_path"}}: Specifies whether a full navigation path from the mob to the target is required.
*** {{cd|"track_target"}}: Allows the mob to track its target even if it lacks a hard-coded sensing component.
*** {{cd|"cooldown_time"}}: Cooldown time, in seconds, between consecutive attacks.
*** {{cd|"melee_fov"}}: Field of view, in degrees, used by the hard-coded sensing component to detect a valid attack target.
*** {{cd|"x_max_rotation"}}: Maximum rotation, in degrees, on the X-axis while the mob is trying to look at its target.
*** {{cd|"y_max_head_rotation"}}: Maximum rotation, in degrees, on the Y-axis while the mob is trying to look at its target.
*** {{cd|"random_stop_interval"}}: Defines a 1-in-N chance for the mob to stop its current attack, where N equals {{cd|"random_stop_interval"}}.
*** {{cd|"attack_once"}}: Allows the mob to perform this melee attack behavior only once during its lifetime.
** Requirements:
*** The mob must have an item with the {{cd|"minecraft:kinetic_weapon"}} item component
*** Must otherwise fulfill the same conditions as other melee attack goals.
*** {{cd|"minecraft:behavior.melee_box_attack"}}, {{cd|"minecraft:behavior.delayed_attack"}}, {{cd|"minecraft:behavior.melee_attack"}} and {{cd|"minecraft:behavior.stomp_attack"}} now correctly apply their {{cd|"path_inner_boundary"}} field.

'''API'''
* Added new module {{cd|@minecraft/server-graphics}} to change graphics and rendering settings.
* The {{cmd|/clone}} command now fires {{cd|onBreak}} beta API event for custom blocks overridden at source destination.

'''[[Biome]]s'''
* The client side Molang queries {{cd|query.entity_biome_has_all_tags}}, {{cd|query.entity_biome_has_any_tags}}, and {{cd|query.entity_biome_has_any_identifier}} no longer need the Upcoming Creator Features toggle to be used.

'''Block Components'''
* The option {{cd|"alpha_masked_tint"}} in {{cd|"minecraft:material_instances"}} now requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle again.
* Modified {{cd|"minecraft:material_instances"}} block component.
* Field emissive renamed to shaded to better describe what the field does.
* Default value of shaded now true, when false the material ignores face_dimming and ambient occlusion.
* Released field {{cd|"shaded"}}, formerly called {{cd|"emissive"}} from experimental.

'''Entity Components'''
* Added new field, {{cd|"protection_slot"}}, to {{cd|minecraft:burns_in_daylight}}, which allows specifying an equipment slot that should provide protection from burning in daylight.
** Valid values are {{cd|"slot.weapon.offhand"}}, {{cd|"slot.armor.head"}}, {{cd|"slot.armor.chest"}}, {{cd|"slot.armor.legs"}}, {{cd|"slot.armor.feet"}}, and {{cd|"slot.armor.body"}}.
** Leaving this field unspecified will default to having the head armor slot provide protection from burning in daylight.
* In the {{cd|"minecraft:ageable"}} and {{cd|"minecraft:breedable"}} components, the {{cd|"transform_to_item"}} field has been renamed to {{cd|"result_item"}}.
** This field is now defined for each item entry in each component's {{cd|"items"}} list, enabling item-specific transformations on use.
* Added {{cd|"result_item"}} field to the items in the {{cd|"minecraft:healable"}} and {{cd|"minecraft:tameable"}} components.
** This field is defined for each item entry in the {{cd|"items"}} list.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", "Upcoming Creator Features" [[experimental]] toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[Block]]s'''
* Added component {{cd|minecraft:connection_rule}} behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle, which allows custom blocks to define whether other blocks with connection behavior - such as [[fence]]s, [[wall]]s, [[bars]], and [[glass pane]]s - can try to create a connection.
* Added [[Block tag (Bedrock Edition)|VanillaBlockTag]] {{cd|minecraft:has_fence_connections}} that can be used to identify a custom block as a block that creates connections like a fence; this tag is required to create connections between custom and Vanilla fences.
** The component and tag can be used along with the {{cd|minecraft:connection}} block trait to make a custom fence that creates connections like a Vanilla fence.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''API Infra'''
* Modernized AvailableCommandsPacket serialization. Added these constraints:
** Chained Subcommand Data / Name max size set to 512 characters.
** Commands / Name max size set to 512 characters.
** Commands / Description max size set to 1000 characters.
** Commands / Chained Subcommand Indexes max size set to 250 elements.
** Commands / Overloads max size set to 250 elements.
** Constraints / Constraint Indices max size set to 250 elements.
