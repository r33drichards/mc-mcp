'''Riptide''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[trident]]s that causes the trident to launch the user when used in water or rain, replacing the trident's ability to be thrown as a projectile.

== Obtaining ==
Riptide can be obtained from [[enchanting tables]], drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]],{{only|bedrock}} books obtained by [[fishing]], [[monster room]] chests, vaults, librarian [[villager]]s, and non-village [[structure]] loot.

== Usage ==
[[File:RiptideExample.gif|thumb|[[Sunny]] using a Riptide trident in the rain.]]
Tridents enchanted with Riptide can be thrown only when a [[player]] stands in water or when exposed to [[rain]]. In those situations, a thrown trident launches the player with it. Players can reach greater heights by throwing a Riptide trident straight upward, and travel further distances by throwing it from a higher altitude, or by [[sprinting]] or [[sprint-swimming]] while in motion. If a Riptide-enchanted trident is held in both the main hand and the off-hand, the player's velocity is not doubled and only the trident in the main is used (see [[dual wield]]), although the animation for both tridents is displayed on the [[Heads-up display|HUD]].

The formula for the number of blocks the trident throws the user is (6 × level) + 3 when in rain or standing in water, and (4 × level) + 3 while underwater.

Riptide cannot be used in biomes (or altitudes) where it doesn't rain, even if the current weather in these locations is snow or overcast.

If the player collides with a mob or another player, the trident deals throwing damage, including critical damage if the player is falling, and the player's movement is abruptly stopped. Throwing a Riptide trident consumes 1 durability.{{only|java|short=1}} In this situation, a Riptide trident can bypass the defense of a shield. Colliding with a mob to deal damage consumes 1 durability regardless of version, which means a collision {{in|JE}} damages the trident twice. If the Riptide trident is in the off-hand, damage is dealt with the item in the main hand, if any.

If an item is being held in the off-hand during movement, on the HUD, the held item appears at the top-left, with the top of the item texture facing the direction the player is (unless that item is another [[trident]], in which case the same animation as the Riptide trident is played, regardless of if the trident in the off-hand is enchanted with Riptide or not). The same is true if the trident is in the off-hand and the held item in the main hand, if any. The trident, the item in the main/off-hand (if any), and other items can be swapped, rearranged, or thrown out to create different animation combinations.

=== Elytra ===
A Riptide trident can be used to propel a player with a pair of [[elytra]], in rainy weather or in a body of water. This allows the player to reach speeds as high as 125 blocks per second,<ref>{{bug|MC-147173||Using riptide tridents while elytra flying can boost the player to excessive speeds}}</ref> much faster than the 33.5 blocks-per-second speed achieved using [[firework rocket]]s.

== Incompatibilities ==
Since a Riptide trident never leaves the player's hand when used, [[Loyalty]] cannot be used, and because of that, the two enchantments can't be combined. [[Channeling]] is also mutually exclusive with Riptide, both because the trident never really lands anywhere, and because it would strike lightning at the player's own position.

If combined using commands, Riptide takes priority over Loyalty and Channeling.
