'''Silverfish''' are small [[hostile]] [[arthropod]]s found [[Infested Block|infesting stone and deepslate blocks]] in [[mountain]] caves and certain [[structure]]s, such as [[stronghold]]s, or spawned using [[potions of Infestation]]. They attack by biting, and attacking one can cause nearby silverfish to break out of their blocks to attack the aggressor.

== Spawning ==
Silverfish spawn from broken [[infested block]]s, which generate in [[stronghold]]s, underground in [[mountains]] and [[windswept hills]] [[biome]]s, in [[igloo]] basements, and in [[woodland mansion]] false portal rooms. Silverfish do not appear if the block is broken with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment.<ref>{{bug|MC-48184|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Monster spawners ===
Silverfish [[monster spawner]]s naturally generate in [[end portal]] rooms in [[stronghold]]s. Silverfish can spawn from spawners at [[light level]] 11 or lower. {{IN|java}}, they can also spawn on stone types they can enter (stone, cobblestone, stone bricks, etc.) at any light level, and cannot spawn within a 5 block distance of any player{{verify}}.

=== Trial spawners ===
Each [[trial chamber]]s structure has a 25% chance to select silverfish as the "small melee" mob for its [[trial spawner]]s.

During [[ominous trial]]s, each [[ominous trial spawner]] has a {{frac|1|7}} chance to be able to dispense [[lingering potion]]s of Infestation, which spawns silverfish when an affected entity takes damage. Any type of trial spawner can dispense Infested potions, regardless of the mob type it spawns.

=== Infested ===
Silverfish have a 10% chance to spawn in groups of 1-2 when an entity with the [[Infested]] effect takes damage.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Silverfish have no drops other than {{xp|5}} [[experience]] points when killed by a player or [[tamed wolf]].

== Behavior ==
[[File:Silverfish infest anim.gif|alt=|thumb|right|A silverfish being freed from an infested block, which calls for help from other silverfish; causing them to emerge from more infested blocks.]]
Silverfish attack [[player]]s, and [[snow golem]]s, and they call other silverfish in the area upon being hit. Silverfish pathfind toward the player and can see the player through walls. 

When they suffer [[Poison]] damage or damage inflicted by the player and survive, they cause other silverfish within a 21×11×21 area to break out of their infested blocks. The player can prevent other silverfish from appearing by killing them in one hit.<ref>{{bug|MC-2432|||WAI}}</ref> If the game rule {{cd|doTileDrops}} is set to {{cd|false}}, the infested blocks are broken, but no silverfish spawn from them. 

Silverfish, being [[arthropod]]s, take extra damage from the [[Bane of Arthropods]] enchantment, and receive [[Slowness]] IV upon being hit.

When idle, silverfish enter a nearby [[deepslate]], [[stone]], [[cobblestone]], [[stone bricks]], [[mossy stone bricks]], [[cracked stone bricks]], or [[chiseled stone bricks]] block, transforming it into the respective [[infested block]] if the [[game rule]] {{cd|mobGriefing}} is set to {{cd|true}}, as per default. They cannot infest [[mossy cobblestone]],<ref>{{bug|MC-167357}}</ref> despite being capable of infesting both mossy blocks and cobblestone, and they also cannot infest [[slab]] and [[stairs]] of these blocks.<ref>{{bug|MC-167372}}</ref> They are also unable to infest [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]] or [[smooth stone]].<ref>{{bug|MC-189974}}</ref>

Silverfish are immune to the [[infested]] status effect.
