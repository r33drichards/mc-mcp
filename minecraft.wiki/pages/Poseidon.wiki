'''Poseidon''' is the god of the seas and the main villain of Season 2 of the [[Minecraft Mini-Series]].

== Appearance ==
Poseidon is similar to Zeus, but has light blue skin, bright light blue hair and beard, and black eyebrows, a white colored robe with a gold or yellow belt, a yellow sash, what appear to be some kind of gold bracelets and shoulder pads, golden, open-toed sandals, and seemingly no pants. He holds a trident.

== Biography ==
The series doesn't really reveal Poseidon's origins or how he got the [[Command Block (Mini-Series)|command block]] statue and trident. At some point in his life, Poseidon had a son from a Greek woman. He then met [[CommuniKate]] and [[Zed]] and agreed to fund their show, gave them a [[command block]] and made arrangements in advance for the show's second season to take place in the [[Greek Isles]]. In the show's second season, all of the contestants and hosts are teleported to the Greek Isles and meet Poseidon. But Poseidon betrays the former hosts, takes over the show (he needed it as a cover so that Zeus wouldn't find out about Poseidon's insidious plan) and forces them, along with [[Durango]] and [[Quinn]], to bring him five enchanted eyes of Ender in exchange for their friends' lives. When the eyes were brought to him, Poseidon showed a portal to the Overworld and revealed his plan, sending the rest of the heroes to be eaten by the [[Kraken]]. The heroes escape and try to stop Poseidon. The god calls upon [[Phoenix]] to defeat the heroes, but the heroes defeat him too, and then Poseidon triggers the self-destruction of the command block statue, and during this he fights his son [[Theseus]] on the fish. The statue explodes, and after that, [[Zeus]] flies in, stops his brother and takes all the eyes for himself.

== Personality ==
{{Expand section}}
Poseidon is shown as an evil, cunning, manipulative character who is eager to conquer and rule the world.

== Relationships ==
=== Zeus ===
Despite the fact that Zeus and Poseidon are brothers, they have a rather bad relationship, since Zeus, knowing that his brother could be dangerous, hid the enchanted eyes of Ender from him, and therefore Poseidon holds a grudge against him.
=== Theseus ===
Theseus and Poseidon had a good family relationship, even though Poseidon turned out to be a villain, Theseus did not want to fight him.
=== CommuniKate ===
They used to have a commercial relationship, but after the god betrayed Kate for personal gain and cover, Kate hated him and after working for him, tried to stop him.
