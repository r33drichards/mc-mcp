== Additions ==
'''[[Settings#Accessibility|Accessibility]]'''
* Added a setting to show gameplay [[subtitles]], which does not function properly yet.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-232701||Subtitles are not toggable}} 
* '''Known issue''': This feature is not working as expected and we aim to have it fixed in an upcoming preview release.</ref>
