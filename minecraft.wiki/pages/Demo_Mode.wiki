The '''Demo Mode''' is a [[w:Game demo|demo]] of ''[[Minecraft]]'' for users who have not purchased the game yet and would like to try it out first without purchasing it.

The demo version of {{JE}} can be played free of charge by logging into the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' with a Microsoft account that hasn't purchased the game yet. This version consists of a single [[World seed|seed]] that can be played for up to 5 in-game days (1 hour and 40 minutes total). It is designed to replace the functionality of the outdated [[PC Gamer Demo]].

A dedicated webpage is also available on [https://www.minecraft.net/free-trial minecraft.net].

== Functionality ==
The demo mode can be played by all players regardless of whether they have yet purchased the game. Demo Mode functionally serves to allow the [[player]]s to try out the game before deciding to buy ''Minecraft''. It allows players to play on a single world for a 100-minute (5 [[Daylight cycle|in-game days]]) period before the map is locked and required to be reset.

Custom skins can be applied {{in|bedrock}}, and it is possible to install [[resource pack]]s and [[mod]]s on the ''Java Edition'' demo.

While demo mode does not expire, it comes with certain restrictions as its sole purpose is to allow new players to try out ''Minecraft''.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
The following restrictions apply when playing the game in demo mode:
* The demo map is preset and always generates with the same seed: <code>-343522682</code>, corresponding to the text seed <code>North Carolina</code>.
** This means that the player '''[[World Spawn|spawn]]''', '''seed''', and '''[[generated structures]]''' are always the same.
* The game is locked to Survival mode and [[commands]] are disabled by default.
** Commands can be enabled and other game modes can be made accessible by using Open to LAN.
* Multiplayer servers are inaccessible, although [[LAN]] multiplayer is allowed, with the limitation that only 1 demo account is allowed on a server (this is because the default ''Minecraft'' name ('Player') cannot be changed).
* The game time is limited to five in-game days (1 hour and 40 minutes real-time or 100 minutes total). After the time runs out, players can still navigate through the world, but their interactions with it are limited. Resetting the demo world also resets the demo timer.
** Changing the in-game time forcibly with commands or external programs such as an NBT editor can reset the timer.
** It is possible to gain (almost) unlimited time in the demo by changing the in-game time to extreme negative values (past the minimum 64-bit integer limit, which is -9,223,372,036,854,655,508). However, the number causes several problems such as hostile mobs behaving passively to players.
*** The player can still attack/kill mobs and take damage. Their hunger, saturation, health, and drowning bars work as normal, but they cannot eat anything.
*** Breaking any block leads to the block being instantly restored, and placing any block leads to the block being deleted.
*** The player can still remove [[boat]]s, but they cannot place them.
*** The player can still pick up dropped items.
* "Demo" is displayed in the version notation on the [[title screen]].

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
On December 20, 2018, a trial version of ''Minecraft'' for Android titled '''''Minecraft Trial''''' was released. However, restrictions from ''Bedrock Edition'', along with some new ones still apply; for example, some blocks and items are removed, including barriers and command blocks (all types). There are also trial versions for {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}} and the {{w|PlayStation 4}}.
* [https://xbox.com/games/store/-/9NBLGGH2JHXJ Microsoft Store (Windows)]
* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecrafttrialpe Google Play (Android)]
* [https://playstation.com/games/minecraft PlayStation Store (PlayStation 4)]
It has the following restrictions:
* The time limit is 90 minutes in real time.
* The player cannot play [[multiplayer]], including LAN multiplayer. On the PlayStation 4 and 5, split-screen multiplayer is possible.
* The player cannot change [[Resource pack|Global Resources]] and [[Add-ons]], but can import custom [[skin]]s.
* The player is restricted to [[Survival mode]].
* The player is restricted from changing '''[[Commands|Cheats]]''' and '''World Options''' parts off.
* The player is restricted from changing '''Trust Player Permissions'''.
* The player is restricted from turning on '''Experiments'''.
* The player is restricted from accessing storage.
* The player cannot change the world seed.
* The player is restricted to Infinite world type.
** There have been 5 demo seeds, which are <code>818010429</code>, <code>29300</code>, <code>1395001428</code>, <code>1537846859</code> and <code>1193926712</code> in 1.20.

== Legacy Console Edition ==
Demo mode is supported on all [[Legacy Console Edition]] platforms, except for [[Wii U Edition|Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch Edition|Nintendo Switch]]. However, due to the removal of the ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'' and ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' from digital storefronts after their replacement with ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', as well as the shutdown of the [[Xbox 360 Edition|Xbox 360]] store in July 2024, the only demo that can still be downloaded and played in the current day is the ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]''. (And technically Xbox One Edition with a few workarounds)

On PlayStation 3, players who have purchased the full version of the game digitally can also access demo mode by [https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/accountinfo/systemactivation.html deactivating] their console. The game will remain in demo mode until the console is re-activated.

The following restrictions apply in demo mode:
* The only playable world is the [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial|tutorial world]]. Selecting the "Play Game" button in the main menu will immediately start the tutorial world.
* Players cannot save their progress; after exiting the world, all progress that has been made will be permanently lost.
* Online multiplayer is not available. Only local [[Splitscreen/Legacy Console Edition|splitscreen]] multiplayer is supported.
* [[Mini games]] are not available. Selecting the "Mini Games" button in the main menu will cause the game to instruct the player to purchase the full game.
* Players cannot change their [[skin]] from the default.
* Players cannot change the [[Texture pack (downloadable content)|texture pack]] from the default.
* [[Achievement/Legacy Console and New Nintendo 3DS editions|Achievements or trophies]] cannot be earned.
* Players cannot enable [[host privileges]] in the tutorial world. As a result, the game mode is locked to [[Survival]], and the [[difficulty]] is locked to Easy.
** The only options that can be toggled on or off in the tutorial world are: Fire Spreads, TNT Explodes, Mob Loot, Tile Drops and Natural Regeneration.
* The game has a time limit.{{more information needed|What is the exact duration of the time limit?}} After time runs out, players will be given the option to either purchase the game and continue their progress, or exit the game and lose their progress.

== Trivia ==
* It is possible to play in-game modes other than [[Survival]] in the demo mode by opening up the world to LAN with cheats enabled and executing {{command|gamemode}} command. This does not remove the time limit, or the demo message.{{only|java}}
* {{IN|Java}}, deleting the files "<code>level.dat</code>" and "<code>level.dat_old</code>" causes the timer to reset. Additionally, a new bonus chest spawns on the original spawn point.
* Servers can be started with the <code>--demo</code> flag (this is technically what the launcher does). Everyone who joins the server sees the demo message.
* If one tries to play a demo version before 1.3 from the launcher using a non-premium account, they can play the full version. This is because 1.3 is the version that added the demo mode to ''[[Minecraft]]'', so earlier versions do not have the code necessary to recognize that they are in the demo.
* Typing in "<code>North Carolina</code>" in the seed screen of the full version gives the same world seed as the ''Java Edition'' demo version.
* If the ''Minecraft'' shortcut and directory is moved to another hard drive, etc., it remains in the demo version, and the previous worlds do not appear.
* If a world is downloaded, it can be played by putting the world folder in "<code>saves</code>" and renaming it to "<samp>Demo_World</samp>". If there is already "<samp>Demo_World</samp>", it must be first renamed or deleted. There is a chance that the demo timer has decreased or expired. This is due to the timer being used by the world's creator while building the world. Deleting "<code>level.dat</code>" and "<code>level.dat_old</code>" in such situations does not reset the timer.
