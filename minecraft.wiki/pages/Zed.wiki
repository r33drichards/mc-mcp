'''Zed''' is a [[zombie]] character appearing in [[Minecraft Mini-Series|''Minecraft Mini-Series'']], serving as a sidekick and co-host to [[CommuniKate]].

== Appearance ==
Zed is a zombie, appearing bald with black eyes and olive green skin. Instead of the traditional cyan shirt, he wears a black T-shirt with red cuffs and a print of flames. However, his shoes and pants are the same as a typical zombie. Under most circumstances, he can also be seen wearing an umbrella hat, allowing him to survive during the day.

== Personality ==
Serving as something of a comic relief, Zed is portrayed as near mute, the closest thing to typical dialogue being existing zombie sounds from the game. As a result, Zed has little agency during season 1, mostly going along with whatever CommuniKate says or working to keep her hostages contained. 

However, when [[Poseidon]] takes over the show, a different side of Zed is shown. While CommuniKate has to learn to value teamwork and take the crisis seriously, Zed is near immediately cooperative with the heroes, and seems to respect them more than he let on. During the second season, he often serves as muscle.

== Biography ==
Before the series began, he met [[CommuniKate]] and became her friend. Later in the series, he founded and helped with the show with her. However, at the beginning of the second season, [[Poseidon]] betrayed Zed and CommuniKate, and took their show, and forced the former hosts along with [[Durango]] and [[Quinn]] to bring him the enchanted eyes of Ender. After [[Zeus]]' victory over Poseidon and the help of all the heroes, Zeus does not know what happened to Zed and Kate.

== Trivia ==

* Zed's name could be read as simply being the letter Z, which is often pronounced singularly as zed.
** A similar situation occurred with [https://powerrangers.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Zedd Lord Zedd], the main antagonist of the ''{{Wikipedia|Power Rangers}}'' franchise.
**Zed is sometimes used to refer to zombies in general, such as in the ''[[Wikipedia:Killing Floor (video game)|Killing Floor]]'' franchise.
