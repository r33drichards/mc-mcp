'''Sunflower plains''' are flat grasslands [[biome]]s that generate with [[sunflowers]]. They are the only places where sunflowers naturally generate.

==Description==
The mostly flat sunflower plains feature large numbers of [[sunflower]]s across their landscape, and are the only places where sunflowers generate. Other flowers such as [[azure bluet]], [[oxeye daisy]] and [[cornflower]], and both [[Short Grass|short grass]] and [[Tall Grass|tall grass]], also grow among the sunflowers. [[Oak trees]] are found in modest numbers and sparsely, fancy oak trees (5% of oaks within the biome) often come with bee nest. [[Bush|Bushes]] do not naturally grow in sunflower plains, unlike in [[plains]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, villages and outposts still generate here, but {{in|java}}, they do not.<ref>{{bug|MC-238557|||WAI}}</ref>

Sunflower plains generate in place of a [[Flower Forest|flower forest]] biome in high [[weirdness]] values, and thus are commonly separated from them by [[River|rivers]]. Biomes that often border sunflower plains include regular plains and [[cherry grove]]s.
