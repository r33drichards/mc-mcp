'''1.9.3-pre2''' is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.9.3]], released on April 27, 2016,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430045309/http://www.mojang.com/2016/04/minecraft-193-pre-release-2|title=Minecraft 1.9.3 Pre-Release 2|website=Mojang.com|date=April 27, 2016|author=[[Searge]]}}</ref> which adds {{cmd|stopsound}}, tests server blocking, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|stopsound}}'''
* Permits the player to choose which specific sounds should be stopped from playing.
** Syntax: <code>/stopsound <nowiki><player></nowiki> [source] [sound]</code>.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''Networking'''
* In this version, the game checks https://sessionserver.mojang.com/blockedservers<ref>[{{reddit|4hh3ns/mojangs_server_blacklist_what_it_is_and_why_its_a}} "Very recently (past ~3 days or so), it was discovered that Minecraft 1.9.3 pre-2 had code that included a server blacklist, effectively preventing vanilla (or possibly all?) Minecraft clients from connecting to specific servers."] – /u/ceruleanRevue, May 2, 2016</ref> when connecting to a multiplayer server, and if the server is on the blocked server list, it reports to the user that the server is unavailable.
** This behavior was removed in [[1.9.3-pre3]].
