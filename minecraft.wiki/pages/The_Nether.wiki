[[File:Vibrant Visuals Nether.png|thumb|The Nether with [[Vibrant Visuals]].]]
The '''Nether''' is a dangerous, volcanic [[dimension]] containing [[fire]], [[lava]], fungal vegetation, many [[hostile mobs]], and exclusive [[structure]]s and [[biome]]s.

== Accessing ==
{{Main|Nether portal}}
[[File:Full and Budget Nether Portal.png|thumb|right|"Economy" portal without corners (left), and a full portal (right)]]

To access the Nether, the [[player]] must construct a [[nether portal]] in the [[Overworld]] (portals created in [[the End]] do not activate). To create the portal, the player must first build a rectangular [[obsidian]] frame, ranging in size from a minimum of 4 blocks × 5 blocks to a maximum of 23 blocks × 23 blocks. Once the frame is completed, it can then be activated by placing [[fire]] within the frame, using [[flint and steel]], [[fire charge]], [[dispenser]]s, or any material that is capable of igniting fire. 

The portal allows most [[entities]] (with the exception of the [[wither]] and the [[ender dragon]]) to be transported to a corresponding portal in the Nether. In [[Survival]], the player must stand in a nether portal for 4 seconds to enter the Nether. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. The portal plays a sound effect while the player is inside it. If there is no corresponding portal, a new 4×5 portal is created. The portal can be destroyed by breaking the obsidian frame, by a nearby explosion, or by placing [[water]] in the Overworld or [[lava]] into it with a [[bucket]] or [[dispenser]]. Any of the [[block]]s in the corners can be destroyed without destroying the portal.

The Nether could generate in the former [[Old]]{{only|bedrock}} world type, (with the same 256×256 borders as the Overworld) though nether portals could not be created without using commands. Nether portals created in the Nether could spawn the player outside of the world barrier.

If [[cheats]] are enabled, players can also teleport to the Nether without using a nether portal: the syntax is {{cmd|execute in the_nether}} {{in|java}}, and {{cmd|execute in nether}} {{in|bedrock}}.

== Traits ==
[[Bedrock]] forms a rough 5 layer ceiling on top of the nether (starting at [[altitude|y-level]] 123 and ending at y-level 127) restricting the player from leaving the Nether. Just like in the [[Overworld]], the player is protected from falling off the world by 5 bottom layers of bedrock (starting at y level 4 and ending at y-level 0) in a rough pattern. This makes the Nether 128 blocks high unlike the Overworld's 384. As with the vast Overworld and [[End]] dimensions of the ''Java'' and ''Bedrock'' Editions, the Nether is equally horizontally vast to the [[world border]]. 

{{IN|Java}}, build limit in the Nether is 256 blocks: if the player manages to get on top of the bedrock roof, they can build additional 128 blocks upward on it. {{IN|bedrock}}, the build limit in the Nether is 128 blocks, despite it being 256 in the End, and 320 in the Overworld.

The Nether has no [[daylight cycle]] and no [[weather]]. Natural sources of [[light]] include [[fire]], [[lava]], [[Nether portal|portal]]s, [[shroomlight]]s and [[glowstone]]. Even with a light level of 0, the Nether has a dim ambient light (roughly equivalent to light level 8 in the Overworld). Light otherwise functions exactly the same as it does in the Overworld and the End.

The majority of "flora" in the Nether is fungus-based as opposed to plants. The Nether "grass" consists of specialized Nether mycelium (known as "[[nylium]]"). The Nether features its own unique [[fungi]] (including Nether wart), as well as equivalent [[huge fungi]] that serve as [[tree]]s. The stems of the huge fungi function as [[log]]s. Also present are a number of native vines and roots.

Most creatures found in the Nether are hostile and potentially dangerous.

Locations in the Nether correlate to Overworld [[coordinates]], but horizontal Overworld distances are scaled down by a ratio of 8:1 for travel in the Nether. Therefore, traveling one block in the Nether means traveling eight blocks in the Overworld. For example, in a perfect scenario, a player who enters a portal in the Overworld at X=0, Z=0 and travels in the Nether to X=1000, Z=1000 returns to the Overworld at X=8000, Z=8000. This makes portals a useful tool for traveling long distances in the Overworld. This does not allow one to pass the Overworld World border.

{{Calculator|netherCoords}}

Most items and blocks in the Nether function the same as they do in the Overworld, with a few notable exceptions: 

*[[Bed]]s cannot be used as a spawn point; they instead [[explode]] and cause fires when a player attempts to sleep in one. It has an explosion power of 5. The explosion is larger than that of [[TNT]], which has an explosion power of 4.
** Villagers, if brought into the Nether, can still use beds safely during night time in the Overworld.
*The player may use a powered [[respawn anchor]] to respawn in the Nether, but when it runs out of charges, the player once again respawns in the Overworld.
*There is no way to place liquid [[water]] in the Nether without the use of [[commands]], except inside a [[cauldron]]. These can be used to put out a player on fire.
**Using [[water bucket]]s produces steam particles and a hissing sound, leaving the player with an empty [[bucket]].
**[[Ice]] that is melted or smashed in the Nether does not produce water.
**A [[wet sponge]] instantly becomes a regular [[sponge]] when placed.
**If placed using cheats or when placed inside a cauldron, water takes on a reddish-brown color.{{only|bedrock}}
*Lava flows twice as far (eight blocks) and three times as fast in the Nether compared to Overworld, with the same flowing distance and half the flowing speed of water in the Overworld.
*[[Grass block]]s and [[leaves]] take on a dead-looking brownish color because the Nether is [[Biome#Dry/warm biomes|dry and hot]].
*[[Map]]s generate a brown-gray static pattern. The player's direction indicator spins randomly; its location is still relative to the player's location in the Nether, except in the [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]], where it is always in the center of the map. Usable significantly for lava ocean travel via a [[strider]]. Putting the map in the off-hand minimizes the map to help see one's strider footing.
*[[Clock]]s spin wildly, making it impossible to tell the time while in the Nether. [[Compass]]es also spin wildly unless connected to a [[lodestone]], which they then point toward.
*[[Eye of Ender|Eyes of ender]] cannot be thrown, since no [[stronghold]]s generate in the Nether.
*[[Snow golem]]s rapidly take fire damage and die, due to the Nether being dry and hot. However, they can survive if they have the {{EffectLink|Fire Resistance}} status effect.
*[[Pointed Dripstone|Stalactites]] produce lava particles instead of water particles, and do not convert [[mud]] above them into [[clay]].<ref>{{bug|MC-264720||Mud does not convert to clay in Nether with dripstone|WAI}}</ref>
*[[Creaking heart]]s do not spawn [[creaking]]s when placed between two [[pale oak log]]s.
*[[Eyeblossom]]s do not change between open and closed states depending on the time of day.

== Environment ==
The Nether features unique cave-like terrain with no sky. Lava and fire are common hazards everywhere in the Nether. Areas distant from the player are shrouded in [[Fog#Nether fog|fog]] of red or blue, depending on the biome. The shape of the terrain in the Nether is independent of the biome distribution; instead, the biomes alter the surface material and add terrain features to the netherrack terrain. 

=== Biomes===
{{Main|Biome#The Nether}}
The Nether is divided into several biomes just like the Overworld, each featuring unique terrain, mobs, structures, ambience, etc. There are currently five [[biome]]s in the Nether:

{| class="wikitable collapsible" data-description="Nether biomes"
! width="15%" |Biome name
!Description
!Screenshot
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Nether wastes]]'''
|{{anchor|Nether|The Nether|Hell|Nether wastes}}
The Nether wastes is the most common biome in the Nether. The terrain mainly consists of [[netherrack]], with [[glowstone]] clusters growing and lava leaking from the ceiling and [[gravel]] and [[soul sand]] lining its shores. Most of the Nether’s mobs can spawn here, including [[ghast]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[strider]]s, [[piglin]]s, and the occasional [[enderman]].
|[[File:Nether.png|thumb|Nether wastes]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Soul sand valley]]'''
|{{anchor|Soul sand valley}}
The soul sand valley mainly consists of [[soul sand]], basalt and [[soul soil]]. Notable features of the biome are exposed [[nether fossil]]s in various shapes and sizes, large amounts of [[lava]], blue fog, large spires made of [[basalt]], [[soul fire]], and the occasional [[nether fortress]] or [[bastion remnant]]. [[Ghast]]s and [[skeleton]]s are common in this biome while [[Enderman|endermen]] are rare. [[Strider|Striders]] can spawn here as well. This is the only place to find [[dried ghast]]s naturally.
|[[File:Soul Sand Valley.png|thumb|Soul sand valley]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Crimson forest]]'''
|{{anchor|Crimson forest}}
The crimson forest consists of many [[Huge crimson fungus|huge crimson fungi]], which act as the "trees" of this biome. The huge fungi often generate with [[Weeping Vines|weeping vines]] hanging from them, and [[Shroomlight|shroomlights]] which light up the landscape. The floor is mostly covered with crimson [[nylium]], with occasional patches of bare [[netherrack]] or [[Nether wart block|nether wart blocks]]. [[Crimson Roots|Crimson roots]], [[crimson fungus]], and occasionally warped fungus grow on the ground. Small patches of nether wart blocks and weeping vines can also be found growing on the ceiling.  

[[Hoglin|Hoglins]], [[Piglin|piglins]], [[Zombified piglin|zombified piglins]], and [[Strider|striders]] can spawn in this biome. 
|[[File:Crimson Forest.png|thumb|Crimson forest]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Warped forest]]'''
|{{anchor|Warped forest}}
The warped forest consists of many [[Huge warped fungus|huge warped fungi]], which act as the "trees" of this biome. The huge fungi often generate with [[Shroomlight|shroomlights]], which light up the landscape. [[Twisting Vines|Twisting vines]] grow throughout the biome in patches. The floor is mostly covered with warped [[nylium]], with occasional patches of bare [[netherrack]] or [[warped wart block]]s. [[Warped Roots|Warped roots]], [[warped fungus]], [[Nether Sprouts|nether sprouts]], and occasionally crimson fungus grow on the ground.

[[Endermen]] and [[strider]]s are the only mobs that spawn in this biome. The biome emits out a magenta-purple fog upon entry.  
|[[File:Warped Forest.png|thumb|Warped forest]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Basalt deltas]]'''
|{{anchor|Basalt deltas}}
A gray biome, the basalt deltas are said to be the remnant of ancient volcanic eruptions. The ground consists of [[basalt]] and [[blackstone]] blocks, with small patches of [[netherrack]] and pools of [[lava]]. The shape of the terrain is chaotic and uneven, making it somewhat difficult to traverse and build on. Unlike the other biomes in the Nether, [[bastion remnant]]s do not generate in basalt deltas. When this biome borders a lava ocean, clusters of basalt form near the coast. Fog is colored light-gray and particles of dust can be seen falling from the ceiling upon entry. 

Magma cubes have a high spawn rate in this biome, making the basalt deltas the best place to [[Tutorial:Magma Cube farming|farm magma cream]], and ghasts are also common. This biome also contains a much higher abundance of blackstone compared to other Nether biomes.

=== Generated structures ===
{{Main|Structure#The Nether}}
The Nether contains a variety of unique generated structures. Though equally vast, it contains far fewer types of generated structures than there are in the Overworld.

There are currently 4 generated structures in the Nether:

|-
!Name
! width="500" |Description
!Image
|-
! scope="row" |{{anchor|Nether Fortress}}[[Nether fortress]]
|Nether fortresses are large, castle-like structures that are composed of [[nether bricks]]. This structure is often found bridging over [[lava sea]]s, or tunnelling through [[netherrack]]. 
This structure is the only place where [[blaze]]s and [[wither skeleton]]s spawn, making fortresses the gateway to both bosses in the game: the [[ender dragon]] and the [[wither]]. Fortresses also contain blaze [[monster spawners]], as well as small [[nether wart]] farms. Nether fortresses can be found in all Nether biomes.
|[[File:Nether fortress seen from the Basalt Deltas.png|frameless|A nether fortress bridging over basalt deltas.]]
|-
!{{anchor|Nether Fossil}}[[Nether fossil]]
|Nether fossils are structures comprised of [[bone block]]s that generate within the [[soul sand valley]] biome. These structures have 14 different designs. Unlike [[fossil]]s in the [[Overworld]], [[coal ore]] does not generate within these fossils. There's a possibility that a [[dried ghast]] can be spotted beneath Nether fossils.
|[[File:Soul sand valley fossil.png|frameless|A nether fossil in a soul sand valley.]]
|-
!{{anchor|Bastion Remnant}}[[Bastion remnant]]
|Bastion remnants are large fortifications made up of [[blackstone]], [[blackstone bricks]] and [[basalt]]. A large amount of [[gold block]]s and [[chest|loot chests]] can be found within these structures. They generate in four distinct variants, each with its own unique structure and loot. They are inhabited by [[piglin]]s and [[piglin brute]]s, and in certain variants [[hoglin]]s as well. These structures generate within any Nether biome except for the [[basalt deltas]].
|[[File:Bastion forefront.png|frameless|A bridge bastion remnant in a crimson forest.]]
|-
!{{anchor|Ruined Portal}}[[Ruined portal]]
|A structure containing what appears to be a destroyed [[nether portal]] and various types of [[stone]] or [[blackstone]] materials, when generating in the Overworld or the Nether, respectively. Netherrack generates on the ground around the portal, and a [[chest]] containing loot generates with the structure.
These structures can be found in any Overworld and Nether biome.
|[[File:Nether giant ruined portal.png|frameless|A giant ruined portal in the Nether.]]

=== Terrain features ===
The Nether has a lot of different [[terrain features]] that generate within the biomes of the Nether. 

There are currently 5 terrain features in The Nether:

|-
!{{Anchor|Hidden lava}}[[Spring#Hidden lava|Hidden lava]]
|Single blocks of [[lava]] are buried within [[netherrack]] in all Nether biomes. These are particularly dangerous when mining in the Nether, as the lava can quickly flow out and overwhelm the player when uncovered.
|[[File:HiddenlavainNether.png|frameless|A lava source hidden in netherrack.]]
|}

=== Mobs ===
The Nether is home to its own share of [[mob]]s, most of which are immune to [[fire]] and [[lava]]. [[Skeleton]]s and [[endermen]] are the only [[Overworld]] mobs that can naturally spawn in the Nether; {{in|java}}, baby [[zombified piglin]]s may spawn as [[chicken jockey]]s.

Other Overworld mobs do not naturally spawn in the Nether but can be brought in through portals (except for of the [[wither]] and [[ender dragon]]).

There are currently 12 {{in|je}}, or 11 {{in|be}}, mobs that spawn in this dimension, with 3 additional associated mobs:

*{{EntityLink|Blaze}}
*{{EntityLink|Chicken}}{{only|je|short=1}} (from zombified piglin [[chicken jockey]]s)
*{{EntityLink|Enderman}}
*{{EntityLink|Ghast}}
*{{EntityLink|Hoglin}}

*{{EntityLink|Piglin}}
*{{EntityLink|Piglin Brute}}
*{{EntityLink|Skeleton}}
*{{EntityLink|Strider}}
*{{EntityLink|Wither Skeleton}}
*{{EntityLink|Zombified Piglin}}

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*Upon entering the Nether as a single player, the passage of time freezes in the Overworld and resumes when the player returns unless the {{cmd|forceload}} command is used. This is due to the spawn chunks no longer being ticked, and not [[chunk]]s loading and unloading as some players believe. The spawn chunks are kept loaded when there are no players in the Overworld, but most things other than basic redstone stop working.
*Names considered for the Nether included "Inferno"<ref>{{tweet|notch|28437325743|@DoubleS1928 Inferno's a pretty good name!|October 23, 2010}}</ref>, "the Ways"<ref>{{tweet|notch|28439685286|the ways would be a neat homage to WoT..|October 23, 2010}}</ref>, "the Nexus"<ref>{{tweet|notch|28481318257|not bad! :-D|October 23, 2010}}</ref>, and "the Core"<ref>{{tweet|notch|29088769634|"The Core"! I like that.|October 29, 2010}}</ref>. During development, the names "Hell" and "the Slip" were used as placeholders.
*The numbers for the 3 dimensions are -1=the Nether, 0=Overworld, 1=the End. This contributes to a misconception that the Nether is "below" the Overworld.
** Notch described the "Nether" as a metaphorical name, rather than a reference to the actual physical location of the dimension.<ref>{{tweet|notch|2856039649116160|Metaphorical "down there"! Because it's called the "Nether". *shifty eyes*|November 12, 2010}}</ref>
** Dinnerbone has also confirmed that they are simply separate dimensions.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|1319344791243677697|Separate dimension. It's a common belief but it's not what we're going for, sorry!|October 22, 2020}}</ref>
*{{IN|bedrock}}, if a section of the bedrock ceiling is removed (e.g., through commands) mobs can spawn directly below where the ceiling should be, despite the surface density cap in the Nether being 0.
*{{IN|console}}, the size of the Nether is limited, with bedrock walls surrounding it on all sides. The Overworld-Nether ratio varies depending on the world size: it is 1:3 for Classic and Small worlds, 1:6 for Medium worlds, and 1:8 (the same as ''Java'' and ''Bedrock'' editions) for Large worlds.
*The crimson and warped forest biomes are suggested to decontaminate the Nether environment from potential landfill pollution that coincides with the presence of [[ancient debris]].<ref>{{mcnet|taking-inventory--netherite-scrap|Taking Inventory: Netherite Scrap|March 25, 2021|Duncan Geere}}</ref>
