A '''block of redstone''', internally known as a '''redstone block''', is a mineral [[block]] equivalent to nine [[redstone dust]]. It acts as a permanently powered redstone [[Redstone components#Power components|power source]] that can be pushed by [[piston]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A block of redstone can be mined using any [[pickaxe]] (unlike [[redstone ore]], which requires an iron pickaxe or better).<ref>{{bug|MC-44417|||WAI}}</ref> If mined without a pickaxe, a block of redstone drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Block of Redstone|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
In each [[ancient city]], 2 blocks of redstone can be found integrated into circuitry within a secret room at the city center.

== Usage ==
A block of redstone can be used as a [[Redstone components#Power components|redstone power source]] and can be crafted back into [[redstone dust]]. It can also be used as storage if the player's [[inventory]] is full of redstone dust from mining.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Blocks of redstone can be crafted back into redstone dust, and thus provide compact storage for redstone, like other blocks of materials ([[block of iron]], [[block of gold]], etc.).

=== Redstone component ===
[[File:Block of redstone behavior.png|thumb|A block of redstone powers dust and repeaters, deactivates attached torches, and activate mechanisms (left) – but does not power adjacent opaque blocks (right).]]
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

To place a block of redstone, use the {{control|Place Block}} control.

Blocks of redstone are always active and cannot be turned off. A block of redstone:
* powers any adjacent [[redstone dust]], including above or below, to [[Redstone circuit#Power|power level]] 15
* powers any adjacent [[redstone comparator]]s or [[redstone repeater]]s facing away from the block of redstone to power level 15
* activates any adjacent [[mechanism component]]s ([[door]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.), including above or below, with the exception of [[piston]]s, which cannot be activated by any power source directly in front of them

Adjacent opaque blocks are ''not'' powered.

If a [[redstone torch]] is attached to a block of redstone, it deactivates after {{convert|2|game tick|second}} and does not reactivate (which is normal behavior for a redstone torch attached to a powered block).

A block of redstone can be moved by a piston. [[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around a block of redstone without affecting it.

* As the block of redstone is not fully opaque, [[chest]]s can be opened when covered by one.
