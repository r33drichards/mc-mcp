'''Fire Resistance''' is a [[status effect]] that grants the affected [[entity]] complete immunity to all sources of fire [[damage]].

== Effects ==
Fire Resistance grants immunity to all kinds of fire damage, including [[fire]], [[blaze fireball]]s, [[fire charge]]s, [[magma block]]s, and [[lava]]. It also negates any bonus fire damage from [[bow]]s enchanted with [[Flame]] and [[sword]]s enchanted with [[Fire Aspect]], but the attacks themselves are unaffected.

<i>Fire damage</i> is defined by the game as any [[damage type]] in the <code>minecraft/tags/damage_type/is_fire</code> [[tag]]. Custom damage types defined by [[data packs]] can be added to this tag to allow damage dealt with with the damage type through the {{cmd|damage}} command to be negated by Fire Resistance.

This effect does not work against direct hits/explosions from [[ghast]] fireballs or against melee attacks from a [[blaze]], as neither of these sources are considered to deal fire damage. It does, however, prevent damage from any fire created by a ghast's fireball.

Fire Resistance also reduces the [[fog]] effect created due to being submerged under lava. 

Any [[undead]] mobs that receive Fire Resistance do not take damage from exposure to [[Sun#Effects_on_mobs|sunlight]].

{{IN|bedrock}}, Fire Resistance also prevents the affected targets from catching fire, which stops the fire itself from covering the player's screen.

In [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']], Fire Resistance does ''not'' prevent the affected target from catching fire, but it does prevent any damage that would normally be taken due to being set on fire. This can cause the player (or mob) to start taking damage if the effect expires before said player/mob is able to put themselves out.

Fire Resistance allows [[snow golem]]s to survive in hot [[biome]]s.

*[[Blaze]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[strider]]s, [[warden]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, [[zoglin]]s, and [[zombified piglin]]s are unaffected by Fire Resistance due to already being immune to fire and lava.
