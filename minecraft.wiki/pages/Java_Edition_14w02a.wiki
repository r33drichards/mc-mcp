'''14w02a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on January 9, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109163141/https://mojang.com/2014/01/minecraft-snapshot-14w02a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w02b|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> which adds new stone blocks, the {{cmd|blockdata}} and {{cmd|difficulty}} [[commands]], and the <code>@e</code> selector. This is the first snapshot released in 2014.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Andesite JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Andesite]]'''
* Generates within [[stone]] terrain below Y=80, each in blobs similar in size and abundance to [[gravel]] or [[dirt]].
* Can be crafted with 1 [[cobblestone]] and 1 [[diorite]].
* Can be crafted, with 4 of the raw stone in a 2&times;2 configuration into [[polished andesite]].
* Have the same data value, blast resistance, mining time, and other properties as stone.

'''[[File:Chiseled Stone Bricks JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Chiseled stone bricks]]'''
* Can now be crafted using 2 [[stone brick slab]]s on top of each other, similar to [[chiseled sandstone]].

'''[[File:Diorite JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Diorite]]'''
* Generates within Stone terrain below Y=80, each in blobs similar in size and abundance to gravel or dirt.
* Can be crafted with 2 cobblestone and 2 [[nether quartz]] in a checkboard pattern.
* Can be crafted, with 4 of the raw stone in a 2&times;2 configuration into polished diorite.
* Have the same data value, blast resistance, mining time, and other properties as stone.

'''[[File:Granite JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Granite]]'''
* Generates within Stone terrain below Y=80, each in blobs similar in size and abundance to gravel or dirt.
* Can be crafted with 1 [[nether quartz]] and 1 [[diorite]].
* Can be crafted, with 4 of the raw stone in a 2&times;2 configuration into polished granite.
* Have the same data value, blast resistance, mining time, and other properties as stone.

'''[[File:Mossy Stone Bricks JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Mossy stone bricks]]'''
* Now can be crafted using 1 [[vine]] and 1 stone bricks.

'''{{Animate|Polished Andesite JE1 BE1.png; Polished Diorite JE1 BE1.png; Polished Granite JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Polished andesite]], [[polished diorite]], [[polished granite]]'''
* Can be crafted with four of the respective raw stones in a 2&times;2 configuration.
* Polished forms have the same data value, blast resistance, mining time, and other properties as stone.

'''[[File:Slime Block JE1.png|32px]] [[Slime block]]'''
* Crafted with 9 [[slimeball]]s, can also be crafted back into 9 slimeballs.
* Players, mobs and particles that land on their top side bounce, as if on a trampoline.
** Bounce rebound velocity is scaled by impact velocity.
** A bounce can be avoided by holding spacebar.
* Prevents fall damage.
* Walking on them is slower than walking on soul sand, about the speed of sneaking.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|blockdata}}'''
* Can amend and modify the NBT data of the block at specified coordinates.
** Usage: {{cmd|blockdata <x> <y> <z> <dataTag>}}

'''{{cmd|difficulty}}'''
* Can be used to change the difficulty.

'''[[Target selectors]]'''
* Added <code>@e</code>.
* Can select entities. 
* Can specify type of entity by entity ID to either include or exclude with <code>[type=Chicken]</code> or <code>[type=!Skeleton]</code>. 
** Example: {{cmd|1=kill @e[r=50,type=Chicken]}}.

=== General ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Added a tag that can lock containers.
** Mostly useful for (adventure) maps in Adventure mode.
* Tag in JSON format: <code>{Lock:Key}</code>, containers can be unlocked by clearing their string for Lock (changing it to <code>{Lock:}</code>).
* The lock can be cleared with the command {{cmd|blockdata}}.
* Locked containers can only be opened while holding an item renamed to the given string.
** Example: If the value of the lock tag is "Key" (<code>{Lock:Key}</code>), a player is not able to open the chest unless they are holding an item named ''Key''.
** Item is not removed on use.
** Only works if the item has a custom name (default names do not work).
*** Example: a chest with the tag <code>{Lock:Diamond}</code> cannot be opened when holding a diamond; the item held must be renamed ''Diamond''.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added "That's Numberwang!"

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Anvil]]s'''
* The cost of experience is now reduced.
** Renaming items now only costs 1 level, repairing now starts out with 2 to 5 levels and tools can be repaired longer and with better enchantments, repairing costs can no longer be kept down by renaming items.

'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* When a furnace runs out of fuel, the smelting progress pauses instead of resetting.
** Will be changed in a later snapshot.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1uwewe/tilwhen_a_furnace_runs_out_of_fuel_the_smelting/cemi933</ref>

'''[[Door]]s'''
* Can now stack to 64.
* Crafting recipe now gives 3 doors.

=== Items ===
'''[[Baked potato]]es'''
* Now restore 5 hunger points instead of 6.

'''[[Carrot]]s'''
* Now restore 3 hunger points instead of 4.

=== Mobs ===
'''Baby animals ([[sheep]], [[pig]], [[cow]], [[chicken]], [[cat]], [[wolf]], [[horse]])'''
* All baby animal growth can now slowly be accelerated using the animal's breeding item.
* Baby animals make particles when right-clicked with the proper food.
** It appears holding the right mouse button speeds up the growth-acceleration process.
* They randomly grow up instantly.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now only breed when willing.
** The first time a specific trade is done, the villager becomes willing, any other time there's a 1 in 5 chance the villager becomes willing.
* When a baby villager is born, both parents lose their willingness.
** Finding out a villager's willingness in Survival is difficult: the only way to tell is the amount of XP they give when trading. Normal trading yields 3-6 experience points, trading and making a villager willing yields 8-11 experience points.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Boat]]s'''
* Now break (into sticks and wooden planks) when landing on a solid surface after falling more than 3 blocks.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|clear}}'''
* Can be used to clear only a specific number of items and can be restricted to certain NBT data. 
** Example: {{cmd|clear @p 383 120 34 {display:{Name:Michael<nowiki>}}</nowiki>}} removes up to 34 villager spawn eggs named Michael from player. Note: maximum removal item count does not work correctly (fixed in [[14w02c]]).

'''{{cmd|kill}}'''
* Now has a target selector argument.
* Can kill entities (including players) other than the player that ran the command.
* Can now be used by command blocks.

'''{{cmd|testfor}}'''
* Can now also check for dataTags. 
** Example: {{cmd|testfor @p {foodLevel:20} }}.
* No longer is exclusively usable in command blocks.

'''{{cmd|tellraw}}'''
* A new tag called "insertion" allows text to be inserted into the chat that, when shift-clicked, inserts more text into the players' chat input.
** Example: {{cmd|tellraw @a {text:"CLICK",insertion:"This is a test"} }}.

'''Item IDs'''
* Changed from using numbers (for example, TNT's id was 46) to [[namespaced ID]]s of the form minecraft:item_name. (Example: minecraft:tnt)

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Adventure mode]]'''
* Block interaction is now impossible by default.
* Block outlines do not show unless block can be interacted with.
* Added <code>CanDestroy</code> tag for tools.
* Items with this tag display the names of the blocks that they can destroy in the item tooltip. 
** Example: {{cmd|give @p diamond_shovel 1 0 {CanDestroy:["sand","grass"]}<nowiki/>}} to give a Diamond Shovel that can break grass and sand).

'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Enchanting now costs 1 to 3 levels of experience and lapis lazuli, depending on the tier.
** Player still needs the same minimum levels displayed on the enchantment table to enchant.
* The actual enchantment calculation is the same.
* One of the enchantments is displayed in the tooltip.
* The enchantments player would get do not change until they enchant it, or enchant something else.
** This enchantment seed is stored per player.

'''[[Experience]]'''
* Leveling up now takes more experience.

'''Teleporting'''
* Relative teleporting is smoother and no longer brings players to a stop.
** Preserves their velocity from before the teleport.

'''[[Trading]]'''
* Offers are less random and more useful.
* Existing villagers are not affected.
* Trading now gives experience.
* Villager profession is now displayed in trade GUI.
* Villagers start out with 2-4 trades unlocked.
* The disabled trade arrow now has a descriptive tooltip.
* Trades are now unlocked more freely (no longer requires trading last trade).
* There are now more villager professions (only notable trade changes and additions listed).

=== General ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Messages are now either chat, system or action bar messages.

== Removals ==
=== General ===

* Suspension particles formed inside [[water]] no longer are generated at the wrong positions at high coordinates.
** This bug would also later return in 18w10c.

== Fixes ==
{{fixes|fixedin=14w02a|prefix=Minecraft
|;old
|1178|Invalid biome ID in [[Superflat]] crashes [[Minecraft]].
|2367|[[Player]]s can place and remove arbitrary blocks in [[Adventure]] mode, breaking pre-1.4.2 maps.
|11207|Clicking hotbar hotkey (1-9) to move a stack of items/blocks to [[enchanting table]] deletes all but one of a stack.
}}</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* 14w02a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* As with [[14w02b]] and [[14w02c]], this snapshot has the same protocol version as 1.7.6&ndash;1.7.10. Crossplay is therefore technically compatible between these versions but can cause issues.
