'''Poison''' is an [[effect]] that inflicts [[damage]] over time. It is similar to [[Wither (effect)|Wither]], but it drains health faster and it cannot kill (it does, however, reduce the [[player]]'s health all the way to {{hp|1|poisoned=1}}).

It can be cured by drinking [[milk]], [[Honey Bottle|honey]] or [[medicine|antidote]]{{only|be|edu}}.

== Effect ==
The amount of [[damage]] inflicted to the affected entity is shown in the table below:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
 ! Level !! Ticks per {{hp|1|notag=1}} !! {{hp|1|notag=1}} per second
 |-
 | 1 || 25 || {{hp|0.8}}
 |-
 | 2 || 12 || {{hp|1.66}}
 |-
 | 3<ref group="note" name ="immunity 1">Due to [[damage immunity]], the effective rate of damage is 12 ticks ({{hp|2|notag=1}} × 0.8 per second).</ref> || 6 || {{hp|3.32}}
 |-
 | 4<ref group="note" name="immunity 1"/> || 3 || {{hp|6.66}}
 |-
 | 5+<ref group="note" name ="immunity 2">Due to [[damage immunity]], the effective rate of damage is 10 ticks ({{hp|2|notag=1}} × 1 per second).</ref> || 1 || {{hp|20}}
 |}

{{notelist|columns=1}}

The player's hearts turn dark yellow ({{hp|2|poisoned=1|notag=1}})({{hp|2|notag=1|hardcore=1|poisoned=1}} on [[hardcore mode]]).

The [[damage]] stops when the affected entity is at 1 ({{hp|1|notag=1}}) [[health]], but can resume if healing occurs and the affected entity is at more than 1 ({{hp|1|notag=1}}) [[health]] before the effect expires. 

Amplifiers outside the range 0–31 (corresponding to levels 1–32) are treated [[Wikipedia:Modulo operation|modulo]] 32 (as though reduced by 32 until they are within the range, or alternatively as the remainder from the division by 32, i.e. 33 or 65 is treated as 1).

The effect can be removed by drinking [[milk]] or [[Honey Bottle|honey]]. {{IN|education|bedrock}} when education options are enabled, drinking [[antidote]] also removes poison.

== Trivia ==
*According to most medical and zoological terminology, "poison" specifically refers to a toxin that is delivered to an organism via contact or ingestion. As [[bee]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[Tipped Arrow|poison tipped arrow]]s inject the player with toxins rather, they deliver venom, not poison.
*[[Pufferfish]] are both venomous and poisonous in-game, while real-life pufferfish are poisonous but not venomous, and their spines are used only for intimidation purposes.
