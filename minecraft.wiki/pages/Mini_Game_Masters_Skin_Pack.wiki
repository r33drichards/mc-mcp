'''Mini Game Masters Skin Pack'''<ref>{{Mcnet|mini-game-masters-glide-console|Mini Game Masters Glide onto Console|March 28, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref> is a [[skin pack]] themed around several teams of three characters, each embodying a [[mob]] partaking in some sort of sport, with [[Battle (mini game)|battlers]] wearing armor, [[Glide (mini game)|gliders]] wearing flightsuits, and [[tumble|tumblers]] wearing more conventional athletic gear (somewhat reminiscent of roller derby). This skin pack was released in promotion of the [[mini games]], which were included in the [[Legacy Console Edition]]s.

* Unlike the other teams, which consist of humans dressed in mob-inspired clothing, the zombie team is implied to be made up of actual zombies wearing crude “armor” assembled out of whatever they could find.
