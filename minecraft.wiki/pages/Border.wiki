'''Border''' blocks are unbreakable blocks that prohibit movement through, over or under them.

== Obtaining ==
Border blocks can be obtained only by using [[commands]], or using {{control|pick block}} in [[Creative]] mode. No [[tool]] or [[explosion]] can damage them (they act as if they have no collision box when the player tries).

== Usage ==
Border blocks are generally used to surround an area to prevent students (or [[player]]s) and [[mob]]s from entering it, or to confine them within the surrounded area. They create an invisible, impassable barrier of infinite height above and below themselves (but not sideways). They prevent players who lack the ''[[worldbuilder]]'' ability from doing any of the following:

* Jumping, climbing, tunneling, or swimming over or under them,
* Walking through them,
* Building (placing or destroying blocks) over or under them,
* Destroying the border block.

Most mobs cannot pass over or under border blocks and cannot target a player or other mob through them. However, they do not stop the [[ender dragon]]. Weapons, projectiles, and explosions interact with them as if they were regular walls. Because of this, it is possible to use an [[ender pearl]], [[chorus fruit]], or rideable entity on the other side, to cross one.

Placing or breaking a border block requires the '''worldbuilder''' or '''operator'''{{only|be}} ability, which can be granted to the player by an operator or host.
Border blocks continuously emit red particles.

When used {{in|Bedrock}} without ''Education Edition'' features enabled, border blocks are indestructible, with a height of 1.5 blocks and a width of 1 block.

=== Piston interactivity ===
