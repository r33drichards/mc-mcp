'''The Uncensored Library''' is an unofficial server released by {{Wikipedia|Reporters Without Borders}}, intended as a tool against suppression of the press. The server is built in the image of a large library, with several areas containing banned journalism from many countries.

== Summary ==
Players spawn inside of a gorge on a [[Block of Quartz|quartz]] boardwalk, with a single [[book]] in the inventory, meant to answer frequently asked questions. In front of the player is a [[Light Weighted Pressure Plate|teleporter]] to the library itself, and behind that is a metal sign telling players the server is meant to be in [[creative]]; if they can't [[fly]], they must reconnect. Up a flight of [[Quartz Stairs|stairs]] lead up to a statue of a hand gripping a pen, surrounded by off road forests and a small garden.

The player can reach the library proper by heading north, though to the sides are two outside exhibits, surrounded by gardens lined with [[birch]] trees, pools, hedges, and northward fountains. To the right is {{Wikipedia|Brazil}}, with a construct of a gavel threatening to crush a readable book, explaining it's meant to symbolize rising efforts to suppress the press with lawsuits. To the left is {{Wikipedia|Belarus}}, with a build of a TV made of [[observers]] in a ring of [[fire]]. 

Entering the main building, the player passes by several large [[Quartz Pillar|pillars]] into a ginormous dome area. At the front is a book explaining {{Wikipedia|Iran}}'s extreme repression of the press, with a full exhibit devoted to Iran below. In front of that are several teleporters to individual areas of the server, including one that can only be reached through the warp; {{Wikipedia|Eritrea}}, the country ranked last in the 2020 {{Wikipedia|World Press Freedom Index}}. The area is designed to evoke a jail, with a build in the center made of [[Polished Blackstone Wall|polished blackstone walls]] and [[Chain|chains]], representing journalists being arrested for their integrity.

The main area of the library is a dome, with a large map of the world with each country ranked by their freedom of press, a lectern holding the World Freedom Press Index. Hanging above are each of the 180 countries' respective flags, with statues of books in the corners below. To the east, west, and north of the entrance are halls with exhibits dedicated to several countries. To the east are {{Wikipedia|Mexico}} and {{Wikipedia|Egypt}}, Mexico paying tribute to 12 journalists who were killed by the government, and Egypt with a build of a tipped scale. The west wing consists of {{Wikipedia|Russia}} and {{Wikipedia|Vietnam}}, with a build of a large octopus{{More info|wrap=1}} and a "labyrinth of truth" representing Vietnam's increasing anti-press operations. The final path contains a cage symbolic of {{Wikipedia|Saudi Arabia}} jailing reporters, as well as an area not themed after a country. Instead, the player is instructed to stand behind a lectern in the back, past several seemingly randomly placed [[yellow concrete]] blocks. From the right angle, they form the word truth.

In 2023, the server received a dedicated article on [[Minecraft.net]]. Published without a credited author, the article details the meaning and foundation of the server.<ref name=":pride">{{Mcnet|uncensored-library|The Uncensored Library|November 1, 2023|Staff}}</ref>

In 2024, the server received coverage within the [[15th anniversary]] book [[The World of Minecraft]].

==Trivia==
*The flag used to represent Afghanistan in the dome is still occasionally used to represent the country even though it is no longer official. It also seemingly features a smiley emoticon in place of the emblem (though this could just be an unintentional {{wikipedia|pareidolia}}).
