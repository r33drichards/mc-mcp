== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Occasionally, you’ll find a huge ruined portal, many blocks larger than a standard one. These seem to have once served some kind of ceremonial purpose, though it’s hard to say what that might have been. They’re big enough to fit a ghast through, which raises all kinds of terrifying questions.|Duncan Geere in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/ruined-portal Building Blocks: Ruined Portal]}}

{{Quote|Our geologists first started reporting the discovery of ancient cities after the Wild Update was released in June 2022. They take the form of an enormous, ancient settlement, made up of long corridors and guard towers, some of which contain the riches of the ancient world.|Duncan Geere in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/ancient-city Building Blocks: Ancient City]}}

{{Quote|Essentially, you should think of a woodland mansion as a giant canvas on which you can express yourself – either in fierce combat against the inhabitants, or in rebuilding after you’ve cleared the place out. Or both, of course. Don’t expect that doing either of those things will be easy – but you can be sure that you’ll be proud of the results.|Duncan Geere in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/woodland-mansion Building Blocks: Woodland Mansion]}}

{{Quote|Speaking of loot, there are all kinds of goodies you’ll find in a trial chamber. The vaults are the main event, spawning rare tools, weapons, and armor. You’ll also come across a scattering of chests, barrels and pots containing resources to top you up between fights.|Duncan Geere in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/trial-chamber Building Blocks: Trial Chamber]}}

{{Quote|Be prepared to face some heavy opposition. Ocean monuments are populated by dangerous creatures called guardians that shoot lasers and are spiky enough that hitting them with a melee attack will hurt pretty bad. But they’re nothing compared to the elder guardians that you’ll find in the deepest parts of the structure. As well as the laser and the spikes, these ancient beasts will zap players with Mining Fatigue III, making it very difficult to attack or break blocks. Even an invisibility potion won’t save you from that one.|Duncan Geere in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/ocean-monument Building Blocks: Ocean Monument]}}
