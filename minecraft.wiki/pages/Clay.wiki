'''Clay''' is a block that can be found abundantly in [[lush caves]], in patches in shallow surface water or converted from [[mud]] using [[pointed dripstone]]. It can be [[smelt]]ed into [[terracotta]] or broken into [[clay ball]]s which are smeltable into [[brick]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Clay blocks can be mined with any item, but [[shovel]]s are quickest. Destroying a clay block yields 4 [[clay ball]]s. If broken with a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], it drops itself instead. Destroying a clay block with a tool enchanted with [[Fortune]] does not increase the amount of clay dropped.

=== Natural generation ===
Clay generates in large quantities on the floors of ponds in [[lush caves]].

Clay can also generate in lush caves in the form of [[ore (feature)|blob]]s. Clay attempts to generate 46 times per [[chunk]] in blobs of size 0-160, at any height. It can replace [[stone]], [[granite]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], polished granite{{only|be|short=1}}, polished andesite{{only|be|short=1}}, polished diorite{{only|be|short=1}}, [[tuff]]{{only|je|short=1}}, and [[deepslate]]{{only|je|short=1}}.

Clay is found underwater in [[swamp]]s, [[beach]]es, [[ocean]]s, and at the bottoms of [[river]]s and [[lake]]s in shallow, crystal-shaped [[disk]]s, disregarding adjacency to other types of blocks.

Clay generates in mason houses in [[plains]], [[savanna]], and [[desert]] [[village]]s, and under fisher cottages in [[taiga]] villages.

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a clay block drops the block upon death.

=== Villager gifts ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Raid farming}}
{{IN|Java}}, when the player has the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect, a mason [[villager]] might throw that player a clay block as a gift.

=== Post-generation ===
If [[mud]] is placed above a block with a [[pointed dripstone]] hanging underneath, the mud eventually turns into clay, although the dripstone does not deposit any water into a [[cauldron]]. This conversion does not happen in [[the Nether]].<ref>{{bug|MC-264720||Mud does not convert to clay in Nether with dripstone|WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
[[Big dripleaves]], [[small dripleaves]], [[Mangrove Propagule|mangrove propagules]], [[azalea]]s and [[flowering azalea]]s are the only plants that can be placed on clay. Unlike most other blocks, clay supports small dripleaves even outside of [[water]].

When an azalea or flowering azalea placed on a block of clay is grown into an [[azalea tree]], the clay block turns into [[rooted dirt]].

== Trivia ==
*In real life, clay can actually be reddish-brown, not just gray, and can often be found under the surface and away from sand. This color is reflected in the appearance of [[terracotta]], [[bricks]], and [[flower pot]]s.
