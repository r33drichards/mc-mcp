'''The Word of Notch''' was [[Notch]]'s Tumblr-powered personal blog, which functioned as a development feed for ''[[Minecraft]]''.  

== Biography ==
The Word of Notch could be used to view old ''Minecraft'' blog posts that go all the way back to May 13, 2009, when ''Minecraft'' began development,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20210509000309/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/107315028/cave-game-tech-demo "Cave Game tech demo!"] <small>(archived)</small> – The Word of Notch, May 13, 2009</ref> up to around the [[Adventure Update]], when update content posts from Notch became less frequent. When the blog was no longer used for ''Minecraft'' development, it was removed from the Official links section on the [[Minecraft.net|''Minecraft'' website]]. 

The Word of Notch contained information revealing future updates, as well as daily happenings at the [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] office and behind-the-scenes posts about ''Minecraft'''s history and technical aspects. The blog also contained a direct feed from his Twitter account. After Notch stopped working on ''Minecraft'', his posts were made up of his opinions and daily thoughts or focuses, which were only posted about once every couple of months.

The last post on The Word of Notch was from August 19th, 2013, titled "[https://web.archive.org/web/20210703074234/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/58707926941/so-thats-what-im-going-to-do So that's what I'm going to do]", detailing what his plans were after he cancelled development on the unreleased game {{0x10c}}.

On August 26, 2021, it was discovered that the blog had disappeared, for reasons unknown. Possible explanations may include manual deletion by Notch himself, or Tumblr removing the blog due to it being inactive. Image links from the blog were replaced with disclaimers stating that the content had been removed for "violating Tumblr's community guidelines".{{Citation needed}}
