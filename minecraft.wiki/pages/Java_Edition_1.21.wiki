* They have following properties:
** Toggle their light on or off only when receiving a redstone pulse. Their state does not change if the source of the redstone pulse is removed.
** The block state is readable, allowing the block to function as a [[T flip-flop]]. When the light is on, redstone comparators read a redstone signal strength of 15.
** They don't conduct redstone power.

* Has its own exclusive breaking sound.
* Have 8 variants in 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
** Oxidation can be reversed with an [[axe]].
** [[Honeycomb]] prevents oxidation from occurring.
* Can be [[waterlogged]].
** Acts similarly to waterlogged [[mangrove roots]]; water does not flow out of any of the block's faces.
* They are transparent, so they allow [[light]] to pass through and cannot conduct redstone, prevent mob spawning on top of them, and do not suffocate mobs who end up with their head inside them.

''' {{Animate|Copper Trapdoor.png; Exposed Copper Trapdoor.png; Weathered Copper Trapdoor.png; Oxidized Copper Trapdoor.png|32px}} [[Copper trapdoor]] '''

''' {{Animate|Crafter.png; Crafter Triggered.png; Crafter Crafting.png|32px}} [[Crafter]] '''
* A new [[block]] that enables the [[crafting]] of [[item]]s and blocks via [[redstone]].
* A variant of [[crafting table]], can be crafted with five [[iron ingot]]s, a crafting table, two [[redstone dust]]s, and a [[dropper]] in the crafting table.
{{Crafting Table
|A1=Iron Ingot
|A2=Iron Ingot

}}
* The crafter ejects one crafted item at a time when powered by a new redstone pulse.
** Upon receiving this new pulse, the crafter ejects the result from the front face.
** All the result items are ejected together when the output result has multiple type of items.
* Crafters can be oriented in any direction when placed.
* They have a unique user interface:
** They have a 3×3 interactable crafting grid.
** Their crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand.
*** A "toggled" slot cannot hold any items and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks such as [[hopper]]s and [[dropper]]s.
*** A "toggled" slot can be toggled off by player, whether clicked directly or holding item(s), pressing slot keys associated with an empty or a not empty hotbar slot.
** Unlike the [[crafting table]], the slots display a preview of the item to be crafted and ejected on the next redstone pulse, but cannot be manually taken out by the player.
** The user interface is shared between all players interacting with them, meaning that multiple players can interact with them at the same time, similar to [[chest]]s and hoppers.
** The user interface does not have a [[recipe book]] to provide help, so the player must know the recipes.
* They interact with other blocks in the following ways:
** When read by a [[redstone comparator]], the redstone signal strength is 0 to 9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength.
** Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull items out of them.
** Droppers can be used to insert items into them.
** Moving items in from another block with a [[hopper]] or a [[dropper]] prioritizes filling items into slots following these rules:
*** Crafters prioritize the first empty slot from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
*** If there are no empty slots then crafters prioritize the smallest stack of the same item and pick the first if there are multiple.
*** If there is a toggled slot, it is skipped. The item is then moved into the [[container]].
*** If the item cannot be moved, it is ejected into the [[world]].
** If failed to select a slot, hoppers and droppers do not take any action.
* A [[pickaxe]] can increase the speed of mining them.

''' [[File:Heavy Core JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Heavy core]] '''
* A mysterious, dense block that can be combined with a [[breeze rod]] to craft a [[mace]].
* The heavy core block has a 7.5% chance of being rewarded when using a [[ominous trial key]] on a [[ominous vault]] in the [[trial chambers]].
* When placed, it has the same size as a [[player head]], and can be oriented in 12 directions.
* Mining a heavy core is slow - it takes 15 seconds to mine.
** The appropriate tool is the pickaxe.
* Are resistant to explosions: blast resistance matches the one from [[obsidian]].
* Can be waterlogged.
* Epic rarity.

''' {{Animate|Ominous Trial Spawner (active) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Trial Spawner (ejecting) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Trial Spawner (inactive) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Ominous trial spawner]] '''
* A more powerful active phase of the trial spawner with unique challenges and rewards.
** Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards.
* If a trial spawner detects a player that has the Trial Omen effect, the spawner becomes ominous if:
** It is not in cooldown.
** Or, it is in cooldown but was not ominous during its last activation.
*** Making it ominous this way bypasses the cooldown.
* While active, it:
** Glows blue instead of orange.
** Emits soul flames instead of normal flames.
** Commonly spawns mobs with equipment if they can wear it.
*** Mobs that can wear equipment often spawn with enchanted weapons and armor.
**** Armor enchantments include Protection IV, Projectile Protection IV and Fire Protection IV.
**** Weapon enchantments include Sharpness I, Knockback I, Power I and Punch I.
*** The armor these mobs wear have [[armor trim]]s applied from the trial chambers.
** Periodically spawn potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs.
*** Based on their location, spawners in an area select a random set of projectiles to spawn.
*** These projectiles always include a single type of [[lingering potion]] from a set of possible effects.
*** Players are chosen 50% of the time when an ominous trial spawner chooses which entity to drop projectiles on top of.
* Becoming ominous despawns any existing mobs it spawned and reset its challenge.
** It remains ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished.
** Mobs removed by a trial spawner converting to ominous state drop any items they previously picked up from the ground.
* When defeated, it ejects a different set of loot to normal trial spawners.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-trial-spawner-ominous}}
* Ominous trial keys have a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated ominous trial spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject trial keys.

''' {{Animate|Ominous Vault (inactive) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Vault (active) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Vault (unlocking) JE1 BE1.png; Ominous Vault (ejecting) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Ominous vault]] '''
* A variant of vaults that have a different texture and emit soul flames instead of normal flames.
* These can be found throughout the [[trial chambers]] in harder to find places and require an ominous trial key to unlock.
* These vaults hold a more valuable set of rewards than the standard vaults unlocked by trial keys.
* Ominous vaults can provide some particularly valuable items.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-reward-ominous}}

''' [[File:Polished Tuff.png|32px]] [[Polished tuff]] '''

''' {{Animate|Trial Spawner.png; Active Trial Spawner.png; Ejecting Trial Spawner.png|32px}} [[Trial spawner]] '''
* Generates in [[trial chambers]].
* The trial spawner is a new form of [[spawner]] that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in [[multiplayer]].
* The challenge level increases for each new player a trial spawner notices nearby.
** Challenge level does not decrease until it is reset during a trial spawner's cooldown.
* Unlike [[monster spawner]]s, a trial spawner spawns a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level.
** It can spawn a mob only at positions that are within line of sight.
** It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has.
** Spawned mobs are persistent and does not despawn.
* Once all mobs are defeated, the trial spawner ejects a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level.
** After the rewards have been ejected, the trial spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it no longer spawns mobs.
{{LootChest|trial-chambers-trial-spawner}}
* Trial spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in [[Survival]] - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout [[trial chambers]].
* Trial spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and does not drop even with [[Silk Touch]].
* When placed in [[Creative]], trial spawners have no mob type set by default.
** The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a [[spawn egg]].
* Players in Creative or [[Spectator]] mode are not detected or noticed by trial spawners.

''' {{Animate|Vault.png; Vault (active).png; Vault (unlocking).png; Vault (ejecting).png|32px}} [[Vault]] '''
* A block containing loot that can be unlocked with [[trial key]]s, found throughout [[trial chambers]].
** {{control|Using}} a trial key on a vault unlocks it, making it eject loot.
* Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players.
** It can be activated once per [[player]]. After a player has unlocked a vault, they cannot unlock that vault again.
** If a player has not unlocked that vault before, an orange stream of particles flows from the player to the vault when nearby.

{{Crafting Table
|B2=Breeze Rod
|Output=Wind Charge, 4
}}
* Can be shot from a [[dispenser]] or thrown by a [[player]].
* When used, it fires off a wind charge projectile similar to the [[breeze]].
* A wind charge fired by a player grants 10% more knockback than a breeze's, but have a much smaller area of impact.
* Just like the [[projectile]] fired by the [[breeze]], wind charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly, and they activate [[redstone]] components.
* There is a half-second cooldown after each use.
* Players that launch themselves with a wind charge accumulate fall damage only below the [[Altitude|Y-level]] of where they collided with the wind burst.

=== Mobs ===
''' [[File:Bogged JE2 BE2.png|x32px]] [[Bogged]] '''
* A new, mossy and mushroom covered variant of the [[skeleton]] that shoots poisonous arrows.
** They're faster to take down with {{hp|16}} health instead of {{hp|20}} health.
** They attack at a slower interval of {{convert|3.5|seconds|ticks}} instead of skeletons' {{convert|2|seconds|ticks}}.
* Has a chance to drop [[arrows of Poison]] when killed by [[player]]s.
* The mushrooms on its head can be sheared to give 1-2 [[brown mushroom]]s and 1-2 [[red mushroom]]s.
* They spawn naturally in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s.
** They're somewhat rare, with their spawn chance being half of that of the skeleton.
** As opposed to [[stray]]s and [[husk]]s, bogged do not require sky access to spawn, and they can also spawn in caves.
* Can also be found spawning from [[trial spawner]]s in some [[trial chambers]].

''' [[File:Breeze JE1.webp|x32px]] [[Breeze]] '''
* The Breeze is a cunning, hostile [[mob]] that can spawn via [[trial spawner]]s in some rooms within the [[trial chambers]].
* Has {{hp|30}} health points.
* The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances.
** Avoids jumping into dangerous blocks or air.
* An aggressive adversary, the breeze shoots [[wind charge]] projectiles at its target.
** Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an [[entity]].
** After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks.
* Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
** Non-iron [[door]]s and [[trapdoor]]s are flipped.
** [[Fence gate]]s are flipped.
** [[Button]]s are pressed.
** [[Lever]]s are flipped.
** [[Bell]]s are rung and swung.
** Lit [[candle]]s (both standalone and on [[cake]]) are extinguished.
* Wind bursts do not have any effect on iron doors, iron trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a redstone signal.
* Is aggressive toward [[iron golem]]s in addition to players.
* Does not retaliate against attacks from [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[slime]]s. These mobs do not retaliate when damaged by a breeze.
* Breezes deflect all projectiles.
** Deflected projectiles deflect in the direction of the shooter. Unlike a shield, projectiles retain their velocity after the deflection.
* Drops 1-2 [[breeze rod]]s when killed by a player.
** The number of breeze rods dropped is affected by [[Looting]] enchantment.

=== Non-mob entities ===
''' [[File:Wind Charge JE2 BE2.webp|x32px]] [[Wind charge]] '''
* Fired by the [[breeze]] and players who use the wind charge item.
* Explodes upon impact, emitting a large burst of gust [[particles]] and [[Knockback (mechanic)|knocking]] entities back similar to a TNT explosion.
* Its explosion interacts with certain blocks, including [[button]]s and [[trapdoor]]s.
* Deals damage when colliding directly with a player or mob.
* Wind charges break [[decorated pot]] and [[chorus flower]]s upon collision.
* Can be deflected, just like [[fireball]]s.

=== World generation ===
''' [[File:Isometric Chamber-6.png|x32px]] [[Trial chambers]] '''
* Trial chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game.
** Trial chambers are made out of a variety of [[copper]] and [[tuff]] blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small.
** Trial chambers are fairly common under [[deepslate]] layers underground.
* The layout of each trial chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, rewards, and a variety of combat spaces.
** Traps include dispensers containing different potential items, such as [[arrow]]s or [[fire charge]]s.
** Supply chests can be found between the different rooms, and give the player blocks and items that help them navigate their trials.
** [[Decorated pot]]s generate around the trial chambers, and can be smashed open to find a little loot inside. Some pots are decorated and others are blank.
** [[Vault]]s and [[ominous vault]]s are guarded by combat challenges in most rooms, and require a [[trial key]] or [[ominous trial key]] to be opened. They can be a source of many high level enchanted books, consumables, and equipment.
** Some rooms include hidden areas that can contain chests, beds for players to set their respawn point, and vaults. Some also contain passageways that players can [[crawl]] through and lead to other rooms.
* Each trial chamber includes trial spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:

* Each trial spawner category uses one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each trial chamber.
** For example, one trial chamber might spawn only [[zombie]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[stray]]s, while another might spawn only [[spider]]s, [[silverfish]], and [[skeleton]]s.
** The exceptions to this are some trial spawners in unique rooms that always spawn [[breeze]]s.
* Regular mob spawning does not happen inside the bounding boxes of the trial chamber pieces.

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[Advancement]]s '''
* Added eight new advancements.
{{Load advancements|Minecraft: Trial(s) Edition;Under Lock and Key;Blowback;Who Needs Rockets?;Crafters Crafting Crafters;Lighten Up;Over-Overkill;Revaulting}}

''' [[Effect]]s '''
* [[File:Infested.png|32px]] [[Infested]]
** Affected entities have a 10% chance to spawn 1-2 [[silverfish]] when hurt.
** Silverfish spawn at the center of the entity's bounding box and fling out in the direction the entity is facing.
** Silverfish cannot get this effect.

* [[File:Oozing.png|32px]] [[Oozing]]
** Affected entities spawn two [[slime]]s upon death.
** Spawns only slimes in a given 5×5×5 area up to the maximum entity cramming count.
** Slimes cannot get this effect.

* [[File:Raid Omen JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Raid Omen]]
** A variant that Bad Omen can transform into if the player enters a village.
** It has a duration of 30 seconds.
** Once the Raid Omen expires, a raid starts at the location where the player gained the Raid Omen.

* [[File:Trial Omen.png|32px]] [[Trial Omen]]
** A variant that Bad Omen can transform into if the player is within detection range of a [[trial spawner]] that is not ominous.
** The Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level.
** Players that have Trial Omen are surrounded by ominous particles.

* [[File:Weaving.png|32px]] [[Weaving]]
** Affected entities spread 2-3 [[cobweb]] blocks upon death.
** Non-player entities with this effect can walk through [[cobweb]] at normal speeds.
** Players are affected by the movement buff through cobwebs, affecting 50% of their normal speed instead of 25%.

* [[File:Wind Charged.png|32px]] [[Wind Charged]]
** Affected entities emit a wind burst upon death.

''' [[Enchantments]] '''
* Three new enchantments have been introduced that are unique to the [[mace]]. Each mace can have only one of these enchantments.
** [[Breach]]
*** Rare enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
*** Has 4 levels.
*** Reduces the effectiveness of the [[armor]] on the target. The armor's effectiveness is reduced by 15% per level.
** [[Density]]
*** Common enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
*** Has 5 levels.
*** Increases the damage dealt per block fallen with a mace, increasing by 0.5 per level.
** [[Wind Burst]]
*** Unique enchantment that can be found only in [[ominous vault]]s.
*** Has 3 levels.
*** Emits a burst of wind (like that of a [[wind charge]]) upon executing a mace smash attack on an entity, launching the attacker upward. It can be used to chain smash attacks together, and the strength of the launch increases per level.
*** Each level bounces the attacker higher up in the air: it bounces the player a further 7 blocks up per enchantment level, for 21 blocks at level 3.
*** The launch strength of Wind Burst is much stronger in ''Bedrock Edition'' than in ''Java Edition''.

''' [[Ominous event]]s '''
* [[Bad Omen]] has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in the trial chambers.
* These optional experiences accessed through Bad Omen are now known as ominous events.
** They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways.
** Illager [[raid]]s are an example of an existing ominous event.
* Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
** It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player.
** It no longer triggers a raid directly when entering a village.
*** Instead, it transforms into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds.
*** Once the Raid Omen expires, a raid starts at the location where the player gained the Raid Omen.
*** Like any other effect, players can drink a bucket of milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the raid from starting.
** It is no longer given to players that defeat a raid captain outside a raid.
*** Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new ominous bottle.

=== General ===

''' Enchantments '''
* Enchantments are now set through data. An enchantment is a set of core properties like level ranges and cost together with some effects. Most effect types also support a set of conditions, making it possible to apply them only when certain criteria are met.
* Enchantments can be added in the registry enchantment. All Vanilla Enchantments can be found in the vanilla datapack in the client and server jar files.
* Fields:
** <code>description</code>: The name of the Enchantment when displayed in text represented as a Text Component.
** <code>exclusive_set</code>: The Enchantment(s) this Enchantment is exclusive with.
*** Two Enchantments can never co-exist on an item if either is in the other's exclusive set.

**** This is postfixed with the slot name when the enchanted item is equipped in a slot.
**** Must be unique to avoid different enchantments (or other systems) interfering with each others.

'''Level-Based Values '''
* Many effects of Enchantments depend on the level of the Enchantment. For these fields, a type called Level-Based Values is used. In their most basic form, Level-Based Values can be written as floating-point constants, which is interpreted as a value that isn't in fact level-based, the constant is used as-is for all levels.
*If a Level-Based value is not a floating-point constant, it is an object with a type field, specifying one of the following types:
** <code>linear</code>
*** The most common type of Level-Based Value is a linear value. A linear Level-Based Value has two fields:
**** <code>base</code>: The base value added to all levels
**** <code>per_level_above_first</code>: Amount added for each level above the first one
*** In effect, a <code>linear</code> Level-Based Value results in <math>base + per\_level\_above\_first * (level - 1)</math>.
** <code>clamped</code>
*** A Level-Based Value type that clamps a value between a min and max. Fields:
**** <code>value</code>: A Level-Based Value used as the input
**** <code>min</code>: A floating point value specifying the minimum value of the output
**** <code>max</code>: A floating point value specifying the maximum value of the output
** <code>fraction</code>
*** A Level-Based Value type that represents the fraction between two values. Fields:
**** <code>numerator</code>: A Level-Based Value used as the numerator
**** <code>denominator</code>: A Level-Based Value used as the denominator
** <code>levels_squared</code>
*** A Level-Based Value type that evaluates to the square of the levels, plus an addition. Fields:
**** <code>added</code>: A floating-point value added to the result of the squared levels
*** In effect, a levels_squared Level-Based Value results in <math>level ^ 2 + added</math>

''' Value Effect Types '''
* Value Effects are effects used to manipulate the amount of something in the game.
** <code>add</code>
*** A Value Effect that adds a value to the processed results.
*** Fields:
**** <code>value</code>: A Level-Based Value determining how much to add
*** Negative values are supported

**** The span is 0 to 1, with 0 being no chance to drop an input value and 1 dropping all input values
** <code>set</code>
*** A Value Effect that overwrites the input value with a given Level-Based Value.
*** Fields:
**** <code>value</code>: The Level-Based Value to use as the result

''' [[Attributes]] '''
* Attribute modifiers no longer have a UUID and name combination.
* Instead, attribute modifiers are now uniquely identified by a namespaced ID, similar to other resources.
* The ID of a modifier uniquely identifies it in the set of modifiers for a single attribute.
** Using the same ID for different modifiers is allowed as long as the modifiers are for different attributes.
* Existing built-in modifiers are upgraded to new IDs.
* Existing custom modifiers are upgraded to the GUID as an ID in the <code>minecraft</code> namespace.

''' Item Stack Attribute Modifiers '''
* The <code>uuid</code> and <code>name</code> fields have been removed.
* Attribute Modifiers now have an <code>id</code> (namespaced ID) field.
** This is a unique identifier per attribute for the modifier.

''' Entity Attributes '''
* Attributes are now stored as attributes
* Attribute format:
** <code>id</code>, renamed from <code>Name</code>.
** <code>base</code>, renamed from <code>Base</code>.
** <code>modifiers</code>, renamed from <code>Modifiers</code>.
*** Now stores modifiers in the same format as modifiers in <code>attribute_modifiers</code> item stack components:
**** <code>id</code>, replaces <code>UUID</code> and <code>Name</code>.
**** <code>amount</code>, renamed from <code>Amount</code>.
**** <code>operation</code>, renamed from <code>Operation</code>, now a named constant instead of an int:
***** <code>add_value</code> - previously 0.
***** <code>add_multiplied_base</code> - previously 1.
***** <code>add_multiplied_total</code> - previously 2.

'''Attribute Effects '''

* All Entity Effect types can also be used as Location-Based Effects, and in addition <code>attribute</code> can be used to specify an Attribute Effect as a location-based effect.

''' Effect Conditions '''
* Most Enchantment effects are filtered using Conditions (same types as in loot tables). This enables effects to be specific for different situations. Each Effect Component defines which parameters are available for the condition to evaluate - some parameters are available for all of these parameter sets, while some are specific to a certain set. Each effect component specifies which parameters are available in the Effect Components list below.

* Damage Parameters
**Entities: <code>this</code>, <code>attacker</code>, <code>direct_attacker</code>
**Enchantment Level
**Origin
**Damage Source

*Item Parameters

'''Effect Components '''
*The <code>effects</code> field in an Enchantment is a map of Effect Component type the Effect List data. Most Effect Components are lists, so any number of Effects can be added of any Component Type. The data for each effect generally involves having a specified condition context and Effect Type, but some Effects also deviate from this format.
*In cases where the documentation specifies a Condition Context and Effect, the Component is a list. Each entry in the list has a field named <code>effect</code> with the effect of the type used by the list. Entries can also optionally include a field named <code>requirements</code> specifying the condition parameters, which are then evaluated with the documented context.

* 1.21 is the last major version to use the 1.''x'' [[version format]].
* This update has the shortest time span between the first [[snapshot]] and the change of its [[Historical panoramas#Tricky Trials|panorama]], as both were changed in the same snapshot.
* Since [[Java Edition 1.5]], there have been no major updates until this one that didn't add or change any [[splash]]es to the game.
* If all subsequent drops are counted (up to 1.21.11), 1.21 is the largest major update, adding 159 blocks, 155 items (including 5 music discs), 10 mobs, 1 structure, 1 biome, 8 advancements and fixing 1143 bugs.
* This update has the most releases in its update cycle, currently standing at 12 (including itself).
* With the release of only game drops in the 1.21.''x'' format, 2025 becomes the first year since 2015 with no major updates to ''Java Edition'' released.
