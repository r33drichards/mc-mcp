The '''modified jungle edge''' or '''jungle edge mutated''' was a rare variant of the [[jungle edge]] biome that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
The modified jungle edge featured the same smooth transition and lowered tree density that regular jungle edges had, though with much more mountainous terrain and occasional overhangs, like the [[Modified Jungle|modified jungle]]. [[Ocelot|Ocelots]], [[Parrot|parrots]], and [[Panda|pandas]] spawned in this biome, but jungle pyramids didn't generate here. {{IN|BE}}, some [[Bamboo (feature)|bamboo]] plants generated here.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], modified jungle edges use a strong humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which fades the distance in an orange tint. Modified jungle edges have warm atmospherics, lighting, and color grading, which makes the biome look more humid and warm.

The modified jungle edge generated only in strict conditions, and it was the rarest biome in the game. 

If a [[jungle]] biome bordered a rare [[swamp hills]] biome,<ref>{{bug|MC-140151||Modified Jungle Edge biomes only generate when a Jungle borders a Swamp Hills biome|Fixed}}</ref> then the modified jungle edge spawned as part of a double-layered transition, with a thin regular jungle edge bordering the swamp hills, and the modified jungle edge bordering the jungle. As both jungles and swamp hills were already rare, and even more rarely did they generate bordering each other, the conditions for a modified jungle edge to generate were extremely rarely met. 

When they actually did manage to generate, they were often just a few hundred blocks in length, but in some cases were less than 10 blocks, making them one of the smallest biomes as well, covering only a few millionths (0.00027%) of the overworld by area.

== Mobs ==
Modified jungle edges used the same mob spawning chances as jungle edges.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
