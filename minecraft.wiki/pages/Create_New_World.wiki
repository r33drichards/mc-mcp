[[File:Ore UI - Create New World Screen Menu "General" Tab Settings (Bedrock).png|thumb|The create new world screen {{In|be}}.]]
The create new world screen can be opened by pressing "Create new world" in the "Worlds" tab of the [[play screen]], and selecting a [[Marketplace]] template or the create new world button. The create new world screen can also be opened from the purchase screen of world templates in the Marketplace.

The menu shows a thumbnail with some buttons and a tab list on the left, and the world options for each selected tab on the right. The world thumbnail is either a default image, the image for the selected [[flat world]] preset or [[seed template]], or the thumbnail of the Marketplace template.

| Returns to the previously opened [[menu screen]], usually the "Create from..." screen in the [[play screen]] for local worlds. Changes made to the world options will not be saved when leaving the create new world screen.
|-

Selecting a Realms server will show a selection screen with three available world slots where the world can be stored. If a world already exists in the slot, the world will be replaced with the new world.
|}
Below, there are seven sections which open the respective world options on the right: General, Advanced, Multiplayer, Cheats, Resource packs, Behavior packs, and Experiments.

When the world is being created from a Marketplace template, some options may be locked by the creator. The options can be unlocked by selecting the message at the top, but this may result in different gameplay than the creator intended for the template.

Some options and custom [[add-ons]] may permanently disable [[achievements]] for the world, which are shown with a message on the top. Enabling [[Hardcore]] mode, add-ons, or [[experiments]] shows a warning message as well.
