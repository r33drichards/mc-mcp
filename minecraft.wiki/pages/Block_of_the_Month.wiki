== Quotes ==
{{Quote|What are the ingredients that you’d mix together to make Minecraft? Mining and crafting are the basics, obviously. A big helping of exploration. A dash of building, and a sprinkle of combat. Pinches of farming and trading. Perhaps even a soupçon of enchanting and automation.|[[Duncan Geere]] in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/cauldron Block of the Month: Cauldron]}}

{{Quote|Right now, Mojang Studios' top nutritionists don’t recommend eating iron blocks. But you never know what that advice might change – so it’s probably best to stockpile some in your chests. Just in case. |[[Duncan Geere]] in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-iron Block of the Month: Block of Iron]}}

{{Quote|Want a vault for yourself? Well sorry, you can’t have one. At least, not in survival mode. Vaults take forever to break, and when they do they drop nothing - even with a Silk Touch enchantment. No – they can’t be moved with pistons either.|[[Duncan Geere]] in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/vault Block of the Month: Vault]}}

{{Quote|You might think that gathering nylium of either variety is easy. Whack it with a pickaxe, right? But it turns out that the fungal matter it contains is pretty fragile, so in order to collect it, you’ll need to use a silk touch pickaxe. If you lack the sophisticated tool for the job, it can also occasionally be found in hoglin stables in bastion remnants.|[[Duncan Geere]] in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/block-month--nylium Block of the Month: Nylium]}}

{{Quote|In Minecraft, you won’t need to wait that long but it’s still not fast. A few in-game weeks should do the trick. But don’t rush it! Sit back, and enjoy the slow, beautiful process of chemistry in action.|Duncan Geere in [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/weathered-copper Block of the Month: Weathered Copper]}}
