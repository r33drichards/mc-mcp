{{Q|“Dreiton” is a remembrance of the times when I wrote albums like Zweitonegoismus. When I was still scared to embrace minimalism and simplicity in music. When I was still keen on making my music as crazy and varied as possible. Turns out there was no reason to have such a fear. And with “Dreiton”, the are essentially only two sections on a song that clocks in at over 8 minutes. I hope I accomplished to have repetition that nonetheless isn’t boring in any way. Like all the other “creative mode” songs, this one is also about the awe of the creativity to be found in Minecraft. At minute 7, the song abruptly builds up to nothing and fades away. Sometimes creativity doesn’t need to have a reason. Sometimes you just build.|C418|c418.org}}

== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Dreiton.ogg]]

"Dreiton" opens with distant, chiptune-style synthesizers playing a simple rhythm and makes use of pan drums as an accompaniment. Some parts have more of a focus on the pan drums for the melody and sound very similar to "[[Aria Math]]".

The track has a slow rhythm that slowly increases in volume and then suddenly quiets down again, slowly crescendoing with loud brass and strings until dramatically quieting into a guitar piece.
