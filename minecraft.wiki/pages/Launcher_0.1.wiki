'''0.1''' is the first major [[launcher]] version released on April 18, 2013, replacing the old launcher used since [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] for [[Horse Update|1.6.1]].

== Changes ==

* [[.minecraft]] directory structure is changed:
** "assets" folder; stores resources such as language packs and sounds.
*** All [[Music Discs|music discs]] now use .ogg format instead of .mus format.
** "library" folder; stores Java libraries such as LWJGL and jinput.jar.
** "versions" folder; there are file "versions.json" (meta data) and folders that stores [[minecraft.jar]] for each versions (but its name is same as its version. e.g. for 13w16a, "versions/13w16a/13w16a.jar").
* Libraries and [[Client.jar|minecraft.jar]] are now separate.
* The launcher is an executable.
