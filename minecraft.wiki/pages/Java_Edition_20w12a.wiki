'''20w12a''' is the seventh snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on March 18, 2020,<ref name="20w12a">{{snap|20w12a|March 18, 2020}}</ref> which adds [[respawn anchor]]s and [[polished basalt]], as well as several other changes and fixes.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Polished Basalt (UD) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Polished basalt]]'''
* Obtained by smelting normal [[basalt]].
* Purely decorative and directional, like normal basalt.

'''{{Animate|Respawn Anchor (0) JE1.png; Respawn Anchor Charges 1 JE1 BE1.gif; Respawn Anchor Charges 2 JE1 BE1.gif; Respawn Anchor Charges 3 JE1 BE1.gif; Respawn Anchor Charges 4 JE1 BE1.gif|32px}} [[Respawn anchor]]'''
* Crafted with 6 [[crying obsidian]] and 3 [[glowstone]].
* Can be used to set spawn points using glowstone as charges.
* A maximum of 4 charges can be set at once, and one charge is depleted with each respawn.
* Emits a slight amount of light, which gets stronger for each charge added.
* Using it in the Overworld or the End causes it to explode and set fire to surrounding blocks.
* When charged, a [[redstone comparator]] gives a signal depending on the number of charges.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Added ambient, interaction and other sounds for the [[respawn anchor]].{{more info|List of sound events & situations the sounds play in.}}

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>soul_fire_base_blocks</code> block tag.
** Contains [[soul sand]] and [[soul soil]].
** Determines what blocks can support [[soul fire]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Nether gold ore]]'''
* Can now be mined with any [[pickaxe]].
* Now drops 2–6 [[gold nugget]]s, instead of itself, when mined.
** This is affected by [[Fortune]] the same way other ores are, for a maximum possible drop of 24 golden nuggets with Fortune III.
** Nether gold ore, obtained with [[Silk Touch]], can still be smelted into a single [[gold ingot]].

'''[[Soul fire]]'''
* Now burns on [[soul sand]] in addition to [[soul soil]].

'''[[Twisting vines]] and [[weeping vines]]'''
* Are no longer replaced when an attempt is made to place another block in the same spot.

=== Items ===
'''[[Nether fungus]], [[crimson roots]], [[warped roots]], and [[nether sprouts]]'''
* Can appear if [[bone meal]] is used on a nylium block.
** Crimson nylium grows vegetation from the [[crimson forest]].
** Warped nylium grows vegetation from both the crimson forest and [[warped forest]].

'''[[Hoe]]s'''
* Are now the appropriate [[tool]]s for mining [[sponge]]s and [[wet sponge]]s.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bee]]s'''
* Reduced the maximum distance a bee can wander away from its home hive when randomly wandering to around 22 blocks.

'''[[Hoglin]]s'''
* Tweaked attack range.

'''[[Parrot]]s'''
* Imitate hostile mobs less often.
* Don't randomly imitate hostile mobs on Peaceful difficulty.

'''[[Piglin]]s'''
* Baby piglins can now sit on other baby piglins riding hoglins, up to a stack of 3 baby piglins.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|spawnpoint}}'''
* Now supports being run in any dimension.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Hoglins are now required for the Two by Two advancement.
* The "Sweet Dreams" advancement's description has changed from "Change your respawn point" to "Sleep in a bed to change your respawn point."

'''[[Ambience]]'''
* New mood detection algorithm for cave sounds.
** Aims to make ambient cave sounds play at more appropriate moments.
*** Mood increases the longer a player remains underground.
*** Mood increases the longer a player remains without or in low sky [[light]] or block light.{{more info|What exactly are the parameters for increasing the mood? How deep underground? How dark? How and at which rate does the mood increase faster depending on how deep underground you are or how low the light level is?}}
*** Mood decreases and eventually resets the longer a player is neither underground nor in the absence of light.
** Player can check the percentage of the mood in the sounds info section in the [[debug screen]].
*** When the mood percentage reaches 100%, an ambient cave sound plays.

'''[[Fishing]]'''
* When fishing, treasure loot can now only be obtained by fishing in open waters.
** A fishing location is considered to be open water if the following conditions are met:
*** There is at least a 5×1×5 area of water beneath the bobber and a 5×2×5 area of air above (for a combined 5×3×5 free area required).
*** Waterlogged blocks that have no collision, such as [[sign]]s and [[coral]], count as water. However, bubble columns do not.

'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* The sign recipes are now grouped.
* The netherite ingot recipes are now grouped.

'''Farming [[chorus plant]]s, [[bamboo]], [[sugar cane]] and other plants'''
* 0-tick farm functionality is removed.<ref>{{bug|MC-113809}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Chat]] messages'''
* Changed "Your home bed was missing or obstructed" to "You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed".

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added <code>fishing_hook</code> sub-predicate.
** Checks properties of the fishing hook.
** <code>in_open_water</code> parameter matches whether the fishing location is open water fishing or not.

'''[[Material]]s'''
* Weeping and twisting vines now use the "plant" material.
* [[Shroomlight]]s now use the "grass" material.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* [[Bone meal]] particles now use 64-bit floats for spawning, not 32-bit.<ref>{{bug|MC-76810}}</ref>
** This means that using bone meal at high distances from the world origin (notably greater than 17 million) causes the particles to appear in expected places, and not far away from the target.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* The <code>gold_ores</code> block tag is no longer used in setting the required pickaxe [[tier]].

'''UUIDs'''
* UUIDs stored in NBT are now represented as an array of four integers, rather than <code>UUIDMost</code>/<code>UUIDLeast</code>.
** Example: <code>{UUID:[I;1498693494,1027158888,1898994005,860320107]}</code>
** Renamed a couple of fields:
*** <code>OwnerUUID</code> of tamed animals, area effect clouds, evoker fangs and projectiles is now simply <code>Owner</code>.
*** <code>TrustedUUIDs</code> of foxes is now <code>Trusted</code>.
*** <code>target_uuid</code> of conduits is now <code>Target</code>.
