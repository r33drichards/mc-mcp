'''12w18a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], released on May 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505012639/http://www.mojang.com/2012/05/minecraft-snapshot-12w18a/|title=Minecraft Snapshot 12w18a|website=Mojang.com|date=May 3, 2012|author=[[Jens Bergensten]]}}</ref>

This is the first version that makes singleplayer worlds run on a local server, resulting in the use of separate threads for rendering logic and world logic. This change resulted in a [[Java Edition 1.3.1/List of broken features|large number of broken features]], some of which are yet to be fixed in the latest version, and on weak computers can result in server-lag in singleplayer.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
{{Animate|Oak Log (UD) JE5 BE2.png;Birch_Log_(UD)_JE1_BE1.png;Spruce_Log_(UD)_JE1_BE1.png;Jungle_Log_(UD)_JE1_BE1.png|36px}} 
{{Animate|Oak Leaves JE3 BE4.png;Birch Leaves JE1 BE2.png;Spruce Leaves JE1 BE2.png;Jungle Leaves JE1 BE2.png|36px}} {{Animate|Oak_Planks_JE4_BE2.png;Birch_Planks_JE1_BE1.png;Spruce_Planks_JE1_BE1.png;Jungle_Planks_JE1_BE1.png|36px}} {{Animate|Mossy Stone Bricks JE1 BE1.png; Cracked_Stone_Bricks_JE1_BE1.png;Chiseled_Stone_Bricks_JE1_BE1.png|36px}} '''[[Log|Wood]], [[Leaves]], [[Planks]], and [[stone bricks|Stone Bricks Variants]]'''
* Now have their proper names (e.g. "Oak Wood", "Birch Leaves", "Spruce Wood Planks", "Mossy Stone Bricks").

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
[[File:Book and Quill JE1 BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Book and Quill|Book and Quills]]'''
* Game no longer pauses when writing in a book and quill.

[[File:Cocoa Beans JE1 BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Cocoa Beans]]'''
* Now obtainable from jungle tree leaves.

[[File:Oak Sign JE1 BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Sign]]s'''
* Game no longer pauses when writing in a sign.

'''Wooden [[Tool]]s'''
* Can now smelt one item in a furnace.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Farmer.png|36px]] '''[[Villager]]s'''
* When spawned from [[spawn egg]]s, they now get a random profession.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Breaking]]'''
* The 1⁄4 second (5 tick) delay between block breaking has been removed for players in [[Survival]]. The player can now [[Instant mining|instantly mine]] a large amount of blocks in Survival simply by holding {{control|destroy}} if conditions are met.

'''[[Hardcore]]'''
* Hardcore is now available in [[multiplayer]].

'''[[Singleplayer]]'''
* Separated server logic and client, therefore singleplayer is now a local server.

=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Game no longer pauses when entering a command or pausing the game.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Coordinates are now rounded to 5 digits.
* "ws", "fs" and "g" (Walking speed, flying speed and ground; "g" is ''true'' if the [[player]] is touching the ground).

'''[[Language]]'''
* Updated language files.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Splash "Mojang" screen now appears for 1 second instead of 3.

'''[[Texture pack]]s'''
* Support and auto-download for server texture packs.

'''[[Server jar]]'''
* The server jar now accepts [[Tutorial:Setting up a Java Edition server#Server_options|command-line arguments]] <code>--demo</code>, <code>--port</code>, <code>--singleplayer</code>, <code>--universe</code>, and <code>--world</code>. The old <code>nogui</code> argument still works for backward compatibility.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Infinite Map Visualizer]]'''
* Removed the infinite map visualizer from the game's source code.

'''Features broken by the internal server'''
{{main|Java Edition 12w18a/List of broken features}}
* Many features were broken or significantly changed due to the client-server split, many of which still remain absent from the game.

'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* The particles from adding an [[eye of ender]] to an [[end portal frame]] block no longer appear offset if performed at high distances from the world origin.
** This is due to the fact that they simply did not appear at all from this snapshot onward, which is {{bug|MC-10369|another bug entirely}}.
** This bug resurfaced in [[Java Edition 19w14a]] when the aforementioned absent particles bug was fixed.

'''Player'''
* The player "Notch" no longer drops an [[apple]] in addition to his inventory.

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed being unable to switch tools of the same kind in inventory.
* Fixed water destroying non-solid blocks when breaking them from above.
* Fixed picking a block in Creative with a tool in hand causing the tool to be lost.
* Fixed Silk Touch yielding only one slab from double slabs.

== Trivia ==
* In this version, when loading a singleplayer world, one needs to put <code>minecraft.zip/server/minecraft_server.jar</code> into <code>.minecraft/server</code> manually to continue loading.</onlyinclude>
