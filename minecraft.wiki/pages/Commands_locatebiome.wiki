{{Infobox command
|name=locatebiome
|oplevel=2
}}

Displays the [[coordinates]] for the closest [[biome]] of a given [[Biome/ID|biome ID]] or a biome tag in the [[chat]] for the player who executed the [[command]].

== Syntax ==
:<code>locatebiome <biome></code>

== Arguments ==
{{argument|biome|resource_or_tag}}
: Specifies the biome(s) to be located. See [[Biome/ID]] for a list of available biome IDs.
: {{arg desc|je=resource_or_tag}}

== Note ==
The horizonal search resolution is 32 [[blocks]], and vertical resolution is 64 blocks, which means biomes that are too narrow may not be found.

If successful, the following message is sent to chat: "''The nearest <biome name> is at [<x> ~ <z>] (<distance> blocks away)''"/"''The nearest <biome tag> (<biome name>) is at [<x> ~ <z>] (<distance> blocks away)''", in which <code><distance></code> is the horizontal distance between the executor and the biome. The coordinates can be clicked, which can put the command {{cmd|tp @s <x> ~ <z>}} in the chat box. The command can then be executed, and the player will be sent to those coordinates.

== Result ==
{{Result table|onlyje=1}}
{{Result table|the arguments are not specified correctly|unparseable}}
{{Result table|unable to locate the requested biome or biome tag within a square of 12801×12801 blocks area|fail}}
{{Result table|succeed|Displays the coordinates for the closest biome of the given type in the chat}}
{{Result table}}

== Output ==
{{Output table}}
{{Output table|edition=je|On fail|0|0|0}}
{{Output table|On success|1|1|horizontal distance between the executor and the biome}}
{{Output table}}

== Example ==
* To obtain the coordinates of the nearest desert: {{cmd|link=none|locatebiome desert}}
