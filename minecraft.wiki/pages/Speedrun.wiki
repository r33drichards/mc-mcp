A '''speedrun''' in {{MC}} is a play-through of the game performed with the intention of achieving a set goal as fast as possible. Speedruns may cover the whole game or a selected part, such as completing all [[achievement]]s, or killing a certain boss, usually the [[ender dragon]].<ref>{{Mcnet|how-speedrun-minecraft|How to speedrun Minecraft|July 20, 2019|[[Ash Parrish]]}}</ref>
