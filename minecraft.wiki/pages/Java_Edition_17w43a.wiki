'''17w43a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on October 25, 2017<ref>{{snap|17w43a|October 25, 2017}}</ref>, adding the first features of what was then called "Technically Updated". Although this is the first snapshot of 1.13, no Update Aquatic features were implemented yet because at the time the Update Aquatic was set to be released as 1.14 instead of 1.13, and as such snapshots from 17w43a to [[18w06a]] mainly add or modify commands.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Like [[resource pack]]s, but for [[loot table]]s, [[advancements]], [[Function (Java Edition)|function]]s, and [[structure]]s.
** Used by placing them into the <code>datapacks</code> folder of a world.
* Data packs are <code>.zip</code> files or folders with a <code>pack.mcmeta</code> in the root. See [[Tutorial:Creating a resource pack#Creating an MCMETA file|Tutorial:Creating a resource pack]] for more info.
* Structures will load from <code>(world)/generated/structures/(namespace)/(file).nbt</code> before checking data packs.
** However, this directory should ''not'' be used to distribute structures. Instead, move these files into data packs.
* Reloadable using {{cmd|reload}}.
* Structure: <code>pack.mcmeta</code>, <code>data</code> folder containing a namespace folder determining the namespace of its contents.
** A namespace should only contain the following symbols: {{code|01​​234​5​6​78​9abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-_}}.
** Inside the namespace folder, there can be folders for <code>functions</code>, <code>loot_tables</code>, <code>advancements</code> and  <code>structures</code>.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Fullscreen resolution
** Is used to change the resolution when in fullscreen.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* The name of keybindings now describes the actual key (e.g. 'LBUTTON' is changed to 'Left Button' and 'BACKSLASH' is changed to '\').

'''[[Missing texture]]'''
* Changed from {{pximg|Missing Texture JE3.png|64px}} to {{pximg|Missing Texture JE4.png|64px}}, shifting the positions of each constituent square.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Removed 3D Anaglyph completely.

'''Other'''
* Game library updates
** Upgraded to LWJGL 3.1.2
* Loading or creating a world shows the percentages of the loading stages.
** <code>Preparing spawn area</code> now shows as a loading stage.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* The default resource pack can now be moved up and down, just like other resource packs.
* Something has changed about loading resources - it appears as though all textures are preloaded in 1.12.2, but not necessarily from this snapshot onward.{{verify|Tested with an invalid sun texture. Does this affect all textures?}}
