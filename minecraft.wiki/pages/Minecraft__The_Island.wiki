== Synopsis ==
{{q|Washed up on a beach, the [[Guy|lone castaway]] looks around [[The Island (location)|the shore]]. ''Where am I?'' Who ''am I? And why is everything made out of blocks?'' But there isn’t much time to soak up the [[sun]]. It’s getting dark, and there is a strange new world to explore.

The top priority is finding food. The next is not ''becoming'' food. Because there are others out there on the island... like the horde of [[zombie]]s that appear after night falls. Crafting a way out of this mess is a challenge like no other. Who could build a home while running from exploding [[Creeper|creepers]], armed [[skeleton]]s, and an unstoppable tide of hot [[lava]]? Especially with no help except for a few makeshift tools and sage advice from an unlikely friend: a [[Moo|cow]].

In this world, the rules don’t always make sense, but courage and creativity go a long way. There are [[forest]]s to explore, [[Mineshaft|hidden underground tunnels]] to loot, and undead mobs to defeat. Only then will the secrets of the island be revealed.|Book description<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/minecraft-max-brooks/1124680387|title=Minecraft: The Island|website=Barnes & Noble}}</ref>}}
