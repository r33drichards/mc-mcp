This is a list of all of the features exclusive to the [[Legacy Console Edition]].

== General ==
[[File:Xbox 360 TU7-TU11 Tutorial mansion.png|right|thumb|275px|The Mansion in the TU7–TU11 Tutorial World on the Xbox 360.]]
; [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial|Tutorial]]
; DLC
* [[Mash-up pack]]s
** Has more [[music]] tracks.
* [[Texture pack]]s
** [[Texture pack DLC|Legacy Console Edition texture packs]]
** They were replaced by resource packs from ''[[Java Edition]]'' in [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]].
; [[Achievement]]s/[[Trophies]]
* More achievements/trophies.
; [[Bonus Chest]]
* Labeled as "Bonus Chest" instead of just "Chest" in the UI. [[Breaking]] and then placing the [[chest]] back down removes this unique label.
; [[Skin]]s
* 14 extra default skins.
* Certain Console Edition-exclusive [[skin pack]]s.
; [[Leaderboards]]
; [[Mini games|Mini Games]]
* Tumble mini-game
* Battle mini-game
* Glide mini-game
; [[Legacy Console Edition descriptions|Descriptions]]
* Gives the player detailed instructions about what an item/block/entity does.
; [[Sleeping]]
* New sleeping animation.
'''[[Music]]'''

* Background music plays all the time, rather than infrequently.

== World generation ==
; [[World size]]s
* Options for classic (864×864), small (1024×1024), medium (3072×3072), and large (5120×5120) world sizes. Large, medium, and small are only available on the ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]''. On the ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'', there are only classic, small, and medium world sizes.
** Water moat occupies the outer 2 chunks to smoothly transition to the edge of the world.
** Overwrite world edges option when expanding a world from a smaller size to a larger size, resetting the outer 2 chunks in the smaller world, removes the water moat at the edge of the world.
** Classic world size generates more villages than large world sizes.
; Biome Scale
* Small, medium, and large option. The small option is the default due to limited world size, so one world can have more biomes.
** Biome generation is roughly based on ''Java Edition'' 64 bit generation seeds. Large biome size is equivalent to biome size 4 from ''Java Edition'' [[Old Customized]] worlds, Medium is rough approximation on biome size 3, and small biome size roughly approximates to biome size 2. This is due to biome scaling taking place before hill biomes, edge biomes, and beach biome are applied to the map, unlike ''Java Edition'' Old Customized worlds where the scaling occurs after.
** Mushroom biomes generate in different locations compared to ''Java Edition''.
** Since the Exploration Update, temples and [[structure]]s attempt to spawn more frequently, due to limited world sizes, especially with [[woodland mansion]]s.
* There is a "Find Balanced Seed" option, selected by default, which makes the game randomly select seeds that have a better variety of biomes.
; [[The Nether]]
* Noise generation is loosely based on ''Java Edition'' nether noise generation.
* Has limited size, at 288×288, and is slightly larger with a larger world size. On Large worlds, the Nether is up to 640×640.
* The Nether-Overworld portal ratio is larger depending on world size: 1:3 in Classic and Small; 1:6 in Medium; and 1:8, like other versions of ''[[Minecraft]]'', in Large.
* Nether wart spawns randomly wherever [[soul sand]] is generated in the Nether.
* The edge of this dimension is made of bedrock.
* The Nether is hollow, with a flat ground, when using a [[superflat]] world.
; [[The End]]
* Up to one [[end gateway]] can generate on ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'', and ''[[Wii U Edition]]'', whereas up to four end gateways can generate on ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'', and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]''.
** The coordinates they generate are as follows, with the first set of coordinates being that of the first end gateway, and the remaining 3 gateways using the 3 remaining coordinates, but not in any particular order:
*** x:65 y:75 z:0
**** Leads to the southern island and is guaranteed to generate an [[end city]].
*** x:-65 y:75 z:0
**** Leads to the eastern island.
*** x:0 y:75 z:65
**** Leads to the northern island.
*** x:0 y:75 z:-65
**** Leads to the western island.
* Each end gateway portal leads to one [[Terrain features#Outer island|outer island]], which is as big as the [[Terrain features#Central island|main island]]. On the ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'', and ''[[Wii U Edition]]'', the only generated outer island always generates an end city with an [[End City#End ship|end ship]].
* The end gateways in the outer islands generate at a random position in a random corner and always 10 blocks above the ground just like in ''Java Edition''.
* The size does not change with regard to the world's [[world size]]. Even on the classic world size, the islands are so far apart that they are all on different [[map]]s.
** The spawn end island generates at 0,0, up to 96 blocks form the origin. Outer islands generate 2048 blocks from the origin in cardinal directions.
* Each island is surrounded by invisible walls, making it impossible to go between them without the use of end gateways.
** Only a 192 by 192 block area (12 by 12 chunks generate, 6 chunks from the center) for each island.
* Only the spawn end island's noise generation loosely follows ''[[Java Edition]]'' end noise generation. The outer end islands always generate the end island; rather than other end biomes (small end islands).
* The [[obsidian platform]] is located at X=60, Y=49, Z=60; unlike that of ''Java'' or [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']].
* [[End spike]]s are generated differently:
** Generates 8 pillars instead of 10.
** Centers of the pillars have a horizontal [[euclidean distance]] of 40 blocks to the exit portal.
** Are sorted by size with an ascending order clockwise.
** Start generating at Y-Level 1 instead of 0.
** The smallest pillar generates until Y-Level 73. Each next pillar going clockwise is 3 blocks taller.
** The 2 tallest pillars have [[iron bars]].
* The [[exit portal]] always generates at Y-Level 63.
* The exit portal always generates with a small island made out of [[end stone]] around it even with [[Seed (world generation)|world seed]]s that otherwise do not generate a central island.
; [[Superflat]] Interface
* An interface for creating superflat worlds. While a similar interface exists on older versions of ''[[Java Edition]]'', in Legacy Console Edition, it is much more versatile, allowing you to change what generates, how much it generates, and more.
* A maximum of 128 layers, including at least one layer of [[bedrock]] always at the bottom of the world that cannot be changed or removed.
** The Legacy Console Edition is the only edition of the game to have a block selection menu and biome selection menu for custom superflats, the layout of which are shown below:
*** There are a total of 250 unique different blocks in the custom superflat block selection menu as of [[PlayStation 4 Edition 1.95]]. Not all blocks can be used for custom superflat, such as [[slab]]s or [[stairs]].
*** There are a total of 21 different biomes in the biome selection menu for custom superflats. Not all [[biome]]s can be used, such as the [[birch forest]], which is notably missing from the custom superflat biome selection menu.

== Crafting ==
[[File:Crafting Table LCE.png|thumb|''[[Legacy Console Edition]]'''s crafting table interface]]
[[File:Crafting LCE.png|thumb|2x2 crafting interface]]
The game has a [[crafting]] system with the following categories. The categories of blocks and items in the crafting menu differ significantly from the Creative menu, and various blocks and items are grouped differently. [[Stonecutter]]s have a separate interface, although it functions very similar to the crafting menu.

The crafting system {{in|console}} could be changed to use the system from the Java Edition by checking the "Classic Crafting" option under "User Interface" in the options menu.

By default, Legacy Console Edition used a simplified crafting system. It did not require the [[player]] to place items in the correct place in the crafting interface, but instead displayed the ingredients required to craft the selected item and allows the player to craft that item as long as the player has the required crafting ingredients.

The [[PlayStation Vita Edition|''PlayStation Vita'']] and [[Wii U Edition|''Wii U'']] editions did not have the ability to craft using touch input.

=== Layout ===
{{Incomplete section|whether the following items are in, and where in the crafting menu they are located, as of PS4 version 1.95: (stripped wood; dyed wool; colored shulker boxes; cloned explorer map; written book). Which crafting and banner crafting patterns show in the inventory crafting menu; and which don't. Add missing items from the dyes tab. Double check the fireworks and dyes tab; if there are missing items, or an update changed the tabs or added more items. Are cut sandstone/cut red sandstone slabs cuttable like Java or not like Bedrock?}}

=== Notes ===
* [[Crafting]] entries with an asterisk (*) do not appear [[2×2 grid|outside]] the crafting table.
* The armor tab does not show in the inventory crafting menu, only in the [[crafting table]]. All other crafting tabs show even in the [[inventory ]]crafting menu. Only three of the six banner tabs show in the inventory banner crafting menu, including the select banner tab.
* As with the [[Creative inventory]], there is no search tab, unlike the [[recipe book]] on ''Java'' and ''Bedrock''. Players must instead browse each individual tab to find the item in question, or toggle to show craftable items only.
* When using the [[loom]] for banner crafting, only the banner crafting interface with the banner specific navigation tabs are available. In the first tab, only "Select Banner" is available.
* [[Furnace]]s, [[blast furnace]]s, and [[smoker]]s do not have a predefined menu selection of blocks, unlike the [[recipe book]] on other editions such as ''Java''.
* Colored materials are ordered by color data values, unlike colored items in the Creative inventory. This applies to all tabs (crafting, banners, dyes, fireworks), in both the crafting table and loom. The order of dyes in the crafting dyes in the decorations tab is different.

== Creative inventory ==
[[File:LCE Creative Inventory.png|thumb|right|baseline|Creative mode item selection screen in Legacy Console Edition]]
The [[Creative inventory]] in Legacy Console Edition was the same as ''Java Edition'', albeit with slightly different tabs and its own set of items.

On [[PlayStation 4 Edition 1.95]], there are a total of 1,043 unique items in the Creative inventory.

=== Differences ===
* There is no search tab, with all of the Creative inventory's items in a single tab, on Legacy Console. Players must instead browse each individual tab to find the item in question.
* Scrolling up and down in the Creative inventory and custom superflat scrolls one entire page at a time (five rows of items) on Legacy Console; instead of scrolling one row at a time like all other editions of the game.
* Both Luck effect and Decay effect potions and tipped arrows are available on Legacy Console.
* All [[Potion]] and [[Tipped Arrow]] types are arranged by base variants, followed by extended variants, and enhanced variants. They aren't arranged by regular, splash, and lingering potions like on ''Java'' or ''Bedrock''.
* Colored blocks and items are arranged in a different order from ''Java'' and ''Bedrock''. They don't use a rainbow order like all colored blocks and items on ''Java'' (almost all on ''Bedrock'').
* Banners on Legacy Console are arranged differently from all other colored blocks and items within.
* Enchanted books are ordered partially like that of ''Java'', and those added after the World of Color update, partially like that of ''Bedrock'', with other minor differences to the order of enchanted books.
* Unlike later versions of ''Java'' or ''Bedrock Edition'', spawn eggs are not sorted alphabetically, nor are they sorted with most passive mobs before most hostile ones. Instead; most hostile mob spawn eggs are listed before most passive mob spawn eggs.
* [[Slab]]s, [[stairs]], and [[wall]]s share the same order between Legacy Console and ''Bedrock Edition'' with the following exception: Stone brick and mossy stone brick stairs and slabs are found between mossy cobblestone and wooden variants on Legacy Console, rather than between wooden and sandstone variants like on ''Bedrock''.
