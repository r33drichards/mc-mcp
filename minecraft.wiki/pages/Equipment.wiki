{{for|the item category|Creative inventory#Bedrock Edition}}

'''Equipment''' refers to [[items]] that can be inserted into a specialized [[slot]] in a [[mob]]'s [[inventory]] in order to change certain aspects of its behavior and appearance. Equipment objects typically do not flash red when the mob takes [[damage]] and remain visible if the mob has the [[Invisibility]] effect.

== Specification ==
Custom equipment can be defined and referenced by the [[Data component format#equippable|equippable item component]].

Equipment definitions are stored in the <code>assets/<namespace>/equipment</code> directory of a resource pack.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}}: The root tag.
** {{nbt|compound|layers}}: Layer types for this equipment model. If a layer is omitted, the armor piece does not render when in the respective slot (with the exception of the head slot, where the regular item model is rendered instead).
*** {{nbt|list|Layer definitions}}: The layers for this layer type.
**** {{nbt|string|texture}}: A namespaced id pointing to a texture for this layer. <code>namespace:path</code> resolves to <code>assets/<namespace>/textures/entity/equipment/<layer_type>/<path>.png</code>.
**** {{nbt|compound|dyeable}}: (optional) Specifies how this layer behaves when the item is dyed. An item is considered as "dyed" when it has the [[Data_component_format#dyed_color|dyed_color data component]].
***** {{nbt|int|color_when_undyed}}: (optional) An rgb int in decimal representation. The color to tint this layer if the item is undyeable or not dyed. ''If this is not present and the item is not dyed, the layer is hidden.''
**** {{nbt|bool|use_player_texture}}: (optional, default: false) If set to true, the layer texture is overridden by a texture given by the player. ''This is currently used only for the <code>wings</code> layer type, where the player's cape texture is used instead if this is set to true.''
