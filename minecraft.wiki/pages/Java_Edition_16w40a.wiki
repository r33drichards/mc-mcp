'''16w40a''' is the tenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on October 6, 2016<ref name=blogpost_16w40a>https://www.mojang.com/2016/10/minecraft-snapshot-16w40a/</ref> to fix some bugs from [[16w39c]].

== Changes ==
'''[[Vindicator]]s'''
* "Johnny" vindicators are now also created by setting a new byte tag, <code>Johnny</code>, to true, in addition to renaming the vindicator to ''Johnny''. The tag supersedes the name, so a <code>Johnny</code> tag set to <code>1b</code> allows arbitrary names with the "Johnny" behavior, or a <code>Johnny</code> tag set to <code>0b</code> allows the name ''Johnny'' without the "Johnny" behavior.
* Their axe is now one of their <code>HandItems</code>, whereas before it was purely a visual effect. This means their attack now disables shields.
* Vindicators have been heavily buffed - their attack damage on Easy has been increased from {{hp|3}} to {{hp|7}}, on Normal {{hp|5}} to {{hp|13}}, and on Hard {{hp|7}} to {{hp|19}}.

'''Projectiles'''
* Tags <code>xTile</code>, <code>yTile</code>, <code>zTile</code>, <code>inTile</code> and <code>inGround</code> were removed.
* The <code>life</code> tag is no longer used for anything, but still saved/read.
* This affects [[ghast]] fireballs, [[blaze]] fireballs, [[fire charge]]s, [[dragon]] fireballs and [[Wither#Wither Skull|wither skull]]s.

'''[[End portal block]]s'''
* The starfield effect was changed to match that of the [[end gateway block]]. It no longer changes perspective with respect to the player, but now remains static with respect to the game screen.
