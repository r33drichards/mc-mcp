'''18w46a''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on November 15, 2018,<ref>{{snap|18w46a|November 15, 2018}}</ref> which adds [[lantern]]s and [[jigsaw block]]s.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Lantern JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Lantern]]s'''
* New [[light]] source.
* Crafted with 8 [[iron nugget]]s surrounding 1 [[torch]].
* Can be placed either hanging under or on top of a block.
* Gives slightly more light than a torch.
* Emits light level of 15

'''[[File:Jigsaw Block JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Jigsaw block]]s'''
* A technical block.
* Not obtainable in [[Survival]].
* Is a junction block that allows to construct structures out of smaller templates. 
** ''Target pool'' refers to a pool of elements the jigsaw block can draw elements from (ie: the next template to place). 
** ''Attachment type'' refers to the "name" of the jigsaw block. Jigsaw blocks can only connect to other jigsaw blocks with the same "name" (attachment type). 
** ''Turn into'' is the block state the jigsaw block will turn into once the whole feature is placed. <!-- — [[ProfMobius]] From a private discussion, so it would probably be better to remove it once we know enough and it is no longer necessary. Same info also exists on https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft & Reddit -->

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cartography table]]s, [[fletching table]]s, and [[smithing table]]s'''
* Updated block texture.

'''[[Scaffolding]]'''
* Can now be placed 6 blocks out from its base of support without falling.

'''[[Stonecutter]]s'''
* Updated block texture.
* Animated saw.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Pillager]]s'''
* Improved AI.
* No longer drop [[emerald]]s.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Illager patrol]]s'''
* Now spawn in the world as a pack of 5 random [[illager]]s.
* Removed the [[illager beast]] from patrols.

=== General ===
'''Technical'''
* Added support for directional opacity of [[block]]s.
** Used by [[carpet]], [[enchanting table]], [[end portal frame]], [[farmland]], [[grass path]]s, extended [[piston]] base blocks, [[slab]]s, [[snow layer]]s, and [[stairs]]: their full-block faces block light, and their non-full faces let light through the gaps.
** Not used by [[cauldron]]s, [[comparator]]s, [[daylight detector]]s, [[hopper]]s, [[redstone repeater]]s, or [[stonecutter]]s: these are fully transparent, and let light through all their faces, even their full-block faces.
* Added loot table for [[illusioner]]s.
