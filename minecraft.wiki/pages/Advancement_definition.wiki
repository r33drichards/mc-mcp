Custom [[advancement]]s in [[data pack]]s of a ''Minecraft'' world store the advancement data for that world as separate JSON files.
{{TOC|none|limit=2}}

== File format ==
All advancement JSON files are structured according to the following format.

=== Legend ===
* <span style="color:red;">*</span>: If parent field is written, this field is required.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag.
** {{nbt|string|parent}}: The parent advancement directory of this advancement. If absent, this advancement is a root advancement. Circular references cause a loading failure.
** {{nbt|compound|display}}: Data related to the advancement's display.
*** {{nbt|compound|icon}}<span style="color:red;">*</span>: Object containing data for the advancement's icon.
**** {{nbt|string|id}}<span style="color:red;">*</span>: An [[Java Edition data values#Items|item ID]].
**** {{nbt|int|count}}: Optional. The amount of the item. Falls back to 1 if the field is absent.
**** {{nbt|compound|components}}: Optional. Additional information about the item. See [[Item format/1.20.5|item components]].
*** {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound}}{{nbt|list|title}}<span style="color:red;">*</span>: A [[Raw JSON text format|JSON text component]] for the title of this advancement.
*** {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound}}{{nbt|list|description}}<span style="color:red;">*</span>: A [[Raw JSON text format|JSON text component]] for the description text of this advancement.
*** {{nbt|string|frame}}: Type of frame for the icon. {{code|challenge}} for [[File:Advancement-fancy-raw.png|25px|alt=fancy frame]], {{code|goal}} for [[File:Advancement-oval-raw.png|25px|alt=oval frame]], {{code|task}} for [[File:Advancement-plain-raw.png|25px|alt=plain frame]]. Defaults to {{cd|task}}.
*** {{nbt|string|background}}: The directory for the background to use in this advancement tab (used only for the root advancement).
*** {{nbt|boolean|show_toast}}: Whether to show a toast to the player when this advancement has been completed. Defaults to {{cd|true}}.
*** {{nbt|boolean|announce_to_chat}}: Whether to announce in the chat when this advancement has been completed. Defaults to {{cd|true}}.
*** {{nbt|boolean|hidden}}: Whether to hide this advancement and all its children from the advancement screen until this advancement have been completed. Has no effect on root advancements themselves, but still affects all their children. Defaults to {{cd|false}}.
** {{nbt|compound|criteria}}<span style="color:red;">*</span>: The criteria to be tracked by this advancement.
*** {{nbt|compound|<criterionName>}}: The key is a unique name given to the criterion. Can be any valid text.
**** See [[#Criteria|below]] for details.
** {{nbt|list|requirements}}: Defines how these criteria above are completed to grant the advancement. Contains sublists, which in turn contain names of criteria from this advancement (all the {{cd|<criterionName>}}s). When a criterion is newly completed or revoked, the advancement is granted if all sublists have at least one criterion within them completed. Optional, defaults to requiring all criteria completed.
*** {{nbt|list}} Sublist within {{nbt|list|requirements}}, contains strings of {{cd|<criterionName>}}s. If a sublist is empty, the advancement is unachievable without cheats.
**** {{nbt|string}} A criterion name.

</div>

== Display ==
Within the root tag of an advancement JSON object, the {{nbt|compound|display}} object and the {{nbt|string|parent}} string, both optional, are related to the display of the advancement.

If the {{nbt|compound|display}} tag is present, it must have the {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound|title}}, {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound|description}} and {{nbt|compound|icon}} fields present in order to be considered as valid advancement display data.

The {{nbt|string|parent}} field, albeit not directly associated with the display data of an advancement, affects only the display data effectively. When an advancement does not have a display data and none of its children has a display data, the parent of the advancement affects only {{cmd|advancement ... through{{!}}from{{!}}until}} usage.

=== Advancement tabs ===
Creating a root advancement (no {{nbt|string|parent}}) with valid {{nbt|compound|display}} data automatically creates a tab in the [[Advancements#Interface|advancement menu]]. When loaded, the root advancement shows as a tab in the menu when any advancement in its advancement tree is granted to the player viewing the menu.

The [[missing texture]] displays on the tab's background if the root advancement does not have a background.

If a root advancement successfully creates a tab, child advancements of the root appear inside of that tab, provided they also have valid {{nbt|compound|display}} data.

=== Positioning ===
The game automatically arranges advancements, positions them when it loads advancements from data packs, and sends the arrangement to the client. Each advancement has an arrow from its closest visible ancestor (i.e. if its parent does not have a display, it has a link from its grandparent, and so on). The root advancement appears on the leftmost column while each arrow points to an advancement in the next column. The arrangement of advancements within a column is chosen at random upon the player joining the world or server.

=== Lack of display ===
Some advancements, such as the vanilla recipe unlocking advancements, may lack a display so that they can utilize [[#List of triggers|triggers]] and rewards instead of excessive [[commands]] or [[Function (Java Edition)|functions]] for more functionalities and a more flexible control. These advancements should not have the {{nbt|compound|display}} field defined in order to hide from users and enjoy a better loading performance.

==Criteria==
* <span style="color:red;">*</span>: If parent field is written, this field is required.

The format of a criterion:
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|<criterionName>}}: Root object. The key can be any valid text.
** {{nbt|string|trigger}}<span style="color:red;">*</span>: The [[#List of triggers|trigger]] for this criterion.
** {{nbt|compound|conditions}}: Object containing conditions that need to be met when the trigger gets activated. The criterion is marked completed when the trigger activates and all conditions passed.
*** {{nbt|compound|player}}: Checks properties of the player that would get the advancement. Not available for <code>minecraft:impossible</code> trigger.
****{{nbt inherit/conditions/entity}}
*** {{nbt|list|player}}: Another format for "player". Specifies a list of [[predicate]]s that must pass in order for the criterion to be granted. Not available for <code>minecraft:impossible</code> trigger.
**** {{nbt|compound}}: A single [[predicate]].
*** Extra contents depend on selected {{nbt|string|trigger}}.
</div>

== List of triggers ==
All JSON fields in the conditions are <u>optional</u> unless marked with "<span style="color:red;">*</span>".
