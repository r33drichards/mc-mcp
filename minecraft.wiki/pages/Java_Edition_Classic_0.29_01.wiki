== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Hitbox]]'''
* At times, you can build/destroy through other [[entities]], including players.

'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* Players' names only appear when pointing at them with the [[crosshair]].
* Names are no longer hidden through terrain.

== Trivia ==
* 0.29_01 can be changed to Survival mode by editing the <code>Minecraft.class</code> file in <samp>[[minecraft.jar]]</samp>.
* This version was originally rediscovered in a modified state in March 23, 2019.  
** An unmodified copy was later found by Twitter user [https://web.archive.org/web/20210627003058/https://twitter.com/lunasorcery/status/1408785025492000770 lunasorcery] on June 25, 2021.
* In the blog post for this version, Notch states "You can now build through players". However, this feature does not work like intended.{{More info needed|What exactly?}}
