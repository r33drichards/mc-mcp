== Usage ==
[[File:Darkglowstone.png|right|thumb|The light from a glowstone block is completely blocked by tinted glass.]]

Tinted glass behaves like an opaque block, blocking [[light]] and [[beacon]] beams completely, despite being visually transparent. However, it isn't a solid block, and as with regular glass, mobs do not suffocate inside it. Unlike other types of glass, it cannot be turned into [[glass pane]]s. Mobs do not spawn on top, similar to regular glass.

=== Note blocks ===
Tinted glass can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "hat" sound.
