* [[Mentioned features]], which have been mentioned by ''[[Minecraft]]'''s developers but their implementation has not been confirmed yet.
* [[Removed features]], which were once in the game but since have been removed.
* [[:Category:Scrapped features|Scrapped features]], which were officially considered but never implemented in a build.
* [[:Category:Shelved features|Shelved features]], where were originally going to be part of a released update but were removed to be possibly added in a later update.
