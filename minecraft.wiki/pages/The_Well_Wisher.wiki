'''The Well Wisher''' is a vengeful cursed<ref name=curse>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161007092404/http://mojang.com/2016/10/eek-the-campfire-tales-skin-pack-creeps-onto-pocket-win-10-today/ EEK! CAMPFIRE TALES SKIN PACK HAUNTS POCKET / WIN 10!], written by Marsh Davies, October 5, 2016</ref> [[ghost|spirit]] who dwells within a [[well]] on [[Eerie Island]] in the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]''. She was the main antagonist of ''[[The Well Wisher (episode)|The Well Wisher]]'', the third episode of the first season. She also appeared as a skin in the [[Campfire Tales]] [[skin pack]].

== Appearance ==
The Well Wisher looks like an ''[[Wikipedia:Onryo|Onryo]]'' from Japanese myths and pop culture. She has pale green skin and long hair. She has no face, and on her head is a miniature statue of a well, and she is dressed in a long, white, torn robe.

== Power and Abilities == 
As shown in the series, she can levitate and does not need air to breathe underwater.

== Biography ==
The origin of The Well Wisher is unknown, but according to a campfire tale, she was once an ordinary [[human]] who was told to drop a penny into a well and then to make a wish; but upon leaning too far over, she fell into the well herself, either slipping or being pushed in. From then on, she sought appeasement from every life she claimed.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|782701948222832640|Time for another Campfire Tale! *eerie rattling sound* Wait, what was that?! Ah, probably nothing. Right?|October 2, 2016}}</ref>

Sometime after the creation of the legend, a reality game show hosts an episode on Eerie Island. After an incident involving [[Farm Monsters|hostile animals]], the two teams go down an old well which the host claims according to legend is inhabited by The Well Wisher. While the teams attempt to fit four different types of items into item frames without repeating any items to win a jukebox, The Well Wisher makes her presence known, revealing the legend to be true. While attempting to avoid being killed by The Well Wisher, Team Stone Beach wins the challenge and are rewarded a jukebox with music discs. At the end, as the host is concluding the episode, his boat is almost attacked unawares by The Well Wisher.

==Trivia==
Her backstory and appearance are strongly reminiscent of {{w|Sadako Yamamura}} from ''The Ring'' franchise. Both are vengeful, evil, murderous spirits of women in white dresses with long black hair and pale skin who died by falling or being pushed into a well.
