'''Minecraft Live is Coming Soon!''' is a trailer announcing [[Minecraft Live 2024]].

== Summary ==
A [[frog]] tries to eat a blue [[parrot]], when as it dodges the tongue, suddenly the ''[[Minecraft Live]]'' logo appears. The blue parrot perches down next to a gray parrot, as the two begin bobbing their heads to the sound of music. A [[chicken]] teleports into the area, followed by an [[enderman]], a [[panda]], and a [[goat]]. An [[armadillo]] begins dancing along, and then a leucistic [[axolotl]]. The previously established goat and chicken join in, followed by a persian [[cat]] above the axolotl. Several animals are shown in succession, including a white [[sheep]], the panda, a red [[fox]].

Several more animals continue to spawn into the room, beginning with a [[turtle]], followed by a [[cow]]. Suddenly, the mobs begin to vanish in a hurry, leaving behind a [[bee]], a salt & pepper [[rabbit]], and the persian cat. The date for the event appears, which the rabbit looks up at, before the bee appears to read over it and leave. The cat falls asleep, concluding the video.
