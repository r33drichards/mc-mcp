A '''glass pane''' is a transparent [[block]] that can be used as a more efficient alternative to [[glass]] blocks. It can be dyed into [[stained glass pane]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Glass panes can be obtained using a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. If one is broken without a Silk Touch enchantment, it drops nothing.

Glass panes do not have an assigned tool; they are mined at the same speed regardless of what tool is used.<ref>{{bug|MC-179316||Glass blocks do not have an assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Glass Pane|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Glass panes generate naturally as windows in [[village]]s, [[woodland mansion]]s, and [[ancient cities]].

=== Crafting ===

|Output= Glass Pane,16
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
Glass panes are more efficient to use than glass blocks, as six glass blocks can be crafted into sixteen glass panes, yielding 2{{frac|2|3}} panes per block. Windows built using glass panes can be up to 267% (2{{fraction|2|3}} times) larger in area than windows built with regular glass blocks.
[[File:Glass with spider-shaped hole.png|thumb|150px|A single space between two glass panes results in a 2×1 hole, which [[spider]]s can pass through.]]

=== Placement ===
If placed without anything on the sides, they appear as a thin vertical • shape, 2×2 pixels in size; but when other blocks occupy adjacent spaces, it becomes flat or turns into a [[File:Curve.png|text-top]] or [[File:T junction.png|text-top]] or [[File:Cross.png|text-top]] shape depending on the items surrounding it. The collision box is identical to the shape of the pane. Therefore, two glass panes placed with one empty space in between form a gap that is two blocks wide.

Glass panes are never oriented horizontally. Horizontal glass surfaces must be made from glass blocks.

Glass panes can be [[waterlogged]], which means water can be in the same place as a glass pane, unlike regular glass.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Locking maps ===
Glass panes can be used in [[cartography table]]s to lock [[map]]s, which makes them unable to be filled again or altered when exploring.
