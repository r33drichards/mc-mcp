The '''funky portal''' is a joke [[block]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]] that allows entry into randomly generated [[Java_Edition_20w14∞#Dimensions|dimensions]]. It is a colored variant of the [[Nether portal block]] with the color being determined by the destination dimension.

== Obtaining ==
The funky portal block cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. The funky portal block can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}} and is generated when throwing a [[written book]] into a [[Nether portal]]. After throwing the book into the portal, the book is destroyed. It does not go through the portal after having changed it. The generated portal has a random destination, unless the text leads to an Easter Egg dimension. Rarely, when throwing the book into the portal, the Nether portal turns into multiple funky portal colors. Each book generates its own dimension, and books with the same page content generate the same dimension. Using {{cmd|setblock ~ ~ ~ neither_portal}}{{Info needed|Is this a sic?}} sets the block and give it randomized block data as to its destination dimension. The color of a funky portal is determined by its destination dimension. The color of any portal can be found by converting its dimension ID into hexadecimal. The last six digits of that number is the RGB color.

=== Breaking ===
Funky portal blocks cannot be broken by tools except in creative mode, but can be destroyed by breaking the portal frame, by explosions, or by placing a liquid inside the portal.

== Usage ==
Running {{cmd|/data get block}} on funky portal blocks returns the data that includes the name of the dimension.
