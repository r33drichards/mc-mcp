A '''trapped chest''' is a type of [[chest]] that functions almost identically, but has a red-tinted latch and produces [[redstone]] power while open.

Like normal chests, two trapped chests can merge into a '''large trapped chest''' if placed next to each other.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Trapped chests can be broken with any [[tool]], but [[axe]]s are the fastest. Items contained in the chest are dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large trapped chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed trapped chest are dropped and the remaining trapped chest continues to function as a small trapped chest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Trapped Chest|Axe|foot=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Trapped chests naturally generate in "fake end portal rooms" in [[woodland mansion]]s. They always contain two [[ender pearl]]s and activate the two nearby [[TNT]] blocks when opened.

== Usage ==
Trapped chests can be used as containers and as [[redstone component]]s.

To place a trapped chest, {{control|place}} the face of a block adjacent to the space the trapped chest should occupy.

Placing two adjacent trapped chests side-by-side typically joins them to create a large trapped chest. To avoid them joining and instead place two single trapped chests side by side, a player may {{control|sneak}} while placing the second trapped chest{{only|java}}, or place the second trapped chest facing a different direction from the first one. Alternately, normal [[chest]]s do not combine with trapped chests.

Trapped chests can be moved by pistons.{{only|bedrock}} [[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to trapped chests as if they were flammable, but the chests do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either).

Trapped chests can also activate buried [[TNT]], destroying themselves, their contents and any [[mob]]s or players near them. They need to be opened twice for the TNT to be activated.

=== Container ===
[[File:Chest GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|The GUI of a trapped chest.]]
[[File:Large Chest GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|The GUI of a large trapped chest.]]

A single trapped chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large trapped chest has 54 slots of inventory space. In a large trapped chest, the top three rows in the interface correspond to the western or northern chest block and the bottom three to the southern or eastern chest block.

To open the trapped chest GUI, use the {{control|Use Item}} control. To move items between the trapped chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the trapped chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the trapped chest GUI, use the {{key|Esc}} control.

By default, the GUI of a trapped chest is labeled "Chest" and the GUI of a large trapped chest is labeled "Large Chest." A trapped chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the trapped chest in an [[anvil]] before placing it, or by using the {{cmd|data}} command{{only|java}} (for example, to label a trapped chest at (0,64,0) "Loot!", use <code>/data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'"Loot!"'}</code>). If half of a large trapped chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large trapped chest, but if the named half is destroyed, the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large trapped chest have different names, the GUI label takes the name of the northernmost or westernmost half of the large trapped chest depending on its orientation (the half with the lowest coordinate in the appropriate axis).

A trapped chest can be "locked" by setting the trapped chest's <code>lock</code> tag. If a trapped chest's <code>lock</code> tag is not blank, the trapped chest cannot be opened except by players holding an item with the same name as the <code>lock</code> tag's text. A trapped chest's <code>lock</code> tag can be set or unset with the [[Commands/data|data]] command. For example, to lock a trapped chest at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named "Alice's Key" can open the trapped chest, use <code>data merge block 0 64 0 {lock:{components:{"custom_name":"Alice's Key"}}}</code>.

=== Redstone component ===
[[File:Chest-Comparsion.png|thumb|Chests (''left'') and trapped chests (''right'') can be placed next to each other. [[Redstone dust]] configures itself to point toward trapped chests, but not toward regular chests.]]
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

Trapped chests can be used to detect when they have been opened by players or [[copper golem]]s.

A trapped chest is inactive while not being accessed, but activates when accessed by a player or copper golem. Accessing either part of a large trapped chest activates both halves of the large trapped chest. Other [[mob]]s cannot access/activate trapped chests, and trapped chest is not activated by items moving into or out of it by [[dropper]]s or [[hopper]]s.

While active, a trapped chest:
* powers any adjacent [[redstone dust]], including beneath the trapped chest, to a [[Redstone circuit#Power|power level]] equal to the number of players or copper golems accessing the trapped chest at once (maximum 15)
* powers any adjacent [[redstone repeater]]s facing away from the trapped chest to power level 15
* strongly powers any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, block of gold, etc.) beneath the trapped chest to a power level equal to the number of players or copper golems accessing the trapped chest (maximum 15)
* activates any adjacent [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]], including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc. Due to hoppers being locked by redstone activation, hoppers below a trapped chest do not take items from it while it is open.

An active trapped chest does ''not'' power any adjacent [[redstone comparator]]s facing away from it. Redstone comparators can [[Redstone comparator#Measure block state|measure]] the block state of the trapped chest, producing a power level from 0 to 15 proportional to how full the trapped chest is. Anything else powered by an active trapped chest (including a block beneath it) can power redstone comparators normally.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s become hostile toward players who open, break or interact with trapped chests.

=== Fuel ===
Trapped chests can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per chest.

=== Note blocks ===
Trapped chests can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sound.

== Christmas chest ==
{{anchor|Xmas chest}}
{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
<!--is this entire section neccessary?-->
As with normal chests, on December 24, 25, and 26, trapped chests and large trapped chests have their textures changed to Christmas chests that look like presents. This makes normal and trapped chests impossible to identify unless a player places [[redstone dust]] or uses the [[debug screen]].
