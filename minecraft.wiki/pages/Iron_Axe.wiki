An '''iron axe''' is a variant of [[axe]] and can be crafted from [[iron ingot]]s. It can be used to cut down trees faster, to [[Axe#Stripping and scraping|strip]] [[log]]s and [[scrape]] [[Copper#Blocks|copper-based blocks]], and as a melee weapon that disables [[shields]]. It is the third-highest [[tier]] of axe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack speed, durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[copper axe]].

==== Equipment ====
{{Main|Drops#Equipped items}}

A [[vindicator]] spawns with an iron axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. It is usually heavily damaged and is sometimes enchanted.

==== Raids ====
{{IN|be}}, [[vindicator]]s and [[pillager]]s that spawn in raids have a 4.1% chance (5.12% on hard) to drop a badly-damaged iron axe, which is sometimes enchanted with a random enchantment. A vindicator can drop 2 iron axes, one from natural equipment and one from raid drops.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

=== Villager gifts ===
[[Weaponsmith]] [[villager]]s occasionally throw iron axes at players with the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect.{{only|java}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
Iron axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.{{note|Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.}}
<references group="note"/>

=== Stripping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} an iron axe on a [[log]], [[wood]] block, or [[block of bamboo]] turns it into a [[stripped log]], [[stripped wood]], or [[block of stripped bamboo]], respectively. This uses 1 point of the axe's durability.

=== Scraping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} an iron axe on a waxed or oxidized [[copper]] block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise removes a level of oxidization. This uses 1 point of durability.

=== Weapon ===
When used as a weapon, an iron axe loses 2 durability points.

==== {{JE}} ====
Attacking a [[shield]] user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. [[Vindicator]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, or other [[mob]]s with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a [[sword]] of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]], resulting in lower <abbr title="Damage/Second">DPS</abbr>.

! Lifetime damage inflicted<ref group="note">The formula to find the total lifetime damage is <code>ceil(''durability'' &divide; 2) &times; ''damage per hit''</code>. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.</ref>

==== Unit repair ====

{{Repairing

| Damaged Iron Axe; Iron Ingot

}}

An iron axe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]], with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
An iron axe can receive the following enchantments:
