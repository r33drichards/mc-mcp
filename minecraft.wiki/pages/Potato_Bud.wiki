A '''potato bud''' is a joke [[block]] added in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Potato buds drop as an item when mined with any tool or by hand, but mining it with a sword is the fastest.
{{breaking row|Potato Bud|sword=1|horizontal=1}} <!-- Not sure if this produces the correct time, the block is kinda weird -->

=== Natural generation ===
Potato buds naturally generate in the [[corruption]] biome in [[Potato dimension]].

== Usage ==
The block acts similarly to [[pointed dripstone]]: it grows upward like a stalactite, and if entities land on the tip, they take bonus fall damage. Potato buds can't be placed on the ceiling and they grow much faster than pointed dripstone, up to the maximum height of 25 blocks.

This block is also able to be used in a composter.
