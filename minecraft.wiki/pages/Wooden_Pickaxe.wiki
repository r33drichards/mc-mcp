A '''wooden pickaxe''' is an early-game variant of [[pickaxe]] that is crafted from [[planks]]. It is the seventh-highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having the lowest [[mining efficiency]], and having the lowest attack damage alongside [[golden pickaxe]]s. It has a [[mining level]] of 0, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[stone]] and [[coal ore]]. It can be used as [[fuel]] in a [[furnace]], [[smoker]], or [[blast furnace]].

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
A wooden pickaxe is used to break stone-based and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a wooden pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s.

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to [[recover]]. Wooden pickaxes do {{hp|2}} damage per attack, or 2.4 damage per second.

==== {{BE}} ====
All pickaxes attack instantly, with wooden pickaxes doing {{hp|3}} damage per attack.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

}}

A wooden pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding wooden [[planks]], with each plank restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two wooden pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A wooden pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
