{{Quote|Floating villagers, tumbling pandas, and flying squids! It may sound like the ultimate Minecraft-themed Halloween party, but these are just a few of the bugs we’ve tackled in the game! Join @Gnembon, Jens Bergensten, and Jay Wells as they talk about their favorite bugs, why they happen, and how they were fixed – or even replaced with handy features. Have you tracked down a bug? Submit it to bugs.mojang.com and we’ll try to squash it – err, I mean gently scoop it up and carry it outside.|Why Is That Squid Flying? description|image=YouTube logo.svg}}
