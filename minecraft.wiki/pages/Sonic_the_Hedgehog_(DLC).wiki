== Summary ==
=== Tails' Lab ===
The map begins inside of a garage, with the player facing a [[NPC]], teaching the player to build momentum by {{control|sprinting}}. Beside that is [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Omochao Omochao], who gives advice on [[performance]] issues, links to the bug tracker, and offers the options to help with time-based achievements and clear the Lab of decorations. Behind the sign is a large generator, surrounded by scraps, nuts, bolts, crates, toolboxes, and cardboard boxes, and behind Omochao is a TV screen with credits for the map. Circling the room are a mini obstacle course, lined with game elements and additional tutorials.

At the very start is a tutorial on collecting rings, followed by an explanation on how rings are lost. Proceeding from there are small pits lined with spikes, above them [[painting|notices]] for Gamemode One's social media, including their support again. Jumping over the spikes will lead to a spring, which can elevate the player to a tutorial on {{control|jumping}} on enemies beside [[beacons]]. Below is a live [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Moto_Bug Moto-bug], patrolling back and forth for the player to test fighting enemies, at the end a TV containing several rings. Passing by several rings will lead to a final screen, teaching the player to spin dash, with a breakable wall nearby to test it on.

Breaking through the wall reveals the rest of the Lab, introduced shrouded in darkness with flickering lights. Dropping down will activate the Warp Rings, which lead to the levels and begin lightening the room. Throughout the rest of the room are similar triggers, marked by a light ring, which will progressively reveal the utilities of the area. In the center of the room is a container of the Chaos Emeralds, which is filled up as progress is made finding them. In front of Green Hill is the [[achievement]] board, tracking 16 different achievements, and behind that is the [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Tornado_2 Tornado 2] be, beside a [[lectern]] listing patch notes. Right of the Tornado 2 is a spring up to a second layer of the Lab, approaching it opening a door into an area dedicated to Labyrinth Zone. Behind the spring is a storage area filled with props, with a light trigger bringing attention to a painting of a [https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Neutral_Garden Chao Garden].

On the second floor of the Lab, a light trigger will be activated, identifying the spot as the "Comfort Zone." In this area, the player can select to play as any of the playable characters. Behind the first trigger is another, referring to a jukebox that allows the player to change the song in the Lab. From here the player has activated all the lights, and can freely play the game. Also in the Comfort Zone is Tails' Computer.
