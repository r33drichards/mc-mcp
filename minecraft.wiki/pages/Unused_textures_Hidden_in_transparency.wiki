[[File:Alpha Viewing Tutorial.png|thumb|Method of viewing 0 opacity pixels being used to view the zombie villager head present in the zombie texture file.]]
Some textures include colored pixels set to 0 opacity, making their color information present and retrievable by disabling the alpha channel.<ref group="note">This can be done in GIMP for example, by going to "Colors > Levels", changing the channel to "Alpha", and then moving the black arrow under "Output Levels" to the right.</ref> These colored pixels often reveal scrapped ideas for textures and models. This page reveals hidden colored pixels on textures that include them.

=== Atlas ===
There are many hidden pixels in the texture atlas. The first one is that some Items has the old and new textures of items:

-A lot items are mixed with Pre-1.3 and 1.3 textures, which the 1.3 textures made a lot items centered properly. Another one is from the heads, which were changed in 12w36a to center it.

-Some are from snapshots/dev versions.<gallery>

=== Ocelot and cat ===
The ocelot and the cat variants were added in [[Java Edition 1.2.1|1.2.1]]. The ocelot's hidden pixels contain an extra head texture, and all the cat textures feature an orange texture with black lines across it. After [[Java Edition 1.14|1.14]], the ocelot texture no longer contains hidden pixels. Most of the new cat textures are edited from the old ones, as indicated by the similar hidden patterns. The textures also appear to have been cropped, since a large part of the old hidden texture is missing, with the exception of the red cat texture, which appears to be unchanged.<gallery widths="64" heights="64">

=== Wolf ===
The wolf was added in [[Java Edition Beta 1.4]]. All four wolf texture files feature similar hidden textures base on the [[cow]], which suggests that the cow was used as a template for wolf textures. The most extreme is the collar texture, which originally contains only the collar, but there is an entire wolf and other unused textures hidden in transparency.<gallery widths="64" heights="64">
