{{Quote|As I sit here in my warm study, surrounded by my treasured books, my mind turns to the worlds beyond my windows. Out there, countless adventurers are courageously exploring the Overworld and beyond... ...The time has come for me to retire from my role as explorer, and so I leave you with my life's work — a thorough account of every mob discovered so far in this strange and perilous world.|The Naturalist speaking in the preface from the ''Minecraft: Mobestiary''.}}

== Trivia ==

* According to Alex Wiltshire, the Naturalist is somewhat conjectured.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://imgur.com/eQVpq8u|title=Direct message|author=Alex Wiltshire|website=Imgur|date=July 22, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815090609/https://imgur.com/eQVpq8u|archive=|quote=Hello! If you read the Mobestiary carefully, you'll notice that it's written from the point of view of one particular naturalist who tends to put their own theories and ideas among the facts, and maybe doesn't even have personal experience of the creatures they're writing about. So you should decide for yourself if you agree with them :)}}</ref>
