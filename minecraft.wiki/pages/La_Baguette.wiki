'''La baguette''' is a joke [[weapon]] from [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]] resembling the [[Wikipedia:Baguette|iconic French bread of the same name]]. Its stats are identical to a [[wooden sword]], though la baguette cannot be used to fuel furnaces.

== Obtaining ==
One [[tricolore]] and one baguette is given to all players when [[French mode]] gets activated.

== Usage ==
La baguette functions identically to a wooden sword. Despite appearances it is not a [[food]] item and is unrelated to regular [[bread]].

=== Attacking ===
It can be used to damage mobs for {{hp|4}} health points. La baguette has an attack speed of 1.6 and takes 0.6 seconds to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]].

=== Breaking ===
La baguette, just like other swords, can be used to break certain blocks 50% faster. See [[Sword#Sword breaking times]] for more.

=== Repairing ===
==== Grinding ====

|description=The durability of the two baguettes is added together, plus extra 3 points of durability. Any enchantments, besides curses, would be removed.
}}

==== Unit repair ====
Strangely, la baguette can be repaired using planks rather than [[bread]], just like a wooden sword.
