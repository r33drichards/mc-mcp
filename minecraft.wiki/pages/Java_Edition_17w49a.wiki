'''17w49a''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on December 6, 2017<ref>{{snap|17w49a|December 6, 2017}}</ref>, which added block and item tags.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Items and blocks can now be "tagged" with an ID.
** Block tags can be used when testing for blocks in the world.
** Items tags can be used when testing for items in inventories.
* Tags are created using [[data pack]]s in <code>data/(namespace)/tags/blocks</code> or <code>data/(namespace)/tags/items</code>.
** For example: <code>data/(namespace)/tags/blocks/foo.json</code>.
** This creates a block tag called <code>(namespace):foo</code>.
** The json file contains a list of all blocks that should be "tagged".
* There are two default tags for both the item form and the block form: <code>minecraft:wool</code> for all wool blocks and <code>minecraft:planks</code> for all wood plank blocks.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''Crafting'''
* Recipes can now refer to a tag instead of an item.
