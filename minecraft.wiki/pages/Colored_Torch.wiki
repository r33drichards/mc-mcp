'''Colored torches''' are [[torch]]es colored by [[Compound#Chlorides|metal chloride]]s, available in blue, red, purple, and green.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Colored torches break instantly and drop itself when broken using anything. The [[tool]] does not take any [[durability]] damage.

Colored torches are also broken if pushed by a [[piston]].

=== Crafting ===

}}

== Usage ==
Torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some require {{control|sneaking}} (see [[#Placement|placement]] for exceptions). Being non-solid, torches have no collision box.

Gravity-affected blocks like [[sand]] and [[gravel]] do not fall if the block below them has a torch on it and break when falling onto a torch.

=== Light ===
Torches emit a [[light]] level of 14. Torches also melt [[snow layer]]s within 2 blocks and [[ice]] within 3 blocks ([[taxicab distance]]). Colored torches emit normal light, not colored light, and therefore the coloring is purely aesthetic.

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the top part of colored torches emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#0000ff}} for blue torches, {{Color|#ff00ff}} for purple torches, {{Color|#ff0000}} for red torches, and {{Color|#00ff00}} for green torches. This causes the bottom part of the torch to render a small square shadow.

=== Placement ===
In general, torches can be placed only on solid, opaque, full blocks; exceptions are listed below.
