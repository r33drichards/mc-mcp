'''Silk Touch''' is an [[Enchanting|enchantment]] applied to [[tool]]s that causes certain blocks to drop themselves instead of their normal drops.

== Obtaining ==
Silk Touch can be obtained from [[enchanting table]]s, drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]]{{only|Bedrock}}, books obtained by [[fishing]], [[monster room]] chests, librarian [[villager]]s, and non-village [[structure]] loot.

== Usage ==
Silk Touch changes the items dropped from [[mining]] certain blocks. For example, mining a [[stone]] block using a [[pickaxe]] without Silk Touch would drop [[cobblestone]]; however, when using a pickaxe with Silk Touch, the stone block itself drops. The table below lists blocks that do not normally drop themselves as items:

== Incompatibilities ==
Silk Touch is incompatible with [[Fortune]]. If [[commands]] are used to apply both Silk Touch and Fortune to an item, the Silk Touch enchantment takes precedence over the Fortune enchantment for blocks affected by both enchantments.

Silk Touch cannot be applied to [[sword]]s or [[fishing rod]]s in normal gameplay.
