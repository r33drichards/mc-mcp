'''17w48a''' is the eighth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on November 27, 2017<ref>{{snap|17w48a|November 27, 2017}}</ref>.

== Changes ==
=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Tweaks to the command suggestion UI.
* Reworked tab-completion for coordinates.
** When not targeting a block, tab-completion now inserts the coordinates of the [[air]] the [[player]] is looking at 6 blocks away instead of <code>~ ~ ~</code>.
** Coordinates inserted are block (integers) coordinates when the command used relates to [[block]]s.

=== General ===
'''Crafting'''
* Custom recipes are now loaded from data packs in <code>data/(namespace)/recipes/(name).json</code>.
* Turning off the <code>vanilla</code> data pack also removes all recipes.

'''Death messages'''
* Added death message for when the player is blown up by a bed in the Nether or End.
** "''Player'' was killed by [Intentional Game Design]".
*** Clicking on "[Intentional Game Design]" opens a link to {{bug|MCPE-28723}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
* Changed format number to <code>4</code>, due to [[Flattening|The "Flattening"]].
