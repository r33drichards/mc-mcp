Enables [[flying]] for a player regardless of [[gamemode]]. If no player is specified, toggles the current player to fly.

Flying stops upon touching the ground in [[survival]] and [[adventure]] mode. Therefore, the player must execute this command mid-air to fly.

Upon succeed, the command prints <code>[PlayerName]: Take to the Air!</code>. The selected player flies similar to [[creative mode]] if [[flying]] is toggled to true.
