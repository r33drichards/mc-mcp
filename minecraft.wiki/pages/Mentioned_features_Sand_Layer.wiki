'''Sand layers''' were a variation of [[snow]], made of sand instead. They were used for testing the game's lighting engine, and were accidentally shown in the background of a picture featuring [[camel]]s.

== History ==
On August 2, 2023, [[Jacek Wołkowicz]] posted an image to social media, joking that the changelog for [[Java Edition 23w31a]] "missed [[camel]] tables." Behind the "table" was a series of sand layers.<ref>{{tweet|gnembon_mc|1686814321827860480|Hmm, the changelog of 23w31a failed to mention the new functionality of camel tables. Terrible oversight...|August 2, 2023}}</ref>

Following the release of the post, many believed it was a teaser for a new feature, leading to an explicit deconfirmation and explanation.

{{Quote|For those that get hyped up from my previous post - its my bad. I just, by accident, was using the same world for fixing camel standing up into block and to test light effect on retextured snow layers with high random tick speed. Nothing more than that...|[[Gnembon]]<ref>{{tweet|gnembon_mc|1686953975801634816|For those that get hyped up from my previous post - its my bad.

Definitely, don't get attached to these. I should have double checked what I have in the background before posting :(|August 2, 2023}}</ref>|image=Gnembon.png}}
