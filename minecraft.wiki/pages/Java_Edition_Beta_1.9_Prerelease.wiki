'''Beta 1.9 Prerelease''' is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.0.0]], released on September 22, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|116880362793222144|Minecraft Beta 1.9 prerelease can be found here, http://assets.minecraft.net/1_9-pre/minecraft.jar (server jar also available)|September 22, 2011}}</ref> which adds [[Nether fortress]]es, 6 new blocks including [[Nether bricks]] and some variants, 5 new mobs including [[villager]]s and [[blaze]]s, 4 new items including [[ghast tear]]s, the [[mushroom island]] biome, and makes some minor changes.

While initially a pre-release for Beta 1.9, Mojang instead opted to delay the release of this update until [[MINECON 2011]] and release it under the name "Minecraft [[Java Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]]". This decision was made after a few development versions labelled as Beta 1.9 were already released, so the Beta 1.9 name was kept for all of the development versions in the gap between [[Beta 1.8.1]] and [[Java Edition 1.0.0|''Minecraft'' 1.0.0]], excluding the release candidates ([[Java Edition RC1|RC1]] and [[Java Edition RC2|RC2]]).
