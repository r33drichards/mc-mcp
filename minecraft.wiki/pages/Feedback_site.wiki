== Trivia ==
* There was a 27th category about what to name the Piglin Beast, announced at [[MINECON Live 2019]]. It was decided on the name [[hoglin]], and the category was removed, no longer having a use.
* The site does not show commenter and suggestor names, but rather as “Registered User”, and they cannot be clicked on. It is unknown when or if this will be fixed.
* Most users have been unable to log into the website since before September 2023 due to {{bug|WEB-6665}}.
