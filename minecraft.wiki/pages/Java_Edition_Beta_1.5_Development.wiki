== Differences from Beta 1.5 ==
=== General ===
'''[[Weather]]'''
* The snowfall looks slightly different.

'''[[Inventory|Inventory menu]]'''
* Under the inventory itself, there are the "Achievements" and the "Statistics" buttons.

'''[[Achievement/Java Edition|Achievements]]'''
* There are only the first three achievements: Taking inventory, Getting wood, and Benchmarking.
** Only the first words of the achievements' names are capitalized (the "E" of Taking inventory isn't too).
** The layering of the icon for Benchmarking is glitched.
* The background of the achievements screen resembles dirt instead of stone and ores.
* The green lines and the grayed out ones used to connect two achievements that aren't both complete are missing.
* There in no Taken! text that usually appears when you complete an achievement, and no period at the end of Taking inventory's description.
* In the top right corner there is a map of the whole achievements tree, that's bigger than usual but almost empty.
* Under the map there is the description of When Pigs Fly, written like the achievements text in the top left corner.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* The dirt background is lighter.
* The "Distance by Minecart", "Distance by boat", and "Distance by pig" statistics are missing.
* Some of the blocks' icons are slightly different.
