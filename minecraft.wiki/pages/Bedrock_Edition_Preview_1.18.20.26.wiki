== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|placefeature}}'''
* Used to place a configured feature at a given location.
* Was removed in the next beta due to the commands being not fully implemented yet.<ref>{{tweet|MattGartzke|1491601001618366467|@MCPE4theBeacon Not quite ready for full implementation. You might see it go away in the next beta, but the team is still working hard on it!}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Hunger]]'''
* The rate of hunger depletion can now be changed with behavior packs ([[add-on]]s).
* [[Exhaustion]] levels: the rate that hunger decreases has been changed to better match {{JE}}, so [[player]]s can now properly lose hunger when sprinting or swimming and lose significantly less hunger when jumping.
