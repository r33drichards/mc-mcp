'''0.0.10a''' is a version of [[Java Edition Classic]] released on May 17, 2009, at 11:53 UTC,<ref name="logs">{{link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528035558/https://echelog.com/logs/browse/lwjgl/1242511200|title=lwjgl IRC logs|website=Echelog|date=May 17, 2009 (UTC+2)}} "''[13:53:09] <Notch_> 0.0.10a should be up now''" [...] "''[13:53:34] <Notch_> I forgot to take out the normal start() and destroy()..''" [...] "''[13:56:55] <Notch_> ok, it's up. 0.0.11a''"</ref> to increase stability and add the ability to unhook the mouse. This is the last [[Classic Alpha]] version before the public availability of the game with version [[0.0.11a]].

This version was originally planned to be released to the public, but a bug with the start and destroy functions made the game unplayable. It was quickly replaced by [[Classic 0.0.11a|0.0.11a]] after only 4 minutes,<ref name="logs"/> which was then released publicly.
