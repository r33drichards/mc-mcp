== Usage ==
Ice bombs can be thrown by {{control|using}} them, similar to an [[egg]]. They are affected by gravity.

Similar to [[ender pearl]]s, there is a short cooldown before the [[player]] can throw another ice bomb. The cooldown is shown in the hotbar by a white overlay that shrinks before the player is able to use it again.

Ice bombs explode upon hitting most blocks, including non-solid blocks, but not [[air]]. They also explode upon hitting other entities, but they do not take any damage, and unlike [[egg]]s and [[snowball]]s, the impact is not considered an attack and does no damage or knockback. When exploding, any [[water]] (including flowing water, but not [[waterlogged]] blocks) in a 3×3×3 cube around the ice bomb freezes into [[ice]]. Ice bombs can be used to contain and displace mobs in ice under water.

While [[endermen]] teleport away from arrows shot at them, they can be hit by ice bombs. 

Throwing an ice bomb while underwater encloses the player in [[ice]].

In ''[[Minecraft Education]]'', [[breeze]]s are able to deflect ice bombs.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|projects=mcpe}}

== Trivia ==
* In real life, mixing a sufficient amount of sodium acetate in water does solidify it, but creates [[wikipedia:Sodium acetate#Heating pad|hot ice]] (sodium acetate trihydrate) instead of normal ice.
* Its texture closely resembles a recolored blue version of the [[ruby]], without its outlines.
