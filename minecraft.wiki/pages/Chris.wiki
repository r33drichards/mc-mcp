'''"Chris"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]''.

== Track description ==
Continuing from "[[Clark]]" and sharing some of the same melodies, "Chris" begins with the same synth sounds that "Clark" ends with, playing chords in the same key. The synth chords are joined by the synth bass playing an accompaniment before it becomes a more upbeat, though bittersweet piece with a whistling synth and some light percussion.

At the end of the song, the song segues into "[[Music Disc 13|Thirteen]]".

== Trivia ==
*In conjunction with "[[Clark]]", the track is possibly named after musician [https://throttleclark.com/about/ Chris Clark], who has been cited by C418 as an inspiration.<ref>{{ytl|4mn47MqhbFY|10 Years of the Minecraft Soundtrack - C418 INTERVIEW|fantano|January 7, 2021}}</ref>
