'''Instant Damage''' is an instant [[status effect]] that decreases [[health]] for players and living [[mob]]s and heals the [[undead]].

== Effect ==
Instant Damage inflicts magic [[damage]] of {{hp|3}} × 2<sup>''level''</sup>. [[Undead]] mobs are healed as if with [[Instant Health]] instead. [[Death]] is reported as "<''player''> was killed by magic". When applied using a [[lingering potion]], damage is inflicted every second. As this is magic damage, it can be decreased only via [[Resistance]] and [[Protection]].
