An '''iron golem''' is a buildable [[neutral mob]] that attacks monsters with its arms, knocking them into the air. Iron golems are created by [[villager]]s to patrol and protect their [[village]]s. Villager-created iron golems will retaliate against [[player]]s if attacked, and are hostile to players that have low [[Village mechanics|popularity or reputation]] with their village.

== Spawning ==
=== Villages ===
;''Java Edition''
{{IN|java}}, [[villager]]s can [[Villager#Iron golem summoning|summon iron golems]], either when they are [[Villager#Gossiping|gossiping]] or every 5 seconds while [[Villager#Panicking|panicking]] and the following criteria are met:
# The villager has slept in the last 20 minutes
# The villager has not detected an iron golem in the last 30 seconds
#* An iron golem is detected when it is within 16 blocks of the villager (±16'''X''' ±16'''Z''' ±16'''Y''' axis), and the villager scans for golems once every 10 seconds
# The villager has not been near a summoning in the last 30 seconds 
#* A villager is near a summoning when it is within 10 blocks of a villager (±10'''X''' ±10'''Z''' ±10'''Y''' axis) who successfully summons an iron golem
# There are enough participants within 10 blocks of the villager, including the villager itself; participating villagers need to fulfill the previous 3 conditions: When [[gossip]]ing, 5 or more participants are needed. When [[Villager#Panicking|panicking]], 3 or more are needed
# A valid spawn point for the golem is found

Iron golems still spawn even when the [[game rule]] {{cd|doMobSpawning}} is set to {{cd|false}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-111004||Iron golems do not follow the doMobSpawning gamerule}}</ref>

To find a valid spawn point, up to 10 attempts are made to spawn a golem within a 17×13×17 box centered on the villager (villager block position ±8 blocks along x/z axes and ±6 blocks along y axis). A random y column is picked and then the topmost block in that column is selected that is air or liquid and has a "[[Block properties/Solid (legacy)#Iron golem summoning|solid-blocking]]" block underneath. 

The target location is then checked whether the block underneath has a solid top surface (which is not the same as "solid-blocking"). The target block and 2 blocks above must not be a full block, nor be redstone-powered, nor be rails, and the two blocks above must not be water. This means the iron golem can spawn inside 1-deep water or inside blocks like slabs, fences, and carpets (if other checks pass). Adjacent blocks are irrelevant, so golems can spawn partially inside adjacent solid blocks.<ref>{{bug|MC-189332}}</ref> However, the spawning iron golem still must not collide with any existing entities.

;''Bedrock Edition''
{{IN|bedrock}}, an iron golem can spawn naturally when a [[village]] first generates in the world. Iron golems also spawn in villages having at least 20 [[bed]]s and 10 villagers. The golem attempts to spawn in a 17×13×17 volume, ±8 blocks horizontal and ±6 blocks vertical from the village's center block, which can be (but isn't necessarily) a bed pillow or a [[bell]]. 

First, X and Z coordinates are randomly chosen within the spawn volume. Next, the highest block at those coordinates within the spawn volume is found. If it is a block with a full top surface &mdash; including [[glass]], [[Stairs|upside-down stairs]], [[Slab|top slabs]], [[Hopper|hoppers]] (though this has varied with version), and even [[water]] (including source blocks) &mdash; and there is no obstruction above it by a block above the spawn volume, then the golem spawns there. Otherwise, the spawn attempt is canceled. 

For a village to spawn iron golems, 75% of its villagers must have been able to work (reach their linked work block during a working period) in the past day {{Needs testing|last day or last working period? and how are nitwits counted?|bedrock=1}}, and 100% of them must be linked to a bed. Additionally, the village center must be within a player's [[simulation distance]] volume.

The maximum distance the player can be from the village for iron golems to spawn can be calculated with the following formulas. These are approximate because they yield a cuboid volume, but the simulation distance volume is an octahedral shape based on [[taxicab distance]].

:<math>\mathsf{Horizontal} = 8 \times \mathsf{SimulationDistance} + 32</math>
:<math>\mathsf{Vertical} = 8 \times \mathsf{SimulationDistance} + 12</math>

If the village's original iron golem is killed, a new one cannot spawn unless all of the conditions are met. Therefore, a small village does not regenerate an iron golem unless the village is expanded.

If the spawn conditions are met, then the chance of attempting a spawn is {{frac|1|700}} per game tick, which averages to one spawn attempt every 35 seconds. Iron golems can spawn provided the 2×3×2 space above the spawn point (that is, horizontally centered on the northwest corner of the block it spawns on) contains only non-full blocks, and the block it spawns on is [[Block properties/Solid (legacy)#Iron golem summoning|solid-blocking]].

An additional iron golem spawns for each additional 10 villagers beyond the initial population requirement, provided that the other requirements are met.

=== Creation ===
{{FakeImage|align=left|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Carved Pumpkin|i=Block of Iron| p |iii| i }}|Iron golem build configuration.}}
{{FakeImage|align=left|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Jack o'Lantern|i=Block of Iron| p |iii| i }}|Iron golem build configuration with a jack o'lantern.}}

Iron golems are created by placing four [[iron block]]s in a T shape (as shown in the image), and then placing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]] on top of the center upper block. The pumpkin may be placed by the player, a [[dispenser]] or an [[enderman]], but it must be placed last. Alternatively, the blocks can be placed in any order with an uncarved [[pumpkin]]; the player can [[shear]] the pumpkin to spawn the golem.

When successfully created, the iron golem is naturally passive toward all players under all circumstances. It can, however, attack the player’s tamed [[wolves]], if punched accidentally, but it never directly attacks the player. The constructed golem attacks hostile mobs like a naturally spawned iron golem.

The block arrangement can be placed upright, lying down, or upside-down. The four empty spaces in the diagram (above and below each of the arms) must be [[air]] blocks. Any non-air block (including blocks such as [[snow]] layers, [[grass]], and [[water]]) present in any of the empty spaces prevent the golem from spawning. 

Like other constructed [[mob]]s, iron golems always spawn facing south. Their large size may cause them to take suffocation damage from nearby solid [[block]]s at the level of their head.

=== Pillager outposts ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Defeating a pillager outpost}}
[[File:Pillager outpost feature cage2.png|thumb|An iron golem trapped in a cage at a [[pillager outpost]].]]
Iron golems can also be found surrounding [[pillager outpost]]s, confined inside dark oak cages. When freed, they can help the player by attacking any nearby [[pillager]]s. Pillagers can technically attack iron golems in cages if they fall in, though it is unlikely that they will succeed on their own. Iron golems can also attack pillagers from within the cage due to being able to attack through 1 block walls, assuming that it sees a pillager through an [[air]] block.

{{IN|BE}}, [[trading]] prices are unaffected by the killing of iron golems; however, [[Village_mechanics#Popularity|village popularity]] decreases by 10, affecting village iron golem behavior if the popularity ranges below -15.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Irongolemflower.png|thumb|upright|An iron golem offering a [[poppy]].]]
Iron golems wander around a [[village]] in a patrol-like fashion, staying close to buildings and other structures. Like [[villager]]s, iron golems do not wander away from a village, regardless of how they were spawned, but sometimes stand at the border of the village. 

An iron golem sometimes faces a villager as if they are conversing. Iron golems can spawn [[poppies]] in their hands and offer them to villagers and [[copper golem]]s. Baby villagers accept the poppy offered by the iron golem.{{only|bedrock}}<ref name="baby-bug">Baby villagers have not accepted poppies {{in|java}} since the [[Village & Pillage]] update due to a bug {{bug|MC-159069}}.</ref> Attacking an iron golem that is not player-built while the iron golem is holding out a poppy causes it to take back the poppy and attack the player instead. If the iron golem sees a target while it is offering the poppy, it runs toward the target and kills the target instead.

{{IN|BE}}, iron golems completely ignore villagers, pushing them aside while walking if a villager is in the iron golem's path, but they still offer poppies if possible.

If not within a village, iron golems slowly wander around attacking hostile mobs, (skeletons, zombies, etc.) usually making their way to a nearby village. If in that village, the iron golem doesn't leave.

Iron golems can walk up a full [[block]] height without jumping and walk over a 1 block wide hole without falling in. They avoid [[water]], [[lava]], [[fire]], and [[cactus]]. Iron golems are immune to both [[drowning]] and [[fall damage]]. When in water they sink to the bottom, but can still move laterally and walk up full blocks as if they were on land.

As with most passive and neutral mobs, iron golems can be [[leash]]ed. The leashed iron golem does not try to break from the lead when it sees a hostile mob, instead looking at the mob while it moves. An iron golem that is leashed in mid-air moves its arms and legs while moving. If an iron golem is leashed to a fence, it attacks hostile mobs, but does not follow them if they leave the leash range as the iron golem cannot break free from fence leads.

{{IN|java}}, Iron golems that aren't provoked move slower. Iron golems move faster {{in|bedrock}}, as its normal walking speed is fast regardless of being provoked.

Iron golems cannot pick up weapons or armor, but the player can use NBT commands {{in|java}} or the [[Commands/replaceitem|/replaceitem]] command {{in|bedrock}} to give the iron golem weapons or armor, although the armor or weapons are not visible.

=== Attacking ===
When attacking, an iron golem moves quickly toward its target and swings its arms up violently to attack, flinging the target into the air and dealing damage in a random range set by [[difficulty]], between as low as {{hp|4.75}} damage on Easy difficulty and as high as {{hp|32.25}} damage on Hard difficulty. Iron golems cannot attack targets that are three blocks above them. As such, standing on a three block pillar will allow players to attack golems below them without retaliation.

It is possible for multiple golems to hit the same target simultaneously, flinging the victim to a height proportional to the number of golems that attacked.{{only|bedrock}}{{verify}}

If an iron golem attacks a group of mobs, it targets one mob to attack until that mob dies before attacking a different mob, even while being attacked by other mobs.

If the mob is flung out of sight, the iron golem attacks the next mob that attacks it. Sometimes, the iron golem might attack the nearest hostile mob if they are in groups.{{verify}}

When an iron golem kills any mob, the player can obtain items dropped by the mob, but no experience orbs. An iron golem that kills a raid mob {{in|BE}} also causes the mob to drop its raid loot, even when the mob wasn't attacked by the player before it was killed.

Iron golems never attack each other, as iron golems cannot "accidentally" hit another iron golem when attacking.

==== Provocation by players ====
An iron golem built by a player never attacks players, even when hit or when the player attacks another villager or another golem in front of the player-built golem, though they will attack a player's tamed wolf if the wolf attacks the golem.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a naturally-spawned iron golem immediately becomes hostile toward a player who attacks a villager near an iron golem. 

If a player has -15 [[popularity]] or less in a village, or has -100 or lower reputation with any nearby villager, naturally-spawned iron golems become hostile to that player until the player's popularity climbs above -15 ''and'' reputation with all nearby villagers goes above -100.

A village iron golem retaliates when attacked by a player, even if the attack dealt no damage such as an [[ender pearl]] or [[snowball]]. If a village has more than one naturally-spawned iron golem and a player attacks one in front of the other(s), all iron golems of that type may become hostile to the player.{{only|bedrock}}{{verify|Does not occur on JE outside of regular reputation behaviour, test BE}}

Iron golems are not provoked by players who attack [[wandering trader]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-153693|||WAI}}</ref>

==== Provocation by other mobs ====
{{Anchor|Provocation by hostile mobs}}

Although they are guardians of villages, iron golems are not actually provoked when a mob attacks a nearby villager (in contrast to a player attacking a villager{{only|bedrock}}), given that the iron golem is not already hostile to the type of mob by default. With the exception of [[creeper]]s and [[goat]]s, they are provoked when attacked by any mob, and by the ''presence'' of nearby monsters. Even if a witch accidentally throws a positive splash potion at an iron golem during a raid, this does not stop the iron golem from attacking the witch. Iron golems are ineffective against flying hostile mobs that don't venture into the iron golem's reach, such as [[ghast]]s and [[phantom]]s.

The list below contains mobs that can have hostile interactions with iron golems. The iron golem also attacks neutral mobs or hostile mobs that can attack the player, such as piglins or zombified piglins.

[[File:Iron Golem Looking Down.png|thumb|An iron golem looks down at a husk, but cannot attack the husk.]]
A naturally-spawned iron golem knows where raiding [[illager]] locations are from behind solid walls and from underground and attempts to move toward them. An iron golem created by the player or summoned by a [[command]] cannot detect raiders through obstructions. Iron golems also look up or down if the hostile mob is above or below the iron golem.

=== Being attacked===
[[Zombie]]s (and variants), [[zoglin]]s, [[skeleton]]s (and variants), [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, [[slime]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[wither]]s, [[ravager]]s and [[illager]]s naturally attack iron golems on sight and may cause major damage, especially if the mobs attack in groups. {{IN|Bedrock}}, [[silverfish]] and [[witch]]es also naturally attack iron golems without provocation.

Iron golems have 100% knockback resistance from normal attacks. However, they can be knocked back by wind charges and the Wind Burst enchantment.

=== Cracking ===
Iron golems have different stages of being cracked to show their health. When their health is at or above 75%, they do not have any cracks. When their health is at or above 50% but lower than 75%, some cracks appear. When their health is at or above 25% but lower than 50%, they appear more cracked. When their health is lower than 25%, many cracks are visible.
<gallery>
Iron Golem.png|No deterioration <br />(75% of health remaining or more)
Iron Golem Cracked Low.png|Low deterioration <br />(Between 74% and 50%  remaining) 
Iron Golem Cracked Medium.png|Average deterioration <br />(Between 49% and 25%  remaining) 
Iron Golem Cracked High.png|Strong deterioration <br />(Less than 25% remaining)
</gallery>

=== Healing ===
{{control|Using}} an [[iron ingot]] on an iron golem removes one deterioration level, or in other words, adds {{hp|25}} to its health, consuming the ingot.

Iron golems attempt to walk on a one-block-wide path, despite them being two blocks wide. An iron golem favors a wider path if it sees one.

Iron golems can climb ladders or vines if the ladder or vine is in its path, or if pushed onto a ladder or vine.

[[File:Castleintheskyrobot.png|thumb|right|Robot from ''Laputa: Castle in the Sky'']]

*The iron golem's holding out [[flower]]s to [[villager]]s is a reference to the ancient robots in Hayao Miyazaki's animated film {{W|Castle in the Sky|''Laputa: Castle in the Sky''|newtab=1}}.<ref>{{tweet|jonkagstrom|172728720799436801|@scambot Yes, thanks to @pgeuder who sent me inspirational pictures!|February 23, 2012}}</ref> When baby villagers notice the poppy in its hand, they slowly approach, and take the flower eventually.<ref name="baby-bug" /> Iron golems do not actually pick up poppies; they spawn them in their hands.
*Another inspiration was {{W|The Iron Giant|''The Iron Giant''|newtab=1}}, about an extraterrestrial war machine that crash landed on Earth and found a new life as a pacifist, motivated by {{W|Superman|newtab=1}}.<ref>{{YouTube link|gTpKcXUHpUE|The Iron Guardian We (Don't?) Deserve {{!}} The Story Of The Iron Golem|Minecraft|November 24, 2024}}</ref>
*Iron golems do not get into boats or minecarts on their own, although {{in|bedrock}}, pushing a minecart on rails into a golem forces it into the minecart.
*It is possible for an [[enderman]] to cause an iron golem to spawn by placing a pumpkin in the correct position on an arrangement of iron blocks previously placed by the player.
*The iron golem is a purchasable avatar item on the Xbox 360 Marketplace.
* It is impossible to spawn an iron golem holding a poppy using a command (such as <code>summon</code> or <code>data</code>). Its NBT matches with a naturally generated golem (<code>equipment:{mainhand:{id:"minecraft:poppy",count:1}}</code>), but does not visually update.
* The iron golem has a smaller [[LEGO Minecraft|LEGO]] variant exclusive from "Advent Calender 2025", as well as one of the [[warden]].
