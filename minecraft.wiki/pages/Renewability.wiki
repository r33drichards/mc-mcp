'''Renewability''' refers to the possibility of an [[item]] or [[block]] to be obtained continuously without exploring new areas or having additional players join. There exist 2 pages with an explanation of it:

* [[Renewable resource]]: Resources that can be renewed in [[Survival]], without the use of cheats or duplication exploits.
* [[Non-renewable resource]]: Resources that can't be renewed in Survival.
The '''renewability''' of an [[item]] or [[block]] includes the use of farms (including [[automatic farm]]s) and factors in elements such as technically limited but abundant resources.
