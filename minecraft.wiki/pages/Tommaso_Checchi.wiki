'''Tommaso Checchi''' ([[Wikipedia:Help:IPA/Italian|/ˈkɛkˌki/]] <small>''KEHk-kee''</small>) is a former member of the Minecraft Redmond team.
Initially, Tommaso wanted to be an artist, but decided to learn programming since he "couldn't wait for people to program for him". Setting his sights on making games, he started with multimedia fusion game makers and later learned C++.<ref>{{ytl|vhs|t=25m45s}}</ref>

Before working on ''Minecraft'', Tommaso was a programmer on [[Mojang Studios#Cobalt|Cobalt's]] game engine. [[Jeb]] acknowledges him as being good at working on C++ and graphics/rendering.<ref>{{ytl|opppP_RTJmo}}</ref>

He formerly worked for the team of development for Minecraft ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''.<ref>{{tweet|jbernhardsson|359302935940825092|Awesome news, @_tomcc started working on Pocket Edition today! :)|July 22, 2013}}</ref> He also stated that while [[Johan Bernhardsson|Johan]] was working on the "hard stuff", such as [[Realms]], he would work on the "missing & easy things",<ref name=easystuff>{{tweet|tomcc|360809345358901248|@Onlyadirector yep! @jbernhardsson is still at hard work on the "hard stuff" (Realms, etc) so I thought to add some missing&easy things!|July 26, 2013}}</ref> such as [[splash]] text to the main menu in ''Pocket Edition''.<ref>{{tweet|tomcc|359707235535974400|Here's a pic for the unbelievers, I'll just have to write all the splashes now.. I think I know why it wasn't there!|July 23, 2013}}</ref>
He also worked on the game's graphics, such as adding improvements to the [[sky]], glowing [[spider]] eyes, updated [[chest]] model,<ref>{{tweet|tomcc|362254447889481731|@CalisPE I'm working on them, hope so… for now I've fixed the normal ones, and they open and close :)|July 30, 2013}}</ref> [[zombies]] and [[skeletons]] lighting on fire under [[sun]]light,<ref>{{tweet|tomcc|361920203069730817|@CuevasJacob @craftking57 actually I checked now :D yeah, it's not there.. that had probably a reason though!|July 29, 2013}}</ref> shadows and mipmaps.<ref>{{tweet|tomcc|391238072580325377|oh yeah right. Here, have a screenshot!|October 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|sub=MCPE|1ooanh/thanks_pe_devs_for_putting_so_much_into_one|ccudp83|There will unfortunately not be a new creative inventory or new controlls. They have been pushed to future versions. We hope to get 0.8.0 submitted by mid-november and there are a lot of things to test in 0.8.0. Btw. Tommaso has also optimized performance so some of you guys will be able to turn up your viewing distance. :) Edit: that should be survival inventory. :/|jbernhardsson|October 18, 2013}}</ref> 
In February of 2017, he transferred from the Mojang office and moved to Seattle to continue work on {{el|be}} in the Minecraft Redmond office.<ref>{{tweet|tomcc|827738292388929536|So, it happened that I left @Mojang to move to Microsoft! But don’t despair, I’ll still work on Minecraft Pocket :)|February 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|tomcc|827738495682695168|It also means that I moved from Stockholm to Seattle, for now it’s going ok but I’ll miss Sweden :)|February 3, 2017}}</ref>

On June 18, 2022, Tommaso tweeted that he had left the Minecraft Redmond team in 2021.<ref>{{tweet|tomcc|1538271162722971648|Btw, I left Minecraft a bit more than a year ago, so I didn't really have much to talk about on here. I do have some projects going on on the side however... maybe there will be gifs one day :)|June 18, 2022}}</ref>
