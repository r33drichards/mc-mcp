'''Slimes''' are cube-shaped [[hostile mob]]s that spawn deep underground in particular [[chunk]]s, aboveground in [[swamp]]s, or when an [[Oozing]]-affected [[entity]] dies. They move by jumping, chase after their targets, and usually deal [[damage]] on touch. Slimes spawn in different sizes, and larger ones split into smaller ones on death.

== Spawning ==
{{See also|Tutorial:Slime farming}}
Slimes spawn naturally in 3 sizes: small, medium, and large. A fourth size, known as semi-large, only spawns from [[trial spawner]]s and never naturally. Slimes have an [[NBT]] tag, {{nbt|byte|Size}}, which determines their size. Small, medium, and big slimes have their <code>Size</code> set to {{cd|0|1|3|d=and}} respectively. Using the {{command|summon}} or {{command|data}} commands, a slime can be given any <code>Size</code> in the range <span style="display:inline-block;">from {{cd|0|126|d= to }} (inclusive).{{verify|edition=bedrock|Is there a different maximum size in Bedrock Edition, and if so what is it?}}</span>
<!--
Like most other hostile mobs, slimes do not spawn within 24 blocks (spherical) of any player, despawn over time if no player is within 32 blocks, and despawn instantly if no player is within the despawn radius (128 blocks {{in|java}}, 44 to 128 blocks {{in|bedrock}} depending on [[simulation distance]]{{verify|Uncertain what the was actually changed to fix MCPE-79359}}).-->

A slime needs a space of 2.04×2.04×2.04 blocks to spawn, which must be clear of solid and liquid obstructions. When a slime attempts to spawn, the game checks to see if the space requirement is followed. Therefore, small and medium slimes are not able to spawn in 2-block tall areas even though it would normally be enough room for other small mobs. Any block within the space, even a [[glass pane]], can prevent slimes from spawning.
[[File:2.04x2.04.png|300px|thumb|A 2.04 x 2.04 x 2.04 block space.]]
* A [[button]] or any block without a collision hitbox can prevent a mob from spawning on the block below it, but does not count as an obstruction. This is because the game looks for an [[air]] block above it when trying to spawn a mob.
* {{IN|Java}}, the space is centered on the top face of the block the slime spawns on.
** It should be noted that a [[trapdoor]] is treated like a full-block when the game looks for space to spawn mobs. Therefore, the effective spawning space the slime needs is 3×2.1×3 blocks.
* {{IN|Bedrock}}, the space is centered in the northwest corner of a block. This means the effective spawning region is 2×2×2 blocks.{{verify|edition=bedrock|Mobs spawn in the northwest corner, and therefore the spawning area should be different. Also, can a chest obstruct slime spawning in the 3×1×3 block square containing the chest in the southeasy corder? If so, then this needs say the effective region is the same as the region the game checks.}}

The random distribution of slime sizes is affected by [[regional difficulty]]: chances range from 33% for each size at the low difficulty to 16% small, 33% medium, and 50% big with higher difficulty.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Swamps ===
Slimes can spawn in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s between the altitudes of Y=51 and Y=69 (inclusive) when the provided light level is 7 or less. They spawn most often on a [[Moon#Phases|full moon]], and never on a new moon.

More precisely, the game checks two factors:

# If the light level is equal to or less than a random integer (from 0 to 7)
# If the fraction of the moon that is bright is greater than a random number (from 0 to 1)

If these conditions are met and the altitude is acceptable, there is a 50% chance of spawning a slime.

The light level requirement for slime spawning in swamps is different from that of most hostile mobs, which spawn only at light level 0.<ref>{{bug|MC-252424||Slimes spawn at light levels greater then 0 in Swamps|WAI}}</ref> This allows slimes in swamps to spawn in dimly-lit areas where most hostile mobs can't, allowing swamp-based slime farms to be built.

=== Slime chunks ===
{{anchor|Low layers}}

Slimes spawn in the [[Overworld]] in slime chunks below the [[altitude|layer]] of Y=40 in groups of four{{Only|Java|short=JE}} or individually{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}, regardless of the [[Light#Light level|lighting]] or [[weather]] conditions.

About {{frac|1|10}} of all [[chunks]] are generated as slime chunks, but they are not determined randomly. An algorithm is used to determine whether each chunk is a slime chunk. {{IN|je}}, whether a chunk at a particular set of coordinates becomes a slime chunk is determined by the world's [[Seed (world generation)|seed]]. {{IN|be}}, however, they are generated at the same coordinates in every world.


{{Calculator|chunkbase|pois=Sc|zoom=1.1|terrain=false}}

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
{{IN|java}}, slime chunks are determined pseudo-randomly by combining their chunk coordinates with the [[Seed (world generation)|seed of the world]].

This Java code can be used to print a message to the terminal indicating whether one specific chunk is a slime chunk.{{verify|type=current|edition=java|I've been testing this code all day and I've tried everything but it doesn't seem to agree with ChunkBase. I'm grateful that someone tried to find the code for slime chunks and then put it here, but it seems they must have made a mistake.}}

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
import java.util.Random; 

public class CheckSlimechunk {
    
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // the seed from /seed as a 64bit long literal
        long seed = 12345L;
        int xPosition = 4296;
        int zPosition = 843;
        
        Random rnd = new Random(
                seed +
                (int) (xPosition * xPosition * 0x4c1906) +
                (int) (xPosition * 0x5ac0db) +
                (int) (zPosition * zPosition) * 0x4307a7L +
                (int) (zPosition * 0x5f24f) ^ 0x3ad8025fL
        );
        
        System.out.println(rnd.nextInt(10) == 0);
    } 
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The chunk coordinates and the world seed are combined to make a specific RNG seed to generate a random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). If the random integer is 0, then the chunk is a slime chunk. World coordinates can be converted to chunk coordinates by dividing by 16 and then rounding down. The world coordinates and the chunk coordinates are both 32-bit integers (instances of <code>int</code>).

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
{{IN|bedrock}}, the algorithm does not depend on the world seed, so the chunks that slimes can naturally spawn in inhabit the same coordinates for every world.<ref>The Bedrock Edition slime chunk algorithm was reverse engineered by @protolambda and @jocopa3 and can be found on GitHub:[https://github.com/depressed-pho/slime-finder-pe]</ref>

=== Trial spawners ===
Each [[trial chamber]]s structure has a 25% chance to select slimes as the "small melee" mob for its [[trial spawner]]s. This means only about 25% of trial chambers contain slime spawners within them.

Slimes from trial spawners spawn in sizes {{cd|1}} (medium) and {{cd|2}} (semi-large), unlike slimes that spawn in slime chunks and swamps, which come in sizes {{cd|0}}, {{cd|1}} and {{cd|3}} respectively.<ref>{{bug|MC-266502||Trial spawners spawn slimes of "Size: 2" which otherwise never spawn|WAI}}</ref>

During [[ominous trial]]s, each [[ominous trial spawner]] has a {{frac|1|7}} chance to dispense [[lingering potion]]s of Oozing, which spawn two medium slimes upon an affected entity's death. Any type of ominous trial spawner can dispense Oozing potions, regardless of the mob type it spawns.

=== Potions ===
If an entity inflicted with the [[Oozing]] effect dies, two medium-sized slimes appear at its death location.

{{IN|java}}, Oozing only spawns slimes in a 5×5×5 cube up to the maximum [[entity cramming]] count (default to 24).

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
From a single large slime, a player can expect an [[experience]] and [[slimeball]] yield of 12-28 and 0-32, respectively. The average yield from a single large slime is usually around 19 [[experience]] and 9 [[Slimeball|slimeballs]].
==== Large slime ====
*Spawns two to four medium slimes on death
*{{xp|4}} when killed by the player

==== Medium slime ====
*Spawns two to four small slimes on death
*{{xp|2}} when killed by the player

== Behavior ==
[[File:Slime.gif|160px|thumb|A slime jumping.]]
Slimes move by hopping, which they do every 10 to 30 [[tick]]s ({{fraction|1|2}} to {{fraction|1|1|2}} seconds). They can swim in water and climb ladders and scaffolding. Unlike other mobs, slimes continue moving when no players are nearby. Their exact routine is as follows:

The slime searches for a [[player]] (or, failing that, an [[iron golem]]) within 16 blocks (spherical) distance.
* If no target is found, the slime waits 10 to 30 ticks ({{frac|1|2}} to {{frac|1|1|2}} seconds) between jumps, and changes direction randomly every 40 to 100 ticks (2 to 5 seconds).
* If a target is found, the delay before jumping is {{fraction|1|3}} as long (3 to 10 ticks), and the slime's direction is set directly toward the target before jumping.

Unlike most [[mobs]], slimes do not pathfind toward their target, always approaching their target in a straight line without avoiding environmental hazards such as [[lava]], [[cactus]] or dangerous falls. This means they can easily get stuck in corners or behind walls, not knowing how to circumvent them. This behavior is shared by [[magma cube]]s.

A slime's maximum health is equal to its size squared, and its dimensions are 0.51 [[blocks]] times its size in each dimension. When a slime attacks, it deals damage equal to its size, except for size 0 (smallest) slimes, which do no damage, and do not prevent [[sleeping]]. Because small slimes still have a hostile AI, they continuously try to attack the player.

A slime's jump distance also depends on its size; a slime jumps a distance slightly farther than its length. When landing, a number (8 times the slime's size) of slime particles appear. Regardless of size, slimes always jump 1 block high.

When a slime larger than 0 dies, it spawns 2-4 new slimes equivalent to its size divided by 2, rounding down. A slime that was named with a [[name tag]] produces smaller slimes with the same name when it dies.

Slimes continuously damage all players, [[snow golems]]{{only|bedrock}}, and [[iron golems]] they collide with (although [[damage immunity]] reduces the actual damage to 1 attack every half second), unlike other mobs that damage only those targets they specifically attack<ref>{{bug|MC-131426||Slimes have little to no attack cooldown}}</ref> and as a result they deal damage about twice as quickly as other mobs.

Slimes in [[water]] attempt to swim to the surface if possible. If forced to stay submerged, they eventually drown, splitting into smaller slimes that drown and finally drop slimeballs.

Slimes are immune to [[Oozing]].

== Issues ==

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|java}}, the size of slimes can be customized with commands. Sizes go from 1 up to 127; the size-127 slime is the largest of any mob in the game, bigger than the [[ender dragon]].
* Because a slime's movement speed is tied to its size, it becomes impossible for the player to outrun a size 8 slime on flat ground without potion effects.
* When a slime searches for nearby targets or checks to see if it should despawn, it checks from a point at the center of its hitbox on the x and z-axis and the bottom of its y-axis. Therefore, a custom-size slime sufficiently huge can be right in front of the player and be completely passive, and it may even despawn if the slime is large enough.
* Green-colored slimes are also present in ''[[Minicraft]]'', a 2D ''Minecraft''-inspired game also created by Notch.
*A player inside a slime can see the slime itself inside of a slime block.
*Slimes breaking apart to form smaller, independent slimes resembles the real-life form of asexual reproduction known as [[w:Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]].
