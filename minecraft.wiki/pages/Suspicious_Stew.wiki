'''Suspicious stew''' is a [[food]] item that can give the [[player]] a [[effect|status effect]] that depends on the [[flower]] used to craft it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|suspicious-stew,suspicious-stew-2}}

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|Red Mushroom
|Brown Mushroom
|Bowl
|Any Small Flower
|Output=Suspicious Stew
|shapeless=true
|type=Foodstuff
}}

=== Harvesting ===
Suspicious stew can be obtained by “milking” a brown [[mooshroom]] by {{Control|using}} an empty [[bowl]] on it after {{control|using}} a small flower on it. The flower type determines the stew's effect using the same rule as a crafted stew. After being milked once, the brown mooshroom returns to producing [[mushroom stew]] until fed another small flower. Red mooshrooms do not produce suspicious stew.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}
The [[trading]] interface does not indicate the type of suspicious stew being sold, but each trade entry consistently yields the same type of stew, so the player can remember or make a note of the types offered by a given villager. {{IN|bedrock}}, due to {{bug|MCPE-134483}}, all stews sold by farmers grant [[Night Vision]] for 5 seconds.

=== Commands ===
Suspicious stew can be given with [[commands]] like {{cmd|give}}; {{in|java}}, if the [[Data component format#suspicious_stew_effects|<code>suspicious_stew_effect</code> component]] is not specified, consuming the stew doesn't inflict any effect. {{IN|Bedrock}}, different types of suspicious stews can be given by specifying its [[#Metadata|metadata value]].

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management}}
To eat suspicious stew, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|6}} hunger and 7.2 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]] and gives a few seconds of a [[effect|status effect]] that varies depending on which flower was used to craft it. The effect is not displayed in the tooltip, texture, etc., unless the tooltip is viewed from the Creative inventory (including [[saved hotbar]]s), meaning that the player cannot know in advance what the effect is without knowing which flower was used.

{{/Effects}}
The [[bowl]] is emptied and returned to the player after the suspicious stew has been eaten, and can be re-used to craft more stews. Unlike most foods, suspicious stew can be eaten even if the player's hunger bar is full.

The Saturation effect effectively makes the blue orchid and dandelion stews a superfood: In those 7{{only|je|short=true}} or 6{{only|be|short=true}} ticks it can restore up to 7{{only|je|short=true}} or 6{{only|be|short=true}} hunger and 14{{only|je|short=true}} or 12{{only|be|short=true}} saturation points ''on top of'' their food value, for a total of at least {{hunger|13}} hunger, and effectively maximizing saturation. This is the largest amount of hunger and saturation the player can get from a single food item. Regeneration can restore up to {{Health|2}} health, while Poison can inflict up to {{health|8}} damage and Wither up to {{Health|3}} damage.

Consuming suspicious stew is the only way to obtain the Saturation and Blindness effects in vanilla ''Minecraft'' without the use of commands.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Suspicious stew was introduced because developers wanted a way of communicating that [[wikipedia:Lily_of_the_valley|lilies of the valley]] are poisonous.<ref>{{ytl|YUM7XiEX1DI|Items: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft @ 3:32|Minecraft|November 29, 2019|t=212s}}</ref>
* If one excluded the red mushrooms (which are based on a poisonous mushroom), the only suspicious stews that would realistically be edible are the allium, dandelion, cornflower, oxeye daisy, tulip, and azure bluet suspicious stews, as those are the only flowers that are safe to eat in real life.
