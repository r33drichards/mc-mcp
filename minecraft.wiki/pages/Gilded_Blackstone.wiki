'''Gilded blackstone''' is a variant of [[blackstone]] found exclusively in [[bastion remnant]]s, that can drop itself or [[gold nugget]]s when mined.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Gilded blackstone requires a [[pickaxe]] to be mined, in which case it drops itself or [[gold nugget]]s. When mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Gilded blackstone has a 10% chance to drop 2–5 gold nuggets when mined with any pickaxe. If it does not drop gold nuggets, it drops itself as a block. If a gilded blackstone is mined with a [[Silk Touch]] enchanted pickaxe, it always drops itself.

As with the drop chance of [[flint]] from [[gravel]], the [[Fortune]] enchantment does not increase the amount dropped, but increases the ''chance'' of gold nuggets dropping. Fortune I increases the chance for this drop to 14.29% ({{frac|1|7}}), Fortune II increases it to 25%, and Fortune III guarantees the gold nugget drop.

=== Natural generation ===
Gilded blackstone generates as part of [[bastion remnant]]s, replacing some of the blackstone in the structure; they can also be found beneath [[bastion remnant]]s [[chest]]s.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|gilded-blackstone}}

== Usage ==
Gilded blackstone is primarily used for decoration.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s run toward any gilded blackstone item on the ground, and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory.

Piglins become hostile toward players that break gilded blackstone.
