'''''Minecraft: Gear VR Edition'''''<ref name = Release/> was the former title of the version of {{el|be}} designed for [[virtual reality]], which was available for {{w|Samsung Galaxy Note 4}} through {{W|Samsung Galaxy Note 9|Galaxy Note 9}}, and {{W|Samsung Galaxy S6|Galaxy S6}} through {{W|Samsung Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10}}{{fn|This also includes Galaxy Note Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Galaxy S10e.}} through the {{w|Samsung Gear VR}} headset. It had crossplay with ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' and its derived editions. It was released on April 27, 2016,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428124443/https://mojang.com/2016/04/minecraft-arrives-on-gear-vr-today/|title=Minecraft arrives on Gear VR today!|website=Mojang|date=April 27, 2016|author=Marsh Davies}}</ref><ref name="video">{{ytl|_rYfkDmSRKs|Minecraft is Now Available on Gear VR!|Meta Quest|April 27, 2016}}</ref> as a port from [[Pocket Edition v0.14.2 alpha|v0.14.2 alpha]].<ref>{{tweet|MetaQuestVR|725376116987297792|We’re excited to announce that Minecraft: Gear VR Edition is now available! http://ocul.us/Minecraft|April 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Release/> Although ''Pocket Edition'' on the Galaxy Store was discontinued later on, ''Gear VR Edition'' was never made free to owners of ''Pocket Edition'' on that platform. Following the [[Better Together Update]], it is no longer named ''Gear VR Edition''.

As of [[Bedrock Edition 1.16.40|1.16.40]], ''Minecraft'' for Gear VR has not received new feature updates, such as [[Caves & Cliffs]] ''(1.17 & 1.18)'', [[the Wild Update]], [[Trails & Tales]], etcetera, and has been discontinued ever since.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709074718/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-news-regarding-minecraft-mobile|title=Important News Regarding Minecraft Mobile|website=Minecraft.net|date=August 7, 2020|author=Staff}}</ref>

The most recent feature update for ''Minecraft'' on Gear VR devices is the [[Nether Update]].

== Development ==
The idea of ''Minecraft'' for Gear VR devices first started in 2014 with {{wikipedia|John Carmack}}, who at the time was the CTO of {{wikipedia|Reality Labs|Oculus}}. He tweeted the following, 7 months after Notch initially recused Oculus:<ref>{{tweet|notch|448586381565390848|We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.|March 25, 2014}}</ref>

In 2015, John Carmack announced that Oculus Rift will come to Windows 10 next year, but has said that Gear VR is on the way and is essentially being ported from ''[[Pocket Edition]]'':
{{Quote|@Kithop @_tomcc it isn't Win 10 only, it is also GearVR, which the java code was never going to run effectively on. Not Mac/Linux, true.|John Carmack|porting ''Minecraft'' to Oculus Rift and Gear VR<ref>{{tweet|ID_AA_Carmack|652163573787963392}}</ref>}}

''Minecraft: Gear VR Edition'' was then confirmed to be released on the Spring.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11256944/minecraft-gear-vr-john-carmack|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11256944/minecraft-gear-vr-john-carmack/|title=Hands-on with Minecraft for the Gear VR, and why it’s John Carmack’s favorite platform|website=Polygon|date=March 17, 2016|author=Charlie Hall}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://time.com/4260664/minecraft-vr-release-date-john-carmack/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://time.com/4260664/minecraft-vr-release-date-john-carmack/|title=John Carmack Told Us What Makes Minecraft VR So Special|website=Time|date=March 16, 2016|author=Matt Peckham}}</ref>
