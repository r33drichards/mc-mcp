A '''knowledge book''' is a utility item that reveals available [[crafting]] recipes to the player when {{control|used}}.

== Obtaining ==
Knowledge books can be obtained only by using [[commands]], as they are not found in the [[Creative inventory]].

For example, a player can give themselves a knowledge book that reveals the recipes for [[bucket]]s and [[flower pot]]s by running the following command: {{cmd|give @s knowledge_book[recipes{{=}}[bucket,flower_pot]]}}.

== Usage ==
Knowledge books are used to reveal recipes to the player who uses it, by adding it to their [[recipe book]]. Using a knowledge book consumes it, removing it from the player's inventory.

Knowledge books are especially useful to mapmakers in conjunction with {{cmd|gamerule doLimitedCrafting true}}, because then any item is craftable only if its recipe is unlocked first.

{{control|Using}} a [[Chiseled Bookshelf|chiseled bookshelf]] while having a knowledge book in the main hand puts the book inside the chiseled bookshelf.
