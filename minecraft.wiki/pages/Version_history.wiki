[[File:Human Mob.jpg|thumb|One of the first mobs added to the game. It is a reused mob from [[Zombie Town]], which was first added to [[Minecraft]] in the pre-Classic [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-132328|rd-132328]] version, becoming known as the [[Mob (entity)|human]] mob. After its eventual removal from the game, the texture continued to be used for the player model, later becoming known as [[Steve]].]]
