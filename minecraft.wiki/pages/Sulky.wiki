'''Sulky''' is a [[skeleton]] minifigure, and the main focus of ''[[LEGO Minecraft: Skeleton Quest]]''.

== Appearance ==
Sulky is identical to any other LEGO skeleton, only being distinguished by an enchanted [[helmet]] and [[bow]], similar to a [[skeleton horseman]].

== Personality ==
[[Alex]] is drawn to its behavior, following Sulky around and taking note of its quirks. As with other skeletons, Sulky is shown to be aggressive and targeted by [[wolves]], if slightly more intelligent; making a note to avoid interacting with a structure dedicated to them.
