'''13w10b''' is the fifteenth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on March 6, 2013<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-snapshot-13w10b/</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[13w10a]] snapshot.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dispenser]]s and [[dropper]]s'''
* Now only fire once when they receive a redstone signal.
** To fire again, the signal must be turned off and on again. (Previously they would fire whenever they had a signal and a nearby block changed)
