[[File:PunchTrees-GetWood.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[player]] mines a [[tree]] and obtains a [[log]].]]
'''Breaking''', '''digging''', '''punching''', or '''mining''' is a common activity in ''[[Minecraft]]'', performed (by default) by holding the left mouse button or right trigger while the cursor is pointing at a [[block]], or by long-pressing on the block on touch screens. Breaking is the primary way to remove unwanted blocks and acquire blocks for future placement or [[crafting]].

== Basics of breaking ==
{{anchor|reach|Reach}}

By holding down the {{control|destroy}} button while looking at a block within range, the player's hand begins swinging, making a repetitive "thump" sound as the player hits the block. Cracks appear on the block, which show that it is being broken.

{{IN|je}}, this range is 5.2 blocks in [[Creative]] mode, and 4.5 blocks otherwise. {{IN|bedrock}}, the range is 5 blocks when using a keyboard/mouse or controller input; when using touch input, the range is 12 blocks in Creative mode and 6 blocks otherwise.

Targeted blocks are marked with a wireframe cube outline; {{in|bedrock}}, this can be changed to a white highlight by disabling the "Outline Selection" option in video settings. After the cracks completely cover the block, it breaks and depending on the type of block and the [[tool]] used to do so, it may drop an [[item]].

Although many blocks can be harvested with bare hands, certain ones require the use of a [[tool]]. In particular, to obtain resources from stone or metal-type blocks, the player must use a [[pickaxe]]. For harder blocks like [[iron ore]] or [[obsidian]], a pickaxe made from a higher-tier material is required. 

The player can use [[shovel]]s, [[axe]]s and [[hoe]]s to speed up the breaking of dirt-type blocks, wood, and plant-type blocks, respectively. However, tools are not required to get the resource drop (with the exception of [[snow]] and [[snow block]]s, which require a shovel to get a drop). A downside to this is that tools also have [[durability]], so they eventually wear out.

The progress for breaking a block is reset if the target block changes while breaking. Progress is also reset whenever the {{control|breaking}} control is released. The player can move freely while breaking blocks. The player can even dig while jumping, swimming, or riding, although this reduces the breaking speed.

In [[Survival]] mode, however, some blocks are unbreakable, like [[bedrock]], and in [[Adventure]] mode all blocks are unbreakable unless the player has a item/tool with the <code>can_destroy</code> tag. In [[Spectator]] mode a player can't break blocks in any way, and in [[Creative]] mode all blocks are breakable unless the player is holding a [[sword]], [[spear]], [[debug stick]], [[trident]], or [[mace]].

== Mining efficiency ==
{{info needed section|copper speeds}}
The player's mining efficiency (digging speed) is controlled by three factors: the block being broken, the item the player is currently wielding, and the mining penalties affecting the player. Every block has a hardness value, which determines the base amount of breaking time if the player hits it with their bare hands.

The base time in seconds is the block's hardness multiplied by:
* 1.5 if the player can harvest the block with the current tool;
* 5 if the player cannot.

Assuming that the player can harvest the block, the next check is whether the player's tool increases the breaking speed for the block. See [[#Best tools|Best tools]] for a full list.

If the [[tool]] helps, then it increases digging speed by a constant multiplier, given in the following table:

| 2 (5 on [[wool]], 15 on [[cobwebs]] and [[leaves]])
| 1.5 (15 on [[cobweb]]s, 30 on [[bamboo]])
|}

If a proper tool is used, the tool speed is further increased by the [[Efficiency]] enchantment. If the level of Efficiency is not 0, then the level squared plus 1 is added to the tool speed. For example, Efficiency I adds 2 to the value, while Efficiency V adds 26. The speed is also increased by (20×level)% of [[Haste]] {{in|java}} or multiplied by (0.2×level+1)×(1.2<sup>level</sup>) {{in|bedrock}}.

[[Mining Fatigue]] decreases the speed by multiplying by (0.3<sup>min(level,4)</sup>) {{in|java}} or by (0.3<sup>level</sup>)×(0.7<sup>level</sup>) {{in|bedrock}}. {{IN|java}}, increasing the effect level from II to III reduces the mining speed by a factor of 0.03 rather than 0.3.<ref name="MC-279819">{{Bug|MC-279819}}</ref> Therefore, with level III the speed is reduced to 0.0027× of normal speed instead.

If the player's head is underwater and they are not wearing a helmet with the [[Aqua Affinity]] enchantment, breaking a block takes 5 times as long. If the player's feet are not touching the ground, an additional 5x penalty is added; this causes players floating in water to break blocks 25x slower than if they had been standing on land.

The total time to break a block is always a multiple of {{frac|1|20}} of a second, or 1 game tick; any remainder is rounded up to the next tick.

=== Instant breaking ===
{{Main|Instant mining}}

When breaking a block, a tool and its enchantments do its speed value as "damage" to a block every game tick, and when that value exceeds the block's hardness times 30, the block breaks. If the tool and enchantments immediately exceed the hardness times 30, the block breaks with no delay; otherwise a 6 tick ({{frac|3|10}} second) delay occurs before the next block begins to break.
<!--Somehow a golden pickaxe with efficiency V and haste I doesn't break stone instantly in Bedrock Edition, although (12+26)*(1+0.2)=45.6, which is more than 1.5*30, and (1.5*1.5)/((12+26)*(1+0.2)) is approximately 0.049, which is below 0.05-->

For example, a player with [[Haste]] II holding an [[Efficiency]] V [[diamond pickaxe]] (or [[netherite pickaxe]]) can break stone instantly, as the damage is ({{tooltip|8|A diamond pickaxe's base speed}}+{{tooltip|26|The boost from the efficiency enchantment.}})&times;{{tooltip|(1+0.4)|The Haste II multiplier}}=47.6, which is greater than the base hardness of stone (1.5) times 30 (which is 45). Players in [[Creative]] mode always break blocks instantly regardless of tools or status effects, except for when wielding a [[sword]], [[spear]], [[debug stick]], [[trident]] or a [[mace]], in which case the player is unable to break anything.

=== Calculation ===
Combining all of the information above yields the following pseudo-code to calculate how long in seconds a player takes to mine a certain block. All operations are floating-point, not integer.

   if (not hasAquaAffinity):

== Blocks by hardness ==
{{Hatnote|"Hardness" redirects here. Not to be confused with [[Harness]].}}
The following table shows the time it takes to break each type of block. If there is no tool that helps speed up mining that block, the "tool" column is left empty. A few blocks are harvested faster with shears or a sword; these speeds are listed in the last two columns if different than "nothing". Any blocks with a breaking time of 0.05 seconds or less can be broken without the {{frac|3|10}} second (or 6 ticks) delay that occurs between each broken block; see [[#Instant breaking|instant breaking]] above. Any block that has a hardness of infinity ∞ actually has a hardness of -1. However, the breaking ticks start from 0, which means that effectively it can never break.

'''Legend''':
* {{legend|#ffc7ce|incorrect tool, drops nothing}}
* {{legend|#ffffde|correct tool, drops nothing or something other than the block itself}}
* {{legend|#c6efce|correct tool, drops the block itself}}
* ''italicized'' can be [[instant mined]]

<!-- Is this what it means?--> <!--According to a video by AntVenom, -1 is interpreted fundamentally differently from this in the code.-->
<!--can someone please move some of the ones at the top to more fitting places?-->

=== Development ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine||June 14, 2009|link=https://notch.tumblr.com/post/123343045/my-vision-for-survival|[[Notch]] discussed how breaking blocks would work in [[Survival]] mode: "Selecting the pickaxe and clicking on a tile will destroy it, but different tiles will take differently long to remove. Stone will be tougher than dirt, and so. Either way, the delay won't be long. Perhaps one full second for stone."}}
}}

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4|Efficiency enchantment added, which mines blocks faster.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 6|The mining time of many blocks has been decreased, including [[redstone ore]], [[stone bricks]], [[nether bricks]], [[iron bars]], [[door]]s, [[monster spawner]]s and [[obsidian]].
|Before this update, some of these blocks either had no preferred [[tool]] ([[soul sand]], [[fence]]), or a [[pickaxe]] was required, sometimes with [[tier]] requirements, but the breaking time was consistent regardless of tier. For instance, it always took about 5.5 seconds to mine a [[furnace]] with any type of pickaxe. 
|Several blocks' tool weaknesses have been fixed, such as crafting tables now mining faster with an axe and rails now mining faster with a pickaxe.
|Mined stairs of any materials drop a stair block now instead of a block form of its material.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w18a|The 6-tick (3⁄10 second) delay between block breaking is now removed if a block takes less than 1 tick (1⁄20 second) to break in Survival. The player can now [[Instant mining|instantly mine]] a large amount of blocks in Survival simply by holding {{control|destroy}} if conditions are met.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w22a|Mining ores (except gold ore and iron ore) rewards the player with [[experience orb]]s.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w23a|The block breaking animation can be seen when other players break blocks.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w24a|While holding a tool, breaking a block that can be instantly mined by hand no longer reduces the tool's [[durability]].}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4.4|dev=1.4.3|Switching tools resets a block's brokenness.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4.6|dev=12w50a|The Efficiency enchantment no longer applies when mining blocks of the wrong type (ex: Efficiency pickaxes don't increase the mining speed of dirt). This is a consequence of the new rule "the mining speed of a block is increased only when it is mined with the correct tool".}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.5|dev=13w09b|The proper tool now increases the breaking speed of a block even if it is not the correct grade.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.20.5|dev=23w51a|The <code>generic.block_interaction_range</code> attribute now allows the block break reach to be customized.}}
}}

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|pocket alpha}}
|{{HistoryLine||unknown<!--between 0.2.1 and 0.5.0-->|Breaking sounds of blocks drastically changed, from being identical to those of Alpha-esque updates to sounds that were much different depending on if the game was being played on iOS or Android.}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.7.4|Buckets can no longer be used to literally mine water and lava.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-3857}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||v0.12.1|dev=build 12|Breaking sounds are now the same as on PC. Prior to this update, the breaking sounds of most blocks differed greatly on iOS and Android.}}

=== Legacy Console Edition ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|console}}
|{{HistoryLine||xbox=TU5|xbone=CU1|ps3=1.00|psvita=1.00|ps4=1.00|wiiu=patch 1|switch=1.0.1|The mining time of many blocks has been decreased, including [[redstone ore]], [[stone bricks]], [[nether bricks]], [[iron bars]], [[door]]s, [[monster spawner]]s and [[obsidian]].

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Breaking|Mining}}

== Trivia ==
* In the code, unbreakable blocks use a hardness value of -1.
* Mining an ender chest with a wooden pickaxe takes the longest time in the game (16.9 seconds) to mine a block with the correct tool, without the effect of [[Mining Fatigue]] and other mining speed reduction events.
