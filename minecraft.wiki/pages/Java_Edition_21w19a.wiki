'''21w19a''' is the twenty-first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on May 12, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w19a|May 12, 2021}}</ref> which increases the minimum Java version to 16, removes unfinished features ([[bundle]]s, [[candle]]s and [[sculk sensor]]s), and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>mineable/axe</code>, <code>mineable/hoe</code>, <code>mineable/pickaxe</code>, and <code>mineable/shovel</code> block tags.
** Blocks with these tags can be destroyed more quickly with the matching tool.
* Added <code>needs_stone_tool</code>, <code>needs_iron_tool</code>, and <code>needs_diamond_tool</code> block tags.
** If a block requires the correct tool to drop, these tags determine which tier of that tool is required.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Anvil]]s'''
* The maximum length a name of an item can have after being renamed has been increased from 35 characters to 50 characters.

'''[[Candle cake]]s'''
* Renamed from "[Color] Candle Cake" to "Cake with [Color] Candle".

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Bee]]'''
* Can now pollinate [[cave vines]].

'''[[Squid]] and [[glow squid]]'''
* [[Lead]]s now work with them again.

=== Items ===
'''[[Hanging roots]]'''
* Changed the way the item model is displayed in the player's right hand.
* Are now twice as big when dropped as an item entity.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|item}}'''
* New syntax:
** {{cmd|item replace <target> with <item stack> [<count>]}}
*** Same as old version of the command.
** {{cmd|item replace <target> from <nowiki><source></nowiki> [<modifier>]}}
*** Copies item for source to target(s), optionally applying modifier.
** {{cmd|item modify <target> <modifier>}}
*** Modifies item (without copying).

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Removed [[sculk sensor]]s, [[bundle]]s, and [[candle]]s.
** These items can still be accessed through commands.

'''[[Recipe]]s'''
* Removed recipes for [[bundle]]s and [[candle]]s.
* Grouped the recipes for crafting copper ingots from a block of copper with other recipes for copper ingots.

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Changed the splash "Now Java 8!" to "Now Java 16!"

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added cave vines to the <code>bee_growables</code> block tag.
* Removed moss blocks from the <code>lush_ground_replaceable</code> block tag.
* Added azaleas and flowering azaleas to the <code>saplings</code> block and item tags.

'''Technical'''
* Java requirement changed from version 8 to version 16.

=== Experimental ===
Changes have been made to the official Caves & Cliffs world generation preview data pack, which gives early access to the world generation coming in [[Java Edition 1.18]].

'''Recipes'''
* Unhid the recipe to craft bundles and candles.
