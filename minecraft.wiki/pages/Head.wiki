[[File:All The Heads.png|thumb|All heads and skulls.]]
'''Heads''' (including '''skulls''') are a group of 7  [[block]]s based on the heads of [[player]]s and 6 different [[mob]]s. All heads can be [[worn]] as [[helmet]]s and serve as special [[note block]] instruments.

== Variants ==
There are seven types of entity heads:

* {{ItemLink|Skeleton Skull}}
* {{ItemLink|Wither Skeleton Skull}}
* {{ItemLink|Zombie Head}}
* {{ItemLink|Player Head}}
* {{ItemLink|Creeper Head}}
* {{ItemLink|Piglin Head}}
* {{ItemLink|Dragon Head}}

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
The following heads drop when the corresponding mob is killed by a [[charged creeper]]'s explosion:
* {{ItemLink|Skeleton skull}}
* {{ItemLink|Zombie head}}
* {{ItemLink|Creeper head}}
* {{ItemLink|Piglin head}}
* {{ItemLink|Wither skeleton skull}}

[[Dragon head]]s and [[player head]]s have their corresponding mobs, but they don't drop when these mobs are killed by the charged creeper.<ref>{{bug|MC-132933||Inconsistency: Player, Ender Dragon, and Wither don't drop their heads when killed by charged creeper|WAI}}</ref>

If multiple mobs are killed by the explosion of a single charged creeper, only one head will drop from a mob randomly chosen from those killed in this explosion.{{only|je}}

A [[wither skeleton]] sometimes drops a {{ItemLink|wither skeleton skull}} when killed.

=== Natural generation ===
* {{ItemLink|Skeleton skull}}s generate as part of [[ancient cities]].
* A single {{ItemLink|dragon head}} generates at the front of [[End ship]]s.

=== Player head ===
The {{ItemLink|Player Head}} is unobtainable in [[Survival]], and can be obtained only by the [[Creative inventory]], using {{Control|pick block}} or executing [[commands]].

== Usage ==
Heads can be destroyed by [[fluid]]s.
=== Decoration ===
Heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to [[sign]]s. They can be placed on top of or beside each other by shift-clicking.

When placed and powered by redstone, the piglin and dragon heads play an animation. The piglin head flaps its ears (2 times per second for the right ear and 2.5 times per second for the left ear) while the dragon head opens and closes its mouth repeatedly (2 times per second). The same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or [[armor stand]] (note: the animation does not play if the <code>NoGravity</code> tag is set to 1).

=== Wearing ===
The player can wear heads, similarly to [[carved pumpkin]]s or [[helmet]]s. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

Wearing the corresponding head reduces the detection range for [[skeleton]]s (but not [[wither skeleton]]s), [[creeper]]s, [[zombie]]s, and [[piglin]]s to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from [[sneaking]] and from the [[Invisibility]] status effect.

Wearing any head hides the player's waypoint on the [[locator bar]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, wearing any head makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]].

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

Dispensers can place wither skeleton skulls to complete the construction of a wither unless the [[difficulty]] is set to peaceful.

=== Enchantments ===
Heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an [[anvil]].

|-
|}

=== Note blocks ===
Placing a head above a [[note block]] causes the note block to play the corresponding mob's {{cd|ambient}} sound when activated. The only exception is the creeper head; as creepers don't make {{cd|ambient}} sounds, the note block plays the {{cd|primed}} (hissing) sound instead.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.

==Issues==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Heads do not have their own textures and take their textures from other objects.
* When [[breaking]] any head, the particle effect of breaking it is the same as [[soul sand]].
* Despite there being a default Steve head, heads for the other default skins cannot be obtained without using custom names.
* {{IN|be}}, the skull variant for the item is stored under the {{cd|damage}} component, normally used for items with [[durability]].
