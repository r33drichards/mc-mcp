'''Shaders''' are used to define the game's rendering of certain elements.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
{{in|je}}, two distinct kinds of shaders are used: '''core shaders''' and '''post-processing shaders'''. '''Core shaders''' are used to render fundamental parts of the game such as entities and terrain, while '''post-processing shaders''' are used to apply visual effects to the screen after core shaders have ran.

Examples of post-processing shaders include the menu background blur, [[Spectator#Mob view|certain mob vision types]] as seen in [[spectator]], the ''Fabulous!'' [[graphics setting]]'s fixed handling of translucent object, and the [[glowing]] status effect.

Shaders are written in the [https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)]. Each shader program{{note|A collection of shaders which run together.}} comes in two parts, the '''vertex''' and '''fragment''' shader. Vertex shaders define the positions of individual vertices, whereas fragment shaders define the final color of a single render fragment. For example, vertex shaders are often used to create waving foliage and water, and fragment shaders can be used to add effects like bloom, god rays, and blur. In ''Minecraft'', vertex shaders must use the extension {{code|.vsh}}, and fragment shaders {{code|.fsh}}.

Shader programs are stored in the {{code|assets/minecraft/shaders}} directory of [[client.jar]], and can be replaced with a [[resource pack]]. Note that if any error occurs when loading the shaders, the resource pack is disabled and fabulous graphics mode is turned off.

=== Core shaders ===
{{Warning|section=1|Although core shaders can be replaced with a [[resource pack]], this isn't an intended or supported feature and may change at any time.}}

Core shaders are used to render almost everything in the game, including terrain, entities, gui elements, etc. The shader programs for core shaders are located in the <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/core</code> directory of a resourcepack.

Some objects are not drawn using shaders, this includes:
* The sky in the nether and bottom half of the overworld. These are the opengl clear color which is set to the same value as the <code>FogColor</code> uniform

==== List of core shaders ====
A list of all core shaders can be found by expanding the header below, listing descriptions of what each shader is responsible for, as well as what uniforms, samplers, and define directives are available to each shader.

=== Include shaders ===
Include shaders (stored in <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/include</code>) contain helper functions and variables that can be used in multiple shader programs. These must have the <code>.glsl</code>, <code>.vsh</code>, or <code>.fsh</code> file extensions.

To import an include shader, add one of the following import directives anywhere in a vertex or fragment shader program
* <code>#moj_import <filepath.glsl></code> imports a file from <code>assets/minecraft/shaders/include/<filepath>.glsl</code>
* <code>#moj_import <namespace:path.glsl></code> imports a file from <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/include/<path>.glsl</code>
* <code>#moj_import "filepath.glsl"</code> imports a file from <code>assets/minecraft/shaders/core/<filepath>.glsl</code>

When importing an include shader, the game replaces the import directive with the contents of the include shader. ''The imported file needs to end with an empty line, otherwise the shader does not load.''

;Vanilla include shaders
The following include shaders are used throughout the vanilla resource pack
{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Description
|-
| fog.glsl
| Contains the <code>linear_fog</code> function to calculate the color based on the vertex distance. Contains a definition of the <code>Fog</code> uniform block
|-
| light.glsl
| Contains the <code>minecraft_mix_light</code> function, used to calculate face lighting in entity shaders. Contains a definition of the <code>Lighting</code> uniform block
|-
| matrix.glsl
| Contains the <code>mat2_rotate_z</code> function that returns the rotation matrix for a vec2 around the z-axis.
|-
| projection.glsl
| Contains the <code>projection_from_position</code> function. Contains a definition of the <code>Projection</code> uniform block
|-
| globals.glsl
| Contains a definition of the <code>Globals</code> uniform block.
|-

|-
| smooth_lighting.glsl {{upcoming|je 26.1}}
| Contains the <code>minecraft_sample_lightmap</code> function, used by various shaders to sample the lightmap texture.
|}

=== Post-processing effects ===
As mentioned previously, post-processing effects are used in menu backgrounds, when spectating certain mobs to create vision effects, the Fabulous! graphics setting, and when rendering the [[glowing]] effect.

==== Post-effect file format ====
Post-processing effects are made up of multiple passes and render targets. A target is a buffer that can be read from and written to. The game provides some built-in targets that contain certain parts of the game world (particles, water, etc), and you can define your own to read and write data to. A pass can have multiple inputs from png textures or render targets.

Post-processing effects are defined in <code>assets/<namespace>/post_effect/<post effect>.json</code>. ''Note that post-processing effects are applied before the HUD and GUI elements are rendered''

==== GUI item and entity rendering ====
When the game draws an item or entity in a GUI the following process occurs:
* The item or entity is pre-rendered to an internal texture. For items, this may be an atlas of all currently visible items ("GUI items atlas") or a single texture for that item. This depends on if the <code>oversized_in_gui</code> field is set to true or false in the [[items model definition]]. For entities, each one always has a unique texture that it gets rendered to
* For each item or entity, a quad is drawn to the screen which samples from either the GUI items atlas or individual texture for the corresponding item or entity
The game can skip rendering an item when neccesary and will use whatever was drawn on the previous frame. An item is only re-rendered if one of the following conditions is met:
* The item has an animated texture somewhere on its model
* The item has an enchantment glint
* The GUI items atlas fills up, in this case it is cleared and all currently visible GUI items are redrawn
* The GUI scale is changed, in this case the GUI items atlas is cleared and all currently visible GUI items are redrawn
* The item data is changed in a way that would cause a visual update. This includes but is not limited to: changing the <code>item_model</code>, <code>custom_model_data</code>, or <code>profile</code> [[Data component format|data components]]

=== Vanilla uniform blocks ===
<!-- DO NOT reorder the individual uniforms, the order is important -->
{{Warning|section=1|Using uniform blocks outside supported shaders may work in some cases, however this is undefined behavior and may cause unexpected results or crashes. Refer to [[#List of core shaders|the list of core shaders]] for more info}}

Uniforms blocks use the [https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321552624/downloads/0321552628_AppL.pdf std140 layout]. All uniforms must be specified and in the correct order and with the correct type, otherwise weird and undefined behavior will occur. For convenience, some uniform blocks are pre-defined in include shaders, see the [[#Include_shaders|include shaders]] section for more information.

Some shaders may not use all uniforms in a given uniform block, in this case the unused uniforms will have a 'default' value. For example, while the <code>rendertype_lines</code> core shader will have the proper value for the <code>LineWidth</code> uniform, other shaders will have a "default value" for which will likely not be useful.

==== Common blocks ====
The following uniform blocks are available in both post-processing and core shaders.

;<code>Globals</code>
This uniform block is always bound and has proper values in all shaders.
* (ivec3) <code>CameraBlockPos</code> Block position of the camera in world-space coordinates.
* (vec3) <code>CameraOffset</code> Fractional position of the camera in world-space coordinates.

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
{{Expand section}}

Since [[Bedrock Edition 1.18.30]], third-party shader in resource packs are no longer supported on all devices due to the implementation of [[RenderDragon]]. 

=== Deferred rendering pipeline ===

The deferred rendering pipeline is an alternative rendering pipeline which can be customized via resource packs and is used in the vanilla game for the [[Vibrant Visuals]] graphics mode.

Although it doesn't directly support custom shaders, it offers ways to define properties about light, fog, atmosphere, and PBR texture materials. This can be used to create lighting effects similar to those seen in Java Edition's [[shader pack]]s.
