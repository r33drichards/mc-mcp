'''Nether bricks''' are the building blocks of [[Nether fortress]]es in [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Nether bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Nether Bricks|link=none|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
Nether bricks form the walls and supporting pillars of all [[Nether fortress]]es.

=== Crafting ===

|foot=1
}}

== Usage ==
Nether bricks are non-flammable and immune to [[ghast fireball]]s, making them a suitable shelter material for the Nether.

If a Nether bricks block is inside the whole bounding box of a [[Nether fortress]] (not just inside the individual parts), Nether fortress mobs (such as [[blaze]]s and [[wither skeleton]]s) can spawn on it if other normal conditions are met.
