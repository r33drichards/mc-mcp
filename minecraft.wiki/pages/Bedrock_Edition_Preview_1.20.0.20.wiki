=== Mobs ===
'''[[Sniffer]]'''
* Now available without the "Sniffer" experimental toggle.
* Now spawns an [[sniffer egg]] when bred, instead of producing a snifflet.
* Now you can also find the [[pitcher pod]]s of the [[pitcher plant]].

=== Technical ===
'''[[JSON]]'''
* Custom items using JSON formats 1.16.100 and formats past 1.17.0 can be loaded without the "Holiday Creator Features" toggle if there are no holiday components used.
* The {{cd|minecraft:friction}} component is no longer ignored when calculating ground friction.
* Items with the entity placer item component will now successfully create the actor on air blocks if the {{cd|dispense_on}} field is empty.
* Items with the entity placer item component can now be used on a [[monster spawner]] to change the spawner's actor spawn type. The item must have a format version of at least 1.19.80.
* Removed the non-functional {{cd|on_repaired}} parameter from the {{cd|minecraft:repairable}} item component.

'''[[Molang]]'''
* There is now a limit on the amount of nested sub-expressions each molang expression can have.

'''General'''

** Can parse {{cd|PlacementDirection}} ("{{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}}") {{cd|BlockTrait}} (adds the "{{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}}" {{cd|BlockState}} and {{cd|onPlayerPlace}} setter function).
** Can access the {{cd|minecraft:cardinal_direction}} state on blocks that apply the {{cd|placement_direction}} trait in {{cd|block_property}} molang queries and {{cd|set_block_property}} event responses.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
