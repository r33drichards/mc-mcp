The '''vote update capes''' were a list of capes released as part of the [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b|23w13a_or_b]] April Fools update on April 1, 2023, and can be obtained through voting. These capes are exclusive to this version and are not assigned to any player's account. Unlike real capes, none of these capes override [[elytra]] textures.

The word "cape" is intentionally misspelled as "caep" in the game files and in the vote.
