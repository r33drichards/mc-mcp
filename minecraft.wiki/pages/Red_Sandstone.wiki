'''Red sandstone''' is a variant of [[sandstone]]. It comes in three other variants: [[cut red sandstone]], [[chiseled red sandstone]], and [[smooth red sandstone]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break red sandstone is [[pickaxe]]. Red sandstone needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Red Sandstone|Pickaxe|Wood|link=none}}
Red sandstone drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Red sandstone generates at [[Cave#Noise caves|noise cave]] entrances in [[badlands]] biomes.

If a village generates some buildings inside of a badlands biome, any floating platform surrounding village buildings generate with red sandstone below red sand.
