'''Golden leggings''' are a variant of [[leggings]] crafted from [[gold ingot]]s. They are the sixth-highest [[tier]] of leggings, having higher armor points and durability than [[leather pants]]. Like all [[golden armor]], [[piglin]]s are attracted to golden leggings, and do not attack any player wearing them.

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], and [[piglin]]s have a small chance to spawn wearing armor, which may include golden leggings. There is a 8.5% chance (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III) for the mob to drop the leggings they're wearing upon death unless they are spawned from an [[Ominous Trial Spawner|ominous trial spawner]]. The dropped leggings are usually badly damaged, and may be [[enchanted]] with enchantment levels 5-19.

== Usage ==
When worn, golden leggings provide {{armor|3}} [[armor points]]. <br>

=== Piglins ===
As with other pieces of gold armor, [[piglins]] do not attack players wearing golden leggings unless provoked or attacked.

Piglins are also attracted towards golden leggings on the ground and equip them after inspecting them.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
Two damaged golden leggings can be combined through [[crafting]] or using the [[grindstone]]. The durability of the used golden leggings are added together, plus an extra 5% durability. Both the crafting table and grindstone methods do not keep the enchantments of either leggings. (except curse enchantments)

Two pair of golden leggings can also be combined in an [[anvil]]. Unlike using a grindstone or crafting, using an anvil preserves the [[enchantments]] on the leggings, but costs [[experience]].

==== Unit repair ====
Golden leggings can also be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[gold ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% the leggings maximum durability, rounded down. This preserves the leggings [[enchantment]]s, but costs [[experience]].

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], leggings, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.
