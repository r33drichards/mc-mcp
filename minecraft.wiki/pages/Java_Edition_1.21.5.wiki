** When {{cd|false}}, [[TNT]] will not explode and cannot be primed by any means.
*** Trying to do so directly, like with a [[flint and steel]], will show a message on the action bar.
*** Powering a TNT block with redstone makes it simply vanish, as does blowing it up with a [[creeper]].
*** A TNT block on [[fire]] can burn up as if it was a [[plank]].
** Default value: {{cd|true}}

'''[[Game tests]]'''
* The Game Tests system is a new integrated system for testing aspects of the game.
* Each test is an asset defining some parameters for how the test gets executed, combined with a saved structure file containing a base setup.
* Generally, the test framework expects to run tests in a separate superflat world.

'''[[Items model definition]]'''

=== Changes ===
==== Command format ====
'''General'''
* Arguments in commands that accept inline values like loot tables, predicates, modifiers, data components, formatted text ({{cmd|loot}}, {{cmd|give}}, {{cmd|tellraw}}, {{cmd|execute if predicate}}, data components in {{cmd|execute if items}}, etc.) have been reverted to accept numbers in place of booleans.

* Text components in commands such as {{cmd|tellraw}} or {{cmd|title}} are now specified with SNBT instead of JSON.
* Text style in the {{cmd|scoreboard}} command when specifying the styled number format is now specified with SNBT instead of JSON.
* The behavior of {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}} commands have changed in how they handle block entity data:
** If the block entity data is not specified, and the existing block has data, the block entity data will be preserved.
** If the block entity data is specified, the block entity data will be set to the specified value.
** To clear the block entity data explicitly, the block entity data must be specified as <code>{}</code>.
** The operation is now successful if either the block state changed or the block entity data changed.

'''{{cmd|bossbar}}, {{cmd|scoreboard}}''', '''and {{cmd|team}}'''
* Text component arguments are now resolved before use in context of entity held in {{cd|@s}}.

'''{{cmd|data}}'''
* Can now create and modify heterogeneous lists transparently.
* Can no longer traverse paths with an empty key (e.g. {{cmd|data get ... foo.''.bar''}})

'''{{cmd|fill}}'''
*  The replace option in the fill command is no longer terminal, and can be followed with additional options.

'''{{cmd|fill}}, {{cmd|clone}}, {{cmd|setblock}}, and {{cmd|place template}}'''
* Accepts a new option: <code>strict</code>.
** If specified, the command will place blocks as-is without triggering block updates and shape updates.
* New syntax for commands to use the new strict option, and more flexible use of replace:
** {{cd|fill|<from> <to> <block> keep}}
** {{cd|fill|<nowiki><from> <to> <block> [replace <filter>] [strict|destroy|hollow|outline]</nowiki>}}
** {{cd|clone|<nowiki>[from <sourceDimension>] <begin> <end> [to <targetDimension>] <destination> [strict] [[replace|masked|filtered <filter>] [force|move|normal]]</nowiki>}}
** {{cd|setblock|<nowiki><pos> <block> [destroy|keep|replace|strict]</nowiki>}}
** {{cd|place template <template> [<pos> [<rotation> [<mirror> [<integrity> [<seed> [strict]]]]]]}}

'''Item slots'''
* The {{cd|horse.saddle}} item slot has been renamed to {{cd|saddle}}, and now supports any entity that can equip a Saddle.
** Driven by the {{cd|equippable}} component.
** Only mobs that normally support saddles will support riding and rendering of the saddle.
** Items in the {{cd|saddle}} slot can apply attribute modifiers as with other equipment.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Any interface with NBT data within the game (SNBT representation, {{cmd|data}}) now supports heterogeneous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type
** Inserting or replacing into a list of a different type with {{cmd|data}} will no longer give an error.
** Inserting into an array type (e.g. <code>[I;1,2,3]</code>) is still type-restricted.
** This means that the 'wrapper' objects previously used to represent heterogeneous lists will no longer be observable by in-game means.
* The NBT file format is unchanged.
** Heterogeneous lists are transformed before storage to bypass NBT constraints.
*** Example transform: <code>['a', {'b':3}]</code> is stored as <code>[{'<nowiki/>':'a'},{'b':3}]</code>.
** Existing external tools will still be able to read NBT files as before, but heterogeneous lists will be displayed in the transformed form.
* No data produced by the game has changed: objects such as Text Components were already producing heterogeneous lists in this form.
* Note: these wrapper objects may never be observed in-game, they are only relevant to developers working with the NBT file or network format directly.

'''[[SNBT]] format'''
* SNBT (textual representation of NBT-like data) has been expanded to accept heterogeneous lists, i.e. ones where elements are not of the same type.
* NBT format is not changed
** If SNBT command argument transforms value to NBT (like arguments of {{cmd|/data}} or {{cmd|/summon}}), lists might be transformed to bypass NBT constraints
*** Example transform: <code>['a', {'b':3}]</code> is stored as <code>[{<nowiki>''</nowiki>:'a'},{'b':3}]</code>
** This transform is not reversed by {{cmd|/data}}
* The text format for describing object-like data in commands (like NBT, text components, predicates, etc.) has been extended.
* SNBT now also supports following operations:
** {{cd|bool(arg)}} - converts argument to boolean.
*** If argument is a boolean value, returns value directly.
*** If argument is a number value, returns true if it is non-zero.
** {{cd|uuid(str)}} - converts string representation of UUID to integer array.
* Implicit infinite float values (like {{Cd|1e1000}}) are now rejected.

* Number Format
** Either whole or fraction parts of a float number can be omitted
*** Examples: {{cd|.1}} and {{cd|1.}} are valid now
** Float numbers now use E notation
*** Example: both {{cd|1.2e3}} and {{cd|1.2E3}}, {{cd|1.2E+3}}, {{cd|12000e-1}} are now a valid way to represent {{cd|1200.0}}
** Integer numbers can now be prefixed with {{cd|0x}} to represent hexadecimal numbers and {{cd|0b}} to represent binary numbers
*** Example: {{cd|0xbad}} (equal to {{cd|2989}}), {{cd|0xCAFE}} (equal to {{cd|51966}}), {{cd|0b101}} (equal to {{cd|5}})
** Integer numbers now can't start with {{cd|0}}
*** Normally (e.g. in Java) it would mean number is in base-8, but this usage is not implemented, to avoid accidental misuse
** Numbers can now contain {{cd|_}} character between sequences of digits (but not at the start or the end of sequence)
*** Example: {{cd|0b10_01}}, {{cd|0xAB_CD}}, {{cd|1_2.3_4__5f}}, {{cd|1_2e3_4}}
** {{cd|NaN}}, {{cd|Inf}} or hexadecimal float representation are NOT supported
** Type suffixes have been extended:
*** Integer type suffixes ({{cd|b}} or {{cd|B}} - byte, {{cd|s}} or {{cd|S}} - short, {{cd|i}} or {{cd|I}} - integer, {{cd|l}} or {{cd|L}}) can now be prefixed with {{cd|s}} (signed) or {{cd|u}} unsigned
*** New suffixes only affect valid range when parsing - values are still stored as signed
**** Example: {{cd|240ub}} is equal to {{cd|-16sb}}, while {{cd|240sb}} does not parse
*** When a suffix is used without {{cd|u}} or {{cd|s}}, it defaults to signed for decimal numbers and unsigned for binary and hexadecimal numbers
*** Note: since {{cd|b}} is also a valid hexadecimal digit, byte sized hexadecimal values can only be written with a signed suffix, like {{cd|0x11ub}} or {{cd|0x11sb}}

* Strings
** Quoted strings can now use escape sequences beyond ', " and \:
*** Unicode escapes:
**** {{cd|\x}} – two digit escape, like {{cd|\x42}}
**** {{cd|\u}} – four digit escape, like {{cd|\u2603}}
**** {{cd|\U}} – eight digit escape, like {{cd|\U00002603}}
**** {{cd|\N{<name>}<nowiki/>}} – named Unicode character, like {{cd|\N{Snowman}<nowiki/>}}
*** Built-in escape sequences:
**** {{cd|\b}} – backspace, Unicode {{cd|\x08}}
**** {{cd|\s}} – space, Unicode {{cd|\x20}}
**** {{cd|\t}} – horizontal tab, Unicode {{cd|\x09}}
**** {{cd|\n}} – linefeed, Unicode {{cd|\u0a}}
**** {{cd|\f}} – form feed, Unicode {{cd|\u0c}}
**** {{cd|\r}} – carriage return, Unicode {{cd|\u0d}}
** Unquoted strings now can’t start with {{cd|0-9}}, {{cd|.}}, {{cd|+}}, {{cd|-}} to avoid accidental collision with numbers

* Number Arrays
** Values in arrays ({{cd|[B;]}}, {{cd|[I;]}}, {{cd|[L;]}}) without a suffix are now assumed to have suffix matching the type of the array

'''Equipment assets'''
* Equipment assets may now define new layer types:

** {{cd|entity/strider/strider_saddle.png}} →&nbsp;{{cd|entity/equipment/strider_saddle/saddle.png}}
* The following textures have been split from their base entity texture to support the use of equipment assets for saddles:

* Equipment layers configured to be <code>dyeable</code> will now show if the <code>dyed_color</code> component is present on the item, even if the item is not in the <code>#dyeable</code> tag.

'''[[Items model definition]]'''
* Select Property
** {{cd|minecraft:component}} 
*** If the selected value comes from a registry and the current datapacks does not provide it, the entry will be silently ignored.
**** In previous snapshot, unrecognized elements caused the whole item model to be ignored.

* Boolean Property
** {{cd|minecraft:component}}
*** New conditional model property has been added to condition item model: {{cd|component}}
*** Uses component predicates (like ones used in item predicates) to match item components.
**** However, instead of encoding them as a map of {{cd|<predicate type>:<predicate value>}}, a single predicate is encoded in two fields.
*** Fields:
**** {{cd|predicate}} – type of component predicate (member of {{cd|minecraft:data_component_predicate_type}} registry)
**** {{cd|value}} – predicate-specific value

'''Loot Functions'''
* {{cd|toggle_tooltips}}
** Now supports any component id in the toggles map.
** Any component specified will be toggled in the {{cd|tooltip_display}} component.

'''Network protocol'''
* The client-bound {{cd|player_chat}} packet now contains an index increasing for every message sent to the client.
** The index starts at 0 when logging in (or is reset by configuration phase and the {{cd|login}} packet).
** For every message, the server should increment this value by 1.
** If this value updates in an unexpected way, the client will disconnect.
** As the protocol requires that every chat packet reaches the client in produced order, the goal is to enable faster detection of missed/reordered chat messages for custom server developers.
* The server-bound {{cd|chat}} and {{cd|chat_command_signed}} packets now contain a checksum byte along with the 'last seen' update.
** This is a simple hash of the 'last seen' signatures which should be reconstructed by the server, allowing quicker detection of de-synchronized state.
** This can be passed as {{cd|0}} to disable the check, for compatibility with protocol translation.

'''[[Particle format]]'''
* The particle type {{cd|tinted_leaves}} now has a parameter:
** {{cd|color}}
*** Tint color, specified either as packed int or list of 4 floats.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Block predicates
** New optional fields have been added to block predicates: {{cd|components}} and {{cd|predicates}}.
** Their functionality and format are identical to the fields {{cd|components}} and {{cd|predicates}} on item predicates, but they operate on block entity components (when present).
*** When present, {{cd|components}} will match exact contents of block entity components.
*** When present, {{cd|predicates}} will match partial contents of block entity components.

* Entity predicates
** A new optional field was added to entity predicate: {{cd|components}}.
*** When present, predicate will match contents of entity components.
*** Format: 
**** Map of component type key to matching component values.
** A new optional field has been added to entity predicates: {{cd|predicates}}.
*** Its functionality and format is identical to the field {{cd|predicates}} on item predicates, but they operate on entity components.
**** When present, {{cd|predicates}} will match partial contents of entity components.
** The following entity sub-predicates have been removed and replaced with combination of {{cd|components}} predicate and variant entity components:
*** {{cd|minecraft:axolotl}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:fox}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:mooshroom}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:rabbit}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:horse}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:llama}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:villager}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:parrot}}

'''[[Recipe]]s'''
* {{cd|crafting_transmute}}
** The result field now supports specifying a count and a components patch to apply to the result.
** The components patch is applied to the final transmuted item.
** The new format is an object with fields:
*** {{cd|id}} – item id
*** {{cd|count}} – positive integer (default: {{cd|1}})
*** {{cd|components}} – a component patch object (default: empty)
*** e.g. <code><nowiki>"result": {"id": "minecraft:stick", "count": 3, "components": {"!minecraft:damage": {}, "minecraft:enchantment_glint_override": {}}}</nowiki></code>
** The field can still be defined as before as an inline item id (e.g. {{cd|"result": "minecraft:stick"}})

*** {{cd|firstperson_lefthand}} and {{cd|thirdperson_lefthand}} transforms are now rendered the same as when held in hand.
** Item Entity
*** When on ground, model size is now taken into account when determining hovering motion.
**** That means that models should never clip into the block below, no matter what size they are.
*** Positioning of items in an item stack on ground now depends on model size and model type.
**** If model depth (Z coordinate) is below 1/16th of a block, item is rendered as flat stack of items.
**** Otherwise model is rendered as a cluster of items offset in all directions around center.
**** Previously, flat stack rendering happened only for models with {{cd|builtin/generated}} parent.

**** Default: {{cd|false}}
** Example usage: {{cd|java -DbundlerMainClass{{=}}"net.minecraft.gametest.Main" -jar server.jar --packs mytestpacks}}

'''[[Shaders]]'''
* Shader program definitions for core shaders and post-processing effects as JSON files have been removed.
* The shader programs themselves are still available and can be overridden.
* The post-processing effects are still configurable as JSON.
* Post-process Effect Definitions
** The field program was replaced with {{cd|vertex_shader}} and {{cd|fragment_shader}}.
*** {{cd|<namespace>:<path>}} will resolve to <code>assets/<namespace>/shaders/<path>.<vsh|fsh></code>.
** {{cd|type}} is now a required field for each {{cd|uniform}}.
*** Possible values are currently {{cd|int}}, {{cd|ivec3}}, {{cd|float}}, {{cd|vec2}}, {{cd|vec3}}, {{cd|vec4}}, {{cd|matrix4x4}}.
** {{cd|values}} in each {{cd|uniform}} is now optional.
*** Leaving it unset is not recommended and is used for runtime configuration of the blur effect.
** Leaving a uniform unspecified results in undefined behavior, the player must specify each one that will be used by the shaders.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added {{cd|cactus_flower}} and {{cd|wildflowers}} to the {{cd|#bee_attractive}}, and {{cd|#flowers}} block tags, and the {{cd|#bee_food}} item tag.

* Removed {{cd|#default_spawns}} and {{cd|#full_moon_spawns}} cat variant tags.

'''[[Text component format]]'''
* Text Components are no longer stored as JSON wrapped by a string.
* The format itself is the same as before, but inlined directly into the outer structure.
* For example, the item component <code>minecraft:custom_name="{"text":"Renamed item"}"</code> will become <code>minecraft:custom_name={text:'Renamed item'}</code>.
* This includes Text Components passed as arguments to commands such as {{cmd|tellraw}} or {{cmd|title}}.
** For example, {{cmd|tellraw @s '{"text":"Hello world"}'}} may become <code>tellraw @s {text:'Hello world'}</code>.
* Note: in the case where Text Components are embedded in [[NBT format|NBT]], no distinction exists between boolean and integer types.
** To pass boolean arguments to translations, the string form must be used.
* For Text Components with the NBT type and interpret set to true, Text Components will be parsed from the given NBT directly rather than converting to string and parsing as JSON.

* Hover Events
** The <code>hoverEvent</code> field has been renamed to <code>hover_event</code>.
** For the <code>show_text</code> action:
*** <code>contents</code> field has been renamed to <code>value</code>.

*** e.g. <code>{action:'open_url',value:'<nowiki>https://minecraft.net</nowiki>'}</code> becomes <code>{action:'open_url',url:'<nowiki>https://minecraft.net</nowiki>'}</code>
** For the <code>run_command</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>command</code>.
*** The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working.
*** It is no longer required that the specified command field has a <code>/</code> prefix.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'run_command',value:'/say Hi'}</code> becomes <code>{action:'run_command',command:'/say Hi'}</code>.
** For the <code>suggest_command</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>command</code>.
*** The click event will no longer parse if the command contains disallowed characters, instead of simply not working.
*** e.g. <code>{action:'suggest_command',value:'/help'}</code> becomes <code>{action:'suggest_command',command:'/help'}</code>
** For the <code>change_page</code> action:
*** The <code>value</code> field has been renamed to <code>page</code>.

*** e.g. <code>{action:'change_page',value:'1'}</code> becomes <code>{action:'change_page',page:1}</code>
** The <code>copy_to_clipboard</code> format is unchanged.

'''Uniform variant selection'''
* Variants that have spawn rules now use uniform approach for selecting.
** Selection process:
*** Every variant field {{cd|spawn_conditions}} that contain a list of entries.
*** Every entry has a condition and an integer priority.
*** Conditions for all variants for given entity type are evaluated for position where entity is being spawned.
*** Entries with priority lower than maximum priority of remaining entries are removed.
*** The game randomly picks one entry out of remaining ones.
*** If no conditions are remaining, variant remains unchanged from default.
** Entry format:
*** {{cd|priority}} – integer
*** {{cd|condition}} – optional structure
**** Fields:
***** {{cd|type}}
***** Additional fields dependent on {{cd|type}}.
**** If field is not present, condition is always true.

* Spawn conditions

*** {{cd|spawn_conditions}} – field described in uniform variant selection above

* Cat variants
** Cat variants can be data-driven by adding entries to {{cd|data/<namespace>/cat_variant/<id>.json}}.
** This feature is experimental.
