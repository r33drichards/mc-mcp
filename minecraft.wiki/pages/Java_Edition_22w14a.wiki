'''22w14a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on April 6, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w14a|April 6, 2022}}</ref> which adds [[mangrove tree]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, [[echo shard]]s, and [[recovery compass]]es, and fixes some bugs related to [[ancient cities]] and [[warden]]s.

== Additions ==

* Randomly spins if not held by a player, the player hasn't died, or when the player is not in the same dimension of the death point.
* Can be crafted with a [[compass]] surrounded by 8 echo shards.

=== World generation ===
'''{{BiomeLink|Mangrove swamp}}'''
* A new swamp [[biome]] with teal water that often generates in warmer clusters, usually next to jungles and deserts.
* Contains mangrove trees, a new type of tree.
** Has an unique shape, with a root system of mangrove roots leading up to a forking trunk and mangrove leaves.
** It has a chance to generate a [[bee nest]].
** Grows from [[mangrove propagule]]s.
* Naturally spawns warm [[frog]]s and [[slime]]s, but there are no sheep, cows, pigs or chickens.

*** {{nbt|list|player}}: a player for which this trigger runs
* Added <code>allay_drop_item_on_block</code> advancement trigger.
** Triggered when an allay drops an item on a block, with following conditions:
*** {{nbt|list|player}}: a player for which this trigger runs
*** {{nbt|compound|location}}: a predicate for the block that the item was dropped on
*** {{nbt|compound|item}}: a predicate for the item that was dropped

=== General ===
'''[[Player.dat format]]'''
* Added a new {{nbt|compound|LastDeathLocation}} field, which contains a {{nbt|string|dimension}} string and a list of three integers representing the block position of the player's last death called {{nbt|int array|pos}}.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added following block tags:
** <code>#dead_bush_may_place_on</code>: {{cd|d=and|#sand|#terracotta|#dirt|mud}}.

** <code>#mangrove_roots_can_grow_through</code>: {{cd|d=and|mud|muddy_mangrove_roots|mangrove_roots}}.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dead bush]]'''
* Can now be placed on [[mud]].

'''[[Mangrove propagule]]'''
* Now correctly grows into mangrove trees instead of oak trees.

'''[[Mud]]'''
* Now can convert into [[clay]] by placing mud above a block which has [[pointed dripstone]] underneath.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Frog]]s'''
* Now actually kill their food, using a base attack strength of 10.

'''[[Warden]]'''
* Now get angry at all mobs that bump into it, not just players.
* Can no longer spawn on [[water]].
* Can now pathfind through [[lava]].
* Shadow is now the appropriate size.

=== World Generation ===
'''[[Ancient city]]'''
* Removed {{cd|d=,|small_portal_statue|intact_horizontal_wall_stairs_upward|top_piece|bottom_piece}} and variant structures because they duplicate existing structures.
* Changed some structures:
** Slightly changed <code>city_center_2</code> blocks around the chest so that vibrations generated there are always detected by the sculk sensor below.
** A missing sculk sensor was added for the redstone lamp in <code>bottom_1</code>.
** Replaced the light blue and blue carpets in <code>ice_box_1</code> with gray carpets, and the [[trapdoor]] there is no longer open by default.
** <code>entrance_path_5</code> is now able to generate.
* Changed the loot found in chests:
** There's now an extra roll of loot for every chest, with one possible loot option being now 1-3 echo shards.
** Replaced the golden carrot in <code>city_center_2</code> chest with a golden apple.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The mangrove swamp is now required to be visited for the "Adventuring Time" advancement.
* Removed field <code>location</code> from triggers {{cd|d=and|location|slept_in_bed|hero_of_the_village|voluntary_exile}}. It was handled exactly the same as <code>player.location</code>.

=== General ===
'''[[Entity format]]'''
* Replaced {{nbt|int|CatType}} field in [[cat]]s' entity format with {{nbt|string|variant}}.
** Accepted type of value is changed from numeric values to strings IDs. (e.g. <code>5</code> -> <code>minecraft:calico</code>)
* There's also have a similar change to [[frog]]s' entity format like the cats' one.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* The special case size-dependent loot drops of [[slime]]s and [[magma cube]]s are now data driven and part of their loot tables, using the new sub-predicate types.
* The loot drops for [[frog]] food are now part of the food's death loot, instead of dropping hard-coded item types.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* {{cd|d=and|player|fishing_hook|lightning_bolt|catType}} fields have been replaced with <code>type_specific</code>.
* <code>type_specific</code> has field {{nbt|string|type}} (one of {{cd|d=or|player|fishing_hook|lightning_bolt|cat}}) and same fields as removed fields.
* Example:
:* Before:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
 "lightning_bolt": {
   "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
 }
</syntaxhighlight>
:* After:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
  "type_specific": {
    "type": "lightning",
    "blocks_set_on_fire": 0
  }
</syntaxhighlight>
* <code>catType</code> has been wrapped to match new format and now uses new cat variant names instead of texture names.
:* Before:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
"catType": "minecraft:textures/entity/cat/british_shorthair.png"
</syntaxhighlight>
:* After:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
 "type_specific": {
    "type": "cat",
    "variant": "minecraft:british"
 }
</syntaxhighlight>
* New <code>type_specific</code> options:
** <code>frog</code> has {{nbt|string|variant}} field matching frog variant ({{cd|d=or|minecraft:warm|minecraft:temperate|minecraft:cold}}).
** <code>slime</code> applies for slimes and magma cubes, has {{nbt|int|Size}} field matching slime size (smallest is 1).

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Mangrove swamp is now part of the {{cd|d=and|#allows_surface_slime_spawns|#has_closer_water_fog|#has_structure/mineshaft|#has_structure/ruined_portal_swamp|#is_overworld|#spawns_warm_variant_frogs|#water_on_map_outlines}} biome tag.
* Removed <code>#ancient_city_center_replaceable</code> block tag, and merged all its contents into the <code>#ancient_city_replaceable</code> block tag.
* Renamed <code>#warden_events_can_listen</code> game event tag to <code>#warden_can_listen</code>, then:
** Removed <code>sculk_sensor_tendrils_clicking</code>.
** Added <code>#shrieker_can_listen</code>.
