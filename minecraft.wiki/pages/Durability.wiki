[[File:Durability bars.png|thumb|Different durability states of an iron pickaxe|width=544x544]]
'''Durability''' is a property that affects [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, and [[armor]]. It restricts the time(s) that the items can be used. The durability bar starts at green, but as the durability decreases, the color gradually turns to yellow, then orange, and finally red. When the durability is empty, the item is about to be destroyed, apart from the [[elytra]], which changes to a broken state in which it is unusable until repaired. Durability may be increased by combining two damaged items in the crafting grid or a [[grindstone]], repairing them with materials in an [[anvil]], or through the [[Mending]] enchantment.

[[Horse armor]] and [[nautilus armor]] do not have durability.

== Interface ==
The remaining durability of any item can be seen by looking at the item's durability bar on the bottom of the item icon in the [[inventory]] and action bar. Unused items do not display a durability bar. As the item's durability decreases, the bar's colored area shortens right to left, changing color from green to red and leaving an empty gray part. When the item has a small number of uses left, the durability bar is represented as empty, due to rounding to the nearest pixel 1-down, until the tool or armor is destroyed.

{{IN|java}}, the numeric durability of the [[player]]'s items can be displayed in-game by pressing {{key|F3}}+{{key|H}}. This enables additional information in the tooltips for items in the player's inventory.

A weapon, tool or piece of armor picked up by a [[mob]] does not decrease in durability;<ref>{{bug|MC-151686||Equipment used by non-player entities don't consume durability}}</ref> it remains the same as when the item was first picked up by the mob. However, a [[helmet]] worn by any [[undead]] mob (except [[husk]]s and [[parched]]) in sunlight has a 50% chance to lose 1 durability for every tick the mob would normally be set on fire, due to the helmet absorbing the mob's damage from burning.<ref>{{bug|MC-3453|||WAI}}</ref> {{IN|java}}, a [[crossbow]] wielded by a [[pillager]] or a [[piglin]] also loses durability and eventually breaks;<ref>{{bug|MC-163960|||WAI}}</ref> this is not the case {{in|bedrock}}.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-67489||Pillager doesn't break their crossbow}}</ref>

Items with the {{cd|minecraft:unbreakable}} component do not deplete their durability or break when used. Their durability is not shown, even with advanced tooltips enabled, though it is retained in the NBT data. Such an item can be acquired using {{command|give @s <''item_name''><nowiki>[unbreakable={}]</nowiki>}}.{{only|java}}

Most items have the same durability in ''Java Edition'' as they do in ''Bedrock Edition'', but due to a bug<ref>{{bug|MCPE-176713}}</ref>, items can be used one extra time in ''Bedrock Edition''.

== Armor durability ==
[[Armor]] durability is based on the armor's type (head, torso, legs, feet) and material (leather, gold, chain mail, copper, iron, diamond, and netherite). Any time the [[player]] takes damage that can be reduced by armor, each piece of armor they are wearing loses 1 durability for every {{hp|4}} of incoming damage (rounded down, but never below 1). 

Armor can reduce damage from the following sources:
*Direct attacks from [[mob]]s and other [[player]]s
**This includes Strength and Weakness status effects or extra damage from enchantments.
*Getting hit with an [[arrow]], [[shulker bullet]], thrown [[trident]], [[egg]], [[snowball]], [[llama spit]], [[fireball]], or [[Wither#Wither skull|wither skull]]
**This includes extra damage from enchantments.
*Laser beam from a [[guardian]] or [[elder guardian]]
*Damage from [[Thorns]] enchantment (as well as [[guardian]]'s spikes)
*Getting struck by [[lightning]]
*Getting hit by a falling [[anvil]] or [[stalactite]]
*Touching a block of [[fire]], [[lava]], [[magma block]] (does not damage netherite armor)
*Touching a [[cactus]], or moving inside [[sweet berry bush]]
*[[Explosion]]s (including [[firework]]s, but deals more than one point of durability)
*Getting hit by or falling into a [[pointed dripstone]] (excludes fall damage which ignores armor)

The following types of damage are '''not''' reduced by ordinary [[armor]] and have no effect on the armor's durability, but some enchantments protect against them:
*Ongoing damage from being on [[fire]]
*[[Suffocating]] inside a [[block]] or due to entity cramming (also includes the [[world border]])
*[[Drowning]] in [[water]] (partially for turtle shells)
*[[Fall damage]] (including [[ender pearl]]s)
*Colliding a block with [[elytra]]
*Magic ([[evoker fangs]], [[dragon's breath]], [[Poison]], [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] and [[Instant Damage]] status effects)
*Being inside of a [[powder snow]] block (except entities wearing leather armor, which prevents freezing damage)

The following types of damage are '''not''' reduced by ordinary [[armor]], even with enchantments such as [[Protection]]:
*Falling into the [[void]] or {{cmd|kill}}
*[[Starvation]]
*[[Warden]]'s ranged sonic attacks
Values in the table below represent the number of points of durability damage this armor can take before it is destroyed.

Note that every time the [[player]] takes [[damage]] that armor is capable of reducing (see [[#Armor durability|above]]), it counts as one point of durability damage for ''every'' worn armor piece. 

The relationship between the durablities for an armor of a given type are as follows: 11:16:15:13 (from top to bottom on a player). This means that for every 16 points of durability a chestplate has, the boots of the same type will have 13 points of durability.

===''[[Bedrock Edition]]''===
When the [[player]] takes fatal [[damage]], the mechanic of the reduction of the armors' durability behaves differently:

{| class="wikitable sortable"

|-

|}

== Tool & weapon durability ==
Some [[tool]]s are not block-breaking tools: this includes [[fishing rod]]s, [[carrots on sticks]], [[flint and steel]], [[warped fungi on sticks]], [[brush]]es, and [[elytra]]. Such tools are no better than bare fists at breaking blocks, but they do not take damage from doing so—they take damage by being used in their own various manners.

For block-breaking tools, a use is counted if a [[player]] completely breaks apart one block or hits a [[mob]]. If a [[block]] is partially broken, this is not counted as a full use. Additional uses can be counted with specific actions performed by the item (e.g. paving dirt by a [[shovel]]).

Weapons with durability take damage from attacks: either a melee hit ([[sword]], [[trident]] and [[mace]]) or a shot/throw ([[bow]], [[crossbow]] and trident).

Items with an [[Unbreaking]] enchantment do not always lose durability when used; for a given enchantment level, the chance of losing durability is 1 in (1+''level''). Such items last on average an extra ''level'' times their original durability.

Some blocks, such as [[short grass]] and [[crops]], break instantly with any tool or an empty hand. This is distinct from blocks which do not naturally break instantly being broken by a tool with high speed. For more information, see [[Breaking#Instant breaking|Breaking § Instant breaking]] and [[Breaking#Blocks by hardness|Breaking § Blocks by hardness]].

== Wolf armor durability ==
{{#lst:Wolf Armor|durability}}

== Combining ==
{{Main|Anvil mechanics#Combining items}}
Tools, weapons, and armors can have their durability combined, by crafting, using a grindstone, or by using an anvil. Crafting or using a grindstone gives the item with the sum of both items' durability added by 5% of the full durability of the item. Anvils give the item with the sum of the durability of both items' added by 12% of the full durability of the item. Tools, weapons, and armors can only be crafted in twos.
