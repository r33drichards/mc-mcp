'''Cracked stone bricks''' are a variant of [[stone bricks]], obtained through smelting and natural generation.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cracked stone bricks can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, they drop nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Cracked Stone Bricks|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Infested blocks ===
Cracked stone bricks can also be obtained by mining its respective [[infested block]] with [[Silk Touch]].

=== Natural generation ===
Cracked stone bricks generate as part of [[stronghold]]s, making up some of the walls, ceilings and floors. Cracked stone bricks can also generate as part of [[ocean ruins]], [[igloo]] basements, [[ruined portal]]s and [[trail ruins]].

=== Smelting ===
{{Smelting

|Cracked Stone Bricks

}}

== Usage ==
As stone bricks offer no real advantage over [[stone]] or [[cobblestone]], their main use is for decoration.

=== Note blocks ===
Cracked stone bricks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Silverfish ===
[[Silverfish]] have the ability to enter and hide in cracked stone bricks, creating an [[infested block]] of the corresponding type.
