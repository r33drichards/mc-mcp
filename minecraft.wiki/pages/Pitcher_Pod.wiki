A '''pitcher pod''' is an ancient<ref> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJ2dzVcOgg</ref> bulbous seed that has a chance to be dropped by [[sniffer]]s when they finish digging. It is the seed of [[pitcher plant]]s.

== Obtaining ==
[[Sniffer]]s occasionally bury their nose in the ground and start digging. Once the sniffer has finished digging, one pitcher pod has a chance to be dropped on the floor as an item.

Sniffers can dig for pitcher pods only in the following blocks:
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
They cannot dig for pitcher pods on [[mycelium]], which is intended.<ref>{{bug|MC-260259||Sniffers cannot dig nor find seeds on mycelium|WAI}}</ref>

=== Breaking ===
Pitcher crop is immediately destroyed when broken.
{{Breaking row|Pitcher Crop|link=none|horizontal=1}}
If the age of pitcher crop doesn't reach 4, it drops 1 pitcher pod when it's destroyed.<br>
If the age of pitcher crop reaches 4, it drops 1 pitcher plant when it's destroyed.

== Usage ==
=== Pitcher crop ===
{{main|Tutorial:Crop farming}}
Pitcher pods can be placed on [[farmland]] by {{ctrl|using}}, where they grow through five stages as a '''pitcher crop'''. Unlike other crops, {{in|java}} [[bee]]s cannot fertilize pitcher crops.

Pitcher crops break if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to [[dirt]] (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

Farmer [[villager]]s can plant pitcher pods, but cannot harvest them once they have fully grown.<ref>{{bug|MC-263382||Villagers can plant torchflower crops and pitcher crops but cannot harvest them once they've fully grown|WAI}}</ref>

Pitcher crops at Age 0 can be trampled, but at Age 1 and above, they cannot be trampled.

=== Feeding ===
Pitcher pods can be used to breed [[chicken]]s and reduce the remaining growth duration of chicks by 10%.

=== Taming ===
Pitcher pods can be used to tame [[parrot]]s.

=== Composting ===
Placing a pitcher pod into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Pitcher crops are destroyed when pushed by [[piston]]s, and cannot be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.
