== Synopsis ==
{{quote|
You're alone in a [[Overworld|strange new world]] full of hidden dangers. With just your bare hands to mine with, you only have minutes to find food and shelter before darkness falls and the [[Monster|monsters]] come looking for you...

This annual celebrates the limitless possibilities of ''Minecraft''. Packed with step-by-step instructions for exciting builds and projects, tips from the experts, including the game's creator [[Markus Persson|Notch]] himself, cool things to make, games to test your brain power and codes to unravel, it's everything ''Minecraft'' fans have been waiting for.

This might just be the one thing good enough to drag them away from their screens this year!
