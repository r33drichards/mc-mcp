A '''cat''' is a [[passive mob]] found in [[village]]s and [[swamp hut]]s. They can be [[tamed]] and used to repel [[creeper]]s and [[phantom]]s.

== Spawning ==

=== Natural spawning ===
{{IN|je}}, cats can [[Mob spawning|spawn]] every 1200 [[Tick|ticks]] (1 minute). A random [[player]] is selected (including spectators) and a random location is chosen 8-32 [[block]]s away from the player horizontally in both directions and ''at the same height''. If that chosen block is less than 2 [[chunk]]s from a village with fewer than 5 cats, or inside a [[swamp hut]], then a cat can spawn.

=== Villages ===
Untamed cats spawn in [[village]]s as long as there are at least five claimed [[bed]]s within 48 blocks and at most four cats within a 97×17×97 box centered around the spawn position. Cats that spawn with the creation of a village do not [[despawn]], however, any additional cats that spawn within a village may despawn. A village cat spawns with a random appearance, although black cats may spawn only during a [[Moon#Phases|full moon]]; which works in both {{JE}}{{verify|Taken directly from java server source code}} and {{BE}}, where 50% of cats are black. The spawning of cats in villages is a separate process from the natural spawning of passive mobs and thus is not affected by the Creature mob cap. In ''Bedrock Edition'', 25% of cats spawn as babies.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a village periodically spawns stray cats to fill a quota of 1 cat per 4 owned beds, up to a maximum of 5 cats for 20 or more owned beds. Only ''owned'' beds (those currently claimed by a villager) are counted for this purpose. All cats within the village boundaries are counted, including baby cats, cats that wander in from outside, and tamed cats owned by a player. If the number of cats found is short of the quota, the village tries to spawn one cat or baby cat within a volume of 17×13×17 blocks centered on the village center, similar to [[iron golems]].

=== Swamp hut ===
One untamed black cat generates alongside a [[witch]] inside [[swamp hut]]s upon [[world generation]]. This cat never despawns. Additional cats can spawn within the hut similarly to witches. {{IN|je}}, any other cats to spawn within the swamp hut (from [[spawn egg]]s and commands without cat type set) always spawn as black. A new cat does not spawn in a hut if there is already a cat within a 16×8×16 block volume.{{only|java}}{{verify|Taken directly from java server source code}}

== Drops ==
=== Adult ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=String|quantity=0-2}}
}}
*{{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.

=== Baby ===
Like other baby animals, killing a baby cat yields no [[item]]s or [[experience]].

== Appearance ==

*[[File:White Cat.png|48px]] [[File:Baby White Cat.png|48px]] White (white with light blue and yellow eyes)

Cats wearing a collar are considered tamed. When a cat is initially tamed, the collar appears red by default. However, {{control|using}} one of the sixteen colored [[dye]]s on the cat by the owner of the cat changes its collar to the corresponding color.

Despite sharing the same [[model]], cats are smaller than [[ocelot]]s.

The cat variant Jellie was chosen by the community from three finalists<ref>{{Tweet|Minecraft|1063522092057067521|Jellie, Zach, and Coco – these are the three final felines that remain in our CAT CONTEST! 😻}}</ref> of an online contest in 2018<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1063522133593260032|Which cat do you want to see added to Minecraft? Cast your vote!|November 16, 2018}}</ref>. Jellie was submitted to the [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/your-cat-could-be-minecraft Cat Contest] by her owner GoodTimesWithScar. Jellie died in January 2024 at the age of 17.<ref>https://youtu.be/FbVZT4es6Bg</ref>

In the default [[resource pack]], a texture file for a tamed gray tabby exists;<ref name="Unused cat texture">[[File:Tamed Gray Tabby Texture.png|64px]]</ref>{{only|bedrock|short=1}} however, it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game.

*[[File:Tamed Gray Tabby Cat with Red Collar.png|48px]] [[File:Tamed Baby Gray Tabby Cat with Red Collar.png|48px]] Gray Tabby (gray and white with light blue eyes)

== Behavior ==
Cats are immune to [[fall damage]], but they still avoid falling off cliffs high enough to normally cause fall damage.

[[Creeper]]s and [[phantom]]s avoid cats, even while pursuing a [[player]], keeping a distance of 6 and 16 blocks away respectively from any cats. However, a creeper that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. Cats hiss at [[phantom]]s that are currently pursuing a player.{{only|java|short=y}}

Cats can see players even if they have the [[Invisibility]] status effect.

Baby cats have a faster movement rate but otherwise have the same behavior as adults.

=== Stray cat ===
A stray cat is an untamed cat. Naturally spawned cats always spawn as stray cats. Unlike untamed [[wolves]], stray cats may despawn naturally. They pursue and attack [[rabbit]]s and baby [[turtle]]s they see within 15 blocks. Similar to [[ocelot]]s, they [[sneak]] and stalk their prey until they are within 4 blocks, then chase it down. Even though they spawn in villages, they don't necessarily remain there; instead, they explore.

Stray cats sprint away from any player within 7 blocks, and actively try to avoid players within 16 blocks. However, they slowly approach a player holding raw [[cod]] or [[salmon]] within 10 blocks, allowing the player to feed and tame it (see {{slink||Taming}} below). If the player turns too quickly or stops holding the fish within 6 blocks, the cat flees and does not attempt to approach the player for a few seconds.

Stray cats can be leashed.

=== Tamed cat ===
[[File:Lime bed cats.png|left|thumb|Cats sitting on a lime bed]]
Unless commanded to sit (see {{slink||Taming}} below), tamed cats do not remain still for long and explore around the player.

A cat not already sitting attempts to get on top of [[chest]]s, the foot part of [[bed]]s, or active [[furnace]]s at the cat's current Y-level within a 4-block-radius square horizontally. Once on top, it often assumes a sitting position without a command from the player. A cat also occasionally attempts to sit on these blocks if the blocks are at ground level. A chest with a cat sitting on top of it becomes unusable unless the cat is commanded to stand.

Cats that sit on their own can be ordered to stand by commanding them to sit and then stand again, or they may get up if the player holds a raw [[fish]] nearby. The cat can also be brought down by removing the [[block]] or pushing it off. A cat does not sit on a block that is obstructed by another block above it. A cat can also be forcibly moved by attacking it, and while fleeing for some time, it sporadically sits and stands before finally staying put.

Like other mobs, cats enter nearby [[boat]]s and moving [[minecart]]s, trapping themselves. A cat in a boat will always ''appear'' standing, but still maintains its sitting/standing status it had when entering the boat, and can still be made to change between "standing" and "sitting" by pressing {{control|use}} on it, despite no visual change. A "sitting" cat released from a boat will then immediately re-assume a sitting position. Similar behavior exists for minecarts.

Tamed cats, like stray cats, can be leashed.

If a player is harmed by a hostile [[mob]] or a harming potion, but not by environmental damage, a cat sitting in proximity to the player stands, moves a few blocks from its sitting location, then resumes sitting.

=== Gifts ===
When the [[player]] sleeps, tamed cats move toward their owner and sleep near them. When the player wakes, their tamed cats also wake. There is a 70% chance for a tamed cat to give the player a gift after they wake up, but only if the [[player]] sleeps at night; if the player sleeps during a thunderstorm during the daytime, or if the tamed cat has been ordered to sit, the player receives no gift. The gift is a dropped [[item]] from the <code>cat_morning_gift.json</code> loot table:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

|}

After a cat gives a gift, both the cat and the gift are located in the general area of the bed the player slept on, including on the other side of walls or floors.

If a player has multiple standing tamed cats in the area, only the tamed cat that sleeps on the player may provide a gift. If all standing tamed cats in the area are prevented from reaching the player (i.e. trapped in minecarts or boats), then {{in|java}} each cat has a 70% chance of providing a gift while {{in|bedrock}} only one cat may give a gift.

{{IN|java}}, in order for a standing tamed cat in a minecart or boat to drop a gift, it must be within a 10-block radius centered on the block above the head of the player's bed.

=== Teleportation ===
Similar to tamed wolves, tamed cats teleport to their owner if they are more than 12 blocks away, except as listed below. It is possible for a tamed cat to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g., under [[ice]]) and be injured or [[suffocate]] as a result.

A cat does ''not'' teleport:
*If the cat has been ordered to sit.
**Exception: The cat is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it does not sit after it teleports). A dramatic example is if a cat sitting outside is struck by [[lightning]], in which case the cat materializes on [[fire]]. This typically kills the cat.
*If the cat is attempting to sit on a chest, bed, or furnace.{{only|BE}}
*If the cat is attempting to lie or is lying on a bed.
*If the cat is in a [[minecart]] or [[boat]].
*If the cat has been attached to a [[fence]] post with a [[lead]].
*If the cat is in an unloaded [[chunk]].
*If none of the [[block]]s on the edge of a 5×5×1 region centered on the player are [[transparent]] blocks with an opaque block below and another transparent block above.
*If the player is in another dimension.
*If the player is in water, the cat teleports to the player when the player leaves the water.
*If the cat is in water, teleportation is unreliable. It may or may not occur.

Cat teleportation is completely silent.<ref>{{bug|MC-166291|resolution=Invalid}}</ref>

=== Taming ===
{{main|Taming}}

[[File:Tamed cat.png|thumb|A sitting tamed black cat]]
Stray cats can be tamed using [[raw cod]] or [[raw salmon]] (see [[#Behavior|Behavior]] for how to approach a cat). Each raw cod or raw salmon has a {{frac|1|3}} chance of taming the cat. Once tamed, cats follow the player who tamed them. They do not despawn, no longer fear the player, and purr or meow frequently. Like [[wolves]], and with the same limits, they can [[#Teleportation|teleport]] to a player who moves 12 blocks away.

The player can order a cat to sit or stand by pressing {{control|use}} on it. If the player is holding a raw cod or salmon when commanding a cat to sit or stand, the fish is given to the cat instead, causing it to enter love mode. Once in love mode, the player can command a cat to sit or stand while holding a fish. Cats also sit on certain things of their own accord (see {{slink||Tamed cat}}).

Using a cat spawn egg on a tamed cat makes the baby automatically be tamed to the parent cat's owner.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}

[[File:Cats and kitten.png|thumb|right|Two cats with a newly bred baby cat]]

When tamed cats are fed a [[raw cod]] or [[Raw Salmon|salmon]], they enter love mode. Breeding creates a baby cat, and the parents cannot breed again for 5 minutes. The baby has the coloring of and belongs to the owner of one of the parents. The color of a baby cat's collar is a mix of the colors of the parents' collars, if it is possible to mix them; otherwise, one of the parents' collars is randomly chosen.

Two sitting cats are unable to breed, but a mobile cat can breed with a sitting cat, in which case the mobile cat's owner also owns the baby.

Baby cats take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} cod or salmon. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.

When breeding 2 cats of separate owners on a multiplayer server, the user who joined first automatically gets the baby.{{verify|Java or Bedrock? Does this contradict 2 sentences ago where the owner of the non-sitting cat gets the baby?}}

=== Healing ===
An injured tamed cat restores {{hp|2|mob=1}} health when fed a raw cod or salmon by its owner. Unlike tamed [[wolves]], a tamed cat's tail is not an indicator of its health.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Tuxedo Cat.png|thumb|width=165x165|A tuxedo cat ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult untamed cat to form a [[jockey]].

{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*The [[Wikipedia:Bicolor cat#Tuxedo|tuxedo cat]] is based on [[Jens Bergensten|Jeb]]'s pet cat, Newton.<ref>{{Tweet|lydiawinters|162557057407520769|Hmmm looks like @jeb_ added his own cat to Minecraft. Notice the similarities?|January 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|jeb|469403596455673856|Once she was my model for the Minecraft cat, and now she's gone. R.I.P Newton :( instagram.com/p/oSqw7LJMDD/|May 22, 2014}}</ref>
*In [[MINECON Earth 2018]], Jeb announced that the community could vote for a 9th cat skin to be added with the rest of the other 8 cat skins.<ref>{{Tweet|GTWScar|1052208794531315713|Why should Jellie be the 9th new cat skin added to Minecraft?

She has helped me through the hardest and darkest times of my life and played Minecraft with me from alpha to today. My hope is that she gives the Minecraft community what she has given me, friendship and love.|November 19, 2018}}</ref> and was added as the Jellie cat in [[Village & Pillage|Village and Pillage]], making the second mob variation that was suggested by the community, the first being "Toast", a [[rabbit]] skin added as a tribute to a user's deceased pet rabbit.
*In real life, cats have been known for their [[Wikipedia:Cat righting reflex|ability to flip upright during a fall]], particularly larger ones; though they still might be injured by landing. This fact is reflected in ''Minecraft'' because they are not damaged by falls.
*In real life, calico cats are almost always female and the few male calicoes that do occur are generally sterile. However, since animals in ''Minecraft'' are genderless, two calico cats can be bred with each other.
=== Cat sounds ===
*Some of the cat sounds are recordings from [[C418]]'s cat who also made the [[ghast]] sounds. This is also why one of the songs that play in [[the Nether]] is called [[Ballad of the Cats]].<ref>{{reddit|sub=IAmA|nbe2h/i_am_the_composer_and_sound_designer_of_minecraft|c37sjyb|Well, to make this story short, my cat has this interesting behaviour of sounding very human if you disturb him while he's sleeping.

**These sounds are of the cat purring and the cat purreowing. C418 wanted to get all of the necessary cat sounds from his cat, but it refused to cooperate. So C418 got some of the other cat sounds from Freesound instead.<ref>{{tweet|C418|164364075097272320|In other news my voice actor refuses to say his lines today.|January 31, 2012|archive=1}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|C418|164074775721947136|My voice actor (cat) finally did some lines (meowed) and I acutally captured it this time|January 30, 2012|archive=1}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|C418|166522516993622016|The only well recorded cat sounds I have are meowing with purring.

*Some of the cat sounds are recordings from [[Samuel Åberg]]'s cat, named Odi.<ref>{{ytl|4XmJPb4Qt5Y|HOW MINECRAFT SOUNDS ARE MADE @ 2:55|Minecraft|August 3, 2024|t=175}}</ref>
**These sounds are of the cat begging for food, the cat eating, and the stray cat meowing.
*The hurt sounds were also used for the [[ocelot]].
