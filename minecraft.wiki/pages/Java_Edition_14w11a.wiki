'''14w11a''' is the seventeenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on March 13, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314091132/https://mojang.com/2014/03/minecraft-snapshot-14w11a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w11b|author=[[Dinnerbone]]|website=Mojang.com}}</ref> which adds [[endermite]]s.

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Endermite Revision 1.png|36px]] [[Endermite]]s'''
* Appearance is similar to a [[silverfish]]'s appearance, except they are purple and emit ender particles.
* Endermen are hostile toward them.
* Sometimes spawn in place of an enderman teleporting away.
* Despawn after 2 minutes.
* Spawn with a 5 percent chance when an [[ender pearl]] lands.
** Model will be changed in [[14w11b|the next snapshot]].<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|444507940800978944|they have a new model for the next snapshot|March 14, 2014}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* Now internally use states instead of metadata.
* Metadata will still be used for a while.
* Block states of the block being looked at are now displayed on the [[debug screen]] - examples: redstone, door.
* Internally, metadata no longer needs to be calculated out of the 4-bit data value, instead, the values of specified properties can now be easily gotten and set.

'''Block models'''
* Converted fence gates, brewing stands.
* Lighting now works with models (most models for some users).

'''Graphics'''
* Dropped items now face the player in all three directions on fast graphics.

'''[[Fence gate]]s'''
* Show two holes in their item icon.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Creeper]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[witch]]es, [[zombie]]s, [[zombie pigmen]]'''
* Now run away from exploding creepers.

'''[[Endermen]]'''
* Walk slightly faster.

'''[[Silverfish]]'''
* Occasionally stop before moving again (similar to most mobs).

'''[[Slime]]'''
* Seem to jump a bit more randomly.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecart]]s'''
* Changed minecart physics.
** Minecarts now go faster and farther.
** Improved collision and position handling.
** Minecarts can derail at corners if going too fast, as well as refuse to go uphill.

'''[[Minecarts with furnaces]]'''
* They now give a much greater boost to other minecarts.
* When powered, they can move on [[Powered Rail|non-powered rail]]s without decelerating.

'''[[Minecart with TNT]]'''
* Explosions no longer stack.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* On the right hand side, a display shows up if you are looking at a block, giving various pieces of information and NBT data about it.
* Looking at a door and redstone shows you the state of the block.
** Door: which way it is facing, if it is open, which half you are looking at, if it is powered, and what side the hinge is.
** Redstone: power direction (up, down, side, none) for all compass directions (north, south, east, west) and power level.
* Not 100% complete, data for a lot of blocks still missing.

== Trivia ==
* 14w11a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* Endermites were said at this time that they "may have something to do with dragon eggs".<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|444176255521681408|I do have an Ultimate Plan™ with endermites, but it will wait. May also include dragon egg but I haven't discussed this with the team yet.|March 13, 2014}}</ref>
