'''Invalid data value cobblestone walls''' are item forms of the [[cobblestone wall]] block with damage values outside of the usual range which cobblestone walls can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value cobblestone walls are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Transmutation ===
[[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation#Door Transmutation|Block transmutation]] with doors can be used to obtain cobblestone walls with metadata 4 and 5, and [[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation#Arrow Transmutation|with arrows]] any metadata from 2 to 15 can be obtained. These blocks can be mined in 14w21b or earlier to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.

For arrow transmutation, the initial block being transmuted must be a non-mossy cobblestone wall, i.e. a cobblestone wall block with metadata value 0. Mossy cobblestone walls cannot be transmuted. Any connections a cobblestone wall has to adjacent blocks are irrelevant, as these are not controlled by metadata.

== History ==
{{info needed section|Wall page says that mossy cobblestone walls don't drop themselves until 12w36a. Does this also apply to extreme DVs?}}
