"Creator" begins with a {{w|music box}} melody that plays the main nine-note melody of the song. There is the sound of a music box being wound up, and after several seconds of more music box notes, the instrument fades out as an accordion-like instrument, strings, and a clarinet overtake it. An electric piano plays the main melody of the song, being joined by an acoustic guitar. Later in the song, an electric guitar takes center-stage, along with an upward key change to the song, with increased drums/percussion. At the end, "Creator" transitions from the acoustic guitar melody back to the music box melody from the beginning.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Jukebox#Usage}}
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "Creator" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If a [[redstone comparator]] is facing a jukebox playing "Creator", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 12.
