'''[[The End]]'''
* Due to a change in the height of the End, end islands are significantly taller. This behavior is not intended.<ref>{{bug|MC-221553}}</ref>
** As a result, [[end spike]]s and the [[ender dragon]] are buried within the main island. [[End cities]] may be missing upper sections, as they might collide with the world height limit.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Increased the max length of wooden pillars and [[Iron Chain|chain]]s.
* [[Glow berries]] can be found in mineshaft [[chest minecart]]s.

'''[[Ore]]s'''
* [[Copper ore]] now generates uniformly between levels 0 and 63.
* Added large [[diamond ore]] blobs, generated same with the range and method of the regular one.
* It was intended for [[iron ore]] blobs to be more common, however this is not the case.<ref>{{bug|MC-222051}}</ref>

'''[[Shipwreck]]s'''
* [[Moss block]]s can be found in supply chests.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Goats and axolotls are now required for "Two by Two".
** Axolotls have always been available for "The Parrots and the Bats" and goats can now be used as well, though no changes were made to the advancement to let this happen.
* The advancement for obtaining diamond armor is now capitalized as "Cover Me with Diamonds", as opposed to "Cover Me With Diamonds".

'''Build limit'''
* The message for letting the player know they are attempting to build beyond the build limit no longer says "blocks" at the end.

'''[[Mob spawning|Spawning]]'''
* Added a new mob cap category, underground water creature.
** Used by axolotls and glow squid.
** Have a cap of 5, are friendly, are not persistent, and despawn at 128 blocks or more from the player.

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Subtitles for waxing, removing wax, and removing oxidation from a [[block of copper]] now display.
** These were introduced in the previous snapshot, but not correctly implemented.<ref>{{bug|MC-219850}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''Code'''
* Unused parts of code (unused static fields and methods) are no longer removed.{{verify}}<!-- Shouldn't it be "Unused parts of code WERE removed"? -->
** Although this does not affect the game itself, it adds more information for [[mod]]ders.

'''[[Material]]s'''
* Removed the coral material.
* Added the moss material.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Changed the <code>bamboo_plantable_on</code> and <code>enderman_holdable</code> block tags to use the <code>dirt</code> tag, removing other mentions of dirt blocks from the tags.
* Added all copper slab and stair variants to the <code>slabs</code> and <code>stairs</code> block and item tags, respectively.
* Added flowering azalea leaves and flowering azaleas to the <code>small_flowers</code> block and item tags.
