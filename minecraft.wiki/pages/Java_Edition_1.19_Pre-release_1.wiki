'''1.19 Pre-release 1''' (known as '''1.19-pre1''' in the launcher) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on May 18, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-19-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 1|May 18, 2022}}</ref> which makes some tweaks and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Sculk sensor]]'''
* Item interaction vibrations are now emitted when player starts or finishes "using" an item with a start and finish state (such as [[bow]]s, [[crossbow]]s, [[goat horn]]s, [[shield]]s, [[food]]).
* Item interaction vibrations are now ignored when [[sneaking]].
* Now activates upon entities being summoned by a [[monster spawner|spawner]].
* Added the following game events that the sculk sensor reacts to, along with corresponding frequency value:
** {{cd|note_block_play}} with a vibration frequency of 6.
** {{cd|instrument_play}} with a vibration frequency of 15.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Cat]]'''
* The ID of the {{cd|british}} cat variant has been renamed to {{cd|british_shorthair}}.

'''[[Endermen]], [[skeleton]]s, and [[wither skeleton]]s'''
* Now spawn from light level 0 to 11 in [[the Nether]], which is wider range than before.

'''[[Iron golem]]'''
* The spawning change introduced in the previous snapshot has been reverted.

'''[[Tadpole]]'''
* No longer drop experience on death.
* May now be tempted with slimeballs.

'''[[Warden]]'''
* Now require a full solid surface on the block they are spawning on.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Custom world generation]]'''
* Dimension types now have two new fields for controlling monster spawns.
** {{nbt|int|monster_spawn_block_light_limit}} is an integer controlling the block light needed to prevent monster spawns.
** {{nbt|int|monster_spawn_light_level}} is an int provider which is evaluated to find a value to compare the current overall brightness with to determine if a monster should be allowed to spawn.

'''[[Mangrove swamp]]'''
* Slightly reduced the number of [[mangrove tree]]s (25 attempts per chunk to place a tree, down from 30).

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The parent advancement of the "It Spreads" advancement is changed from "Adventure" to "Monster Hunter".

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|place}}'''
* Auto-completion is now available for the {{cd|<template>}} argument to {{cmd|place template|link=none}}.

=== General ===
'''Chat'''
* Now, a chat preview is also shown for chat-related commands, such as {{cmd|say}} and {{cmd|msg}}.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Renamed the "Only Show Signed Chat" chat option to "Only Show Secure Chat".
** Also updated its description.
* The description of the FOV effects setting now correctly mentions all gameplay effects rather than only speed effects.

'''{{samp|[[options.txt]]}}'''
* Renamed {{cd|onlyShowSignedChat}} to {{cd|onlyShowSecureChat}}

'''Protocol'''
* Custom servers can now enable or disable chat preview for certain clients by sending a new network packet.

'''[[Realms]]'''
* The message when opening the Realms menu in a snapshot version has been changed from "Your client is outdated and not compatible with Realms. Please update to the most recent version of Minecraft." to "Your client is not compatible with Realms. Please use the most recent version of Minecraft. Realms is not compatible with snapshot versions.". 

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Removed the temporary server property {{cd|test-rainbow-chat}}.

'''Sound'''
* Equipping armor using the inventory now plays a sound.
* Placing items that aren't armor (such as [[pumpkin]]s and [[skull]]s) in the headwear slot now plays a generic equip sound.
* The {{cd|entity.frog.tounge}} sound event is now correctly named as {{cd|entity.frog.tongue}}

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* The {{cd|#default_spawns}} cat variant tag has been updated to contain {{cd|british_shorthair}} instead of {{cd|british}}.
* Added {{cd|d=and|item_interact_start|item_interact_finish}} game events to the {{cd|#ignore_vibrations_sneaking}} game event tag.
* Added {{cd|instrument_play}} game event to the {{cd|d=and|#vibrations|#warden_can_listen}} game event tags.
