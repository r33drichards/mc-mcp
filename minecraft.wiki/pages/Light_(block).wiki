'''Lights''' are [[invisible block]]s, primarily intended for map makers, that can produce any [[light]] level from 0 to 15.

== Obtaining ==
Light blocks cannot be mined, similar to [[air]], and can be targeted only if the player is holding a Light item in the main hand. Light blocks with a light level of 0 are functionally identical to air.

They do not attach to any [[block]], meaning that breaking an adjacent block does not remove the light block. However, they can be broken by replacing them with another block.<ref>{{bug|MC-263398|||WAI}}</ref> The exception is [[water]] (including, {{in|be}}, flowing water), which can occupy the same space as a light block. See [[Waterlogging]] for more information.

{{IN|Java}}, light blocks are available in the [[Creative inventory]]. Across both ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition'', they can also be obtained by using commands such as {{cmd|give}}. {{IN|be}}, specifying the data value from 0 to 15 determines the block's [[light]] level; if the data value is not specified, the light block emits a light level of 0. The command is: {{Cmd|give <target> light_block [amount: int] [data: int (0 - 15)] [components: [[json]]]}}. {{IN|java}}, using {{cmd|give <target> minecraft:light{BlockStateTag:{level:"<int>"}<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} can give a light block with a specific light level and corresponding texture. If the level is below 0, the non-bulb texture is used, and above 15 the level 15 texture. If the block state is not specified or not between 0 and 15, the light block emits a light level of 15.

== Usage ==
[[File:Shown Invisible Blocks.png|thumb|The difference between air (top left) and light (bottom right) when "show invisible blocks" is enabled.]]
[[File:Particle light.png|thumb|A light block with a light level of 9.]]

Each light block has an associated [[light]] level, which can be any value from 0 to 15. In the [[player]]'s [[inventory]], light blocks display their light level in the top-left corner with a unique sprite for each light level.

=== Placement and Interaction ===
Light blocks are mainly used in [[Creative mode]], so the description below mainly applies to that mode.

Light blocks are not visible, and have no hitbox unless the player is holding another light block in their main hand. When the player holds a light block, any placed light block become interactive, displaying a small icon in the center indicating the block's location and current light level. The block icon is a [[particle]], and does not become visible if particles are set to their lowest setting, although the hitbox remains visible and interactive until the light block leaves the player's main hand.

When holding a light block in the main hand, clicking 'use' on a light block that is already placed on the ground causes the light level of the light block to increase by one. If the light level is already 15, it resets to 0. If a light block's level has been modified, it can be copied back into the player's hotbar by using the 'pick block' button while holding another light block. 

In [[Survival mode]], a light block can be placed, however only its hitbox is visible, and the block is not interactive (it does not allow to increase its level). 

In [[Adventure mode]], a light block cannot be placed, and already placed blocks are completely invisible and inaccessible (only the light they produce is visible).

=== Behavior ===
Liquids such as water and lava cannot pass through light blocks unless they are waterlogged (either with the [[debug stick]] or by placing water on either side of the block.) but falling blocks like sand, gravel, and anvils pass through the Light block as if it is air. If a falling block lands on a light block, or another block is placed over it, the light block is destroyed.

Light blocks are detected by [[observer]]s, and {{in|bedrock}} they can be pushed and pulled by [[piston]]s.

=== Light source ===
Since light blocks produce light, their primary use is to illuminate certain areas of the world.
