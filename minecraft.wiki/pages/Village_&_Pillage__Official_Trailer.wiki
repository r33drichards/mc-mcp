'''Village & Pillage''' is the official trailer for the [[Village & Pillage]] update, showcasing many of the new features from a first person perspective.

== Summary ==
The video opens on a shot of the sky, lowering to reveal a first person perspective of [[Alex]] on a path. They greet a [[wandering trader]] tending to two [[trader llama]]s, one a child, all approaching a village in a [[plains]] [[biome]]. A [[wolf]] instigates an encounter with the trader llama; it gets spat on. The scene cuts to a long shot of several [[villager]]s dancing throughout the village, singing a song made up of their distinctive hums, joined by several farm animals. A [[nitwit]] shows off an [[iron sword]] at a [[smithing table]], while another polishes a [[golden pickaxe]] with a [[grindstone]], who Alex appears to wave at. A [[cat]] tries to take a [[raw cod]] from a [[fisherman]] standing beside the grindstone, before a [[cartographer]] peeks out of a [[fence gate]] window and throws several [[map]]s to Alex.

From there the scene cuts again to a group of several nitwits and nitwit children frolicking down a road, before getting chased by a [[pig]] ridden by a child near a building under construction with [[scaffolding]], which a [[chicken]] falls off of. Two other children kick around a [[slime]] like a ball near a fountain. Soon, a [[raid]] occurs as many [[pillager]]s, [[vindicator]]s, and a [[ravager]] emerge and there is much tension as a horn blares. A vindicator swings their axe at Alex, they deflect with a [[shield]] and incapacitates the illager with a [[diamond sword]], which they then toss at another vindicator. The ravager and its pillager rider leap into the air, sending many blocks, items, and chickens flying, before Alex immediately shoots the pillager with a [[crossbow]], causing the ravager to run off to parts unknown. With that, Alex is declared [[Hero of the Village]], and thus the surviving villagers celebrate with [[fireworks]].

== Trivia ==

* The trailer is used to represent the entirety of ''[[Minecraft]]'' on the store page for the Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/minecraft-switch/|title=Minecraft for Nintendo Switch|website=Nintendo Official Site}}</ref>
* The shot of Alex entering the village is used on [[Minecraft.net]] as the icon for planning a visit to [[Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue|''Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue'']].<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us|title=Welcome to the Minecraft Official Site|website=Minecraft.net|archive=0|archive-time=}}</ref>

=== Errors ===
* An item with the shape of [[sugar]], [[gunpowder]], or [[redstone dust]] erroneously colored blue could be seen as a reward given out by [[Hero of the Village]]. This led to rumors of it being an alternative to [[redstone dust]], conjecturally referred to as [[bluestone]].
* Several [[peonies]] can be seen that are only one block tall.
* [[Torch]]es do not give off [[light]].
