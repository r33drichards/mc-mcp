The '''mushroom field shore''' or '''mushroom island shore''' was a technical biome that represented both the [[Beach|shores]] and the [[river]]s of the [[Mushroom Fields|mushroom fields]].

==Description==
The mushroom field shore generated when a river cut through [[Mushroom Fields|mushroom fields]] as well as when it bordered an ocean, unless the ocean was a deep variant, in which case a steep cliff generated instead. The terrain of this biome was much flatter and shallower in elevation, similar to beaches, though it was equal to the mushroom fields in every other way. [[Buried treasure|Buried treasures]] and [[shipwreck]]s generated here{{Only|BE}}.

== Mobs ==
Mushroom field shores used the same mob spawning chances as mushroom fields.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
