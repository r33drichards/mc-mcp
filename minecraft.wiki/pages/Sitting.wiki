'''Sitting''' is a game mechanic used by the player and some mobs under specific circumstances.

== Mechanics ==
=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding#Posture}}
Players and humanoid mobs can enter the sitting-like posture when [[riding]] an entity.

=== Wolves, parrots and cats ===
The player can order a tamed [[wolf]], [[cat]], or [[parrot]] to sit by right-clicking. These mobs stay in place, and do not move or teleport to the player unless they are attacked or the animal is forced to stand.

Wolves and cats inside minecarts or boats do not actually appear sitting.<ref name="BadlyCodedSitting">{{bug|MC-93491}}</ref>

=== Foxes ===
[[Fox]]es occasionally sit down on their own accord. This happens when they cannot find an area to sleep. Sitting happens briefly, and the fox resumes standing within seconds. Foxes also do not permanently sit within vehicles.<ref name="BadlyCodedSitting"/>

=== Pandas ===
[[Panda]]s also sit on their own accord, sometimes to eat bamboo.

=== Camels ===
When [[camel]]s are not being ridden, they sometimes sit down.
