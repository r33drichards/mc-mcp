[[File:Parrying.png|thumb|right|The blocking animation using a sword before and after [[Java Edition 14w30a]] (from the [[Adventure Update|Adventure]] to the [[Bountiful Update|Bountiful]] updates).]]
'''Sword blocking''' was a mechanic {{In|Java}} and [[Legacy Console Edition]] where a [[player]] could use a [[sword]] in their main-hand to block attacks. This mechanic was replaced with [[Blocking|shield blocking]] in [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]].

== Usage ==
All types of swords could be used to block some forms of [[damage]]. If the player was blocking with a sword when attacked, the sword mitigates 50% of incoming damage from melee, non-magical projectiles like arrows, and explosions. Blocking also reduced airborne knockback. When blocking, the sword was held in front of the player, and it did not lose durability while blocking. The player would move slower when blocking with a sword than they did when [[sneaking]]. Sword blocking could be engaged and disengaged instantly, with no delay between the input and the damage mitigation, and no cooldown between stopping and starting sword blocking.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=Pre-release|Added blocking, which at the time could be activated by {{control|using}} a sword. Also, blocking negated only 50% of incoming damage, rather than 100%.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Pre-release 2 ;)|Blocking now correctly reduces damage in [[multiplayer]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease|Blocking now moves the player's hand, unlike previous versions, in which blocking moved just the sword.
|The player no longer rises faster underwater when blocking.
|Blocking no longer decreases fall damage. Blocking previously allowed the player to fall 42 blocks without dying, instead of 22.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w30a|Third person blocking position tweaked.
|Blocking while mining was made impossible.
|Blocking immediately after attacking no longer continues the swing animation.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w33c|The [[File:Blocking Steve (sword).png|32px]] [[File:Blocking Alex (sword).png|32px]] blocking functionality of swords was removed and is replaced with the [[File:Blocking Steve (shield).png|32px]] [[File:Blocking Alex (shield).png|32px]] functionality of [[shield]]s.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.21.2|dev=24w34a|Added <code>block</code> animation in <code>[[Data component format#consumable|minecraft:consumable]]</code> item stack component.}}
