[[File:TexturesComparison.png|thumb|right|350px|The default textures on the left side, and a custom resource pack ([https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/rodrigos-pack/ Rodrigo's Pack 8x8]) on the right.]]
The '''resource pack''' system provides a way for players to customize textures, [[model]]s, [[music]], [[sound]]s, [[language]]s, texts such as the [[End Poem]], [[splash]]es, [[Credit sequence|credits]], and fonts without any code modification. They are often used together with [[data pack]]s or [[behavior pack]]s to add new content to the game. {{IN|BE}}, resource packs are often included in [[add-on]]s in the [[Marketplace]].

== ''Java Edition'' ==
=== Behavior ===
[[File:Select resource pack.png|thumb|The default resource pack settings.]]
Each resource pack is either a directory or a [[w:ZIP (file format)|ZIP archive]] (with {{code|.zip}} extension). Resource packs can be added by placing them in the {{file|directory|resourcepacks|inline=1}} directory within {{file|directory|[[.minecraft]]|inline=1}}, or by dragging and dropping onto the "Select Resource Packs" screen, which copies them there automatically. Resource packs present in the directory can then be managed from the [[options]], where they can be moved between "Available" (disabled) and "Selected" (enabled), and reordered.

Resource packs load their assets based on the order they appear in on the "Selected" list. The bottom-most pack loads first, then each pack above it replaces or merges loaded assets with ones it contains.

==== Built-in resource packs ====
There are currently three resource packs that are included as part of the game.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| [[File:HC pack.png|32px]] High Contrast || Enhances the UI contrast of Minecraft (built-in) || Increases the contrast of menu GUIs.
|}

==== Preloaded resource packs ====
A ZIP archive resource pack can be bundled with a [[world]] by placing it in the world directory under the name {{code|resources.zip}}. When playing the world, that resource pack appears as the default pack, right above the default resource pack. It is, however, not distributed to other players connecting via [[Multiplayer#LAN connections|LAN]].

A resource pack can be set on a server by setting {{code|resource-pack}} to an HTTP(S) URL pointing to a ZIP archive resource pack in [[server.properties]]. Players can then choose if they want to download the resource pack or not when joining. Players can also be forced to accept the resource pack by setting {{code|require-resource-pack{{=}}true}}; in this case, rejecting the resource pack disconnects the player from the server.

There is no way to force the use of a resource pack in a [[Realm]].{{needs testing}}

=== Directory structure ===
Resource packs in ''Java Edition'' have the following directory structure:

<div class="treeview">
*{{File|directory|''name''}} or {{File|archive|''name''.zip}}
**{{File|file|[[pack.mcmeta]]}}: Metadata of the resource pack. This is the only mandatory file.

</div>

=== Contents ===
A resource pack is identified by ''Minecraft'' based on the presence of {{file|file|[[pack.mcmeta]]|inline=1}} in the root directory.

The root directory also contains an optional {{w|PNG}} image called {{file|file|pack.png|inline=1}}, which appears as the thumbnail for the pack on the resource pack selection menu.

==== Language ====
Language files are [[JSON]] files, which contain text data translated to different [[languages]]. They are located in {{file|directory|assets/''[[namespace]]''/lang|inline=1}} and named {{file|file|''language code''.json|inline=1}}. Languages other than default can be defined in {{file|file|pack.mcmeta|inline=1}}.

<div class="treeview">
* {{Nbt|compound}} The root object.
** {{Nbt|string|''ID''}}: Displayed translation for the text ''ID''.
</div>

A language file consists of an object containing ID and translation pairs. The ID uniquely identifies any translatable text in the game, and the translation is displayed as that text when the language is selected. For example, {{code|block.minecraft.stone}} is the ID of the text used for the name of the [[stone]] block, and its translation in the {{code|en_us}} language is {{code|Stone}}.

Language files are merged with other selected packs, so any names that are not present are loaded from packs of lesser priority.

In language key values, placeholders to be replaced by other text or numbers later can also be used; for example, using the {{code|with}} of a [[Text component format#Translated Text|translatable text component]].

Placeholders are defined using {{code|%s}} as a short form, or {{code|%''<number>''$s}} to specify the index explicitly. Placeholder indices start at {{code|1}}. When not specifying the index explicitly, the game will pick the next available index in sequential order, and placeholders are assigned an index in the order they are encountered in the string. If translators need to swap the order of placeholders for grammatical reasons, they can swap a {{code|%s}} placeholder with an indexed one.

A literal {{code|%}} character, which should render as such in the text shown by the game and is not part of a translation placeholder, must be escaped by using {{code|%%}}; otherwise, the game may fail to parse other placeholders within that string.

==== Textures ====
[[File:Missing Model.png|thumb|The "missing model" for invalid or missing models, prominently using the black and magenta "missing texture".]]

Textures are image files in PNG format, which provide images to be used as textures for models such as items, blocks and mobs.

Before 1.13 for block or item textures to function, they must have equal width and height (or height that is a multiple of the width if [[#Texture animation|animated]]); otherwise it appears as a magenta and black checkerboard. For most other textures, the file is stretched to fit the required dimensions. 
As of 1.13 non-square textures can be used for blocks and items just fine (although they will look stretched/squashed on default models).

Most solid blocks turn any transparent area fully opaque. Some other blocks, which have "cutout" transparency (like glass) turn all pixels that are less than 10% opaque fully transparent and all other pixels completely opaque. Every other block renders textures with semi-transparency as-is. All items, blocks or entities that are semi-transparent by default support semi-transparency. All items that do not have a corresponding block do support semi-transparency.

If a texture does not exist in any resource pack, including the default, the [[missing texture]] appears in its place. As of 1.19.1, six such cases exist in the vanilla resource pack, all particle-related.

==== Texture animation ====
All textures that get stitched to an [[atlas]] support animation. This includes:
* Block and item textures
* Banner and shield textures
* Some block entities including: bed, chest, conduit, decorated pot, enchanting table book, bell, shulker box and sign textures
* Item frame and painting textures
* GUI sprites (all textures in the {{file|directory|assets/<namespace>/textures/gui/sprites/|inline=1}} directory)
* Mob effect icon textures
* Map decoration textures
* Particle textures
* Armor trim textures. This doesn't work with the {{code|paletted_permutations}} atlas source type, so textures must be added to the atlas using either the {{code|directory}} or {{code|single}} source types to be animated
* Sun, moon, and end flash

An animated texture is created by placing additional frames either vertically below the first, or horizontally to the right of the first. Alternatively, the frames can be arranged in a table by defining a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> in the animation properties; in this case they are ordered row by row, top to bottom, left to right.

Each frame of the animation must be the same size, and the total dimensions of the image must be divisible by the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> in the animation properties; otherwise a [[missing texture]] is shown. If a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are not specified, the game assumes each frame is square and the size of the smallest dimension of the image.

The animation properties are specified with a JSON file, named like the texture (including the extension), but with <code>.mcmeta</code> suffix appended. For example, the animation properties for {{code|stone.png}} would be {{code|stone.png.mcmeta}}.

;Texture animation properties format
<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} The root tag 
**{{nbt|compound|animation}}: Contains the animation properties
***{{nbt|boolean|interpolate}}: If true, the game generates additional frames between frames if the <code>frametime</code> is greater than 1 between them. Defaults to {{code|false}}.
***{{nbt|int|width}}: The width of a single frame in pixels. Defaults to the image's width if <code>height</code> is defined, or the smaller of the image's dimensions if it isn't.
***{{nbt|int|height}}: The height of a single frame, in pixels. Defaults to the image's height if <code>width</code> is defined, or the smaller of the image's dimensions if it isn't.
***{{nbt|int|frametime}}: Sets the default time for each frame in increments of one game tick. Defaults to {{code|1}}.
***{{nbt|list|frames}}: Contains a list of frames. Defaults to displaying all the frames from first to last.
****{{nbt|int}} The index of a frame, with the first frame being <code>0</code>.
****{{nbt|compound}} An object containing additional data about a frame
*****{{nbt|int|index}}: The index of a frame, with the first frame being <code>0</code>.
*****{{nbt|int|time}}: The time in ticks to show this frame, overriding <code>frametime</code> above.
</div>

If the animation properties file does not exist in the pack and the texture does, the game assumes it isn't animated and displays the entire texture at once.

==== Villagers ====
Textures from {{code|assets/minecraft/textures/entity/villager}} and {{code|assets/minecraft/textures/entity/zombie_villager}} support a {{code|.mcmeta}} file in JSON format containing additional effects to apply to the hat layer. The file is contained in the same directory as the texture, and has the same name as the texture, except appended with {{code|.mcmeta}}. For example, the file {{code|profession/farmer.png}} can have a properties file called {{code|profession/farmer.png.mcmeta}}

<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} The root tag 
**{{nbt|compound|villager}}: Contains data for the texture
***{{nbt|string|hat}}: Can be {{code|full}}, {{code|partial}}, or default (no {{code|.mcmeta}} file). Determines whether the villager's 'profession' hat layer should allow the 'type' hat layer to render or not. Can also be set to {{code|full}} on the 'type' hat layer to not render the aforementioned hat layer if the 'profession' hat layer is set to {{code|partial}}. Setting the 'type' hat layer to {{code|partial}} is ignored.
</div>

If the {{code|.mcmeta}} file does not exist in the pack and the texture does, the game loads the default settings, rather than loading a {{code|.mcmeta}} file from a pack below that pack.

==== GUI ==== 
Textures from {{code|assets/minecraft/textures/gui/sprites}} support a {{code|.mcmeta}} file in JSON format containing scaling behavior of the texture. For example, the file {{code|button.png}} can have a properties file called {{code|button.png.mcmeta}}

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag 
** {{nbt|compound|gui}}: Contains data for the texture
*** {{nbt|compound|scaling}}: Scaling behavior of the texture.
**** {{nbt|string|type}}: Can be {{code|stretch}} (default), {{code|tile}}, or {{code|nine_slice}}. Determines the type of scaling method of the texture. 
***** When {{Code|tile}}, the sprite is repeated across the desired space, starting from the top-left.
***** When {{Code|nine_slice}}, the sprite is sliced into ''4 corners'', ''4 edges'', and ''1 center slice'', which is tiled across the desired space.<ref>snapshot description https://www.minecraft.net/it-it/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w31a</ref>
**** {{nbt|int|width}}: Number of pixels for this sprite to cover on-screen across its width. Required if {{nbt|string|type}} is set to <code>tile</code> or <code>nine_slice</code>.
**** {{nbt|int|height}}: Number of pixels for this sprite to cover on-screen across its height. Required if {{nbt|string|type}} is set to <code>tile</code> or <code>nine_slice</code>.
**** {{nbt|boolean|stretch_inner}}: If true, the inner parts of the texture is stretched instead of tiled. Defaults to {{code|false}}. Required if {{nbt|string|type}} is set to <code>nine_slice</code>.
**** {{nbt|int|border}}: The size in pixels that the border slices should cover on-screen. Required if {{nbt|string|type}} is set to <code>nine_slice</code>.
**** {{nbt|compound|border}}: The size in pixels that the border slices should cover on-screen, respectively. Required if {{nbt|string|type}} is set to <code>nine_slice</code>.
***** {{nbt|int|left}}: Number of pixels of the left border.
***** {{nbt|int|top}}: Number of pixels of the top border.
***** {{nbt|int|right}}: Number of pixels of the right border.
***** {{nbt|int|bottom}}: Number of pixels of the bottom border.
</div>

==== Colormaps ====
Colormaps are 256×256 pixel images that tell the game which color to use in each biome. They are located in {{code|assets/minecraft/textures/colormap}}. The game contains three colormaps: {{code|foliage.png}} colors plants such as [[leaves]] (except birch and spruce) and [[vines]], {{code|grass.png}} colors [[grass]] and [[grass blocks]], and {{code|dry_foliage.png}} colors [[leaf litter]]. Colormaps can be disabled on individual blocks by removing the {{code|tintindex}} tag from the block model.

Birch leaves, spruce leaves, swamp grass, mangrove swamp grass and midlands grass are not controlled by colormaps {{in|JE}}, unlike {{in|BE}}.

==== Properties ====
Textures from {{code|assets/minecraft/textures/misc}}{{verify|are textures elsewhere supported? I tested this for the pause menu background and it seemed to work}} support a {{code|.mcmeta}} file in JSON format containing additional effects to apply to the texture. The file is contained in the same directory as the texture, and has the same name as the texture, except appended with {{code|.mcmeta}}. For example, the file {{code|pumpkinblur.png}} can have a properties file called {{code|pumpkinblur.png.mcmeta}}

<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|compound}} The root tag 
**{{nbt|compound|texture}}: Contains data for the texture
***{{nbt|boolean|blur}}: Causes the texture to blur when viewed from close up. Defaults to {{code|false}}
***{{nbt|boolean|clamp}}: Causes the texture to stretch instead of tiling in cases where it otherwise would, such as on the shadow. Defaults to {{code|false}}
***{{nbt|int-array|mipmaps}}: Custom mipmap values for the texture
</div>

If the {{code|.mcmeta}} file does not exist in the pack and the texture does, the game loads the default settings, rather than loading a {{code|.mcmeta}} file from a pack below that pack.

==== Texts ====
Two text files in UTF-8 format and one JSON file exist in {{file|directory|assets/minecraft/texts|inline=1}}. They are used to display specific untranslated text.

The file {{file|file|end.txt|inline=1}} contains the text of the [[End Poem]], using [[formatting codes]] to apply the colors to the two speakers, and with the text {{code|PLAYERNAME}} being replaced with the player's name. After that file is shown, [[Credit sequence|credits]] based on contents of {{file|file|credits.json|inline=1}} are shown.

The following [[JSON]] format is used for {{file|file|credits.json|inline=1}}:
<div class="treeview">
*{{nbt|list}} The root list
**{{nbt|string|section}}: Title of this section
**{{nbt|list|disciplines}}: List of disciplines in this section
***{{nbt|string|discipline}}: Name of this discipline
***{{nbt|list|titles}}: List of titles(roles) credit given to
****{{nbt|string|title}}: Name of title
****{{nbt|list|names}}: List of people's names in this title
</div>

The file {{file|file|splashes.txt|inline=1}} contains texts separated by LF line breaks used as [[splash]]es.

==== Texture sheets ====
{{main|Texture atlas/Predefined}}
''Minecraft'' generally does not store multiple different textures in combined sheets and instead stores them in separate files. The only current exceptions are [[experience orb]]s.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360058097892-Split-up-the-experience-orb-texture-file-into-individual-sprites</ref>

==== Regional compliancies warnings ====
Regional compliancies warnings can be customized in {{file|file|assets/''[[namespace]]''/regional_compliancies.json|inline=1}}.

<div class="treeview"> 
*{{nbt|compound}} The root tag
**{{nbt|list|''Region''}}: Contains a list of warnings. Note that the key itself is an {{wikipedia|ISO 3166-1 alpha-3}} region code determined by the device's locale setting.  
***{{nbt|compound}} An individual warning message
****{{nbt|int|delay}}: Optional. Defines how long should the game wait until showing this message in minutes. This can not be zero.
****{{nbt|int|period}}: The time interval this message should be shown in minutes. This can not be zero.
****{{nbt|string|title}}: The translation identifier of the title of the message. A slot is provided for the translation string, containing how many times this warning has been shown.
****{{nbt|string|message}}: The translation identifier of the message. A slot is provided for the translation string, how many times this warning has been shown.
</div>

The game includes a compliancy warning for South Korea (<code>KOR</code>) about excessive playing, shown every hour and telling the exact number of hours the game is open for. An additional warning is shown if the game is open for a day or more.

=== Default resource pack ===
The default resource pack is special, as it does not exist in the same form as other resource packs. It combines assets from two sources: the {{File|directory|assets|inline=1}} directory in [[client.jar]] and the asset object store.

The default resource pack also provides the other built-in resource packs, as regular resource pack ZIP files.

==== Asset object store ====
The asset object store is a system used to efficiently download, store and retrieve assets across multiple versions. It resides in {{File|directory|assets|inline=1}} inside the launcher {{File|directory|[[.minecraft]]|inline=1}} directory.

The path to the directory of the store is provided to the game with the <code>--assetsDir</code> command line parameter. The ID of the asset index, describing asset metadata for a specific version, is provided with the <code>--assetIndex</code> command line parameter.

Asset files for all versions are stored inside {{File|directory|objects|inline=1}}, in subdirectories named with two hexadecimal digits (0-f), for example {{File|directory|7f|inline=1}}. The names correspond to the first two digits of the SHA1 hashes of the asset files stored inside. The asset files inside are named with their full SHA1 hash, which is 40 hexadecimal digits (without a filename extension), for example {{File|file|7f7777e5d5b163c5d64201fd53e5682599548a49|inline=1}}.

For the game to find assets, the asset index corresponding to the version is required. Indexes are stored in {{File|directory|indexes|inline=1}}. An index is a [[JSON]] file named {{File|file|''id''.json|inline=true}}, where ''id'' is the index ID. The file structure is as follows:

<div class="treeview">
* {{Nbt|compound|}}: The root object
** {{Nbt|compound|objects}}
*** {{Nbt|compound|''id''}}: Asset (object) data, where ''id'' is the asset ID
**** {{Nbt|string|hash}}: SHA1 hash of the asset, which allows to find the asset in the {{File|directory|objects|inline=1}} directory
**** {{Nbt|double|size}}: Size of the asset, in bytes
</div>

The mapping of versions to asset index IDs is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Version !! Asset index ID
|-
| 1.21.6 || 26
|-
| 1.21.5 || 24
|-
| 1.21.4 || 19
|-
| 1.21.2 || 18
|-
| 1.21 || 17
|-
| 1.20.5 || 16
|-
| 1.20.3 || 12
|-
| 1.20.2 || 8
|-
| 1.20 || 5
|-
| 1.19.3 || 2
|-
| 1.13 || 1.13
|-
| 1.12 || 1.12
|}

=== Behavior ===
[[File:BE Global Resources settings.png|thumb|The global resources tab in the settings.]]
[[File:Ore UI - Create New World Screen Menu "Resource Packs" Tab Settings (Bedrock).png|thumb|The resource packs tab in the Create New World screen.]]
Similarly to [[behavior pack]]s, resource packs can be created and imported {{in|be}}. Users can download external resource packs with the {{cd|.mcpack}} [[File extensions|file extension]], if the game platform allows file importation. When these files are opened, they are automatically imported into the {{code|resource_packs}} directory in {{code|[[com.mojang]]}} without any need for file system access. Resource packs can also be put manually in the {{code|development_resource_packs}} directory. Each resource pack must either be a subdirectory or a {{code|.zip}} file.

Resource packs can be applied locally on the Global Resources option from the [[settings]] menu from the main menu screen. Resource packs can be moved between "Active" and "My Packs". 

One or more resource packs can be bundled with a world from the [[Create New World]] and [[Edit World]] screens. These resource packs will be imported into the world files, and are kept when exporting the world. Players joining a [[multiplayer]] world with resource packs get an option to download the resource pack or not. When "Shared packs" (or {{code|texturepack-required}} in [[server.properties]]) is enabled, all global resources will be ignored and players are forced to download and enable all resource packs stored in the world files. Developmental resource packs cannot be applied to worlds on [[Realms]], but worlds uploaded to Realms or [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]] keep the resource packs applied to the world.

In Bedrock Dedicated Server, resource packs also can be stored outside of worlds. Packs need to be enabled in the {{Cd|world_resource_packs.json}} file in a world file. 

Resource packs load their assets based on the order of the packs on the list. The bottom-most pack loads first, then each pack placed above it replaces assets of the same name with its assets. Global resources are always applied above world resource packs.

Resource packs cannot be edited unless put into the {{code|development_resource_packs}} directory, and will update themselves when joining a world or changing active resource packs.

==== Settings ====
Resource packs can contain custom settings that affect features in the pack.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/addons/custompacksettings?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Creating a Pack with Custom Settings|website=Microsoft Learn|date=August 1, 2025}}</ref> Settings need to be specified in {{Cd|[[manifest.json]]}}, with the options to create an on/off toggle, or a slider with specific values. The settings menu for custom and Marketplace resource packs can be opened with a button next to the pack button in the edit world screen to change settings for the whole world, or in the pack description in the global resources settings to change settings locally. Custom labels for each setting can be applied, which support text [[Formatting codes|formatting]].

Custom settings currently can't affect any features in the resource pack, but Mojang Studios plans to create a [[Molang]] query function for this purpose.

The settings menu can also be used to change the memory tier, which affects the [[Add-on#Sub-packs|sub-packs]] being used.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/buildingsubpacks?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Building Sub-Packs|website=Microsoft Learn|date=August 28, 2025}}</ref> The memory tier can be set to any specified value from the device's memory tier and lower. Sub-packs are resource packs within the root of the behavior pack, with the same directory structure. They can be added to the pack in {{Cd|manifest.json}}.

==== Marketplace resource packs ====
[[Add-ons]] and worlds from the [[Marketplace]] often contain or consist entirely of a resource pack. These packs are stored internally and can't be accessed from {{code|[[com.mojang]]}}. Players can only access Marketplace resource packs or play on worlds with resource packs applied when they own the pack, by purchasing it in the Marketplace or by owning the [[Marketplace Pass]]. Which packs a player owns is stored in the online player profile, so resource packs can only be accessed when signed in. Marketplace packs can be applied the same way as custom resource packs including Realms, but not to worlds in external servers.

When a player joins a multiplayer world or Realm with Marketplace packs, the player is offered to download these packs to apply them, even when the player does not own the pack.

===== Default values =====
In the <code>biomes_client.json</code> file in the root of the resource pack, fallback values for all biome settings can be provided under the objects <code>biomes</code> <code>default</code>. These settings will be used for all biomes that don't provide them in their own client biome JSON files, and it will override all vanilla settings.

=== Internal resource packs ===
Most entities, biomes, loot tables, and various things from the base game are defined by the vanilla resource pack, which is built inside the game itself and can be found at {{cd|[[Microsoft.MinecraftUWP|''game directory'']]\data\resource_packs}}. Mojang Studios releases the [https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples Bedrock Add-On Sample Files] with every new [[update]] of ''Bedrock Edition'', which provide the latest vanilla behavior and resource packs from the game.

Multiple internal resource packs exist for different situations. Some [[experiments]] may have their own resource pack, in addition to ''[[Minecraft Education]]'' features and ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''. Each resource pack contains the same structure and assets as custom resource packs, defined for the whole game. Some packs also have an icon or description, which is not visible in-game.

''Bedrock Edition'' supports backwards-compatibility for add-ons and old worlds. This is done for the {{cd|vanilla}} and {{cd|chemistry}} resource packs since [[Bedrock Edition 1.14.0|1.14]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.50|1.20.50]] respectively, with the regular resource pack supporting the latest version before. Each update with changes to features defined in resource packs has its own resource packs, with all the features that changed. Some Marketplace add-ons can lock a world in an older version by disabling internal resource packs from higher versions.

=== pack.png ===
[[File:Alpha v1.2.2 pack.png|thumb|The world that the {{mono|pack.png}} screenshot was taken in, loaded in Alpha v1.2.2.]] 

The {{file|file|pack.png|inline=1}} was an image file used for the default resource pack icon before [[Java Edition 1.14]], and a grayscaled version of it is still used as a fallback for the world icon on the [[Select World]] screen as well as the [[server icon]] on the server list. The file shows a screenshot taken in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2]], in a world generated with the [[Seed (world generation)|seed]] {{cd|3257840388504953787}}.<ref>{{ytl|ea6py9q46QU|Pack.PNG has been FOUND! - Here's how they did it.|SalC1|September 7, 2020}}</ref> It was taken approximately at X=49.16, Z=0.72, with [[view angle]] facing RX=-119.23, RY=-8.297. This image has been referenced officially multiple times in the "[[One Trillion Minecraft Views on YouTube and Counting]]" video and ''Unpacked'' [[painting]] in the game.

* The seed can be used in versions Alpha 1.2.0 through Beta 1.7.3, with minor population differences between versions.
* It's possible to generate an identical world and take an identical screenshot, a guide on how to do that can be found here: https://pastebin.com/CmsEKDev.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftAtHome/comments/iocx6f/packpng_seed_was_found_explanation_tutorial_and</ref>
