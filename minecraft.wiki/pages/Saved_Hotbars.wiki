[[File:Saved Hotbars menu.png|thumb|The Saved Hotbars menu, with hotbars saved into rows 1, 3 and 4.]]

The '''Saved Hotbars'''<ref>Translation key from default [[language]] file <code>en_us.json</code>: <code>"itemGroup.hotbar": "Saved Hotbars"</code> (as of [[Java Edition 1.21|1.21]]).</ref> menu is a feature {{in|java}} that allows the [[Creative]] mode [[player]] to save selectable [[hotbar]] slots.

== Usage ==

Up to 9 hotbars can be saved.

The player can save their current row using (by default) {{key|C}} + a number {{key|1}} through {{key|9}} corresponding to which row in the inventory menu the hotbar row should be saved into. For instance, putting items in the hotbar and pressing {{key|C+1}} saves the player's current hotbar into row 1 of the Saved Hotbars inventory menu. This row can then be loaded into the hotbar using (by default) {{key|X+1}}. Note: the inventory must be closed in order to save or load hotbars.

By default, the 9 slots are marked with an informational [[paper]] item with instructions on how to save slots as its custom name.
If an empty hotbar is saved, it clears the bookmarked hotbar and puts back the paper into the respective slot.

The Saved Hotbar menu is common between all worlds the player loads &ndash; it is not saved locally to any individual world.

== Controls ==
{{Main|Controls#Configurable controls}}
The Saved Hotbar controls can be found in the "Creative Mode" section of the "Key Binds" [[options]] menu. The two options are:
* Load Toolbar Activator (default key: {{key|X}})
* Save Toolbar Activator (default key: {{key|C}})

== File format ==
Hotbars are saved into the <code>hotbar.nbt</code> file, an uncompressed [[NBT]] file found in root of the <samp>[[.minecraft]]</samp> folder, that is created the first time a hotbar is saved.

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag.
** {{nbt|list|0}}: List of nine tags, one for each hotbar slot. This is an ordered list, with the first child tag corresponding to the first slot in the hotbar.
*** {{nbt|compound|0}} An item in the inventory. For slots containing no items, this is <code>minecraft:air</code> with a <code>Count</code> of zero.
**** See [[Item_format/Before_1.20.5|item format/before 1.20.5]] for versions below 1.20.5. For versions above 1.20.5 see [[Data component format|Data Component Format]].
*** {{nbt|compound|1–8}} See above.
** {{nbt|list|1–8}}: See above.
** {{nbt|int|DataVersion}}: The [[data version]].
</div>

Note that nine {{nbt|list|List}} tags, <code>0</code>–<code>8</code>, are created regardless of how many hotbars have been saved.
