'''Villager No. 15''' is a character appearing during [[Minecraft Live 2024]], responsible for instigating the plot and later serving as an antagonist.

== Appearance ==
Villager No. 15 resembles a typical [[plains]] biome [[nitwit]], with no apparent deviations.

== Personality ==
Unlike other characters in the video, No. 15 appears to be rational and observant. Initially, he appears to be selfless, or at least empathetic, trying to warn other villagers of the creaking. However, as he continues to get belittled, he appears to grow vengeful and bitter, attempting to kill [[Villager No. 9]].

== Biography ==
At an unknown time, a group Villager No. 15 was a part of encountered a creaking inside of a forest, and managed to escape its clutches. Terrified, he attempted to warn the other villagers of the threat it poses, but ultimately was doubted and insulted. In an effort to disprove his claims, a group of villagers decided to go into the forest themselves, led by Villager No. 9.

As the villagers wandered inside, No. 9 claimed there was no such thing as monsters, only for the other villagers to point out [[Zombie|already]] [[Skeleton|known]] [[Hoglin|such]] [[Steve|cases]]. With this indirect support, No. 15 doubled down on his existing claims, clarifying that what he saw didn't look like any of them. When asked what it ''did'' look like, he sheepishly admits he couldn't quite make it out due to a [[Pale oak|tree]] blocking it. Even after one of them is taken by a creaking, they all refuse to believe him, and continue searching for apparent hours, only to get lost. Soon, a creaking begins killing each villager one by one, leaving only No. 9 and No. 15.

After the feed cuts off, it eventually resumes, with No. 9 and 15 huddling together. Having now seen the creaking with his own eyes, No. 9 is now a believer in the story. However, he ends up taking credit for finding it, and misnames it as the "crunching." Infuriated, No. 15 corrects the name, and places a [[Creaking Heart|creaking heart]] to get revenge on No. 9.

== Trivia ==

* Unlike the other named villagers, Villager No. 15 is not a pre-existing character in ''[[Villager News]]''.
* Due to his possession of a creaking heart and [[Iron Axe|iron axe]], it is possible that No. 15 was either intentionally luring villagers into the biome, or managed to defeat the original creakings.
