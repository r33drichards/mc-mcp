A '''creaking heart''' is a living [[block]]<ref name="pale">{{Citation|author=Sophie Austin |title=The Pale Garden |url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-pale-garden |website=minecraft.net |date=2 October 2024 |quote=While creaking hearts might look like wood, these are actually living blocks}}</ref><ref name="snap">{{snap|24w40a|October 2, 2024}}</ref> that can be [[crafted]] or found in [[pale oak]] trees in [[pale garden]]s. It activates if placed in a line between two [[pale oak log]]s; then, during [[Daylight cycle|nighttime]], it spawns a [[creaking]] and protects it from all [[damage]]. [[Breaking]] a creaking heart that is protecting a creaking instantly kills it. Hitting a protected creaking causes [[resin clump]]s to grow on [[pale oak log]]s near its linked creaking heart.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Creaking hearts drop as an item only when mined by a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. Otherwise, they drop 1–3 [[resin clump]]s; [[Fortune]] can increase the maximum drops by 1 per level (up to 6 with Fortune III).

Destroying a naturally-generated creaking heart also drops 20–24 [[experience]], only in [[Survival]] mode.

Creaking heart has the highest [[hardness]] value of all blocks having the axe as the suitable tool.

=== Natural generation ===
Creaking hearts have a 10% chance to generate inside the top trunks of [[pale oak]] trees in the [[pale garden]]. They are always completely covered by other [[pale oak log]]s and are never exposed to the air. Pale oaks grown from [[pale oak sapling]]s do not generate with hearts.

== Usage ==
A creaking heart can be placed in different orientations, similar to [[log]]s. It has three states: uprooted, dormant, and awake. The creaking heart is uprooted by default, but it becomes dormant during the day and awake at night when placed between two [[pale oak log]]s, [[stripped pale oak log]]s, [[pale oak wood]], or [[stripped pale oak wood]] with the same orientation. The texture of a creaking heart changes depending on its state, with the "core" appearing dark when uprooted, brighter when dormant and orange when awake. If the creaking heart hasn't already spawned a [[creaking]], removing one of the surrounding aligned logs reverts it to the uprooted state.

Creaking hearts generate [[resin clump]]s on nearby pale oak logs when its linked creaking is attacked by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]] at night. There is a 5-second cooldown between each resin clump generation.

=== Spawning mechanics ===
{{Main|Creaking#Spawning}}
[[File:Creaking Heart In Java Edition.png|right|thumb|A disabled creaking heart (left) and an active creaking heart (right)]]
If a creaking heart is properly aligned between two pale oak logs and is located in the [[Overworld]], it becomes awake at [[night]] (between 12600 and 23400 ticks). An awake creaking heart waits 2 [[tick]]s (0.1 seconds) and checks if the matching logs are in place. If so and it detects no linked creaking, it tries to find a valid location in a 33&times;17&times;33 box centered at that creaking heart to spawn one until successful, interrupted by getting destroyed or disabled. If found, it waits 20 ticks (1 second) before checking again if the matching logs are in place. If successful, it spawns a creaking after 2 extra ticks, otherwise it uproots. While a creaking heart is awake and has a linked creaking, it does not uproot until broken, even if any of the matching blocks are removed.

Creaking hearts do not function outside the [[simulation distance]] of players.

[[File:Creaking Heart Spawning Box.png|alt=The 33x17x33 box in which a Creaking Heart is able to spawn its Creaking.|thumb|Creaking can spawn in yellow or brown regions when provided with a valid spawning space by a spawnable block placed in yellow or orange regions and three blocks of air above it.]]

Valid locations for creakings to spawn at follow these criteria:
* The block below must have a solid top surface.
* The block below is not [[leaves]].
* The location is any non-solid block. This means blocks like [[carpet]] can spawn-proof creakings, but not [[button]]s.
* The location is where there would be no [[liquid]] or other entities' [[hitbox]]es within a creaking's hitbox.

[[Creaking]]s ignore solid blocks within its hitbox that are 2+ blocks above the ground while spawning.

Creaking hearts never spawn creakings in [[the Nether]] nor [[the End]].

=== Despawning creakings ===
Breaking the heart kills its linked creaking and attributes the kill to the [[player]] who broke it, adding the kill to their [[statistics]] and triggering the Monster Hunter and Monsters Hunted [[advancement]]s.

During daytime (starting at 23401 ticks), an awake creaking heart becomes dormant and despawns its linked creakings, unless it has been named using a [[name tag]].

If the heart's linked creaking is too far away (more than 34 blocks away), that creaking despawns, and the heart spawns another one if conditions are met.

=== Redstone component ===
A [[redstone comparator]] connected to a creaking heart outputs a signal if the heart has a linked creaking. The strength of the signal depends on the [[Euclidean distance]] between the heart and its creaking, and is calculated as follows: 

<math>\text{output} = 15 - \left\lfloor \frac{\text{distance}}{32} \times15 \right\rfloor</math>

In other words, the closer a creaking is to its heart, the stronger the signal.

Additionally, a creaking itself can be used to detect when a [[player]] is looking at it. An observed creaking will sink in [[water]] (or [[lava]]) instead of swimming upward, which can cause it to activate a [[pressure plate]] or similar means. Note that an unobserved creaking will bob up and down in liquid, which can cause it to sometimes activate a pressure plate even if not being looked at. Giving a creaking enough space to bob prevents this.

[[Piston]]s of any kind cannot move creaking hearts.

=== Ambient sounds ===
A creaking heart emits subtle [[#Unique|eerie sounds]] when it is awake and surrounded by any types of [[log]]s, [[stripped log]]s, [[wood]], or [[stripped wood]] in all 6 directions.
