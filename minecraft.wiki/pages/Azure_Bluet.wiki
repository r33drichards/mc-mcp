An '''azure bluet''' is a [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[light gray dye]] and [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
An azure bluet can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

An azure bluet also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Azure Bluet|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===

Azure bluets generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], [[flower forest]] and [[meadow]] biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features. {{IN|java}}, they are also technically capable of growing in [[dripstone caves]] and [[deep dark]] biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, azure bluets only generate as part of [[Flower#Flower gradients|gradients]]. 

Natural azure bluets are found in plains [[villages]]. Potted azure bluets can also be generated in [[woodland mansion]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

==== {{JE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, azure bluets can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, azure bluets cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

==== {{BE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, azure bluets can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, azure bluets cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When bone meal is applied to an azure bluet in any biome, more azure bluets appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up azure bluets, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell an azure bluet for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, azure bluets can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Azure bluets can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using an azure bluet imparts the {{EffectLink|Blindness}} effect for 11 seconds {{in|java}} or 7 seconds {{in|bedrock}}. It can be crafted using an azure bluet or produced by feeding an azure bluet to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s will attempt to collect nectar from azure bluets, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Azure bluets can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of an azure bluet have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing an azure bluet into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of azure bluets yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

* Unlike both parts of its name suggests, the azure bluets are not blue in ''Minecraft''. In real life, their pale-blue color looks light grey at a distance.
