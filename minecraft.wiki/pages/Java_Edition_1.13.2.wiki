== Trivia ==
* This was the last Minecraft version before the [[Texture Update]], when most of the blocks, items and mobs were implemented brand new [[textures]] created by the artist [[Jasper Boerstra]].
** After the Texture Update, the original textures are still available as an in-game [[resource pack]] named "Programmer Art".
** This was also the last version where the [[pack.png]] image was used as the default resource pack icon.
** This was also the last version to use the "-pre''n''" notation for pre-releases.
*This version came out exactly two months after the [[Java Edition 1.13.1|previous minor update]].
