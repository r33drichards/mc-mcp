* Added the {{cd|emit_vibration}} entity event response, which allows the entity to emit a vibration having the entity itself as its source.
** The {{cd|vibration}} field allows to specify the vibration to be emitted.
** The allowed values are {{cd|shear}}, {{cd|entity_act}}, and {{cd|entity_interact}}.

* Send <code>material</code> for vanilla data-driven blocks in the StartGamePacket blockProperties. <code>block_id</code> is also moved to the <code>vanilla_block_data</code> object.
* Released Molang queries from experimental:
** {{cd|query.is_cooldown_type}}
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time}}
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time_remaining}}
** {{cd|query.relative_block_has_any_tag}}

==== Blocks ====
'''[[Trial Spawner]]'''
* Trial spawner is a new variant of [[monster spawner]]s that ejects rewards upon completion and can have variable levels of challenge in multiplayer.
* The challenge level will increase for each new player a trial spawner notices nearby.
** Challenge level will not decrease until it is reset during a trial spawner's cooldown.
* Unlike normal spawners, a trial spawner will spawn a limited number of mobs proportional to its current challenge level.
** It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight.
** It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has.
** Spawned mobs are persistent and will not despawn.
* Once all mobs are defeated, the trial spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level.
** After the rewards have been ejected, the trial spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs.
* Trial spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout trial chambers.
* Trial spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with [[Silk Touch]].
* When placed in Creative, trial spawners have no mob type set by default.
** The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a spawn egg.
* Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by trial spawners.

==== Command format ====

'''[[File:Wolf Armor JE1 BE1.png|class=pixel-image|x32px]] [[Wolf Armor]]'''
* Crafted with 6 [[armadillo scute]]s in a harness shape.
* Protects [[wolves]] from damage.
** Wolf armor gives wolves the same protection level as [[diamond horse armor]].
* Using wolf armor on an adult tamed wolf will equip the armor on the wolf, and using [[shears]] will make it drop the armor.
** Only a wolf's owner can put on / shear off wolf armor. That also excludes dispensers.
* If a wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor.

==== Mobs ====
'''[[File:Armadillo BE1.png|32px]] [[Armadillo]]'''
* The winner of [[Minecraft Live 2023]]'s Mob Vote.
* A passive mob<ref name=ref3>Despite being referred to as a neutral mob on [[minecraft.net]], the armadillo is just a passive mob with a defense mechanic.</ref> that spawns in [[savanna]] biomes with the same frequency as [[chicken]]s and [[pig]]s.
* Has {{hp|12}} health points.
* Can drop [[armadillo scute]]s either periodically or when brushed, but drops no loot when killed.
** Armadillos drop scutes at around the same rate as chickens lay eggs.
** Brushing takes some durability from the [[brush]].
* Can be bred with [[spider eye]]s.
* If an armadillo detects a threat, it will roll up.
** Threats include:
*** A player sprinting.
*** A player in a vehicle or mounted.
*** [[Undead]] mobs.
** Special cases where an armadillo will not roll up include when it is:
*** Fleeing.
*** In water or in the air.
*** On a leash.
* When an Armadillo is rolled up it cannot walk nor eat, and will not be tempted by food.
* It continuously scans for threats, if none are detected for 3 seconds (60 ticks), it will unroll.

'''[[File:Breeze BE1.png|32px]] [[Breeze]]'''
* The breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via trial spawner in some rooms within the trial chambers.
* Has {{hp|30}} health points.
* Cannot be hit by [[arrow]]s or [[trident]]s.
* The breeze moves primarily by leaping around the target, sometimes jumping quite long distances.
* An aggressive adversary, the breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target.
* Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity.
* After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks.
* Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks:
** Non-iron doors and trapdoors are flipped.
** Fence gates are flipped.
** Buttons are pressed.
** Levers are flipped.
** Bells are rung and swung.
** Lit candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished.
* Wind bursts do not have any effect on iron doors, iron trapdoors, or any block being held in its position by a redstone signal.
* Currently does not drop any loot.

==== World generation ====
'''[[Trial Chambers]]'''
* Trial chambers are a new structure in the Overworld where players can explore and take on combat challenges during the mid-game.
** Trial chambers are made out of a variety of copper and tuff blocks and can be found in different sizes from large to small.
** Trial chambers are a relatively common find throughout the deepslate layer of the underground, with the starting piece generating at a height between <code>-40</code> and <code>-20</code>.
* The layout of each trial chamber is procedurally generated, and can include traps, supply and reward chests, decorated pots, and a variety of combat spaces.
** Traps include dispensers containing different potential items, such as [[arrow]]s or [[fire charge]]s.
** Supply chests can be found between the different rooms, and give the player blocks and items which help them navigate their trials.
** Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of many high level enchanted books and equipment.
** Decorated pots found in hallways can contain supplies such as iron or arrows. Some pots are decorated and others are blank.
** The loot found in reward chests and decorated pots are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final as well as the loot from defeating mobs from a trial spawner.
* Each trial chamber will include trial spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category:
** ''Melee''
*** [[Zombie]]
*** [[Husk]]
*** [[Slime]]
** ''Small Melee''
*** [[Spider]]
*** [[Cave Spider]]
*** [[Baby Zombie]]
*** [[Silverfish]]
** ''Ranged''
*** [[Skeleton]]
*** [[Stray]]
* Each trial spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each trial chamber.
** For example, one trial chamber might only spawn zombies, cave spiders and strays, while another might only spawn slimes, silverfish and skeletons.
** The exceptions to this are some trial spawners in unique rooms which always spawn breezes.
* Regular mob spawning does not happen inside the bounding boxes of the trial chamber pieces.

* The {{cd|minecraft:unit_cube}} block component has been deprecated. Using it in content marked <code>1.20.60</code> and beyond will provide a content error.
** Using content marked prior to 1.20.60 will have their {{cd|minecraft:unit_cube}} block component upgraded to a {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component with a {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} identifier, but will maintain backwards compatibility with all behaviors.
* The block component {{cd|minecraft:random_ticking}} is now supported again.

'''[[Molang]]'''
* Changed cooldown query slot IDs to be required for container slots with more than one index, logging content errors if not provided.
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time(slotName,slotId)}}
** {{cd|query.cooldown_time_remaining(slotName,slotId)}}
** {{cd|query.is_cooldown_type(cooldownName,slotName,slotId)}}
