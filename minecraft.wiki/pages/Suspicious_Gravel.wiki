'''Suspicious gravel''' is a fragile [[Falling Block|gravity-affected block]] found in various Overworld [[Structure|structures]]. It can be [[Brush|brushed]] to extract unique structure-dependent loot from it. It drops nothing if it breaks, and will break if it falls or is moved.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|java}}, suspicious gravel drops as an [[item (entity)|item]] if it falls for more than 30 seconds, which can be achieved by falling into an upward [[bubble column]], or through two [[cobweb]]s stacked on top of each other.<ref>{{bug|MC-260073||Suspicious gravel drops as an item after 30 seconds of existing as falling block|WF}}</ref> However, it does not retain its loot.<br>
{{IN|bedrock}}, suspicious gravel can be obtained only through the [[Creative inventory]], using {{control|pick block}} in [[Creative]] mode and [[command]]s.

=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break suspicious gravel is [[shovel]].

Suspicious gravel drops nothing when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Suspicious gravel generates naturally in cold [[ocean ruins]]. Additionally, some of the [[gravel]] within [[trail ruins]] is replaced with suspicious gravel upon generation.

== Usage ==
=== Brushing ===
When a [[brush]] is {{ctrl|used}} on suspicious gravel, cracks start to appear on all sides of the block as the {{cd|dusted}} block state of the block starts to increase. If the suspicious gravel being brushed is naturally generated, an item gradually emerges from the side where the player starts brushing. After 96 (6+20+30+40 per stage) [[game tick]]s (4.8 seconds), the item is extracted, and the suspicious gravel is converted into [[gravel]].

If the player stops brushing a suspicious gravel, the block remains in its half-excavated state for a few seconds, before gradually returning to its unexcavated state one stage at a time.

=== Loot ===
The item obtained and the [[loot table]] of suspicious gravel is dependent on which structure it has generated in. Items can be extracted only from naturally generated suspicious gravel. When placed by the player, nothing is produced after brushing.
