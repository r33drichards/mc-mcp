{{animate|Creaking Heart.png;Active Creaking Heart.png|32px}} '''[[Creaking Heart]]'''
* A creaking heart is a “living” block generating in pale oak trees, covered on all sides by pale oak wood logs.
* Can be found activated in the [[pale garden]] biome.
* Sends a trail of particles towards the connected [[creaking]] when the [[creaking]] gets hit by the player or projectiles.
** Particle speed is affected by the distance of the [[creaking]] from the heart block.
** Attacking a [[creaking]] will cause its Creaking Heart to exude 2 to 3 Resin Clumps.
* Naturally placed Creaking Hearts drop 20-24 experience when broken by a player, with or without silk touch.
* Breaking a Creaking Heart block will drop 1-3 Resin Clumps, and it is affected by Fortune enchantment.
* Only activates when placed between two Pale Oak logs in the same orientation (on the side that does not light up when active) and can't be deactivated unless the block is broken.
** Emits subtle eerie sounds when it is active and surrounded by any types of [[log]]s, [[stripped log]]s, [[wood]], or [[stripped wood]] on all 6 directions.
* Mining the block is most efficiently done with an axe, but it only drops when using a [[Silk Touch]] tool.
** When creaking heart block is destroyed, the connected creaking is removed.
* Can also be crafted using [[pale oak log]]s and a [[block of resin]].

'''[[Add-On]]s and Script Engine'''
*The [Beta] fields in the {{cd|minecraft:looked_at}} and {{cd|minecraft:home}} entity components are no longer marked as [Beta] and no longer require {{cd|use_beta_features}} to be specified in the root JSON object.

'''API'''
*Added {{cd|beforeEvents}} object to {{cd|@minecraft/server-net}} module version {{cd|1.0.0-beta}} which exposes two events:
**{{cd|packetReceive}}: This event is called when the game server receives a network packet from a client. If cancelled, the server will silently ignore the packet.
**{{cd|packetSend}}: This event is called when the game server sends a network packet to client(s). If cancelled, the packet is dropped and never sent to the recipients.
*Added additional optional arguments of {{cd|name}} and {{cd|parentThemeId}} to {{cd|addNewTheme()}}. When a valid {{cd|parentThemeId}} has been passed through the function, the newly created theme would inherit all the theme color properties from the parent.
*Vanilla trial spawner NBT {{cd|normalConfig}} and {{cd|ominousConfig}} tags values now support references to common configurations as an alternative to inline configuration.

'''[[Audio]]'''
*Per-biome ambient sounds are now defined in {{cd|client_biome}} JSON components
**This uses the new {{cd|minecraft:ambient_sounds}} component
**Named sounds must be defined in {{cd|individual_named_sounds}} in {{cd|sounds.json}} files.

'''[[Biome]]s'''
*Client biome JSON files now support a {{cd|minecraft:biome_music}} component with a {{cd|volume_multiplier}} field which will gradually affect music volume when the audio listener is inside the corresponding biome.
**The gradual volume change will take roughly ten seconds and will linearly increase but exponentially decrease.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Updated {{cd|minecraft:destructible_by_mining}} component, new field {{cd|item_specific_speeds}} no longer experimental.
*Added new field {{cd|ambient_occlusion_exponent}} to {{cd|blocks.json}} file schema in resource packs, replaces broken {{cd|brightness_gamma}} field.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:liquid_detection}} component which controls the basic liquid detection properties of a block, such as liquidlogging, liquid blocking, and being broken or popped by liquid spread. The only liquid currently supported by the component is water.
*Using the {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}} item component to render the referenced block as the item icon no longer requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle.

'''Entity Components'''
*Added a new component {{cd|minecraft:cannot_be_attacked}}. When added to an entity it prevents other entities from attacking it unless they fulfill an exception filter, in vanilla it is added to [[ghast]]s, creators can add their entities to the exception filter allowing them to then attack ghasts.
*The {{cd|minecraft:looked_at}} component's {{cd|look_at_locations}} field now accepts a list of objects as a parameter, each containing two fields
**{{cd|location}}, the location of the entity that must be visible
***Valid values: {{cd|head}}, {{cd|body}}, {{cd|feet}}
**{{cd|vertical_offset}}, an optional vertical offset applied to the entity's location
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:ignore_cannot_be_attacked}} component and moved the filter from {{cd|minecraft:cannot_be_attacked}} to it. This allows content to have custom mobs which bypass the {{cd|cannot_be_attacked}} component (for example the one on the [[ghast]]) without requiring a modification of the attacked mob's settings.
*The {{Cd|code=minecraft:angry}} component now has a new field:
** {{Cd|code=broadcast_anger_when_dying}} defines whether an entity should broadcast anger to entities of the same type if killed in one hit. This is set to {{Cd|code=true}} by default.
** This change was not mentioned in the changelog.

'''Entity Event Responses'''
*Added the {{cd|play_sound}} entity event response, which allows the owner entity to emit sounds.
**The {{cd|sound}} field specifies the sound event to play.
**Sounds are played at the owner entity's position.
*The {{cd|execute_event_on_home_block}} entity event response is now marked as {{cd|[Beta]}} and requires {{cd|use_beta_features}} to be specified in the root JSON object.
*Added the {{cd|emit_particle}} entity event response, allowing particles to be emitted at the center of the entity's bounding box.
**The {{cd|particle}} field allows to specify the type of particle to emit.

'''General'''
*Creating a new world from a template that supports random seeds will now clear any stored spawn position from the level data.

'''[[Molang]]'''
*Moved {{cd|query.client_memory_tier}} to {{cd|stable}}.

'''{{cmd|place}}'''
*Added {{cd|place}}.

==== Technical ====
'''Add-Ons and Script Engine'''
*Added {{cd|canUseBlockAsIcon}} bool to the {{cd|minecraft:block_placer}} item component network data to fix bug where clients did not render the block item correctly.

'''API'''
*Add {{cd|collectRuntimeStats}} to {{cd|@minecraft/debug-utilities}} module, exposing script runtime memory usage.
*Added new input permissions that effectively allow creators to enable/disable player inputs including: lateral movement, move forward, move backward, move left, move right, sneak, jump, mount, and dismount.
**Extended {{cd|PlayerInputPermissions}} script class to read and write the new input permissions
**Extended {{cmd|/inputpermission}} command to use the new input permissions
**Extended {{cd|haspermission}} selector to use the new input permissions
*Added {{cd|initialRotation}} optional member to {{cd|SpawnEntityOptions}} for specifying the initial rotation of the spawned entity in degrees.
*Added new method {{cd|lookAt}} to {{cd|Entity}} which sets the rotation of the entity to face the desired target location.
*Added {{cd|shutdown}} event to {{cd|beforeEvents}} within the {{cd|system}} class. This is fired after all players have left and the world is about to shutdown/close.

'''Blocks'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:item_visual}} block component. This component takes nested {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} and {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} components to configure the item representation of a block
**{{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}} fields are required. They utilize the same fields/requirements as {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} and {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} respectively
**Block must include {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} and {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} components alongside the {{cd|minecraft:item_visual}} component
**Requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle
*Cobwebs now obey {{cd|blockshape}} and {{cd|textures}} properties set in {{cd|blocks.json}}
**Requires the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle

'''Camera'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:fixed_boom}} preset to the "Creator Cameras: New Third Person Presets" experimental toggle.
*Added experimental toggle "Aim Assist" to allow easy targeting while using custom camera perspectives.

*Aim assist can be enabled through {{cd|/aimassist}} command.
**Aim assist's targeting behavior (distance, width, and height) can be configured through the settings under {{cd|aim_assist}} folder using a behavior pack.
**Aim assist will highlight the selected target. The highlighting textures are customizable through textures under {{cd|textures\ui}} folder using a resource pack.
*Added the rotation to the camera command for the {{cd|fixed_boom}} camera

'''[[Molang]]'''
*Added {{cd|query.last_input_mode_is_any}}. 
**It takes one or more arguments ({{cd|keyboard_and_mouse}}, {{cd|touch}}, {{cd|gamepad}}, or {{cd|motion_controller}}). If the last input used is any of the specified string values, returns 1.0. Otherwise returns 0.0. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only. 
*Added {{cd|query.touch_only_affects_hotbar}}. 
**It returns 1.0 if the touch input only affects the touchbar, otherwise returns 0.0. Available on the Client (Resource Packs) only.

'''Scripting'''
*Added enum {{cd|InputMode}}. 
**{{cd|<nowiki>export enum InputMode { Gamepad = 'Gamepad', KeyboardAndMouse = 'KeyboardAndMouse', MotionController = 'MotionController', Touch = 'Touch', Undetermined = 'Undetermined', }</nowiki>}}

'''Structures'''
*Expose "Data-Driven [[Jigsaw Structure]]s" experiment toggle to Creators
**Creators will be able to modify structure generation rules around placement (location and frequency), layout (how structure pieces are placed relative to one another), and customization (how blocks within a structure piece are modified or replaced).
**There are 4 new JSON files comprising Jigsaw Structure data:
***Jigsaw Structures: These are structures that can be constructed throughout the world with various structure pieces. The connection block is a jigsaw block.
***Processors: A processor can add custom behaviors to the structure that affects how it looks.
***Structure Sets: Structure sets are JSON that indicate where and how a structure is placed throughout the world.
***Template Pools: A template pool contains the structure pieces that make up a structure.

'''UI'''
*Added support for input glyph replacement for signed books. For example, using input string {{cd|:_input_key.jump:}} will be replaced with "JUMP" when using keyboard, or an emoji in case of using a gamepad.
