{{q|Dinnerbone is a super nice guy, and adds lots of fancy features to Minecraft. He wears ribbons in his hair, and smells of rich mahogany and leather-bound books. He is the co-president of the country of Bonerstan, along with Marc. If you kill him in Minecraft, he drops a kitten. Correction: he gently sets down a kitten, because why would he ever DROP a kitten? He's way too nice for that.|[[Marc Watson]]<ref>[[Special:Diff/329409]]</ref><ref>{{tweet|Marc_IRL|214903429917712385|Learned how to edit the Minecraft wiki. Am I doing it right?|June 18, 2012}}</ref>}}

== Trivia ==
* Dinnerbone is red-green [[wikipedia:Color blindness|colorblind]], which is the most common type of colorblindness.<ref>http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/future-updates/384441-1-5-new-blocks-items?comment=11</ref>
** This is why rubies were replaced by [[emerald]]s.<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/future-updates/384441-1-5-new-blocks-items?page=2</ref>
* Dinnerbone's username is a tribute to an old friend of his named Teabone (T-bone).<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|248379944101609472|@XxzJackozxX I once, long ago when I was new to the whole interwebs thing, knew a cool guy named Teabone. I took this name in respect to him|Sep 19, 2012}}</ref>
* Dinnerbone's favorite color is blue, his favorite foods are lasagna and pizza, and his "guilty pleasure" is milkshakes.<ref name=MilkshakeKetchup>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|1068931314227822593|My guilty pleasure is milkshakes. I love milkshakes.<br><br>Today I went to go get a nice strawberry milkshake at this new place that opened near me.
