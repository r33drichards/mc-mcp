{{Q|“Biome Fest” is a song that I created when Minecraft Alpha was done, but I felt it had no place anywhere in the game, until the creative mode was sort of reintroduced to the game. It’s one of my favourite songs I’ve ever created. I do love minimalism and achieving tones with just very few notes, and I think this song does that extremely well.|C418|c418.org}}

{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Biome fest.ogg]]

"Biome Fest" begins with a dreamlike choir of synthesized voices fading in, which makes way to an electronic song with bells and tribal percussion in the background. It ends with the same choir that it begins with, fading out.
