The '''Hydra''' is three-headed lizard-like mythological creature that appeared in ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]'' as minor antagonist in [[Twist of the Plot]].

== Appearance == 
The Hydra looks like a lizard, but unlike lizards it has two legs and three heads located on long necks. Its belly, teeth and parts of its neck are colored yellow, and the rest of its body is green, and its pupils are red.

== Biography == 
After Durango, Zed, Quinn and CommuniKate dug into the cave with the chest, the Hydra appeared and began to attack the heroes. The heroes decided to split up, and Quinn began to distract the Hydra, and the latter ran after her, and then the Hydra began to charge a strong attack, but Durango and CommuniKate jumped on her back and hit the Hydra in the neck, and then when shot, the Hydra exploded from inside.

== Power and Abilities ==
As shown in the series, Hydra can shoot [[fireball]]s from its mouts of her three heads, and the force of their explosion depends on the charging time. Hydra also has enormous strength (for example, when it easily threw Zed many meters with its tail).

== Trivia ==
* The Hydra is called the [[wikipedia:Lernaean Hydra|Lernaean Hydra]] in [[wikipedia:Greek Mythology|Greek Mythology]] in reference to its lair being the lake of [[Wikipedia:Lerna|Lerna]] in the [[Wikipedia:Regions of ancient Greece#Argolis|Argolid]].
