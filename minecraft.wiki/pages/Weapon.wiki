{{Dungeons hatnote|type=item}}
'''Weapons''' are items used to deal [[damage]] to [[entities]]. They include tools, projectiles, obstacles, and traps. Some weapons can be [[enchanted]] to enhance their combat efficacy.

== Overview ==
Melee weapons can be held in the main hand while pressing the {{control|attack}} control to deal more damage than punching.

Ranged weapons can be {{control|used}} to fire projectiles.
* A [[bow]] or [[crossbow]] is a [[tool]] that uses [[arrow]] items (or requires 1 arrow if it has [[Infinity]]) and fires them as projectiles.
* [[Egg]]s, [[snowball]]s, [[splash potion]]s, [[lingering potion]]s, and [[wind charge]]s can be fired directly by using them.
* [[Fire charge]]s (fired by dispensers) and [[wind charge]]s (fired directly) are special "hurting" projectiles, which move in a straight line and aren't affected by gravity.

Block weapons are typically used by {{control|placing}} them. A [[redstone circuit]] can be used in various ways, depending on its design. <!--Weapon property tables coming soon. See [[User:Simanelix/Sandbox/Weapon]].-->

== Melee weapons ==
Melee weapons can be used to deal damage within a [[player]]'s reach distance. A player can attack with the held weapon by pressing the {{control|attack}} control. {{IN|java}}, the damage dealt by melee weapons is affected by the [[attack cooldown]]: in order to deal maximum damage again, the player must wait for the weapon to "recharge" after each attack.

=== Sword ===
* {{ItemLink|Sword|Swords}}, along with spears, are the only weapon to get access to [[Looting]] and [[Knockback]]. In Java Edition the [[Sweeping Edge]]{{only|java}} exists, which can only be applied to swords. {{IN|java}}, all swords have a cooldown time of 0.6 seconds (40% faster than golden, diamond, and netherite axes), are the only weapon type that can do [[Sword#Sweeping|sweep attacks]] to hit multiple targets, and have high damage per second. {{IN|be}}, they deal more damage than any other melee weapon except for [[trident]]s, and have no attack cooldown.

=== Axe ===
* {{ItemLink|Axe|Axes}} are the only weapon that can disable a player's [[shield]]. {{IN|je}}, they deal more damage per hit than their sword counterparts, but have a slower cooldown. Wooden and stone axes have a cooldown time of 1.2 seconds, 100% slower than swords. Iron axes have a cooldown time of 1.1 seconds, 77.7% slower than swords. Golden, diamond, and netherite axes have a cooldown time of 1 second, 60% slower than swords. {{IN|be}}, axes deal {{hp|1}} less damage than their sword counterparts, and have no attack cooldown.

=== Trident ===
* {{ItemLink|Trident|Tridents}} can be swung to deal {{hp|9}} damage, the same as an unenchanted stone, iron, or diamond axe {{in|java}}, or as an unenchanted [[netherite sword]] {{in|bedrock}}. {{IN|java}}, their attack speed is 10% faster than golden, diamond, and netherite axes, being 0.9 seconds. Tridents cannot be crafted, and can only be obtained from defeating [[drowned]] who wield them, or through [[vault]]s in [[trial chambers]].

=== Mace ===
* {{ItemLink|Mace|Maces}} deal {{hp|6}} base damage and, {{in|java}}, have a cooldown time of 1.67 seconds, slower than wooden and stone axes and the slowest in the game. Maces can perform smash attacks that increase damage output depending on the distance fallen before attacking. Successfully performing a smash attack will remove any fall damage accumulated prior to the attack. They can be crafted using a [[breeze rod]] and a [[heavy core]], both of which are obtained from [[trial chambers]].

=== Spear ===
* {{ItemLink|Spear|Spears}} can perform two different types of attacks: a jab attack and a charge attack. The jab attack functions as its standard attack, but has a [[use cooldown]] similar to that of an [[ender pearl]] afterwards in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition it uses a version of the normal attack cooldown.
* The charge attack deals damage based on the user's horizontal velocity, and progresses through three states when held out. 
** In the initial state, the charge attack dismounts attacked targets from their mounts, in addition to dealing damage and knockback. 
** After being held out for too long, the charge attack goes into a shaking state where attacks no longer dismount targets from their mounts.
** After even longer, the charge attack goes into a dropped down state where attacks no longer deal knockback, but still deal full damage.

=== Other ===
* Other [[tool]]s, [[pickaxe]]s, [[shovel]]s, and [[hoe]]s can be used as weapons, but they are not effective melee weapons due to poor stats and a lack of access to weapon enchantments.

* [[Sword]]s, [[trident]]s, [[mace]]s, and [[spear]]s lose one [[durability]] point when used as weapons, while [[axe]]s, [[pickaxe]]s, [[shovel]]s, and [[hoe]]s lose two points.

== Ranged weapons ==
Ranged weapons are less effective in close combat and more effective at attacking enemies from a distance.

* {{ItemLink|Bow|Bows}} are the most common ranged weapon, used to shoot [[arrow]]s at enemies to deal damage. Bows can be charged by pressing the {{control|use}} control: arrows go the farthest and deal the most damage when shot from a fully charged bow. Bows can be crafted using sticks and string, but are also a rare drop from [[skeleton]]s and [[stray]]s.

* {{ItemLink|Crossbow|Crossbows}} have a longer range than bows, and deal more damage, but take longer to charge when unenchanted. The charging time can be drastically reduced with the [[Quick Charge]] enchantment to charge far faster than a bow. They can also shoot [[firework rocket]]s to deal splash damage, but unlike the bow, crossbows cannot fire a partially charged attack; the player must fully charge a crossbow to load it and fire. Furthermore, a crossbow can be charged and put away to be fired later. Crossbows use triple durability when firing firework rockets, and also when fired while enchanted with [[Multishot]]. They can be crafted using sticks, string, [[iron ingot]]s, and [[tripwire hook]]s, but can also be dropped from pillagers and certain piglins.

* {{ItemLink|Trident|Tridents}} can also be thrown to deal {{hp|8}} damage, the same as an unenchanted netherite sword in {{JE}}. Unlike most other [[projectile]]s, they are not slowed down in water. A thrown trident must be retrieved, unless enchanted with [[Loyalty]].

* {{ItemLink|Fire Charge|Fire charges}} cannot be launched by a player, but can be fired as [[small fireball]]s by a [[dispenser]]. When it hits an entity that is not immune to fire, a small fireball deals {{hp|5}} damage and sets the entity on fire for 4 seconds. When it lands on a block, it does not cause an explosion, but sets the block on fire if possible. It can also be used to prime TNT. Fire charges can be crafted using [[coal]], [[blaze powder]], and [[gunpowder]].

* {{ItemLink|Splash Potion|Splash potions}}, {{ItemLink|Lingering Potion|lingering potions}}, or {{ItemLink|Tipped Arrow|tipped arrows}} of [[Instant Damage]] or [[Poison]] can be effectively used to damage enemies. Other effects like [[Weakness]], [[Slowness]], and [[Slow Falling]] can be used to significantly hinder an opponent in a fight. Splash potions can be obtained by brewing regular potions with [[gunpowder]], lingering potions can be obtained by brewing splash potions with [[dragon's breath]], and [[tipped arrow]]s can be obtained by crafting arrows with lingering potions, or, {{in|bedrock}}, by tipping arrows in a [[Cauldron#Holding potions|potion-filled cauldron]].

* Throwable items
** Deal [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]] to mobs and players in {{in|bedrock}}, and only mobs {{in|java}}.
** Cause [[durability]] damage to [[armor]].
** Unlike a bow, these can be thrown quickly.
** {{ItemLink|Egg|text=Eggs}}
*** Has the same chance to spawn a [[chicken]] when used as a weapon, regardless of which entity it hits.
** {{ItemLink|Snowball|text=Snowballs}}
*** Thrown by [[snow golem]]s as their only defense mechanism.
*** Deals {{hp|3}} damage to a [[blaze]].

* {{ItemLink|Wind Charge|text=Wind charges}} deal {{Hp|1}} on contact with a mob and heavy knockback to nearby entities. They can also interact with certain [[redstone components]]. Wind charges can be obtained as a product of grinding breeze rods in a crafting table.

* {{BlockLink|TNT}} can be used to launch other TNT, making it a ranged weapon that requires some setup.

== Other weapons ==
Other items listed below can be used as weapons but usually have other intended uses and should be used strategically.

*{{BlockLink|TNT}} is capable of causing a large [[explosion]] when lit using fire, but has a long delay before the explosion, so it must be timed well to be used properly.

* {{ItemLink|End Crystal|End crystals}}, {{BlockLink|Respawn Anchor|respawn anchors}}, and {{BlockLink|Bed|beds}} are capable of causing massive explosions, but are also very situational. Beds and respawn anchors only explode when used in the wrong dimension (anywhere except the Overworld and Nether, respectively). End crystals can only be placed on [[obsidian]] or [[bedrock]]. Beds and respawn anchors mainly allow the player to respawn at their positions in their respective dimensions, and end crystals can also be used to resurrect the [[ender dragon]], as well as being used by it to regenerate health for itself.

* {{ItemLink|Flint and Steel|Flint and steel}} and {{ItemLink|Fire Charge|fire charges}} can light [[fire]]s, which can be used to deal great amounts of damage. Most mobs native to the Nether are immune to this.

* {{ItemLink|Lava Bucket|Lava buckets}} can be used to place [[lava]], which deals great amounts of fire damage and slows down entities inside it, rendering it one of the most powerful weapons in an arsenal. Most mobs native to the Nether are immune to this.

* {{ItemLink|Redstone Dust|Redstone}} traps can be used to kill the entity with all sorts of environmental damage, ranging from fall damage to suffocation to anything in between, but these must be prepared beforehand, so they oftentimes cannot be used in conventional combat.

*{{BlockLink|Anvil|Anvils}} can deal massive damage to entities they fall onto, and also deal heavy damage to helmets regardless of if they land a lethal hit. However, these must be prepared beforehand, so they are more useful as traps than weapons. They also take damage when they land, so they can only be used as weapons a limited amount of times, so they must be used sparingly. Anvils are mainly used as repair stations that can also combine enchantments.

* {{BlockLink|Pointed dripstone}} can be dropped onto an entity like an anvil to deal damage, and can also deal double fall damage if an entity falls onto it.

* {{BlockLink|Cobweb|Cobwebs}} greatly slow all entities inside them, which can be used strategically to gain a massive advantage. They do not, however, do anything to [[arthropod]]s.

* Some [[block]]s cause damage on contact, and can be used as obstacles to hinder mobs and other players. These include [[cacti]], [[sweet berry bush]]es, [[wither rose]]s (if target is not immune to [[Wither (effect)|Wither]]), [[campfire]]s (if target is not immune to fire), and [[magma block]]s (if the target isn't [[sneaking]], wearing [[Frost Walker]] boots, or is immune to fire).

* [[Hostile mobs]] can also be used as weapons, especially since some mobs can be manipulated easily. However, these mobs tend to attack any player without provocation, and there are also certain groups of mobs that do not attack each other even if provoked. Great care must be taken if hostile mobs are to be used as weapons.
** A {{EntityLink|fireball}} shot by a [[ghast]] can be deflected. It has an explosive effect and sets its surroundings on fire upon impact.
