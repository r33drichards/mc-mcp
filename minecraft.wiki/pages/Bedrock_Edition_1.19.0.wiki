**Picks up dropped items in loaded chunks and can carry up to a stack at a time,<ref>https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q81usv/comment/hgmfpl6</ref> and cannot duplicate items<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1447945258743091200|Allays are not item duplicators, they pick up items nearby on the floor that are the same item it has been given. So you could give it a dirt block, then it finds dirt blocks that are dropped, collect them, then return and drop them to you or a note block you've set up.|October 12, 2021}}</ref> or take items out of chests.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1447945260366286853|They cannot get items from chests either. Only dropped items. You could feasibly use this for item sorting if you make a cool contraption :D|October 12, 2021}}</ref> It drops its collected items when in range of a [[note block]].
**Allay collects an item within 32 blocks of the player.
<!-- Do not add any information regarding the jukebox. As of now, it is confirmed that only the allay can drop items in range of a note block. Nowhere has it been stated by a Minecraft developer that the allay can also drop items in range of a jukebox. Adding the mention of a jukebox without a proper source stating such will be immediately reverted. -->
*If holding an item it got from a player, it follows that player.
**It can be made to hold an item by interacting with the allay.
**The item can also be removed by interacting with the allay while with an empty hand.
*Able to drop items at nearby [[note block]]s, and stay close to a note block that has been played near them.
*When playing a note block near them, that note block becomes their favorite one for 30 seconds, and they attempt to drop off items at the note block rather than at the player.
**Connecting with [[note block]]s is visualized by the vibration particle.
**Connecting with note blocks can be blocked by [[wool]], by placing wool between the allay and the note block.
*If they have items in their inventory, they attempt to give them to their owner.
*Sometimes spawn in cages next to [[pillager outpost]]s (similar to [[iron golem]]), and inside [[woodland mansion]]s.
*Has a delay for picking new items after delivering items (3 seconds).
*Immune to damage from its owner while holding an item.

'''{{animate|Temperate Frog JE1 BE1.gif;Cold Frog JE1 BE1.gif;Warm Frog JE1 BE1.gif|32px}} {{Text anchor|[[Frog]]}}'''
*Comes in three variants: temperate, warm, and cold.
**The temperate variant is orange, the warm variant is white, and the cold variant is green.

**Prefer to jump to [[lily pad]] and [[big dripleaf]].

**Eats small [[slime]]s, dropping [[slime ball]]s.
**Eats small [[magma cube]]s, dropping froglights.

**Lay eggs on water after mating.
*Grow from [[tadpole]]s.
**Variants depend on the [[Biome#Temperature_2|temperature]] of the biome it turns from a tadpole to a frog in.
*Have {{hp|10}} health points.

'''[[File:Tadpole.png|40px]] {{Text anchor|[[Tadpole]]}}'''
*Grows up into a frog 20 minutes after birth, which can be sped up using slimeballs.
**Frog type depends on which temperature it grows in.
*Can be held in a [[water bucket]].
*Jump around like fish when on land, and eventually die.
**Panics on land and pathfinds to a nearby water source.
*Are hunted down by [[axolotl]]s.
**Also panics if there are axolotls nearby.
*Have {{hp|6}} health points.

'''[[File:Warden JE1 BE1.png|51x51px]] [[Warden]]'''
*The first fully blind mob (bats have basic eyesight, both in-game and in the real world).
**Because of this, it stumbles as it walks.
**Has a sense of smell. It can detect and pathfind toward the general location of a player or mob through a "smelling" action.
***Prioritizes smelling the player or mob that it is most suspicious of, rather than the one closest to it.
**Has a sense of vibration. When sensing movement, it pathfinds toward the source of the movement.
***It follows and attacks players, mobs, and other entities that make vibrations.<ref group="note">The Warden does not attack non-mob entities but it does follow the vibrations that they make.</ref>
****It does not attack other wardens.
***When it detects a vibration, the growths on its head rattle and light up, similar to the [[sculk sensor]].
****Seems to follow the same rules as the [[sculk sensor]] when detecting vibrations.
****If any projectile (e.g. [[egg]], [[snowball]], [[arrow]]) lands near it, the warden inspects the location where the projectile landed, due to the projectile creating significant vibrations. This feature can be used in order to cause a distraction.
***Does not detect players that are sneaking.
**Can detect players or mobs that have the [[Invisibility]] effect.
*Becomes more suspicious of a player or mob as it detects its location more through vibrations and/or smelling. When it suspects the target enough, it identifies its exact location, which aggravates it, causing it to pathfind toward the target to attack regardless of outside distractions.
*Spawns in the deep dark biome, specifically when a player activates sculk shriekers four times.
**It is the only mob that spawns in the deep dark biome.
*"Emerges" from the ground when spawned by [[sculk shrieker]]s.
**Digs back into the ground when it doesn't sense any vibration after 60 seconds.
***Like how [[name tags]] prevent despawning, name tags can also prevent wardens from being able to burrow back to the ground.
* A mob designed to be extremely difficult, intended to be avoided and fled from.
**Has {{hp|500}} health points and does {{hp|30}} damage on Normal difficulty, bringing players wearing full [[netherite]] [[armor]] from full health to {{hp|7}} health points. Wardens also disable shields when they hit the players with their fists, and are at least as fast as a walking player. (More health than a wither ({{hp|300}}) except in BE, hard mode, where Wither HP = {{hp|600}})
*Warden's chest has a glowing core that appears to brighten and dim in tandem with the Darkness effect.
**The core creates a low throbbing or "heartbeat" sound as it pulses. The sound and animation speed up rapidly as the warden gets more suspicious of or closer to attacking a player or mob.
*Is about 3.5 blocks tall, making it one of the tallest mobs in the game, exceeding the [[iron golem]] and [[enderman]] in height and width (the same).
**Wardens have long melee reach, being able to hit the player when on top of a four block pillar, thus making it capable of countering certain cheese tactics, such as pillaring.
*Can charge a ranged attack when the player is building high, hiding behind walls or being out of range of their melee attack.
**Their rib cages open up to shriek a sonically charged ranged attack that can penetrate walls and bypasses shields and armor.
**The ranged attack deals {{Hp|10}} damage in Normal and can hit at a horizontal distance of 15 blocks.
**The ranged attack can hit only one target at a time.
*Is immune to [[lava]] and knockback.
*Drops a [[sculk catalyst]] upon death.
