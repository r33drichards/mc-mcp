A '''raid captain'''{{fn|Known as '''raid captain''' {{in|java}} and '''illager captain''' {{in|bedrock}}.}} is the occurrence of an [[illager]] that spawns wearing an [[ominous banner]] on its head. It is usually a [[pillager]] or [[vindicator]], or rarely {{in|java}} an [[evoker]]. They are the only renewable source of both [[ominous banner]]s and [[ominous bottle]]s, which they drop when killed.

== Spawning ==
Raid captains spawn in mostly the same conditions and occurrences as a regular [[illager]], with a few exceptions.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a [[pillager]] raid captain can be spawned using the {{cmd|summon pillager ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_as_illager_captain}} command, and a [[vindicator]] raid captain (which is unused in-game) can be spawned using the {{cmd|summon vindicator ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_as_illager_captain}} command.

{{IN|java}}, pillagers, vindicators and evokers spawned from [[spawn egg]]s, [[monster spawner]]s or [[trial spawner]]s also have a small chance to spawn as a raid captain.

=== Patrols ===
{{main|Patrol}}
One pillager raid captain always spawns as part of a [[patrol]], as the leader. These are referred to as “patrol captains” to avoid confusion.

=== Raids ===
{{main|Raid}}
{{IN|java}}, one raid captain spawns in each wave during a raid. They usually spawn within a group of pillagers, and sometimes spawns riding a [[ravager]]. When its ominous banner is dropped, other illagers rush and attempt to pick it up to become the new raid captain.

{{IN|bedrock}}, raid captains are unused and do not spawn naturally during raids, but the code for them is present.{{verify|If this refers to the illager_captain coding in the vanilla behavior pack pillager and vindicator files, I think that actually is used for captains that spawn at outposts, and is not relevant to raids at all.}}

=== Pillager outposts ===
{{main|Pillager Outpost#Spawning}}
Pillager raid captains regularly spawn in a pillager outpost. Every pillager spawned has a small chance to be a raid captain.

{{IN|java}}, only pillagers and passive [[mobs]] may spawn within a pillager outpost spawn area.  Pillagers may spawn on any valid [[Opacity|opaque]] block as long as the block [[light]] level is 8 or lower.

== Drops ==
=== General ===
Upon death, a raid captain can drop:
* 1 [[File:Illager Banner.png|x16px]] [[Ominous banner]], unaffected by [[Looting]] and is always dropped.
* 1 {{ItemLink|Ominous Bottle}}, unaffected by [[Looting]] of a random level from 1-5. Raid captains that are within 96 blocks of a raid do not drop ominous bottles.

==== Pillager ====
* 0&ndash;2 {{ItemLink|arrow|arrows}}, dropping more with the presence of [[Looting]], up to 5{{only|bedrock}}. 
* Its {{ItemLink|crossbow}} (may be loaded or unloaded), which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and may be enchanted.

==== Vindicator ====
* 0&ndash;1 {{ItemLink|emerald|text=emeralds}}, with the maximum increasing by 1 for every level of [[Looting]]. 
* Its {{ItemLink|iron axe|link=Axe}}, which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and may be enchanted.

==== Evoker ====
* 1 {{ItemLink|totem of undying}}, unaffected by Looting.
* 0&ndash;1 {{ItemLink|emerald|emeralds}} if killed by the player, with the maximum increased by 1 per level of Looting.

==== Illusioner ====
* Its {{ItemLink|bow}}, which has an 8.5% chance to be dropped (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It has a random durability and is unenchanted.

=== Raider ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, raid captains that spawn from raids can additionally drop:
* 0&ndash;1 {{ItemLink|emerald|emeralds}}
An additional drop is dependent on difficulty, with a 65% chance of dropping on easy and normal, and an 80% chance of dropping on hard.<br>
They can drop one of the following items:
* 0&ndash;1 {{ItemLink|Emerald}} ({{frac|10|39}} chance) <!-- or {{frac|20|78}}-->
* 2&ndash;3 {{ItemLink|Emerald}} ({{frac|5|39}} chance) <!-- or {{frac|10|78}}-->
* 4&ndash;5 {{ItemLink|Emerald}} ({{frac|2|39}} chance) <!-- or {{frac|4|78}}-->
* 1 {{ItemLink|Enchanted Book}} ({{frac|2|39}} chance) <!-- or {{frac|4|78}} -->
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Pickaxe}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance)
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Axe}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance) 
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance) 
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Sword}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance) 
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Helmet}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance) 
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Chestplate}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance)
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Leggings}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance)
* 1 {{ItemLink|Iron Boots}} ({{frac|5|78}} chance)
Note:
* Raiders drop iron equipment in a damaged state, and the equipment has 50% chance of being enchanted with random enchantment.
* These drops are also affected by [[Looting]] enchantment.
* An emerald is both a regular raider drop and an additional raider drop.{{only|bedrock}}

== Behavior ==
Raid captains usually act the same as if they were a normal [[illager]], but other illagers follow behind them (except for outpost captain), and usually the captain takes the lead ahead of the other illagers. Once a raid captain is killed by a player, an [[ominous bottle]] is dropped that if drank, grant [[Bad Omen]], which can be used to start [[ominous event]]s like [[raid]]s or [[ominous trial]]s. The captain also drops its [[File:Illager Banner.png|x16px]] [[ominous banner]] as well; another illager nearby can pick it up to become the next captain.
