{{about|the rendering mechanic|items used to apply color to others|Dye|other uses}}

'''Colors''' are applied to several [[block]]s, [[item]]s and [[particle]]s in order to display a much wider array of possibilities than would be possible with a raw unmodified texture without the need for potentially millions of distinct files.

== Texture colors ==
While most objects directly use colors from the RGBA color [[Textures|texture]] map, some parts of textures are tinted with specific variable colors. Tinted textures are created by taking the base texture and [[wikipedia:Blend_modes#Multiply|multiplying]] it with the given tint, such as the biome color.

== Block and fluid colors ==
{{main|Block colors}}

=== Grass ===
The following blocks are counted as part of the "grass" group of blocks, and are accordingly colored:
*{{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Short Grass}}
*{{BlockLink|Tall Grass}}
*{{BlockLink|Fern}}
*{{BlockLink|Large Fern}}
*{{BlockLink|Bush}}
*{{BlockLink|Potted Fern}}
*{{BlockLink|Sugar Cane}}
*{{BlockLink|Pink Petals}} (stem only)
*{{BlockLink|Wildflowers}} (stem only)

Grass colors are biome-dependent, and the colors used are usually picked from a dedicated grass colormap, with some exceptions.

The following removed blocks (many unintended) also utilized the grass colors (full lists of renders can be found [[Block colors/Removed blocks and biomes#Potted grass blocks, grass and green shrubs|here]] and [[Block colors/Removed blocks and biomes#Green shrubs|here]]):
*{{BlockLink|id=shrub-inv|Green Shrub}}
*{{BlockLink|id=potted shrub-inv|Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Green Shrub}}
*{{BlockLink|Potted Grass|link=Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots}}
*{{BlockLink|Potted Grass Block|link=Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots}}

=== Foliage ===
The following blocks are counted as part of the "foliage" group of blocks, and are accordingly colored:
* {{BlockLink|Oak Leaves}}
* {{BlockLink|Jungle Leaves}}
* {{BlockLink|Acacia Leaves}}
* {{BlockLink|Dark Oak Leaves}}
* {{BlockLink|Mangrove Leaves}}
* {{BlockLink|Vines}}

Foliage colors are biome-dependent, and the colors used are usually picked from a dedicated foliage colormap, with some exceptions.

The following removed blocks (many unintended) also utilized the foliage colors (a full list of renders can be found [[Block colors/Removed blocks and biomes#Potted leaves and vines|here]]):
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Oak Leaves]]
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Birch Leaves]]
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Spruce Leaves]]
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Jungle Leaves]]
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Acacia Leaves]]
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Dark Oak Leaves]]
* [[Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots|Potted Vines]]

=== Dry foliage ===
One block is counted as part of the "dry foliage" group, colored in different tints of brown based on the biome.

* {{BlockLink|Leaf Litter}}

=== Water ===
Water placed in the world is also subject to coloring. {{iN|JE}}, this also applies to cauldrons.
*{{BlockLink|Water}}
*{{BlockLink|Water Cauldron}}

Unlike grass and foliage, water colors are always predefined, and are never picked from a colormap, even though [[History of textures/Unused textures#watercolor.png|one used to exist]].

=== Stems ===
Unlike other crops, [[pumpkin stem]]s and [[melon stem]]s utilize a color system which applies a different color for each growth stage.
*{{BlockLink|Pumpkin Stem|link=Pumpkin Seeds}}
*{{BlockLink|Melon Stem|link=Melon Seeds}}

=== Redstone wire ===
[[Redstone wire]] uses a color system which colors the wire depending on its current power level. With no power, it appears as a very dark red, whereas it appears bright red at full power.
*{{BlockLink|Redstone Dust|Redstone Wire}}

=== Cauldrons ===
{{Exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
Potions placed in cauldrons also use colors to represent the contained potion.{{Info needed|What colors exactly?}}

[[Water]] in cauldrons can be [[Dye|dyed]] similar to [[leather armor]].

=== Constant colors ===
A small subclass of blocks use colors which do not change at all under any circumstances.

* {{BlockLink|Birch Leaves}}: {{Color|#80A755}}
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Leaves}}: {{Color|#619961}}
* {{BlockLink|Lily Pad}}: {{Color|#208030}}
* {{BlockLink|Attached Melon Stem}}: {{Color|#E0C71C}}
* {{BlockLink|Attached Pumpkin Stem}}: {{Color|#E0C71C}}

The following removed block (many unintended) also used a constant color (a full list of renders can be found [[Block colors/Removed blocks and biomes#Potted leaves and vines|here]]):

* {{BlockLink|Potted Lily Pad|link=Java Edition removed blocks/Data variants#Incorrect blocks in flower pots}}

== Items ==
{{main|Item colors}}{{Empty section|Add a list of affected items}}

== Entities ==
{{Main|Miscellaneous colors}}

=== Dyed sheep ===
{{main|Sheep#Color values}}[[Sheep]] can be dyed, which changes the color of its wool with unique colors.

=== Wolf and cat collar ===

Both wolf and cat collars use the [[Dye#Color values|dye colors]] directly one to one.

=== Experience orbs ===
[[Experience orb]] textures are mostly white, gray, and red; a gradient is applied afterward to make them green and yellow.

=== Other ===
==== Particles ====
Alongside potion particles, several other [[particle]]s are stored as gray textures with colors applied to them after the fact. Notable examples are the various dripping particles (water, lava, honey, crying obsidian, spore blossom), critical hit (which has a white texture but an orange color is later applied), and magic crit (same).

Note blocks also emit particles, whose base texture is gray, that change color through the spectrum.

Commands can be used to set the colors of some but not all particles.

==== Banners ====

Banners are colored according to default [[Dye#Color values|dye colors]].

==== Beacon beam ====

Beacon beams are colored according to default [[Dye#Color values|dye colors]]. Without any stained glass, it defaults to the color for white dye.

==== End gateway beam ====
{{for|the colors applied to end gateway beams|Miscellaneous colors#End Gateway beam}}
The [[end gateway]] creates a beam under certain circumstances which is colored different colors depending on why said beam is created.

==== Guardian beam ====
{{for|the colors applied to guardian beams|Miscellaneous colors#Guardian beam}}
When attacking, [[guardian]]s shoot a ranged beam which follows a gradient dependent on time.

==== Light colors ====
When the "Render Dragon Features for Creators" [[Experiments|experiment]] is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', and [[Vibrant Visuals]] is enabled, all [[light]]-emitting blocks render colored lighting on the surrounding blocks. Furthermore, if point lights are enabled, some light blocks have point lighting, which is a directional light source with the same colors applied.

==== Sky and clouds ====
{{IN|BE}}, the [[sky]] and [[clouds]] have predefined colors for rainfall, thunderstorms and lightning strikes, which are blended with a specified weight with regular biome colors.

==== World border ====
{{for|the colors applied to the world border|Miscellaneous colors#World border}}
The [[world border]] {{in|JE}} has several colors. A blue color is applied if the border is stationary. If expanding, the world border takes on a green hue. If the world border is shrinking, the world border turns red. In the Nether, the world border is always red no matter if it is expanding, stationary, or shrinking. The world border becomes more opaque the closer the player is to it, and more transparent if the player is further away.

== Biome colors ==
{{Main|Biome#Tint}}{{for|renders of blocks with the biome colors applied|Block colors}}The temperature and downfall values of a [[biome]] are used when determining the colors of grass, foliage, dry foliage, water, [[fog]], and the [[sky]]. Blocks such as [[mossy cobblestone]], [[mossy stone bricks]], and the stems of most [[flower]]s are not affected by biome coloration.<ref>{{bug|MC-128784|Stems of flowers and moss on mossy cobblestone/stone bricks unaffected by biome coloring|Invalid}}</ref> {{IN|BE}}, biome colors are also visible on [[map]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-130658}}</ref>

=== Plants ===
Most biomes color blocks based on colormaps. The exact color used depends on the biome's temperature and downfall values, on the X and Y axis respectively.

At borders between or among biomes, the colors of the block and its eight{{verify|is this the default in Java, or is this outdated information due to the higher default value of Biome Blend? and are 3D neighbours taken into account?}} neighbors are computed and the average is used for the final block color.

<gallery heights="128">
File:Grasscolor.png|grass.png
File:Foliage.png|foliage.png
File:Dry foliage.png|dry_foliage.png This is used to color [[leaf litter]].
</gallery>Certain biomes use unique colors, overriding the temperature-based colors.

* Grass in [[swamps]] and [[mangrove swamps]] uses two different colors depending on the temperature inside the swamps, which is affected by a [[w:Perlin_noise|Perlin noise function]]. This is {{color|#4C763C}} below &minus;0.1, and {{color|#6A7039}}. {{IN|BE}}, a [[:File:Swamp grass.png|colormap]] is used for this.
* Foliage in swamps is always colored {{color|#6A7039}}, determined by a [[:File:Swamp foliage.png|colormap]] {{In|be}}.
* Foliage in mangrove swamps is always colored {{Color|#8db127}}, determined by a [[:File:Mangrove swamp foliage.png|colormap]] {{In|be}}.
* [[Dark Forest|Dark forests]] use the same grass colors as in other biomes, but are [[w:Mask_(computing)|bit masked]] with the number #FEFEFE, and averaged with a dark green color ({{color|#28340A}}) to produce the final color. In vanilla, the color therefore used is {{color|#507A32}}.
* [[Leaf Litter|Leaf litter]] in swamps, mangrove swamps, and dark forests uses color code {{color|#7B5334}}.
* [[Pale garden]]s use color value {{color|#778272}} for its grass, use color value {{color|#878D76}} for foliage and use color value {{color|#A0A69C}} for the leaf litter.
* All [[badlands]] biomes use {{color|#90814D}} for grass and {{color|#9E814D}} for foliage and dry foliage.
* [[Cherry grove]]s use color value {{color|#B6DB61}} for foliage and grass.

=== Water ===
[[Water]] and [[Water cauldron|water cauldrons]] placed in the world are subject to coloring. {{IN|je}}, unique water colors are used for different [[ocean]] temperatures, [[swamps]], [[pale gardens]], and a few other biomes. {{IN|BE}}, every biome has unique colors, even different [[dimensions]]. These are also visible on [[maps]]. Some biomes also have custom transparencies for water surface colors.

Water [[fog]] is colored accordingly to the water surface per biome, with slightly different colors and strengths.

=== Sky ===
The [[sky]] in the [[Overworld]] has variying shades of blue based on the temperature. Pale gardens override this with {{color|#B9B9B9}}, and End biomes placed in the Overworld have black sky colors. {{IN|je}}, each biome has unique colors during rainfall and thunder.

=== Fog ===
[[Fog]] has several colors, which are dependent of the fog type and the biome.

* Sky fog in the [[Overworld]] is {{Color|#c0d8ff}} {{In|je}} and {{Color|#abd2ff}} {{In|be}}.
* Sky fog in the [[End]] is {{Color|#a080a0}} in ''Java Edition'' and {{Color|#0b080c}} in ''Bedrock Edition''.
* Sky fog in [[pale gardens]] is {{Color|#817770}}.
* [[Weather]] fog is {{Color|#666666}}, or {{Color|#403C44}} in pale gardens.{{Only|be}}
* Fog in the [[Nether]] uses custom colors depending on the [[biome]].
* [[Water]] fog has unique colors for every biome.
* Lava fog is colored {{Color|#991A00}}.
* Powder snow fog is colored {{Color|#9FBBC8}}.
