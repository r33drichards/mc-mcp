'''Sam''' is the protagonist of the [[Mobs of Minecraft]] series of children's books, appearing in every installment. An avid explorer, they go on many adventures and always end up meeting a [[mob]] they'd never seen before.

== Appearance ==
Sam is a humanoid figure, with slightly messy brown hair, warm skin, and a yellow shirt with orange cuffs. Their pants are teal, resembling jeans, with spikey or torn cuffs, yellow socks, and black shoes.

== Personality ==
Sam is a very brave and curious adventurer who travels to many different biomes across the Overworld. They regularly run into problems, and in order to get out of them behave observant and cleverly, learning many lessons along the way.

== Biography ==
At some point, Sam fell victim to a [[creeper]], who blew up their campground. They decide to get prepared for further attacks, but grow too curious and venture back into the dark of the [[forest]]. Ultimately, they are able to defeat the creeper, and develop a desire to kill more, before going to a village and taming a [[cat]]. The cat comes in handy as more creepers spawn, before an encounter with a [[skeleton]] leads to them discovering [[music discs]], crafting a [[jukebox]] with a disc recovered from a creeper.

Skeletons would become a problem again later, as Sam worked to spelunk, discovering a [[monster room]]. Sam is able to escape by going into sunlight. They decide to get prepared for further attacks, crafting [[iron armor]] and a [[shield]], before getting found by [[strays]] and building an observation tower. At another time, Sam discovers a [[Skeleton Horse Trap|skeleton horse trap]], and has to get back to the tower, before defeating the horsemen. Using the items they acquired over the prior adventures, they return to the dungeon and defeat the skeletons.

Another day still, Sam sets off from camp with high ambitions. They identify a [[mushroom island]] from its "[[Huge mushroom|trees]]," and is amazed by the mysteries it holds. After spending a night there, they take a [[mooshroom]] home, and discover it turns brown when hit by [[lightning]]. An unknown amount of time later, they discovered an [[ocean monument]], claiming many items such as [[Pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]] and a [[wet sponge]].

Sam's next adventure begins in the [[windswept hills]], where they unwittingly discover a [[snow golem]]. Taking it home, they protect the golem from the [[rain]] and [[lava]], amazed by its many abilities. Suddenly, it throws a snowball at Sam, confusing them. They realize it's protecting them from a creeper, and are delighted to have a bodyguard. On another day, they encountered an [[enderman]], finding it very disturbing. After some trial and error they claim several [[ender pearls]], becoming hooked on their mystery. Later, Sam discovered [[bees]] in a [[cherry grove]], and figured out how to farm [[honeycombs]].
