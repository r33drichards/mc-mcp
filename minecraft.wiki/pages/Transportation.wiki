'''Transportation''' is how players move around the world or between [[dimension]]s (the [[Overworld]], [[the Nether]], and [[the End]]).
== Methods ==
{{missing info|section|horse/donkey/mule/camel swimming speed; nautilus dash speed}}
These speeds assume that the form of transportation is not under the effect of the [[Speed]] or [[Slowness]] status effects if they can be, unless mentioned. {{IN|be}}, there is a speed limit of 320 m/s, or 16 blocks per tick.

'''Note:''' As 1 block is 1 m<sup>3</sup>, 1 m/s is equal to 1 block per second. Thus for convenience, all speeds are shown in SI units. 1 m/s equals 3.28 ft/s and 1 km/h equals 0.621 mph.

;Notes
{{notelist}}

=== Potions ===
Using [[effect]]s from [[potion]]s or [[beacon]]s, walking and sprinting speeds become competitive with other methods of transportation.

Each additional level of {{EffectLink|Speed}} allows the player to walk at nearly the sprinting speed of the previous level, and sprinting with Speed II is only slightly slower than a minecart at full speed or a boosted [[pig]]. With adequate food and potion supplies, sprinting may be more cost-effective than building high-speed transportation systems.

Falling speed is [[Talk:Health#Falling Speed|more complex]]: Every tick ({{frac|1|20}} second), non-flying players and mobs have their vertical speed decremented (less upward motion, more downward motion) by 0.08 blocks per tick (1.6 m/s), then multiplied by 0.98.<ref group="note">Horses have their vertical speed multiplied by 0.98 a second time in the same tick. This may or may not apply to some other mobs.</ref> This can be described as a formula: 

<math>v(t) = 0.98 \times (v(t-1) - 0.08)</math>

Where <math>v(t)</math>is the speed (in blocks/second) at the <math>t</math>-th tick. <math>v(1)</math> corresponds to the initial speed of the jump: <math>v(1) = \begin{Bmatrix} 0 & \quad Free\;fall \\ 0.42 + 0.1E_{JumpBoost} & \quad Jumping \end{Bmatrix}</math> where <math>E_{JumpBoost}</math> is the level of the jump boost. Because "Speed" (in Minecraft) is defined as the Y coordinate difference between ''the current tick and the previous tick'', the initial speed is <math>v(1)</math> instead of <math>v(0)</math>.

This ''would'' produce a terminal velocity of 3.92 blocks per tick or 78.4 m/s. However, the sky isn't quite high enough for that: Falling from layer 320 to bedrock takes around 8 seconds, with impact at 3.70925 blocks per tick (74.185 m/s). It is possible to fly higher in Creative mode, or by flying with an elytra and then removing it, reaching terminal velocity by falling from "above the sky".
{{notelist}}

By solving the recurrence relation, it is possible to get an exact function to calculate the vertical speed of a falling player:

<math>v(t) = 0.98^{t-1}(v(1) + 3.92) - 3.92</math>

Where the velocity <math>v</math> is in blocks (meters) per tick, the time <math>t</math> is in ticks and downward motion is negative. Note that if the initial velocity is zero, the function can be simplified to <math>v(t) = 3.92 \times (0.98^t - 1)</math>.

An exact function to calculate the displacement of the player is the following:

<math>d(t) = d(0) + 50(v(1)+3.92)(1-0.98^{t}) - 3.92t</math>

Where the displacement <math>d</math> is in blocks (meters), the time <math>t</math> is in ticks, <math>d(0)</math> is the initial displacement and downward displacement is negative. If the initial velocity and displacement is zero, it can be written as:

<math>d(t) = 3.92 \times (50 \times  (1 - 0.98^t) - t)</math>

An approximate function to calculate the time it takes to fall from some height is the following:

<math>t(d) = 50 + 0.255102d + 49.498316 \times W_{0}(-0.367861 \times 0.994859^d)</math>

Where the height <math>d</math> is in blocks (meters), the time <math>t</math> is in ticks, initial velocity and displacement is zero, downward displacement is negative and <math>W</math> is the [[wikipedia:Lambert W function|Lambert W function]].

=== Other modes of transportation ===
*Players are also able to use [[piston]]s for transport.
**It is possible to construct [[Tutorial:Flying machines|complex flying machines]] using pistons, [[blocks of redstone]], [[slime block]]s, and [[honey block]]s.
*[[Dying]] is an instant mode of transportation to the player's [[bed]] or [[World spawn#Individual spawn|spawn]] point, but at the cost of all items and XP (if the <code>keepInventory</code> gamerule is disabled) and the world (on Hardcore).
**If the player has already defeated the [[ender dragon]], and is near a [[stronghold]]/[[end portal]], they can enter and exit [[the End]] to instantly be transported to their bed or spawn point without dying.
*[[Explosion]] knockback can send an adjacent player flying for a short distance, depending on the strength of the explosion. This is not recommended in [[Survival mode]] without strong [[armor]] and/or a [[totem of undying]].
** Due to how damage is calculated after explosion knockback, you can’t take damage if you make the player cannon powerful enough.{{verify}}
*It is possible to position [[boat]]s in a line with each boat being 4-5 blocks (inclusive) from each other. By rapidly pressing the {{control|interact}} button. This also works with saddled [[pig]]s (provided they stay in position. (placed on posts)) and [[minecart]]s, however those are much more expensive.
