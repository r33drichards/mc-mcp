[[File:New UI - Settings Screen Menu (Bedrock Preview 26.0.28).png|thumb|New settings UI, based on [[Ore UI]].{{upcoming}}]]
''Minecraft's'' user environment can be configured through the '''Settings''' menus. A few additional options can be changed only by editing the [[options.txt]] file manually.

The settings menus can be accessed from both the [[main menu]] and the [[pause menu]]. The "Storage" and "Language" settings tabs are not available from the pause menu, and some options are only changeable in the main menu or the pause menu. For the settings tabs related to game settings in the pause menu, see {{Slink|World Options|Classic UI}}.

In ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', options menus are gradually updated with an [[Ore UI]] design preview which is likely to be included in the base game in a future update.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/36960637452557|title=Let’s talk about our updated settings! (Bedrock)|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=September 1, 2025}}</ref> This adds some visual effects to the options menu, in-game descriptions, more categorization, and preview sounds for the audio tab. As of [[Bedrock Edition Preview 26.0.28|26.0.28]], the Accessibility, Keyboard & Mouse, General, Video, Audio, Account, and Language settings tabs have received the design preview as well as the tabs on the left.

| Render Distance
| The render distance controls how many chunks of the world are visible at once. The fewer chunks that are included, the faster each frame can be rendered, resulting in higher frames per second (FPS). This also affects the render distance of foliage such as transparent leaves, crops and animated textures. Available in 2-10 sections on the slider, ranging from 5-96 chunks maximum (depending on the device). The most distant terrain is faded by [[fog]], to avoid a sharp edge to the visible world. This slider is only available when the graphics mode is set to "Simple" or "Fancy".
The maximum render distance available on the slider depends on the device.
