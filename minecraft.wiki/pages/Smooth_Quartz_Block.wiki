A '''smooth quartz block''' is a mineral [[block]] used only for decoration. It is made by smelting [[blocks of quartz]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Smooth quartz blocks can be [[breaking|mined]] using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it [[drops]] nothing.

Despite regular blocks of quartz having hardness and blast resistances of 0.8, smooth quartz has a blast resistance of 6 and hardness of 2. This is likely due to historical reasons, specifically as a result of hardness being inherited from slab blocks.<ref>{{bug|MC-53641}}</ref>

=== Natural generation ===
2 smooth quartz blocks generate naturally as part of each bridge [[bastion remnant]].

=== Note Blocks ===
Smooth quartz blocks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Issues ==

== Trivia ==

* Because of the low blast resistance of regular quartz blocks, it may be preferable to use two quartz slabs or smooth quartz blocks when making fortifications using quartz, as their blast resistance is higher than the other quartz block variants.
