'''1.3.1''' is a major update to {{JE}} released on August 1, 2012,<ref name=1.3/> which added [[trading]], [[Adventure]] mode, new generated structures ([[Jungle pyramid|jungle]] and [[desert pyramid]]s), and new blocks/items including [[emerald]]s, [[book and quill]]s, [[written book]]s, and [[tripwire]]. It also adds [[ender chest]]s, improved [[enchanting]], and splits the [[Creative inventory]] into separate sections. This is the first version to use an internal [[multiplayer]] server in [[singleplayer]] worlds, which resulted in [[/List of broken features|many broken features]]. While it was not the only 1.3 release, it was the only one before the snapshots of [[Java Edition 1.4.2|1.4.2]] started.

A pre-release for 1.3.1 was released on July 30, 2012,<ref name=1.3>{{cite|url=https://www.mojang.com/2012/07/the-weekly-chunk-minecraft-1-3-prerelease/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730234444/http://www.mojang.com/2012/07/the-weekly-chunk-minecraft-1-3-prerelease/|title=The Weekly Chunk: Minecraft 1.3 Prerelease|author=Jens Bergensten|website=Mojang.com|date=July 30, 2012}}</ref> though the full release of 1.3.1 is identical to this pre-release.

The old <code>nogui</code> argument still works for backward compatibility.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Truncated coordinates to 5 fractional digits.

=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* The particles from adding an [[eye of ender]] to an [[end portal frame]] block no longer appear offset if performed at high distances from the world origin.
** This is due to the fact that they simply did not appear at all from this snapshot onwards, which is {{bug|MC-10369|another bug entirely.}}

== Trivia ==
* 1.3 was a version that held several development-related records, until the development of [[Java Edition 1.8]].
** The most snapshots for a major release: 19.
** The longest development period, from first snapshot to final release: 111 days.
** The longest wait between major releases, with a release 153 days after the release of [[Java Edition 1.2.1]] (later broken by the wait time between Java Edition 1.8 and [[Java Edition 1.9]]).
* If the player changed their skin after Java Edition 1.8 was released, 1.3.1 would be the oldest version to display that skin change. If the player plays on [[Java Edition 1.2.5]] or older versions they still see the last skin they used before Java Edition 1.8.
* 1.3 is the last major update to {{JE}} without an official name and promotional image.
* 1.3.1 has the same amount of snapshots as [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]].
