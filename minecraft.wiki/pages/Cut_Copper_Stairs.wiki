'''Cut copper stairs''' are a [[cut copper]] variant of [[stairs]]. Unlike other types of stairs, cut copper stairs can oxidize over time.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cut copper stairs can be broken with [[stone pickaxe]]s or higher. If mined without a [[pickaxe]], they drop nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Waxed oxidized cut copper stairs generate naturally in [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
{{for|information about the placement mechanics of all stairs|Stairs#Usage}}

=== Oxidation ===
{{main|Oxidation}}
Non-waxed cut copper stairs have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state). [[Lightning bolt]]s and [[axe]]s can remove the oxidation on cut copper stairs. They can be waxed with a [[honeycomb]] to prevent it from oxidizing.

As the block begins to oxidize (exposed), it gets discolored and green spots begin to appear. As the oxidation continues (weathered), the block is a green color with brown spots. In the last stage (oxidized), the block is teal with several green spots.
