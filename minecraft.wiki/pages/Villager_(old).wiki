'''Villagers''' are [[passive]] [[mob]]s that inhabit [[Village/Structure (old)|villages]], work at their professions, breed, and interact with each other. Their clothing varies according to their occupation. A [[player]] can [[trade]] with villagers, using [[emerald]]s as currency. Villagers received a [[Villager|complete overhaul]] of both their appearance and their functionality in the [[Village & Pillage]] update; this page covers villagers as they appeared and behaved before the update.

== Spawning ==

=== Spawn eggs ===
{{IN|be}}, the old villager spawn egg can still be obtained by {{cmd|give @s spawn_egg 1 15}}, but it spawns a new villager instead.

=== Natural generation ===

{{IN|Java}}, old villagers can only spawn in versions of Minecraft prior to 1.14. {{IN|Bedrock}}, old villagers can only spawn if they existed from a template world prior to [[Bedrock Edition 1.11.0|1.11.0]], and any old villager spawned after 1.11.0 outside a template world is converted into [[villager|villager_v2]].

=== Baby villagers ===

Villagers breed autonomously, but need doors and need to be willing in order to spawn baby villagers. After exactly 20 minutes during which the baby villager is within render distance, the baby villager grows up to an adult. See [[#Breeding|this section]] for more information.

=== Curing ===

Villagers spawn if a player uses a [[splash potion]] of [[weakness]] on a [[Zombie Villager (old)|v1 zombie villager]] in template world<!-- curing v1 zombie villager in non-template world converts it to villager_v2--> and then feeds it a regular [[golden apple]]. It then shakes and turn into a villager within 0-5 minutes. During the change, the zombie villager can still burn in the sun.

== Drops ==

Villagers [[drop]] nothing upon [[death]].

'''Trade:''' 3–6 xp
'''Trade while willing:''' 8–11 xp

== Behavior ==

=== Movement patterns ===
Upon spawning, villagers leave their homes and begin to explore the village. Generally, they wander aimlessly inside the village during the day. They may go indoors or outdoors, and they periodically make mumbling sounds. Occasionally, two villagers may stop and turn to look at each other, in a behavior called socializing, in which they stare at another villager for 4-5 seconds at a time. In the case of players, they continuously stare at them as long as the player is close enough, unless the villager tries to get into a house at night, farm food, or flee from a zombie.

In [[Legacy Console Edition]], when a player attacks a villager, the villager does not run away, but anger particles fly out from the villager if it is in a village. {{IN|be}}, villagers do not stop continuously in front of players. They also [[sprint]] away if the player attacks them.

Villagers, like other mobs, find paths around obstructions, avoiding walking off cliffs and some blocks that cause harm. However, in crowded situations it is possible for one villager to push another off a cliff or into harm. Villagers also occasionally walk off of ledges high enough to cause fall damage.

At night or during rain, villagers run inside, closing doors behind them, and staying indoors until morning. In the morning they head outside and resume normal behavior.

Villagers flee from [[zombie]]s, [[illager]]s and [[vex]]es within 8 blocks.

If a villager finds itself outside the village boundary, or a villager without a village detects a village boundary within 32 blocks, it moves quickly back within the boundary. A villager taken more than 32 blocks away from its village boundary forgets the village within about 6 seconds. Whether in a village or not, a villager is never prone to [[despawn]]ing.

Villagers cannot open [[trapdoor]]s, [[fence gate]]s, or [[iron door]]s.

There is evidence that villagers are prone to overcrowding certain areas of a village while leaving other areas completely empty. When moving inside, the AI prefers doors within 16 blocks (Euclidean distance). It also tends to prefer doors with fewer villagers nearby, however "nearby" in this case is only 1.5 blocks and, when moving inside, villagers prefer to move 2.5 blocks inside when the inside is to the south or east and therefore go out of range of this check. During the day, it has been observed that villagers tend to cluster near a trapped villager or any existing large cluster of villagers, likely due to the "socialize" AI routine overriding their inclination to wander.

=== Picking up items ===

Villagers have eight hidden inventory slots, which start empty whenever the villager is spawned. Villagers do not intentionally seek out items to pick up, but they collect any [[bread]], [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[wheat]], [[seeds]], [[beetroot]] and [[beetroot seeds]] they happen to come within range of. These are the only items they are able to pick up, though the player may use the {{cmd|replaceitem}} command to put an arbitrary item into a villager's inventory. If a player and a villager are in the pickup range of an item at the same time, the player always picks it up first.

Even when {{cd|gamerule keepInventory}} is set to {{cd|false}}, villagers that are killed with any of the available items above do not drop them once they are killed.

Any items in these slots are lost if a villager becomes a zombie villager; a zombie villager has no inventory slots.

If {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is <code>false</code>, villagers do not pick up items.

A dispenser can be used, if adjacent to a villager, to place armor on it. While not visible in most cases (other than pumpkins and mob heads) the equipment is fully functional; for example, the [[Thorns]] enchantment hurts zombies that attack a villager with a piece of armor enchanted with the Thorns enchantment equipped.

=== Sharing food ===

If a villager has enough food in one inventory stack (6 [[bread]] or 24 [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[beetroot]]s, or 18 [[wheat]] for farmers only) and sees a villager without enough food in one inventory stack (3 bread or 12 carrots, potatoes or beetroot for non-farmers; 15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat for Farmers), the villager may decide to share food with that villager.

To share, a villager finds its first inventory stack with at least 4 bread, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot or with at least 6 wheat, and then throws half the stack (rounded down) in the direction of the target villager. When wheat is shared, it is first crafted to bread which may result in 1 or 2 less than half the stack being shared.

=== Farming ===

Adult and baby brown-robed villagers, both farmers and other careers, tend crops within the village boundary. Villagers far enough outside the boundary of ''any'' village also tend nearby crops.

Farmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 15 blocks away from the villager in X and Z and up to 1 away in Y (a 31×31×3 area total).
* If a brown-robed villager does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes or beetroot, it moves to the crop block and break it.
* If a brown-robed villager has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in its inventory and finds an air block above farmland, it moves to it and plant a crop. They always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.
* If {{cmd|/gamerule mobGriefing}} is <code>false</code>, villagers cannot farm.

=== Baby villager behavior ===
[[File:ChildrenTag (old).png|thumb|200px|A group of baby villagers playing a game of tag.]]

Baby villagers sprint around, entering and leaving houses randomly. They sometimes stop sprinting to stare at an [[iron golem]]. If the iron golem is holding a [[poppy]], it might attract any baby villagers near it.

Baby villagers in [[Bedrock Edition|Bedrock]]/[[Legacy Console Edition]]s have a slightly bigger head than in the {{el|je}}, this also can be seen in different baby mobs in the game as well.

Unlike other breed-able mobs, the parents and child have no personal interactions other than socializing.

=== Zombies ===
{{main|Siege|Zombie}}

[[Zombie]]s try to find and attack villagers within a 42 block radius (even when the villager is invisible), and attempt to break down [[door]]s. Zombies successfully break doors only if the difficulty is set to hard, although only a fraction of zombies spawned in Hard mode have the capacity to break doors. This also applies to zombie pigmen if they path find through a door. Villagers flee from zombies, sometimes hiding in houses. The villager's only "natural" defense are the [[iron golem]]s, which attack nearby hostile mobs. 

Zombies try to kill villagers, or convert them to [[Zombie Villager (old)|v1 zombie villager]]s. The chance for a villager to become a zombie villager on death is 0% on Easy, 50% on Normal, and 100% on Hard. Baby villagers can be infected by [[zombie]]s as well.

Villagers also flee from zombie pigmen, although the latter do not attack them.

[[Drowned]] chase and attack villagers in the same way as zombies, and villagers run from drowned in the same way they run from zombies. Drowned can also convert villagers to zombie villagers, even when attacking from a distance with a [[trident]].

=== Lightning ===

When [[lightning]] strikes within 3–4 blocks of a villager, it turns into a [[witch]].

== Breeding ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Legacy village mechanics}}

[[File:VillagerInLove (old).png|thumb|200px|Two villagers [[mating]].]]

Villagers mate depending on the number of valid [[door]]s. If "willing" (see below), villagers mate as long as the population is less than 35% ({{el|be}}: 100%) of valid doors, rounded down. The type of villager that spawns is independent of the villager's parents.

A valid door is any door within the village radius where the number of "outside" spaces within 5 blocks in a straight line on one side of the door is not the same as the number of "outside" spaces within 5 blocks on the other side of the door. A space is considered to be "outside" if it has nothing but transparent blocks above it all the way to the sky.

A census is periodically taken to determine the current population of the village. All villagers within the horizontal boundary of the village and within 5 vertical blocks ({{el|be}}: no apparent height limit) of the center is counted as part of the population to determine if continued villager mating is allowed. However, any villager within the horizontal boundary of the village and within the ''spherical'' boundary of the village attempts to enter mating mode as long as there is at least one villager within the boundary. If two villagers simultaneously enter mating mode while they are close to one another, they mate with each other and produce a child.

=== Willingness ===

Additionally, villagers must be "willing" in order to breed. After mating, they are no longer willing, and must be made willing again.

Villagers can become willing by having either 3 [[bread]], 12 [[carrot]]s, 12 [[potato]]es, or 12 [[beetroot]]s in one stack in their inventory. Any villager with an excess of food (usually farmers) throw food to other villagers, allowing them to pick it up and obtain enough food to become willing. The player can also throw bread, carrots, beetroots, or potatoes at the villagers themselves to encourage breeding. Villagers consume the required food upon becoming willing. 

Villagers may also become willing when the player trades with them. Willingness is granted the first time a new offer is traded, or at a one-in-five chance on subsequent trades. Most of the time, villagers becomes willing after the second or third trade. Green particles appear if the villager becomes willing by trading. This does not cause them to immediately seek out a mate, however.

Before [[Java Edition 1.8]], willingness was not implemented. The only factor needed is enough valid doors.

== Professions and careers ==
{{missing info|section=1|Bedrock-specific textures for careers}}

Each villager has a profession, which can be identified by their clothing. Villagers also have careers specific to their profession. The player can identify a villager's career by reading the title at the top of the trading interface.

Below is a table listing the various villagers, with their careers in relation to their professions, as well as the IDs specifying these. While each profession has a 1 in 6 chance (16.67%) of occurring, the probabilities for individual careers to occur are more diversified. They are listed in the table as well.

When a villager is transformed into a zombie villager, the profession of the zombie villager remains unchanged. However, the career is reset and randomly picked again if the zombie villager is cured, allowing for the player to get a villager with a new career and new trade offers. Old trade offers disappear, even if the same career is chosen again.

=== Nitwit ===

{{quote|It started because players could summon villagers without a career by using commands: it was the only way to get villagers with green robes. Whenever we discover we have a bug which is used by the community we just see it as 'undefined behaviour' - and 'fix' it by making it a feature. In this case we just needed a profession for the green-robed villager. I don't remember what name we came up with first - I think it was 'unemployed' or something, but it doesn't really fit in the world, because I don't really think the other villagers are employed by anyone either. So I think the next suggestion was 'village idiot' but I thought 'nitwit' was a more fun name.|[[Jeb]] about the Nitwit<ref name="meet-nitwit">{{Mcnet|meet-nitwit|Meet the Nitwit|January 23, 2017}}</ref>||Jens Bergensten Mojang avatar.png}}

The nitwit villager is a villager that wears a green robe and cannot be [[traded]] with.

== Trading ==
{{main|Trading/Before Village and Pillage}}
[[File:Trading paper clean GUI.png|thumb|The pre-1.14 trading interface displaying a trade of 28 [[paper]] for 1 [[emerald]].]]
{{quote|Right click on a villager and you can trade with them, offering them emeralds in exchange for better equipment, maps to notable treasures or food. Unless you are trying to trade with a nitwit, of course, in which case you're going to get squat. Who's the nitwit now?|[[Marsh Davies]]<ref name="meet-villagers">{{Mcnet|meet-villagers|Meet the Villagers|March 13, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>||Marsh Davies Mojang avatar.png}}

The trading system is a [[gameplay]] mechanic that allows players to trade [[emerald]]s for [[items]] and vice-versa with villagers. Their trades can be good or bad, depending on what the cost is and what [[items]] you might get. Trading is only available for adult villagers; the player cannot trade with baby villagers or the nitwit villager.

Right-clicking a villager allows a player to trade with them, and display their career. Villagers make offers based on their profession and career, and trade based on whatever offers they are making. Different offers may be viewed by pressing the left and right buttons next to the currently displayed offer. All offers involve [[emerald]] as a currency, and some item pertinent to the villager's profession and career. Trading allows the acquisition of rare items that would otherwise be fairly difficult to obtain, such as chain [[armor]]. The trading mechanic allows players to get [[bottle o' enchanting]] in survival mode. When villagers get a new trade, pink particles and green cross particles appear.

After trading a new offer once, the villager allows a new tier of offers. After 2-12 times an offer is repeated, the villager locks the trade offer. That is, the villager no longer offers this trade. When this happens, the player must use another new trade offer in the villager's window once (or several times if it is already used once), and then wait for a short time. If green particles appear, all trades unlock. That is, the villager starts offering all trades. There is a maximum number of tiers each villager can possess, varying by career. Once the villager has unlocked all tiers, it does not open any new ones. However, players can still renew all offers by trading.

=== Regeneration ===
When a villager gives off particles from a new trade, they get 10 seconds of Regeneration I, which gives them {{hp|4}}.

Commands or external editors can help villagers get new trades. 

If a villager unintentionally picks up certain seeds or crops, it throws it to another villager to simulate trading between the villagers.

=== Entity data ===

{{see also|Chunk format}}
Villagers have entity data associated with them that contains various properties.

<section begin="entity data"/><div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} Entity data
** {{nbt inherit/entity}}
** {{nbt inherit/mob}}
** {{nbt inherit/breedable}}
** {{nbt|int|Profession}}: The [[Villager#Professions and careers|ID]] of the texture used for this villager. This also influences trading options.
** {{nbt|int|Riches}}: Currently unused. Increases by the number of emeralds traded to a villager any time they are traded.
** {{nbt|int|Career}}: The [[Villager#Professions and careers|ID]] of this villager's career. This also influences trading options and the villager's name in the GUI (if it does not have a CustomName). If 0, the next time offers are refreshed, the game assigns a new Career and resets CareerLevel to 1.
** {{nbt|int|CareerLevel}}: The current level of this villager's trading options. Influences the trading options generated by the villager; if it is greater than their career's maximum level, no new offers are generated. Increments when a trade causes offers to be refreshed. If 0, the next trade to do this assigns a new Career and sets CareerLevel to 1. Set to a high enough level causes no new trades to release (Career must be set to 1 or above).
** {{nbt|byte|Willing}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the villager is willing to mate. Becomes true after certain trades (those which would cause offers to be refreshed), and false after mating.
** {{nbt|list|Inventory}}: Each compound tag in this list is an item in the villager's inventory, up to a maximum of 8 slots. Items in two or more slots that can be stacked together are automatically condensed into one slot. If there are more than 8 slots, the last slot is removed until the total is 8. If there are 9 slots but two previous slots can be condensed, the last slot remains after the two other slots are combined.
*** {{nbt|compound}} An item in the inventory, excluding the Slot tag.
**** {{nbt inherit/itemnoslot|indent=****}}
** {{nbt|compound|Offers}}: Is generated when the trading menu is opened for the first time.
*** {{nbt|list|Recipes}}: List of trade options.
**** {{nbt|compound}} A trade option.
***** {{nbt|byte|rewardExp}}: 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if this trade provides XP orb drops. All trades from naturally-generated villagers in Java Edition reward XP orbs.
***** {{nbt|int|maxUses}}: The maximum number of times this trade can be used before it is disabled. Increases by a random amount from 2 to 12 when offers are refreshed.
***** {{nbt|int|uses}}: The number of times this trade has been used. The trade becomes disabled when this is greater or equal to maxUses.

==Trivia== 
[[File:Old villagers, raid fail.png|thumb|right|A raid of illagers celebrating victory, despite having the old villagers and beds.]]
*By downloading worlds from the [[Marketplace]], old and new villagers can be summoned at the same place. Because old villagers don't count as villagers, any [[raid]] ends in defeat the moment all new villagers are killed, even if old villagers are still alive.
*The villagers were inspired by the shop keepers in [[wikipedia:Dungeon Master 2|Dungeon Master 2]].<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/xfzdg/i_am_markus_persson_aka_notch_creator_of/c5m0p26</ref>
*Originally, the mobs populating villages were to be [[pigmen]].<ref>{{tweet|notch|62531431175421952}}</ref>
*Villagers tend to often cram into houses that are in the southern-eastern area of their village.
*Name tags used on villagers always name the villager instead of opening the trading interface.
*Villagers can see invisible players.
*After a zombie villager is cured, the villager gets Nausea for 10 seconds (indicated by the purple status effect particles).
*When a villager is in love mode, it walks very slowly. However, when a villager runs indoors as the night falls, it runs extremely fast, even faster than the player's sprinting speed.
*The [[Horse Update]] release poster showed a blue-robed villager in the background. Such a villager has never been added to the main game, however a similar design is used for the Scared Villager in [[Caves & Cliffs Explorers]].
*The Priest, Librarian and Nitwit villagers have an unused hood in their textures.

===April fools ===
{{main|Easter eggs#2014}}

On April 1, 2014, Mojang announced that villagers have taken over the skin servers and content delivery networks (CDN) as an April Fools joke. This caused players' current skin to turn into villager skins. This also caused users to be unable to change their skins. Different career villager skins were used, including the then-unused nitwit villager (green robe).

Many of the sounds were also changed, supposedly by the villagers. They seem to be similar to a villager talking (with words, rather than their normal sounds). The in-game music has also been altered to include villager like noises, and also features a villager version of the "Game of Thrones" theme on the title screen. The sounds originate from the sound resource pack created by Element Animation, titled The Element Animation Villager Sound Resource Pack (T.E.A.V.S.R.P), which is based on the villagers appearing in their fan videos. The villagers were voiced by Dan Lloyd, Director of Element Animation.
