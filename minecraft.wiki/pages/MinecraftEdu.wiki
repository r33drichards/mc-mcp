'''''MinecraftEdu''''' is a discontinued mod for {{el|java}} developed by [http://teachergaming.com TeacherGaming], published by [http://elinemedia.com E-Line Media] and licensed by [[Mojang Studios]].<ref>https://help.mojang.com/customer/en/portal/articles/325947-where-can-i-buy-minecraft-</ref> It was intended to be an educational version of ''[[Minecraft]]''.

In the beginning, ''MinecraftEdu'' was developed by ''TeacherGaming'', consisting of three developers and three teachers, located in the United States and Finland. Later, ''TeacherGaming'' expanded into a team of eight.

''MinecraftEdu'' focuses on allowing the [[player]] to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated [[The Overworld|map]] made of {{w|Cubic metre|one-cubic-meter-sized}} [[blocks]]. In doing so, the student, with the help of the teacher, is intended to learn a variety of subjects. The teacher can change settings to define where students can place and destroy [[blocks]] and the [[world]] used on the server.

On January 19, 2016, Mojang announced that they would be acquiring ''MinecraftEdu'' from TeacherGaming. At the same time, a new educational version of the game was announced: ''Minecraft: Education Edition'' (later renamed to {{el|ee}}) has since launched to schools around the world.<ref>{{cite|url=https://hosting.teachergaming.com/education_edition|title=MinecraftEdu & Minecraft: Education Edition}}</ref><ref>{{Link|url=https://twitter.com/Kulttuuri/status/689442908294905856|title=We've been acquired|website=Twitter|date=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

== Purchase and availability ==

''MinecraftEdu'' could be purchased for {{w|United States dollar|US$}}18 per student (24 or less) or US$14 (25 or more) for the User license and US$41 for the server license. The server license could be bought as a one-time purchase. Once purchased, the game could be played by downloading the launcher. ''MinecraftEdu Hosting Beta'' was also available for US$20/month and did not require the user to pay the server software license again. In early 2016, ''MinecraftEdu Hosting'' exited beta and the price was increased US$25/month<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160119022444/http://minecraftedu.com:80/hosting</ref>. Despite ''MinecraftEdu's'' sunsetting by ''Mojang'' in early 2016, ''MinecraftEdu Hosting'' could still be purchased for this price until December 31st, 2017<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20180105154450/http://hosting.teachergaming.com/</ref>. Once their subscription ran out, the only way you could get a ''MinecraftEdu'' server was to self-host it.

=== Discontinuation ===

As of April 5, 2016, ''MinecraftEdu'' is no longer for sale. However, customers that have already purchased ''MinecraftEdu'' licenses may continue to use ''MinecraftEdu''. Since then, ''MinecraftEdu'' no longer receives new updates from TeacherGaming, and Mojang no longer supports ''MinecraftEdu''. Worlds built in ''MinecraftEdu'' cannot be ported over to ''[[Minecraft Education]]''<ref>{{tumblr|minecraftedu|142249320886/required-minecraftedu-update-and-other-changes}}</ref> because ''Minecraft Education'' is built on {{BE}}, not Java.

== Development ==
''MinecraftEdu'' development had continued on a daily basis with new changes and features since it first launched in 2011, until its discontinuation in 2016. All current and future updates were included in the cost. Changes to the software could be viewed on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160415173551/http://services.minecraftedu.com/wiki/Changelog Changelog page].

Aleksi Postari and Toni Paavola, two developers of ''MinecraftEdu,'' had a [https://mcedudev.tumblr.com/ development log] detailing the game's development.

=== History of ''MinecraftEdu'' ===
For a 2013 thesis<ref>https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/54002/Opinnaytetyo_Aleksi_Postari.pdf#page=26</ref>, Aleksi Postari made the following table (originally in Finnish), laying out the history of MinecraftEdu.

==Gameplay==

The objective of the game remains the same as regular {{MC}}, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. However, ''MinecraftEdu'' also has the goal of an educational use to teach a variety of subjects. 

=== Features ===
''MinecraftEdu'' differed from unmodified {{JE}} in a variety of ways, such as a tutorial mode, teacher [[options]] and exclusive [[blocks]] and [[items]].
