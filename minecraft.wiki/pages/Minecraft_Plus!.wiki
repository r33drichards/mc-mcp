'''Minecraft Plus!''' is a {{w|screensaver}} app developed by [[Mojang Studios]] for {{w|April Fools Day}} 2021. It features many different Minecraft-themed screensavers, using block and item textures from the game, inspired by screensavers from old computers. The app can either be downloaded for free on a 64-bit {{w|Microsoft Windows|Windows}} PC running Windows 7 or later, or used in a modern web browser.<ref>https://plus.minecraft.net</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|introducing-minecraft-plus|Introducing Minecraft Plus!|April 1, 2021}}</ref>

| Part of a quote from {{w|David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|Dr. David Bowman}} ("The thing's hollow—it goes on forever—and—oh my God—''it's full of stars!''") and his last line before being pulled through the monolith, from the novel ''{{w|2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey}}'' (while often attributed to the {{w|2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|film of the same name}}, the line does not actually appear on-screen until its sequel, ''{{w|2010 (film)|2010: The Year We Make Contact}}''). However, ''Minecraft'' is full of stars. They are square pixels on the screen that appear at [[Daylight cycle#Night|nighttime]].

== Trivia ==
* The box art is styled after the box of {{w|Microsoft Plus!#Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP|Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP}}, an enhancement package for the {{w|Windows XP}} operating system that included features such as desktop themes and screensavers. Since "Microsoft Plus!" and "Minecraft" are Microsoft branded IPs, Mojang Studios was able to use both the name and the style.
* While the MinecraftPlus.scr file ''can'' be run on UNIX based operating systems with Wine,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRXtVo5rccs Minecraft Plus: WINE Compatibility Test [Minecraft April Fools 2021<nowiki>]</nowiki>] by Toshnika on YouTube.</ref> the bulk of the app does not work, as Wine's functionality as a compatibility layer does not allow it to change the OS screensaver.
* The icon for Minecraft Plus! is a Glow Squid, which also appears as an animation before starting the browser version and in one of the screensavers. Since the screensaver featuring Glow Squids parodies "Flying Toasters", this may be a reference to how the Flying Toaster was After Dark's mascot.
* The download for Windows contains a zip file with a .scr file inside. If the .scr file refuses to run, its extension can be changed from .scr to .exe to run it.<ref>{{W|Screensaver}}, Wikipedia</ref> Note that this method can also work on other screensavers as well (including the default Windows screensavers). Renaming the .scr file to .exe then running the app will open in windowed mode rather than fullscreen mode.
* The app's file description, as shown on program lists, is "Minecraft Minus Players!".
* The screensaver contains models and textures for many blocks and items in the game up to [[Java Edition 21w13a]], as well as original and two-color creeper face textures.
* The web page supports two {{W|query string}}s:
** <code>autorun</code>, which automatically runs the screensaver if the <code>window</code> value is specified. If another value is specified then it just skips to the "run in fullscreen or windowed" page.
** <code>module</code>, which, when given a positive {{W|integer}}, forces a specific screensaver once the screensaver is run. Each screensaver's corresponding number is listed [[#Screensavers|above]]. It uses {{W|modulo}}, so numbers too high cycle back. Integers decreasing from zero follow the same order in reverse, beginning with "Glow squids" at -1, "Colored footsteps" at -2, etc. Numbers after a decimal point are ignored (truncated), and non-numbers default to 0.
* In the HTML code of plus.minecraft.net, there are three comments that read "I definitely wasn’t hired for my webdev skills haha", "What is this? Where are all the libraries? This is never going to work in IE" and "Is that written by hand? Puzzling!". The text "This is never going to work in IE" means that screensaver in browser does not work at all on {{w|Internet Explorer}}.
