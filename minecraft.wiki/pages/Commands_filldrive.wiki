Fills the player's drive with dummy files. Presumably to stress test the game from crashes due to a full disk.

==Syntax==
<code>filldrive clear</code>
* Deletes all dummy files generated by the game
<code>filldrive fill <bytesRemaining: int></code>
* Fills the player's drive with dummy files until it has the specified bytes remaining free.
** The files are placed under the [[com.mojang]] directory.
** These test files are named after <code>test_file_0.dat, test_file_1.dat</code>, etc. Each file can be as big as 26,214,400 bytes, filled with the character <code>*</code>.
** The game can freeze as it is filling up the drive due to massive disk I/O usage.
** If you ran out of storage, the game kicks you out of the world after a few seconds running this command. The game cannot start any world until some disk space is cleared.
** If this command is re-run, it first deletes all dummy files before filling up the drive again.

==Arguments==
<code><bytesRemaining></code>: [[Argument types#int|int]]

Specifies the number of bytes the game should leave in your drive.

{{Arg desc|be=int}} This means the maximum amount of space this command leaves is around 2.14 GB

Negative numbers are accepted. The command fills the drive entirely without any errors.
