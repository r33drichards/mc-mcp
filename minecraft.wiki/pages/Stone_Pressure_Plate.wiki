A '''stone pressure plate''' is a stone variant of the [[pressure plate]] that can detect only [[player]]s and [[mobs]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A stone pressure plate can be mined with anything, but [[pickaxe]]s are the fastest. A stone pressure plate also breaks and drops itself if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if the block under the pressure plate is moved or destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
One stone pressure plate is generated naturally in each [[desert pyramid]]. Stone pressure plates can also generate in [[ancient cities]].

=== Crafting ===

== Usage ==
{{see also|Pressure Plate#Usage}}
A stone pressure plate has equivalent functionality as a [[Polished Blackstone Pressure Plate|polished blackstone pressure plate]], except for the additional functionality as a crafting ingredient.

=== Placement ===
{{main|Pressure Plate#Placement}}
A stone pressure plate can only be placed on the top of other blocks with either a full solid block face, a solid center, or a solid rim.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}
A stone pressure plate can be used to detect entities on top of it (players, mobs, etc.).

==== Activation ====
{{main|Pressure Plate#Activation}}
A stone pressure plate is activated only by [[mob]]s, [[player]]s and [[armor stand]]s, unlike wooden pressure plates.

Once activated, a pressure plate checks if entities are still present at regular intervals. A stone pressure plate checks every second (20 ticks), starting 20 ticks after activation, so it deactivates up to 20 ticks after the last entity has activated it.

Stone pressure plates are activated by minecarts only if the minecart contains a mob or player.

=== Behavior ===
For stone pressure plates, the [[Redstone circuit#Power level|power level]] is always 15. 

=== Note blocks ===
Stone pressure plates can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
