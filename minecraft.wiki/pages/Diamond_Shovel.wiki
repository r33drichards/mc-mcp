A '''diamond shovel''' is a variant of [[shovel]] that is crafted from [[diamond]]s. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the second-highest [[tier]] of shovel, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack damage, and durability than an [[iron shovel]]. It can be upgraded into a [[netherite shovel]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

=== Digging ===
A diamond shovel can be used to break dirt and soil-type materials faster. When breaking a block, it uses 1 durability. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

A diamond shovel can be used to create a [[dirt path]] by {{control|using}} (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}

=== Campfire ===
A diamond shovel can be used to extinguish a [[campfire]].

=== Weapon ===
Diamond shovels use 2 durability when used as a weapon.

==== {{JE}} ====
Diamond shovels have an attack speed modifier of -3, meaning they take 1 second to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]]. Diamond shovels deal {{hp|5.5}} damage.

==== {{BE}} ====
Diamond shovels always attack instantly and do {{hp|5}} damage.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
{{Crafting

A diamond shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[diamond]]s, with diamond restoring 25% of the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two diamond shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A diamond shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a diamond shovel can be upgraded to a [[netherite shovel]], increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed and attack damage, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.
