[[File:Eerie Mojang Office Party Logo.png|thumb|Logo for the Eerie Mojang Office Party]]
The '''Eerie Mojang Office Party''' (also known as '''Mojang Studios Mystery Live Event''') was an [[event server]], set inside a fictional version of the [[Mojang Studios]] company headquarters. It was first announced during a ''[[Minecraft Monthly]]'' episode on December 4, 2024, as a way to celebrate [[The Garden Awakens]] drop. The event ran from December 9, 2024 to December 20, 2024.

The event consisted of 5 lobbies (the Main Lobby, the QA Department, the Mob Factory, the Biome Labs and the Idea Vault), 4 mini-games (Rocket Arena, Mob Smash, Biome Drop, Cloud Race), and 5 daily challenges to earn [[character creator]] items and the [[Mojang Office Cape]]. Players could earn coins by collecting them around the map or playing games which can then be spent in the shop.

== Lobbies ==
[[File:Teleport menu (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Teleport menu]]
The server initially opens with [[players]] spawning inside a [[pale garden]], stationed beside a projector crediting the developers, Blockworks. Progressing down a narrow path leads to the outside of [[Mojang Studios]], predominately made out of [[pale oak planks]], where players can find a receptionist named [[Nils]], claiming that [[Tiny Jens|Jens]] and [[Tiny Agnes|Agnes]]<!--They're referred to as "Grown" in the files, so yes they are intended to be the Tinies, don't replace with their real selves--> are looking for them. 

Upon speaking with them, the front gate to the studio will be opened by sentient statues of [[Steve]] and [[Alex]]. 

The player is then given two items upon entering, a Sticker Book to keep track of challenges, and a Teleport item that opens up an interface where you can click on which department you want to go, including the one you're currently on. Both these items are usable everywhere except the Roller Coaster, Bug Squash, and Assembly Attack games.

=== Lobby ===
[[File:Lobby (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The main lobby]]
Upon entering the Lobby for the first time, players can speak with Jens and Agnes, who explain the situation. Somehow, the release of [[the Garden Awakens]] has unleashed chaos across the studio, Jens tasking players with going to each of the four departments to solve their problems through minigames. Behind him and Agnes are a row of computers with stools and lamps themed after [[skull]]s and [[creeper head]]s, while in front of them to the side are large boards that can show the daily challenges and "office notes" when {{control|interacted}} with. Beside the signs, and across the left and right sides of the room, are several [[vindicator]] employees working various jobs. Closest to the office notes are cartographers with [[maps]], alchemists with [[brewing stand]]s, and documentarians rearranging a thin [[bookshelf]]. Closest to the daily challenges are armorers, with a [[chicken]] running back and forth with a [[gold helmet]], sewers sheering a [[Sheep|white sheep]] and juggling [[wool]], and a long table with three vindicators ringing a [[bell]]. Behind the bell vindicators is a large gaping hole, infested with [[pale moss]], several [[creaking]]s peering from the darkness.

In the center of the Lobby is the shop, where players can buy items from one of two vendors. Entering through the front of the Lobby, players can eye lab coats and office passes to the left and right, the first vendor on the right. The opposing vendor is on the left side, in front of dev hats, with a rack of boosts in boxes to their right, reminiscent of vinyl albums or comic books. In the center are mystery potions and eerie soup, with scattered boxes all throughout the shop. A massive cubic replica of the Earth hovers above the shop, with faces of Steve and Alex repeatedly appearing at certain locations.

[[File:Stuck Steve (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|Steve stuck inside a pipe]]
To the sides of the room are color coded transits to each department, and between the transits are massive pipes that transport various mobs up and down. Occasionally, a Steve appears clinging onto a pipe’s inner wall, trying to escape. They can be “saved” by clicking a button in front of the pipes, which releases massive amounts of water to flush them; soon after clicking the button, Steve can be seen crying. This action should unlock the “Flush” [[#Sticker|sticker]]; however, due to a bug, a player might already have the sticker unlocked, even if they have just joined the event for the first time.

Between the transits to the Mob Factory and QA Department are vindicator leatherworkers, weaponsmiths, and fletchers, working on [[leather]] pelts, a [[diamond sword]], and a [[target]] respectively. Between the transits to Biome Labs and the Idea Vault are masons, fishermen, and farmers, who are crafting [[stone bricks]], [[fishing]] [[cod]] in a small pond, and harvesting [[wheat]] respectively. On the north and south walls of the Lobby are [[stained glass]] windows, likened after [[creeper]]s, [[endermen]], [[allay]], and [[blaze]]s, with the text in Standard Galactic Alphabet reading: CREEPER.

Beside the transit to the QA Department is a queue of various mobs, as well as [[Sunny]] and [[Kai]], where several quick gags will play. An [[iron golem]] will knock a [[zombie]] in lime away, sending it to the back, where it will scare a [[villager]] to regain its place. This in turn causes the villager to cut in line, in front of Sunny, to their irritation. A creeper will explode, sending the villager back, before an enderman picks the villager up, scaring them enough to send them back to the end of the line, renewing the cycle. The line itself leads up to a Constructor [[NPC]], who when {{control|interacted}} with can initiate the rollercoaster minigame, which the player exits on the opposite side of the wall. 

Between the exit and entrance to the minigame is a second spawn point, where players will enter the server after all log-ins following the cold open. On the wall behind them is an array of giant [[clock]]s, showing various time zones, above a confetti cannon, several tables, many large cardboard boxes, and a cardboard cutout of Agnes and a creaking.
{{-}}

=== QA Department ===
[[File:QA Department (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|A view of the QA Department lobby.]]
The QA Department is dedicated to bug fixing. When joining this lobby, players fall from the yellow tube facing the exit, stationed above a flight of stairs. Periodically, a zombie will chase a villager around, having fallen out the tubes, before returning. Beside the exit area are two groups of vindicators. To the left is a small library, with vindicators reading books at small tables. To the right is what appears to be a break area, with a vindicator seemingly waiting with a cup of coffee, two playing tabletop tennis, two playing Foosball, and a fifth clapping in the direction of the ping pong game.

In front of those groups are several more. Closest to the player are computer desks, with vindicators sitting and typing in various methods. To the left of those are another recreation area, consisting of just tables and three vindicators having a conversation, while to the right are two empty tables. 

A separate desk with Agnes is located further in the middle; by talking to her, players can enter the [[#Bug Squash|Bug Squash]] minigame. Behind this desk are the daily challenge board and the leaderboard, and beyond that a ginormous recreation of a keyboard. The keyboard is modeled after a QWERTY keyboard specifically, but with keys written in the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]], and an Escape key replaced with creaking eyes. Jumping on this “Eerie” key unlocks the “Typist” [[#Stickers|sticker]]. Beyond the keyboard is a window into the minigame, with a wall panel of various glyphs to the right, above a pale garden leak with a coin.

On the lobby’s left are the Bug Files, an exhibit dedicated to the game’s bugs and curiosities. The first floor has three mobs displayed in glass cases, with Sunny and Kai present, marveling at the oddities. The exhibits include a [[squid]] which can fly ({{bug|MC-936}} and {{bug|MC-89883}}) and be [[milk]]ed (in [[Java Edition Beta 1.2]]), a "dancing" [[Ender dragon]], and a [[wither]] that causes fatal [[crash]]es. All three of those bugs are deemed as contained. Behind the displays are several nonfuctional drawers, and to the sides are [[Wooden Slab|stairs]], leading up to a second floor. Upon marching up, the player can find several paintings or tapestries of bugs; literal insects, colored red, yellow, green, or cyan. In the center of the area is a fourth display, the [[Jeb sheep]], however it has managed to escape, leaving a gaping hole in the glass.

[[File:QA Department parkour track (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The QA Department’s parkour track]]
The lobby’s right houses a large parkour track, themed around video game consoles. The track begins by platforming across several red platforms across from what appears to be a smartphone or tablet, before arriving at two sets of [[ladder]]s, leading to a laptop and confetti cannon. Inside the laptop are [[Stone Stairs|stone stair]] keys, as opposed to functional ones used elsewhere, with a track-pad made of [[polished andesite]]. The track continues into a PC resembling [[quartz bricks]], with several more red platforms before transitioning to platforming across internal components. If the player falls at any point, they can climb a ladder to return to the start of the area.

Once the player circles to the top of the machine, players jump onto the top of the laptop, and can find the Jeb sheep hiding in the darkness. {{Control|Interacting}} with it will unlock the Bug-Catcher sticker, with a coin even further down. The track continues across more platforms, up to a {{W|Nintendo Switch}}, with the player walking across [[cauldron]]s onto more platforms, another Jeb sheep hiding nearby. On the path upwards is an iron golem, protecting a secret office that requires the player to have the [[#Office Pass|Office Pass]] in order to enter. After climbing up another ladder and traveling a long path of platforms, the player will end up on the top, with the reward being several coins.
{{-}}

=== Mob Factory ===
[[File:Mob Factory (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|A view of the Mob Factory’s entrance area.]]
The Mob Factory is an industrial setting where the mobs are said to be made. Players entering the Mob Factory emerge from a giant cyan tube in the ceiling, facing the left of the area. To the left of the player is a selection of defective mobs held in reddish stasis chambers, and to the right the exit to the Lobby, along with more tubes, are a pair of sheetboards (daily challenges to the left and the leaderboard to the right), and stained glass windows of an iron golem.

Behind the spawn is a collection of cardboard boxes, with a confetti cannon at the top of the closest and a coin on the tallest. Beyond those are a series of conveyor belts, alternating between creepers, skeletons, TNT, and iron golems, in front of three more stasis chambers. Agnes stands in front of the area, marking the entrance to the [[#Assembly Attack|Assembly Attack]] section, with observatories into each area of the minigames nearby. Near one of the windows is a coin.

[[File:The Redstone Engine (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|A view of the Redstone Engine parkour from the outside.]]
Directly in front of the players visiting the Mob Factory is the Redstone Engine parkour course, which begins by leaping onto several floating red platforms, onto a conveyor belt delivering boxes. Jumping across several pipes leads to some more red platforms, before the player reaches a [[Copper Grate|catwalk]]. After going up a flight of [[Cut Copper Stairs|cut copper stairs]], the player reaches another conveyor belt, and must cross more red platforms, onto higher pipes.

After a steep leap onto a curving pipe, the player must take a risky jump over to a ladder, and continue running across pipes. A similar stunt occurs at the end of the pipe, with the player having to reach onto a ladder on the side of a platform, and then creep onto another platform. After more platforming, the player reaches a conveyor belt suspended over the catwalks, before climbing up platforms to another set of catwalks, with a coin nearby.

More platforms and pipe sequences occur, until the player must take another push towards a ladder. However, due to the presence of a pipe above, the way to reach it is instead to run off the edge and grip onto the platform below, up to another conveyor belt. From there a series of red platforms curve around to a final pipe, before reaching the top of the engine, which upon completion unlocks the “Engineer” [[#Stickers|sticker]]. Players can jump off the Redstone Engine’s top onto a large slime block platform.
{{-}}

=== Biome Labs ===
[[File:Biome Labs (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|A view of the Biome Labs.]]
Upon entering the Biome Labs, the player will appear fall to the center of the room from a large green tube, surrounded by small dioramas depicting various [[biome]]s. Immediately before the player are Jens, who explains the setting, and Agnes, who explains that the pale garden is invading the other biome. In order to solve this problem, she offers a tutorial to the Biome Drop minigame, which can be walked into on three nearby walkways corresponding to difficulty. Immediately behind the player are small reserves of water, between flower beds with built in confetti cannons.

Beside the easy version is an [[old growth pine taiga]], with several [[fox]]es sleeping, a fan block blowing [[leaves]] around, and a window into a [[lush cave]] infested with [[frog]]s. Across from there is an [[ice spikes]] biome, with a [[polar bear]] staring at a fan creating sparkle particles. Between easy and medium is a cherry grove, with inexplicable armadillos sleeping amongst a fan blowing [[cherry leaves]] and [[pink petals]]. On the opposite side of the path is a [[forest]], with [[bee]]s floating alongside [[beehive]]s, a [[bee nest]], and [[Honeycomb Block|honeycombs]]. Beside the hard option is a desert, with a [[camel]] resting beside heaters and a [[desert well]], across from a [[coral reef]] aquarium. Beside the desert and reef are a [[bamboo jungle]], with a [[panda]] eating [[bamboo]] amongst several sprinklers, and a window into a [[beach]] with a [[turtle]].

[[File:Biome Labs Diamond Biome Dome (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Diamond Biome Dome.]]
There are two Biome Domes players can visit containing fictional biomes, To the right, between the jungle and the desert, is a cyan biome where nearly everything is made out of [[diamond]]s. The [[tree]]s resemble [[oak]], [[pale oak]], and [[spruce]], but with [[dark oak log]]s and diamond cyan leaves. Closest to the entrance is one adorned with diamond [[Cave Vines (feature)|cave vines]] and diamond [[resin clump]]s, with diamond [[eyeblossom]]s and [[diamond ore]] scattered throughout. While exploring the dome, diamond [[Snowfall|snow]] will fall from the top of the dome. Traveling across a [[fallen tree]] bridge over a [[river]], players can find a small research station, with a scientist NPC standing on a [[dirt]] block amongst the cyan grass. Nearby is a small cave made of [[Coarse Dirt|coarse dirt]], with a coin inside. At the end of the lake is an ordinary spruce.

[[File:Biome Labs Goodlands Biome Dome (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Goodlands Biome Dome.]]
To the left is the "Goodlands" biome, a more cheerful version of the [[badlands]] with flowering [[cacti]], clovers, and flowers that generate bubbles. In the middle of the biome is an Engineer with a similar station to the Scientist, and beside them is a [[pond]] with a large assortment of flowers and a rainbow. Behind the Engineer is a [[mineshaft]], with glowing [[mushroom]]s inside and another coin. Once the player would like to leave the dome, they can return to a fan and be lifted up to the first level.

The black starry sky above the lobby features six bright “constellations” represnting a [[pickaxe]], a [[sword]], a diamond, a drawn [[bow]], a [[creeper]] face and one other object.
{{-}}

=== Idea Vault ===
[[File:Idea Vault (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Idea Vault’s starting platform]]
Upon entering the Idea Vault, the player will fall out of a giant purple tube, and see a build of a light bulb floating in mid-air. The lobby is by far the smallest of those featured in the server, consisting of a large [[planks|acacia]] platform on a [[cloud]]. To the left and right of the initial drop are the leaderboard and daily challenges, alongside common decorations such as balloons, boxes, and carpeting. A few blocks away from spawn is Jens, who explains the purpose of the vault.

Agnes can be found by dropping down through a ring of copper blocks, standing in a jumpsuit in front of a starting line. If spoken to, she will offer an explanation and tutorial for the Cloud Race minigame. Beside her lie several objects that are used throughout the race, allowing them to be safely tested and experimented with before beginning. Behind the drop zone is a fan, allowing players to return to Jens' area, returning through the initial tube. Behind the initial drop is a flight of stairs, leading up to oversized potted plants, several mob tunes, and a return tube to the Lobby.
{{-}}

== Games ==
=== Roller Coaster ===
[[File:Rollercoaster (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|A view of the rollercoaster.]]
The roller coaster mostly goes above the main lobby. Near the track are 12 target balloons. The player gets a full [[hotbar]] of [[snowball]]s (9 stacks of 16, for a total of 144 snowballs) to hit them. Each hit balloon gives 10 points. A balloon quickly respawns so it can be hit by other players on the rollercoaster. Hitting a balloon twice or more doesn’t count towards the player’s score, and sends a message in chat to tell the player they have already hit the balloon. Hitting all 12 balloons during one ride is meant to unlock the “Hotshot” [[#Stickers|sticker]]; however, due to a bug, players coming to Eerie Mojang Office Party for the first time may already have the sticker unlocked.

<!--5 targets: 1 star-->
<!--9 targets: 2 stars-->

=== Bug Squash ===
[[File:Bug Squash (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Bug Squash arena. Players spawn at the round black platform in the middle.]]
The player spawns on a black rounded platform and gets 60 seconds to get as many points as they can by using the Dev Hammer to squash bugs that spawn on 3×3 pillars of various heights. A pillar is colored red and black when a bug is present and is green and white otherwise, but the transition is not instanteous. Three kinds of bugs exist: a red one (the most common kind) yields 10 points, a yellow one yields 50 points, and a green one yields 10 points and adds 10 seconds to the timer. If not squashed in time after spawning, a bug burrows back into the pillar and despawns. If the player falls off a pillar, they lose five seconds and respawn at the black platform.

Game ends just the players squash all bugs with Dev Hammer.

=== Assembly Attack ===
[[File:Assembly Attack (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|Players fight a skeleton in fire in the Assembly Attack minigame.]]
Assembly Attack is a PVE game where players must kill defective mobs on a series of assembly lines, while ignoring the mobs that can appear in a normal ''Minecraft'' game. Mobs stay on the lines until provoked by hitting them; this applies both to defective and proper mobs, and a mob can also become aggressive to the players if it is hit by a different mob’s attack. Killing defective mobs grants a certain amount of points depending on what kind of mob they are, while killing proper mobs removes the same amount of points.

Players are in teams of up to 4 and are each given full [[diamond armor]], a [[diamond sword]] and a [[bow]] enchanted with [[Infinity]]. The arrows can pierce multiple mobs. Unlike the rest of the event, players can take damage and be killed by mobs or the environment, such as lava.

The game is split into 5 rooms: the Skeleton Armoury{{sic|British English}}, the TNT Factory, the Golem Manufacture, the Creeper Production, and the Distribution Center. The first four rooms have specific mob types: [[skeleton]]s, [[TNT]], [[Iron Golem|(iron) golems]] and [[creepers]] respectively. The Distribution Center has mobs of all four types. Players who have reached the Golem Manufacture unlock the “Operator” [[#Stickers|sticker]], while reaching the Distribution Center unlocks the “Technician” sticker.

The Skeleton Armoury room is active 40 seconds while the other rooms are active 50 seconds. Once a room is no longer active, the next one immediately becomes active and the player has 10 seconds to go there. If the player does not go the next room, they are teleported there.

=== Biome Drop ===
The Biome Drop is an implementation of the Dropper minigame, where the player needs to reach the bottom of a drop (more specifically, a water pond) as quickly as possible while evading obstacles during their fall. In this version, landing onto an obstacle does not kill the player by fall damage but can slow them down. Particularly noteworthy are [[slime block]]s, which can bounce the player upwards if they don’t [[sneak]].

There are three variants of the Biome Drop with different levels of difficulty, indicated by the amount of stars (from one to three). Each is themed around a specific selection of biomes and generated structures, though all have features of the [[pale garden]] at the very bottom.
# The easy dropper features surface biomes, namely a [[plains]] biome with a [[village]], a [[taiga]] with a structure similar to a [[pillager outpost]], a [[jungle]] with a [[Jungle Pyramid|pyramid]], a [[cherry grove]] and ends with a pale garden.
# The medium dropper has a [[mushroom field]], a [[desert]] with a [[Desert Pyramid|pyramid]], a [[lush cave]], a [[dripstone cave]] with a [[mineshaft]], a [[deepslate]] layer with a [[trial chamber]]-like structure, and finishes with the hybrid of a pale garden and the [[deep dark]] with the ruins resembling an [[ancient city]]. Completing the medium dropper in under 15 seconds unlocks the “Drip” [[#Stickers|sticker]].
# The hard dropper is themed around [[the Nether]] and [[the End]], beginning with the [[Nether wastes]] containing a [[Nether fortress|fortress]], continued by a [[basalt delta]] with a patch of [[soul soil]] (referencing a [[soul sand valley]]), a [[bastion remnant]], a [[stronghold]] with an oversized [[End portal]], an [[End city]], a few outer End islands, and the End’s mainland partially overtaken by the pale garden, with the target pond stylized as an [[exit portal]]. Completing the hard dropper in under 20 seconds unlocks the “Drop” [[#Sticker|sticker]].

=== Cloud  Race ===
[[File:Cloud Race start (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Cloud Race start. A [[penguin]] hologram can be seen.]]
These minigames look like the Elytra Ring Rush from [[15 Year Journey]]. The Cloud Race minigame features a single-lap race with obstacles, splits, boosters and two elytra gliding sections, similar to Ace Race from the [[MCC x Minecraft 15th Anniversary Party]] event. The goal is to complete the race as soon as possible.

There are a few kinds of boosters: the red arrow booster increases speed, while the cyan circle booster increases jump height. The green arrow booster allows players to do a second jump in mid-air, and is only found in front of the elytra gateways. There are also air-sucking mechanisms that can pull the player upwards. Each booster and mechanism can be tried out just before the track’s start. Using five speed boosters and jump pads in one race unlocks the “Speedy” and “Bouncy” [[#Stickers|stickers]] respectively.

[[File:Cloud Race finish (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|The Cloud Race finish]]
The race track is set in a variety of [[biome]]s and is decorated with holographic images of various [[Mob Vote]] mobs, both winning ones such as the [[armadillo]] and losing ones such as the [[iceologer]]. The finish has a group of [[villager]]s awaiting the players, as well as a pair of confetti cannons.

=== Office Pass ===
The Office Pass can be used on the QA Department Lobby to unlock a secret room found halfway up the parkour challenge. You need to have the card with you to enter. 

Inside the office, a pale garden has overgrown, with hanging moss seeping from the ceiling and pale moss floor. A balcony looking out over the keyboard window is nearby, as well as a computer which can be used to monitor several points in the area. At the end of the room there is a coin and an Item Stash that will give you many items found in the shop, including three mystery potions, three eerie soup, four speed boosts, and four jump boosts. Adding up the value of each item (2500 coins) and subtracting the cost of the card (1000 coins), the player can receive a value of 1500 coins.<gallery widths="200px" heights="180px" caption="Secret Office Access">

=== Stickers ===
[[File:All Pages of Completed Sticker Book (Eerie Mojang Office Party).png|thumb|360px|All pages of the Sticker Book after getting all the stickers.]]
Players can earn up to 17 stickers by completing challenges. These stickers appear in the player's sticker book. Note that due to a server bug, the first two stickers, "Hotshot" and "Flush", might already be unlocked for players who have joined the event for the first time. The "Apprentice", "Journeyman" and "Master!" stickers have additional descriptions when completed. However, due to another bug, the descriptions for the "Apprentice" and "Journey" stickers when completed are swapped.<ref>{{citation|url= https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/32554180214029-How-to-Join-the-Eerie-Mojang-Office-Party|title=How to Join the Eerie Mojang Office Party|website=help.minecraft.net|quote= The sticker book indicates that a Mojang Office shirt is awarded for becoming an Apprentice in the first daily challenge, but the reward is actually the Mojang Office cap that appears in your Dressing Room.}}</ref>

Although the Agnes NPC at the lobby states that there is a "special reward" for completing the entire sticker book, there has not been found to be one.

=== Daily Challenges ===
[[File:Eerie Mojang Office Party rewards.jpeg|thumb|Rewards for completing daily challenges.]]
[[File:Eerie Mojang confetti launcher.png|200px|thumb|A confetti cannon]]
During the first 5 days of the event, daily challenges appear on the whiteboards in lobbies at 18:00 UTC. Players can complete these challenges to earn exclusive [[character creator]] items. These challenges can be completed at any point during the event.

Due to a bug, the Mojang Office Cap became unobtainable, likely due to the fact that the Day 3 challenge for collecting 1000 coins is automatically marked as completed upon first entering the server, despite the player never accumulating any coins at all, causing the server to never register that the player completed one challenge.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-189094}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* Of the game's characters, only Steve, Alex, Sunny, and Kai make appearances.
* In a photo showing the rewards for the server, the mojang office cape is referred to as the "EyeBlossom" cape.
* The server resource pack is internally referred to as "McLive 2024 RP", with its description being "Minecraft Live 2024 Resource Pack".
* Instead of a [[Zombified Piglin|zombified piglin]], a [[zombie pigman]] appears in the tubes throughout the server. It's unclear if this was an oversight or an intentional visual gag.
* On the Enchanted Keyboard, the arrow keys all serve as one button, pressing down together.
* The Jeb_ sheep in the QA Department section of the map is referred to as a bug, though it is mentioned that [[Jens Bergensten]] is "suspected" of purposefully making it.
