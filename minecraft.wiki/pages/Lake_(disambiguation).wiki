'''Lakes''' are bodies of [[liquid]]s that are limited in size. In ''Minecraft'', lake-like formations can be generated by a variety of [[biome]]s, [[feature]]s and [[terrain features]], that are often mistakenly called "lakes", despite that there is no single cause for their generation.

The following biomes, features or terrain features are commonly referred to as "lakes":

== Biomes ==
* A small {{EnvLink|ocean}} biome surrounded by land on all sides.
* A wide section of a {{EnvLink|river}} biome.

* {{EnvLink|Delta|text=Deltas}}, one-block-deep sheets of constrained lava found in {{BiomeLink|basalt deltas}} biomes in the Nether.
* {{EnvLink|id=leaf-clay|Clay pools|link=none}}, shallow water pools surrounded by [[clay]] found in {{BiomeLink|lush caves}} biomes.

* An {{EnvLink|aquifer}}, which fills caves with water at different levels, creating underground lakes.
* A {{EnvLink|lava aquifer|link=none}}, which fills certain caves with lava below Y=0, creating underground lava lakes.
* {{EnvLink|Lava sea}}, which fills everywhere below Y=32 with lava in [[the Nether]].
