'''Minotaur''' is a half-human, half-bull creature that appears in the [[Minecraft Mini-Series]] and resides in the Maze of the Minotaur.

== Appearance ==
The Minotaur has a tall, muscular build. He has the head of a bull with large horns and a gold ring in his nose. He has brown hair all over his body and gold bracelets on his arms.

== Biography ==
In Episode 4 of Season 2, after [[Quinn]], [[River]], [[Durango]] and [[CommuniKate]] made it through the maze, they briefly encountered the Minotaur, as well as [[Cyclops]] and [[Cerberus]], but as they prepared to attack, [[Zed]] dug a large hole underneath them, causing the Minotaur and Cyclops to fall into it while Cerberus flew away.
The trio also appeared in Season 2, Episode 8, when [[CommuniKate]] tried to stop the Command Block Statue from self-destructing.

== Power and Abilities ==
The series does not show his abilities, but he presumably has great strength, durability, and speed.
