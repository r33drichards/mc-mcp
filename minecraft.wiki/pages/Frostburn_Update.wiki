The '''Frostburn Update''' is the name for [[Java Edition 1.10]], a major update released on June 8, 2016. It added some new features such as skeleton/zombie variants in snowy biomes and deserts respectively, polar bears, structure blocks for saving/loading structures in worlds, and an auto-jump feature. The official name for the update, the ''Frostburn Update'', was revealed on June 8, 2016, in a blog post on the Mojang website, the same day the update was released.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160608153158/http://www.mojang.com/2016/06/minecraft-110-an-update-of-fire-and-ice/</ref>

Being the smallest major update, development began shortly after [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]], the [[Combat Update]], was released, and snapshots began the week after [[Java Edition 1.9.3|1.9.3]] and [[Java Edition 1.9.4|1.9.4]] were released, in mid-May. Only 3 snapshots and 2 pre-releases were released for 1.10, between May 18, 2016, and June 8, 2016. Mojang released the [[Java Edition 1.10-pre1|first pre-release]] on June 2, 2016, and [[Java Edition 1.10-pre2|the second]] on June 7, one day before the update was released.

== Trivia ==
*The time span between the releases of [[16w20a]] and [[Java Edition 1.10-pre1|1.10-pre1]] was only 2 weeks, the smallest time between, unusual based on [[Mojang]]'s history, as 1.8 and 1.9 both took around a year or so to develop.

== Further revisions ==
*[[Java Edition 1.10.1|1.10.1]] fixed "some of the most annoying reported bugs."
*[[Java Edition 1.10.2|1.10.2]] was released soon thereafter to fix a crash from 1.10.1.
