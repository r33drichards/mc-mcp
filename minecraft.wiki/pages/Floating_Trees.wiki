{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Floating trees.ogg]]

"Floating Trees" is a warm, ethereal, and calming ambient track mostly played on an organ, accompanied by bright synths and backed by low strings, all playing on the same key as "[[Minecraft (song)|Minecraft]]".

There are some very quiet chiming sounds in the background near the end. The ending, which is softly played on a distant, echoing piano, is a callback to the ending melody of "[[Subwoofer Lullaby]]".
