A '''fishing rod''' is a [[tool]] that casts a bobber used to [[Fishing|fish]] in [[water]] or to hook and pull [[mob]]s, [[Item (entity)|items]]{{only|java|short=1}}, and some other [[entities]] toward the user.

{{Main|Fishing}}
Enchanted fishing rods are obtainable through fishing, with a 0.8% chance per attempt, while unenchanted ones are obtainable with a 0.2% chance per attempt. See [[fishing]] for more details.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|java}}, [[drowned]] have a 3.75% chance of spawning with a fishing rod equipped.
{{IN|bedrock}}, a naturally spawned drowned has a 0.85% chance to spawn with a fishing rod, while a converted drowned has a 1% chance to spawn with it.
If killed, they have an 8.5% chance of dropping this fishing rod. That chance increases by 1% for each level of Looting applied to a weapon (up to 11.5% chance). The dropped item is damaged and never enchanted.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources|Enchanted Fishing Rod}}

=== Carrot/warped fungus on a stick ===
If a [[carrot on a stick]] or a [[warped fungus on a stick]] is used to the point of zero durability, it becomes a fishing rod again.

== Usage ==
=== Fishing ===
{{main|Fishing}}

Fishing rods can be cast into water. After a short period of time, a stream of bubble particles approaches the fishing rod. If the rod is reeled in once the particles "bite" the bobber, the player obtains a fish, junk, or possibly a treasure item. If the fishing rod was in the player's hand and is no longer, the fishing bobber [[entity]] despawns, unless the fishing rod is moved to the off-hand or it has been swapped with another fishing rod.{{Cn|Cn=Research on the way fishing rods behave when you swap rod or have two equipped (one in the main and one in the off hand) needs to be done}}

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Fishing Rod, Damaged Fishing Rod}}

=== Hooking mobs and other entities ===
{{see also|Fishing#Fishing rod durability}}

The fishing rod can be used to hook [[mob]]s and some other [[entities]], including [[item (entity)|items]]{{only|java}} and [[player]]s. The fishing rod can then be reeled in, dragging the hooked object toward the player without dealing damage. Reeling in a [[mob]] or entity costs 5 points of durability, and reeling in an item costs 3 points. Reeling a mob pulls it toward the player with a speed of {{frac|1|10}} the distance between the mob and the player. Hooking entities {{in|BE}} with a flaming bobber cast through fire or lava can ignite the entity.

The maximum distance the [[player]] can get between the bobber and themselves is 33 blocks. A hooked entity that exceeds this distance detaches from the bobber.

{{:Calculators/Projectile motion|name=Bobber|type=3|gravity=-0.03|dragx=0.92|dragy=0.92|hideproperties=1|hidedynamics=1}}

Multiple players can hook the same entity, and when multiple players reel in the entity at the same time, it flies a larger distance than normal.

Besides mobs and items, entities that can be reeled in include:
* {{ItemLink|id=oak boat|Boats}}
* {{ItemLink|id=oak boat with chest|Boat with Chest|Boat with Chests}}
* {{ItemLink|Minecart|Minecarts}} of any type
* {{ItemLink|Armor Stand|Armor Stands}}
* {{EntityLink|Shulker Bullet|Shulker Bullets}}
* {{EntityLink|Fireball|Fireballs}}
* {{BlockSprite|TNT}} Primed [[TNT]]
* Any [[falling block]] such as:
** {{BlockLink|Sand}}
** {{BlockLink|Gravel}}
** {{BlockLink|Dragon Egg|Dragon Eggs}}
** {{BlockLink|Concrete Powder}}
** {{BlockLink|Scaffolding}}
** {{BlockLink|Snow}} {{only|BE}}
** {{BlockLink|Anvil|Anvils}}

Some entities can be hooked, but cannot be reeled in: 
* {{EntitySprite|Horse}} Players or mobs riding vehicles or other mobs {{only|java}}
* {{EntityLink|Painting|Paintings}}
* {{EntityLink|Item Frame|Item Frames}} {{only|JE}}
* {{EntityLink|id=leash-knot|Lead#Leash Knot|Lead knots}}
* {{EntityLink|End Crystal|End Crystals}}
* {{EntityLink|Shulker|Shulkers}}

Attempting to reel in said entities still costs durability to the rod.

Any other entities cannot be hooked at all.

==== Dismounting entities ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|be}}, a mob or a player riding a [[minecart]], a [[boat]], or a mob can be dismounted by reeling it in.

=== Fuel ===
A fishing rod can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per fishing rod, regardless of its durability.

=== Redstone ===
The hook can also be used to activate [[wooden pressure plate]]s or [[weighted pressure plate]]s.

'''Fishing bobbers''' have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity. {{IN|je}}, they despawn after being on ground for more than 1200 ticks. When fishing bobber enters water ({{nbt|bool|OnGround}} becomes {{cd|false}}), despawn timer resets. {{info needed|How long it takes to despawn on BE?}}

*[[Skeleton]]s can be pulled into their own [[arrow]]s.
*When casting the rod into a [[Nether Portal (block)|Nether portal]], the bobber may stick to it like a normal [[block]], go through and travel in [[the Nether]], or stop on the next block behind the portal.
*If the player stands directly in front of a [[bubble column]] and casts the line onto a block above the player, the line falls downward, if it is a downwards one.
