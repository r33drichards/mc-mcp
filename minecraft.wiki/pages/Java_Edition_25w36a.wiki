'''25w36a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.9]], released on September 2, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w36a|id=a|September 2, 2025}}</ref> It improves several textures and visual features, adds the ability to set different [[world border]]s in different dimensions, and adds a new technical mob.

== Additions ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[File:Steve (slim) JE2.png|50px]] [[Mannequin]]'''
* Added a new type of technical entity called <code>minecraft:mannequin</code> which can only be spawned with summon commands.
** A mannequin is a player avatar without a connected player.
** Mannequins always show an "NPC" text where a Player's <code>below_score</code> score would show.
** Mannequins function as living entities, like [[armor stand]]s.
*** They can hold and wear equipment, have attributes & effects, take damage, etc.
** Data Fields:
*** <code>profile</code> - Which profile to show on the entity. This is either a Player profile (same format as a <code>minecraft:profile</code> component) or a Mannequin profile with the following fields:
**** <code>texture</code> - Namespaced ID of the skin texture to use.
***** The skin is specified relative to the <code>textures</code> folder and with a <code>.png</code> suffix.
***** e.g. <code>entity/player/wide/steve</code> will use the default wide Steve skin.
**** <code>cape</code> - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use.
***** When specified, uses the same format as the <code>texture</code> field.
***** Omitting this field means the mannequin has no cape.
**** <code>elytra</code> - Optional namespaced ID of the elytra texture to use.
***** When specified, uses the same format as the <code>texture</code> field.
***** Omitting this field means the mannequin uses the cape texture, or if that is also omitted, the default elytra texture when wearing elytra.
**** <code>model</code> - Optional model type, one of <code>wide</code> and <code>slim</code>.
***** If omitted, <code>wide</code> is used.
*** <code>hidden_layers</code> - List of outer skin layers to hide.
**** Valid entries: <code>cape</code>, <code>jacket</code>, <code>left_sleeve</code>, <code>right_sleeve</code>, <code>left_pants_leg</code>, <code>right_pants_leg</code>, <code>hat</code>.
*** <code>main_hand</code> - Which hand is the main hand of the mannequin.
**** One of <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>.
** This entity highly resembles the [[Mob (entity)|Mob]] entity removed long ago in [[Java Edition Beta 1.2|Beta 1.2]], as it is has a player skin and has no movement AI.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks === 
'''[[Copper lantern]]''' and '''[[copper torch]]'''
* Adjusted the colors to make them more discernible to color blind players.

'''[[Shelf]]'''
* Powered shelves can now only connect to other powered shelves facing the exact same direction.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|86.0}}.

'''[[End flash]]'''
* While the ender dragon fog effect is active, the flash source in the sky is not visible and the brightness of the light affecting the world is reduced.

'''[[Key binds]]'''
* Multiple key binds that have the same key assigned to them can now work together, while before only one would work.
** For example, it's now possible to bind the {{key|d}} key to Jump and Strafe Left, to jump and strafe left at the same time.
** The red warning for assigning the same key to multiple key binds is changed to yellow.
* Added a Spectator category in the key binds screen, alongside the pre-existing Highlight Players key bind.
* The spectator hotbar menu key can now be rebound.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* {{cd|dragon_breath}} now optionally takes a {{cd|power}} parameter (float, default {{cd|1.0}}), which is multiplied onto its initial velocity, after all randomness.
* {{cd|instant_effect}} and {{cd|effect}} now optionally take {{cd|power}} (float, default {{cd|1.0}}) and {{cd|color}} (rgb, default {{cd|0xFFFFFF}}) parameters.
* {{cd|flash}} now requires a {{cd|color}} parameter (argb).

'''[[Rendering]]'''
* Particles outside of players view are not rendered anymore, which provides a performance improvement in some cases.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|68.0}}.

'''Server Code of Conduct'''
* Formatting codes are now stripped from code of conduct files.

'''[[Shader]]s'''
* The following unused shaders have been removed:
** {{samp|core/position_color_lightmap.vsh}}
** {{samp|core/position_color_lightmap.fsh}}
** {{samp|core/position_color_tex_lightmap.vsh}}
** {{samp|core/position_color_tex_lightmap.fsh}}
* Minor change to uv calculations in the <code>minecraft_sample_lightmap</code> function in the <code>core/terrain.vsh</code> program.

'''[[UI]]'''
* Double-clicking a word in edit box now selects it.

'''[[World border]]'''
* The world border is now dimension-specific.
** This means that each dimension can have its own world border size, position, etc.
