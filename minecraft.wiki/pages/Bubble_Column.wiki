A '''bubble column''' is an [[Drowning|air]]-providing vertical [[water]] current. It is created by [[magma block]]s and [[soul sand]] and, depending on the [[block]] used, will either pull [[entities]] downward or push them upward, respectively.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|java}}, bubble columns cannot be obtained as an [[item]], and can only be placed by a [[block]]-placement [[command]] such as {{cmd|setblock}}.

{{IN|bedrock}}, it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing, add-ons, or bugs.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Bubble_columns.gif|thumb|245px|''Java Edition'' bubble column. (Click to see the animation)]]
Whirlpool bubble columns may appear naturally when [[magma block]]s generate underwater, in [[Underwater magma|clusters]] on the floor of [[aquifer]]s, or as part of [[ocean ruins]] and [[ruined portal]]s generated below the [[water]] surface.

=== Post-generation ===
When a [[magma block]] is placed underwater, a whirlpool bubble column is generated. 

When [[soul sand]] is placed under source water blocks, an upward bubble column is generated.

A bubble column is created 20 game ticks after placing a magma block or soul sand, and is destroyed 5 game ticks after destroying the magma block or soul sand. A bubble column is created or destroyed in all water source blocks of the bubble column simultaneously.

== Usage ==
[[Player]]s and air-breathing [[mob]]s can enter a bubble column to replenish their [[Drowning|air supply]] at the same speed that they would when they leave the water entirely. However, the [[Water#Slower mining speed|slower mining speed]] when underwater still applies to players inside bubble columns. Water-breathing mobs avoid bubble columns because they suffocate if trapped in one. A bubble column is destroyed when moved by a [[piston]]. Bubble columns propagate only through water source blocks, stopping at any flowing water or [[waterlogged]] block. The height of a bubble column is limited only by the water's surface or by any obstructing blocks underwater. {{IN|Bedrock}}, using [[powder snow]] to remove water sources from a bubble column and destroying the powder snow with flowing water creates a bubble column without water.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-128305}}</ref>

Bubble columns cannot be created in downward flowing water.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-85448|||WAI}}</ref> This can be circumvented by placing [[kelp]] in downward-flowing water, which converts it into a source block.

=== Whirlpool ===
A whirlpool, or downward bubble column, is the only type that naturally generates in the Overworld, often originating from [[magma]] at the bottom of underwater [[canyon]]s. A whirlpool can be identified by the presence of air bubbles wandering downward. They drag [[entities]] downward. A [[boat]] ridden over a whirlpool shakes and eventually sinks if kept above the whirlpool for too long.

=== Upward ===
Upward bubble columns can be identified by the presence of vertically rising air bubbles. An upward bubble column accelerates entities upward. The longer an object rises through the bubble column, the faster it travels. At high enough speeds, players and entities can be launched out of water by several blocks. Sitting on the surface above a rising bubble column causes entities to bounce upward repeatedly by about 1 block.

=== Transport ===
In {{edition|java}}, entities move at a speed of approximately 11 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 4.9 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.

In {{edition|bedrock}}, entities move at a speed of approximately 8 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 6 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.

=== Redstone component ===
An [[observer]] can detect when a bubble column is created or destroyed in a water source block.

=== Ender pearl stasis chamber ===
Projectiles such as [[ender pearl]]s are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a [[trapdoor]]), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.
