'''''Minecraft Legends''''' is an action strategy video game released on April 18, 2023, developed by [[Mojang Studios]] and [[Blackbird Interactive]], and published by {{w|Xbox Game Studios}} on Windows and Xbox, and Mojang Studios on other platforms. It features music by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1308709/ Crispin Hands].

On January 10, 2024, it was announced that [[MCL:1.18.19068|1.18.19068]] was ''Minecraft Legends''<nowiki/>'s last update, but it is still available to be purchased, downloaded, and played.<ref>{{mcnet|lost-legends-snow-vs-snouts|Lost Legends: Snow vs Snouts|January 10, 2024|Cristina Anderca}}</ref>

== Plot ==
''Minecraft Legends'' is set in the same universe as {{MC}} as a forgotten tale lost in time and only remembered by the {{MCL|villager}}s in the form of legends passed down throughout the generations.<ref name="mcl"/> It is unknown whether the events of those legends were fact or fiction, but they are the main setting of the game.

The tale takes place in an {{MCL|Overworld}}, which the forces of the {{MCL|Nether}} known as the {{MCL|piglin}}s attempt to invade. Sensing the invasion, a trio of celestial creatures collectively known as the {{MCL|Host}}s summon a miner from their home Overworld and into the Hosts' home, the {{MCL|Well of Fate}}. They subsequently entice the miner to help stop the piglin invasion threatening {{MCL|village}}s, and the newly named {{MCL|hero}} does so by destroying three {{MCL|piglin outpost}}s, then a {{MCL|piglin base}} named the {{MCL|Night Beacon}}. Soon after, they destroy three piglin bases from each area of the Overworld taken over by a {{MCL|piglin horde}} before facing the hordes' respective bosses: {{MCL|the Beast}}, {{MCL|the Devourer}}, and {{MCL|the Unbreakable}}.

Because of these bosses' death, the piglins' overlord, {{MCL|the Great Hog}}, arrives in the Overworld and tries to destroy the Well of Fate until they get defeated by the hero, ending the invasion. This causes a large celebration before the Hosts leave the Well of Fate.

 
{{Q|'''MINECRAFT LEGENDS''' – Stories are powerful. Legends teach us about what has passed and what might have been. They create a bridge between us and generations long past as well as the ones to come. Starting today, we want to tell you another story – about peaceful coexistence, where adventurers did not get chills when hearing hissing, groans, or the clatter of bones. And the moment when a terrifying force threatened to corrupt this idyllic world forever. This is a story about the Overworld of Minecraft Legends. |Cristina Anderca<ref name="mcl">{{Mcnet|minecraft-legends|Minecraft Legends Announcement Article|June 12, 2022|Cristina Anderca}}</ref>}}

== Gameplay ==
''Minecraft Legends'' is a strategy game with some action elements. In the game, the player takes on the third person perspective of a great hero who must defend [[Legends:Structure#Ally settlements|settlements]] & [[Legends:Village|villages]], create outposts, make allies with mobs, and fight hordes of [[MCL:Piglin|piglins]] to stop the spread of their Nether corruption within a procedurally generated world. The game allows the player character to direct and give directions to allies, as well as to gather [[MCL:Resource|resources]] to build [[MCL:Structure|structures]]. <ref name="mcl" /> The game includes random world generation that is different from ''Minecraft'' with mobs and biomes. The player character’s primary objective is to gather resources in the world to build defenses against the piglins. The game supports multiplayer gameplay with up to 8 players, 4 on each team, where they can either challenge other player characters for a battle or team up to defeat opponents.<ref name="mcl-steam">[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928870 Minecraft Legends on Steam]</ref><ref name="mcl-eshop">[https://nintendo.com/us/store/products/minecraft-legends-switch Minecraft Legends for Nintendo Switch - Nintendo Official Site]</ref>

''Minecraft Legends'' began first as an idea before Mojang Studios decided to collaborate with a Vancouver-based studio called [[Blackbird Interactive]] (who also developed ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'') to develop the game as a ''Minecraft'' strategy game.<ref name="mcl" />

=== Bosses ===
''Minecraft Legends'' has a total of 4 bosses. 3 of them appear after the player clears all of the bases of a horde, and one appears after the player defeats all three. They are:

'''The Beast'''
[[Minecraft Legends:The Beast|The Beast]] is a boss enemy and the leader of [[Minecraft Legends:Horde of the Hunt|the Horde of the Hunt]]. It can be fought after all of the Horde of the Hunt bases are destroyed. It is fast and highly destructive it tearing through structures. Sometimes at night, it launches an attack on a random village.

'''The Devourer'''
[[Minecraft Legends:The Devourer|The Devourer]] is a boss enemy and the leader of the [[Minecraft Legends:Horde of the Spore|Horde of the Spore]]. It has lots of overgrowth and fungi growths coming off its body and resemble that of a zombie-like life form. It can be fought after all of the Horde of the Spore bases are destroyed.

'''The Unbreakable'''
[[Minecraft Legends:The Unbreakable|The Unbreakable]] is a boss enemy and the leader of the [[Minecraft Legends:Horde of the Bastion|Horde of the Bastion]]. It can be fought after all of the Horde of the Bastion bases are destroyed. The Unbreakable is a large Piglin with lots of gold trimming, including a golden Mohawk, shoulder guard, and gauntlet. It also carries a large pack on its back which acts as a flamethrower. It also has an iron jaw. 

'''The Great Hog'''
[[Minecraft Legends:The Great Hog|The Great Hog]] is the final boss enemy of Minecraft Legends and the leader of all three Piglin hordes. It can be fought after all of the hordes are defeated.

Defeating it completes the game and results in all remaining piglins and their structures disappearing.
