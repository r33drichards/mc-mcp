A '''stone hoe''' is a variant of [[hoe]] that is crafted from [[cobblestone]]. It is used to [[till]] [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks into [[farmland]], and to break [[leaves]], [[haybale]]s, and [[Sculk family|sculk-related]] blocks faster. It is the fifth-highest [[tier]] of hoe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack speed, and durability than a [[wooden hoe]].

A stone hoe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[cobblestone]], [[cobbled deepslate]] or [[blackstone]], with each block restoring 32{{only|JE|short=1}} or 33{{only|BE|short=1}} durability (25% of its maximum durability, rounded down). Two stone hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Villager gifts ===
Toolsmith [[villager]]s occasionally throw stone hoes at players with the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect.{{Only|java}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Hoe#Usage}}

=== Harvesting ===
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 [[durability]].

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.

=== Tilling ===
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into [[farmland]]. To till, press {{control|use}} on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]],<ref>{{bug|MC-8231||Mycelium and podzol cannot be tilled with hoes}}</ref> nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including snow layers or torches. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.

Hoes can be used to convert [[coarse dirt]] into regular dirt by pressing {{control|use}} on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.

Hoes can also be used on [[rooted dirt]], which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a [[hanging roots]] item.

Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.

Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.<ref>{{bug|MC-167846||Hoe cannot be used on blocks with certain blocks on top even if said blocks can normally exist on farmland|WAI}}</ref>

=== Weapon ===
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only {{hp|1}} damage {{in|java}}. {{IN|bedrock}}, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.

{{IN|java}}, hoes have an attack speed modifier -2 (refill in 0.5s).

Hoes always attack instantly {{in|bedrock}}.

=== Enchantments ===
A hoe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*Tilling a [[dirt]] block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to [[farmland]] even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a [[block]] horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
*When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.
