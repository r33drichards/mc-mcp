An '''iron pickaxe''' is a variant of [[pickaxe]] that is crafted from [[iron ingot]]s. It is the third-highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, attack damage, and [[enchantability]] than a [[copper pickaxe]]. It has a [[mining level]] of 2, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[gold ore]], [[redstone ore]], [[emerald ore]], and [[diamond ore]].

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
An iron pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with an iron pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s.

==== Mining level ====
Iron pickaxes have a mining level of 2. An iron pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:
* {{BlockLink|Block of Diamond}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Emerald}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Gold}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Raw Gold}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Diamond Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Emerald Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Gold Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Redstone Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Diamond Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Emerald Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Gold Ore}}
* {{BlockLink|Redstone Ore}}

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to [[recover]]. Iron pickaxes do {{hp|4}} damage per attack, or 4.8 damage per second.

==== {{BE}} ====
All pickaxes attack instantly, with iron pickaxes doing {{hp|5}} damage per attack.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====
{{Crafting

|ignoreusage = 1
|ingredients = Damaged Iron Pickaxe|Damaged Iron Pickaxe|Damaged Iron Pickaxe
|Output = Iron Pickaxe
|description = The durability of the two pickaxes is added together, plus an extra 5% of durability.

|showdescription=1
|ingredients=Damaged Iron Pickaxe
|Damaged Iron Pickaxe

}}

==== Anvil repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
| head=1
| Damaged Iron Pickaxe
| Damaged Iron Pickaxe; Iron Ingot
| Iron Pickaxe
| tail=1
}}

An iron pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[iron ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two iron pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
An iron pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
