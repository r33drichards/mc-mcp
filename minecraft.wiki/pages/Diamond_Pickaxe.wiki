A '''diamond pickaxe''' is a variant of [[pickaxe]] that is crafted from [[diamond]]s. It is the second-highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, and attack damage than an [[iron pickaxe]]. It has a [[mining level]] of 3, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[obsidian]] and [[ancient debris]]. It can be upgraded into a [[netherite pickaxe]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]].

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
A diamond pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a diamond pickaxe consumes one durability point. No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s.

==== Mining level ====
Diamond pickaxes have a [[mining level]] of 3. A diamond pickaxe or better is required to mine the following blocks:
* {{BlockLink|Obsidian}}
* {{BlockLink|Crying Obsidian}} 
* {{BlockLink|Respawn Anchor}}
* {{BlockLink|Ancient Debris}}
* {{BlockLink|Block of Netherite}}
* {{BlockLink|Glowing Obsidian}}{{only|bedrock}}

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to [[recover]]. Diamond pickaxes do {{hp|5}} damage per attack, or 6 damage per second.

==== {{BE}} ====
All pickaxes attack instantly, with diamond pickaxes doing {{hp|6}} damage per attack.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

==== Anvil repair ====

{{Repairing

}}
A diamond pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[diamond]]s, with each diamond restoring 390 durability. Two diamond pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A diamond pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:

=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a diamond pickaxe can be upgraded to a [[netherite pickaxe]], increasing its durability and slightly increasing its mining speed, as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. The upgraded pickaxe will keep its enchantments, name and other item data.
