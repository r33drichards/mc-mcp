'''1.19 Pre-release 2''' (known as '''1.19-pre2''' in the launcher) is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on May 23, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-19-pre-release-2|Minecraft 1.19 Pre-Release 2|May 23, 2022}}</ref> which makes some tweaks, and fixes bugs, many of which are relating to [[sculk sensor]]s' vibration detection.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added following biome tag:
** {{cd|#mineshaft_blocking}}: contains {{cd|deep_dark}}.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Sculk sensor]]'''
* Added the {{cd|teleport}} game event that the sculk sensor reacts to, with frequency value 5.

=== Items ===
'''[[Goat horn]]'''
* Now dropped when a [[goat]] rams [[copper ore]] as well.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Warden]]'''
* Now despawn when stuck in a liquid instead of staying for a long time.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* "It Spreads" is no longer granted when a {{tooltip|mob that drops no experience|All baby animals, allays, bats, iron golems, snow golems, villagers, and wandering traders}} is killed near a [[sculk catalyst]].

=== General ===
'''Sound'''
* Reverted using generic equip sound when equipping non-armor items in the head slot in the last version: they no longer emit a sound.
** However, they are still able to activate sculk sensors.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added {{cd|copper_ore}} to the {{cd|#snaps_goat_horn}} block tag.
* Added {{cd|teleport}} game event to the {{cd|d=and|#vibrations|#warden_can_listen}} game event tags.
