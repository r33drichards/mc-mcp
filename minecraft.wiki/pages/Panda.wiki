A '''panda''' is a rare [[neutral mob]] that resides in [[jungle]]s. Certain aspects of a panda's behavior and appearance vary depending on its [[Panda#Personalities|personality]].

== Spawning ==
Pandas spawn rarely in groups of 1–2 in [[jungle]] biomes on [[grass block]]s with at least a two-block space above them. They are slightly {{Only|Bedrock}} or way {{Only|Java}} more common in [[bamboo jungle]]s and have a 5% chance to spawn as a baby. They do not spawn on [[podzol]].<ref>{{bug|MC-155811|||WAI}}</ref>

Pandas spawn with a randomized personality, with the normal personality being the most common and the brown variant being the rarest.

{{Mob spawn table|Panda}}

== Drops ==
=== Breeding ===
Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} experience orbs are dropped.
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Bamboo|notes=MC-160006|edition=java|quantity=1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Bamboo|edition=bedrock|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|notes=
MC-160006 = {{bug|MC-160006}}
}}
* {{xp|1|3}} experience orbs are dropped if killed by a tamed [[wolf]] or the [[player]].
Like other baby [[animal]]s, killing a baby panda yields no [[item]]s or [[experience]].

=== Sneezing ===
Baby pandas have {{frac|1|700}} chance to drop 1 {{ItemLink|slimeball}} after they sneeze. This means that, on average, a weak baby panda produces a slimeball every 4 hours, 51 minutes and 40 seconds, and any other baby panda produces 1 every 58 hours and 20 minutes.

== Behavior ==
A panda tends to roll off cliffs while playing around. Pandas act similarly to other neutral mobs and attack when hurt but only once, similar to [[llama]]s and [[bee]]s, except on [[Peaceful]] [[difficulty]], in which pandas are passive. Attacking pandas are far more vicious {{in|java}}. 

Pandas follow any player that is carrying [[bamboo]] and stop following if the player moves beyond approximately 16 blocks away. Pandas produce a whimper sound effect if a thunderstorm is happening in the area.

Adult pandas seek out bamboo and [[cake]] to eat.

Baby pandas have a {{frac|1|6000}} chance (0.01<span style="text-decoration:overline">6</span>%) of sneezing every [[game tick]]. Weak baby pandas are more likely to sneeze with a {{frac|1|500}} (0.2%) chance every tick. Sneezing makes all adult pandas within 10 blocks jump and rarely drops a [[slimeball]]. Baby pandas also occasionally roll over and jump around.

Pandas have one private inventory.

A [[lead]] cannot be used on a panda by normal means.<ref>{{bug|MC-137818|||WAI}}</ref> However, a panda can be leashed using a map editor or [[NBT]] editor.

Pandas can be ridden by baby [[zombie]] variants.{{only|bedrock}}

Unlike other neutral mobs, pandas don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

=== Personalities ===
[[File:PandaVariants.png|thumb|The different variations of pandas – from left to right: brown, lazy, worried, playful, weak, aggressive and normal.]]
Pandas have different personalities: normal, lazy, worried, playful, aggressive, weak, or brown.

* {{EntitySprite|Panda}} '''Normal pandas:'''
** Identifiable by their frown.
** Do not have unique personality actions. 

* {{EntitySprite|Lazy Panda}} '''Lazy pandas:''' 
** Identifiable by their smile.
** Lie on their backs.
** Are slower than normal pandas, making them the slowest land mob in the game.
** Do not follow a player who is holding [[bamboo]] while they're lying on their back.{{only|java|short=1}} {{IN|bedrock}}, if a [[player]] is holding bamboo, a lazy panda stops lying on its back and starts following that player.

* {{EntitySprite|Worried Panda}} '''Worried pandas:''' [[File:WorriedPandaOnRainScreen.jpg|thumb|A worried panda shaking and hiding its face during a thunderstorm.]]
** Identifiable by their worried expression.
** {{IN|java}}, they avoid the player and most [[monster]]s except [[ghast]]s, [[hoglin]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[phantom]]s, [[shulker]]s, [[slime]]s, [[skeleton horse]]s, [[zombie horse]]s, [[zombie nautilus]]es, [[camel husk]]s and the [[ender dragon]].<ref>{{bug|MC-304377||Worried Pandas are not scared of certain monsters}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, they avoid all non-panda mobs, including passive mobs.<!-- still move toward mobs attacking it after panic-->
** Shake and hide their faces during [[thunderstorm]]s.
** Do not eat bamboo or [[cake]] items on their own.{{only|java|short=1}}

* {{EntitySprite|Playful Panda}} '''Playful pandas:''' [[File:Panda Rolling.gif|thumb|x200px|A Playful panda rolling.]]
** Identifiable by their tongues that stick out.
** Roll over and jump around even as adults. The ability to roll may sometimes cause harm or kill the panda as it can accidentally roll off a cliff or into other environmental hazards.<ref>{{bug|MC-137859||Panda tries to roll over and jump into some dangerous places|WAI}}</ref>

* {{EntitySprite|Angry Panda}} '''Aggressive pandas:'''
** Identifiable by their thick eyebrows and tight frown.
** When hit, an aggressive panda attacks the [[player]] and other mobs continuously until the target dies or goes beyond detection range, instead of only once. It also doesn't panic when harmed.
** When nearby pandas are attacked, unless killed in one hit,{{Only|java|short=1}} aggressive pandas become hostile toward the attacker.
** Are slow, but have [[reach]] rivaling that of the player.

* {{EntitySprite|Weak Panda}} '''Weak pandas:'''
** Identifiable by their teary eyes and snotty noses.
** Tend to sneeze more often as babies than regular baby pandas, and have half the health of other pandas.

{{Anchor|Brown Panda}}{{Anchor|Brown panda}}
* {{EntitySprite|Brown Panda}} '''Brown pandas:'''
** Identifiable by their brown color and frown.
** Do not have unique personality actions, but are brown and white instead of the usual black and white.

=== Breeding ===
The panda is the only animal to have extra [[breeding]] conditions. {{IN|java}}, pandas enter love mode when fed with bamboo, but breed only if there is at least one [[bamboo]] plant (not including shoots) within a 7×7×3 area; otherwise the pandas briefly shake their heads and do not breed until that requirement is met. If only one panda is close to a bamboo plant, the other panda shakes its head, but a baby is born.

{{IN|bedrock}}, there must be at least 8 bamboo plants within a five-block radius of each panda in order for them to enter love mode. If a panda is fed without a sufficient amount of bamboo plants nearby, it sits and eats the bamboo instead of entering love mode.

Once pandas successfully breed, they produce a baby panda that remains neutral toward that [[player]].

Cake cannot be used to breed pandas.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Panda.png|thumb|width=165x165|A regular panda ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult panda to form a [[jockey]].

==Genetics==
Each panda has two hidden values called "{{w|Allele|genes}}" or "alleles", as found in {{w|Genetics|genetics}}. Pandas have a main gene and a hidden gene, each assigned to a particular trait. Normal, aggressive, lazy, worried, and playful personalities are dominant traits, while weak and brown personalities are recessive traits. If the main gene is a dominant gene, then it presents as the personality regardless of the hidden gene. If the main gene is recessive and the hidden gene is not the same trait, then a normal personality results. As recessive traits, weak and brown personalities occur if both the main and hidden genes of a panda are weak or brown, respectively. The hidden gene is relevant only for determining the panda's personality if the main gene is recessive.

When two pandas breed, each one passes one of their genes to their children, who then randomly mix both obtained genes as their respective main and hidden genes. There is also a {{frac|1|32}} chance for each gene of the baby to mutate into another gene. Normal, weak, and brown traits more commonly result from mutations than other traits do. These probabilities also apply to naturally spawned pandas for their main and hidden genes.

:The only way to directly observe the hidden gene of a panda (if they are not weak or brown, in which case the genes are certain) is to use the command : {{cmd|data get entity @e<nowiki>[type=minecraft:panda,limit=1]</nowiki> HiddenGene}}{{only|Java}} or using third-party NBT editors.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*To create the in-game [[sound]]s for pandas, [[Mojang Studios]]' lead sound designer, Samuel Åberg, went to {{W|Guangzhou|Guangzhou, China|newtab=1}}, to record real-life pandas.<ref>{{ytl|7mi5au5qH8g|Recording Panda sounds for Minecraft!|Minecraft|October 9, 2018}}</ref> This was also done with [[dolphin]]s.
**The fourth bleat sound is the first aggressive ambient sound, but slightly modified.
*The brown panda, known as the {{W|Qinling panda|newtab=1}}, is actually a subspecies of the giant panda discovered in the 1960s.
*On September 21, 2018, the panda won a popularity poll teasing the announcement of a Chinese "national treasure" at [[MINECON Earth 2018]]. Other options included the {{w|Chinese alligator|newtab=1}}, the {{W|golden snub-nosed monkey|newtab=1}}, the {{W|Thorold's deer|white-lipped deer|newtab=1}}, and the {{W|baiji|newtab=1}}.<ref>https://mc.163.com/pe/client/activity/voteforanimalpc/index.html</ref>
*The lazy panda is the slowest land mob in the game (not counting status effects such as [[Slowness]]).
*The rarest mob {{in|bedrock}} is a baby [[husk]] with equipment and armor riding a brown panda, which has a 2.88×10<sup>−13</sup> percent (one in 3.47<span style="text-decoration:overline">2</span> trillion) chance of spawning.
*Pandas were originally a bit slimmer.<ref>{{ytl|8jI4Qfj7U6Q|Making Mobs: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|t=165}}</ref>
