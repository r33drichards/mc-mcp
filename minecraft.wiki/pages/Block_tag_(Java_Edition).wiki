A block [[Tag (Java Edition)|tag]] is a group of [[block]]s. They are used in [[advancement]] and [[world generation]] files to determine which block types meet a condition. Some block tags enable special behavior for the contained blocks. They can also be used when testing for block arguments in commands with {{cd|#{{ph|resource location}}}}, which succeeds if the block matches any of the blocks specified in the tag.

Used in the process of determining where to put an entity when it dismounts another entity.{{more info|specifically what it affects}}

If scaffolding is removed, the player cannot smoothly climb up, but can still jump up and crouch down.

=== nylium ===
Used as a check during generation certain vegetation in crimson and warped forests.

Crimson roots, warped roots and nether sprouts can be placed on blocks in this tag, as well as soul soil.

Netherrack is a valid [[bone meal]] target only if a nearby block is in this tag, or if netherrack itself is in this tag.

A non-nylium block nearby causes bone meal to be consumed without producing anything when used on netherrack.

It is still possible to spread nylium onto netherrack even if one or both nylium blocks are removed from the tag, as long as a block in the nylium tag is still nearby. This is because the check to grow nylium on the netherrack does not use the tag.

Fungi can be placed on blocks in this tag, as well as mycelium and soul soil, as well as blocks in {{tag link|block|dirt}}, and {{cd|farmland}}.
