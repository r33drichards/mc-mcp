A '''sculk sensor''' is a [[sculk family|sculk]] block that detects [[vibration]]s caused by nearby actions and events and emits a [[redstone]] signal in response. [[Player]]-caused vibrations can also trigger nearby [[sculk shrieker]]s. {{Control|Sneaking}} prevents the creation of vibrations while moving, and [[wool]] can be used to block or prevent them. Placing an [[Block of Amethyst|amethyst block]] next to a sculk sensor allows it to "relay" detected vibrations to other sculk sensors.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A sculk sensor can be mined with any tool, but [[hoe]]s are the quickest. It drops itself only if mined with any tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. If mined with a non-Silk Touch tool, it drops 5 [[experience]] instead.

{{Breaking row|Sculk Sensor|Hoe|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Sculk sensors generate within the [[deep dark]] biome and [[ancient cities]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|sculk-sensor}}

=== Post-generation ===
A [[sculk catalyst]] has a 9% chance of generating a sculk sensor on top of a [[sculk]] block.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
Sculk sensors can be used to craft [[calibrated sculk sensor]]s.

{{crafting usage}}

=== Light ===
A sculk sensor has a [[light level]] of 1. When active, it changes to a lighter block state without a change to the light level.

=== Vibration detection ===
[[File:Vibration JE1 BE1.gif|thumb|The sculk sensor vibration [[particle]].]]
Sculk sensors detect vibrations in an 8 block spherical radius around it. Vibrations are caused by various events, such as players and mobs walking, placing or breaking blocks (except [[wool]] or [[carpet]]), gliding with [[elytra]], items falling on the ground, shooting projectiles, a [[piston]] extending or a wet [[wolf]] shaking itself off. Vibrations have an associated frequency; different events create vibrations of different frequencies.

When a vibration is made within the range of a sculk sensor, a signal travels from the vibration source to the sensor at a speed of one block per [[game tick]] (20 blocks per second). When the signal arrives, the sensor is activated for {{convert|30|game tick|second}}. The sensor cannot detect any other vibrations while activated or while a signal is traveling to it.

Sculk sensors have a cooldown period of {{convert|10|game tick|second}} after being placed or after deactivating. During this cooldown period, they cannot detect vibrations. This prevents a sensor from reactivating when a contraption it is powering (such as a piston) becomes unpowered.

Sculk sensors don't detect vibrations from other sculk sources or the [[warden]] in ''[[Java Edition]]''.

;Sneaking
While [[sneaking]], a player is not detected while performing most actions corresponding to vibration frequencies 1, 2, or 3, such as moving, hitting the ground without taking damage, interacting with items, and shooting projectiles (although the projectile itself creates a vibration when it hits the ground).

;Wool occlusion
[[Wool]] and [[carpet]]s have a special interaction with sculk sensors. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect the placed wool nor vibrations behind it. Specifically, if the ray joining the cube centers of the sensor block and the vibration source passes through any wool blocks, the vibration is occluded. If the ray passes diagonally through the edge between two blocks, either one or the other block may occlude it but not both. Sculk sensors are not able to detect footsteps or dropped items on wool or carpet, placement or breaking of wool or carpet,  or wool or carpets dropping as [[item (entity)|items]].

;Sculk shriekers
Sculk sensors pass on the vibrations made by players to [[sculk shrieker]]s within 8 blocks of the sensor. For example, an item dropped by a player triggers the shrieker, but an item dropped by a dispenser or from a broken block does not; a player flying around with elytra triggers the shrieker, but a [[bat]] flying around does not. Alarms can be blocked by wool placed in between the sensor and shrieker, similar to how wool can block vibrations from reaching the sensor itself.

=== Redstone emission ===
[[File:SculkSensorPower.png|thumb|An activated Sculk Sensor. Only the block ''below'' the sensor is strongly powered. All other sides react as though the sensor itself were strongly powered.]]
Sculk sensors emit a [[redstone]] signal  in every direction (including top and bottom) when they are activated. The redstone signal emitted from the bottom [[Redstone mechanics#Powered blocks|powers]] the block below the sensor strongly, whereas in all other directions it appears as though the sensor itself is the strongly powered block.

The strength of the redstone signal is {{w|inversely proportional}} to the distance the vibration signal traveled – the closer the vibration is to the sculk sensor, the stronger the redstone signal is, so it reaches the maximum redstone signal strength when the vibration is directly on top of the sensor. The distance is measured from the block at which the vibration occurred; moving within a block never results in a different strength.

<code>redstone_strength = max(1, 15 - floor(15 / detection_range * distance))</code>

==== Vibration frequencies ====

{{main|Vibration}}
{{:Vibration}}

==== Vibration resonance ====
When a sculk sensor detects a vibration, any adjacent [[block of amethyst]] re-emits a vibration of the same frequency that the sculk sensor detected, which can be detected by other sensors and [[calibrated sculk sensors]].

==== Things which are not detected ====
The following occurrences, despite presumably causing physical motion, do not produce vibrations and therefore cannot be detected: 
*Blocks destroyed by a fluid flowing into their space<ref>{{bug|MC-207410}}</ref>
*Several blocks being destroyed due to their supporting block being removed:<ref>{{bug|MC-207411}}</ref>
**Rails
**Powered rails
**Detector rails
**Activator rails
**Redstone wire
**Redstone repeaters
**Redstone comparators
*Several cases where a [[dispenser]] fails to perform an action:<ref>{{bug|MC-208142}}</ref>
**Flint and steel not creating fire
**Bone meal not growing something
**Heads and carved pumpkins, if not equipped on something or placed
**Shulker boxes, if not placed
**Shears, if there's nothing to shear
**Glowstone, if it doesn't charge a respawn anchor
*Inserting an [[eye of ender]] into an [[end portal frame]]<ref>{{bug|MC-208805}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-209798}}</ref>
*Eyes of ender breaking<ref>{{bug|MC-210153}}</ref>
*[[Silverfish]] entering blocks<ref>{{bug|MC-210283}}</ref>
*[[Water]] and [[lava]] flowing into existing spaces, or drying up<ref>{{bug|MC-210482}}</ref>
*Changing the mode of a [[redstone comparator]]<ref>{{bug|MC-211331}}</ref>
*Changing the delay on a [[redstone repeater]]<ref>{{bug|MC-214621}}</ref>
*Changing the shape of a single unit of [[redstone wire]]<ref>{{bug|MC-214623}}</ref>
*[[Fire]] extinguished by rain<ref>{{bug|MC-251525}}</ref>

The following cases have been confirmed to be intentional: 
*[[Axolotl]]s being bred via tropical fish buckets<ref name="axo-bucket">{{bug|MC-208799|||WAI}}</ref>
*[[Moss block]]s replacing existing blocks<ref>{{bug|MC-214210|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Piston interactivity ===
Sculk sensors are immovable. [[Piston]]s cannot push them, and sticky pistons cannot push or pull them. [[Slime block]]s and [[honey block]]s do not stick to sculk sensors and have no effect whether the slime block or honey block is being pushed or pulled.

== Sounds ==
A sculk sensor is silent if [[waterlogged]]. It can still detect vibration, but does not produce sounds itself.

== Trivia ==
* "Sculk" is derived from "[[wiktionary:skulk#English|skulk]]", meaning "keep out of sight, typically with a sinister or cowardly motive".<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1316040636538204160|While not related, Sculk name was inspired by Jeb's process with naming the Shulkers - he liked the word "Lurker", but changed it around a bit to feel new. Sculk is one letter changed in Skulk, meaning 'keep out of sight, typically with a sinister or cowardly motive'|October 13, 2020}}</ref>
* In one of the early "hollowed" concepts of the sculk sensor, it used to require 4 vibrations before it would emit a redstone signal, indicated by the markings on the top texture, which would light up for each vibration received and would slowly go down over time.<ref>{{Tweet|CagilMartin|1540933520268607490|This is how the old sculk sensor worked Source: Minecraft Ideas Academy discord|June 26, 2022}}</ref>
