'''Pointed dripstone''' is a block that makes up stalactites and stalagmites.

'''Stalactites''' (which point ''{{tooltip|downward|Here's a mnemonic device: 'If you fall from a *tite*-rope...'}}'') can be used as falling projectiles, to renewably drip [[water]] and [[lava]] into [[cauldron]]s and to convert [[mud]] into [[clay]].

'''Stalagmites''' (which point ''{{tooltip|upward|Here's a mnemonic device: <nowiki>'...Be careful what you *mite* land on.'</nowiki>}}'') deal extra damage to [[player]]s and [[mob]]s that land on them.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Pointed dripstone can be mined with any tool,<ref>{{bug|MC-242733||Pointed dripstone drops an item when broken without a tool|WAI}}</ref> but [[pickaxe]]s are the quickest. Pointed dripstone breaks instantly when hit by a thrown [[trident]]. However, it cannot be broken with any other projectile.

{{Breaking row|Pointed Dripstone|Pickaxe|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Pointed dripstone can be found in [[dripstone caves]] in [[Dripstone (feature)|cluster]] formations. It also generates in [[trial chambers]] (a trapped variant of spiral staircases, as well as the "Encounter 4" room).

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 2 pointed dripstones for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Dripstone farming}}

Pointed dripstone can grow only if it is hanging directly under a [[dripstone block]] while there is a [[water]] source above (not a [[waterlogged]] block). In addition, if there is a solid block less than eleven blocks below this stalactite, a stalagmite grows on that block toward the stalactite. This growth does not occur if the stalactite's tip is waterlogged and a stalagmite below does not grow if its tip is waterlogged. They do not grow to more than seven blocks long.

Every time the block receives a [[random tick]], there is a small chance of 1.138% ({{frac|64|5625}}) for a stalactite or stalagmite to grow one block, meaning that every single growth step takes an average time of 5 in-game days (100 minutes).

== Usage ==
Pointed dripstone comes in two different forms, stalactites and stalagmites. Placing a pointed dripstone between a stalagmite and stalactite without [[sneaking]] connects them. It can be [[waterlogged]]. Mobs can jump up pointed dripstone as long as its height does not exceed four blocks. [[Horse]]s and other similar mobs can travel up the same pointed dripstone as if they were stairs.

=== Stalactites ===
[[File:Stalactite.png|thumb|upright=0.5|A stalactite.]]
Stalactites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the bottom of a block.

Stalactites less than 11 blocks tall passively drip water [[particle]]s (or lava particles in [[the Nether]]) in the absence of a liquid source, but these particles do not fill cauldrons. A waterlogged pointed dripstone at the tip of a stalactite does not produce drip particles. Waterlogging other parts of the stalactite does not affect the dripping.

If the block supporting a stalactite or any block of the stalactite is broken, all of the unsupported pointed dripstone below the broken block drops, causing damage to any player and mobs standing beneath it, similar to a falling [[anvil]]. After 2 blocks' falling, the amount of damage is {{hp|1}} per pointed dripstone falling (less than 6 will be count as 6) per each block of falling distance in Java Edition, or {{hp|1}} per each block of falling distance in Bedrock Edition<ref>{{Bug|MCPE-184329|3=Falling stalactite does 1 damage per block fallen instead of 6}}</ref>. (e.g., one single pointed dripstone that falls 4 blocks deals {{hp|18}} damage). The damage is capped at {{Hp|40}}, no matter how far the stalactite falls. Wearing a [[helmet]] reduces the damage by <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>, but this costs twice as much durability on the helmet as on other armor pieces. When a player dies by a stalactite falling on them, the [[death message]] '''"&lt;''player''> was skewered by a falling stalactite"''' appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling stalactite entity, no damage is dealt unless the stalactite hits the ground in the same block where the player is located. Stalactites with multiple pointed dripstone can cause multiple damage; however, [[damage immunity]] prevents most of the damage from additional blocks.

==== Cauldrons ====
When the uppermost block of a stalactite less than 11 blocks tall gets [[random tick|randomly ticked]], it checks for a waterlogged block{{only|JE}} or water source two blocks above it and a [[cauldron]] within 10 blocks under the tip with no non-air blocks in between. {{IN|je}}, open [[trapdoor]]s, [[ladder]]s and blocks with no [[hitbox|collision box]] are also allowed.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-179085||Lava or water source above Dripstone doesn't fill a Cauldron with an open Trapdoor on it}}</ref> If both conditions are satisfied, there is a {{frac|45|256}} (~17.6%) chance for it to drip water and fill the cauldron by one level. If there is a lava source above the stalactite, there is a {{frac|15|256}} (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron with lava instead, making lava a [[renewable resource]]. Refilling a cauldron with water or lava averages nearly one ''Minecraft'' day (19+ minutes) although the actual time for any individual refill varies.

==== Converting mud into clay ====
If [[mud]] is placed above a block with a stalactite underneath, the mud eventually turns into [[clay]]. There is a {{frac|44|256}} (~17.2%) chance of this happening when the block gets [[random tick|randomly ticked]]. This conversion does not happen in the Nether.<ref>{{bug|MC-264720||Mud does not convert to clay in Nether with dripstone|WAI}}</ref>

=== Stalagmites ===
[[File:Stalagmite.png|thumb|upright=0.5|A stalagmite.]]
Stalagmites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the ground.

Falling onto the top most block of a stalagmite multiplies the fall distance by two to calculate the total amount of fall damage, using the formula <code>ceil(fall_distance &times; 2 &minus; 2)</code>. A [[player]] or [[mob]] gets {{hp|1}} damage each time they jump on top of a single stalagmite (with a normal jump height of {{frac|1|1|4}} blocks). The distance traveled during the last [[game tick]] of falling time is not included in this calculation, making it slightly off at higher distances; see {{slink|Damage|Fall damage}} for more information.

If a player dies from falling onto a stalagmite, the [[death message]] '''"<''player''> was impaled on a stalagmite"''' appears.

All mobs that are immune to fall damage do not take damage from falling into stalagmites; the same applies to the player if the [[game rule]] <code>fallDamage</code> is set to <code>false</code>.<ref>{{bug|MC-206555||Some mobs don't take damage from stalagmites|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-206674||Stalagmites cause no damage to the player when the gamerule "fallDamage" is set to false|WAI}}</ref>

It is possible to climb up portions of stalagmites entirely composed of differently sized parts because of the different collision box sizes of the pointed dripstone that it composes of.

=== Columns ===
[[File:Dripstone Column.png|thumb|right|A naturally generated dripstone column.]]

Dripstone columns can be found naturally in [[dripstone caves]], they are formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together in mid-air.  When grown, they stop where they join (unlike in real life).

Columns can be created manually by stacking pointed dripstones on either the stalactite or the stalagmite or both until they join together, the last pointed dripstone placed being the most slender part of the whole column. Based on the direction of the last block placed, the shape of the column's slender part can vary.
