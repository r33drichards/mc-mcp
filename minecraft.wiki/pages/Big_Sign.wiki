A '''big sign''' is an obsolete three block wide version of a [[sign]]. It was obtainable in ''[[MinecraftEdu]]'' by placing a sign and selecting the Big sign option in the GUI.

== Usage ==
The big sign functioned effectively the same as a regular sign, however the model was stretched to the width of three blocks. The big sign allowed for more characters to be included per line, due to the increased width.
