The '''taiga mountains''' or '''taiga mutated''' was a rare variant of the [[taiga]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed {{in|je}}. 

== Description ==
The terrain in taiga mountains was much steeper than in the regular taiga and [[taiga hills]], with peaks occasionally crossing the snowfall line, making this a more difficult variant among the taiga family. However, it wasn't as mountainuous as the [[Windswept Hills|windswept hills]].

[[Village]]s and [[Pillager Outpost|pillager outposts]] didn't generate in this biome, though wolves and foxes still spawned.

== Mobs ==
Taiga mountains used the same mob spawning chances as taigas.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
