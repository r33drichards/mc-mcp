{{Animate|s=Item|Nautilus Spawn Egg;Zombie Nautilus Spawn Egg;Parched Spawn Egg;Camel Husk Spawn Egg|32|class=pixel-image}} '''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* Added nautilus, zombie nautilus, parched, and camel husk spawn eggs.

{{Animate|Wooden Spear.png;Stone Spear.png;Copper Spear.png;Iron Spear.png;Golden Spear.png;Diamond Spear.png;Netherite Spear.png|32px|class=pixel-image}} '''[[Spear]]'''
* New weapon that can be crafted in [[Wooden Spear|wood]], [[Stone Spear|stone]], [[Copper Spear|copper]], [[Iron Spear|iron]], [[Golden Spear|gold]], [[Diamond Spear|diamond]] and [[Netherite Spear|netherite]] versions.
** Each material has different stats for timing, influencing how fast they are to use.
** Copper, iron and golden spears can be smelted into the respective [[nugget]]s.
** Wooden spears can be used as a fuel in a [[furnace]].
* Cannot be used to mine blocks, as opposed to other weapons.
* Can be enchanted with the exclusive enchantment [[Lunge]], in addition to the available enchantments for [[sword]]s (except [[Sweeping Edge]]).
* Has a minimum reach for damage, being too close to a target will yield no damage.
** Has extended maximum reach compared to other tools and weapons.
* [[Zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s and [[piglin]]s can spawn holding a spear.
** Golden spears are a [[piglin]]-preferred weapon.
* Has two attacks: jab and charge.
** Jab
*** Used by quick-pressing the {{control|attack|text=primary action button}}.
*** Is a low-damage attack with knockback.
*** Has a cooldown between attacks.
*** Wooden spears have the fastest cooldown, while netherite has the slowest.
*** Can hit multiple enemies.
** Charge
*** Used by holding the {{control|use|text=secondary action button}}.
*** Damage is based on spear material, the player’s view angle, and the velocity of both the player and the target.
*** While holding down the button, the attack goes through three stages before returning to idle:
**** Engaged: The spear can deal damage, knockback, and dismount mounted enemies if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Tired: Indicated by the spear rotating to a vertical position and shaking. The Spear can deal damage and knockback (but not dismount) if the speed is above the required thresholds.
**** Disengaged: Indicated by the spear being lowered, pointing downwards. The Spear gives damage but not knockback or dismount if the speed is above the required threshold.
*** The spear's range when used by mobs is half of that when used by players, but they can deal damage, dismount and knockback at lower speeds than the players.
*** Spears provide visual feedback when they hit a target in the charge attack.

* Syntax:
** {{cmd|stopwatch create <id>}} &ndash; creates a stopwatch with the given namespaced ID.
** {{cmd|stopwatch query <id>}} &ndash; returns the queried value and takes in a new {{cd|scale}} argument.
*** The returned value will be scaled by that argument and truncated.
*** The scale is optional and will default to {{cd|1}} if omitted.
*** Example: {{cmd|stopwatch query foo:bar 20}} to get the elapsed time in ticks.
** {{cmd|stopwatch restart <id>}} &ndash; restarts the given stopwatch.
** {{cmd|stopwatch remove <id>}} &ndash; removes the given stopwatch.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancements]]'''
* Added the following advancement:

* [[Lunge]]
** A new enchantment that is unique to the [[spear]].
** Only works with the jab attack.
** When doing a jab attack with Lunge, it propels the player horizontally in the view direction.
** The view angle needs to be perfectly leveled horizontally to achieve maximum lunge distance.
** Costs saturation/hunger to use, similar to sprinting or jumping.
*** Level I consumes {{hunger|1}}, level II consumes {{hunger|2}}, and level III consumes {{hunger|3}}.
*** Lunge can only be used if the player has at least {{hunger|6}} hunger points in their hunger bar.
** There's also a durability cost of 1 for using [[Lunge]] across all Enchantment levels.

=== General ===
'''[[Environment attribute]]s'''
{{collapse|
content=
* Provides a data-driven way to control a variety of visual and gameplay systems.
* Each Environment Attribute controls a specific visual or gameplay effect: 
** For example, {{cd|minecraft:visual/sky_color}} controls the color of the sky, and {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates}} controls whether water can be placed at a given location.

* Sources
** Environment Attribute values can be provided by the following Environment Attribute sources (in order of low to high priority):
*** Dimensions
*** Biomes
** The "effective" value of the Environment Attribute (i.e. what will actually show up in game) will be some combination of the values provided by each source according to their priority.
*** For example, in the following scenario:
**** The overworld dimension provides <code>sky_color = #00ff00</code> (green)
**** The plains biome provides <code>sky_color = #ff0000</code> (red)
*** When the player is in the plains biome, they will see the red {{cd|sky_color}}, while anywhere else in the overworld they will see green.
** When an Environment Attribute source provides an Environment Attribute, it can:
*** Override the value, such as the plains biome overriding the overworld's {{cd|sky_color}} in the above scenario.
*** Apply a modifier to a previous value.

* Modifiers
** An environment attribute source may simply override the value of a particular attribute. 
*** However, it is sometimes also desirable to rather apply a modifier to a value provided by a source with lower priority.
*** For example, in the following scenario:
**** The overworld dimension provides <code>water_fog_radius = 96.0</code>
**** The plains biome modifies {{cd|water_fog_radius}} with a multiply modifier of {{cd|0.85}}
*** When in the plains biome, the {{cd|water_fog_radius}} will be resolved to <math>96.0*0.85 = 81.6</math>, while in any other Overworld biome, it will resolve to {{cd|96.0}}.
** The kinds of modifiers available depends on the type of Environment Attribute. 
*** The most basic modifier, supported by every Environment Attribute, is the override modifier. 
*** This behaves purely as an override of the preceding value. 
**** If not specified by an Environment Attribute source, the modifier will always be assumed to be override.

* Interpolation
** Interpolation describes the combination of values within a source. 
** Is performed on values from a source after modifiers have been applied.
** Only some Environment Attributes support interpolation. This allows for the smooth transition between two or more values, such as when moving between two biomes.
** Biomes
*** {{cd|sky_color}} is one attribute that will transition smoothly based on position.
*** For example, in the following scenario:
**** The plains biome provides <code>sky_color = #ff0000</code> (red)
**** The desert biome provides <code>sky_color = #ffff00</code> (yellow)
*** In the above scenario, as a player moves from a plains to a desert biome, the sky color will gradually shift from red to yellow. 
*** Other attributes, such as {{cd|water_evaporates}}, represent discrete values and will not be smoothly transitioned &ndash; only the biome exactly at a subject position will be considered.
*** Smooth transitions between biomes are based on the biomes within an 8 block radius of the camera. Biomes that occupy a larger portion of that radius and are closer to the camera will have a stronger influence on the final interpolated value.

* Environment Attribute Map
** Dimension Type and Biome definitions contain a new attributes field, enabling them to define Environment Attributes.
** This map generally takes the form of an object mapping between Environment Attribute IDs and their corresponding values, for example:
<code>"attributes": {
"minecraft:visual/fog_color": "#ffaa00",
"minecraft:gameplay/water_evaporates": true
}</code>
* Values defined as above will always be assumed to use the override modifier.
** The value object can however be expanded in order to express different modifiers, in the format of an object with the following fields:
*** {{cd|modifier}}: optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type.
**** Default: {{cd|override}}
*** {{cd|argument}}: the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier).
**** How the argument is used also depends on the type of modifier.
*** For example, the following definition describes multiplying {{cd|water_fog_radius}} by 85%:
<code>"attributes": {
"minecraft:visual/water_fog_radius": {
"modifier": "multiply",
"argument": 0.85
}
}</code>

* Common Data Types
** The following data types are reused in various parts of the Environment Attributes system.
** RGB Color
*** Format can be one of the following:
**** A hex color RGB string, in the form {{cd|#rrggbb}}
**** A float array with 3 components, between {{cd|0}} and {{cd|1}}, in the form {{cd|[r, g, b]}}
**** An integer in packed RGB form.
** ARGB Color
*** Format can be one of the following:
**** A hex color ARGB string, in the form {{cd|#aarrggbb}}
**** A float array with 4 components, between {{cd|0}} and {{cd|1}}, in the form {{cd|[a, r, g, b]}}
**** An integer in packed ARGB form.
** Particle Options
*** A full definition of a particle, including any type-specific properties (as in the /particle command).
**** For example:
<code>{
"type": "minecraft:block_crumble",
"block_state": {
"Name": "minecraft:dirt"
}
}</code>

* Common Modifiers
* Every Environment Attribute has a specific value type, which describes how values must be defined as well as what modifiers are available and how they are interpolated. 
** Some are very specific, while others are reused across many attributes.
** Modifiers on Boolean Values
*** Argument format: boolean
**** {{cd|override}}
**** {{cd|and}}
**** {{cd|nand}}
**** {{cd|or}}
**** {{cd|nor}}
**** {{cd|xor}}
**** {{cd|xnor}}
** Modifiers on Float Values
*** Argument format: float
**** {{cd|override}}
**** {{cd|add}}
**** {{cd|subtract}}
**** {{cd|multiply}}
**** {{cd|minimum}}
**** {{cd|maximum}}
** Modifiers on Color Values
*** Argument format: RGB color (except {{cd|alpha_blend}})
**** {{cd|override}}
**** {{cd|add}} &ndash; component-wise additive color blending
**** {{cd|subtract}} &ndash; component-wise subtractive color blending..
**** {{cd|multiply}} &ndash; component-wise multiplicative color blending.
**** {{cd|alpha_blend}} &ndash; traditional alpha blending that might be seen in image editing software.
***** Argument format: ARGB Color
***** When the argument alpha is {{cd|1}}, it will behave as an override with no blending.
** Modifiers on ARGB Color Values
*** {{cd|override}}
**** Argument format: ARGB Color
*** {{cd|add}} &ndash; component-wise additive color blending.
**** Argument format: RGB Color
*** {{cd|subtract}} &ndash; component-wise subtractive color blending.
**** Argument format: RGB Color
*** {{cd|multiply}} &ndash; component-wise multiplicative color blending.
**** Argument format: RGB or ARGB Color
**** If specified, the alpha component is multiplied independently just like the other color channels.
*** {{cd|alpha_blend}} &ndash; traditional alpha blending that might be seen in image editing software.
**** Argument format: ARGB Color
**** When the argument alpha is {{cd|1}}, it will behave as an override with no blending.

'''[[Loot functions]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:discard}}
** Replaces any item stack with empty one.
** No fields.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added the anisotropic filtering graphics option.
** This new option improves the visual quality of blocks when viewed at a distance or at an angle.
** The default depends on the graphics preset, and the values are "off", "2x", "4x", and "8x".
** If the hardware does not support it, it will not be used.
** This significantly impacts video memory usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count).

* Added the chunk fade time option.
** Located in Video Settings.
** Controls the fade-in time of [[chunk]]s.

[[File:1.21.11-pre1 VV Java Tech changelog.png|300px|thumb|An announcement on Rotated Grid Super Sampling.]]
* Added texture filtering in video settings.
** Controls the method used to sample textures when they are viewed at an angle or from a distance.
** Available values are "None", "RGSS", and "Anisotropic".
** The default depends on the selected graphics preset as well as the computer's graphics card capabilities.{{note|AMD GPUs use "RGSS" on the "Fabulous!" preset instead of "Anisotropic" as using "Anisotropic" on AMD GPUs does not perform well.<ref>{{Cite Discord

** "RGSS" (Rotated Grid Super Sampling) is a shader-based filtering method that improves texture clarity at a moderate performance cost.
*** This is available on all hardware.
** "Anisotropic" is a hardware-based filtering method that improves texture clarity even further.
*** The maximum anisotropy may be "2x", "4x", and "8x", controllable by a separate slider.
*** If the graphics card does not support it, anisotropic filtering will do nothing.
*** This significantly impacts [[w:Video random-access memory|VRAM]] usage (especially combined with a high mipmap count).

*** {{cd|period_ticks}}: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat.
**** If not specified, the timeline will not repeat
*** {{cd|tracks}}: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object.
* Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension.
* With the inclusion of Timelines, Environment Attribute sources are processed in the following order (from low to high priority):
** Dimensions
** Biomes
** Timelines
** Weather (not data-driven)
* Interpolation
** Timelines can define Attribute Tracks 
*** These specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. 
*** Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.
** For example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:
*** At time = {{cd|0}}, the timeline provides {{cd|sky_color {{=}} #ff0000}} (red)
*** At time = {{cd|1000}}, the timeline provides {{cd|sky_color {{=}} #ff0000}} (red)
*** At time = {{cd|6000}}, the timeline provides {{cd|sky_color {{=}} #ff00ff}} (magenta)
** Between time = {{cd|0}} and time = {{cd|1000}}, the sky color will be red. Between {{cd|1000}} and {{cd|6000}}, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from {{cd|6000}} all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = {{cd|0}} again, the color will slowly shift back to red.
** Unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.
* Attribute Tracks
** An Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:
*** {{cd|ease}} &ndash; optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes.
**** Default: linear
***** If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect.
*** {{cd|keyframes}} &ndash; list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field:
**** {{cd|ticks}} &ndash; integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe's value will be active.
**** {{cd|value}} &ndash; the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier).
***** If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself.
***** How this value is used depends on the type of modifier.
****** Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition.
*** {{cd|modifier}} &ndash; optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below).
**** Default: override
** For example, the following Timeline has a period of {{cd|24000}}, and has an attribute track that modifies only {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance}}. Because the easing is constant, between tick {{cd|362}} and {{cd|23667}} the value is {{cd|0.0}}, while between tick {{cd|23667}} and {{cd|362}} it is {{cd|0.7}}.
** Like other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified {{cd|modifier}}. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is {{cd|maximum}}, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of {{cd|cat_waking_up_gift_chance}} to the value specified in the track.

'''[[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]]'''
* The version is now 2.0.0.
* Added a new notification server/activity.
** Indicates that a network connection to the server has been initiated.
** Rate limited to 1 notification per 30 seconds.
* Enable authentication from web browsers.
** Authenticate by passing the token in <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</code> header when opening the WebSocket connection.
*** Example: <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: minecraft-v1, <token></code>
** Requests authenticating this way are subject to Origin header checks. This requires configuration of allowed origins on the server side using <code>management-server-allowed-origins</code>. The default value is empty, meaning <code>Sec-Websocket-Protocol</code> authentication is effectively disabled.
* In the {{cd|typed_game_rule}} and {{cd|untyped_game_rule}} schemas, the type of the value field has been changed from string to take either a boolean or an integer.
** It now uses the game rule resource location as the key.

'''[[Mob variant definitions]]'''
* Zombie Nautilus Variants
** Zombie Nautilus variants can be data-driven by adding entries to <samp>data/<namespace>/zombie_nautilus_variant/<id>.json</samp>
*** This feature is experimental.
*** Fields in file:
**** {{cd|model}} &ndash; one of: normal, warm
**** {{cd|asset_id}} &ndash; namespaced id for this variant asset, resolves to <samp>assets/<namespace>/textures/<path>.png</samp>
**** {{cd|spawn_conditions}} &ndash; a uniform variant selection rule.
** Spawn conditions
*** {{cd|minecraft:biome}}
**** Checks if entity is spawning in specific biomes.
**** Fields:
***** {{cd|biomes}} &ndash; single entry, list or a tag describing biomes.
*** {{cd|minecraft:moon_brightness}}
**** Checks if current moon brightness is within certain range.
**** Fields:
***** range &ndash; floating point range (a single number or an object like {{cd|{"min": 1, "max": 2})}}
*** {{cd|minecraft:structures}}
**** Checks if entity is spawning in specific structures.
**** Fields:
***** {{cd|structures}} &ndash; single entry, list or a tag describing structures.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Renamed the "Show Music Toast" option to "Music Toast".
** Added a third state to the "Music Toast" option, allowing it to only be shown in the pause menu.

'''[[Panorama]]'''
* Updated the panorama to resemble [[Mounts of Mayhem]].

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Component Predicates
** Component predicates (predicates field in block, item and entity predicates) now include predicates for checking existence of every component type.
** Those predicates are written as <code>{<component_type>: {}}</code>.
** Such predicate check passes as long as component is present, no matter the actual value.
** Existing predicates for specific components remain unchanged.
** Example:
*** <code>{predicates:{written_book_content:{author:"foo"}}</code> &ndash; existing format for matching books.
*** <code>{predicates:{written_book_content:{}}</code> &ndash; special case of above that accepted any value, as long as component existed.
*** <code>{predicates:{instrument:{}}</code> &ndash; checks if component <code>minecraft:instrument</code> exists (was not allowed before).

* Entity Predicates
** The {{cd|flags}} predicate now supports new values:
*** {{cd|is_in_water}}: when an entity is touching [[water]] or a [[bubble column]].
*** {{cd|is_fall_flying}}: when an entity is gliding with an [[elytra]].

* Item Predicates
** Item predicate in command form (<code><item>[predicate~{...},component={...}]</code>) has been extended to accept empty predicates for any component type.
** Similarly to component predicates in data, those empty entries only check for component existence.
** Existing shorter syntax for checking component existence remains unchanged.
*** That means {{cd|*[instrument]}} and {{cd|*[instrument~{}]}} are equivalent.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|75.0}}.
* <samp>block.vsh/fsh</samp> copies <samp>terrain.vsh/fsh</samp> and handles ad-hoc blocks (e.g. held by entities).
* Added {{cd|ChunkSection}} uniform, used by <samp>terrain.vsh</samp> (which replaces {{cd|DynamicTransforms}}).
* New shaders have been introduced to perform GPU based sprite animations.
* {{cd|Globals}} uniform now has camera coordinates.
* <samp>terrain</samp> core shader now samples the blocks atlas texture linearly instead of with nearest neighbour
* Block model and state format has been expanded to allow more rotations.

'''[[Server]]'''
* Added ClientFps JFR event.
* Experience packets that do not change the player's experience progress or level are no longer sent by the server.
* Client FPS is expected to be higher for most players.

'''[[Settings]]'''
* Graphics modes "Fast", "Fancy", and "Fabulous!" have been replaced with graphics presets with the same names.
* Settings on the Video Settings screen have been reordered and split into 3 sections: "Display", "Quality & Performance", and "Interface".
** The following settings that have been removed from the Video Settings screen, because were duplicating accessibility settings:
*** "View Bobbing"
*** "Glint Speed"
*** "Glint Strength"
*** "FOV Effects"
*** "Distortion Effects"
** Tweaks that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting have been split out to be configurable independently:
*** "See-Through Leaves"
*** "Show Vignette"
*** "Weather Effect Radius" 
**** Configures the distance in blocks within which rain and snow are visible.
*** "Improved Transparency" 
**** Resolves some of the transparent geometry rendering issues at a significant GPU cost, previously was hidden behind "Fabulous!".
** A new "Preset" slider was added to the top of the "Quality & Performance" section.
*** Presets control most of the "Quality & Performance" settings at once, not only the ones that were previously hidden behind the "Graphics" setting.
*** Available presets are "Fast", "Fancy", "Fabulous!" and "Custom"
*** The default preset is "Fancy" for new players.
*** But for players who are upgrading to this version the preset will be set to "Custom" to preserve the current configuration.

'''[[Shaders]] & Post-process Effects'''
* Added {{cd|animate_sprite*}} core shaders, which use a new {{cd|SpriteAnimationInfo}} uniform.

'''[[Sounds]]'''
* [[Anvil]] destroy, land, place and use sounds now play at a slightly lower volume.

'''Sprite Animations'''
* Sprites (textures as part of a larger atlas) are now animated on the GPU rather than per-tick on the CPU.
* For regular frame-based animations, <samp>animate_sprite.vsh</samp> and <samp>animate_sprite_blit.fsh</samp> are used to perform the draw.
* For interpolated animations, <samp>animate_sprite.vsh</samp> and <samp>animate_sprite_interpolate.fsh</samp> are used to perform the draw.
* The UBO {{cd|SpriteAnimationInfo}} contains information on where the sprite should be drawn to, within the greater texture atlas.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:nautilus_one_cm}} statistic (Distance By Nautilus).

'''[[Tag (Java Edition)|Tags]]'''
* Biome Tags
** Removed {{cd|d=and|#snow_golem_melts|#increased_fire_burnout}} &ndash; replaced by {{cd|d=and|gameplay/snow_golem_melts|gameplay/increased_fire_burnout}} Environment Attributes.
** Removed {{cd|#plays_underwater_music}} &ndash; replaced by {{cd|only_underwater}} field in the {{cd|audio/background_music}} Environment Attribute.

** Renamed {{cd|#swords}} to {{cd|#enchantable/melee_weapon}} from {{cd|#enchantable/sharp_weapon}} tag.

'''[[Texture atlas]]es'''
* Item textures were split out of the blocks atlas into a separate new items atlas that does not have mipmaps.
** All textures used in an item model have to come from the same (items or blocks) atlas.
** All textures used in a block model have to come from the blocks atlas.
** Commands that were referencing the blocks atlas for item textures now need to reference the items atlas instead.
* To prepare for future work, the game will now print a warning if any defined sprites in any atlases share a name.

* <samp>[[celestials.png-atlas]]</samp>
** A new celestials atlas has been introduced, including sprites for objects rendered in the sky such as the Sun and Moon.
** Includes sprites from <samp><namespace>:textures/environment/celestial/<path>.png</samp>
** The following textures have been moved or split:
*** <samp>textures/environment/sun.png</samp> -> <samp>sun</samp>
*** <samp>textures/environment/end_flash.png</samp> -> <samp>end_flash</samp>
*** <samp>textures/environment/moon_phases</samp> -> <samp>moon/full_moon</samp>, <samp>moon/waning_gibbous</samp>, <samp>moon/third_quarter</samp>, <samp>moon/waning_crescent</samp>, <samp>moon/new_moon</samp>, <samp>moon/waxing_crescent</samp>, <samp>moon/first_quarter</samp>, <samp>moon/waxing_gibbous</samp>

'''[[Textures]]'''
* All blocks in the world now have mipmaps applied if enabled in video settings.
** Blocks that did not have mipmaps before, such as different vines, rails, foliage (apart from leaves) and more should look better from higher distances.
* Only mipmaps of level 0 and 1 are now animated for block animated textures.
* [[Glass]] and [[glass panes]] now support translucent textures.
* All mipmap levels are once again animated for block animated textures.
* Beacon and redstone dust now support translucent textures.
* Textures used for still water and lava are now hardcoded to {{cd|minecraft:block/water_still}} and {{cd|minecraft:block/lava_still}}.
* Beacons no longer support translucent textures.
* Added <samp>gui/container/nautilus</samp> used for the Nautilus inventory UI.

* {{cd|texture}} section of {{cd|*.mcmeta}} files has a new field {{cd|mipmap_strategy}} with the following supported values:
** {{cd|mean}} averages both color and alpha between groups of four pixels for the current mipmap level to generate the next mipmap level pixel. This was and stays the default strategy for most solid or translucent full block textures.
** {{cd|dark_cutout}} is similar to {{cd|mean}}, but blends colors in a way that makes the pixels bordering cutout pixels darker. This was and stays the strategy for leaves and mangrove roots. It simulates dark interior of the blocks.
** {{cd|cutout}} is a new strategy that always generates a mipmap based on the original texture instead of the previous mipmap. Used for most cutout blocks that became mipmapped in this version.
** {{cd|strict_cutout}} is a modification of {{cd|cutout}} that uses stricter alpha cutoff value leading to the textures using this value disappearing at higher mipmap levels. Is used for flowers and similar blocks to avoid artifacts.
** {{cd|auto}} is the default value and will make the game to pick {{cd|mean}} for textures that do not contain fully transparent pixels and {{cd|cutout}} for those that do.

* {{cd|texture}} section of {{cd|*.mcmeta}} files has a new {{cd|alpha_cutoff_bias}} field that controls alpha bias for cutout textures.
** There is no limit for this value technically, it can be negative as well, but it does not make sense to set this higher than {{cd|1.0}} or lower than {{cd|-1.0}} since the texture will become either fully opaque or fully transparent.
** Default value for this field is {{cd|0.0}}, and it can be increased for textures that can become too transparent/thin at distance, or decreased if it's too "opaque".
** Only used for lower mips of cutout textures, does not change the alpha of first mip level, and has no effect on other textures.

'''[[UI]]'''
* Menu sliders will now "stick" to the closest available value when releasing them after dragging with a mouse.
* When using keyboard to change slider values, arrow keys will now move the slider to the next available value, not by one pixel as before.
* The inF3 button in the Debug Option screen has been renamed to inOverlay.
* "Interface" option inside the Video Settings screen has been renamed to "Preferences".
* The Single Biome Customization screen now has a search box.
* The language selection screen now has a search box to filter languages.

'''UI Sprites'''
* Added new UI sprites:
** <samp>container/slot/nautilus_armor</samp>
** <samp>container/slot/nautilus_armor_inventory</samp>
*** Nautilus icon used in Nautilus inventory UI.
** <samp>container/slot/spear</samp>
*** [[Spear]] icon used in the [[smithing table]] screen.
* Added new nine-sliced sprites:
** <samp>container/inventory/effect_background</samp>
** <samp>container/inventory/effect_background_ambient</samp>
* Removed the following sprites:
** <samp>container/inventory/effect_background_large</samp>
** <samp>container/inventory/effect_background_small</samp>
