'''Mushroom fields''' or '''mushroom islands''' are rare [[biome]]s which always generate as islands surrounded by [[deep ocean]]s. They are the only place in the game where [[mycelium]] and [[mooshroom]]s are found, and have the special property that no hostile mobs normally spawn in them.

== Description ==
Mushroom fields make up about 0.15% of the Overworld's area. They generate in areas where the [[continentalness]] values are the lowest, meaning they almost always generate as islands very far away from major landmasses, and are bordered by deep ocean biomes (which have the second-lowest continentalness values) of any temperature. The islands have the occasional tendency to be close to one another, resulting in multiple mushroom fields separated by only a few hundred blocks. It is nearly impossible for the player to spawn in the mushroom fields biome, unless there is no other spawnable biome for thousands of blocks.

The mushroom fields generate in usually flat islands and have [[mycelium]] instead of [[grass block]]s on the surface. Grass blocks that are placed by the player in this biome take on a bright green color, similar to the grass found in [[jungle]]s. A large amount of brown and red [[mushroom]]s cover the land. It is one of the only biomes, along with [[swamp]]s{{only|bedrock}} and [[dark forest]]s, where [[huge mushroom]]s generate naturally. [[Sugar cane]] and [[grass]] sometimes generate by the ocean.<ref name=bug/>

The huge mushrooms generate with a density high enough to be a reliable source of [[mushroom block]]s, but low enough not to significantly obstruct vision. Here, mushrooms can grow in full sunlight. [[Water]] is a light gray color {{in|bedrock}}.

Mushroom fields are the only biome where [[mooshroom]]s naturally spawn. Red mooshrooms, [[bat]]s{{only|java|short=1}}, and [[glow squid]]s are the only mobs that spawn naturally in this biome; this also applies in [[cave]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, and other dark structures under the island, meaning the biome is mostly safe both above and below ground.

However, [[monster spawner]]s found in mineshafts, [[monster room]]s, or [[stronghold]]s continue to spawn mobs, [[raid]]s can still spawn [[illager]]s, [[drowned]] may rarely enter the biome from the surrounding deep ocean at [[night]], [[creaking heart]]s can still spawn [[creaking]]s, and [[wandering trader]]s along with [[trader llama]]s can still spawn here. Additionally, [[lightning]] strikes can transform red mooshrooms into brown mooshrooms or vice versa. If the player has not slept in three nights, [[phantom]]s spawn in the biome as well{{Only|Java|short=JE}}<ref>{{bug|MC-126778}}</ref>. Also, [[lush caves]] can sometimes generate underground, allowing for monsters to spawn naturally.

Mushroom fields have a unique [[sky]] color with [[Vibrant Visuals]], which is yellow at the horizon and purple at zenith. Mushroom fields also have a bright purple tinted [[fog]] effect underwater and slightly stronger volumetric fog than other biomes.
<!-- Tutorial information below – Move to a page on Tutorial/Mushroom fields survival when created:

This biome is one of the toughest for survival if one does not bring resources, especially because of the extreme rarity and non-renewability of [[wood]], with [[mineshaft]]s or [[shipwreck]]s being the only sources. Once the first seven [[planks]] blocks are gathered however, [[food]] is relatively easy to collect, as mooshrooms produce [[mushroom stew]] anytime the player right-clicks them with a [[bowl]]. Lack of mobs has both beneficial and harmful consequences, as while players never have to worry about being attacked by hostile mobs at night, it also means a player cannot obtain any mob-related resources unless [[dungeon]]s happen to generate underground, and even if they generate, almost most resources are still unobtainable, and some of them are crucial for survival. As the biome is usually surrounded by water, the [[player]] can still obtain food from killing [[fish]] or fishing or farming [[kelp]] and smelting it into [[dried kelp]], and are able to use shipwrecks to obtain [[planks]]. An unprepared [[player]] must face the danger of not being able to make a [[bed]] to sleep or making [[bow]]s and [[arrow]]s to fight. -->
