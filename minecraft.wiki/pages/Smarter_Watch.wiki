The '''smarter watch''' was an offhand [[item]] present in the April Fools' snapshot [[1.RV-Pre1]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie]]s, [[Zombie Villager (old)|zombie villager]]s and [[skeleton]]s could spawn with it in their offhand slot. They had a chance{{More info|how big was the chance? was it the same as armor? was it affected by looting?}} to drop it when killed by the player.

== Usage ==
Smarter watches were "equipped" by holding them in the offhand slot. While equipped, they displayed the current time above the hotbar, in minutes and seconds, with one minute of in-game time being 5/6 of a real-time second, and one in-game hour being 5/6 of a real-time minute or 50 seconds.

The smarter watch also notified the player of statistics milestones and taken [[damage]].

When the player had achieved a statistic, the message said:

'''Notice! <Statistic> is now <number>!'''

When the player had taken damage, the message said:

'''Notice! You recently took <amount of damage taken> half hearts of damage!'''
