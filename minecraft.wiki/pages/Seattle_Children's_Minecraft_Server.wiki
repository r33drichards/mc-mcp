== Summary ==
'''Seattle Children's Minecraft Server''' is a private, [[Bedrock Edition]] minigames [[server]] based on the already established, featured server [[Featured servers|The Hive]] which includes many similar games, cosmetics and decorative features as it. 

=== The Hub ===
When players first join, they are taken to a sectioned-off hub with a linear path in which they select a randomly generated Gamertag and pick a costume. After this, they gain full access to explore the map and are introduced to the "Game Selector", "Global Locker" and "Hub Cosmetics" items. 

NPCs fill the medieval town with uniquely built houses and clocktowers, custom terrain and an explorative-feel to the hub.

Using the global locker and hub cosmetic items, players have access to costumes (custom [[skin]]s), mounts (flying vehicles), pets, and hats.

==== Parkour ====
With the hub being so expansive, there are many parkour sections to play where players are timed on how fast they reach to the end. These courses range from going into the cave to jumping onto flying platforms.

=== Minigames ===
Using the game selector item or Minigame Browser NPC, players are able to teleport to different minigames.

==== Sky Battle ====
Sky Battle is a take on the classic SkyWars with "lucky ores." By its nature, it's in free-for-all format with the final player alive being the winner. Before each game starts, players are able to vote on 6 random maps.
Each ore has its own property:
* Redstone ore - Gives the player absorption hearts
* Diamond ore - Drops a diamond sword or diamon armor
* Emerald ore - Drops enchanted items
* Iron ore - Drops andesite blocks and arrows
* Gold ore - Drops miscellaneous like golden apples, cobwebs, and andesite blocks

==== Hide and Seek ====
Hide and Seek is a 16-player based mode with two teams: the seeker and the hiders. Initially,  15 hiders are disguised as regular Minecraft [[block]]s depending on each map. The seeker is released 30 seconds into the game and are equipped with an [[iron sword]]. If a hider is [[Health#Death|found]], they respawn as a seeker. The game finishes when all hiders are found concluding in the seekers' victory or when the 5 minute timer finishes, concluding in the hiders' victory.

==== Just Build ====
Just Build is a take on Build Battle where players can create according to a theme in a bounding box. 
==== Parkour ====
Not to be confused with the hub parkour, this minigame is a take on DeathRun where players have to reach the end whilst being chased by hunters.

=== Hospital Replica ===
Using Minigame Browser or by the {{cmd|tp}} command, players are able to explore a replica of the hospital created by [https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/henry-c-ou/ Henry C. Ou].

=== Survival World ===
Players can teleport to the same world in the same instance, similar to a [[realm]], with [[Commands/op|operator]] status, allowing them to switch into [[creative mode]]. Changes in these worlds are permanent.
