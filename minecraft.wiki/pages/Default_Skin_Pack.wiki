'''Default Skin Pack''' (called '''Standard Skin Pack''' in {{editions|3ds}}) is a [[skin pack]] consisting of 2 skins, included by default in {{editions|education|3ds}}. Unless the player manually selects a skin from another skin pack, a skin from this pack is automatically applied to them.

Before being replaced by the [[Character Creator]], this skin pack was also present in {{BE}} and additionally included the option to select an image file as a custom skin.
