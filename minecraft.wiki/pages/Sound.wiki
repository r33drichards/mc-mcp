{{See also|Tutorial:Sound directory}}
'''Sounds''' are auditory outputs of the game intended to communicate the happening of certain events, as well as create atmosphere. Different objects such as [[mob]]s, [[weapon]]s or [[block]]s have sounds.

== Gameplay ==
{{IN|java}}, up to 255 sounds can be played at once but general sounds can take only 247 slots, with mood sounds taking the remaining 8 slots. {{IN|bedrock}}, up to 32 sounds can be played at the same time.<ref>[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/introductiontosound Introduction to Sounds | Microsoft Learn]</ref>

Most sounds can be heard from up to 16 blocks away, with the exception of:
* {{BlockLink|Note Block|Note Blocks}}, which can be heard up to 48 blocks away.
* {{BlockLink|Jukebox|Jukeboxes}}, which can be heard up to 64 blocks away.
* [[Goat Horn|Goat Horns]], which can be heard up to 256 blocks away, subject to server view distance.
* Global sound events, which is played for every player at the same volume, regardless of distance. These include:
** When an [[end portal]] opens
** When the [[ender dragon]] dies
** When a [[wither]] finishes charging up<ref>{{bug|MC-177741||Wither spawning sounds play for all players}}</ref>
** When a [[guardian]] uses its laser attack{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MC-57057||Guardian laser attack sound ignores distance}}</ref>
{{IN|java}}, these global sound events can be disabled by setting the [[game rule]] {{cd|globalSoundEvents}} to {{cd|false}}.

=== Mood ===
{{Main|Ambience}}
Mood is a special group of sounds that play after an internal counter reaches 100%, visible on the [[debug screen]], activating only when the player is in [[light level]] 0.

=== Commands ===
Sounds can be played and stopped with the {{cmd|playsound}} and {{cmd|stopsound}} [[commands]].

{{Notelist}}

=== Entity-dependent categories ===
Some sounds choose their category based on the entity that performs the action. For example, if a [[vindicator]] steps on a block, the step sound is in the Hostile Creatures category, but if a [[player]] steps on a block, the step is in the Players category.

== Accessibility ==
{{See also|Narrator}}

=== Subtitles ===
{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}
{{in development|bedrock||26.0|section=1}}
{{Main|Subtitles}}
Subtitles display text for in-game sounds in the bottom-right corner of the screen. They also add arrows next to the sounds that show the general direction that the sound came from. They allow deaf people to not be at an extreme disadvantage, as well as to aid other players in knowing where sounds came from. Subtitles can be toggled in the Music & Sounds and Accessibility Settings [[option]] menus.

== Data values ==
{{Main|Sound events}}
All sound events have names, such as <code>block.stone.hit</code> {{only|java}} or <code>step.stone</code> {{only|bedrock}}.

== Videos ==

== History ==
{{See also|Java Edition history of sound events|Bedrock Edition history of sound events}}
Due to a change in how ''Minecraft'' downloads its resources, [[Alpha v1.1.2_01]] is the oldest version in which sounds work using the modern ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''.
