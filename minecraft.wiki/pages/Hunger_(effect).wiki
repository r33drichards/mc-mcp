'''Hunger''' is a [[status effect]] which causes the [[hunger]] bar to deplete faster than normal.

== Effect ==
Hunger increases [[food]] exhaustion by 0.005 × level per game [[tick]] (removes {{hunger|1}} saturation point every (40 ÷ level) seconds). It also turns the hunger bar a yellow-green color({{hungerbar|2|9px|poisoned=1}}). Negative levels decrease food exhaustion, although they do not increase saturation or the hunger bar.

The status effect does not decrease hunger level on [[Peaceful]], although it does re-color the hunger bar.

[[File:Eating Rotten Flesh.png|thumb|right|An example of how eating rotten flesh can cause the hunger status effect.]]
Hunger inflicted by eating [[rotten flesh]], [[raw chicken]] or by being attacked by a [[husk]] adds 3.0 to the player's exhaustion level over the course of 30 seconds, draining {{frac|3|4}} of a saturation point. When a [[Pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]] is eaten, 4.5 exhaustion points are added over the course of 15 seconds, draining {{hunger|1}} and {{frac|1|8}} (0.125) saturation points.
