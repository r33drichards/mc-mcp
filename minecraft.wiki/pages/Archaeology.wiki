'''Archaeology''' is a gameplay mechanic that allows the [[player]] to find [[item]]s that represent historical artifacts inside [[suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]].

== Guide ==
Players can use a [[brush]] on suspicious sand (located in warm [[ocean ruins]], [[desert pyramid]]s, and [[desert well]]s) or suspicious gravel (located in cold ocean ruins and [[trail ruins]]). Players can discover and obtain artifacts and other [[loot table|loot]], such as [[stick]]s, [[emerald]]s, and [[pottery sherd]]s, which can be used to craft [[decorated pot]]s. If a suspicious block falls or is broken, the loot inside is lost.

== Features ==
=== Blocks ===
; {{InvLink|Decorated Pot|scale=1}}
* Can be crafted with any 4 pottery sherds or [[brick]] items, placed in a rhombus shape.
** The specific type of crafting material used determines which side of the resulting decorated pot shows a symbol.
*** The possible symbols are determined by the type of pottery sherd used to craft the pot.
*** Sides of the pot corresponding to bricks when crafted use a plain texture with no symbol.
* Fragile and easy to break:
** If broken with any block-breaking tool, drops as its component materials.
** If broken without a tool, or using a tool with the [[Silk Touch]] [[Enchanting|enchantment]], drops as itself.
** Can be broken with projectiles.
* Has a single storage slot that allows players to store up to one stack of a block or item.

; [[File:Sniffer Egg.png|x32px|link=Sniffer Egg]] {{InvLink|Sniffer Egg|scale=1}}
* Only found from suspicious sand in warm [[ocean ruins]].
* Hatches into [[snifflet]]s.
* Once two eggs are found, can be continuously obtained by [[breeding]] sniffers with [[torchflower seeds]].

; {{InvLink|Suspicious Gravel|scale=1}}
* Generates in cold ocean ruins and [[trail ruins]].
* Brushing the suspicious gravel with a brush extracts items.
* Suspicious gravel drops as an item in Survival mode if it stays in its falling block entity state for more than 30 seconds. This can be achieved by dropping the suspicious gravel into a two-block deep soul sand bubble column or onto two layers of cobwebs. Both actions slow down the falling suspicious gravel enough for its 30-second timer to expire, allowing it to drop in item form.{{only|Java}}

; {{InvLink|Suspicious Sand|scale=1}}
* Generates in [[desert pyramid]]s, [[desert well]]s, and warm ocean ruins.
* Brushing the suspicious sand with a brush extracts items.
* Suspicious sand drops as an item in Survival mode if it stays in its falling block entity state for more than 30 seconds. This can be achieved by dropping the suspicious sand into a two-block deep soul sand bubble column or onto two layers of cobwebs. Both actions slow down the falling suspicious sand enough for its 30-second timer to expire, allowing it to drop in item form.{{only|Java}}

=== Items ===
; {{InvLink|Brush|scale=1}}
* Tools which can be used to brush suspicious blocks.
* Can be crafted with a [[feather]], [[copper ingot]], and [[stick]].

* They cannot be [[Crafting|craft]]ed and are only found by [[brush]]ing [[suspicious sand]] and [[suspicious gravel]].

; {{InvLink|Music Disc Relic|text=Relic Music Disc|scale=1}}

=== World generation ===
; {{EnvLink|Trail Ruins}}
* A buried [[Structure|generated structure]] from a lost culture.
* Generates in [[taiga]]s, [[snowy taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s (both types), [[old growth birch forest]]s, and [[jungle]]s.
* Comprised of a tower, a path across the bottom, and a few additional rooms attached to the side.
* Contains [[gravel]] and suspicious gravel, as well as [[mud bricks]] and several colors of [[terracotta]] and [[glazed terracotta]].
* Four armor trims and seven pottery sherds can be found here.
