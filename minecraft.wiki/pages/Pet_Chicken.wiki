The '''pet chicken''' is a pet variant of the [[chicken]] introduced in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Spawning ==
A pet chicken spawns next to the player on [[Mine (dimension)|mine]] start when the "Pet Chicken" [[Player Unlock]] is active.

== Drops ==
This chicken can lay regular eggs, and so can be used to introduce chickens into a mine that don't have any.

== Behavior ==
The pet chicken is similar to the regular [[chicken]], but there are still some differences:
*The [[player]]'s [[melee attack]] can't damage the pet chicken.
*The pet chicken can't be attracted by {{control|using}} certain [[item]]s (such as [[wheat seeds]]), and can't be [[fed]].
*The pet chicken can die by [[falling]], although it can slow down itself when [[Entity#Motion|falling]].
