== Biography ==
The Harpy appeared in Episode 4 of Season 2 of the [[Minecraft Mini-Series]], when [[Quinn]] and [[Zed]] went to the cave to get the enchanted eye of Ender. They were met by Arachne in the cave, but when the heroes approached the Harpy's cave, the Arachne convinced them of fear. When they entered the cave, the Harpy attacked them, and when the heroes were almost killed, [[CommuniKate]] and [[Durango]] came and caught and held the harpy on a fishing rod. Then the heroes took the eye and leaved the cave.

== Power and Abilities ==
