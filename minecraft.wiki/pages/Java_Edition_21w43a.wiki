'''21w43a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on October 27, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w43a|October 27, 2021}}</ref> which adds the old world upgrading and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
[[File:Biome Blending.jpg|thumb|360px|Biome blending in action.]]
=== World generation ===
'''Upgrading of old worlds'''
* Terrain from new chunks now blends with existing terrain from old chunks, preventing glitched borders from occurring.
* The old [[bedrock]] layer between Y=0 and Y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with [[deepslate]].
* If there is bedrock at Y=0, lower places in old chunks are filled with deepslate.
** Caves do not generate below Y=0 in old chunks but lava lakes and [[geode]]s may generate.
* A new bedrock layer is placed at Y=-64.
* Worlds upgraded in this snapshot have these changes permanently applied.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added block tag <code>big_dripleaf_placeable</code>.
** Contains [[farmland]] and the [[Tag#blocks dirt|#dirt]] and [[Tag#blocks small dripleaf placeable|#small dripleaf placeable]] block tags.
** [[Big dripleaf]] can be placed on blocks in this tag.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Big Dripleaf JE3.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Big dripleaf|Big Dripleaf]]'''
* Restricted big dripleaf placement to [[clay]], [[coarse dirt]], [[dirt]], [[farmland]], [[grass block]]s, [[moss block]]s, [[mycelium]], [[podzol]], and [[rooted dirt]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Aquifer]]s'''
* [[Water]] levels change less often (slightly fewer underground waterfalls).
* [[Lava]] aquifers are slightly less common.

'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Reduced the amount of flooded caves near [[river]] and [[ocean]] coastlines.

'''[[Ocean]]'''
* Removed [[deep warm ocean]] biomes.
** [[Warm ocean]] biomes now generate in deep waters.

'''[[Seed (world generation)|Seeds]]'''
* Have been reshuffled again. Worlds don't look like as they did in previous snapshots.<ref>{{tweet|henrikkniberg|1453406170157359109|Unfortunately the seeds have been shuffled again, so worlds will not look like they did in previous snapshots. Hopefully world seeds will be stable after this though, so let the real seed hunt begin!|October 27, 2021}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Chunk format]]'''
* Removed chunk’s <code>Level</code> and moved everything it contained up.
** <code>Level.Entities</code> has moved to <code>entities</code>.
** <code>Level.TileEntities</code> has moved to <code>block_entities</code>.
** <code>Level.TileTicks</code> and <code>Level.ToBeTicked</code> have moved to <code>block_ticks</code>.
** <code>Level.LiquidTicks</code> and <code>Level.LiquidsToBeTicked</code> have moved to <code>fluid_ticks</code>.
** <code>Level.Sections</code> has moved to <code>sections</code>.
** <code>Level.Structures</code> has moved to <code>structures</code>.
** <code>Level.Structures.Starts</code> has moved to <code>structures.starts</code>.
** <code>Level.Sections[].block_states</code> has moved to <code>sections[].block_states</code>.
** <code>Level.Sections[].biomes</code> has moved to <code>sections[].biomes</code>.
* Added <code>yPos</code> the minimum section y position in the chunk.
* Added <code>below_zero_retrogen</code> containing data to support below zero generation.
* Added <code>blending_data</code> containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks.

'''[[Options]]'''
* The Priority Updates video setting has been renamed to Chunk Builder, added tooltips to its three options, and renamed them:
** "nearby" renamed to "Fully Blocking".
** "by player" renamed to "Semi Blocking".
** "none" renamed to "Threaded".

'''[[Tick]]'''
* Changed some internal details of block and fluid ticking to improve save times.
