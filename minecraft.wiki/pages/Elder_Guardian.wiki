An '''elder guardian''' is a large [[hostile mob]] and a variant of the [[guardian]]. It is the largest and strongest [[aquatic]] mob. It attacks the same way as a normal guardian, and it also applies [[Mining Fatigue]] to [[player]]s in a large radius around itself. They are only found in [[ocean monument]]s; three of them generate in each one.

== Spawning ==
Three elder guardians spawn naturally during the generation of each [[ocean monument]]:
* One in the top room of the monument.
* One in each of the two wings of the monument.

They are spawned ''with'' the ocean monument and thus they do not respawn.

== Drops ==
{{bug|MCPE-57215}} causes the elder guardian not to drop random fish {{in|bedrock}}.

[[File:Guardian laser.png|thumb|Laser]]

== Behavior ==
Elder guardians do not swim around as much as normal guardians, and they do not swim away when approached by a player they are targeting, unlike regular guardians. Like normal guardians, elder guardians attempt to attack the player, [[squid]], [[glow squid]], and [[Axolotl|axolotls]].

The elder guardian's eye follows and stares at any nearby players and always looks directly at its target. The eye still follows a player under the effects of [[Invisibility]] or in [[Spectator]] mode, though the elder guardian does not attack.

Elder guardians are considered [[aquatic]] mobs, and thus are affected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment.{{only|java}}{{until|Java Combat Tests|nocat=1}}

The elder guardian has three methods of attacking, including firing its laser, inflicting [[Mining Fatigue]], and a defensive thorn-like attack. 

The elder guardian pathfinds toward an ocean monument if it is not within one. 

An elder guardian attacks [[axolotl]]s that are not playing dead. Otherwise, an elder guardian does not attack mobs that attack it, although the attacking mob takes damage from the elder guardian's natural spikes defense.

The elder guardian, like a normal guardian, does not take suffocation damage when out of the water for a prolonged period of time.

Elder guardians cannot ride [[Boat|boats]].[[File:ElderGuardianCurseJava.gif|alt=Clip of player in boat being cursed with mining fatigue by elder guardian in java.|thumb|Cursing player in Java Edition.]]
=== Laser ===
The laser takes several seconds to charge, doing no damage and allowing the player to move away in the meantime. As it charges, it changes from purple to bright yellow. Once charged, the beam flashes green, abruptly ends, and deals {{hp|12}} damage on Hard difficulty. The elder guardian swims around for a few seconds before firing again. The beam cannot be dodged and has a maximum range of approximately 14 blocks. Once the player is out of range, if the beam is obstructed by solid blocks, or if the player has a shield, the guardian's beam disengages from the player and deals no damage.

=== Inflicting Mining Fatigue ===
{{IN|java}}, immediately after spawning and once each minute thereafter, the elder guardian searches for any player within a spherical radius of 50 blocks to afflict with [[Mining Fatigue]] III. {{IN|bedrock}}, the elder guardian inflicts any unafflicted player within range immediately.

When afflicted, the player sees a ghostly image of the elder guardian and hears a ghostly noise. The effect decreases a player's attack speed by 30% and decreases mining speed even more for 5 minutes. The attack targets players through blocks, even underground, and a potion of [[Invisibility]] offers no defense. This is not considered an attack in regards to the [[Thorns]] enchantment.[[File:ElderGuardianCurseBedrock.gif|alt=Clip of player in boat being cursed with mining fatigue by elder guardian in bedrock.|thumb|Cursing player in Bedrock Edition.]]

The image of the elder guardian is a particle effect that can be recreated by issuing the command {{cmd|particle minecraft:elder_guardian}}.{{only|java}}
=== Spikes defense ===
An elder guardian deals {{hp|2}} ({{hp|3}} on Hard mode) damage every time it is hit while its spikes are extended, similar to the [[Thorns]] enchantment on armor. If cornered by a player or axolotl, the elder guardian usually extends its spikes and fires at point-blank range.

== Trivia ==
* The elder guardian's status as a boss or simply a powerful mob was historically ambiguous. While it lacks important characteristics of a boss, chiefly a health bar, it has been grouped with boss mobs and addressed as one by Mojang before.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1248264777924775938|What do you think are the greatest weaknesses and strengths of Minecraft's bosses from a design perspective?|April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{mcnet|meet-elder-guardian|Meet the Elder Guardian|November 6, 2017|Emily Richardson}}</ref> The elder guardian was also marketed as a boss {{in|pe}}, having been introduced in the [[Boss Update]]. Jeb later stated that it is intended as a miniboss rather than a full boss and that this is why it does not have a health bar.<ref name="miniboss">{{ytl|gs-rMm5luB8|Why are their eyes so big? <nowiki>|</nowiki> The Story Of The Elder Guardian|Minecraft|August 24, 2025|t=278s}}</ref>
* The elder guardian's eye is the "head" part of the [[mob]]'s [[model]], giving the illusion of a dynamic eye.
* According to [[Jeb]], elder guardians were introduced to encourage [[player]]s to solve the temple maze rather than dig through it easily. He acknowledges there are ways around it, but players still have to solve the challenge in a different way.<ref name=":0" />
** Also according to Jeb, the "jumpscare" by an elder guardian is unintentional; instead, he added it to provide a visual cue as to why players get slowed down by [[Mining Fatigue]].<ref name=":0" />
* {{IN|bedrock}}, elder guardians make their underwater death sounds if killed on land.
* According to a post Jeb made on Bluesky, the elder guardian drops a sponge to make sure a player can get at least three from an ocean monument without a sponge room.<ref>{{bluesky|camcamburger.bsky.social|3lqxwreiins25|@jebox.bsky.social hello, was the sponge drop from elder guardians meant to be a placeholder? a few famous people have been saying so but i couldn't find a source for it. keep up the good work, loved your cameo!|June 6, 2025}}<br>{{bluesky|jebox.bsky.social|3lrb26wj5fc2w|No?

* Despite being classified as only a [[monster]], the elder guardian was referred to as an "[[animal]] of the deep" in a ''Minecraft'' video about them.<ref>{{ytl|gs-rMm5luB8|Why are their eyes so big? <nowiki>|</nowiki> The Story Of The Elder Guardian|Minecraft|August 24, 2025|t=56s}}</ref>
