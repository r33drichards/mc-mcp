This page lists generated '''terrain features''' that are created as part of the [[world generation]].

== Overworld ==
=== Hill ===
{{for|the biome|Windswept Hills}}

Hills can contain extreme slopes, cliffs, and [[cave]]s. On an [[amplified]] world, hills are extremely common in all biomes except [[ocean]]s.

=== Mountain ===
{{for|the biome|Mountains}}
Mountains are high elevation terrain that has jagged peaks and higher land.

=== Cliff ===
Cliffs are steep vertical slopes that can sometimes generate beside an ocean or a big lake.

=== Fjord ===
{{Redirect|Fjord|the mission in minecraft dungeons|Dungeons:Frosted Fjord}}
Fjords happen when rivers cut through high-medium elevation terrain. Rivers are deeper here than usual.

=== Floating island ===
Floating islands are structures that float in mid-air. Floating islands are normally just small chunks of floating [[dirt]] and [[stone]] found near cliffs, but on rare occasions they can be large structures that even have springs and [[tree]]s on them. Floating islands are most frequently found in [[windswept hills]] biomes and their variants, as well as [[windswept savanna]]s.

=== Noise cave ===
{{main|Cave#Noise_caves}}

Noise caves are generated using a noise. They come in the form of cheese caves, spaghetti caves, and noodle caves. By adjusting noise frequency, hollowness (for cheese caves), and thickness (for spaghetti caves, noodle caves, and noise pillars), noise caves can vary in extremely diverse ways. When generating noise caves, the game firstly generates a random noise field, and "smudges" it using a mathematical trick called Perlin noise. These processes then result in a 3D noise image. Noise pillars also generate inside cave blobs.

Noise caves are a part of the base terrain generation, and so do not intersect generated structures or mineral deposits. They are typically decorated with biome-specific features and decoration such as grass, sand, snow, or trees at higher y-levels, or dripstone pillars or clay deltas at lower y-levels. This is important, as cave noise is dually used to generate important Overworld terrain features such as overhangs or floating islands on the surface.

=== Surface ===
<!-- Not exactly a 'surface' feature, but bedrock is added here-->

==== Surface layer ====
The uppermost layers of the terrain are converted to a biome-dependent material: usually grass blocks and dirt, or sand in deserts and beaches. Podzol is found in giant tree taiga, mycelium in mushroom field biomes, and red sand is found in the badlands biome. Sandstone is generated under the sand.

==== Erosion ====
{{main|Erosion}}
In older versions of Minecraft, instead of being converted to dirt or sand, the top layer is stripped away, leaving an 'erosion' (aka. 'basin') of bare [[stone]]. Commonly, minerals can be found in these, generally [[coal ore]] and [[iron ore]]. If generated in a Badlands biome, [[gold ore]] can also be seen. Erosions appear in all dimensions. Due to a bug, this no longer occurs except in frozen oceans.

==== Strip ====
{{redirect|Strip|the mechanic used by [[axe]]s|Axe#Stripping and scraping}}
Strips are long stretches of blocks in certain biomes that replace the typical surface materials in these biomes. They can occur in [[stony shore]] biomes as strips of [[gravel]], in [[stony peaks]] biomes as strips of [[calcite]], in [[frozen peaks]] biomes as strips of [[packed ice]], as well as in [[grove]] and [[snowy slopes]] biomes as strips of [[powder snow]].

==== Hoodoo ====
Hoodoos are tall spike-like structures found in badlands, consisting of six colors of terracotta. While this structure is found exclusively in [[eroded badlands]], all badlands biomes actually have this structure, but set to false except for eroded badlands and can occasionally pass altitude layer 100.

==== Iceberg ====
{{about|a terrain feature known as iceberg|a feature called iceberg|Iceberg (feature)}}
A '''large iceberg''' is a large terrain feature composed of [[packed ice]] and [[snow block]]s. There is also a smaller feature known as a [[Iceberg (feature)|cone iceberg]].

Large icebergs generate in [[frozen ocean]]s and [[deep frozen ocean]]s. They consist of [[packed ice]], and can be topped with snow blocks. Icebergs generate in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from small islands to giant mountain-like icebergs. They can also generate with cave-like holes (these might be related to the [[Iceberg (feature)#Carved|carved recesses]] in cone icebergs) {{Info needed}} in them, which sometimes pass through to the other side of the iceberg.

There are often [[Iceberg (feature)#Blue ice feature|blue ice feature]]s attached to them.

=== Carvers ===
* [[Carver cave]]s – narrow, winding tunnels found underground in the Overworld and the Nether.
* [[Canyon]]s – deep fissures that run through the ground.

=== Others ===
* [[Ore vein]] – a large, branching network of [[ore]] and [[rock]].

== The Nether ==
=== Lava sea ===
Lava seas are found at and below [[altitude|y-level 31]] in the Nether. They make a large portion of the Nether and are extremely common. They can stretch for hundreds of blocks in any direction, and are usually bordered by [[netherrack]], or occasionally [[soul sand]], [[gravel]], and/or [[magma block]]s. [[Strider]]s can spawn in lava seas.

Unlike with [[Overworld]] oceans, lava seas are not handled as a biome.<ref>{{bug|MC-177716||Lava oceans in the Nether are not handled as a biome, unlike with the Overworld|Invalid}}</ref>

=== Nether erosions ===
{{main|Erosion#The Nether}}
In the Nether, erosions generate the same size and shape as they do in the Overworld. Unlike their Overworld counterparts, however, Nether erosions replace the ground with [[netherrack]] instead of stone. Nether erosions can also expose ores, mainly [[Nether quartz ore]] and [[Nether gold ore]].

Notably, erosions generate independent of the y-coordinate; if an erosion generates in an overhang in the Nether, an identical erosion is guaranteed to generate at the exact same x and z coordinates on the ground below such an overhang.

== The End ==
=== Central island ===
The center of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely of [[End stone]], floating in the void. It features the [[exit portal]] in the center, surrounded by 10 [[End spike]]s in a circle. The island is home to the [[ender dragon]], and serves as the arena where it is fought.

At a distance of 1000 blocks away, an endless expanse of additional islands begins, away from the main island. These consist of large islands, about the size of the main island, and smaller ones, which are usually thin and small.

=== Outer islands ===
The outer End islands are found 1000 blocks away from the central island. They vary in size from large islands to smaller "mini islands". Generated structures such as [[End City|End cities]] and [[End City#End ship|End ship]]s spawn here, along with [[chorus tree]]s and erosions. The player can be taken to the End islands through the [[End gateway]].

=== Obsidian platform ===
{{main|Obsidian platform}}
The obsidian platform is a square of obsidian that generates when an entity enters [[the End]].

=== End erosions ===
{{main|Erosion#The End}}
Erosions generate in the End as they would in the Overworld and the Nether but they never expose any ores. End erosions may generate on both the central island and outer islands, and [[chorus tree]]s can occasionally take root in the erosions.
