'''Beta 1.6.5''' is a version of [[Java Edition Beta]] released on May 28, 2011,<ref>{{twon|5938461844|Minecraft Beta 1.6.5|May 28, 2011}}</ref> which contains minor changes and fixes some of the bugs and crashes in [[Beta 1.6.4]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Cobblestone Slab JE1 BE1.png; Oak Slab JE1 BE1.png; Sandstone Slab JE1 BE1.png; Smooth Stone Slab JE1 BE1.png; Seamless Stone Slab JE1.png|32px}} [[Slab]]s'''
* It is now possible to climb the blocks while [[sneaking]].

'''{{Animate|Cobblestone Stairs (N) JE1 BE1.png; Oak Stairs (N) JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Stairs]]'''
* It is now possible to climb the blocks while [[sneaking]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Riding]]'''
* Players who are riding anything stop doing so when they leave the game.

'''[[Sleeping]]'''
* Players who are sleeping stop doing so when they leave the game.

'''[[Sneaking]]'''
* Effect has been decreased.
** The player's feet look like they're in the air.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Control]]s'''
* {{key|Shift}} + clicking the [[crafting]] output only performs a single crafting action, instead of the maximum possible amount.
** For instance, {{key|Shift}} + clicking while crafting [[torches]] only transfers 4 torches into the [[inventory]] at a time.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Advanced OpenGL re-added.
* Cap can now be changed, with toggles of 40 FPS, 90 FPS, and 200 FPS. 
** Except for the 40 FPS setting, the framerate is only capped when there are any chunk updates.<ref>[[wordofnotch:5945205026|What the framerate limiter does]] – The Word of Notch, May 29, 2011</ref>

'''Version number'''
* No longer displayed while playing unless the "unlicensed copy" message is being shown.
* Still visible on title screen and debug screen.

== Fixes ==
'''13 bugs fixed'''
* Player indicator on [[map]]s now points in the same direction as the player, instead of being rotated slightly.
* Dropped equipment no longer breaks on the first use (in some cases it still does).
* Objects are now pushed out if they are within a block.
* Lighting acts normal again when placing/removing [[torch]]es.
* The game no longer crashes when shift-clicking to put items in a chest that is already full and vice versa.
* Fixed CPU issue on [[multiplayer]].
* Saving while crouching no longer consistently teleports the player into blocks above or below when loading the save.
* Exiting a [[minecart]] or moving from one minecart to another no longer bumps the original minecart and makes it move.
* Fixed the players [[health]] appearing to be full when entering/exiting [[the Nether]].
* Fixed some entities appearing to fall through the ground repeatedly in multiplayer (some might still do so).
* Fixed the server sometimes thinking the player hit a corner when walking when they didn't.
* Fixed the achievements window rendering some graphics outside the clip window.
* Fixed a couple of instances where [[bed]]s would act strange in multiplayer, primarily the "already occupied" bug.</onlyinclude>
