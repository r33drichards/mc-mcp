The suitable tool to break stone bricks is [[pickaxe]]. Stone bricks needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.

Regular stone bricks generate as part of [[stronghold]]s, making up most of the walls, ceilings, and floors. They can also generate as part of cold [[ocean ruins]] and [[ruined portal]]s. [[Igloo]] basements are lined with stone bricks. Stone bricks can also spawn in [[trail ruins]], and in [[trial chambers]] surrounding [[silverfish]] [[trial spawners]]. A single stone brick can generate in snowy [[village]]s under one of the possible meeting points (<code>snowy_meeting_point_2</code>).

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|stone-bricks}}
