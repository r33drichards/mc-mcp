== Nutrition information ==
All nutrition information is available publicly from [https://smartlabel.kelloggs.com/Product/Index/00038000217203 SmartLabel] and is based off of a 2,000-calorie diet.

== Character creator items ==
The following [[character creator]] items, all of rare rarity, have been available from the cereal:
{{:Character Creator/Minecraft_Creeper_Crunch}}

== Issues ==
The Kellogg's™ - Minecraft In Game Content Offer Terms and Conditions have not been updated on the number of items available by the codes.

This mention does not prevent the legality of the terms and conditions but can create confusion, despite the sale of the boxes and the large number of sources on the internet proving very different versions of the creeper crunch as well as the number of items actually available.

== Trivia ==
* Originally, only ten character creation items were available through this method, three more items were later added, then three more, then three more again, then three more once more.
* Originally, this cereal was planned to be discontinued on August 31, 2021, but was pushed back to June 30, 2022 for unknown reasons.
