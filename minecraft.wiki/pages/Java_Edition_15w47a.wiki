== Trivia ==
* 15w47a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* This snapshot was released exactly 4 years after the full release of {{JE}}.
** It has since remained the most recent version of {{JE}} to be released on the exact anniversary of the game's full release.
