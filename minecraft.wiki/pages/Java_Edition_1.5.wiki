'''[[File:Daylight Detector JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Daylight Sensor]]'''
*Outputs a signal with a strength corresponding to the intensity of the [[sun]].
*Only works with the sun's light (not man-made light such as torches).
*Rain affects the sensor's output.

*Places items in containers in front of them, if there is no container it dispenses the item without using it.
*A [[dispenser]] "shoots" [[item]]s at the [[player]], while a [[dropper]] "throws" items at the player.<ref>{{tweet|dinner|291942193969639425}}</ref>
*Can face all 6 directions, with a different texture when facing up or down.
*Needs redstone signal to drop items.
*Fires once when the input becomes powered.
*Redstone signal emitted when a [[redstone comparator]] is placed against it directly - signal length depends on its fullness.

'''[[File:Hopper (item) JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Hopper]]'''
*Places and takes out items in [[hopper]]s, [[chest]]s, [[furnace]]s, [[minecart with chest]]s, [[minecart with hopper]]s, [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, and [[brewing stand]]s.
*Allows for the automation of many processes collecting drops.
*Powering the [[hopper]] stops it from taking in items and releasing them.
*Redstone signal emitted when a [[redstone comparator]] is placed against it directly - signal length depends on its fullness.
**1 item gives a signal strength of 1, a third of a stack (21 for items which stack to 64) gives a signal strength of 2.
**The number of full stacks × 3 = Signal strength.

'''[[File:Redstone Comparator (item) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Redstone Comparator]]'''
*Based on the idea of the capacitor mentioned at Minecon 2012.
*It is the same as a repeater, but with 2 inputs.
**If input A is stronger or equal to input B, it either repeats the signal or outputs the difference between A and B, so this can be used as an easier way make redstone contraptions like piston doors.
***Output is toggleable by right-clicking.
**If input A is weaker than input B, then there is no output.
*All containers output a redstone signal when a redstone comparator is placed against it directly. The strength of it depends on how full the container is and what disc number is used in a [[jukebox]].
**This works with trapped chests as well, meaning it can provide two redstone signals with different causes at the same time.

'''[[File:Trapped Chest (S) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Trapped Chest]]'''
*Gives out a signal depending on the amount of players looking inside.
*Large trapped chests can be staggered with large chests to allow more compact storage.
*Transmit signal downward through one block. This does not apply horizontally.<ref>{{tweet|dinner|289738233984741378}}</ref>
*Texture is slightly different than a normal chest, with a red stain around the latch.
{{Crafting Table
|A1=Chest
|B1=Tripwire Hook
|Output=Trapped Chest
}}

'''{{Animate|Light Weighted Pressure Plate JE3 BE2.png;Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate JE2 BE2.png|32px}} Weighted Pressure Plates'''
*Used to detect [[item]] drops.
*Gold ([[Light Weighted Pressure Plate|light]]) version reaches full strength at 60 items.
*Iron ([[Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate|heavy]]) version reaches full strength at 600 items.
*Proportional, so 10 strength signal means twice as many items as a 5 strength signal.

*Fully implemented - previously, a world editor could be used for different heights of snow.
*Drops one [[snowball]] for every layer of snow.
*Each level of snow has its own height collision.
**The topmost layer of snow does not have collision, so the player is always slightly sunken in the snow.
**Visually, four layers of snow are the same height as a slab. However, five layers of snow have the same collision height as a slab.
**For each thin layer of snow crafted, the player loses exactly half the snowballs required to produce it.
