== Video ==
{{Main|Minecraft 1.2 Trailer}}
Similar to [[Java Edition 1.1]], an official video documenting some of the 1.2's major features was released on Mojang's official [[YouTube]] channel on March 1, 2012. The video was made by [[Hat Films]], who have made update trailers and videos for Mojang in the past.

== Trivia ==
* Development versions for 1.2 started only a week after [[Java Edition 1.1|1.1]] was released.
* Despite the number, 1.2.1 is the first full release, not a minor update.
* 1.2.1 has the same amount of snapshots as [[Java Edition 1.7.4|1.7.4]].
