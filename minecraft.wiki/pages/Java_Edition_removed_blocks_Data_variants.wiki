=== Incorrect blocks in flower pots ===
From [[Java Edition 1.7|1.7]] onward, as the amount of [[blocks]] that could be placed within [[flower pots]] exceeded 15, conventional 4-bit metadata values could not be used to store the contents of the flower pot, and as such a [[block entity]] needed to be used instead. This allowed any block (or indeed [[item]]) to be placed within a flower pot, but few of these would actually [[Rendering|render]] with the block inside.

In [[14w17a]], almost certainly due to changes in how blocks render with them being changed to use [[block models]] rather than hardcoded models, these odd pot variants simply rendered as empty pots with no further interesting quirks, aside from the fact that their "invalid" contents could be retrieved from the pot via [[breaking]] or later right clicking it. They were completely removed in [[17w47a]], which split the flower pot block up into an individual block ID per potted object and scrapped the tile entity.

==== 13w37a ====
The first version to make flower pots use a block entity, the fact that flower pots could hold [[ferns]] bled over somewhat into its other damage values, allowing [[shrubs]] and [[grass]] to exist in pots as well. Also, [[cobwebs]] would render if placed in a flower pot.

In order to be affected by [[Color#Biome colors|biome coloration]], potted ferns/grass/green shrubs needed to have a data value of 11 (the data value formerly belonging to the potted fern) – otherwise they would appear as their raw textures.

==== 14w06a ====
In this version, a large amount of blocks now render if placed in flower pots via [[commands]]. In order to place these with commands, use the following command, with ITEM and DATA substituted with the appropriate values from [[Java Edition data value/Pre-flattening/Block IDs]] as necessary:

{{cd|/setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:flower_pot 0 destroy {Item:ITEM,Data:DATA}<nowiki/>}}

Only blocks that are completely unique in their rendering are shown here; some visually identical blocks do exist that are not listed here separately, such as the early stages of both [[carrots]] and [[potatoes]], or potted [[pumpkins]] and [[jack o'lanterns]].

The blocks always appear as a cross shape based on their bottom [[Textures|texture]]. Blocks with [[translucency]] appear either completely opaque or, in the case of [[Stained Glass|stained glass]], most pixels are invisible.

Some blocks appear tinted by biome if their normal variants usually would be. Because [[leaves]] were tinted as per their numerical data values, setting the number prior to destroy to 1 for specifically potted leaves causes them to be tinted with the spruce color, and setting it to 2 gives the birch color. 0 or 3 results in them being tinted per biome like oak and jungle leaves are.
