''SpongeBob SquarePants'' is a multimedia franchise, primarily revolving around an animated comedy television series. The show centers around {{Wikipedia|SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants}}, an anthropomorphic sea sponge and his adventures working as a fry cook at the {{Wikipedia|Krusty Krab}}. Among the main cast are his best friend {{Wikipedia|Patrick Star}}, grumpy next door neighbor {{Wikipedia|Squidward Tentacles}}, a land squirrel scientist named {{Wikipedia|Sandy Cheeks}}, and his penny pinching boss {{Wikipedia|Mr. Krabs}}. The main antagonist of the series is {{Wikipedia|Plankton and Karen|Plankton}}, the former friend turned archenemy of Mr. Krabs, who aspires to steal his secret formula.

The series is among the most popular {{Wikipedia|Nicktoons}}, with SpongeBob being considered {{Wikipedia|Nickelodeon}}'s mascot and receiving more episodes than any other series. In 2004, the show would be adapted into a feature film, ''{{Wikipedia|The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie}}'', centered around SpongeBob and Patrick going on an odyssey to retrieve the crown of {{Wikipedia|Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune}}. In the years since its release, many other spin-offs and adaptations would follow, including ''{{Wikipedia|The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|The Patrick Star Show}}'' and ''{{Wikipedia|Kamp Koral}}''.
