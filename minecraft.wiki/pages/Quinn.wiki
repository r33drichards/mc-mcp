'''Quinn''' is a character in the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]'' and part of Team Stone Beach with [[Toby]]. She helps everyone to try and escape [[CommuniKate]]'s game show, winning a few minigames, and ultimately winning Season 1. She then teamed up with [[Durango]], [[CommuniKate]], and [[Zed]] in Season 2, ''The Greek Isles'' after [[Poseidon]] takes over.

== Appearance ==
Quinn has red hair in a ponytail, blue eyes, and tan skin. She wears a black jacket, a pink shirt with a white lighting bolt on it, light blue wristbands, dull tan pants, and brown shoes.

== Biography ==
Before the series began, Quinn was shown to be a stone beach crafter in between interview clips.

Quinn was once teleported from her home along with the others by [[CommuniKate]] using a [[command block]] on the show. She and [[Toby]] won some challenges, and in the final challenge, she met [[Mo]] and they, along with others, decided to sabotage. Their sabotage was successful, but, they were teleported to the [[Greek Isles]]. There, Quinn, along with [[Zed]], [[Durango]] and CommuniKate, were forced by [[Poseidon]] to bring him the enchanted eyes of Ender. After he got the eyes, the god decided to get rid of the heroes with a [[kraken]], but Quinn and the others escape and try to stop Poseidon, and soon [[Zeus]] comes, stops Poseidon and asks the heroes to help him. Apparently after helping Zeus, Quinn and Toby returned home.

== Personality ==
Quinn is independent and determined. She likes solitude and dislikes bossy, authoritative, or cocky people but learns to work with everyone throughout the show.

== Relationships ==
=== Toby ===
Despite the fact that Toby and Quinn represent the same biome, they have a rather weak relationship, at the level of communication.
=== CommuniKate ===
Quinn really hates CommuniKate and wants to stop her from deleteing players, but is forced to put work with her in order to save their friends in season 2.
=== Durango ===
Her and Durango started becoming rivals throughout the show but later on in Episode 7 they put their differences aside and became friends to defeat CommuniKate to go back home.
=== Mo ===
They've been friends since Episode 2, always helping each other out during challenges and eventually stopping CommunitKate's gameshow.
