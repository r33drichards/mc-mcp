A '''beetroot''' is a [[food]] and [[dye]] ingredient.

== Obtaining ==

=== Farming ===
Beetroots are obtained from harvesting a fully grown [[Beetroot Seeds|crop block]], which drops 1 beetroot and 1-4 seeds ({{frac|2|5|7}} seeds per plant harvested on average). Seed yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with [[Fortune]], with Fortune III harvesting an average of {{frac|5|3|7}} seeds per plant.

These crops can be found growing in [[village]]s or can be grown from planted [[beetroot seeds]].<!-- Do not add locations for finding seeds. Where to find seeds is described in the article about the seeds. -->

== Usage ==

=== Food ===
A beetroot can be eaten to restore {{hunger|1}} [[hunger]] and 1.2 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]]. Six beetroots can be crafted into [[beetroot soup]], which restores six times the hunger and saturation of a single beetroot.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== [[Breeding]] ===
Beetroots can be used to breed and attract [[pig]]s.

[[Villager]]s can pick up beetroot items to become willing, allowing them to [[Breeding|breed]]. Villagers need 12 beetroots before they can breed.

=== Composting ===
Placing a beetroot into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
