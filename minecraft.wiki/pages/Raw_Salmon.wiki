'''Raw salmon''' is a food item that can be eaten by the [[player]] or cooked to make [[cooked salmon]].

== Obtaining ==

{{LootChestItem|raw-salmon}}

=== Fishing ===
{{main|Fishing}}Raw salmon can be obtained from [[fishing]], with a 21.3% chance per attempt.

=== Smelting ingredient ===
{{smelting
 |Raw Salmon
 |Cooked Salmon
 |0.35
}}

=== Food ===
Raw salmon restores {{hunger|2}} [[hunger]] and 0.4 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

=== Cats ===
Raw salmon can be used to tame [[cat]]s with {{frac|1|3}} chance of success, get cats off of [[chest]]s, and [[bed]]s, [[breed]] cats, and make baby cats grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time. Additionally, raw salmon can be used to heal cats by {{hp|2|mob=1}}.

=== Ocelots ===
Raw salmon can be used to gain [[ocelot]] trust, breed ocelots, and make baby ocelots grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

=== Dolphins ===
A [[dolphin]] can be fed raw salmon to increase its trust of the player and cause it to interact with the player more often. However, unlike most other animal mobs, this does not cause them to breed. Additionally, raw salmon can be used to make baby dolphins grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

Dolphins swim to the nearest chest in a [[shipwreck]] or [[underwater ruin]] after they are fed raw salmon. If the chest in the nearest structure is broken, they swim to another structure with a chest.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Wolves ===
Raw salmon can be used to feed [[wolves]], healing them by {{hp|4|mob=1}}. However, {{in|Bedrock}}, unlike other wolf food, raw salmon cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves nor used to breed them and can only be fed to a wolf that is not at full health.
