=== General ===
* Attempted [[Wikipedia:LWJGL|LWJGL]] update.<ref>http://forum.lwjgl.org/index.php?topic=3189.msg17654#msg17654</ref>

== Trivia ==
* The [[al_version]] number of this version is 1.092, but number of [[Java Edition Indev 20100207-1101|previous version]] is 1.086. This possibly means that the five versions between these might be currently missing ones or [[Wikipedia:LWJGL|LWJGL]] updates.
