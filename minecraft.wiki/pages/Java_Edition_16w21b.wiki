'''16w21b''' is the third and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.10]], released on May 26, 2016,<ref name="16w21a-blog">https://web.archive.org/web/20160526231610/http://www.mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-snapshot-16w21a/</ref> which adds a few [[splash]]es, modifies the {{cmd|tp}} command, and fixes some bugs from [[16w21a]].

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added the following splashes:
** "Rule #1: it's never my fault".
** "Replaced molten cheese with blood?"
** "Absolutely fixed relatively broken coordinates".
** "Boats FTW".

== Changes ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|tp}} '''
* Relative coordinates are now relative to the executor of the command, not the teleported entity.
** {{cmd|execute}} can be used to get the old behavior.
* {{cmd|tp}} can now teleport the player to a Y-coordinate in the range -4096 to 4096 (increased from -512 to 512).

== Fixes ==

== Trivia ==
* 16w21b was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
*"Replaced molten cheese with blood?" is a technical reference to [[Java Edition 15w14a|15w14a]], which changed lava to "Molten Cheese"
