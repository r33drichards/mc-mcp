The '''savanna'''{{fn|Also known as '''savannah''' in [[Language#Differences between English variants|other English variants]].}} is an arid grassland [[biome]], featuring scattered [[acacia]] and [[oak]] trees. It is populated by warm [[animal]] variants, [[llama]]s, and [[armadillo]]s, and [[village]]s made of acacia wood are commonly found here.

== Description ==
Savannas typically generate bordering a [[desert]], [[forest]] or [[plains]] biome. [[Acacia]] and small [[oak tree]]s are the two types of trees that grow here; this is the only place where acacia trees naturally generate. As the savannas have arid climates, it never [[rain]]s here and thus [[lightning]] can never naturally strike; however, overcast skies (and daytime hostile [[mob]]s spawning in the case of [[thunderstorm]]s) still apply. [[Grass]] and [[leaves]] in the savanna take on an olive-green color, giving an impression of dryness.

The savanna is mostly flat with vast amounts of [[tall grass]] covering the surface. [[Village]]s generates in savannas, consisting mainly of terracotta, acacia [[logs]], and [[planks]]. [[Pillager outpost]]s may generate as well.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], savannas use warmish atmospherics, lighting, and color grading similar to [[jungles]], although they use default volumetric [[fog]].

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
