[[File:The Void Below.png|thumb|300px|The void as shown beneath the [[Overworld]].]]

The '''void''' is the space external to the area that can be used for building. In vanilla ''Minecraft'', it can be entered by using commands or map editors, in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode, using glitches, specific [[World seed|seed]]s, or by reaching [[the End]]. Blocks in the void cannot be changed, and any actions and events trying to generate [[block]]s, such as the generation of [[generated structure]]s and the use of the {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}} commands, cannot go beyond this restriction. However, opening a [[shulker box]] can make its [[hitbox]] expand into the void.

== Effects ==
=== Above the build limit ===
The void exists in the place higher than the buildable area, which is higher than 319 in the [[Overworld]], 127{{only|be}} or 255{{only|je}} in [[the Nether]], and 255 in [[the End]].

Usually, [[entities]] can't reach the void above Y=127 in the Nether because of the [[bedrock]] layer in this [[dimension]].

By continuously placing blocks when [[jumping]], the [[player]] will finally reach the void, and then become unable to be at a higher place. Therefore, it is easily reached by the player.

{{IN|je}}, [[wind charge]]s immediately [[explode]] when they are 30 blocks higher than the maximum buildable height.

=== Below the build limit ===
The void also exists below the buildable area, which is lower than -64 in the Overworld and 0 in the Nether and the End.

Usually, entities cannot reach the void below Y=-64 (Overworld) or Y=0 (Nether) because of the bedrock layers in these dimensions.

When entities fall in the void, they fall for 40 blocks {{in|be}} or infinitely {{in|je}}. Most of them do not have the ability to return to the buildable area, so the game directly removes them, or kills them by dealing [[damage]] to them.

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
Falling at least 64 blocks into the void (i.e. under Y=-128 in the [[Overworld]], or Y=-64 in [[the Nether]] and End) causes the health of any mob (except the [[ender dragon]]) to be depleted by about {{health|4}} every {{convert|10|tick|second}}, which is irrespective of any of the mob's protective effects ([[armor]], [[Protection]], [[Resistance]] and [[Player#Entity data|invulnerability]]). [[Totems of undying]] cannot be triggered when their owner dies from void damage.

This damage kills a player in {{frac|2|1|2}} seconds,  and death occurs depending on the player's velocity, usually being around 250 blocks into the void. Even if the player is in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator mode]], they will still die. Other [[status effect]]s can alter the death level slightly. A player who falls into the void on a server with anti-flying measures is kicked out regardless of having a flying mod. Riding a vehicle into the void results in the player being stuck in the vehicle until death. The void extends for 2{{^|1024}} blocks (1.797×10{{^|308}}) on the Y-axis.

[[File:WaterFlowingIntoVoid.png|thumb|200px|[[Liquid]]s, such as [[water]], cannot flow into the void.]]

In the Overworld, the void also appears as having daylight if the player views from above sea level (Y=63; feet level Y='''61.38'''). In [[the Nether]], similarly, the void appears as the same color with the biome fog, if the player views above lava sea level (Y=31; feet level Y='''29.38''').

Other [[entities]] may also fall through the void and receive the same damage as the player, with the exception of the [[wither]], which takes {{health|4}} every {{convert|1|tick|second}}. The [[ender dragon]] does not take void damage unless {{cmd|damage}} is used. Entities which are not [[Entity#Types of entities|living entities]] disappear at 64 blocks into the void. Any entity between 64 and 319 blocks into the void appears as black. In the Overworld and the Nether, the layer of [[bedrock]] at the bottom of the world prevents the player from accessing the void. In [[the End]], however, the void is easily accessible due to the large gaps between the islands.

In the Overworld, the void is black. In the Nether, the color of the void is dependent on the [[Biome#The Nether|biome]]. In the End, the void is dark purple. When viewed from the surface in the Overworld, it appears to be an inverted sky where the moon is visible during the day and the sun at night.

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' and ''Minecraft Education'' ====
[[File:Void Vibrant Visuals.png|thumb|The void with [[Vibrant Visuals]] has the interesting effect that light beams can fall through the bedrock at higher distances.]]
{{IN|bedrock|education}}, the mob's health is depleted by {{health|4}} every half second at Y=-82 (Overworld) /-18 (the Nether and the End) below, which is irrespective of any of the mob's protective effects ([[armor]], [[Protection]], [[Resistance]] and [[Player#Entity data|Invulnerability]]). [[Totems of undying]] can't be triggered when its owner dies from void damage.

At Y=-105/-41, there is a '''void floor''' made of [[invisible bedrock]], preventing [[entities]] from falling further. This barrier can be bypassed by using commands such as {{cmd|tp}}, after which the player falls infinitely. In Creative and Spectator mode, the player does not die, who is given free access to flying under the void. However, if the player goes to any coordinates beyond negative or positive X or Z of 8,388,608 blocks, the void floor effectively disappears because the [[chunk]]s there no longer contain solid blocks (see [[Bedrock Edition distance effects]] for more details). A similar phenomenon can also occur at certain lower coordinates in some instances.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-39299}}</ref>

The [[elytra]] also cannot be used below Y=-82/-18, unless it has been used for [[gliding]] when its owner goes below this altitude. It can be normally used in other areas.

All entities except [[camera]]s{{only|be}} and [[ender dragon]]s are damaged by the void in normal situations. The ender dragon does not take void damage unless {{cmd|damage}} is used. Withers summoned below Y=-82/-18 immediately die, and they gradually lose health like other mobs if they goes to the area below Y=-82/-18 from other areas.

The void's color is the same as the sky in the Overworld, showing the [[sun]] and the [[moon]]; It's dark red in the Nether, and black in the End.

=== Void fog ===
{{main|Fog#Void fog}}
In [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], black void fog and the <code>depthsuspend</code> particle effect were introduced. As the player descended below Y=17 in the Overworld, the void fog and particles would start to appear. As the player traveled deeper, the fog at the edge of the render distance would become closer until the player reached [[bedrock]], where visibility was reduced to just a few blocks, beyond which was complete darkness. The gray void particles appeared below Y=17, as well as in the void.

The void fog was removed in snapshot [[Java Edition 14w34c|14w34c]], the main reason being to improve performance.<ref>{{tweet|themogminer|501766046681153536|Removed void fog today. Now we don't need to tick air blocks (seriously, WTH?), and honestly, who actually *liked* the void fog?|August 19, 2014}}</ref> The <code>depthsuspend</code> particle effect was also removed from the void, but stayed in the game until snapshot [[Java Edition 17w47a|17w47a]] when it was removed as part of ''[[The Flattening]]''.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Unless summoned directly into the void by commands, [[shulker]]s cannot take void damage, because the damaging layer of the void is below the minimum build limit, meaning no blocks can be placed there, and Shulkers instantly teleport to the nearest block when not already connected to any blocks, so any Shulkers summoned in the void immediately teleport out without taking any damage.
* When viewed on a [[map]], the void is seen as the pattern used for an unexplored area in versions 1.10 and below. This is because there are no blocks recorded in the void's area, just the same as if the player has not explored or recorded normal areas. In versions above 1.10, the void is seen as the [[Map item format|color ID 11]] (Gray, i.e. [[Stone]]).
* {{IN|je}}, when the player is in the void, the second to last line of the [[debug screen]] is replaced by the text "Outside of world...".
* Because there is no light in the void, it can produce [[cave ambience]].
* If a player with [[night vision]] goes into the void, blocks above render as black.
* Even though the ''[[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]]'' is based on Pocket Edition Alpha v0.15.4, which had invisible barriers at Y=-41, it was completely absent from this version of the game, meaning that it is possible to fall indefinitely.
