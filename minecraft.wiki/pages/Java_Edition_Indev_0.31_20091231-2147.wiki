== Bugs ==
'''3 bugs reported'''
* Placing an item into an armor slot, then taking it out and dropping it with an open inventory allows the player to grab the armor sprite item. See the gallery for more information.
** Note that placing the sprite down causes it to disappear.
* Dropped items sometimes glitch out, creating an item that cannot be picked up, but attempting to causes the player to gain one of that item per tick. See the gallery for more information.
* Generating new world in a huge size causes the game to crash with a {{cd|java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}} error.

== Trivia ==
* This version introduced the distinction between "items" and "blocks" in the game.
