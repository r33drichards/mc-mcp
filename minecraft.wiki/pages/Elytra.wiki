'''Elytra''' are endgame equipment that can be found only in [[end ship]]s, which are located in the [[outer islands]] of [[the End]]. While worn as torso [[armor]], they allow for gliding by pressing {{Control|jump|text=jump}} while midair. [[Firework rocket]]s can be {{Control|use|text=used}} as propulsion while gliding, allowing for true flight.

== Obtaining ==
=== Natural generation ===
Elytra are found only in [[end cities]] in [[item frame]]s in the treasure room of the [[end ship]]. A [[shulker]] guards the elytra and the ship's two loot chests.

== Usage ==
[[File:Steve in elytra.png|75px]] [[File:Alex in elytra.png|75px]]

Elytra are equipped in the [[chestplate]] slot, either by placing the item directly in the slot, by pressing {{ctrl|use item}} while [[hotbar|held in hand]], or by firing a point-blank [[dispenser]] at a target. They are gray in color by default, but they adopt the design of any [[cape]] the player is wearing. They maintain their in-world texture design even when they're [[#Repairing|broken]] or [[enchanted]].

=== Flying ===
{{redirect|Glide|the [[Legacy Console Edition]] mini game|Glide (mini game)}}
To fly, the player must press the {{ctrl|jump}} key while in mid-air (e.g. while jumping or falling), and the elytra spread apart like a beetle's wings. The player can aim their view around to turn or adjust their pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed. [[Firework rocket]]s can be {{control|used}} to increase speed. Additionally, speed is quickly lost from sharp changes in direction.

The player can take [[fall damage]] while flying unless they land at a shallow angle or a low enough speed. The critical, damaging angle is about 50°. Additionally, colliding with a vertical surface while gliding too fast causes damage to the player and their armor. When a player dies in this way, they receive the [[death message]] "'''<player> experienced kinetic energy'''". Note that colliding with a horizontal surface does not cause this type of damage, so the player takes no damage when flying into a ceiling. The amount of damage caused by a collision is determined by the formula: 

<math display="block">\text{damage} = 10\times(\text{change in horizontal velocity}) - 3</math> 

A safe and simple cruise with the highest travel distance can be achieved by aiming directly at the horizon while at the glide's altitude limit. The player's speed is slow enough to allow them time to do other things during a long flight, like sort out their inventory.

A player stops gliding when colliding with a [[ladder]], as well as with all types of [[vines]] {{in|bedrock}}. Touching [[water]] also stops flight in ''Bedrock Edition''. In ''Bedrock Edition'', flight can be stopped at any moment by pressing the {{control|jump}} key.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a player in [[Creative]] mode or with the "mayfly" [[ability]] can alternatively hold the {{ctrl|jump}} key to fly up while gliding with elytra. Double-pressing the jump key enters the regular Creative flight instead. 

==== Speed and altitude ====
Elytra have a minimum speed of about 7.2 m/s (obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a strong upward pitch of 30°). A player in flight who drops to 0 speed quickly accelerates back up to at least this minimum. The player can increase speed by choosing to descend faster, but afterward, they typically do not regain nearly as much altitude. In the real world, drag increases with speed and slows an aircraft; Minecraft also mimics this.

Sharp turns are a fast way to lose speed. Quicker turns cause greater losses, while gentle movements have small effects. Making a hairpin turn can actually be used for making high-speed landings safe as well as for precise landings on small targets like rooftops. The player should aim to glide just above the target then immediately reverse direction right over the target, making adjustments as necessary.

With the right technique<ref>{{cite|url=https://youtu.be/F69K1-cMaf8?t=185|title=Finding the optimal elytra gliding angle|website=YouTube|date=Feb 24, 2025|author=Heppe (@HeppeGaming)}}</ref>, it is possible to glide as far, as high, and for as long as the player wants, until the elytra breaks. First, start from 50 blocks above the ground, though around 80 blocks up is ideal. Fly down with a pitch between 32-33° to build up speed until you lose about 60-70 blocks of altitude. Then, immediately pitch up to about -50°, and slowly pitch down by +0.5° per tick (+10° per second) until reaching 32 degrees again, and repeat. If done correctly, the player can gain 3 blocks of altitude per cycle, though it may be possible to gain up to 10 blocks of altitude per cycle on average.<ref>https://youtu.be/N3-hYjDvZS0?t=296</ref>{{more info|More specifics on this behavior}}

The lowest rate of altitude loss without changing your pitch is about 1.5 m/sec, obtained by gliding at the altitude cap with a slight upward pitch (12° or 15°).

To get the best possible glide ratio (and thus the furthest distance out of their altitude) without changing pitch, the diver pilot should aim directly at the horizon (0°). This ratio is about 10.06 blocks travelled horizontally per 1 block of starting altitude on average. This does not include the time and altitude that it takes to build up speed.

[[Slow Falling]] potions greatly decrease the player's vertical (fall) speed, which also greatly decreases their ''horizontal'' speed (clearly, it depends on the vertical fall rate, as one might expect from flight modeling). The net result is that the player flies extremely slowly - but their elytra still takes durability damage at the usual rate (1 durability per second without [[Unbreaking]]). The [[Feather Falling]] enchantment does not affect elytra speed and does not reduce fall damage from hitting things with elytra.

It is possible to calculate the glide range by dividing the altitude by the tangent of the glide angle (altitude/tan(glide angle)). For example, a player who glides from an altitude of 64 blocks above ground with a glide angle of 15 degrees can glide for 237 blocks (ignoring terrain), since floor(64 / tan(15)) is 237.

==== Stalling ====
Trying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift. At a pitch of 30° above the horizon, the player has the lowest possible airspeed of 7.2 m/sec. Above that, the player might be considered to be in a stall. Increasing the pitch gets closer to a free-fall, and stalled flight at 60° is enough to cause fall damage. Stalling at 90° is a true free-fall.

Recovering from a stall is done by readjusting to any safe pitch as quickly as the player likes. This can be just changing to look at the horizon.

==== Powered flight ====
[[File:Firework_Rocket_JE2_BE2.png|thumb|96px|Firework rockets are used for speed boosts while gliding.]]

[[Firework rocket]]s can be used for propulsion during flight by placing it in either hand and {{ctrl|using}}. Using a firework rocket while gliding quickly maximizes the player's speed for a time similar to the rocket's flight duration. If any entities are [[leashed]] to the player, they instantly detach from the player when they use a firework rocket. 

If the rocket is equipped with [[firework star]]s, it explodes at the end of its flight, inflicting damage based on the number of stars.

It is possible to gain altitude during powered flight. This makes it possible to glide for extreme distances and had been used extensively by [[far lands]]/[[World Border]] challenges.

==== Durability ====
{{fakeImage|{{invSprite|Broken Elytra|scale=4}}|A broken pair of elytra.}}

[[Durability]] decreases by one point each second when gliding. A pair of elytra has 432 durability, allowing 7 minutes and 12 seconds of gliding time without enchantments, providing more than 10,000 blocks of transport distance. It is possible to apply the [[Unbreaking]] enchantment using an [[anvil]] and an [[enchanted book]], which affects the elytra, in the same way it does to [[tool]]s. Unbreaking III increases elytra's flight time to about four seconds per durability point, a total of 28 minutes and 48 seconds.

When the durability reaches 1, elytra stop working until they are repaired, adopting a tattered texture in the inventory. The damage ends at durability 1, so they can never fully break.

The usage of [[firework rocket]]s doesn't decrease the elytra's durability.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* In reality, {{W|Elytron|elytra}} are not used for flight. They are the tough forewings of beetles and earwigs that cover the wings they actually use for flight. However, like ''Minecraft'' elytra, some beetles can use them for gliding.
* A flying player has a shorter hitbox than usual: A 0.6 block cube centered on the player's feet.
* {{IN|java}} if the player glides into deep [[water]] with elytra equipped, the animation does not stop, giving it the appearance of a [[swimming]] animation.<ref name="MC-97190">{{bug|MC-97190||While gliding into water or lava, player continues gliding|WAI}}</ref> The animation stops once the player touches the ground. Additionally, [[firework rocket]]s can be used with elytra underwater with a short boost duration.
* Elytra do not deactivate when the player flies into [[lava]].<ref name="MC-97190"/>
* Elytra can be equipped onto some [[mob]]s using [[command]]s. This has no effect unless the mob has the {{cd|FallFlying}} tag set to {{cd|1b}}. Except for [[squid]]s, mobs glide forward, unable to control the movement before landing, at which time they regain their AI.
** Exceptions to this are [[squid]]s as the squid's AI causes it to attempt swimming in midair, making it fall straight down because it conflicts with the elytra mechanics.
**Because [[chicken]]s fall slowly, they can move more distance.
** [[Endermen]], tamed [[wolves]] and tamed [[cat]]s that are not sitting cannot teleport until they hit the ground.
** Because mobs do not regain control until they hit the ground, [[vex]]es fall until they die or despawn as they cannot touch the ground. 
** Mobs capable of flying, such as [[parrot]]s or vexes can steer in air, though they cannot travel up or down. Dolphins also have this ability.
* [[4J Studios]] created an elytra-centered tutorial map for console edition when elytra were first introduced to this platform, this map is themed as "ruins of an ancient civilization of ''[[Minecraft]]'' worshippers" and showcases the new amplified terrain generation. This map can be seen behind the scenes.<ref>{{Mcnet|learning-fly|Learning To Fly}}</ref> On 28 March 2017, 4J Studios added an elytra-themed [[Mini games|minigame]] for Legacy Console Edition called "[[Glide (mini game)|Glide]];" it consists of Time Attack and Score Attack mode.<ref>{{Mcnet|glide-mini-game-consoles-tomorrow|Glide Mini Game on Consoles Tomorrow|March 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|mini-game-masters-glide-console|Mini Game Masters Glide onto Console|March 28, 2017}}</ref>
* A player who jumps with both elytra and the [[Slow Falling]] effect travels slightly upward, which is a cheap but time-consuming alternative to [[fireworks]] and [[Riptide]]-enchanted [[trident]]s.
* Mojang has considered the suggestion of combining elytra with a chestplate, but eventually decided against it, stating that elytra taking up armor is an intentional decision of game balancing.<ref>

* In [[Minecraft is turning 15]], [[Zuri]] can be seen wearing elytra. However, instead of the model, they're wearing the item itself, making the elytra disporportionately small.
