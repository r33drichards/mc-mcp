[[File:Minecraft 2.0 Spawn.png|thumb|Super Hostile mode.]]

On April 1, 2013, [[Mojang]] released a hoax announcement for '''''Minecraft'' 2.0''', a new game they had supposedly been working on for two years, describing how it would "bring blocky simulation games to the next level".<ref name="post">{{citation|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20130401191346/http://mojang.com/2013/04/its-finally-coming-minecraft-2-0/|title=It’s finally coming – Minecraft 2.0!|website=Mojang|author=Dinnerbone|date=April 1, 2013}}</ref> The post also contained a changelog comprised mostly of nonsensical changes, such as a new slab of [[TNT]] called the Etho slab, and the addition of [[Block of Coal (April Fools' joke)|coal blocks]] (which did not exist at the time).

Although lacking most of the promised additions, ''Minecraft'' 2.0 was produced and distributed to select celebrity individuals<ref name="post" /> to showcase to the public as part of the joke. Minecraft 2.0 is a fork of [[Java Edition 1.5.1|1.5.1]], and is the only joke release not available through the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''.

[[Java Edition 2.0 (preview)|A special preview edition of 2.0]] was released to YouTubers earlier to prepare their April 1 videos.

Despite being a joke, some of the features in this version were implemented in subsequent release versions.

== Versions ==
There were 3 versions of this update:
*Red
**Has super hostile mode
*Blue
**Has most of the features described here
*Purple
**Contains everything in Red and Blue versions

== Additions ==
{{Additions table|Etho Slab|Torch (Burnt-out)|[Block of Coal]Block of Coal (April Fools' joke)|White Tinted Glass|Light Gray Tinted Glass|Gray Tinted Glass|Black Tinted Glass|Brown Tinted Glass|Red Tinted Glass|Orange Tinted Glass|Yellow Tinted Glass|Lime Tinted Glass|Green Tinted Glass|Cyan Tinted Glass|Light Blue Tinted Glass|Blue Tinted Glass|Purple Tinted Glass|Magenta Tinted Glass|Pink Tinted Glass}}
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Invicon Etho Slab.png]] [[Etho slab]]'''
* Has a data value of 160.
** Also has a double slab variant with the ID 159.
* Can be crafted with 3 [[TNT]]:
{{Crafting
|ignoreusage=1
|A3= TNT
|B3= TNT
|C3= TNT
|Output= Etho Slab, 6
|Olink=Etho_Slab
}}
* Like other slabs, it can be placed on the lower or upper half of a block.
* Functions identically to normal TNT; however, when it explodes, it spawns an [[anvil]] over any mobs in its range, including players. 
** This and the block's name are references to [https://www.youtube.com/user/EthosLab EthosLab], who is a Minecraft [[YouTube]]r who often tries to kill players with falling anvils.

'''[[File:Invicon Torch (Burnt-out).png]] [[Torch (burnt-out)]]'''
* Has a data value of 161.
* Created when a [[Torch|lit torch]] burns out after a random amount of [[tick]]s.
* Can be relit with [[flint and steel]].

'''[[File:Invicon Block of Coal Revision 1.png]] [[Block of Coal (Joke)|Block of coal]]'''
* Has a data value of 162.
* Just like the other mineral blocks, it is crafted with 9 [[coal]]:
{{Crafting
|ignoreusage=1
|A1= Coal
|B1= Coal
|C1= Coal
|A2= Coal
|B2= Coal
|C2= Coal
|A3= Coal
|B3= Coal
|C3= Coal
|Output= [Block of Coal]Block of Coal Revision 1
|Olink= Block of Coal (Joke)
}}
* When crafted back into regular coal, the produced coal does not stack with other coal in the inventory, due to having a data value of 32767.
* Shows various speech bubbles when punched, and eventually strikes the ground with lightning if punched enough times.
* Was a joke, but [[blocks of coal]] were added in [[Java Edition 1.6.1|the next major update]].

'''{{AnimateSprite|White Tinted Glass; Light Gray Tinted Glass; Gray Tinted Glass; Black Tinted Glass; Pink Tinted Glass; Red Tinted Glass; Orange Tinted Glass; Yellow Tinted Glass; Lime Tinted Glass; Green Tinted Glass; Light Blue Tinted Glass; Cyan Tinted Glass; Blue Tinted Glass; Purple Tinted Glass; Magenta Tinted Glass; Brown Tinted Glass}} [[Tinted Glass (April Fools' joke)|Tinted Glass]]'''
* Has a data value of 163.
* Is opaque.
* Crafted from [[glass]] with any color the dye exists for, and yields 8 tinted glass of the corresponding color:
{{Crafting
|ignoreusage=1
|A1= Glass
|B1= Glass
|C1= Glass
|A2= Glass
|B2= Bone Meal; Light Gray Dye; Gray Dye; Ink Sac; Pink Dye; Red Dye; Orange Dye; Yellow Dye; Lime Dye; Green Dye; Light Blue Dye; Cyan Dye; Lapis Lazuli; Purple Dye; Magenta Dye; Cocoa Beans
|C2= Glass
|A3= Glass
|B3= Glass
|C3= Glass
|Output= White Tinted Glass,8; Light Gray Tinted Glass,8; Gray Tinted Glass,8; Black Tinted Glass,8; Pink Tinted Glass,8; Red Tinted Glass,8; Orange Tinted Glass,8; Yellow Tinted Glass,8; Lime Tinted Glass,8; Green Tinted Glass,8; Light Blue Tinted Glass,8; Cyan Tinted Glass,8; Blue Tinted Glass,8; Purple Tinted Glass,8; Magenta Tinted Glass,8; Brown Tinted Glass,8
}}
* Contains [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values#Data|block data]] values ranging from 0–15 that specify the color of the glass. [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values#Wool|Wool's block data values]] produce the same colors when used on tinted glass.
* In [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], tinted glass was added to the game under the name [[stained glass]].
** At its first introduction, [[13w41a]], it used the 2.0 textures, but it was changed in the next snapshot, [[13w42a]].
* In [[Java Edition 1.17]], [[tinted glass]] was added. It is unlikely that the identical naming of these blocks was intentional.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Pink Wither.png|thumb|The pink wither compared to the regular wither.]]
[[File:Redstone bug glowing in the dark.jpg|thumb|A large swarm of redstone bugs.]]
Aside from the pink wither, the mobs added are variants of preexisting mobs.

'''[[File:Horse (cow).png|32px]] [[File:Horse (pig).png|36px]] {{visible anchor|Horses and ponies}}'''
* Textures are called <code>cow_horse</code> and <code>pig_horse</code>.
* These "horses" and "ponies" can sometimes be obtained when cows or pigs are spawned with [[spawn egg]]s.
* They follow a player holding an apple or sugar, but they breed like normal cows and pigs.
* Were a joke, but [[horse]]s were added in [[Java Edition 1.6.1|the next major update]], although with a completely different appearance compared to the "horses" in this version.

'''[[File:Friendly Wither.png|32px]] [[Pink wither]]'''
* Attracted to [[sugar]], restores health to all surrounding mobs, and applies [[bone meal]] to all eligible neighboring blocks.
* It also has the ability to grow [[rose]]s, [[dandelion]]s, [[grass]] and [[fern]]s on [[grass block]]s, due to the bone meal.
* Starts off with one head. Feeding it sugar grows another head (up to three) and increases the range of these effects.
* Pink withers are spawned by placing pink wool with a [[flower pot]] containing a rose on top.
* Just like their evil counterpart, they drop [[nether star]]s.
* It is still classified as a hostile mob, though its behavior is not hostile.
* The pink wither is also considered undead, and is hurt by [[potion]]s of Healing and healed by potions of Harming.
* Unlike the normal wither, the pink wither can't fly and has no health bar.
* In the version <code>.jar</code> file the texture is named <code>wither_pink</code>.
* Pink withers were also seen in [[15w14a]], another April Fools snapshot.

'''[[File:Diamond Chicken.png|32px]] [[Diamond chicken]]'''
* Spawns instead of a normal [[chicken]] in rare circumstances.
* Lays [[diamond]]s or [[lapis lazuli]], or explodes, instead of laying [[egg]]s.

'''[[File:Redstone Bug.png|32px]] [[Redstone bug]]'''
* Has the appearance of a [[silverfish]], but with a shade of red that is the same as the [[redstone]] it spawns over.
* Spawns when a redstone error is activated, on the spot of the error.
* Has the same AI as regular silverfish.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dropper]]'''
* Has been renamed to "Flopper". However, its interface still displays "Dropper".
* Changes anything it drops to a [[raw fish]].

'''[[Furnace]]'''
* Has a new tag {{nbt|short|Heat}} that can reach from 0 to 700.
* The tag increases every [[tick]] the furnace is lit with a 50% probability.
* It decreases with a 25% probability every tick it is not lit.
* The furnace has a higher chance of spawning a large smoke particle the higher the {{nbt|short|Heat}} tag is.
* When {{nbt|short|Heat}} reaches 700 the furnace has a 25% chance of exploding every tick.
* The explosion has a power of 5 and creates fire.

'''[[Torch]]es'''
* Burn out over time, turning into [[Torch (Burnt-out)|burnt-out torches]].
* They can be relit with [[flint and steel]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Chicken]]s'''
* Are now a [[neutral mob]], and spawn reinforcements with a 25% probability when hit.
* Like [[endermen]], they attack when the player looks at them. This can be prevented by wearing a pumpkin. They have an attack strength of {{hp|4}}.

'''[[Pig]]s, [[mooshroom]]s, [[cow]]s, [[sheep]] and [[chicken]]s'''
* New tag <code>Fatness</code> with a default value of 0.
* Increases every time they are fed with the item to breed them.
* The size of body increases except for chickens.
* When the <code>Fatness</code> reaches 10 or higher the animal explodes without destroying any blocks.
* They drop up to two times their <code>Fatness</code> items.

'''[[Sheep]]'''
* Using a [[golden apple]] makes them fly.

'''[[Zombie pigmen]]'''
* Now carry "Battle[[sign]]s".

=== General ===
'''Mobs'''
* "Super Hostile Mode" is an occasional event (every 2–5 minutes on purple version).
** This mode consists of a shower of [[lightning]] bolts around the player (and usually striking the player at least once), while spawning a large number of powerful monsters in the area and applying the [[Blindness]] status effect to the player. These spawns include not only heavily armed and armored [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s, and multiple [[charged creeper]]s, but even the occasional [[blaze]] and other monsters that do not usually spawn in the [[Overworld]]. This is a reference to [http://www.youtube.com/user/Vechz Vechs'] Super Hostile series of maps. All of these are apparently triggered by "punching wood" or crafting anything. Naturally, these are some of the first things a Survival player needs to do.

'''Options'''
* Added a new option for "Super HD Graphics". When this option is turned on, it makes all textures monochrome except for recolored/secondary layer textures, such as grass side overlay or the colored glass. The "Super HD Graphics" mode does not affect the game's performance.

'''Speech bubbles'''
* Blocks and mobs can have speech bubbles containing text above their heads, simulating talking.
* List of all quotes:
** That hurts :(
** My eye!
** ..zzZZZ
** Why!?
** I'll be back!
** You didn't ....
** Oof
** (&%!@*#&%!@$#
** Ouch
** Hi there!
** That tickles
** Who's there!
** I thought we were friends
** You're mean!
** Whiiii
** Not dropping anything!
** I like you!
** I HATE you!
** YOU NO TAKE .. COBBLE!
** I'm diamond
** You punched me
** Stop punching me
** I'm dirt
** Mummy?
** SSSSSSST
** KABOOM?
** BULLY!
** I'm telling
** Creeper behind you!
** Did I do bad?
** Hello

<!-- DO NOT ADD THE DANTDM OR IJEVIN VIDEO. Said video was not released on April 1, 2013 -->

== Issues ==
2.0 is not supported due to being an [[Wikipedia:April Fools' Day|April Fools']] joke, and therefore issues affecting it are closed as "Invalid" in the issue tracker.

* [[Mooshroom]]s use the [[cow]] texture instead of the normal one.

== Trivia ==
[[File:2.0 (after 1 April 2013).png|thumb|"{{Font color|Magenta|APRIL FOOLS!}}" splash]]
* Starting from 2 April 2013, 00:00, regardless of time zone, the only splash shown is "{{Font color|Magenta|APRIL FOOLS!}}" in magenta letters and has a random size, but larger than normal.
* Lightning can strike mobs through blocks.
* The easier the [[difficulty]], the more challenging Super Hostile mode is. However, if the player changes the difficulty to Peaceful, the Super Hostile mode is disabled. This is due to Peaceful difficulty despawning hostile mobs and not allowing them to spawn.
* Burnt-out torches were originally supposed to be added in the [[Halloween Update]], where [[lantern]]s were supposed to be the new light source. However, this feature wasn't added to the Halloween Update before release and was later officially rejected.
* The textures for tinted glass, diamond chickens, and redstone bugs are all coded into the game, and are not found with the other mobs in the texture pack folders.
* The changelog contained a lot of seemingly nonsensical changes that were not included in the final release:
** It said "Fixed a bug where skeletons would miss their targets on occasion".
** It said that there were many things added to fishing, including new fish. It proceeded to note that fishing had been removed and if the player had fish in their inventory they would be damaged to discourage fishing.
* Java Edition 2.0 is the only April Fool's version that is unavailable in the launcher.
