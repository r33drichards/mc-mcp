[[File:gui_blocks.png|thumb|<samp>gui_blocks.png</samp> in [[v0.7.6]], the last version to actually use this file.]]

<samp>'''gui_blocks.png'''</samp> was a [[texture atlas]] found inside <samp>minecraft.apk</samp> that was used to load the inventory icons for the game's blocks and items.

== Format ==
<samp>gui_blocks.png</samp> is a fixed-width 512×512-pixel file that is split into different 48×48 and 16×16 squares which correspond to the texture of each block and item icon in the inventory.

== Usage ==
<samp>gui_blocks.png</samp> was used to generate inventory icons for blocks and items with a single image instead of a render to increase performance. If a block or item was not defined in this file, its inventory icon would instead get generated with <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> or <samp>[[items.png]]</samp> and have a red background.
