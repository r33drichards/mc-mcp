}}'''Mobbo''' is a character in the official ''Minecraft'' [[YouTube]] channel who has a kazoo for a voice.<ref>https://youtu.be/abs30d44yzg?t=73</ref> The character first appeared in the series [[How We Make Minecraft]], gradually becoming a bigger presence until they served as one of the main antagonists of [[Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes]].

== Appearance ==
Mobbo is a pink human-like mob with a purple smiling face shirt, crossed eyes, and a large mouth with two teeth. When "reduced to a squee-level of 24%," Mobbo is shown to resemble Steve, but with blonde pigtails.

== Personality ==
Mobbo is a [[lava]] spewing mob that griefs builds by replacing blocks with the [[Block of Eternal Screaming]] and is always hungry. Mobbo loves everyone.

== Powers and abilities ==
Mobbo's signature ability is their power to spew lava from their mouth, which has been shown to envelope entire [[Village|villages]]. As well as being able to spit lava, Mobbo can also spit saliva, similar to a llama. More dangerous than that, Mobbo is able to consume entire realities, such as save files, replacing them with a transparent abyss of nothingness.

In ''Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes'', Mobbo is also shown "replacing ''Minecraft''," causing the [[Overworld]] to transform into a copy of their head and slowly corrupt [[Biome|biomes]] with Mobbo-colored blocks. In ''WOODLAND MANSION MYSTERY'', the third episode, they can be seen eating a wooden sign, and during the finale of the show, they are able to lift Jonathan Minecraft up into the air with minimal effort, suggesting they have enhanced strength. After this feat, they are also shown drowning in lava, but in later videos shows up just fine, implying either [[Fire Resistance|fire resistance]] or a healing factor.

== Biography ==
=== How We Make Minecraft ===
Mobbo first appeared in episode 1 of the series How We Make Minecraft where [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]] thinks of a new mob that should be added to ''Minecraft''. Mobbo is given the ability to spit out lava when it sees a mob it likes, but this is changed to regular spit later on. Mobbo is also given the ability to replace and steal blocks from player's builds and replacing them with the Block of Eternal Screaming. 

=== Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft ===
In the 2021 special episode of the series, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. discovers a fan who made Mobbo in real life using cardboard. In appreciation, she asks Mobbo to build the fan in ''Minecraft'', where it then cuts to Mobbo's workshop burning. 

=== The Secrets of Minecraft ===
In the 13th episode of ''The Secrets of Minecraft'', it is revealed Jonathan Minecraft has been plotting his revenge after being fired from [[Mojang Studios]], which is invading the [[Overworld]] with Mobbo by using the machine that puts stuff into ''Minecraft''.

=== Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes ===
The Jonathan Minecraft replacing Minecraft with Mobbocraft story continues with episode 1 of the series Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes. Narrator and M.A.R.I.L.L.A. stumble across [[Mobbo's]], a supposed restaurant built by Jonathan and Mobbo as a trap filled with hostile mobs. During episode 2, Narrator and M.A.R.I.L.L.A. travel to Mobboland, a theme park built inside of a [[desert]] [[village]] populated by [[villagers]] and a [[wandering trader]] wearing Mobbo themed clothes. Narrator and M.A.R.I.L.L.A. proceed to find a [[Nether portal]] that takes them to [[the End]] which has a giant Mobbo statue, we then cut to Jonathan and Mobbo scheming phase 2 of their plan to ruin ''Minecraft''. In the next episode we see Jonathan unleashing a giant Megamobbo at [[Narrator]] and [[M.A.R.I.L.L.A.]]. In the finale we see half of the Overworld replaced with Mobbo biomes filled with pink blocks and a tall spire structure built with the Block of Eternal Screaming where we see Mobbo regretting its decision to help Jonathan. Jonathan then sets a timer for when ''Minecraft'' is replaced with ''Mobbocraft'' but as the timer is almost complete our protagonists burst in the room and a confrontation ensues which ends in Mobbo sacrificing itself to save ''Minecraft'' by throwing Jonathan in the lava pit with itself included.

== Trivia ==
* Mobbo is mentioned in [[Java Edition 23w13a or b]], specifically as a prompt to "keep ignoring Mobbo." This could be interpreted as a joke about how the events of ''Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes'' did not pose a physical threat to ''Minecraft''.
* Mobbo's dark purple shirt design resembles the epic smiley, a drawing of a smiley face with upturned eyes, which is a popular meme around the Internet.
