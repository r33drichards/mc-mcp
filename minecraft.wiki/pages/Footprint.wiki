== Trivia ==
* This is a reference to the removed [[Java Edition unused features#Footprint particle|footprint particle]], hence the "missing" dimension name.
** This item is intended as a joke directed toward the commands community where the "footstep" particle is commonly requested.<ref>https://gist.github.com/boq/8e65cb85badc75765eeb8956af78aaa5</ref>
