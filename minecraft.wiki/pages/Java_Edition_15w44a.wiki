'''15w44a'''<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20151030024129/https://www.mojang.com/2015/10/minecraft-snapshot-15w44a/</ref> is the thirty-seventh snapshot released for [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]], released on October 28, 2015.

==Additions==
===Items===
'''[[File:End Crystal (item) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[End Crystal]]'''
* Added item form.

==Changes==
===Blocks===
'''[[File:Cauldron JE7.png|32px]][[Cauldron]]s'''
* A [[bucket]] can now be filled from a full cauldron.
* The model has been changed.

'''[[End Crystal]]'''
* Can now be obtained.
* Now drops from [[Skeleton Horse|skeleton]] and [[zombie horse]]s when killed by the player.
* Can now be placed on [[obsidian]] and [[bedrock]] blocks but has no bottom plate like "normal" End crystals.
* Is now used on the exit portal in [[the End]] to respawn the dragon.
* End crystals can't be destroyed by explosions (except for withers).
* "Ender crystals" have been renamed to "End crystals"

===Items===
'''[[Golden Apple]]'''
* Normal golden apples now provide Regeneration II (was Regeneration I since [[15w37a]]).
* Enchanted golden apples can no longer be crafted.
** The achievement "overpowered" can no longer be obtained. Dinnerbone states the achievement will be changed to "obtain" instead of "craft" to fix this.<ref>https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-91552?focusedCommentId=259343&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-259343</ref>

===Mobs===
'''[[Ender dragon]]'''
* Changed the mechanic for respawning the ender dragon.
** To respawn the dragon, one End crystal must be placed on each side of the exit portal at any one of the three blocks of that side.
** While respawning, beams shoot out of these crystals, that will reset all the pillars, exit portal and [[End stone]] under the exit portal. When done they blow up and spawn the dragon.
** It is no longer possible to spawn an ender dragon by creating a creeper face using [[clay]].

===World generation===
'''[[Igloo]]s'''
* The red carpet at the corner of the igloo basement hides a block of polished [[andesite]].
* The sign has changed back to arrows though different arrows than they were initially.
** Previously:

  --><div style="height: 21px"><----</div><!--
  --><div style="height: 22px">----></div><!--
 --></div>
</div>

'''[[Tree|Large oak trees]]'''
* Now spawn in forest biomes again.

===Command format===
'''NBT tags'''
* Ender crystal
** <code>ShowBottom</code> (boolean) Whether to show the crystal "base", within the block the crystal is on top of.

===Gameplay===
'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* [[Mending]] [[Enchanting/Levels|enchantment level requirement]] lowered from 40–90 to 25–75.

'''[[Hunger]]'''
* The new saturation -> food mechanic only applies when the player is not hungry.

===General===
'''Buff Bar'''
* Now properly respects hidden & ambient effects.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* New "enchant_randomly" and "set_attributes" functions.
* Chests in mineshafts, desert pyramids, simple dungeons, and bonus chests pull loot from multiple pools, and their items were heavily rebalanced. Pools of valuable items generally precede pools of less valuable items.
** Saddle and iron horse armor were removed from [[mineshaft]] chests; name tag, enchanted and normal golden apple, torch and powered, detector and activator rails were added.
** Spider eyes, gunpowder, string, sand, and golden apple were added to [[desert temple]] chests.
** Salmon was added to [[bonus chest]]s. This chest now always contains one axe, one pickaxe, some food, and some wood items. Sticks and planks were made more plentiful.
** Added [[bone]]s, [[rotten flesh]], [[gold ingot]]s, [[coal]], [[enchanted golden apple]]s, [[melon seeds]], [[pumpkin seeds]], and [[beetroot seeds]] to [[monster room]] chests.
