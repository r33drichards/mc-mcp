A '''smithing table''' is a utility [[block]] used to apply [[smithing template]]s to [[tools]] and [[armor]]. It also serves as a [[toolsmith]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Smithing tables can be broken by hand, but using an [[axe]] is faster.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Smithing Table|Axe}}
Smithing tables drop themselves when destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Smithing tables can spawn naturally within toolsmith houses in [[village]]s. Smithing tables can also generate in [[trail ruins]].

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting

|A3= Any Planks
|B3= Any Planks
|Output= Smithing Table
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Regardless of the [[player]]'s position during placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the hammers are facing west and east, while the dark grey side is always facing up).

{{main|Smithing}}

A smithing table is primarily used for upgrading [[diamond]] gear to netherite gear and for trimming armor. The smithing interface is accessed by pressing {{control|use}} on a smithing table.

To work at a smithing table, the player must provide a smithing template in the left-most slot, a [[tool]] or piece of [[armor]] in the central slot, and an augmenting material in the right-most slot. Applying a smithing template costs no [[experience]], and preserves item data such as [[durability]] consumption, [[enchantments]], and custom names. 

Upgrading to netherite requires a [[netherite upgrade]] smithing template, a diamond tool or a piece of diamond armor, and a [[netherite ingot]].

Decorative trims can be applied to any piece of armor, including [[turtle shell]]s, by using an [[armor trim]] smithing template and a [[trim material]]. After trimming, the armor will show a decorative pattern corresponding to the smithing template with the color determined by the used material. A preview of this pattern can be seen on an [[armor stand]] model, located on the right side of smithing table's GUI.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a smithing table has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to [[toolsmith]] and claim the smithing table as their [[job site block]].

=== Fuel ===
Smithing tables can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Note blocks ===
Smithing tables can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" [[sound]]s.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia == 
* Like with the [[crafting table]], none of the tools seen on the side of the smithing table are real tools in-game.
* Even though the [[armor stand]] does not show arms when placed {{in|Java}}, the armor stand in the GUI has arms.<ref>{{bug|MC-259392||Default Armor Stand model does not match new smithing table GUI|WAI}}</ref>
