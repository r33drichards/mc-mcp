A '''ravager''' is a large [[hostile mob]] that only spawns alongside [[illager]]s during [[raid]]s. It attacks [[player]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[wandering trader]]s, and [[iron golem]]s by charging, biting, and roaring at them. A ravager can sometimes become stunned if its attack is blocked with a [[shield]].

== Spawning ==
{{Main|Raid#Raid wave composition}}

Ravagers spawn starting at wave 3 as part of a [[raid]]. Depending on the wave, [[difficulty]], and [[Raid Omen]] level,{{only|java|short=1}} they spawn independently or with a [[pillager]], [[vindicator]], or [[evoker]] that rides them as a [[ravager jockey]].

==== Spawning in ''Java Edition'' ====
* Easy difficulty:
** An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3 and the extra wave (wave 4).
* Normal difficulty: 
** An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3.
** A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in wave 5.
** 1-2 unridden ravagers spawn in the extra wave (wave 6).
* Hard difficulty:
** An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3.
** A ravager ridden by a pillager spawns in wave 5. 
** Two ravagers - one ridden by a vindicator and one by an evoker - spawn in wave 7. Both also spawn in the extra wave (wave 8).

==== Spawning in ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
Raids do not have extra waves.

* Easy difficulty:
** An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3.
* Normal difficulty:
** An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3.
** An unridden ravager and a ravager ridden by a pillager spawn in wave 5.
* Hard difficulty: 
** An unridden ravager spawns in wave 3.
** An unridden ravager and a ravager ridden by a pillager spawn in wave 5.
** A ravager ridden by a pillager and a ravager ridden by an evoker spawn in wave 7.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Saddle|notes=be_player}}
|notes =
be_player.bedrock => player_only
}}

A ravager drops {{xp|20}} [[experience]] points when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior == 
[[File:Ravager Biting BE1.gif|thumb|upright|A ravager biting.]]
Ravagers are hostile toward [[player]]s, [[iron golem]]s, adult [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s within a 32-block radius. 

A ravager attacks by running toward its target and ramming with its head, dealing a knockback of 5 blocks. A ravager also attacks by opening and closing its mouth, biting its target. {{IN|bedrock}}, ravagers may occasionally miss players when trying to attack, unlike other mobs.

When a ravager sees a villager and an iron golem at the same time, it always prioritizes the villager, unless it is already fighting the iron golem.

Ravagers do not attack [[pillager]]s who shoot them by accident, and do not attack [[evoker]]s when their [[evoker fangs]] accidentally hit them. When a vindicator riding a ravager has been named "Johnny" it may attack the ravager while it is riding it, but the ravager does not attack the vindicator for any reason. When a ravager gets hit by a mob’s projectile while it is attacking the player, the ravager first attempts to kill who shot it, then goes back to attacking the player once the deed is done. Any mob that doesn’t attack with projectiles requires a ravager to damage it with its roar in order to become hostile to it.

{{IN|Java}}, a ravager who is attacked by a player or another mob (excluding illagers and goats) alerts other ravagers in the area to target the attacker, unless the ravager was killed in one hit.

=== Stunning ===
[[File:Ravager Stunned BE1.gif|thumb|upright|A stunned ravager.]]
When a ravager’s bite attack is blocked by a [[shield]], no damage is dealt and knockback is halved, but the shield loses a considerable amount of [[durability]]. The ravager also has a 50% chance to become stunned and unable to move or attack for 2 seconds, signified by gray/purple effect particles. After this period, it opens its mouth and roars, dealing {{hp|6}} damage and a knockback of 5 blocks to nearby entities. The roar knocks back nearby illagers without damaging them and has no effect on other ravagers. Illagers knocked back by a ravager's roar can still take fall damage.

=== Joining raids and patrols ===
{{Main|Raid#Joining}}
Ravagers spawned separate from a raid (eg: from a [[spawn egg]]) may join a raid if they are within 96 blocks of the raid center when a raid wave spawns.

{{IN|java}}, ravagers can also join [[patrol]]s if they are close enough to the [[raid captain|patrol captain]].

=== Destroying blocks === 
Ravagers can also destroy some types of [[block]]s by charging through them. {{IN|java}}, ravagers can break all [[leaves]] and only some [[crops]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, ravagers can break all leaves, most [[sapling]]s, most crops, including most plants and [[mushroom]]s, [[snow]], and [[turtle egg]]s.

Ravagers cannot destroy blocks if the {{cd|mobGriefing}} [[gamerule]] is disabled.

=== Other attributes === 
Ravagers take 75% less knockback from attacks, but they still float in [[water]]. A ravager being ridden dismounts its rider if it moves into [[water]] that is at least two blocks deep. Riders cannot mount ravagers again after being dismounted.

Although ravagers have a large version of the [[saddle]] as part of their texture, they do not actually wear one, and they ''cannot'' be ridden by the [[player]]. Ravagers can only spawn in raids, sometimes with a [[pillager]], [[evoker]], or [[vindicator]]{{Only|Java}} riding them; however, another mob and even the player can be allowed to ride a ravager using the [[Commands/ride|/ride]] [[Commands|command]].‌{{Only|Java}}

{{IN|Bedrock}} ravagers have delayed hits (<code>hit_delay_pct: 0.5</code>). When set to 0.0, ravager hits wouldn't be delayed to match {{JE}}.

{{IN|Java}}, ravagers can sometimes target and damage themselves<ref>{{bug|MC-110386}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-268709||Ravagers and witches attack themselves when a "Johnny" patrol leader is nearby}}</ref>. If a vindicator that spawns as part of a [[patrol]], or as a raid captain during a raid, or has its {{cd|Patrolling}} tag set to {{cd|1b}} through commands, is named "Johnny" with a name tag, the vindicator targets ravagers in addition to other mobs. The targeted ravager targets and damages itself if the ravager does not have another target and is within the vindicator's follow range. Other illagers, witches, and ravagers also target the ravager. The ravager can kill itself without any other mob damaging it.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|ravager|illager beast}}

==Trivia==
* When the ravager was first revealed at [[MINECON Earth 2018]], it had the placeholder name of "illager beast", and kept this name for multiple snapshots and betas as Mojang listened for name suggestions from the community. In [[Java Edition 19w05a]] and [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.11.0.1]], illager beasts were named ravagers, although "behemoth" was also considered.<ref>{{snap|18w43a}}</ref>
* Ravagers originally had been designed to carry crossbows strapped to their backs but decided it was a bit much but the same effect was gotten when a pillager was placed in its back.<ref name="meet">{{Mcnet|meet-ravager|Meet The Ravager|May 11, 2019|Ash Parrish}}</ref><!--This can be found in the very bottom of the page!-->
* Ravagers were mainly inspired by the [[wikipedia:Manticore|manticore]], particularly [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Manticore the version] from [[wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons|''Dungeons & Dragons'']].<ref name="meet">{{Mcnet|meet-ravager|Meet The Ravager|May 11, 2019|Ash Parrish}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|BkbE7jf--2s|Easter Eggs Behind The...Sick Villagers? {{!}} The Story of the Illagers|Minecraft|October 27, 2024}}</ref>
** Jeb and the design team then refined it into the mob seen in-game, which is different from what inspired it.<!--The following quite from the mcnet page proves that Jeb did most of the initial design work. I've also heard somewhere that he worked on the model and animations too. I don't have a source for that. Anyways, this is a major thing that we know he worked on. Perhaps this would better fit on [[Jeb]].--><!--In designing the Ravager, Jens did his research, taking notes from popular monsters and mythological creatures. “I was mainly inspired by the Manticore from Dungeons and Dragons. It’s got this lion body with a human head, dragon wings, and a scorpion tail.” <br> Aha! That explains why the Ravager has… well, it doesn’t have a human head. Or dragon wings. Or a scorpion tale. Or look anything like a Manticore. OK, so Ravagers have exactly none of these traits, but hey, more inspiration and fewer copyright lawsuits!-->
* Ravagers have a vaguely bovine appearance, and are jokingly described as "a spicy cow" on the Minecraft.net page.<ref name="meet" /> However, they cannot be [[Milk Bucket|milked]].
*Several ravager sounds are altered versions of the sounds of other mobs:
**The first and third ravager death sounds ({{Sound||Ravager death1.ogg}} and {{Sound||Ravager death3.ogg}}) are versions of the first [[pillager]] death sound ({{Sound||Pillager death1.ogg}}) but lower pitched.
**The fourth ambient ravager sound ({{Sound||Ravager idle4.ogg}}) is the third [[evoker]] ambient sound ({{Sound||Evoker idle3.ogg}}) but lower pitched.
**The fifth ambient ravager sound ({{Sound||Ravager idle5.ogg}}) is the third [[villager]] "trade denial" sound ({{Sound||Villager deny3.ogg}}) but lower pitched.
**The third stunned ravager sound ({{Sound||Ravager stun3.ogg}}) is the first [[zombie villager]] ambient sound ({{Sound||Zombie villager idle1.ogg}}) but slightly edited.
* In a video uploaded by the official Minecraft account, ravagers were referred to as [[boss]] mobs, despite not having a [[bossbar]].<ref name="miniboss">{{ytl|4ZsbkMrSeq0&|MONSTERS OF MINECRAFT: Episode 4|Minecraft|February 3, 2023|t=237s}}</ref>
