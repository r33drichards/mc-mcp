The '''Tinies''' are a group of caricatured versions of [[Mob|mobs]] and [[Mojang Studios]] employees, typically used during [[Minecraft Live]].

== Appearance ==
The Tinies are consistently shown to possess large heads on a small body, with stubby legs and "club" arms. Typically, they are shown to resemble humans, but versions of mobs appear in the [[2023 Mob Vote Event]], including [[Pillager|pillagers]], [[Villager|villagers]], [[Enderman|endermen]], and [[Frog|frogs]]. Of the tiny mobs, the only one to possess a distinction from the original is a fisherman, who has a noticeable scar and blind eye, for no apparent reason. 

During the [[Eerie Mojang Office Party]], Tiny Jens and Agnes are presented in "grown" forms, more closely resembling traditional Minecraft characters. The reason for this is never given in the server, and ultimately reverted as of [[Minecraft LIVE - March 2025]].

== Behavior ==
Being “chibi” versions of ''Minecraft'' developers or characters, tinies possess explosive personalities. Although not particularly expressive, they exhibit bombastic traits, such as charmed language, childlike wonder, and snappy gestures. When not vocal, tinies such as the Tiny Frogs are shown being very playful, dancing blissfully out in the open.
