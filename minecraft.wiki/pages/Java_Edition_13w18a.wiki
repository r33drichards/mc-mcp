'''13w18a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.6.1]], released on May 2, 2013.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/05/minecraft-snapshot-13w18a/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Block of Coal JE1.png|32px]] [[Block of coal]]'''
* Crafted with [[coal]] in a 3×3 space.
** The block cannot be crafted with [[charcoal]].
* Can be used as furnace [[fuel]] and smelts 72 items, the equivalent to 9 coal.
* Can be used as a storage block for large amounts of coal, similarly to [[blocks of iron]] and related blocks.

=== Items ===
'''[[Lead]]s'''
* New crafting recipe: 4 [[string]] and 1 [[slimeball]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Nether fortress]]es'''
* Added [[chest]] generation.
** Chests generate in corners of interior corridors.

=== General ===
'''[[Texture pack]] system'''
* Start of a new texture loading system.
* New "[[missing texture]]" texture.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Carpet]]s'''
* Can now be placed on translucent blocks.
** This includes [[glowstone]], [[glass]], [[glass pane]]s, and [[beacon]]s.
** Beacons still function under [[carpet]]s.

'''[[Hay block]]s'''
* New crafting recipe.
* Hay blocks are crafted with [[wheat]] similarly to mineral blocks.
* Hay blocks cannot be crafted back into wheat.

'''[[Locked chest]]s '''
* Texture changed to missing texture, due to the new texture pack loading system.

'''[[Redstone comparator]]s '''
* Now output a signal for [[cauldron]]s and [[end portal frame]]s.
** A cauldron gives signal strengths that range from zero (empty) to three (full) depending on the amount of [[water]] contained inside.
** An end portal frame would give a signal strength of either zero or fifteen, depending on if an [[eye of ender]] has been inserted into it.

=== Items ===
'''[[Cocoa beans]]'''
* Removed from [[dungeon]] chests.

'''[[Horse armor]]'''
* No longer craftable.
* Can be found in [[dungeon]]s.

'''[[Horse saddle]]s'''
* Removed from the game.

'''[[Saddle]]s'''
* Can now be found in most generated [[chest]]s.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Horse]]s'''
* Tweaked horse equipment obtainability.
* Normal [[saddle]]s are now required to ride horses.
** Horses now use the same saddle that pigs use.
* Adjustments related to horses makes them more practical later in the game.

'''[[Zombie]]s'''
* Mechanic whereby [[zombie]]s spawn more zombies adjusted to be subtle and not as easily visible to the player.
* Zombies spawn in dark areas far from the player or in caves.
* No longer attack when provoked by players in [[Creative]] mode.

'''[[Creeper]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[witch]]es and [[wolves]]'''
* No longer attack when provoked by players in [[Creative]] mode.
