The '''quiver''' was an item that existed from [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091231-2147]] until [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100110]]. Like other items at the time, it was ultimately nonfunctional and only existed for testing purposes.

==Obtaining==
The quiver was obtained in the player's inventory upon creating a new world, like other items that existed in the same versions. It was not possible to obtain additional quivers from the environment or craft them from other items.

==Usage==
The quiver had no function other than existing as an item in the inventory for testing purposes.

==Development==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
Having its origins in ''[[Legend of the Chambered]]'', one of Notch's prior games, the texture was included among the first item sprites in the game. It was made unobtainable less than two weeks later when it was removed from the player's starting inventory along with most other items. Unlike the majority of the other items that existed at the time, another method of obtaining it was never added.

The quiver's texture persisted in the [[items.png]] texture atlas for much longer. Its texture was changed [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100122-2251|on the second of 22nd of January, 2010]] by flipping it horizontally from its original orientation.

The texture remained in <samp>items.png</samp> for as long as <samp>items.png</samp> itself existed, and even outlived it, becoming an individual file in [[13w02a]] with <samp>items.png</samp>'s splitting, and still not being removed in [[Java Edition 13w24a|13w24a]] with the advent of [[resource pack]]s despite many other unused textures being deleted.

Despite the quiver texture continuing to exist in the game unused, [[Jeb]] stated in 2011 he would not add quivers to the game as an item.<ref>[[User talk:Jeb mojang#Quiver|"No"]] – [[user:Jeb mojang|Jeb]], April 24, 2011</ref>

==== 1.9 and removal ====
During the development of [[Java Edition 1.9]], [[Dinnerbone]] posted a 2×204960 image on Twitter<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|595224755126534144|The following picture is meaningless and is probably not even worth your time clicking on it.|May 4, 2015}}</ref> which could be reformed into a 854×480 ''Minecraft'' screenshot, clearly depicting the quiver as a usable item in the survival inventory, where it had what seemed to be a dedicated slot alongside a slot for [[arrow]]s.<ref>{{reddit|34too2/nathan_adams_on_twitter_the_following_picture_is|cqxxz2i|context=0|It's not meaningless.|FiredPlayer (now deleted)|May 4, 2015}}</ref> He shared another screenshot of the quiver in the creative inventory a few weeks later.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|601714812436029440|I also had to rearrange the Creative inventory a little, too, to make the new slots fit. I don't think it's too bad.|May 22, 2015}}</ref>

On June 30, 2015, Dinnerbone stated he had scrapped the idea as he felt that holding arrows in the off-hand felt "more natural."<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|615853908553019393|I'm removing quivers again. Arrows in off-hand feels more natural.|June 30, 2015}}</ref> With there no longer being any planned future uses for the texture, it was ultimately removed in [[Java Edition 15w31a|15w31a]], 1.9's first snapshot.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
The quiver texture was also present in ''Pocket Edition''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <samp>items.png</samp> file from the beginning. It survived the replacements of items.png and its successor [[items-opaque.tga]], and still exists in ''Bedrock Edition''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s vanilla resource pack.
