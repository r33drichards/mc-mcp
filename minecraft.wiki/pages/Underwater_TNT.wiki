'''Underwater TNT''' is a [[block]] that can be used by the [[player]] to initiate a controlled [[explosion]] underwater.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Underwater TNT can be broken instantly with anything. However, primed underwater TNT cannot be broken, as it is an [[entity]].

== Usage ==
{{main|TNT#Usage}}

Underwater TNT blocks can be activated the same way as a normal [[TNT]] block.

=== Behavior ===
Once activated, it explodes like a normal TNT block. However, unlike the traditional TNT block, it can destroy [[block]]s underwater. It can still explode in the air, although it does not work in [[lava]]. Underwater TNT has the same delayed detonation rate as normal TNT.

== Trivia ==
* The inclusion of [[Element|sodium]] is a reference to elemental sodium's explosive reaction with water. All alkaline metals react with water violently to form hydrogen gas and a hydroxide. The heat generated often ignites the gas.
