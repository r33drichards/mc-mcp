'''MC Championship''', commonly abbreviated as '''MCC''', is a monthly fan-organised ''[[Minecraft]]'' tournament developed by the [[Marketplace]] partner [[Noxcrew]] and creator [[Scott Major]]. The tournament features 10 teams of 4 players, typically large content creators playing in minigames. It hosts an event usually once every month with breaks in between seasons. Noxcrew also hosts a Java Edition server known as MCC Island containing several games found in MC Championship.<ref>https://mcchampionship.com/</ref>

On May 27, 2024, the 13th day of the [[15 Days of Minecraft]], it was announced that [[Mojang Studios]] would be officially hosting an MC Championship event, the [[Ender Cup]], in the summer of 2024.<ref>{{Mcnet|mcc-x-minecraft|MCC x Minecraft|May 27, 2024|Linn Viberg}}</ref> Alongside this, a two-week long, in-game [[MCC x Minecraft 15th Anniversary Party|live event]] "inspired by both the history of MCC and 15 years of ''Minecraft''" would occur in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''.<ref>{{Mcnet|mcc-x-minecraft-the-ender-cup-almost-here|MCC x Minecraft: The Ender Cup is almost here|July 16, 2024|Cristina Anderca}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
The event starts off by placing players in the Decision Dome, the place the contestants will vote before each round. They will all be given [[egg]]s which they may throw into a central cylinder to hatch a [[chicken]]. The cylinder is divided into several segments, all correlating to a game. The segment with the most chickens in it is the chosen game. Players may receive power-ups throughout the event which they may use to direct the chickens into the segment of the game their team would like to play.<ref name="contest info">https://mcchampionship.com/event</ref>

Once a game is chosen, the contestants will have to compete to earn the most coins for their team. Coins are typically earned by completing the objective, surviving and eliminating contestants from other teams. Coins are multiplied the longer the event goes on, so there is an incentive to play certain games that teams excel at later into the event to maximise the amount of coins obtained.<ref name="contest info"/>

At the end after 8 games have been played, the first and second place teams by coins are placed into a grand finale game called Dodgebolt, inspired by the real life game of Dodgeball. Contestants are given a [[bow and arrow]] and must defeat the other team in a best-of-five to determine the event's winner.<ref name="contest info"/>
