* Has this ever existed in Bedrock Edition? [[Special:Diff/1946013/1946039|This edit]] seems to imply so.
* Apparently, air item entities can be generated in 1.4 - early 1.5 dev via jukeboxes: [https://mcdf.wiki.gg/wiki/Java_Edition:Air_(Item_Entity)]}}
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w38b|Air now has an item form corresponding to its block ID, which can be obtained via the {{cmd|give}} command or inventory editors with numeric item ID 0. It is not intended to be obtained in conventional gameplay.
|It is also dropped in quantities of 0-2 by entities with no actually defined item drops:
* [[Slime]]s above size 1
* Adult [[villager]]s
* The [[ender dragon]]
* [[Bat]]s
* [[Silverfish]]
* [[Giant]]s
|However, air is ''not'' dropped by the following:
* [[Player]]s
* [[Magma cube]]s of size 1
* [[Wolves]]
* [[Ocelot]]s
* Baby animals
|Air blocks cannot be placed in spaces which are themselves air. However, they can be placed in blocks such as [[water]] and [[grass]], as well as probably any other replaceable block.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=13w38c|The direct item form of air has been removed from the game. It can once again no longer exist as an item in any way, only as a placed block.
|It is still, however, suggested with the {{cmd|give}} command.<ref>{{bug|MC-108872|resolution=Works As Intended}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w42a|Breaking [[frosted ice]] with a [[Silk Touch]] tool would create an invisible air item entity. This cannot be picked up by the player directly, but could by hoppers; interacting with such a hopper results in an instant crash.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=15w45a|Frosted ice no longer drops air.<ref>{{bug|MC-90635}}</ref>}}

==== Appearances ====
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w38b|[[File:Missing Texture JE3.png|32px]] The air item uses this texture in inventories, as a dropped item or when in an item frame.
|[[File:Blank.png|32px]] The air item is completely invisible when held in first or third person view.
|[[File:Missing Texture (anisotropic filtering) JE3.png|32px]] If anisotropic filtering is set to a nonzero value, the missing texture is a 4x4 checkerboard, resulting in this item's appearance changing.}}
