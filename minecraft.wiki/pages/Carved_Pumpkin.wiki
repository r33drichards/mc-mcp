A '''carved pumpkin''' is a [[block]] obtained by {{Control|use|text=using}} [[shears]] on a [[pumpkin]]. It is used to craft [[Jack o'Lantern|jack o'lanterns]], build [[golem]]s, and can be [[Armor|worn]] as a [[helmet]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Carved pumpkins can be mined using any tool, but [[axe]]s are the quickest way.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Carved Pumpkin|Axe|sword=1|link=none}}

When a carved pumpkin is pushed by a [[piston]], it breaks and drops as an [[Item (entity)|item]]. It cannot be pulled.

=== Natural generation ===
Carved pumpkins generate in rail rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s, as well as in [[pillager outpost]]s as a part of scarecrows.

=== Mob loot ===
The carved pumpkin of a [[snow golem]] can be obtained by [[shearing]] its head, revealing the golem's face. The carved pumpkin cannot be put back on the golem.

=== Post-generation ===
A carved pumpkin (and 4 [[pumpkin seeds]] {{in|Java}} or 1 unit of pumpkin seeds {{in|Bedrock}}) is obtained by {{control|use|text=using}} [[shears]] on an uncarved pumpkin. Once carved, a pumpkin cannot be changed back to uncarved. This changes the rotation of the top texture.{{only|Java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-122685|||WF}}</ref>

== Usage ==
When placed, a carved pumpkin automatically faces the [[player]]. However, {{in|Java}} the stems are directional, meaning the stem will point towards the face, while {{in|Bedrock}} the stems are non-directional, meaning the stems always face northwest just like normal [[pumpkins]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Carved Pumpkin}}

=== Helmet ===

| [[File:Alex wearing Carved Pumpkin.png|thumb|right|128px]]
|}
A carved pumpkin can be equipped as a helmet without any actual [[armor]] value. When worn, it limits the [[player]]'s viewing area to a mask pattern that resembles the pumpkin's carved face. The pattern does not appear when using the [[third-person view]] (toggled by {{key|F5}} by default). {{IN|Java}}, it also doesn't appear when the [[heads-up display]] is disabled by pressing {{key|F1}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-121536||The carved pumpkin overlay disappears when pressing F1|WAI}}</ref>

A player wearing a carved pumpkin does not aggravate [[endermen]] or freeze [[Creaking|creakings]] when looking at them. Wearing a carved pumpkin makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]] and [[locator bar]].

{{iN|JE}}, the following entities will visually appear as wearing a carved pumpkin if summoned as such with [[commands]]:
{{columns-list|
* {{EntityLink|Armor Stand}}

=== Dispensers ===
[[Dispenser]]s can equip a carved pumpkin on a player, mob or [[armor stand]] with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing. It can also place the carved pumpkin as a block, if a snow, iron, or copper golem can be spawned after the pumpkin is placed.

=== Building golems ===
{| style="float:right"

| [[File:Iron Golem.png|thumb|128px|Iron golem]]
| [[File:Copper Golem.png|thumb|128px|Copper golem]]
|}
Carved pumpkins can be used to make [[snow golem]]s, [[iron golem]]s, and [[copper golem]]s as shown below. Snow golems require [[snow block]]s for their bodies, iron golems require [[iron block]]s, and copper golems require [[copper block]]s. The carved pumpkin must be placed last or the golem does not spawn. The orientation of the carved pumpkin does not matter while building any golem.

{{FakeImage|align=none|style=display:inline-block;margin:0|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Carved Pumpkin|s=Block of Copper| p | s }}|Copper golem build configuration}}

=== Enchantments ===
Carved pumpkins can receive the following enchantments, but only through an [[anvil]].

{|class="wikitable col-2-center col-3-right"

=== Composting ===
Placing a carved pumpkin into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Note blocks ===
Carved pumpkins do not produce didgeridoo sounds when placed under a note block, unlike regular pumpkins.<ref>{{bug|MC-145068|||WAI}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Carved Pumpkin}}

== Trivia ==
* The carved pumpkin is the only headgear that obstructs the [[player]]'s view.
* The function of using the carved pumpkin as a headgear might be a reference to the web-comic "[https://www.homestuck.com/jailbreak Jailbreak]" where one of the main characters carved a pumpkin that got stuck on his head to see.
* A carved pumpkin enchanted with [[Curse of Binding]] cannot be removed from a player's helmet slot unless the player dies, since it does not lose [[durability]] like armor does.
** In [[Hardcore]] mode, such a carved pumpkin effectively stays on the player forever.
