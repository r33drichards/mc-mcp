The '''glow squid''' is a variant of the normal [[squid]] found in dark underwater areas, typically in [[ocean]] depths, [[canyon]]s, and [[Aquifer|underground lakes]]. It has an aqua luminescent texture, and is the only source of [[glow ink sac]]s.

== Spawning ==
{{IN|Java}}, schools of 4 to 6 glow squid spawn in [[water]] (source block or flowing) in complete darkness in the [[Overworld]] below [[Altitude|layer]] 30, except for the [[deep dark]] biome. Unlike most other aquatic mobs, they do not require water or waterlogged blocks above or below their spawning space. In all spawnable biomes, the spawn weight is {{frac|10|10}} and the spawn chance is 100%.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, glow squid spawn anywhere in any [[dimension]] where there's water underground,<ref name="glow_squid_bedrock">{{bug|MCPE-130734}}</ref> in schools of 2 to 4 (below a solid roof categorized as cave spawn, while squid are surface spawns) anywhere below Y=30 in a light level of 0 except [[deep dark]] biomes. The spawn weight is 10 in all spawnable biomes except [[mangrove swamp]], in which the spawn weight is 100.

Glow squid have a 5% chance of spawning as babies.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Glow Squid Shooting Ink.png|thumb|The turquoise ink cloud produced by a glow squid.]]
Glow squid are [[passive]] toward the player. They are not attracted to light and do not deliberately interact with the player. Glow squid sometimes beach themselves<ref>{{bug|MC-132473||Squid and glow squid can swim one block above water}}</ref> and suffocate on the banks of rivers and occasionally on ocean beaches. These behaviors are shared with the traditional squid.

Glow squid wander around aimlessly in three dimensions as long as they are in the water, opening and closing their tentacles, which gives them the appearance of pushing themselves leisurely forward.

A glow squid's hitbox does not include its tentacles, and therefore cannot be damaged by attacking its tentacles.

Glow squid suffocate when out of water, dying after {{convert|15|second|game tick}}. While on land, they remain stationary until they suffocate.<ref>{{bug|MC-240990|||WAI}}</ref> They can take fall damage and [[fire|burn]] like any other land mob, but they cannot drown. When out of the water, glow squid are extremely resistant to [[knockback]].

Glow squid appear to glow, but do not produce block lighting. They stop glowing for {{convert|5|second|game tick}} when harmed. They are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]], and the light pixels glow especially strongly.

Glow squid cannot swim in lava, even if inflicted with [[Fire Resistance]]. They simply pass through the lava and behave as if on land.

{{IN|be}}, a glow squid can survive on land with [[Water Breathing]]. However, they still cannot move.

Unlike land-based mobs, glow squid can swim against a current and not get pushed by it.{{only|je}}

[[Guardian|Guardians]] and [[Elder guardian|elder guardians]] attack glow squid in the same manner as they would a player, even if the glow squid is affected by [[Invisibility]]. [[Axolotl|Axolotls]] also attack glow squid.

Glow squid are affected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment — {{in|Java}} because they are [[aquatic mob]]s; {{in|Bedrock}} as long as they touch water.

Glow squid constantly produce crystalline particles around them. When attacked, they emit a cloud of turquoise ink particles and swim away. The particles and the ink remain visible when the glow squid has the [[Invisibility]] status effect.

If the player is in [[Spectator]] mode or is far away from glow squid (often when they are in unloaded [[chunk]]s), they remain stationary. When attacked in this state, the squid cannot flee.<ref>{{bug|MC-212687||Squid and glow squid stop moving if player is a little far from them}}</ref>

Like a land-based mob, a glow squid can be picked up by a [[minecart]].

Unlike most “animal” mobs, glow squid cannot [[breed]]. Baby glow squid can be found only when they naturally spawn. A baby glow squid eventually turns into an adult after 24000 ticks (20 minutes), and their growth cannot be sped up.
