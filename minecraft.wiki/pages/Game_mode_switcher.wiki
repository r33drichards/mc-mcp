The '''game mode switcher''' is a feature {{in|java}} that allows the player to quickly switch between different [[game mode]]s with keyboard hotkeys, when [[commands]] are enabled.

== Usage ==
The game mode switcher is activated on a combination of [[debug hotkey]], when {{key|F3}} is held down and {{key|F4}} is then pressed. The game mode choice can be made by pressing {{key|F4}} repeatedly until the game mode of choice is outlined. When {{key|F3}} is released, that game mode is selected and applied to the [[player]]. The game mode options are, in order, [[Creative]], [[Survival]], [[Adventure]], and [[Spectator]]. The game mode initially selected when the screen is opened is whatever game mode the player was last in. Before the game mode has been changed at all, the default selection is Creative if currently in any other game mode or Survival if currently in Creative mode.
