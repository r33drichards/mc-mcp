'''Leaf litter''' is a thin decorative block resembling fallen leaves. Up to four can be placed in the same block space.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Leaf litter can be mined using any tool or without a tool.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Leaf Litter}}

A leaf litter is also removed and drops as an item if:
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed.
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space.
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space.

The amount of leaf litter items dropped is equal to how many were present in the block space beforehand (i.e. a leaf litter block with 3 placed drops 3 leaf litter items when destroyed).

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Screenshot Leaf Litter in Dark Forest.png|alt=A Dark forest biome with Leaf Litter on the ground.|thumb|Leaf litter in a dark forest.]]
Leaf litter generates naturally in [[forest]]s, [[dark forest]]s, and [[wooded badlands]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Smelting ===
Leaf litter can be created by smelting any type of [[leaves]] block.
{{Smelting
|Any leaves
|Leaf Litter
|0.1
|ingredients=Any [[Leaves]] block + Any [[Fuel]]
}}

== Usage ==
{{info needed section|Table of biome colors}}
=== Placement ===
Leaf litter can be placed on blocks that have a full solid top surface. Up to four pieces of leaf litter can be placed in a single block space. When placed, a leaf litter faces the location of the player placing it.

=== Fuel ===
Leaf litter can be used as fuel for smelting. It burns for 5 seconds, smelting {{frac|1|2}} of an item. 1 stack of leaf litter smelts 32 items.

=== Composting ===
Using leaf litter on a [[composter]] has a 30% chance to raise the compost level by 1. A stack of leaf litter yields an average of 2.74 [[bone meal]].

=== Color ===
[[File:Dry foliage.png|thumb|128px|right|<code>dry_foliage.png</code> colormap]]
{{main|Block colors#Dry foliage colors}}
Leaf litter takes on a different color depending on the [[biome]] it is placed in. It is colored with different shades of brown in most biomes or gray in [[pale garden]]s. The color applied in most biomes is determined by the <code>dry_foliage.png</code> [[Color#Biome colors|colormap]].
