== Description ==
Like all other hills biomes, snowy taiga hills featured hillier, more erratic terrain. These hills were somewhat steep, making this variant difficult for survival. Although this was a snowy biome, [[River|rivers]] generated inside snowy taiga hills were not replaced by [[Frozen River|frozen rivers]]. Pillager outposts and villages generated in this biome{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, however, unlike the regular snowy taiga, [[Igloo|igloos]] didn't generate here.

== Mobs ==
Snowy taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as snowy taigas.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
