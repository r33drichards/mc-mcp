A '''bush''' is a non-solid [[plant]] block found in many grassy [[Biome|biomes]]. Its color is biome-dependent, and matches the color of [[Grass Block|grass blocks]]. 

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Attempting to mine a bush with or without any [[tool]] will instantly destroy it, but breaking the bush with [[shears]] or any item with [[Silk Touch]] is required for the bush to actually drop as an item.

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:River bank bushes.png|thumb|right|Bushes as they naturally generate.]]
Small [[vegetation|patch]]es of bushes naturally generate in [[birch forest]]s, [[old growth birch forest]]s, [[forest]]s, [[plains]], [[windswept hills]], [[windswept gravelly hills]], [[windswept forest]]s, and on the shores of [[river]]s and [[frozen river]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
Using bone meal on a bush attempts to grow another bush on a neighboring block.

== Usage ==

=== Placement ===
Bushes mainly serve as atmospheric decoration and can be placed on any of the following blocks:{{columns-list|* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}|style=column-count:2}}

Bushes cannot be placed inside [[flower pot]]s.

{{IN|bedrock}}, bushes can be [[snowlogged]].

=== Composting ===
Placing a bush into a [[composter]] has a 30&nbsp;% chance of raising the compost level by 1, yielding an average of 2.74 [[Bone Meal|bone meal]] per stack.
