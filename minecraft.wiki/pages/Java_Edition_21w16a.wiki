'''21w16a''' is the eighteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on April 21, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w16a|April 21, 2021}}</ref> which adds dripstone growth and the ability to grow azalea trees.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Pointed dripstone]] growth'''
* If a stalactite is hanging from a [[dripstone block]] with a water source above, it slowly grows both the stalactite from above and a stalagmite from below.
** Growth speed is random but very slow; a single growth step can take several in-game days.
* A stalactite only grows up to 7 blocks long.
* A stalactite only causes stalagmite growth if the floor or stalagmite below is within 10 blocks.
* If the stalactite tip is inside water it doesn't drip, and therefore doesn't trigger any growth.
* If the stalagmite tip is inside water or there is a fluid between the two dripstone blocks, it doesn't receive the water drops, and therefore doesn't grow by a dripping stalactite.
** A stalagmite or stalactite never grows into a fluid.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>moss_replaceable</code> block tag.
** Contains the [[Tag#blocks base_stone_overworld|#base_stone_overworld]] tag, the [[Tag#blocks cave_vines|#cave_vines]] tag, and the [[Tag#blocks dirt|#dirt]] tag.

'''[[Language]]'''
* Added Russian (Pre-revolutionary) language.
* Added Chinese Traditional (Hong Kong) language.

=== Experimental ===
Changes have been made to the official Caves & Cliffs world generation preview data pack, which gives early access to the world generation coming in [[Java Edition 1.18]].

'''[[Ore vein]]s'''
* Large rare snaking collections of [[ore]] found underground.
** Copper mixed with granite is found at and above Y=0; iron mixed with tuff is found below Y=0.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Azalea]] and [[flowering azalea]]'''
* Can now be fertilized with [[bone meal]] to form azalea trees.

'''[[Block of raw iron]] and [[block of raw gold]]'''
* Tweaked the textures.

'''[[Emerald ore]]'''
* Now attempts to generate 6-24 times per [[chunk]] in [[mountains]], instead of 1 time.
* The deepslate variant can now generate naturally.

'''[[Infested deepslate]]'''
* Can now have random texture rotation like deepslate.

'''[[Small dripleaf]]'''
* The model was slightly changed.
* The upper leaf is now correctly connected with stem.{{more info}}

'''[[Grass block]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]'''
* Grass, tall grass, ferns, tall ferns, sweet berry bushes, saplings, flowers, azaleas, sugar cane, dead bushes, and bamboo can now be placed on these blocks.
* Pumpkins and melons can now grow onto these blocks.
* Endermen can now pick up these blocks.

=== Items ===
'''[[Raw metal]]'''
* Tweaked the texture of raw ores.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* The recipes for stonecutting [[diorite]] into polished diorite slabs and stairs now unlocks when the player has diorite as opposed to polished diorite.

=== General ===
'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Renamed the statistic for play time to <code>play_time</code>.
* Included time when game paused for "Time with World Open" (<code>total_world_time</code>).

'''Resource pack prompt'''
* Users who previously permanently declined server resource packs are now still shown the pack prompt if the pack is mandatory, instead of being immediately disconnected.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added grass blocks, mycelium, and moss blocks to the <code>dirt</code> block tag.
* Tweaked some tags to no longer unnecessarily mention blocks if they're in the dirt block tag.
* Tweaked the <code>lush_ground_replaceable</code> block tag to call the <code>moss_replaceable</code> tag instead of the <code>lush_plants_replaceable</code> tag, as well as adding gravel and sand.
* Removed the <code>lush_plants_replaceable</code> block tag.

'''Textures'''
* Removed the unused <code>rooted_vines_head.png</code> texture.
* Removed stray pixels from the recipe book GUI button.

=== Experimental ===
Changes have been made to the official Caves & Cliffs world generation preview data pack, which gives early access to the world generation coming in [[Java Edition 1.18]].

'''[[Aquifer]]s'''
* Aquifers below Y=0 are sometimes made of [[lava]].
