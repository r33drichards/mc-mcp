An '''azalea''' is a solid block that can be grown into an [[azalea tree]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Azaleas can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] using any tool or by hand. Harvesting an azalea with [[shears]] consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.

An azalea also breaks if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if [[water]] flows into it.
{{breaking row|Azalea|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Azaleas generate commonly on top of [[moss block]]s in [[lush caves]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
When decayed or mined with any tool except [[shears]] and tools enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], [[azalea leaves]] have a 5% chance to drop azaleas. The [[Fortune]] enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II and 10% at level III.

When {{ctrl|using}} [[bone meal]] on a [[moss block]], each block in a 3×3 to 7×7 area has a 15% chance of growing an azalea.

== Usage ==
Azaleas can be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[podzol]], [[moss block]]s, [[farmland]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], and [[clay]].

Unlike most transparent blocks, mobs can spawn on top of azaleas {{in|java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-214293||Mobs can spawn on top of azaleas}}</ref>.

=== Composting ===
Putting an azalea in a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of increasing the composting level.

=== Fuel ===
Azaleas can be used as a fuel source in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.5 items per azalea.

=== Growing trees ===
Unlike saplings, an azalea does ''not'' automatically grow into an [[azalea tree]]. Therefore, using [[bone meal]] on it is the only way to grow an azalea tree. Application of bone meal gives an azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3×5×3 area above it that is clear of all blocks, except for leaves and logs.
