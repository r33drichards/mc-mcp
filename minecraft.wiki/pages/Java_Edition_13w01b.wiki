'''13w01b''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on January 4, 2013<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106225905/http://www.mojang.com/2013/01/minecraft-snapshot-13w01b/|title=Minecraft Snapshot 13w01b|website=Mojang.com}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[13w01a]] snapshot.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Chest]]s'''
* All containers output a redstone signal when a [[comparator]] is placed against it directly. 
** The strength of it depends on how full the container is.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|287286424624066560}}</ref>
* This works with trapped chests as well, meaning it can provide two redstone signals with different causes at the same time.

'''[[Hopper]]s'''
* [[Rail]]s can now be placed on top of hoppers, which allows emptying [[chest minecart]]s.
