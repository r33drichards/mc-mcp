Going from fullscreen to non-fullscreen causes Minecraft to grab my mouse, but not my keyboard, and it's not in menu mode. So the only way to stop it is to manually kill the java process or alt+F4 out of Firefox. And then there's still the thing where mouse focus is permanently lost after unfocusing and refocusing on Minecraft."..."16:21:08 <Notch> vede: Yeah, I know.. I will try to fix that now"}}</ref>
