A '''bucket of salmon''', internally known as a '''salmon bucket''', is a living [[salmon]] inside of a [[water bucket]].

== Obtaining ==
A bucket of salmon can be obtained by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on a [[salmon]]. Once a water bucket is used, the salmon is picked up along with the water source block.

== Usage ==
Pressing {{control|use}} with a bucket of salmon places a [[water]] source block, and spawns the salmon back into the world, leaving an [[bucket|empty bucket]] in the [[player]]'s [[inventory]]. Placing a bucket of salmon in [[the Nether]] causes the same [[particle]]s to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the salmon is spawned alone.

Salmon caught in buckets then released do not despawn, unlike mobs that spawn naturally in their aquatic environments.

If a bucket of salmon is inside a [[dispenser]], the dispenser spawns the salmon and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up a salmon when using a water bucket, due to the bucket being emptied instead.

If a bucket of salmon is named a certain name through an anvil, the salmon inside displays that name as if it were named with a name tag.{{Only|java}} Alternatively, if a named salmon is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of salmon shares a name with the captured salmon.{{Only|java}} If a named salmon is captured {{in|Bedrock}}, the item is called "Bucket of <''name''>".
