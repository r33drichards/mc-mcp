A '''netherite hoe''' is a late-game variant of [[hoe]] obtained by upgrading a [[diamond hoe]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]]. It is used to [[till]] [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks into [[farmland]], and to break [[leaves]], [[haybale]]s, and [[Sculk family|sculk-related]] blocks faster. It is the highest [[tier]] of hoe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, damage{{only|BE|short=1}} and [[enchantability]] than a [[diamond hoe]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a [[diamond hoe]] can be upgraded to a netherite hoe, increasing its [[durability]] and [[mining efficiency]], as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Hoe#Usage}}

=== Harvesting ===
Hoes are used to harvest certain plant-based or organic blocks more quickly. Breaking one of these blocks takes 1 [[durability]].

Breaking any other block takes 0 durability if the block breaks instantly when broken by hand, or 1 otherwise.

=== Tilling ===
Hoes are used to turn dirt, grass blocks, and dirt paths into [[farmland]]. To till, press {{control|use}} on a grass or dirt block while holding a hoe. This does not work on [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]],<ref>{{bug|MC-8231||Mycelium and podzol cannot be tilled with hoes}}</ref> nor does it work if there are other blocks on top of the targeted blocks, including [[snow layer]]s or [[torch]]es. However, mycelium and podzol can be first converted to dirt paths with a shovel, then tilled into farmland with a hoe.

Hoes can be used to convert [[coarse dirt]] into regular dirt by pressing {{control|use}} on the coarse dirt. Similar to tilling dirt, the space above the coarse dirt must be empty for it to be tilled.

Hoes can also be used on [[rooted dirt]], which turns it into normal dirt, and yields a [[hanging roots]] item.

Tilling is effectively instantaneous, regardless of material, and uses 1 durability. Breaking blocks with a hoe uses 0 or 1 durability, depending on the block.

Hoes are unable to work on blocks with a plant on top, even if that plant could normally be placed on top of farmland without reverting it to dirt.<ref>{{bug|MC-167846||Hoe cannot be used on blocks with certain blocks on top even if said blocks can normally exist on farmland|WAI}}</ref>

=== Weapon ===
Hoes may be used as a weapon, although they deal only {{hp|1}} damage {{in|java}}. {{IN|bedrock}}, hoes can do as much as a pickaxe in terms of damage. Hoes use 1 durability when used as a weapon.

In ''Java Edition'', netherite hoes have an attack speed modifier 0 (refill in 0.25s).

Hoes always attack instantly in ''Bedrock Edition''.

A netherite hoe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding netherite ingots, with each ingot restoring 507{{only|JE|short=1}} or 508{{only|BE|short=1}} durablity (25% of its maximum durability, rounded down). Two netherite hoes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the hoe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A hoe can receive the following enchantments:

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Tilling a [[dirt]] block that has a dirt block on top of it changes it to [[farmland]] even though it cannot be used. If a hoe is used on a [[block]] horizontally adjacent to such a block, the first block reverts to dirt and the selected block is not tilled.
* When a hoe breaks while tilling dirt, it does not display the tool breaking animation like on other tools, because tilling is not predicted client-side.
