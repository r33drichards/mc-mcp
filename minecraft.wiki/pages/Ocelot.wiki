An '''ocelot''' is a [[trustable]] [[passive mob]] found in [[jungle]]s. They run away from nearby [[player]]s, but their trust can be gained by feeding them [[raw cod]] or [[raw salmon]]. [[Creeper]]s, as well as [[phantom]]s {{in|bedrock}}, stay away from ocelots.

== Spawning ==
Ocelots [[Mob spawning|spawn]] above [[grass block]]s in [[jungle]] biomes at the world's [[sea]] [[Altitude|level]] (Y-level 63 per default). Ocelots spawn in groups of 1-3{{Only|je|short=1}} or 1-2{{Only|be|short=1}} adult ocelots 95% of the time or as babies 5% of the time. There is a small chance for two baby ocelots to spawn when an adult ocelot spawns naturally. Ocelots can spawn at a light level of 7 and above and are found in all kinds of jungle biomes {{in|be}}. {{IN|java}}, ocelots spawn as part of the "monster" group; as a counterbalance, there is a {{frac|1|3}} chance for a spawn attempt to fail in jungles and spawning does not occur in [[bamboo jungle]]s or [[sparse jungle]]s. Because of this, while ocelots are passive [[animal]] mobs, they cannot spawn at all on Peaceful [[difficulty]].<ref name="hostile kitty" /> Even though ocelots spawn as part of the "hostile" mob cap, they are not restricted to spawn within 128 blocks of the player, but will spawn like passive mobs in chunks close to the player.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Adult ocelots drop {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. Killing a baby ocelot yields no experience.

=== Breeding ===
Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.

== Behavior ==
Ocelots are immune to [[fall damage]], but still avoid falls. Similar to [[fox]]es, ocelots attack [[chicken]]s and baby [[turtle]]s they see within 15 blocks. Like [[cat]]s, they [[sneak]] and stalk their prey until they are within 4 blocks, then chase it down. They can kill through a [[fence]], [[fence gate]], or [[door]] if they are against it.

[[Creeper]]s stay six blocks away from ocelots. A creeper within this range that has begun its detonation does not flee unless the player leaves its blast radius. [[Phantom]]s stay 16 blocks away from ocelots in ''Bedrock Edition''.

[[File:Ocelot1.png|thumb|left]]
With the exception of a faster movement rate, baby ocelots have the same behavior as adults.

Ocelots are one of the few mobs that can [[sprint]], and they sprint away from nearby players in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode.

Ocelots approach players holding [[raw cod]] or [[raw salmon]] within 10 blocks. If the player moves, turns their head too quickly, or stops holding the item while within 6 blocks, the ocelot flees and does not attempt to approach the player again for a few seconds.

Ocelots cannot be tamed. Instead, a player can gain an ocelot's trust by feeding it raw cod or salmon until heart particles show, causing it to no longer flee from players. Each food item has a {{frac|1|3}} chance of gaining the ocelot's trust.

In ''Bedrock Edition'', ocelots that are trusting do not despawn. In ''Java Edition'', trusting ocelots despawn like other mobs when beyond 128 blocks from the player unless named or in a boat.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Ocelot.png|thumb|width=165x165|An ocelot ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult ocelot that is not trusting to form a [[jockey]].{{-}}

== Breeding ==
{{main|Breeding}}
When a trusting ocelot is fed [[raw cod]] or [[raw salmon]], it enters love mode. {{IN|BE}}, breeding creates a baby ocelot that trusts the player. The adults cannot breed again for 5 minutes once they have completed breeding. The growth of baby ocelots can be accelerated using cod or salmon; each feeding takes 10% off the remaining time to mature.
