'''Minecraft Live 2025: Announcement Trailer''' is the announcement trailer for [[Minecraft LIVE – March 2025]].

== Summary ==
{{Expand section}}A black area is shown, with spotlights on a [[goat]], an [[enderman]], [[Makena]], a [[skeleton]], a [[zombie]], [[Sunny]], a [[chicken]], a [[pig]], and a warm [[cow]], all of them dancing as the spotlights rotate between the characters. The view shifts to an animal pen with warm cows, a chicken, two [[plains]] [[farmer]] [[villagers]], and Sunny in the middle, changing again to a house with some pigs nearby, with large, floating text saying "March 22" in front. The view shifts once more to the black area, showing some cold cows walking sideways up stairs, then showing some temperate cows slightly dancing, then looking at each other.
