A '''moon cow''' is a variant of a [[cow]] that spawns on [[the Moon]]. They function similar to the cow, except they walk backward and wear [[glass]].

== Spawning ==
[[File:MoonCowGroup.png|alt=A group of Moon Cows in The Moon Dimension.|thumb|A group of Moon Cows in [[The Moon]] Dimension.]]
Moon cows spawn on the surface of [[cheese]] blocks on [[the Moon]] in groups of 1-5.

== Drops ==
An adult moon cow drops:
*1-3 {{ItemLink|glass bottle|glass bottles}}, average of 2.
*0-2 {{BlockLink|cheese}}, average of 1.
*0-1 {{ItemLink|bone|bones}}, 50%. 
*0-1 {{BlockLink|glass}}, 10%. Glass can drop only on a player kill.

Killing a calf yields no [[item]]s and no [[experience]] drop.

== Behavior ==

=== Breeding ===
{{Main|Breeding}}

A moon cow follows a player who holds [[wheat]] but stops following if separated from the player by at least six blocks.
[[File:MoonCowAndCalf.png|alt=A Moon Cow with a baby Moon Cow.|thumb|A Moon Cow with a baby Moon Cow.]]
Adult moon cows enter love mode and pair off to create calves after they are given wheat, granting the player 1–7 [[experience]] orbs. The parent cows have a cooldown of five minutes before they can breed again. The growth of calves can be accelerated using wheat; each use reduces the remaining growth duration by 10%. 

Baby moon cows take 20 minutes to grow and follow adult cows, preferring them instead of a player holding wheat. The moon calf that results from breeding attempts to go to the nearest available block to its parent, even if no path can be found. A moon calf pathfinds to other adult cows if it is separated from its parent by more than 24 blocks. Normal calves also follow moon cows, but moon calves do not follow normal cows.

=== Balloons ===
Like regular [[cow]]s, moon cows can be fed [[Air (April Fools joke)|air]] to turn them into balloon cows and go back to the Earth. The glass bottles dropped by them allow the player to craft new air if they run out of it. After reaching Y=689, the cow explodes with a firework blast and gives the player [[Nausea]] II and [[Levitation]] II for 20 seconds.

== Sounds ==
Moon cows use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

== Trivia ==
*Moon cows walking backward is a reference to the dance move [[wikipedia:Moonwalk_(dance)|moonwalk]], where through a visual trick a dancer appears to walk backward.
*Moon cows have their own [[spawn egg]], but they are only obtainable through [[commands]] or the <code>spawn_egg_chance</code> [[Java Edition 23w13a or b#Commands|Vote]].
*Moon cows are unable to breed when the condition that allows craftable air blocks is enabled, as they are mounted instead of fed when right clicked with wheat.
