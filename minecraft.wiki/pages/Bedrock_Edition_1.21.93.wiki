'''1.21.93''' is a hotfix for ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' released on July 3, 2025<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/37810171798029-Minecraft-1-21-93-Bedrock|title=Minecraft - 1.21.93 (Bedrock)|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=July 3, 2025}}</ref>, which fixes some bugs, and adds the "[[Music Disc Lava Chicken|Lava Chicken]]" music disc.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Music Disc]]'''
* [[File:Music_Disc_Lava_Chicken_JE1_BE1.png|width=32x32]] Added the [[Music Disc Lava Chicken|"Lava Chicken" music disc]] by [[Hyper Potions]].
** Obtained by killing a [[zombie]] while it is riding a [[chicken]] (a [[chicken jockey]]).
*** If the chicken is killed before the zombie is, the music disc is not dropped.
** Has a [[comparator]] output of 9 when played in a [[jukebox]].

== Changes ==
=== Technical ===
'''[[API]]'''
* Added a new condition {{cd|passenger_of_entity}} that allows checking which vehicle entity type is being ridden by the damaged entity that is dropping loot.
** Like {{cd|damaged_by_entity}}, allows specifying an {{cd|entity_type}} field to check against when deciding which entry in a loot table to select.
* Added a new condition {{cd|is_baby}} that allows checking if the entity that is dropping loot is a {{cd|baby}}.
