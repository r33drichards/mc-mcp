A '''chest''' is a [[block]] used to store [[item]]s.

A '''large chest''' is the combination of two adjacent chests, and can store twice as many items.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A chest can be broken using anything, but an [[axe]] is the fastest. Chests always drop themselves when mined. If the chest contains items, the items are also dropped when the chest is broken. If one half of a large chest is destroyed, the corresponding items from the destroyed chest ({{in|Java}}, the top three rows for the left-hand chest or the bottom three for the chest on the right; {{in|Bedrock}}, the top three for whichever half was placed first or the bottom three for whichever half was placed last) are dropped and the remaining half continues to function as a small chest.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Chest|Axe|foot=1}}

{{IN|Java}}, a chest produces oak plank particles when breaking, walking or falling on this block;<ref>{{bug|MC-2614||All kinds of chests produce wrong particles when ran on/punched|WAI}}</ref> {{in|Bedrock}}, a chest produces particles of the block itself.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Chest loot}}
Chests generate naturally in all three dimensions. They can generate in [[monster room]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[village]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, [[desert pyramid]]s, [[nether fortress]]es, [[end cities]], [[igloo]] basements, [[woodland mansion]]s, [[shipwreck]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[buried treasure]], [[pillager outpost]]s, [[bastion remnant]]s, [[ruined portal]]s, [[ancient cities]] and [[trial chamber]]s.

Large chests can occasionally generate in [[monster room]]s by one single chest generating next to the other. They can also generate in certain types of [[bastion remnant]]s.

==== Bonus chest ====
{{main|Bonus chest}}
The bonus chest is a chest that appears near the player's spawn if the "Bonus chest" option is toggled on the [[world creation]] screen. It generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including wood, tools, blocks, and food.

== Usage ==
Chests can be used as containers and are an ingredient in some crafting recipes.

A chest placed adjacent to another chest joins to create a large chest. A player can prevent this, and place two small chests side by side, by {{control|sneaking|sneak}} while placing the second chest {{in|java}}, pushing a chest into place with a [[piston]] {{in|bedrock}}, or placing the second chest facing a different direction from the first chest. Alternatively, [[trapped chest]]s do not combine with normal chests.

{{IN|bedrock}}, chests can be moved by pistons. [[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around chests without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to chests as if the chests were flammable, but the chests do not actually catch fire and cannot be burned.

=== Container ===
[[File:Chest GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|The GUI of a chest.]]
[[File:Large Chest GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|The GUI of a large chest.]]

A small chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large chest has twice that amount, at 54 slots. In the ''Java Edition'' interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half. In Bedrock Edition, the top three rows correspond to whichever half was placed first and the bottom three to the other half.

Chests open when {{ctrl|used}}. To move items between the chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. {{IN|java}}, holding {{key|Shift}} and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them. To exit the chest GUI, use the {{key|Esc}} control.

A chest cannot be opened if there is a [[conductive]] block above it ({{in|bedrock|lc=}}, bottom slabs prevent chests from being opened). Solid faces do not prevent chests from opening, so the lid of the chest can phase through blocks such as bottom-half [[slab]]s, [[stairs]], and [[non-conductive]] full cubes such as [[glass]] and [[ice]]. [[Cat]]s sitting on chests prevent them from opening. Because chests themselves are non-conductive, two chests can be stacked on top of one another while still allowing the lower chest to be opened. Players can open chests when they are being hurt ([[effect]] of Instant Damage, Poison, Wither, on fire, damaged by other [[player]]s or [[mob]]s, etc.).

By default, the GUI of a chest is labeled "Chest" and the GUI of a large chest is labeled "Large Chest". A chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the chest in an [[anvil]] before placing it, or, {{in|java}}, by using the {{cmd|data}} command (for example, to label a chest at (0,64,0) as "Bonus Chest!", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'"Bonus Chest!"'<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}). If half of a large chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large chest, but if the named half is destroyed the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large chest have different names, the GUI uses the name of the northernmost or westernmost half.

{{IN|java}}, a chest can be "locked" by setting its {{nbt|compound|lock}} tag using the {{cmd|data}} command. If a chest's {{nbt|compound|lock}} tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item that matches the item predicate in the <code>lock</code> tag. For example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named "Chest Key", use {{cmd|data merge block 0 64 0 <nowiki>{lock:{components:{"custom_name":"Chest Key"}}}</nowiki>}}.

The capacity of a chest varies greatly, depending on its size, whether the items inside it are stackable, and whether [[shulker box]]es are used. The minimum capacity is obtained when storing only non-stackable items while the maximum capacity can be achieved when storing items that stack to 64. Filled shulker boxes are not stackable, but each can hold 27 stacks of up to 64 items (excluding other shulker boxes), so filling a chest with them increases the maximum by a factor of 27.

=== Donkey, mule, or llama pack ===
A chest can be added to a [[donkey]], a [[mule]], or a [[llama]] by pressing {{control|use}} on the animal.

A chest attached to a donkey or mule has only 15 slots. A chest attached to a llama has anywhere from 3 to 15 slots depending on its "Strength" value (see {{Section link|Llama|Data values}}). The chest cannot be removed except by killing the carrier. The chest can be opened by holding {{control|sneak}} and pressing {{control|use}}, or by riding the carrier and pressing {{control|inventory}}.

If shulker boxes are again used, each donkey, mule or strength value 5 llamas with a chest attached to it can carry up to 405 stacks of items (up to 25920 items), and with strength value 5 llamas, each caravan of 10 llamas with inventories full of shulker boxes can carry up to 4050 stacks of items (up to 259200 items).

=== Copper golems===
[[Copper golem]]s can sort items into chests. If a copper golem is holding an item, it visits the nearest chest within 32 blocks horizontally and 8 blocks vertically to try to place the item in. It takes 3 seconds to stop at each chest it visits.

A copper golem places the item it is holding either if the chest is empty, or if the chest contains the same type of item. {{IN|java}}, a copper golem cannot distinguish between different [[potion]] contents or [[suspicious stew]] types, but it can {{in|bedrock}}. In both editions, a copper golem ignores durability, enchantments, shulker box contents, custom names, or any other data.

If it cannot place the item in, the copper golem moves on to the nearest chest it hasn't visited. The copper golem can remember up to 10 chests it has visited. If it has already visited 10 chests and still cannot place the item, it wanders around for 7 seconds, forgets which chests it has visited, and continues searching for a chest to place the item in.

If the chest a copper golem is walking towards can no longer be opened (e.g. a chest has a cat sitting on it) or is destroyed, the copper golem marks the position as visited and move on. This occupies one of their 10-chest memory.

Copper golems do not simultaneously open a chest that another non-player entity is already interacting with.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s become hostile toward [[player]]s who open or mine chests.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Fuel ===
Chests can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per chest.

=== Note blocks ===
Chests can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce the "bass" sound.

== {{anchor|Xmas chest}} Christmas chest ==
{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}

From December 24 to 26, chests, large chests, their trapped chest counterparts, and copper chests have their textures changed to "Christmas chests", which look like wrapped Christmas presents. Since the game uses the date stored on the player's computer, players can apply the Christmas chest textures at any time by changing the date on their computer to December 24, 25, or 26.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*The chest recipe is not unlocked by any specific item, but rather, having enough slots in the inventory occupied by any item.
*In Pocket Edition, a player who leaves the game while standing on a chest rejoins the game with legs inside the chest.
*If the tick speed is set to "freeze" through [[Commands/tick|/tick]], the chest does not show opening or closing animations but it still makes sounds.
*{{IN|java}}, when in [[Creative]] mode, if pick block + ctrl is used on a naturally generated [[Generated loot|loot chest]] (or by modifying the data of a normal chest using {{command|/data}}), instead of displaying the first few items inside like a [[shulker box]], it will just display "???????" due to the loot not being generated yet. Placing the chest and opening it will result in a different loot table every time. The same thing also happens with [[barrel]]s and [[shulker box]]es.
