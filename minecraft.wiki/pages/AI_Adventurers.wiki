=== AI 101: Building the Basics ===
==== Summary ====
As a metaphor for older forms of information gathering, the agent and chicken go fishing, beginning with a pool. Agent's [[fishing rod]] accidentally pulls out a drain, which sucks up all the [[water]] and a rubber duck, depressing the agent. The two wander out into a teal void, where they find a series of computers and servers. As the narrator explains AI, the computers are revealed to be in the shape of the word AI. Soon, the chicken volunteers to explain AI against its will, being shoved onto a chair at a fancy table where the agent gives hundreds of [[books]]. This represents machine learning.

After being shown many books, the chicken then looks at a laptop, and then a smartphone, before just getting a pile of books. This process takes so long that the agent rests on a [[bed]], sleeping through the tedium. Having gone through everything, the chicken has learned many things. This pivots to a sequence of connections, such as books about tigers often mentioning cats, while websites on cats rarely mention cars, pictures of cars often including [[Wolf|dogs]], and scientific studies of dogs never mention saxophones. Having found "millions and millions of patterns," the chicken wakes the agent up, and goes out to test predictions starting with [[fish]] not being found in [[trees]], [[Short Grass|fields]], cups, or puddles. It is correct. They go to a lake, and find a whale, incentivizing them to double check what AI puts out.

As the narrator stresses that generative AI was new at the time, the agent catches a [[Raw Cod|cod]].
