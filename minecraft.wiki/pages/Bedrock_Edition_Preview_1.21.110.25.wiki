'''[[Copper Golem]]'''

** If it does not see the container, it fails to open it.

'''[[API]]'''
* Moved {{cd|LootTableManager}} API from beta into 2.2.0.
* Changed the following methods on {{cd|Dimension}} to have the read-only privilege so they can be called in "before" events:
** {{cd|getWeather}}, {{cd|findClosestBiome}}, {{cd|getBlockAbove}}, {{cd|getBlockBelow}}, {{cd|getTopmostBlock}},
** {{cd|getLightLevel}}, {{cd|getSkyLightLevel}}.
* Moved {{cd|ItemBookComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|V2.2.0}}.
* Moved {{cd|BookError}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|V2.2.0}}.
* Moved {{cd|BookPageContentError}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|V2.2.0}}.

*** Moved {{cd|getRawLore(): RawMessage[]}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|V2.2.0}}.
** {{cd|ContainerSlot}}
*** Moved {{cd|setLore(loreList?: (RawMessage | string)[]): void}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|V2.2.0}}.
*** Moved {{cd|getRawLore(): RawMessage[]}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|V2.2.0}}.

'''Experimental'''
* Camera custom FOV command no longer requires the "Experimental Creator Cameras" experimental toggle.
* The experimental "Custom Biomes" option has been removed.
** This change has not been mentioned in the changelog.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the Beta APIs, and Upcoming Creator Features [[experimental]] toggles.

=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[API]]'''
* Added new method {{cd|isChunkLoaded}} to {{cd|Dimension}} which returns true if a chunk at an area is loaded and ticking.
* Added enum {{cd|HeldItemOption}} to {{cd|beta}} for {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions}}. This specifies options related to the item currently being held at the time of a player swing:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
export enum HeldItemOption {  
    AnyItem = 'AnyItem',       
    NoItem = 'NoItem'  
}
</syntaxhighlight>
* Added interface {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions}} to {{cd|beta}}. Event options/filters for {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent}}. - Field {{cd|heldItemOption?: HeldItemOption}}
** Added class {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent}} to {{cd|beta}}. This contains information regarding a player starting to swing their arm:
*** Field {{cd|heldItemStack?: ItemStack}}.
*** Field {{cd|player: Player}}.
** Added class {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfter.EventSignal}} to {{cd|beta}}. This event is fired at the start of a player's swing (e.g. attacking, using an item, interacting). It can be subscribed/unsubscribed via {{cd|world.afterEvents.playerSwingStart}} and optionally filtered by passing in {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions}}.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Added component {{cd|minecraft:redstone_producer}} behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.

'''Components'''
* Added new block component {{cd|minecraft:flower_pottable}}:
** It is an empty component defined as such: {{cd|minecraft:flower_pottable: <nowiki>{}</nowiki>}}.
** When the component is present on the block, > a player can interact with an empty flowerpot when holding the block in order to embed it.
** Similar to other Vanilla pottable blocks, a player can remove the potted block by interacting with the pot with an empty hand.
** The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.
** Pottable not potable.
* Added new block component {{cd|minecraft:embedded_visual}}:
** The component has two required fields, {{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}}, similarly to {{cd|minecraft:item_visual}}.
** When the component is present on the block, it defines which {{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}} to use when the block is embedded into another block, eg. into a flowerpot.
*** If the component is not present, embedded blocks fallback to their innate {{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}}.
*** The component cannot be defined in the {{cd|permutations}} section; only one embedded visual can be achieved per block type.
** The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.
* Added new field {{cd|embedded}} to the {{cd|item_display_transforms}} object:
** The field defines the overall transformation this geometry should be subject to when embedded into a block, eg. a flowerpot.
** If the field is not defined, the default transformation is a 0.75x scale, similar to the one applied to most Vanilla flowers.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[API]]'''
* Expanded {{cd|LootTableManager}} {{cd|beta}} functionality, which now allows for loot table discovery via the new {{cd|getLootTable}} method.

'''Components'''
* Modified {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}} to support weighted variations textures with these requirements:
** {{cd|format_version}} must be greater than or equal to {{cd|1.21.110}}.
** World must have "Upcoming Creator Features" experiment enabled.
