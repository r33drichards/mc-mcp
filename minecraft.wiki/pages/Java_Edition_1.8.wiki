'''[[File:Slime Block JE1.png|width=32x32]] [[Slime Block]]'''
* Crafting recipe: 9 [[slime ball]]s.
** Can be crafted back into 9 slime balls.
* Players and mobs that land on their top side bounce, like on a trampoline.
** This negates all fall damage.
*** Holding {{key|shift}} negates the rebound, and does not negate the fall damage.
** Bounce rebound velocity is scaled by impact velocity.
*** Height can reach up to 60% of initial height, which implies a great restitution coefficient.
** Does not affect falling item entities.
* Walking on it is slower than walking on [[soul sand]] and close to one's speed while sneaking.
* The placing/breaking sounds use the hurt sounds of [[slime]]s.
* Can be mined with only one click, without any tools in Survival.
* Slime blocks push and pull each other, along with adjacent blocks, when at least one of them is moved by a sticky piston.
** Normal pistons have the same effect, except that they fail to pull even a single slime block.
** Coded by [https://www.youtube.com/user/KaboPC KaboPC] and [https://www.youtube.com/user/Panda4994 Panda4994].<ref>{{ytl|jpXBKXJlybg}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|461189042659672064|You guys got that really fast. It was http://gfycat.com/ImperturbableMeanCuckoo, a feature that wouldn't be possible without the ZipKrowd guys' hard work <3|April 29, 2014}}</ref> Follow all the existing rules that pistons followed:
*** A chain of slime blocks and its adjacent blocks connected to a piston, in any arrangement, can be moved as long as the following conditions are met:
**** The piston is not moving more than twelve blocks at a time.
**** Non-movable blocks are not obstructing the path.
**** Not a single slime block in the chain is attached to the piston itself.
** Allows for moveable contraptions.
* Extending a piston with a slime block attached propels adjacent entities (mobs, players, items, launched arrows, etc.) in the appropriate direction.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|461473908420796416|I don't think anyone has found it yet, so I'll go ahead and spoil it: Standing on a slime block that gets pushed up is lots of fun.|April 30, 2014}}</ref>

* Crafted like signs, but with one color of wool instead of planks.
** The color of wool represents the base color.
* Can be stacked to 16.
* Most patterns are created by arranging dyes in certain ways around a banner on a crafting table (see the page on banners for a full list).
** Other patterns are achieved with specific items.
*** Item – pattern: "creeper head – creeper face", "wither skeleton skull – skull and crossbones", "brick block – brick texture background", "oxeye daisy – flower icon", "vines – curly border" and "enchanted golden apple – Mojang logo.
*** Making these patterns without dyes results in a black color by default
* Banners can have up to six layers (in Survival).
** Over a quadrillion possible combinations, counting rotations and visually identical patterns due to occlusion.
** The layers show in the order they were created.
** Custom banners with more than six layers are possible using commands.
* Top-most layer can be removed using cauldrons.
** This removes a third of the water of a full cauldron.
** All layers can be removed.
* Can be placed on walls or on the ground.
* They are visually like an entity that is one block wide and two blocks tall, but in reality they are a block occupying the lower portion, but having a bigger model.
** The hitbox is smaller than a full block, and it lacks any collision properties.
*** This allows for a solid block to occupy the upper portion of the banner.
** They are vulnerable to be destroyed by either water or lava flows.
** On the ground they have 16 different possible rotations (like an [[armor stand]]).
** Has an animation when placed on the ground, that simulates swaying with the wind.
* Can be worn as head gear, but only using the {{cmd|replaceitem}} command.
* Can be cloned by crafting them together, with a blank banner of the corresponding base color.
* Can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s.

**** Main noise scale X/Y/Z to smooth out terrain, larger values for smoother terrain; biome scale/depth weight and biome scale/depth offset to stretch/squash terrain vertically based on the biomes default height settings; upper/lower limit scale to make terrain more solid/riddled with holes, depending on how close the values are to each other; height stretch to pull terrain upward, with smaller values causing more extreme stretching; height scale, coordinate scale, depth base size, depth noise exponent and depth noise scale.
* There are seven presets: "Water World", "Isle Land", "Caver's Delight", "Mountain Madness", "Drought", "Caves of Chaos", and "Good Luck".
* Each page has a button to randomize the various values and a button to reset to default values.
* Uses the 'generator-settings' string known from superflat presets for server.properties and world data.
* Generate structures button disappears when selected.

'''[[Debug mode]] world type'''
* Useful for [[resource pack]] makers.
* Hold {{key|shift}} and cycle through "World Type" option to select it.
** Other world options are not available.
** Only [[Spectator]] mode can be enabled upon spawn, but it can be reverted through commands once inside.
* All possible blocks with all possible data values (not IDs), are generated throughout a single plane.
** They are arranged in a grid across height Y=70, with a [[barrier]] block flooring at Y=60.
** This includes all possible states of [[redstone]] wire, [[fire]], [[tripwire]], [[stairs]], etc.
** Every block state generates only once.
* Blocks may not be placed or destroyed.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Achievement]]s'''
* New achievement ''Overpowered''.
** Obtained by crafting an [[enchanted golden apple]].
** Requires first obtaining ''Getting an Upgrade''.

'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* New enchantment, [[Depth Strider]].
** Allows the player to move faster while in water.
** Can be applied only to boots in Survival up to level III.

'''[[Spectator]] game mode'''
* It can be accessed and reversed only via {{cmd|gamemode}}, either using <code>spectator</code>, <code>sp</code>, or <code>3</code>.
* It is the default [[gamemode]] on the debug [[world type]].
* Like in [[Creative]] mode, only the void and {{cmd|kill}} can damage/kill a spectator.
* Their player model in the inventory is completely invisible.
* Free roaming:
** The [[world border]] has no effect on spectators (apart from the warning colors displaying).
*** They still can't exit the [[world boundary]].
** The player can fly through solid blocks (noclip).
*** If the head of the player is inside of a block, then an x-ray like effect happen, where every block is invisible until it is adjacent to an intermidiate air block, or the model does not occupy a full block.
** The mouse scroll wheel, the sprint key, the Slowness and Speed effects, all affect the flying speed.
*** Night Vision effect also affects spectators.
* First-person view through another player or mob's eyes.
** Includes non-mob entities like [[painting]]s or [[minecart]]s
** [[Creeper]]s, [[spider]]s and [[endermen]] apply a specific shader while spectating through each of them.
** Spectating through a player shows the respective HUD.
** Pressing the dismount key (shift by default), returns the player to flying mode.
* Viewing privileges:
** Cannot catch on [[fire]], so their view isn't obstructed.
** Spectators can see other spectators as disembodied translucent heads, with the corresponding player skin.
** All invisible players/mobs appear visible, but translucent.
** An optional held hotkey shows bright outlines on all players.
*** Can be color-coded to teams.
** Spectators can look at the inventories of blocks like [[chest]]s and entities like [[minecarts with chests]].
*** This includes their own [[inventory]].
* Automatic targeted teleportation-spectators have a UI to teleport to other players.
** The UI can be brought up and interacted with, using the number keys or middle mouse click.
*** But the scroll wheel can still scroll through the different options.
** It is similar to the regular hotbar in Creative (it displays on the [[HUD]]), but contains special icons that appear to be different items, like [[barrier]] blocks or old [[player head]]s.
*** If there is at least 1 team set up, the UI distinguishes between teleporting to an individual or teleporting to a member of a specific team.
**** Otherwise it defaults to an all-inclusive, alphabetical list of players (except for fake players).
***** Team members are still sorted the same way, inside their own lists.
**** Both the player and the team icons are color-coded with respect to the team color.
**** The player icons that teleport are rendered with the skin of the head of the player, and resemble the way the [[player head]]s were displayed before 1.8.
*** If there are more than 8 players or 7 teams available to teleport, slots 1 and 8 display right and left arrows respectively, to scroll through.
**** The arrows look similar to the ones used in the resource pack menu and the server list.
**** The right and left arrow do not appear if there are no more players to the right or left of the list respectively.
*** There is always an option in slot nine to close the menu.
**** Looks like a barrier block item.
** Teleportation works across [[dimension]]s.
*** It is slightly more delayed on those cases, since it has to load the world first.
* A spectator cannot:
** Load terrain. (Later, gamerule <code>spectatorsGenerateChunks</code> was added to toggle whether they can load chunks or not)
** Interact with [[block]]s or [[entities]], apart from spectating through the latter.
** Interact with any [[inventory]] (including their own).
** Look at the inventory of other players/mobs, apart from the hotbar [[items]] of players.
** Control the behavior of any entity they spectate through.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Target selectors]]'''
* <code>@e</code>
** Targets all entities including players.
** Can specify the type of entity by entity ID, to either include or exclude with <code>[type=Chicken]</code>, to apply it only to chickens or <code>[type=!Skeleton]</code>, to apply it to every entity that isn't a skeleton.
** Examples:
*** {{cmd|1=kill @e[r=50,type=Chicken]}} Kills every chicken within a radius of 50 blocks.
*** {{cmd|1=tp @e[r=5] ~ ~5 ~}} Any entity within a radius of 5 blocks is teleported 5 blocks upward.

'''[[Commands]]'''
* {{cmd|kill}}
** Removed "Ouch! That looked like it hurt" message.
* {{cmd|execute}}
** Allows commands to be run from the position of specified entities.
** A <code>detect</code> argument allows the {{cmd|execute}} command to run only if a block is detected at a specific location relative to the target.
** Syntax:
*** {{cmd|execute <entity> <x> <y> <z> <command…>}}
*** {{cmd|execute <entity> <x> <y> <z> detect <x2> <y2> <z2> <block> <data> <command…>}}
** Examples:
*** {{cmd|execute @a ~ ~ ~ detect ~ ~-1 ~ minecraft:grass 0 say You are standing on grass.}} Makes everyone who is standing on grass say that they are doing so.
*** {{cmd|1=execute @e[type=Chicken] ~ ~ ~ fill ~-1 ~-1 ~-1 ~1 ~1 ~1 minecraft:glass}} Creates a small cube of glass around all chickens.
** Commands run using the {{cmd|execute}} command, pass their success value back to the command block running them.
* {{cmd|trigger}}
** Functions the same way as {{cmd|scoreboard players set}} or {{cmd|scoreboard players add}}, but can modify only objectives with the <code>trigger</code> criteria (referred to as "triggers"), and can modify only the score of the player running the command.
** Allows non-op players to use <code>clickEvent</code>s as well as to prevent its abuse.
** Can be used by non-operator players.
** For a player to run this command, the trigger must be enabled for that player.
*** {{cmd|scoreboard players enable <player> <trigger>}} enables the specified player to use the specified trigger objective.
*** Trigger availability is stored per player.
**** One trigger may be disabled for a player, but that player can use a different trigger.
**** One player may be unable to use a trigger, but another player can use the same trigger.
*** Disabled after the trigger has been used (must be re-enabled to use the trigger again).
** Mostly for use with {{cmd|tellraw}}.
** Syntax: {{cmd|trigger <objective> <add:set> <value>}}.
* {{cmd|replaceitem|<entity{{!}}block> ...}}
** Can replace items in any inventory, including the inventories of mobs such as [[villager]]s.
** Syntax:
*** {{cmd|replaceitem entity <entity> <slot> <item> [amount] [data value]}}
*** {{cmd|replaceitem block <x> <y> <z> <slot> <item> [amount] [data value]}}
** Example:
*** {{cmd|1=replaceitem entity @e[type=Zombie] slot.weapon minecraft:iron_sword 1 0}} Gives all the zombies iron swords.
*** {{cmd|replaceitem entity @p slot.hotbar.0 minecraft:fish 4 2}} Puts 4 clownfish in the players first hotbar slot.
*** {{cmd|replaceitem block ~ ~1 ~ slot.container.5 minecraft:redstone_block 1 0}} Puts a redstone block in the 6th slot of a container, 1 block above the player.
* {{cmd|blockdata}}
** Modifies NBT data at a specific coordinate, <code><dataTag></code> merges with the block at that position.
** Syntax: {{cmd|blockdata <x> <y> <z> <dataTag>}}.
** Examples:
*** {{cmd|/blockdata 294 4 302 (Items:[])}} Clears all items of a container at those coordinates.
*** {{cmd|/blockdata ~ ~-1 ~ (Lock:"TEST")}} Assigns a locked tag to a container adjacent to the command origin with the password: Test.
* {{cmd|entitydata}}
** Works similarly to {{cmd|blockdata}}, but for entities.
*** Does not work on [[player]]s.
** Syntax: {{cmd|entitydata <entity> <dataTag>}}.
** Example: {{cmd|1=entitydata @e[type=Sheep,r=20] {Color:14}}} Colors all the sheep within a radius of 20 red.
* {{cmd|clone}}
** Clones all the blocks from a given area to a different given area.
** Up to 32768 (32{{^|3}}) blocks can be copied at once.
** The command accepts the tags: <code>replace</code> , <code>masked</code> or <code>filtered</code>.
*** <code>replace</code> copies every block (default).
*** <code>masked</code> copies only non-air blocks.
*** <code>filtered</code> removes specified blocks.
** It can additionally accept the tags: <code>move</code>, <code>force</code> or <code>normal</code>.
*** <code>move</code> moves the selection from the first location to the second location, which may overlap.
*** <code>force</code> forces the cloning operation, even if the areas overlap.
*** <code>normal</code> needs to be specified only if using <code>filtered</code>.
** Syntax: {{cmd|clone <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <x> <y> <z> [mode]}}.
** Example: {{cmd|clone 1001 3 1002 1011 3 992 1001 5 992 masked}} Targets the cuboid volume defined by the opposite corners: [1001,3,1002],[1011,3,992] and clones it such that the old corner coincides with the destination (and orientation) at [1001,5,992].
* {{cmd|fill}}
** Fills a given volume with a specified block.
** It cannot replace or fill [[block entities]] with specific data tags.
** Up to 32768 blocks can be filled.
** Syntax: {{cmd|fill <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> <TileName> [dataValue] [oldBlockHandling] [dataTag]}}.
*** The <code>oldBlockHandling</code> parameter determines the fate of the blocks, occupying the volume about to be filled,
**** It takes the same values here as it does in {{cmd|setblock}}: <code>destroy</code>, <code>keep</code> and <code>replace</code> – as well as two additional values:
***** <code>hollow</code> to fill only the outer layer of blocks, and fill the inner part with air,
***** <code>outline</code> to fill the outer layer of blocks, and keep the inner part the same.
** Example: {{cmd|fill 1001 3 1002 1011 5 992 wool 6 replace}} Fills the given area with pink wool.
** It can be made to filter specified blocks.
*** Syntax: {{cmd|fill [x] [y] [z] [x] [y] [z] [BlockName] [Data] replace [filterBlockName] [filterData]}}.
* {{cmd|testforblocks}}
** Compares two areas of a world, to check if they share the same blocks on the same configuration (including orientation).
** The mode can be set to <code>all</code> or <code>masked</code>
*** <code>all</code> is the default, while <code>masked</code> ignores air blocks.
** Syntax: {{cmd|testforblocks <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2> [mode]}}.
** Example: {{cmd|testforblocks 100 64 100 107 69 107 0 64 0 masked}}.
* {{cmd|stats <entity{{!}}block> ...}}
** Updates a scoreboard objective for an entity, based on the number of entities/blocks which have been affected or detected by the command.
** Syntax:
*** {{cmd|stats entity <selector> <mode>}}
*** {{cmd|stats block [x] [y] [z] <mode>}}
*** Alternative and more useful way of interacting with the <code>CommandStats</code> tag.
**** After the <code>mode</code> there are currently 5 possible stats that can be updated: <code>SuccessCount</code>, <code>AffectedBlocks</code>, <code>AffectedEntities</code>, <code>AffectedItems</code> and <code>QueryResult</code>.
***** Example: {{cmd|stats entity @a set AffectedBlocks @a Test}} Updates a scoreboard objective named 'Test' for all players whenever a command is performed relative to them. The objective updates by the number of blocks affected by the command. Since the stat was set to <code>AffectedBlocks</code>, this means that if the command is {{cmd|fill}}, it updates the objective for whoever is running the command (@a) by the number of blocks filled.
* {{cmd|worldborder}}
** {{cmd|worldborder <set,add,center,damage,warning,get>}}
*** {{cmd|worldborder set <sizeInBlocks> <timeInSeconds>}}
**** The first argument sets the size of the border (both the width and depth) in blocks, and the second sets the speed of the border when it expands or shrinks.
**** The shape of the border can be only a square.
*** {{cmd|worldborder add <sizeInBlocks> <timeInSeconds>}}
**** Adds blocks to the current size of the world border. It can use negative numbers to subtract to the size of the border.
*** {{cmd|worldborder center <x> <z>}}
**** Sets the center of where the border is placed.
*** {{cmd|worldborder damage <buffer{{!}}amount>}}
**** The amount parameter customizes the damage rate, while outside the border.
**** The buffer parameter customizes the amount of blocks the player can go outside of the border, before starting to take damage.
*** {{cmd|worldborder warning <time{{!}}distance>}}
**** Allows the player to customize how far the player has to be from the border, and/or the amount of time a shrinking border would take to reach the player, before it starts showing the warning.
*** {{cmd|worldborder get}}
**** Tells the player running the command, the current width of the world border in the chat.
* {{cmd|title}}
** Can make text display on the player screen, in the form of a title and/or subtitle using JSON.
** {{cmd|title @a title <raw json message>}}
*** Sets the text of the title, and starts showing both the title and the subtitle (when it has been set).
** {{cmd|title @a subtitle <raw json message>}}
*** Sets the text of the subtitle (optional).
** {{cmd|title @a times <fadeIn> <stay> <fadeOut>}}
*** Sets the fade in, fade out and stay in time for the title and subtitle. This is in game ticks (1/20th of a second).
** {{cmd|title @a clear}}
*** Removes the titles and subtitles off the screen immediately.
** {{cmd|title @a reset}}
*** Resets all time parameters to defaults (specific).
* {{cmd|particle}}
** Spawns a certain number of specific particles in a given area with a specified force vector.
** Syntax: {{cmd|particle <name> <x> <y> <z> <xd> <yd> <zd> <speed> [count] [force]}}.
** Example: {{cmd|1=particle lava ~ ~1 ~ 1 1 1 0.5 50 normal @e[type=Chicken]}} Creates 50 lava popping particles, centered one block above the block/entity running the command, spreading around a radius of 1 block, with a speed of 0.5, relative to all chickens in that world.
** The <code>force</code> argument can be set to <code>force</code> to display particles, even if a player has their 'Particles' toggle set to Minimal or Decreased.
** List of particles: <code>hugeexplosion</code>, <code>largeexplode</code>, <code>fireworksSpark</code>, <code>bubble</code>, <code>suspended</code>, <code>depthsuspend</code>, <code>townaura</code>, <code>crit</code>, <code>magicCrit</code>, <code>smoke</code>, <code>mobSpell</code>, <code>mobSpellAmbient</code>, <code>spell</code>, <code>instantSpell</code>, <code>witchMagic</code>, <code>note</code>, <code>portal</code>, <code>enchantmenttable</code>, <code>explode</code>, <code>flame</code>, <code>lava</code>, <code>footstep</code>, <code>splash</code>, <code>wake</code>, <code>largesmoke</code>, <code>cloud</code>, <code>reddust</code>, <code>snowballpoof</code>, <code>dripWater</code>, <code>dripLava</code>, <code>snowshovel</code>, <code>slime</code>, <code>heart</code>, <code>angryVillager</code>, <code>happyVillager</code>, <code>barrier</code>, <code>iconcrack_(ID)</code>, <code>blockcrack_(ID)</code>, <code>blockdust_(ID)_(DATA)</code>, <code>droplet</code>, <code>take</code>, <code>mobappearance</code>.
'''[[Commands#gamerule|Gamerules]]'''
* <code>logAdminCommands</code>
** Prevents command block output from being stored in chat logs. In multiplayer it also prevents player-initiated commands from being stored. Unrelated to ''commandBlockOutput'', which is output into the visible chat.
* <code>sendCommandFeedback</code>
** If set to false, player-run commands do not show a message.
* <code>showDeathMessages</code>
** If false, prevents death messages like "[player] fell out of the world" from appearing in the chat.
* <code>reducedDebugInfo</code>
** This enable/disable reduced information on the F3 [[debug screen]], like in video settings.
*** Set to 1, overrides the 'reduced debug info' setting in clients.
* <code>randomTickSpeed [value]</code>
** Controls how often a random tick occurs
*** Random ticks influence the next things: pigmen spawning from portals, all plant growth, leaf decay, fire spread, ice melting, grass/mycelium spread and farmland hydration.
** If set to 0, random ticks never occur.
* The ability to create custom gamerule variables.<ref>{{reddit|2aw5nh/new_queryresults_and_gamerule_variables}}</ref>
** These are fake gamerules which don't affect gameplay by themselves, but can be used with {{cmd|stats}} with the new <code>QueryResults</code> argument, to update a scoreboard objective based on the value of that gamerule.
** Declare using: {{cmd|gamerule <newRuleName> <value>}}.
** Access using: {{cmd|gamerule <newRuleName>}}.

'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* New objective criteria for team-specific kills, e.g.: <code>teamkill.red, killedByTeam.blue</code>.
* New objective criteria <code>trigger</code>.
** Acts like the <code>dummy</code> criteria.
** Can be interacted with using the {{cmd|trigger}} command.
** Mostly for use with {{cmd|tellraw}}.
* The ability to iterate over every scoreboard player with <code>*</code>.
** This also affects players who are offline.
* Fake players can be created when run in a command block.
** They exist only through the distinct scoreboard operations and functions, and are merely virtual within the context of the gameplay.
** They do not bring the player count up on servers and do not appear on any player listing.
** Fake players with a name starting with <code>#</code>, never appears on the scoreboard sidebar.
* New {{cmd|scoreboard}} subcommands: {{cmd|scoreboard reset}}, {{cmd|scoreboard operation}}, {{cmd|scoreboard test}} and {{cmd|scoreboard enable}}.
** The <code>reset</code> subcommand can reset all objectives for a player or reset a player's objectives one by one.
*** Example: {{cmd|scoreboard players reset @a anObjective}} Resets the scores of an objective named anObjective for all players in the world.
** The <code>operation</code> subcommand can apply arithmetic operation to and between scores (+ – * / % < > =) and therefore accumulate player scores.
*** Example: {{cmd|1=scoreboard players operation #teamscores redScore += @a[team=red] blueKills}} Adds every red player's count of kills on blue to the red team's score of kills.
*** Can be tested with a comparator to see if two scores are greater than, smaller than or equal to each other.
** The <code>test</code> subcommand can be used to test, if a scoreboard value is between a min and a max value.
*** Example: {{cmd|scoreboard players test #global anObjective 12 19}} Checks whether the global score of the given objective is between 12 and 19, inclusive.
** The <code>enable</code> subcommand can be used to enable a <code>trigger</code> objective.
*** Example: {{cmd|scoreboard players enable Trigger_a}} Enables a <code>trigger</code> named Trigger_a.
* Different teams can have multiple objectives displayed in the sidebar.
** Example: {{cmd|scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar.team.yellow anotherObjective}} This refers to the team color, not the team name.
* Testing for scores also works in <code>@e</code> entity selector.
* Added scoreboard team property to disable name tag visibility: {{cmd|scoreboard teams option <name> nametagVisibility}} with options <code>hideForOtherTeam</code>, <code>hideForOwnTeam</code>, <code>never</code> and <code>always</code> (default).
* Added scoreboard team property to disable death messages: {{cmd|scoreboard teams option <name> deathMessageVisibility}} with the options: <code>never</code>, <code>hideForOtherTeams</code>, <code>hideForOwnTeam</code> and <code>always</code> (default).
* Command {{cmd|scoreboard players}} can now filter by NBT data.

'''NBT format'''
* <code>BlockEntityTag</code>
** [[Block entities]] item form can hold custom NBT tags that are merged to the specified block entity when they're placed.
** Example: {{cmd|give @p command_block 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Command:"setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:diamond_block"<nowiki>}}</nowiki>}} Gives a command block that, when placed, automatically has the command {{cmd|setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:diamond_block}} set.
* <code>Lock</code>
** A way to prevent containers from being opened by players outside of Creative.
*** Locked containers can be opened only by clicking while holding any [[item]] renamed to the given string (like a password).
**** The item is not removed on use.
** Containers can be unlocked by clearing the string from the tag.
* <code>CanDestroy</code>
** Mostly for use in adventure mode.
** Items with this tag display the names of the blocks that they can destroy in the item tooltip.
** Example: {{cmd|give @p minecraft:diamond_shovel 1 0 {CanDestroy:["minecraft:sand","minecraft:grass"]} }} Gives a diamond shovel that can break only grass and sand.
** If an invalid item name is put in, it displays as "missingno" under the "Can Break" list.
* <code>CanPlaceOn</code>
** Allows placing of certain blocks against other blocks in adventure mode.
** Example: {{cmd|give @p minecraft:stone 16 0 {CanPlaceOn:["minecraft:diamond_block"]} }} Gives a block of stone that can be placed only on diamond blocks.
** If an invalid item name is put in, it displays as "missingno" under the "Can Be Placed On" list.
* <code>PickupDelay</code>
** The number of ticks before an item entity can be picked up.
** Set to 32767 for items that can't be picked up.
* <code>generation</code>
** Defines whether a [[written book]] is an ''Original'' a ''Copy of Original'' or a ''Copy of a Copy''.
* <code>HideFlags</code>
** Allows hiding of certain parts of the tooltip.
** Bit field determining which parts of the tooltip to hide on an item. 1 for <code>ench</code>, 2 for <code>AttributeModifiers</code>, 4 for <code>Unbreakable</code>, 8 for <code>CanDestroy</code>, 16 for <code>CanPlaceOn</code> and 32 for various other information (including potion effects, <code>StoredEnchantments</code>, written book <code>generation</code> and <code>author</code>, <code>Explosion</code> and <code>Fireworks</code>).
** Examples: Setting the bit field to 3 would hide both <code>ench</code> and <code>AttributeModifiers</code> tags, and setting it to 63 would hide every tag.
* <code>SelectedItem</code>
** Contains the item data of the item currently held in the player's hand.
** Added to compact the process of testing if a player is holding a specific item.
*** Previous method required nine commands (one per slot in the hotbar); now requires only one command.
* <code>NoAI</code>
** Entities without AI do not attack players, move or rotate on their own, and do not despawn.
** They also do not respond to gravity or collision with other mobs, but can still take damage, die, be caught on fire, and ride other entities.
** Setting to 1 disables an entity's AI.
* <code>rewardExp</code>
** Controls villagers giving [[xp]] for [[trading]].
** Set to 1 for xp or 0 for no xp.
* <code>ShowParticles</code>
** Option to show or hide all particles for a potion effect, as opposed to the <code>Ambient</code> tag, which show fewer particles.
** Set to 1 to show, 0 to hide.
* <code>Silent</code>
** Determines whether sound is produced by an entity, such as idle and hurt sounds.
** Setting to 1 disables sound effects.
* <code>CommandStats</code>
** Allows a [[command block]] or [[sign]] to increase a certain score in the [[scoreboard]] when it runs successfully.
*** The command increases the score based on the number of items/blocks/entities/successes.
*** For example, a command block with this tag running a command which affects items (e.g. <code>/give</code>) causes it to update the score based on the number of items given.
** Syntax: <code>{CommandStats:{AffectedItemsName:"playername", AffectedItemsObjective:"objective", AffectedBlocksName:"playername", AffectedBlocksObjective:"objective", AffectedEntitiesName:"playername", AffectedEntitiesObjective:"objective", SuccessCountName:"playername", SuccessCountObjective:"objective"}}</code>.

** Water particles appear around the sponge when this happens.
* Sponge destroys water blocks from 5 blocks away in a kind of sphere.
* Sponge soaks up water, only when some water is touching it.

'''[[Door]]'''
* Stack to 64.
* The crafting recipe for doors gives three doors instead of one.
* Door item textures were given more detail, to be consistent with the item textures of the new doors.
** The above changes apply to both oak doors and iron doors.

** Creepers, skeletons, wither skeletons and zombies drop their heads when killed by charged creepers. Wither skeletons continue to have heads as [[rare drop]]s.
** Charged creeper explosions do not yield more than one mob head, regardless of how many mobs were killed by it.
* Skulls worn on heads are bigger, so the 2nd skin layer doesn't render outside.
* Player heads now have a 3D item model.
* Player/mob heads, both in inventories and held by mobs/players, now display the actual head skin/texture (including the second skin layer of player skins).
** Placed player heads also render the 2nd skin layer.

'''[[Monster spawner]]'''

** When a baby villager is born, both parents lose their willingness.
** Villagers become willing to breed by consuming food: 3 [[bread]] or 12 [[potato]]es or 12 [[carrot]]s.
** Finding out a villager's willingness in Survival is achieved by counting the amount of [[experience]] given when trading:
*** Normal trading yields 3–6 experience points.
*** Trading that makes the villager willing yields 8–11 experience points.
* Changes to the [[Villager (old)#Profession and careers|farmer]] (profession) villager AI:
** Harvest, collect and replant grown [[potato]], [[carrot]] & [[wheat]] crops.
** Craft [[wheat]] into [[bread]].

** This does not affect the orientation of the spawned mob.
* Can be spawned using [[dispenser]]s, which places the final block in the appropriate place.
** This does not affect the orientation, either.

'''Zombies, zombie pigmen, skeletons, wither skeletons, other creepers & [[witch]]es'''
* Run away from creepers that are about to explode.

'''Baby animals ([[sheep]], [[pig]], [[cow]], [[chicken]], [[cat]], [[wolf]], [[horse]] & [[rabbit]])'''

'''[[Minecarts with TNT]]'''
* Can be ignited with a Flame enchanted bow.
* Explosions no longer stack linearly.

*** The domain is the amount of minecarts and the range is the explosion strength.
*** This puts a hard limit on the possible explosion strength.

'''[[Item frame]]s'''
* Can be seen from further away.
* Items in item frames can now face eight different directions, instead of just four.
* As long as the frame remains placed, it remembers the orientation of the last item it held and uses that orientation for the next item it holds.
* Can give off a signal detected by [[comparator]]s, based on the direction the present item is facing.
** Signal strength is as follows: 0: empty; 1: item; 2: item rotated once; 3: item rotated twice; ...; 8: item rotated 7 times.
** The signal is independent of the specific item inside.

'''[[Painting]]s & item frames'''
* Improved position handling of both.

'''[[World boundary]] & [[World border|border]]'''
* The new world border is generated at the world boundary.
** There is now literally nothing beyond the world boundary.
* The default world border is an animated texture, rather than an invisible [[bedrock]] barrier.
** It's set at a diameter of 60 million blocks, for both the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]].
* The {{cmd|worldborder}} command allows the player to customize various aspects of the world border:
** Its size, center, damage, animation time and warning time and distance.
** When the border changes size, it does it by a shrinking or expanding animation of constant speed.
*** While the border may appear to occupy a fraction of a block, it is defined only on integer steps.
* Players can't pass through the world border from the inside while it's stationary.
** Players pass through the border if it shrinks past them.
* Players on the outside of the world border that are not in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode, take damage.
** It is always possible for players to enter the world border from the outside.
* Aside from the above, it is possible to freely fly/walk around.
** [[Mob]]s and [[item entities]] are unaffected while outside.
* When the player gets within a certain distance of the border, a red-aura-like warning activates.
** Visible only on Fancy graphics.
** Outside the border the warning is always at full strength.
** Inside the border the warning gradually gets stronger as the player approaches the border or viceversa.
*** If the border is stationary, the warning is first seen as the player passes the specified warning distance.
**** The default is 5 blocks from the player's location.
*** If the border is shrinking quickly enough, the warning is first visible at the specified warning time.
**** The default is 15 seconds from the player's location.
* The border extends infinitely in the vertical axis; below bedrock and beyond the build limit.
** It does not render beyond certain heights, like below bedrock.
* The width and length of the border are always the same with respect to each other (like a square).
* It cannot be removed from any world, since it can only be reduced to a 1×1 square.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Now costs from 1 to 3 pieces of [[lapis lazuli]] as well as [[XP]].
** The XP cost is 1–3 levels – the same number as the lapis lazuli the player spend.
* The player still needs the same minimum total levels to unlock it.
* The actual enchantment calculations are the same.
* One and only one of the possible enchantments are displayed in the tooltip.
* The enchantments the player would get on a specific kind of [[tool]] do not change until the enchantment happens.

* Looting now gives an extra 1% chance of getting rare loot per level.

'''[[Anvil]] repairing'''
* Costs reduced to balance out with the new enchanting system.
* Renaming items costs only 1 level.
* Repairing cost now increases exponentially (1, 2, 4, 8...).

'''Villager [[trading]]'''
* Villagers of specific [[Villager (old)#Professions and careers|professions]] (colored clothes) have distinct careers (see above).
* Existing villagers keep already unlocked trades.
* Villagers start out with 2–4 trades unlocked.
* Trading gives [[experience]] to the player.
* The disabled trade arrow has a descriptive tooltip.
* Villagers of the same career have the same trades, but they differ in price/item amount.
* Villagers can level up, offering more trades per level.
* Notable changes in trades:
** Villagers no longer buy cooked fish and no longer sell melons, steak or flint and steel.
** The only pieces of armor that are still sold are chainmail armor, iron helmets and chestplates, enchanted diamond chestplates, leather pants and enchanted leather chestplates.
** The only tools still obtainable from villagers are iron axes, iron shovels, iron pickaxes, enchanted iron swords, diamond pickaxes, diamond swords and diamond axes.
* Notable new trades:

** This does not break iron farms, but change them enough to make them "practically pointless".<ref>{{tweet|_grum|426299865673777152|well little enough to make them practically pointless.|January 23, 2014}}</ref>

'''[[Health]] bar'''
* Has a new animation for [[damage]], that shows how many hearts the player just lost.

* New radius value usable in target selectors, based on the block center.
** A radius of 0 works for exact block positions.
*** The command applies at exactly the center of the respective block, rather than at a corner as previously.
* New selector parameters to detect entity rotations, with rxm = x-rotation minimum, rx = x-rotation maximum, rym = y-rotation minimum and ry = y-rotation maximum.
** Example: <code>@a[rxm=-15,rx=15,rym=-45,ry=45], /say @a[rx=30], don't look down!</code>.

'''[[Commands]]'''
* {{key|tab}} completing coordinate arguments fill in the coordinates of the block that the player is looking at.
* {{cmd|effect}}

* Added a new default skin: Alex.<ref>[https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/979200-minecraft-skins][https://web.archive.org/web/20140910123314/https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/979200-minecraft-skins Minecraft skins] - Mojang</ref>
** Alex's model is that of Steve, but with 3-pixel wide arms instead of 4.
** A choice to select between the Alex and Steve player models on minecraft.net/profile was added shortly after the update.<ref>{{tweet|MojangSupport|511889676227989504|Slim-armed skins are now available to all! Visit http://minecraft.net/profile to make changes, or  https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/979200-minecraft-skins for help! ^MW|September 16, 2014}}</ref>
** If the player doesn't have a custom skin yet, they are randomly assigned a Steve or Alex skin/model based on the random user ID.
*** Skins designed for a specific player model do not automatically translate well to another model.
* Right and left arms and legs are editable independently.
** Uses a modified ''steve.png'' file, with new layout and new dimensions.
*** Dimensions for the file are now 64×64.
* Overlays now include the whole body.
** The player can toggle the visibility of each overlay separately in the options menu.

* Entities now have tooltips in certain chat instances when hovered over.
** These appear when hovered over an entity's name in chat (e.g. the success message for {{cmd|kill}}).
** Shows the name of the entity (e.g. Bob), the Id of the entity (e.g. Creeper (50)) and the entity UUID.
** {{key|Shift}}+{{key|Left click}} while hovering over the entity's name inserts its UUID into the chat bar. They also work in commands.
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|D}} clears the chat history (including previously typed commands).

'''UUID'''
* All player lists are converted to the UUID-based system automatically.
** Other features such as pet ownership now follow the same system.
** This is part of the requirements for the [[Plugin API]].

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Text now has a gray and translucent background.
* Now displays render distance, sections being rendered currently, sections being updated currently, an ''aB'' value for unknown reasons, version id, whether the client is modded, keywords for when ''Clouds''/''VBOs''/''VSync'' are enabled, the display resolution and vendor, the graphics card model and vendor and the local [[wikipedia:OpenGL|OpenGL]] and Java versions.
* Player coordinates displays which block the feet are in.
** Before it was at the head level.
* When looking at a block, its coordinates, block id and properties are displayed.
** Block states of the block being looked at are displayed on the F3 menu.
* The ''Facing:'' line now indicates in which axis-based direction the player is looking at on the horizontal plane.
** For example: "Toward positive Z".
* The crosshair turns into 3 short, colored lines indicating the positive direction of the 3 axis: "x-red", "y-green", "z-blue'".
* ''Light'' is now the light level at the feet.
** Before it was the at the head level.
* Player rotation is now displayed for the vertical angle, as well as the horizontal one.
* Day counter added.
** Increases by 1 every dawn.
** Is independent of any [[statistic]].
* Now displays difficulty.
** Peaceful–0.00, Easy–0.75, Normal–1.50, Hard–2.25.

'''F3 hotkeys'''
* Debug tooltips now show how many NBT tags an item has.
* When debug tooltips are enabled, items show their name id.
* When debug tooltips are enabled, some instances of usernames and entities in the chat shows the entity's UUID when hovered on.
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|D}} can now be used to clear the chat log.
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|S}} or {{key|F3}} + {{key|T}} reloads block models.
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|B}} entity hitboxes now also display entity eye level in red, and which direction entities are looking at in blue.
* {{key|F3}} + {{key|H}} tooltips now show how many NBT tags an item has.

'''Block [[Java Edition pre-flattening data values|IDs]]'''
* Instances of blocks/items referenced in commands can now be named IDs.
** Example: <code>id:"minecraft:stone"</code>.
** In scoreboards, the format is <code>minecraft.block.stone</code>.
** Old numerical IDs are still supported, but will eventually be phased out.
*** This is part of the requirements for the [[Plugin API]].

'''Block handling'''
* Now uses block states internally instead of metadata.
** Metadata will still be used for a while.
* Metadata no longer needs to be calculated out of the 4-bit data value.
** Instead the values of specified properties can now be easily gotten and set.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Now can:
** Set the default resource pack handling: prompt, enabled or disabled.
** Customize network compression in <code>server.properties</code> using <code>network-compression-threshold</code>: <code>0</code>to compress everything, or <code>-1</code> to compress nothing.
** Optionally send a hash for clients to verify resource packs, using <code>resource-pack-hash</code> in <code>server.properties</code>: Should be a 40 character hexadecimal string; otherwise it is used as a unique id.
** Configure how long a tick may take before shutting down using <code>max-tick-time</code> in <code>server.properties</code>.
** Configure the maximum world size (which overrides {{cmd|worldborder}}) using <code>max-world-size</code> in <code>server.properties</code>.
** Send messages to be displayed on the action bar.

'''Rendering & performance'''
* Each [[dimension]] ([[Overworld]], [[Nether]], [[End]]) runs on separate threads.
** This makes it so that the performance in one dimension, is independent of the performance in all others.
* [[Chunk]] rendering and chunk rebuilds are now multi-threaded to speed them up.
* [[Mob]] pathfinding is now multi-threaded, to alleviate previous slow-downs associated with it.
* Ore generation is now more than twice as fast.{{citation needed}}
* Only transparent blocks can render as transparent.
** This makes all x-ray texture packs useless.
* Rewrote chunk sorting and block rendering.
* Better visibility culling.
** Inherited from the [[Pocket Edition]].
** Now it renders only those blocks in view of the player instead of the entire render distance radius.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Statistics for items/blocks are now be referenced per name, instead of ID.

* The animation in [[first-person view]], where an item moves up and down is no tied to held item being changed instead of selected hotbar slot change.
** This causes the animation to longer play when switching between 2 identical items by changing the selected [[hotbar]] slot
** This causes the animation to play when the data of the held item is changed in any way, such as dropping it, which changes the count or enchanting it with the [[Commands/enchant|/enchant]] command

== Trivia ==
* At the time, this was the longest development to a major update in the history of ''Minecraft'', with the first snapshot coming out on January 9, 2014, 236 days before the full release.
** The previous longest was [[Java Edition 1.3.1|1.3.1]], with 111 days from the first snapshot to the final release – less than half of 1.8's.
* At the time, this update had the most development snapshots of any major update so far, at 52 snapshots.
** The update with the most snapshots previous to this was also 1.3.1, with 19 snapshots, slightly more than one-third of 1.8's snapshot count.
** [[Java Edition 1.9|1.9]] broke the record with slightly more snapshots, with 56.
* Upon the release of 1.8, a change with how skins worked has caused skins that were changed after the release of 1.8 to not display on the [[player]] in versions [[Java Edition 1.2.5|1.2.5]] and prior.
* 1.8 was the only major update to {{JE}} released in 2014.
* With 426 fixes, 1.8 has the second most bug fixes of any update, beaten only by [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]].
* 1.8 was the last non-development version of Java Edition released before Mojang Studios' acquisition by Microsoft.
* 1.8's cycle held the record for the most further revisions out of any ''[[Java Edition]]'' full release update cycle, with 9 revisions, and therefore 10 total updates. This was only beaten 11 years later by the 1.21 update cycle upon the release of [[Java Edition 1.21.10|1.21.10]].
