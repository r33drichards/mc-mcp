'''Zeus''' is the most powerful character in the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]''. The brother of Poseidon, he too poses as a god of the [[Greek Isles]], but is open about it being a mere role.

== Appearance ==
Zeus has a gold crown with a light green or blue gemstone on the front, blue eyes, gray hair and beard, light skin, a white colored robe with a gold or yellow belt, a purple sash, what appear to be some kind of gold bracelets and shoulder pads, purple, open-toed sandals, and seemingly no pants. He holds a lightning bolt.

== Personality ==
Unlike his [[Poseidon|brother]], Zeus is shown to be very kind, never once kidnapping anyone. While he shares his hyperfixation with Greek mythology, he is blunt and honest about the fact it’s mere roleplay. He serves a much more favorable role in the story, helping resolve the conflict and asking for help in other lands. However, he does appear somewhat lazy, prioritizing catching up on the lore of [[CommuniKate]]’s TV show over actually intervening with the situation.

== Biography == 
Before the series began, Zeus supposedly founded the Greek Isles, and then scattered the enchanted eyes of Ender across the islands and had the Greek myths guard them.

At the end of season two, after Poseidon claimed the eyes with the help of the heroes, Zeus arrived on a griffin. He took the enchanted eyes of ender and then persuades the heroes to help him.

== Relationships == 
=== Poseidon ===
Despite the fact that Zeus and Poseidon are brothers, they have a rather bad relationship, since Zeus, knowing that his brother could be dangerous, hid the enchanted eyes of Ender from him, and therefore Poseidon holds a grudge against him.
=== Theseus ===
It is not shown in the series, but most likely Zeus and Theseus have a good relationship, which is what an uncle and nephew should have.

== Trivia ==
* Zeus is based on the "Zeus" skin in the Greek Mythology [[Mash-up pack]].
