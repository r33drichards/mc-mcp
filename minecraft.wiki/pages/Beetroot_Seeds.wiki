'''Beetroot seeds''' are items that can be used to plant beetroot crops.

'''Beetroot crops''' are planted in [[farmland]] and used to grow [[beetroot]] and beetroot seeds.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Harvesting fully-grown beetroot yields from 1 to 4 seeds per crop harvested ({{frac|2|5|7}} seeds per crop harvested on average). The [[Fortune]] enchantment can be used to improve the drop rate.
{{breaking row|Beetroots|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[Village]] farm plots have a chance of being beetroots. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:
{| class="wikitable"
! Village style !! Chance
|-
| {{EnvSprite|desert-village}} Desert || 20%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|plains-village}} Plains || 5%
|}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|beetroot-seeds}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell beetroot seeds for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
=== Farming ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Crop farming|title1=Crop farming}}

Beetroot seeds can be planted on [[farmland]] to create a plant that grows through 4 [[Block tick|stages]] of growth. The seeds require a [[light level]] of 8 or greater to plant{{only|java}} and 9 or greater to grow. {{IN|bedrock}} they can be planted at any light level, but need a [[Light#Internal light level|internal light level]] of 9 to grow. When fully grown, the plant can be broken to harvest beetroot seeds and [[beetroot]]s.

While beetroot crops have only four growth stages compared to eight for [[wheat]], [[carrot]]s and [[potato]]es, each growth tick has a {{frac|1|3}} chance of not advancing the growth stage and therefore beetroot grows slightly faster than other crops.

Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is [[hydrated]]. One application of [[bone meal]] has a 75% chance of advancing growth by one stage. This is less effective than for other crops: an average of {{frac|5|1|3}} are needed to fully grow beetroot compared to {{frac|2|2|7}} for other crops.

Crops break if pushed by a [[piston]] or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

=== Breeding ===
Like other [[seeds]], beetroot seeds can be used to breed [[chicken]]s, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

=== Taming ===
Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to tame [[parrot]]s.

=== Composting ===
Placing beetroot seeds into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
