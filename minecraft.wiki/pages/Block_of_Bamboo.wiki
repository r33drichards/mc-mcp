A '''block of bamboo''' is a [[log]]-like block made of [[bamboo]] that can be used to craft [[Planks#Bamboo|bamboo planks]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A block of bamboo can be broken by hand, but using an [[axe]] speeds up the process.

|description = Cannot be crafted back into 9 bamboo.

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage|Block of Bamboo}}

=== Stripping ===
{{control|Using}} an [[axe]] on a block of bamboo turns it into a [[block of stripped bamboo]].

=== Fuel ===
Blocks of bamboo can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, [[smelting]] 1.5 [[item]]s per [[block]].

The efficiency of using bamboo as fuel depends on how it is crafted. 9 bamboo can smelt 2.25 items, whereas a block can smelt only 1.5 items. However, the block can be crafted into 2 bamboo planks, which together can smelt 3 items.

Unlike [[log]]s, blocks of bamboo cannot be smelted into [[charcoal]].<ref>{{bug|MC-257428||Bamboo blocks and stripped bamboo blocks cannot be processed into charcoal|WAI}}</ref>

=== Note blocks ===
Block of bamboo can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
