''Minecraft'' has multiple custom [[w:Filename extension|file extensions]] used to launch the game in specific ways, import packs, or store data.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
* {{cd|[[mcmeta|.mcmeta]]}}: Used to define metadata of a [[resource pack]], [[data pack]], or a [[texture]].
* {{cd|[[Anvil file format|.mca]]}}: Used to store region data of a world.
* {{cd|[[Region file format|.mcr]]}}: Previously used to store region data of a world from [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]] to [[Java Edition 1.1|1.1]].

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
These file extensions are essentially identical to {{cd|.zip}} files and can be converted from or to such a file. However, most of these files allow to launch ''Minecraft'' or ''Minecraft Preview'', which will automatically import the file in the dedicated directory.
* {{cd|.mcaddon}}: Contains other ''Minecraft'' packs to import simultaneously as part of an [[add-on]].
* {{cd|.mceditoraddon}}: Used import an Editor [[add-on]] in ''[[Bedrock Editor]]''.
* {{cd|.mcfunction}}: A [[Function (Bedrock Edition)|function]] containing ''Minecraft'' commands. Must be placed inside a [[behavior pack]].
* {{cd|.mcpack}}: Used to import a [[resource pack]], [[behavior pack]], or [[skin pack]].
* {{cd|.mcperf}}{{info needed}}
* {{cd|.mcproject}}: Used to import a [[project]] in ''Bedrock Editor''.
* {{cd|.mcshortcut}}: Used to open ''Minecraft'' directly in a world or server with the [[Quick Play]] feature.
* {{cd|.mcstructure}}: Used to save a [[Structure_Block#Save|structure]] with [[structure blocks]]. Can be used inside a [[behavior pack]].
* {{cd|.mctemplate}}: Used import a [[world template]].
