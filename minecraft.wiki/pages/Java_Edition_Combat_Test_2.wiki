'''Combat Test 2''' is the second experimental version of a future combat update.<ref>{{reddit|cqnp5b||Update: Custom Java Edition snapshot to test new combat mechanics (version 2)|jeb_|August 15, 2019}}</ref> Although it is a version for a future major release, this combat experiment is a [[wikipedia:Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[Java Edition 1.14.4|1.14.4]]. This version was released only on {{w|Reddit}}, so it does not appear in the [[launcher]] or in any [[Minecraft.net]] blog post.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Combat]]'''
* Attacking while crouching now disables the [[shield]] during the attack.
** Shield is reenabled after the [[weapon]] has reached 200% charge.
* Removed auto-attacking by holding the {{ctrl|attack}} button.<ref group="note">Hold to auto-attack is always enabled for controller and touch controls.</ref>
* Weapon reach is always active and increased by half a block during a special attack.

'''[[HUD]]'''
* The hotbar attack indicator now only appears after the attack is 100% recharged, showing the progress of reaching 200% charge instead.

=== Items ===
<!-- Attack damage, speed, and reach already tested for all other tools -->
[[File:Shield JE2 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Shield]]s'''
* Now protect against critical attacks again.

{{Animate|Wooden Sword JE2 BE2.png;Stone Sword JE2 BE2.png;Iron Sword JE2 BE2.png;Golden Sword JE3 BE2.png;Diamond Sword JE2 BE2.png|32px}} '''[[Sword]]s'''
* Decreased the attack speed of all swords to 2.5.

[[File:Trident (item).png|width=32x32]] '''[[Trident]]s'''
* Increased [[damage]] to {{hp|8}}.

== Fixes ==
'''From the previous development version'''
* Weapon cooldowns now no longer apply to [[player]]s in [[Creative]] mode.
* Fixed scale of the hotbar attack indicator.</onlyinclude>
