'''19w13b''' is the thirtieth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on March 29, 2019<ref name=19w13b>{{snap|19w13b|March 29, 2019}}</ref>, which revamps the [[trading]] interface.

19w13b was reuploaded for unknown reasons with no changes except for a later build time.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bell]]s'''
* Hitting a bell during a [[raid]] applies the [[Glowing]] effect to raiding illagers within 32 blocks of it.
* A new sound for ringing bells during raids has been added.

'''[[Blocks of quartz]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Block of Quartz JE2.png|32px]] to [[File:Block of Quartz JE3 BE2.png|32px]].

'''[[Stonecutter]]s'''
* Added recipe for [[chiseled stone bricks]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Revamped trading UI.
** Available trades are listed in a left sidebar, similar to {{BE}}. 
** When [[player]]s have the required materials, clicking on one of the trades puts the items into the slots automatically.

=== General ===
'''Entity tags'''
* Added new <code>raiders</code> tag for all [[illager]]s including [[witch]]es and [[illusioner]]s (despite them being unused).
