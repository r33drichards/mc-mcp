A '''written book''' is a [[book and quill]] that has been signed, which prevents its text from being edited and allows copies of it to be [[crafted]]. It can also be displayed on a [[lectern]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Signing a book and quill ===
Written books can be obtained by signing a [[book and quill]]. After it has been signed, it cannot be edited again. The label does not say "Written Book", but whatever the [[player]] titles it. The title appears on the top line of the label, and "by <''player''>" (the player's username) on the bottom. {{IN|bedrock}}, this is customizable without [[commands]].

=== Copying ===
A signed written book can be be copied using a [[crafting table]]. Books have four generations: "Original", "Copy of Original", "Copy of Copy", and "Tattered". Only books of the generations "Original" and "Copy of Original" may be copied, creating the "Copy of Original" and "Copy of Copy" generations respectively. Books of the generation "Copy of Copy" may not be copied. The "Tattered" generation is unused in normal gameplay.

== Usage ==
Written books can be opened by pressing the {{control|use}} control (or holding down on the touchscreen {{in|bedrock}}), and display a GUI allowing the [[player]] to read it or turn the page.

The contents of a book are an extra set of data attached to the item. This means that when a book is destroyed, its contents are lost with it.

=== Lecterns ===
Written books can be placed on an empty [[lectern]].

The lectern then emits a redstone signal depending on the displayed page in the book. On the last page, the lectern emits a signal strength of 15.

=== Chiseled bookshelf ===
{{control|Use|text=Using}} the [[chiseled bookshelf]] while having a written book in the main hand puts the book inside the chiseled bookshelf.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*When written books are obtained with [[commands]] (without the correct [[Player.dat format#Written Books|data tag]]), the label shows "Written Book" and has the text "*Invalid book tag*" when opened. The book is signed and cannot be edited without commands.
*Commands that were added to a written book using serialized JSON objects are executed through the chat system. This means that any command added to a written book can't be longer than 256 characters, which is the maximum chat line limit.
*Within the April Fools' snapshot [[Java Edition 20w14∞]], throwing a written book into a lit [[Nether Portal (block)|nether portal]] creates a portal to one of the 2,147,483,645 new dimensions.
