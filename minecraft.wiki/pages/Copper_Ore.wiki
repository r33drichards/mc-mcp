'''Copper ore''' is an [[ore]] block found underground.

'''Deepslate copper ore''' is the [[deepslate]] variant of copper ore, usually found deeper underground.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Copper ore must be [[Breaking|mine]]d with a [[stone pickaxe]] or better, otherwise it drops nothing.

Breaking copper ore drops 2-5 [[raw copper]], unless mined with a [[Silk Touch]] pickaxe. It is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping up to 20 raw copper, or 7.7 raw copper on average with Fortune III.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
Copper ore can be generated anywhere on the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. Copper ore generate in two batches, the first batch generate anywhere on the overworld biomes except dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 16, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends. The second batch generate only in dripstone caves 16 times per chunks in groups from 0 to 52, in layer -16 to 112, being most common in layers 47 and 48 and less common at the ends.

Copper ore can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. Copper ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate copper ore.

It can also spawn rare [[ore vein]]s above Y=0, mixed with granite and the occasional [[Block of Raw Copper|raw copper blocks]]. In [[dripstone caves]] biomes, copper ore veins are larger on average.

== Usage ==
The primary usage of copper ore is to [[#Breaking|mine]] it for [[raw copper]]. Copper ore does not weather like its block counterpart, though the ore itself shows some [[oxidation]].
