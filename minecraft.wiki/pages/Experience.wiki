'''Experience''' ('''EXP''' or '''XP''' for short) can be gained from defeating [[mob]]s or performing many kinds of other actions. Experience has no direct effect on the player character, but it can be used to enhance their equipment through [[enchanting]], or by using an [[anvil]] to repair, rename, or combine enchantments on equipment. Most sources of experience are produced in the form of '''experience orbs'''. {{IN|java}}, experience gained affects the player's '''score''' on the [[death screen]].

Experience orbs also recover durability on items with [[Mending]] that are being worn or are in-hand.

== Sources ==
Experience can be gained from several different sources. Most sources drop experience in the form of orbs, which can be claimed by any player, while a few methods directly award the player experience upon completing the action.

* From killing most mobs, which drop experience orbs along with any other items.
** A mob does not drop experience orbs unless it dies within five seconds (100 game ticks) of an attack registered as a player hit (including tamed [[wolves]], player thrown fireballs, and TNT). This allows gaining experience orbs from, say, knocking a monster off a cliff, lighting a mob on fire, etc. (fetching the orbs might be another question). The [[player]] can also try to "claim" a burning monster by hitting or shooting it once—even if the blow doesn't kill it, if the mob dies within 5 seconds, it drops experience orbs.
** Mobs killed by [[TNT]] activated by a player using [[flint and steel]] or a flaming arrow drop XP as usual; however, mobs killed by TNT that was activated by fire, [[redstone]], or an explosion that wasn't [[player]] activated does not drop any experience orbs.
** [[Mob]]s drop a random number of experience orbs, which can have different values. However, the total value always remains within the values given below, regardless of [[difficulty]] setting.
** Hostile mobs give more experience orbs than passive ones. Baby animals, [[bat]]s, [[golem]]s, and [[villager]]s give no experience orbs at all. The [[ender dragon]] gives experience orbs totaling 12,000 XP the first time a [[player]] kills it—12 times more than anything else in the game—and 500 XP in subsequent defeats.
*** Some hostile [[mob]]s spawn with weapons, or ''can'' spawn with weapons and/or [[armor]]. These mobs give an extra 1–3 points (randomly) per piece of equipment that they spawned with if the piece is not dropped. Equipment picked up after spawning doesn't count.
** [[Mining]] a [[monster spawner]] block gives 15–43 points of experience orbs.
** Mining a naturally-generated [[creaking heart]] drops 20–24 experience.
** While they do not drop experience orbs normally, baby mobs as well as mobs killed by non-player means are accepted by the [[sculk catalyst]], allowing for experience orbs to be obtained in a more indirect way.
* From [[mining]] any ore that drops a resource, rather than raw metals or themselves. The experience orbs are produced along with the mineral item(s). If a [[Silk Touch]] pickaxe is used to mine the ore block, the experience is not dropped, but the block can later be placed and mined normally to release the mineral and the experience.
** The ore still produces orbs if destroyed by an explosion, whether or not it was caused by player activated TNT.
* From mining [[sculk]], [[sculk sensor]]s, [[sculk shrieker]]s, and [[sculk catalyst]]s. If a [[Silk Touch]] tool is used to mine it, the experience is not dropped, but it can later be placed and mined normally to release the experience.
* From [[smelting]] any of various items.
** Smelting any ore yields some experience, but normally only [[nether gold ore]] and [[ancient debris]] are worthwhile. For all other ores, [[Smelting#Wasting ores|mining them is better]].
** Moderate amounts are gained by smelting/cooking other materials: food, clay balls or blocks, [[cactus]], wood logs, sand, or cobblestone, cactus giving the most.{{only|Java|short=1}}
** The smelted material must be taken from the furnace through its GUI window. If the player uses a hopper to unload the furnace, it is possible to retrieve all experience produced by the furnace by smelting an extra item and taking it from the GUI. Breaking the furnace drops all stored experience as collectable experience orbs.
* From [[breeding]] animals.
** Orbs are produced where the parents are, along with the baby animal. Breaking [[egg]]s does not give experience.
* From [[fishing]]. 
**The experience is awarded directly upon reeling in the fish, even if the fish itself is not picked up.
* From [[trading]] with villagers.
* A [[bottle o' enchanting]] releases orbs when broken.
* From the {{cmd|experience}} command.
* From disenchanting items in a [[grindstone]].
* From completing a challenge [[advancement]].{{only|Java|short=1}}

Gathering experience points increases the player's experience level by gradually filling a bar on the bottom of the screen until a new level is achieved when the bar is full. When the player dies, they drop experience orbs worth ''7 * current level'' experience points, up to a maximum of 100 points<!-- confirmed from a source --> (enough to reach approximately 7.5 levels), and all of the other experience vanishes. If the gamerule <code>keepInventory</code> is set to true, the experience is kept even if the player dies.

== Experience orbs ==
Most experience sources drop experience in the form of '''experience orbs''', which can then be claimed by any player.

Experience orbs fade between green and yellow colors and float or glide toward the player up to a distance of 7.25 blocks (calculated from the center of player's feet and the center of the experience orb), speeding up as they get nearer to the player. Experience orbs pulled toward a player are slowed by cobwebs. Experience orbs can also be pulled around or away from the player by running water currents.

When collected, experience orbs make a bell-like sound for a split second. Unlike [[item]]s, experience points are picked up gradually: no matter how many orbs are in the range of the player, they are added to the player's experience one at a time (10 orbs/second). In extreme cases, this can result in the player being followed by a swarm of orbs for many seconds. If an experience orb isn't collected within 5 minutes of its appearance, it despawns.

=== Orb sizes ===
Experience orbs vary in value. The general worth of an orb is reflected by its size, with eleven possible sizes corresponding to specific values. The three smallest sizes are the most commonly encountered, as the majority of experience dropped by mobs and blocks is less than ten. Dense experience orbs with values 17 or higher have orange "eyes" or "cores", and are less frequently encountered, most commonly from defeating the [[ender dragon]], [[wither]] and other [[player]]s, disenchanting objects on a [[grindstone]], breaking [[spawners]], and collecting items from high-traffic [[furnace]]s. For performance improvement, experience orbs of the same value can merge into a single entity, but they do not create a higher value orb.

=== Dropping orbs ===

Naturally spawned orbs always have an integer value of 1–11, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, or 2477. Fishing, breeding, and trading drop a single orb with a random value in the appropriate range. Breaking blocks, killing mobs and players, smelting items, and bottles o' enchanting calculate their total experience amount and then split it into the base values of orbs by size (1, 3, 7, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, and 2477). 

Higher values are chosen first, so, for example, a total value of 1000 would be dropped as orbs with values 617, 307, 73, and 3. While the first ender dragon in a world drops 12,000 experience, it is dropped in 10 waves of 1000 and one of 2000, so no orbs of value 2477 are dropped. Such orbs can exist in the world via furnaces that have had a lot of traffic.

Like [[item]]s, experience orbs float when on water. Experience orbs can be destroyed by fire, lava, explosions, and cacti, and can trigger pressure plates and tripwires. Experience orbs can also stop minecarts. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, although mob [[drops]] spawn the instant the final blow is dealt to the mob, experience orbs do not appear until the mob entity disappears and the smoke appears. {{IN|java}}, experience orbs appear in the same spatial and temporal location as loot when an [[entity]] is killed.

=== Negative orbs ===
Orbs with negative values can be created using the {{cmd|summon}} command, either using values below 0 or above 32767 due to 16-bit [[wikipedia:Integer overflow|integer overflow]]. They use the smallest texture of experience orb. 

Negative orbs behave differently from positive orbs, namely that they ''do not'' deduct experience when collected by the player.

They deduct durability from a tool enchanted with [[Mending]], provided the tool is already damaged prior to collection of the orbs.<ref>{{ytl|k-ip4iRccvE}}</ref>

[[File:XP Per Level 14w02a.svg|850px]]

The formulas for figuring out how many experience orbs needed to get to the next level are as follows:

:'''Experience required ='''
::'''2 × ''current_level'' + 7''' (for levels 0–15)
::'''5 × ''current_level'' – 38''' (for levels 16–30)
::'''9 × ''current_level'' – 158''' (for levels 31+)

One can determine how much experience has been collected to reach a level using the equations:
:'''Total experience ='''
::'''''level''<sup>2</sup> + 6 × ''level''''' (at levels 0–16)
::'''2.5 × ''level''<sup>2</sup> – 40.5 × ''level'' + 360''' (at levels 17–31)
::'''4.5 × ''level''<sup>2</sup> – 162.5 × ''level'' + 2220''' (at levels 32+)

Likewise, to get the number of levels from the total experience value, one can utilize the following inverse equations:
:'''Total Levels ='''
::At levels 0-16 (totals 0 to 352): <math>\sqrt{\mathsf{total}+9}-3</math>
::At levels 17–31 (totals 353 to 1507): <math>\frac{81}{10} + \sqrt{\frac{2}{5} \left( \mathsf{total} - \frac{7839}{40} \right)}</math>
::At levels 32+ (totals 1508+): <math>\frac{325}{18} + \sqrt{\frac{2}{9} \left( \mathsf{total} - \frac{54215}{72} \right) }</math>

=== Useful numbers ===
* {{:Calculators/Required experience}}
* Getting from level 0 to level 30 requires 1395 experience.
* Getting from level 27 to level 30 requires 306 experience.
* Killing one large [[slime]] and all the slimes that split from it yield from 12 to 28 experience, with an average of 19.
* Killing a slime of the largest size that can be spawned using the {{cmd|summon}} command and all slimes that split from it yield 448 to 8128 experience, with an average of 3025.
* The maximum level required for using an enchanting table is level 30, while the anvil accepts jobs up to level 39 (in creative mode the anvil limit is removed).
* Level 16 is a quarter of the way to level 30, while level 22 is about halfway there. Level 30, in turn, is halfway to level 39.
* Killing the ender dragon the first time gives approximately 68 XP levels. The ender dragon actually drops 10 waves of orbs worth a total of 1,000 experience points per wave, and another worth a total of 2,000. Taken separately, the smaller waves could take a player from zero to level 26, while the big wave would take a player from zero to level 34. The largest orb dropped has a value of 1237 experience points, and can take a player from zero to level 28 all by itself.
** However, it is practically impossible to collect all of the experience points as some of it will fall into the return portal, requiring you to go to the world origin to collect the remaining experience.
* The maximum XP-level that players can get legitimately {{in|be}} is 24,791.<ref>[https://youtu.be/ZOL468JSy3U YouTube - Max XP level reached in Minecraft]</ref>
* The maximum XP that players can get legitimately {{in|je}} is 238,609,312, and at this level the experience bar disappears, because reaching the next level would require more XP than the 32-bit integer limit (2,147,483,647, which is {{sup|2|31}} - 1). However, it is possible to reach level 2,147,483,647 using commands. In this case, the experience bar may disappear and reappear.<ref>{{bug|MC-3266}}</ref>

== Score ==
{{Redirect|Score|the similar mechanic controlled by [[command]]s|Scoreboard}}
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
[[File:Hardcore Death.png|thumb|right|Example of the score in [[Hardcore]] mode.]]

The score is the number of experience the player has collected since their last death. This number is the total experience the player has collected, rather than the amount of experience they had upon death. When the player dies, the score is displayed on the death screen.

== Sounds ==

[[File:DeathScore&e0.png|thumb]]

* Before [[Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2]], the score on the death screen always read &e0.
** This was caused by an error with coloring the text. In [[Java Edition Classic]] (including the [[Survival Test]] versions that featured the original score system), the '&' character was used to color text, so '&e0' would produce '0' in bright yellow. This was later changed to instead use the '§' character for colored text, but because the death screen hadn't been updated with this, the raw formatting code was shown.

[[File:ExcessiveExperienceOrbs.png|thumb|An example of the excessive amount of experience orbs [[drop]]ped upon [[death]] in [[Beta 1.8]], causing extreme performance drops.]]

The experience level costs were heavily revised in snapshot [[12w22a]] and [[12w23a]], and again in version 1.8. Before these, reaching level 50 (the maximum usable on a single enchantment) required 4625 experience, corresponding to defeating 925 hostile [[mob]]s (assuming the "common" ones.) Afterward, considerably less experience is needed to get into higher levels. Higher levels cost more experience than lower ones, but the levels are still easier to get than in [[Java Edition 1.2.5|1.2.5]]. Now, level 30 is the maximum for [[enchantments]], and that cost is equivalent of 279 "common" enemies, less than 1/3 the old price.

A player dropping excessive experience orbs upon death may cause performance degradation in the game.

== Trivia ==
* It was mentioned by [[Jeb]] in ''[[The World of Minecraft]]'' that he would have preferred the name "'''enchantment orbs'''" even though it is not in the code.<ref>''[[The World of Minecraft]]'', Chapter Four, Taste for Adventure, Food Items</ref>
* If a player kills a mob by firing [[potion]]s out of a [[dispenser]], no experience is dropped.
* Using experience on [[enchanting]] or [[repairing]] does not decrease the [[score]] that is shown upon [[death]].
* If the player gains experience points exceeding 238,609,311, the experience bar and level counter completely disappear from the [[HUD]].<ref>{{bug|MC-79545}}</ref>
* The maximum XP that can be gained from the {{cmd|xp}} command is 2,147,483,647 levels or 2<sup>31</sup>&minus;1, the largest value representable by a 32-bit signed integer and by Java's int type.
* The texture file for experience orbs contains an additional five orb sprites that are all identical to the size 3 sprite.
* The process of dropping orbs by base value prioritizing the highest applicable sizes is an example of the {{W|Change-making problem|change-making problem|newtab=1}}. The coin system is the set of base values of orbs by size. It is the set {1, 3, 7, 17, 37, 73, 149, 307, 617, 1237, 2477}. It is not a canonical coin system.
