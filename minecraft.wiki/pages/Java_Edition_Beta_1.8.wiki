The official trailer for Beta 1.8, made by Hat Films. The footage shown is from an earlier, [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 (preview)|non-public preview build]] given to Hat Films for advertising purposes, and thus has a few differences from public versions. Made before ''Java Edition'''s final release (and way before [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]] existed), the trailer omits "Beta" from the version title.
