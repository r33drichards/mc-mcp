A '''pig''' is a [[passive mob]] found commonly in most grassy [[biome]]s. Adult pigs are a source of [[porkchop]]s and can be ridden using a [[saddle]] and a carrot on a stick. They have three variants based on the [[temperature]] of the biome they [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in.

== Spawning ==
Pigs spawn in the [[Overworld]] in most grassy biomes except for [[snowy plains]], [[meadow]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, and [[pale garden]]s.

{{IN|java}}, pigs spawn in groups of 4 on [[grass block]]s. Individual pigs rarely may spawn on grass after world generation.

{{IN|bedrock}}, pigs spawn in groups of 1 to 3 on grass blocks. 
Individuals regularly spawn on grass after world generation.

Each pig has a 5% chance of spawning as a baby.

Pigs sometimes also spawn in animal pens, stables, and butcher house backyards in [[village]]s upon world generation.

Pigs cannot spawn naturally with a saddle.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Variants === 
{{Redirect|Pig variant|the definition of pig variants in data packs|Mob variant definitions#Pig}}
Pigs have 3 variants: temperate, cold, and warm. This variant is determined by the biome the pig spawns in and does not impact their behavior.

{{Farm animal variants}}

If a pig spawn egg is used in any biome not listed, a temperate pig is spawned.

== Drops ==

=== Breeding ===
Successfully [[breeding]] two adult pigs result in {{xp|1|7}} orbs.

=== On death ===
An adult pig drops:
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Raw Porkchop|notes=not_burn|quantity=1-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Cooked Porkchop|notes=burn|quantity=1-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* A {{ItemLink|saddle}} if saddled.
* {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].

Killing a baby pig yields neither [[item]]s nor [[experience]].

== Behavior ==
Pigs roam the Overworld avoiding hazards and harmful falls. A pig flees for a short time when harmed.

Pigs follow players holding [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[beetroot]]s or [[carrots on sticks]] within a radius of six blocks.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}
Pigs can be bred using [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es or [[beetroot]]s. After breeding, the parents have a cooldown of 5 minutes before they can breed again. Baby pigs mature in 20 minutes and stay near their parents. Feeding them reduces the remaining time to maturity by 10%.

When two different variants of pigs are bred together, the variant of the baby is randomly selected from one of the parents' variants.

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}
[[File:Pigriding.png|thumb|A [[player]] riding a pig with a [[carrot on a stick]] and a [[saddle]].]]
It is possible to ride an adult pig by {{control|using}} a [[saddle]] on it. [[Shears]] can be used on a saddled pig to retrieve the saddle. Baby pigs cannot be saddled nor ridden.

Saddled pigs are controllable with a [[carrot on a stick]]. They travel at a default speed of 2.42&nbsp;blocks/s.

{{Control|Using}} the carrot on a stick causes the pig to enter a boost, at the cost of 7 durability. While boosted, the pig gradually accelerates to its peak speed of 5.2&nbsp;blocks/s (6.24&nbsp;blocks/s with [[Speed]] I and 7.28&nbsp;blocks/s with Speed II) until halfway through the boost, and then decelerates to its default speed by the end of the boost. Specifically, the speed of the pig increases by <math>1+1.15\times \sin(\frac{t}{t_0}\pi)</math> times the original speed, where <math>t</math> is the time already passed since the start of the boost, and <math>t_0</math> is the total duration of the boost. No matter how many ticks the boost lasts, the average speed of pig during a full boost cycle is roughly 4.19 m/s. 

Unlike other Overworld mounts,<ref>{{bug|MC-303715||Pigs don't float when ridden in water|WAI}}</ref> pigs cannot float on water or lava (even if they have [[Fire Resistance]]) when being controlled. Pigs can be controlled through 1-block-high bodies of water with a carrot and stick, but deeper water causes the player to dismount. If the pig and rider fall, then fall damage doesn't cause any knockback or slower movement speed.

A player can travel through a space 1 block high by riding a pig. 
{{-}}

=== Lightning ===
When a pig or baby pig is struck by [[lightning]], it transforms into a [[zombified piglin]] or baby zombified piglin, respectively. If lightning strikes a pig in [[Peaceful]] difficulty, the pig does not transform but takes normal damage from the strike. If the pig was equipped with a saddle, the saddle is lost. If a player was riding the pig, they are kept mounted on the zombified piglin {{in|java}},<ref>{{bug|MC-276342||Player continues riding on Zombified Piglin after saddled pig is converted|WAI}}</ref> while {{in|bedrock}} they are dismounted.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-186403||Player does not continue riding on the Zombified Piglin you were riding on after saddled pig you were riding on is converted to a zombified piglin}}</ref>

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Pig.png|thumb|width=165x165|A temperate pig ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult unsaddled pig to form a [[jockey]].

== Trivia ==
* A pig appears as a DLC costume for the [https://www.ssbwiki.com/Mii_Brawler_(SSBU) Mii Brawler] in the crossover fighting game ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''.
* The warm variant of the pig is based on the {{W|red river hog}}, as revealed in Minecraft Live 2025.{{verify|youtube video timestamp?}}
** However the image that was used is a {{W|Mangalica|mangalica pig}}, likely by mistake.
<!--*For the upcoming baby pig model, the head is ''slightly'' shifted to the right to avoid planefighting.-->
* The third hurt sound for the piglet was reused from the [[Piggy Bank]] from Dungeons.
