The '''mangrove swamp''' is a wetland [[biome]] populated with [[mud]] and [[mangrove]]s where [[slime]]s, [[frog]]s, and [[bogged]] can spawn.

== Description ==
Mangrove swamp biomes are a variant of the [[swamp]] biome featuring dense [[mangrove tree]]s which vary in height. The floor is mainly composed of [[mud]] blocks with occasional grass block or dirt [[disk]]s. [[Seagrass]] litters the bottom of flooded areas, and [[lily pad]]s dot the water's surface.

{{IN|java}}, unlike most Overworld biomes, [[mushroom]]s do not generate here. The grass has the same color as the normal swamp, but leaves and vines have a unique light green tint, and the water is teal rather than gray. Warm frogs and tropical fish are the only passive mobs that spawn in this biome. 

Mangrove swamp biomes, alongside [[desert]]s and regular swamps, can generate [[fossil]]s underground. However, [[swamp hut]]s do not generate here.<ref>{{bug|MC-249932||Swamp huts don't generate within mangrove swamps|WAI}}</ref>

Mangrove swamp biomes are usually found in flat terrain near sea level in regions with very high [[World_generation#Biomes|erosion]] values, and they also replace [[river]]s in these areas. Mangrove swamps never directly border the [[ocean]]. However, their water bodies are often connected to the ocean. They generate next to [[savanna]]s, most [[windswept savanna]]s, some [[forest]]s, some [[plains]], [[jungle]]s, [[sparse jungle]]s, [[bamboo jungle]]s, and [[desert]]s. 

Underwater [[fog]] is thick here, making visibility lower underwater. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], mangrove swamps use a strong humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting similar to [[jungles]], which fades the distance in an orange tint. Mangrove swamps have unique atmospherics, lighting, and color grading, making the biome appear more humid and warm but not as much as jungles.

Mangrove trees generate more sparsely {{in|be}} than {{in|je}}.

== Mobs ==
[[Slime]]s may spawn in swamps during the night, exclusively between Y=50 and Y=70. Their spawn rate is affected by the [[moon phase]], spawning most often during full moon and not spawning at all during new moon. Bogged add an additional threat to the night, thunderstorms, or [[Cave|caves]]{{Only|Java|short=JE}}, as their poison arrows can increase the danger of [[hostile mob]]s.

[[Villager]]s that spawn in mangrove swamps get a unique swamp-themed look. While villagers have swamp-specific types, no [[village]] featuring exclusively these villagers can be generated. The only way for these villagers to spawn is either by a villager being bred in the swamp or mangrove swamp biomes, for a [[zombie villager]] that spawned in a swamp to be cured, or finding a [[village]] that generated with some parts reaching the swamp.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
