{{for|other uses|Seeds}}
The '''world seed''' (or simply '''seed'''; referred to as '''seed for the world generator''' in-game) is a value made up of character(s) (including negative or positive integers) that is used as the basis for [[world generation|generating every ''Minecraft'' world]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120307165955/https://www.mojang.com/2011/02/a-short-demystification-of-the-map-seed/ A Short Demystification of the 'Map Seed'] - Jens Bergensten on Mojang.com; February 23, 2011</ref>

== Compatibility ==
Seeds are somewhat compatible between ''[[Java Edition|Java]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', with terrain generation and biomes being the same. However, the placement of generated [[structure]]s differs between these editions.

== World generation ==
{{main|World generation}}

Whenever the game has to generate a new world, it calls upon an algorithm known as ''{{w|Perlin noise}}''. This algorithm outputs a pseudo-random value that is then used to determine the characteristics and features of the world. However, the algorithm always outputs the same value each time for a constant starting point (seed). Thus, the same seed generates the same terrain every time.

A world's seed is set when that world is created. By default, it is decided automatically, but it can also be set manually. Setting and reusing a seed from one world generates the same world. Either a number or a word/phrase can be used, including negatives. If a word/phrase is used, it is converted into a 32-bit integer using the <code>.hashCode()</code> method.

Whenever the world generation algorithm is updated (usually by adding new biomes to the game), the same seed no longer generates the same terrain. If the seed or generator changes in a saved world, new [[chunks]] are based on the new seed and no longer match those from the old seed. Deleted chunks can regenerate if the seed and generator remain the same, but changes if either the seed or generator changes. In fact, deleting chunks is sometimes done to let newly-introduced features appear in an old world; see [[Tutorials/Updating old oceans in 1.13 using MCEdit]].

Because seeds are simply random values read into an algorithm and not actually names of different worlds, using a certain seed does not result in a world with any relevance to the value of that seed. For instance, using a [[biome]] name as the seed does not necessarily result in the creation of a world with primarily that biome, nor does it spawn the player within the said biome.

{{Calculator|seedHashcode}}

== Determining the seed ==
{{IN|java}}, the player can enter the [[command]] {{command|seed}} to view and copy the world's seed. This command is available in singleplayer worlds even if cheats are off. The player can also select 'Re-create' in the Worlds menu to see the seed.

{{IN|bedrock}}, the seed can be found and copied on the [[World Options|world options]] screen. There are also [[seed templates]] that offers the player several pre-set seeds to generate worlds with specific features near the spawn point. Additionally, the beta version has a visible seed on the top of the screen.

== Notable seeds ==
{{info needed section|What seeds are used for Bedrock Edition panoramas?}}
The following map seeds have, at one point or another, been used for generating official ''Minecraft'' maps and resources or otherwise significant community material.

* The ''Java Edition'' demo world seed can be played in the full version by entering {{cd|North Carolina}} in the seed input.
** The [[Java Edition Beta 1.3_01|Beta 1.3_01]] PC Gamer demo world seed can be played in the appropriate era by entering {{cd|glacier}}, all lowercase unlike the famous seed where the G is capitalized, in the seed input.
* The seeds for many of the [[panorama]]s used on the [[Title Screen|title screen]] are as follows:
**The panorama used between [[Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release|Beta 1.8 Pre-release]] and [[Java Edition 18w22c|18w22c]] is either {{cd|2151901553968352745}} or {{cd|8091867987493326313}},<ref>{{reddit|hthrmk}}</ref> generated between [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6|Beta 1.6.6]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.7|Beta 1.7]].
** Bedrock Edition 1.2.0 uses {{cd|95475027}}, which is the same seed as the "Winding River" [[seed template]] generated before [[Bedrock Edition 1.18.0|1.18.0]].
** Java Edition 1.13 uses {{cd|1458140401}}, which is the seed resulting from typing {{cd|18w22a}} in as a seed, generated in snapshot [[18w22a]].
** Java Edition 1.14 uses {{cd|2802867088795589976}}, taken in [[18w48a]].
** Java Edition 1.15 uses {{cd|-4404205509303106230}}, taken in [[19w40a]].
** Java Edition 1.16 uses {{cd|6006096527635909600}}, taken in [[20w13a]].
** Java Edition 1.18 uses {{cd|2151901553968352745}}, taken in [[21w40a]].
** Java Edition 1.19 uses {{cd|-1696067516}}, which is the seed resulting from typing {{cd|thewildupdate}} in as a seed, taken in [[22w15a]].
** Java Edition 1.20 uses {{cd|8554477380691140270}}, taken in [[23w14a]].
** Java Edition 1.21.6 and Bedrock Edition 1.21.90 use {{cd|8819392414030687460}}, taken in [[25w20a]] and [[Bedrock Edition Preview 1.21.90.26|Preview 1.21.90.26]], respectively.
* The seed for the original pack.png file is {{cd|3257840388504953787}}. It was generated in Alpha v1.2.2<ref>{{reddit|iocx6f}}</ref>, It can also be generated between [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0|Alpha v1.2.0]] and [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3|Beta 1.7.3]] with minor population differences, and it's also the default seed for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition's New UI of Create New World when no seed is entered or created since [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.18.20.21]]. This seed spawns the player in a [[savanna]] biome at coordinates {{cd|Position: -208, 65, 0}}.
* The seed for the Skull on Fire [[painting]] is either {{cd|-6984854390176336655}} or {{cd|-1044887956651363087}}, generated in [[Java Edition Alpha v1.1.2_01|Alpha v1.1.2_01]] or prior.<ref>{{reddit|iqg3ey}}</ref>
* The seed used for the original [[Herobrine]] hoax screenshot is {{cd|478868574082066804}}, generated in [[Alpha v1.0.16_02]].
* The seed used for the original [[Herobrine]] hoax livestream is {{cd|3609313613745973624}}, generated in [[Alpha v1.0.17_04]].
* Seeds used for the [[Legacy Console Edition tutorial]] worlds:
** Each world is referred to by its respective [[Xbox 360 Edition]] update.
** [[Xbox 360 Edition TU1|TU1]] and [[Xbox 360 Edition TU3|TU3]] used the seed {{cd|1171544198849424676}}
** [[Xbox 360 Edition TU5|TU5]] used the seed {{cd|6173462}}
** [[Xbox 360 Edition TU7|TU7]] and [[Xbox 360 Edition TU9|TU9]] used the seed {{cd|96414766889474996}}
** [[Xbox 360 Edition TU12|TU12]] and [[Xbox 360 Edition TU14|TU14]] used the seed {{cd|1227750481513469519}}
** [[Xbox 360 Edition TU19|TU19]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU31|TU31]], [[Xbox 360 Edition TU46|TU46]], and [[Xbox 360 Edition TU69|TU69]] were artificially-created and can't be generated by any seed.


=== Generation anomalies ===
Some seeds are known to cause strange effects in the world generation, due to their mathematical properties. See [[Anomalous world seeds]] for more information.

== Technical ==

=== Realms ===
{{IN|java}}, a player can type {{cmd|seed}} in the chat. {{IN|bedrock}}, the seed is not visible when playing on Realms, but can be seen by downloading the world.

=== General ===
If the seed contains characters other than numbers (except the first character, which can be "-" or "+") or not a Java long number (an integer between -2<sup>63</sup> and 2<sup>63</sup>-1), the Java <code>String.hashCode()</code> function is used to generate a number seed. This restricts ''Minecraft'' to a subset of the possible worlds to 2<sup>32</sup> (or 4,294,967,296), due to the {{cd|int}} datatype used. Number seeds or a default world seed must be used to access the full set of possible worlds (which is 2<sup>64</sup>, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616, or 18.4 quintillion).

=== Overlap between editions ===
All ''Java'' and ''Bedrock Edition'' seeds in the range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807{{Verify|It seems that all seeds have the same terrain and biomes across editions.}} (64-bit seeds) generate the same terrain and [[biome]]s in both ''Java'' and ''Bedrock Edition''. However, [[structure]]s, [[feature]]s (i.e. decorators), [[carver]] caves, and [[Mob spawning|mob spawns]] will generate differently.
