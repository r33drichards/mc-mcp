'''15w40a''' is the twenty-ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on September 30, 2015.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/09/minecraft-snapshot-15w40a/</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Changes to mob pathfinding.
** Mobs now avoid [[cacti]] and [[fire]].
*** [[Blaze]]s don't avoid fire.
** Passive mobs following a player holding food now go around [[water]], if possible.
* Entities panicking and on fire preferentially run toward water within ±5 blocks horizontally and ±4 blocks vertically, even if they cannot actually reach it.

'''[[Shulker]]s'''
* No longer attack on [[Peaceful]] difficulty.
** Shulker bullets despawn on Peaceful, but not shulkers themselves.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Health]]'''
* Players regenerate {{hp|1}} every half-second instead of {{hp|1}} every 4 seconds, when saturation is not empty.
** Regenerating health increases exhaustion by 4 points rather than 3.
