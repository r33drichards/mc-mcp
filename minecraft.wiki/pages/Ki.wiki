{{Q|“Ki,” like “Key,” on the previous album is an introduction to the album. But this time it’s not quiet, somber and welcoming, but dark and foreboding.|C418|c418.org}}

'''"Ki"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Beta]]''.

== Track description ==
"Ki" is a reprise (a similar, but slightly different version of a previous track) of "[[Key (song)|Key]]" from ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]'', both with the same pronunciation. It opens with an echoey version of "Key", but then adds new layers of electronic ambient music, with a more darker tone.

The bass notes at 0:38 can also be heard in "[[Concrete Halls]]".
