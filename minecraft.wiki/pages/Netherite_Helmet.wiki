A '''netherite helmet''' is a late-game variant of [[helmet]] obtained by upgrading a [[diamond helmet]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]]. It is the highest [[tier]] of helmet, having higher armor toughness, durability, and [[enchantability]] than a diamond helmet. Like all [[netherite armor]], a netherite helmet provides 10% [[knockback resistance]] when worn, is immune to burning from [[fire]] and [[lava]] in item form, and takes no durability damage from lava when worn.

== Obtaining ==
=== Upgrading ===
{{Smithing|Netherite Upgrade|Diamond Helmet|Netherite Ingot|Netherite Helmet|head=1|tail=1}}

== Usage ==
When worn, a netherite helmet provides {{armor|3}} [[armor points]], {{armor|3}} [[armor toughness]], and 1 (10%) [[knockback resistance]].

As with all pieces of netherite armor, netherite helmets do not lose durability when protecting the player from fire damage.

Netherite helmets can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[netherite ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% the helmet's maximum durability, rounded down. Two netherite helmets can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the helmet's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A helmet can receive the following enchantments:

=== Armor trimming ===
It is possible to upgrade armor with trims. This requires a [[smithing template]], a netherite helmet, and an ingot or crystal ([[iron ingot]], [[copper ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[netherite ingot]], [[emerald]], [[redstone dust]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[amethyst shard]], [[Nether quartz]], [[diamond]], or [[resin brick]]).

These trims have no effect on the gameplay or strength of the armor.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Unlike the other helmets, the netherite helmet covers most of the player's face, due to a nose guard and cheek plates.
* Despite all helmets besides leather having a nose guard, the netherite helmet is the only one where it is visible in the inventory icon.
