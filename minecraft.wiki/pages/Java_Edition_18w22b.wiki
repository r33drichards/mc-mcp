'''18w22b''' is the forty-first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on May 29, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w22a|May 29, 2018}}</ref>.

== Changes ==
* Improved performance with animated textures.
* '''Version exclusive''': [[Bark]] blocks now follow identical placement rules to [[log]]s and other such blocks. As such, the texture was changed later.
* Usernames tab-complete again in regular chat.
* All command feedback messages are now translatable.
