The '''underwater torch''' is a non-solid [[block]] that emits [[light]] underwater.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Underwater torch is immediately destroyed when broken.
{{breaking row|Underwater Torch|horizontal=1}}
Underwater torch drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Crafting ===

|Output= Underwater Torch
|type= Decoration block
|description={{only|bedrock|education}}
}}

== Usage ==
The underwater torch can be used exactly like a normal torch, only it can be underwater.
* Underwater torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some require {{control|sneaking}} (see [[#Placement|placement]] for exceptions). Being non-solid, an underwater torch has no collision box.
* Gravity-affected blocks like [[sand]] and [[gravel]] do not fall if the block below them has an underwater torch on it, and they break if they fall onto an underwater torch.

=== Placement ===
In general, underwater torches can be placed only on solid, opaque, and full blocks; exceptions are listed below.

=== Light ===
Underwater torches emit a [[light]] level of 14. Underwater torches also melt [[snow layer]]s and [[ice]] within 2 blocks ([[taxicab distance]]).

=== Piston interactivity ===
Underwater torch is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].

== Trivia ==
* The crafting recipe refers to the fact that magnesium metal can burn in pure water vapor. Magnesium has a similar reaction with hot water, but it is slower and does not look like burning.
* If magnesium catches fire, water cannot be used to extinguish it. This is because magnesium reacts with hot water (and water vapor) to form explosive hydrogen gas.
