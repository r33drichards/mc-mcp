=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Block of Diamond JE1.png|32px]] [[Block of Diamond|Block of Emerald]]'''
* Currently unobtainable without world editors.
* Not in the starting house chest.

'''[[File:Diamond Ore JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Diamond Ore|Emerald ore]]'''
* Drops 1-3 emeralds.

'''[[File:Invicon Gear.gif|32px]] [[Gear]]'''<ref group="note">Evidence of gear introduction in this version:
* The in-20100125 jar contains no gear textures.
* The in-20100128-2304 jar does contain gear textures, which are dated January 26, 2010 1:13-1:15 UTC.
* Notch's January 26, 2010 1:36 UTC [[YouTube]] video displays functioning gears.
* This is evidence that functional gears were in any version released between January 26, 2010 1:15 UTC and January 29, 2010 14:53 UTC.
** ''That includes this version.''</ref>
* Can only be obtained by inventory editing and initially invisible in the inventory.<ref>{{link|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0888sLzYM4&t=2m12s|title=Minecraft particles, chests and spitting lava blobs. And a surprise.|author=[https://www.youtube.com/user/Nizzotch Nizzotch]}} January 26, 2010 1:36 UTC. Archived from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9H_ymjT-4E the original] on April 22, 2018.</ref> 
* A gear's sprite consists of two parts; the center rod and the animated gear itself.
* When hacked into the game, a gear can be placed anywhere, but would show nothing in its block space and would be invisible unless horizontally adjacent to one or more blocks.
** The placed gear would then show a gear sprite on the near side of each of those blocks.
** A placed gear cannot be destroyed by mining a block that its gear sprite is shown on, because the placed gear is actually adjacent to that block.
** If the block a gear sprite is shown on is destroyed, the adjacent placed gear would no longer show that sprite.
** Removing all blocks adjacent to a placed gear would remove all of its visible gear sprites, leaving the placed gear invisible.
** Placed gears cannot be destroyed directly by the player; attempts to do so would phase through to the block behind it, much like [[water]].
** A placed gear can only be removed by explosions.
