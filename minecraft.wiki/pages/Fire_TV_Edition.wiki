'''''Minecraft: Fire TV Edition''''' was the former title of {{el|be}} designed specifically for the {{w|Amazon Fire TV}}. Originally, the ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' Alpha for Fire OS was available on Fire TV, but it was replaced by the more expensive ''Fire TV Edition'' on December 19, 2016, the day that the [[Ender Update]] and ''[[Apple TV Edition]]'' released. ''Pocket Edition'' for Fire TV was discontinued, and the new edition was a free download for its previous owners. Following the [[Better Together Update]], it is no longer named ''Fire TV Edition''.

As of June 2021, ''Minecraft'' is no longer supported on Fire TV Gen 1 and Fire TV Gen 2.<ref>{{link|title=Important news regarding Minecraft on Android and FireTV|author=Staff|website=Minecraft.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928065933/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/important-news-regarding-minecraft-android-and-firetv}}</ref>

== Amazon naming and pricing ==
As of March 2019, this product was described as "Minecraft for Fire TV" on the Amazon App Store, potentially deviating from the practice of referring to all ''Bedrock Edition'' variants as simply "Minecraft". In Amazon usage, the plain "Minecraft" name referred only to the (Bedrock) edition for (non-TV) Android platforms. 

The "for Fire TV" version retains a much higher price point than the vanilla Android versions (about 3x more as of March 2019).

== Trivia ==
* This version requires it to be installed from Amazon Appstore and doesn't use Google Play services.<ref>{{ytl|EgVfUjLgYbE|Minecraft's Lost Version <nowiki>|</nowiki> The Only Version You CAN'T Play|May 13, 2024}}</ref>
