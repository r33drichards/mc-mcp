'''Gold nuggets'''{{efn|Also known as '''golden nuggets''' in [[Language#Differences between English variants|British English]].}} are minimum pieces of gold used to craft [[gold ingot]]s and other various golden items. They can be obtained by [[smelting]] golden [[tool]]s, [[weapon]]s, or [[armor]]. One gold nugget is effectively worth one-ninth of a gold ingot.

=== Mining ===
[[Nether gold ore]] mined using a [[pickaxe]] drops 2-6 gold nuggets. If the pickaxe is enchanted with [[Fortune]], it has a 33.3% chance to multiply the drops by 2, Fortune II has a 25% chance to multiply the drops by 2 or 3 and Fortune III has a 20% chance each to multiply the drops by 2, 3, or 4 for a maximum possible drop of 24 golden nuggets. The average drop rate for a Fortune III pickaxe is 8.8, while the drop rate for a [[Silk Touch]] pickaxe is a single ingot, or a flat rate of 9. It is slightly more efficient to mine with a Silk Touch pickaxe. 

[[Gilded blackstone]] mined using a pickaxe has a 10% chance to drop 2-5 gold nuggets. If the pickaxe is enchanted with Fortune I, the chance gold nuggets drop is increased 14.29%, Fortune II increases the drop chance to 25%, and Fortune III guarantees the drop.

== Usage ==
Gold nuggets can be used to craft a [[golden carrot]] or [[glistering melon]] for brewing. Also, gold nuggets can be combined with gunpowder and dye to create a [[firework star]] that bursts in a star-shaped explosion. 

[[Piglin]]s instantly pick up any gold nuggets that are within 1 [[block]] of them. Unlike other gold-related items, they do not intentionally seek out gold nuggets to pick up and only pick them up if they walk near it. Unlike gold ingots, gold nuggets picked up are dropped upon the piglin's death. They also do not inspect the gold nugget.
