'''Featured servers''' are community servers for ''Bedrock Edition'', which are partnered with [[Mojang Studios]] and are accessible from the in-game [[server list]]. In the console versions, they are the only servers accessible besides [[Realms]]. Although ''Bedrock Edition'' lacks the [[Mini Games]] from [[Legacy Console Edition]], featured servers can have their own minigames to play online. Featured servers require a Microsoft account<ref name="btfaq">{{Mcnet|better-together-faq|Better Together FAQ|July 31, 2017}}</ref> and a paid online multiplayer subscription service on consoles only. However, they have microtransactions that can be purchased from their own sections of the [[Marketplace]].

Featured servers were first added as part of [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0|1.2.0]], the [[Better Together Update]]. There are currently eight featured servers, and Mojang Studios plans to add more in the future.{{cn}} Server owners with registered business identities can [https://developer.microsoft.com/Minecraft apply] for the partner program. Mojang Studios provides partnered servers with backend support.<ref name="btfaq" />

== Safety ==
Featured servers require the player to have a Microsoft account.<ref name="btfaq" /> Players can add, mute, block, and report players from the pause menu upon selecting a player's profile. The server partners work with a team of volunteers to monitor bad behavior, including bullying and cheating, and help report issues. Each server partner includes their own expanded word filter list to make their server experience appropriate for all ages. At Mojang Studios' request, all official server partners have removed private messaging, including the {{cmd|tell}}, {{cmd|msg}}, and {{cmd|w}} commands, to allow more thorough moderation across all parts of the server.<ref name="safety">{{Mcnet|minecraft-multiplayer-server-safety|How to Stay Safe Online|July 28, 2017}}</ref>

== Language support ==
All featured servers automatically detect the player's [[language]] by the language set in the settings menu. Some servers may have additional ways to change the in-game language, specifically for the server the player is on.
