'''23w07a''' is the fifth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.4]], released on February 15, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w07a|February 15, 2023}}</ref> which adds the [[sniffer]], [[cherry grove]]s, and [[archaeology]] under experimental features, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Interaction]]'''
* A new type of entity that records {{ctrl|attack|text=attacks}} and {{ctrl|interact|text=interactions}}. Interactions (<code>interaction</code>) are invisible and of a custom size, with following fields:
** <code>width</code>: Width of the entity's bounding box (default is 1).
** <code>height</code>: Height of the entity's bounding box (default is 1).
** <code>attack</code>: An action object, records the last attack action on the entity.
** <code>interaction</code>: An action object, records the last interaction action on the entity.
** <code>response</code>: Boolean specifying if interacting should trigger a response (arm swing, sound effects, etc - default <code>false</code>).
* Introduced action object accordingly. When an action is stored, it always has two fields:
** <code>player</code>: The UUID (in standard integer array format) of the player performing the action.
** <code>timestamp</code>: The timestamp of the game tick when the event happened (stored as a long).
* This made following command usage possible:
** Execute command as the last player who attacked the entity when using {{cmd|execute on attacker}}.
** Execute command as the last player who interacted with the entity when using {{cmd|execute on target}}.
* Advancement triggers also got triggered, when:
** Interacting with an interaction entity: <code>player_interacted_with_entity</code>.
** Attacking an interaction entity: <code>player_hurt_entity</code>.

=== General ===
'''[[Recipe]]'''
* Added a new recipe serializer <code>crafting_decorated_pot</code> for the new [[decorated pot]] recipe.
* Added <code>show_notification</code> field to recipes.
** Accepts a boolean which determines if a notification is shown when unlocking this recipe.
** Defaults to <code>true</code> if isn't specified.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added following item tags:
** <code>#axes</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|diamond_axe|stone_axe|golden_axe|netherite_axe|wooden_axe|iron_axe}}.
** <code>#breaks_decorated_pots</code>: contains {{cd|#tools}}.
** <code>#hoes</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|diamond_hoe|stone_hoe|golden_hoe|netherite_hoe|wooden_hoe|iron_hoe}}.
** <code>#pickaxes</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|diamond_pickaxe|stone_pickaxe|golden_pickaxe|netherite_pickaxe|wooden_pickaxe|iron_pickaxe}}.
** <code>#shovels</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|diamond_shovel|stone_shovel|golden_shovel|netherite_shovel|wooden_shovel|iron_shovel}}.
** <code>#swords</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|diamond_sword|stone_sword|golden_sword|netherite_sword|wooden_sword|iron_sword}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Realms]]'''
* Updated the "Realms" screen to be more in line with the "Singleplayer" and "Multiplayer" screens.
