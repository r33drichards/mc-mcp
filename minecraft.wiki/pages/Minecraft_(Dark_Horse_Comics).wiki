| style="text-align: center;" | October 16, 2024
| style="text-align: center;" | [[Farmer Cobb]] likes to keep his crops as neat as possible, which is frustrating when he has neighbors who like to chow down on his fresh produce without asking and villagers who can’t stop themselves from planting [[potatoes]] in his field without rhyme or reason. After a rough encounter with an [[Enderman]] he finally decides to get as far away from everyone and everything as he can… building a tower up into the sky!

When a stranger shows up on his new sky island and reveals a whole town full of people who desired peace and quiet just like Cobb, he accepts an invitation to join the town of like-minded hermits and moves onto a plot they so generously give him. But he learns that his neighbors in the sky might be even more disruptive than those on the ground. As tensions rise sky high, he is reminded that he didn’t just have neighbors down below, but caring friends. Friends he may need to protect.

| style="text-align:center;" | February 17, 2026
| style="text-align:center;" | Cobb considers himself a simple farmer and, until recently, a bit of a loner. He’s content to mind his crops, gather resources, and be left alone. But fate has more in store for Cobb than intercepting the wayward villagers who replace his carrots with potatoes!

When a mysterious treasure map captures the imagination of Cobb’s young friend Rochelle, she tries to inspire his adventurous side. But when Cobb refuses to join her, Rochelle decides to follow the map all on her own—leaving Cobb a copy in case he changes his mind. Sure enough, Cobb is thrust into action when his adventure-obsessed brother, Flint, points out that the map leads straight through an area so dense with hostile mobs that even he (brave and strong as he is) avoids it. The threat of danger to their friend Rochelle propels them on a journey across biomes unknown, filled with grand surprises they’ll never forget.

The two brothers couldn’t be more different, but they must work together if they hope to help Rochelle discover the treasure she seeks. The trio makes for an unusual squad—but sometimes surviving the world of Minecraft requires unlikely friendships.

| style="text-align: center;" | [[Riley]] is an unassuming farmer living a comfortable life in a small hillside hamlet, with little desire for adventure. This all changes when the militant [[Province of Perfect Sameness]] storms into town and flattens their home, led by the identical twins, [[Paula]] and [[Prentice]]. The twin’s campaign to impose their vision of “perfect sameness” on the Overworld forces Riley and friends into action, sending them all on the adventure of a lifetime!

Riley employs the aid of friend [[Charlie]], a brilliant builder with a tendency to ignore health and safety rules and overuse [[TNT]] which has earned him the reputation as town troublemaker — and [[Jesse (Out of Order)|Jesse]], a loner and former warrior for the Province of Perfect Sameness who is torn by guilt over her service with the Province. Together, they must venture to the Province’s fortress, cross [[swords]] with the twin’s legion of soldiers, and pull off their biggest (and ''only'') heist ever to steal back all the materials taken from their [[Hamlet]]!

The three adventurers set out on their mission only to be derailed by a horde of loot-loving bandits. Fortunately, the superstar adventurer Godrick arrives just in time to save the day! Charlie and Riley are awe-stuck in Godrick’s presence, yet Emily isn’t nearly so impressed. Is their snooty, swashbuckling idol all he’s cracked up to be? As the companions battle and build their way through chunks of mob-infested wilderness, Godrick’s star power drives a wedge between them. Can their friendship survive until they reach their destination, or will the adventurers have to survive the Overworld without their friends?
