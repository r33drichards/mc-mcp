A '''netherite pickaxe''' is a late-game variant of [[pickaxe]] obtained by upgrading a [[diamond pickaxe]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]]. It is the highest [[tier]] of pickaxe, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, attack damage, and [[enchantability]] than a [[diamond pickaxe]]. It has a [[mining level]] of 4, which is functionally identical to a mining level of 3, allowing it to <abbr title="break while also dropping an item">mine</abbr> [[obsidian]] and [[ancient debris]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Upgrading ===
Like other diamond tools, a [[diamond pickaxe]] can be upgraded to a netherite pickaxe, increasing its [[durability]] and [[mining efficiency]], as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item. The upgraded pickaxe will keep its enchantments, name and other item data.

== Usage ==
{{main|Pickaxe#Usage}}

=== Mining ===
A netherite pickaxe is used to break stone and metal-based materials faster. Breaking a block with a netherite pickaxe consumes one use (one durability point). No durability is consumed for blocks that have a hardness value of 0, such as [[torch]]es and [[flower]]s.

==== Mining level ====
Netherite pickaxes have a mining level of 4. A mining level of 4 is functionally identical to a mining level of 3, so there are no blocks that a netherite pickaxe can mine that a [[diamond pickaxe]] can’t.

=== Weapon ===
==== {{JE}} ====
All pickaxes have an attack speed modifier of -2.8, meaning they take about 0.85 seconds to [[recover]]. Netherite pickaxes do {{hp|6}} damage per attack, or 7.2 damage per second.

==== {{BE}} ====
All pickaxes attack instantly, with netherite pickaxes doing {{hp|7}} damage per attack.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

A netherite pickaxe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[netherite ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the pickaxe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two netherite pickaxes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the pickaxe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A netherite pickaxe can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
