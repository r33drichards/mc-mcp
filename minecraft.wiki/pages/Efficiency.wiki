'''Efficiency''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to tools that increases [[mining efficiency]].

== Obtaining ==
[[Tool]]s of any material except stone or diamond can receive up to Efficiency V through the [[enchanting table]]<ref>{{bug|MC-275443}}</ref>. Stone and diamond tools can only receive up to level IV through the enchanting table, but can be given Efficiency V by combining 2 items with Efficiency IV in an [[anvil]]. Diamond tools with Efficiency V can also be found in [[end city]], [[ancient city]], and [[bastion remnant]] chests.

[[Enchanted books]] enchanted with a random level of Efficiency can be found in loot chests in the following structures: [[desert pyramid]]s, [[stronghold]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[ancient city|ancient cities]], [[woodland mansion]]s, [[pillager outpost]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, and from vaults in [[trial chambers]].

[[Enchanted books]] and [[tool]]s with a random Efficiency level can be obtained through [[trading]] with [[villager]]s.

== Usage ==
{{main|Breaking#Mining efficiency}}
Efficiency adds 2 mining efficiency for the first level, 5 for the second level, 10 for the third level, 17 for the fourth level, and 26 for the fifth level. The proper tool for a block must be used in order to receive the speed benefit, as the enchantment has no effect if the block is mined with the incorrect tool.

== Mining efficiency ==
Each level gives (Level^2)+1 Mining Efficiency if not level is 0, added on to the Base Mining Efficiency.

These tables detail how much mining efficiency is gained based on the level of enchantment used.‌
