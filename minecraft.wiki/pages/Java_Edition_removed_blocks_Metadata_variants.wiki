=== Removed in 1.8 (14w26a) ===
These existed due to the previous handling of block variations through metadata, rather than through block states or as separate IDs. Extreme values of these would produce unintended effects.

==== Faceless pumpkins and jack o'lanterns ====
It was possible to place [[pumpkin]]s and [[jack o'lantern]] with no actual face using metadata values 5 and above. Their models became missing in 14w10a and they were removed in snapshot 14w26a like other unintended blocks.

In 17w47a, the faceless pumpkin was reintroduced as the default pumpkin block, with the existing pumpkins being retconned as carved pumpkins.

==== Faceless and exceptional furnaces ====
[[Furnace]]s (as well as lit furnaces) with metadata values 0, 1, 6, 7, 12 and 13 would have no faces, using the side texture for all orthogonal faces and the usual top and bottom texture on the top and bottom. Furnaces and lit furnaces with data values 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 would appear normal, but were probably not legitimately obtainable.

Unlike with many blocks, these need to be placed using external editors, as {{cmd|setblock}} always places a furnace within the normal range.

All of these invalid furnaces and lit furnaces lost their models in 14w10a, with the exception of the unlit furnace with data value 0, which kept the faceless appearance. The lit furnace with no facing direction regained its model sometime between 14w17a and 14w21b.

==== Weird pistons ====
{{main|Six-sided Piston}}

Six-sided versions of the [[piston]] block. When powered, some would cause immediate game crashes, which could be exploited for update suppression.

It took until 14w17a for weird piston blocks to lose their model and use the missing one.

==== Six-sided hay bale ====
<div style="float:right;">
[[File:Hay Bale (no direction) JE1 BE1.png|A six-sided hay bale (side texture).|150px]]
</div>
[[Hay bale]]s with the side texture on all six faces existed until block variants were defined using block states rather than metadata.

The hay bale lost its model in 14w10a like many other blocks.

Interestingly, other six-sided blocks resulting from similar circumstances such as [[wood]] and [[smooth stone]] were not removed, and were even given unique block IDs and made [[crafting|craftable]] in later updates.
{{-}}

==== Green shrub ====
{{main|Green Shrub}}

These blocks had an identical texture to the [[shrub]] and [[dead bush]], with the main difference being that it was [[tint]]ed based on the biome.

Unlike the usual shrub, its inclusion within the game was most likely ''un''intentional, as it became present in the game only after 13w10a (as it crashed the game from 13w02a to 13w09c, and appeared identical to usual grass beforehand), and sported a missing model after 14w10a like many other undefined blocks.

==== Overgrown cocoa ====
[[Cocoa]] has twelve possible block state combinations, as it has four possible orientations coupled with three distinct stages of growth. Before the introduction of proper block states, this therefore meant that twelve of the possible sixteen metadata variants were actually used, resulting in the uppermost four exhibiting interesting undefined behavior.

From their introduction up until and including 13w01b, they used the [[dragon egg]] texture, which makes sense as the dragon egg texture was directly to the left of the cocoa pod texture in <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp>. From 13w10a up to 14w06, it appeared as a broken cocoa pod, and from then on up to its removal it used missing models.

==== Overgrown wheat ====
{{main|Wheat Seeds/Asset history}}
Because [[wheat]] has eight distinct growth stages, the other upper eight values went completely unused. As a result, for a relatively long period of time, wheat crops with such values would see vast unintentional changes, as the [[textures]] they would try to pull from would end up overflowing over to the next line of <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp>. In certain versions, this included the textures commonly speculated to be for [[chair]] and table blocks.

==== Overgrown melon and pumpkin stems ====
[[Melon stem|Melon]] and [[pumpkin stem]]s also have eight distinct stages of growth. However, instead of having eight individual textures for each of the eight growth stages, each stage reveals two more pixels of the stem texture from the top down, and the [[tint]] applied to the stem texture also changes. As a result, since the stems have eight unused upper values in addition to the eight lower used states, the upper states start pulling from the texture below the stem texture on the [[texture atlas]] currently in use (see [[stitched terrain.png]]; the texture placed below will often vary with resource packs), and they use extreme tints that cannot normally be applied in normal gameplay. Their wireframe [[hitbox]]es would also appear to extend above the bounds of the block when targeted, but attempting to target anything above the height of the block would result in the stem not actually being targeted.

==== Overeaten cakes ====
[[File:Cake (7 bites) JE1.png|right|96px]]
There are six different states [[cake]] can legitimately be in: either intact, or in one of five progressively more eaten states, which was kept track of via block metadata like with many other blocks. Like with many blocks previously showcased, only some of these states were truly legitimately accessible. As such, interesting behavior is demonstrated by the inaccessible states.

Cakes with six bites, while obtainable now, were never actually obtainable in the game during the time when these odd overeaten cakes existed. Cakes with seven bites were completely two-dimensional, and cakes with eight through fifteen bites appeared especially glitchy, proceeding to invert themselves, such that their textures would be visible only on the inside rather than the outside, and these textures would be borrowed from adjacent spots of the texture atlas currently in use. Their wireframe hitboxes would also visually extend in this direction, but they could actually be targeted only by aiming at the portion of that hitbox within the block the cake is really situated. Collision boxes for these are similarly odd.

==== Minor removed block variants ====
Certain blocks had removed variants with minor, but still notable, quirks.

===== Invisible stairs =====
Originally, [[stair]] blocks with data values 4 through 15 would be completely invisible and have no collisions; the only indication of their existence was their full block hitbox outline when targeted.

In 12w08a, these data values would go on to be used for the newly implemented upside down stairs. Data values 8 through 15 would appear to just be duplicates of 0 through 7, and were probably unused in themselves until their removal. These last eight were removed in 14w26a, like other invalid blocks. They also never used the missing model. 

<gallery>

Visible stair block.png|After 12w08a
</gallery>

===== Wall sign with full block hitbox =====
[[File:Full hitbox wall sign.png|160px|right]]
Wall-mounted [[sign]]s used block metadata values 2, 3, 4 and 5 to determine their facing direction. As a result, wall signs placed with data values 0, 1 or anything 6 and above would always appear facing south, and have the wireframe hitbox (but not physical collision box) of a full block.

In 14w25a, opening a world with wall signs with data values 0, 1, 6, 7, 12 or 13 crashes the game, while attempting to place them with commands places a wall sign with data value 2 (facing north) instead. Wall signs with invalid data values were fully removed in 14w26a.

===== Invisible random ladders =====
[[File:Missing Model JE1.png|160px|right]]
[[Ladder]]s also used block metadata values 2, 3, 4 and 5 to determine their facing direction. As a result, ladders placed with data values 0, 1 or anything 6 and above exhibited behavior atypical of normal ladders. Notably, they would appear to readily switch what block face they were attached to (sometimes seemingly randomly, but could be controlled by looking at a valid ladder, in which case they end up switching to whatever its hitbox was), which could be seen through their wireframe hitbox and their collision box. Initially they would be full cubes.

For most of their existence they appeared completely invisible, although in 14w07a they changed to using the missing model. In 14w25a, opening a world with ladders with data values 0, 1, 6 or 7 crashes the game, while attempting to place them with commands places a ladder with data value 2 (facing north) instead. Ladders with data values 8 or higher behave as north-facing ladders, but still use the missing model. Ladders with invalid data values were fully removed in 14w26a.

Vines with data value 0 also appeared with the missing model, which was tinted for a while, however they still exist in 1.17 (as vines with all states set to false).

===== Incorrectly modeled torches =====
When block metadata was still in use, [[torch]]es used state 5 for normal floor attachment and 1, 2, 3 and 4 for wall torches. 0, 6 and 7 appear to be unused, and are visually identical to normal torches. 0 can be obtained only via external editors, and not by setblock.

Torches with data values 8 and up appear to exhibit interesting behavior: 8, 13, 14 and 15 appeared and behaved as normal floor torches. However, 9, 10, 11 and 12 would have the wireframe hitboxes of wall torches, but would appear as floor torches, causing the hitbox to be detached from the torch.

Redstone torches are affected in much the same way.

Loading a chunk with these in 14w06a causes a game crash. These became small missing cubes in 14w06b before graduating to full missing cubes in 14w10a until their removal in 14w26a.

===== Strange buttons =====
Note: due to the inconsistent nature of these blocks, certain details are not fully confirmed.

In 1.7.10, using commands to place a [[button]] with data value 0, 13, 14 or 15 results in odd behavior. The button appears as a full oak planks or stone block, until (possibly) another button is observed or an item of said button is obtained, at which point it uses item model of button. They do not appear to change shape when pressed in either case.

Much information regarding these buttons remains unknown as these are inconsistent in their behavior and also somewhat unstable, breaking frequently, and their behavior probably also changes drastically per version. Despite never actually changing data value, they seem to differently register what block face they are attached to each time.

What exactly the other data values of buttons were that were unused and eventually removed are unknown.

===== Bottomless and bricking hoppers =====
[[Hopper]]s with a metadata value of 1 or 9 would previously not actually appear to point in any direction. They functionally push items upward, however the behavior is inconsistent. Like many of these removed blocks, they had a missing model from 14w10a up to their removal.

Using {{cmd|setblock}} to place a hopper with a metadata value of 6, 7, 14 or 15 would crash the game and effectively brick the world unless it was edited using external software to remove the offending hopper.

===== Nether portal post =====
{{main|Nether Portal (block)}}
[[File:Nether Portal (unconnected) JE3.png|96px|right]]
In 1.7.2's development, [[Nether portal]]s placed with data value 3, 7, 11, or 15 resulted in a vertical Nether portal beam block.

===== Other unused metadata values =====
Prior to the introduction of proper block states, the 0–15 block metadata system applied to all blocks. This had absolutely no effect on the majority of blocks. All interesting cases are mentioned in above sections – those that remain are listed below.

All of these gained a missing model in 14w10a and were removed in 14w26a (with increasingly unstable behavior in 14w25a and 14w25b, usually causing game crashes when approached) unless explicitly stated otherwise.

=== Removed in 1.13 (17w47a) ===
These were the result of block state handling combined with the old block ID system, resulting in some odd combinations.

==== Redundant seamless double slabs ====
[[File:Seamless cobblestone.png|250px|right]]
In [[Java Edition 13w04a|13w04a]], [[Seamless Stone Slab|double stone slabs]] were changed so that those with data values 8 through 15 would use the top texture on all six sides. This resulted in the return of the block that would several years later become [[Smooth Stone]], and also introduced the [[Smooth Sandstone]] and [[Smooth Quartz Block]]. However, as the smooth stone double slab block also housed the cobblestone, old (later petrified) oak, bricks, stone bricks and nether bricks slabs, these would also end up having "seamless" double slab variants that were visually no different from their normal double slabs or indeed their normal blocks. These blocks persisted up to [[Java Edition 17w47a|17w47a]], where they were removed by [[the Flattening]].

==== Snowy dirt and snowy coarse dirt ====
As [[podzol]] was a numerical variant of dirt prior to 1.13, the snowy block state it used also ended up applying to dirt and coarse dirt, with no effect. These were removed in 1.13.
