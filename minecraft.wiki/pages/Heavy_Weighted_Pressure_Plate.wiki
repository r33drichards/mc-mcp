A '''heavy weighted pressure plate''' is a type of [[pressure plate]] that produces a [[redstone]] signal while an [[entity]] is touching it. Depending on how many entities are touching it between 1 and the maximum of 141, the outputted [[signal strength]] will range from 1 to 15.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A heavy weighted pressure plate can be mined with anything, but [[pickaxe]]s are the fastest. A heavy weighted pressure plate also breaks and drops itself if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if the block under the pressure plate is moved or destroyed.

=== Placement ===
{{main|Pressure Plate#Placement}}
A heavy weighted pressure plate can only be placed on the top of other blocks with either a full solid block face, a solid center, or a solid rim.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}
A heavy weighted pressure plate detects all [[entities]] on top of it, outputting a redstone signal strength of 1 for every 10 entities present, starting at 1.

==== Activation ====
{{main|Pressure Plate#Activation}}

While active, a heavy weighted pressure plate weakly powers itself, and strongly powers the block it is placed on.

The power level output varies depending on the number of entities colliding with the pressure plate.

The signal strength from a weighted pressure plate does not vary with the type of entity. 15 mobs will produce the same signal strength as 15 different items. Note the heavy weighted pressure plate counts entities, not quantity of items, generally leading to one entity count per stack of items. For more information see [[Item (entity)#Behavior| item entity behavior]].

=== Behavior ===
A heavy weighted pressure plate is a [[non-solid block]], allowing entities to freely pass through it.

The visual height of a pressure plate is {{frac|1|16}} of a block when inactive and {{frac|1|32}} of a block when active.

[[Fluid]]s flow around a heavy weighted pressure plate without affecting it.
