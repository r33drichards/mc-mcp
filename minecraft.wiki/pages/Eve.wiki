'''Eve''' is an [[evoker]] appearing in ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]'' and member of Team Woodland.

== Appearance ==
She resembles a normal evoker, stylized to fit with the rest of her series. The only apparent differences from a normal evoker are a green bracelet on her right hand, representing her team, and brunette eyebrows.

== Personality ==
Eve is portrayed as an entirely silent character, lacking any dialogue or even mild grunts. As such, it is uncertain what her exact personality is. When banished by [[CommuniKate]], she makes a face of disapproval or contempt towards her, and when actually sent into the cage is visibly anxious by the situation. Later, when several other contestants had been captured, she is seen huddling with [[Vin]], seemingly seeking comfort or assuring him. Even after they stop being an official team on the show, the two are almost never seen apart.

== Powers and abilities ==
Being an evoker, Eve is able to summon [[Vex|vexes]]. In her case, she summons ones without [[Iron Sword|iron swords]], which she attempts to use to carry her and Vin. However, they do not appear strong enough to support either of them. It can be presumed that hers are also not intangible, as they're not used to pierce the cage she becomes trapped in for much of the first season, and definitely not powerful enough to defeat [[Poseidon]] in season 2.

== Biography ==
Alongside Vin, Eve was kidnapped by CommuniKate using a [[Command Block|command block]], and was forced to participate on her game show against her will. Upon being brought to [[Birch Island]], she and Vin were teleported incorrectly, warping in several feet into the air and falling into a pool. The first challenge given is to survive on Birch Island past nightfall with only the supplies found on the island; it is unclear how she and Vin survived.

The second challenge is to investigate a mineshaft, and look for [[gold]], whether that be [[Gold Ore|gold ore]] or lone [[Gold Ingot|gold ingots]]. During the adventure, [[Durango]] manages to locate a "motherload" above a pit of [[lava]], with each of the teams employing a different strategy for reaching it. For Team Woodland, they decide to use vexes to carry themselves over, however they both prove too heavy. Vin ends up plummeting straight into the lava, killing him. It is then revealed that contestants who die disqualify their entire team, banishing both members into a cage made out of [[obsidian]].

Later in the season, after many others had been exiled into the cage, Eve took part in an escape plan, using [[Diamond Pickaxe|diamond pickaxes]] created by [[Toby]] to break out with the others. After a lengthy battle, Eve would then help encase a [[Slowness|slowed]] CommuniKate in obsidian herself. The situation resolved, Toby would then try using a command block to return Eve and Vin back to their home in the [[Dark Forest|dark forest]], before any of the other teams. However, the command block was actually preprogrammed by CommuniKate to send the contestants over to the [[Greek Isles]], in hope of a second season.

Upon the second season actually starting, Eve, Vin, and the majority of the previous season's cast would be held captive by Poseidon. As part of his plan for world domination, he held them trapped on top of [[sand]] blocks, and incentivized the remaining participants to secure "[[Enchanted Ender Eye]]s" before a time limit in order to save them. In truth, he had no intention of letting any of them free, leaving Eve to be saved by the season 2 team, as well as Toby and [[River (Character)|River]].

== Relationships == 
=== Vin ===
Еve and Vin were likely comrades before the series began, as they were both teleported from the same [[Woodland Mansion]].

=== Quinn === 
While they were not on friendly terms, Evе helped Quinn sabotage the show and defeat Poseidon.

== Trivia ==
* The name "Eve" is a diminutive-affectionate form of "evoker", which is who Eve is.
* Despite having a name shown at the beginning of multiple episodes, CommniKate refers to her only as Evoker when banishing her.
