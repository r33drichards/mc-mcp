== Trivia ==
* Wołkowicz's nickname was taken from a character in a book he was reading for school,<ref>{{ytl|_i9McaJYino|t=56m51s|280 - The Gnembon Phenomenon // The Spawn Chunks: A Minecraft Podcast|The Spawn Chunks|Jan 15, 2024}}</ref> which is most likely Gnębon Puczymorda from ''[https://culture.pl/en/work/the-shoemakers-stanislaw-ignacy-witkiewicz Szewcy]'' by Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz. It was first used as his username in the video game ''{{w|Heroes of Might and Magic}} II'' or ''III''. He later decided to keep this name for his YouTube channel, as a way of separating his gaming life from his personal life.<ref>{{ytl|ghQODkq4ITI|t=1186|Mojang Dev Comes To Hermitcraft!
