'''Invisibility''' is a [[status effect]] that turns [[player]]s and [[mob]]s completely transparent and see-through, but has no effect on held [[item]]s, worn [[armor]], or certain parts of some mobs.

== Effect ==
[[File:Invisible Mobs.png|thumb|right|The visible parts of a [[breeze]], a [[shulker]], a saddled [[strider]], a [[trader llama]], a [[phantom]], an [[enderman]], a spider, a saddled [[pig]], and a [[charged creeper]]]]
[[File:Invisible Jeb.png|thumb|right|The visible parts of an armored [[player]].]]

Invisibility has three effects: It causes the affected entity's model to disappear, it decreases the distance the player can be detected by mobs, and it hides the player's waypoint from the [[locator bar]].

=== Rendering ===
While under the invisibility effect, the model and name of mobs and players are not rendered, making the mob or player appear to be invisible. This does not prevent the mob or player from interacting with the world.

Certain features of mobs and players are not affected by Invisibility:
* Worn [[armor]] (including [[horse armor]], [[wolf armor]], and [[nautilus armor]])
* Held [[items]]
* [[Particles]] being emitted (including particles from the Invisibility effect)
* [[Fire]] from entities set on fire
* [[Arrow]]s and [[bee]] stingers stuck in players {{Only|JE}}
* A [[shulker]]'s head (whether opened or closed)
* [[Carpet]]s equipped to [[llama]]s and [[trader llama]]s
* [[Saddle]]s equipped to [[pig]]s, [[strider]]s, [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[camel]]s, [[Nautilus|nautiluses]], and [[zombie nautilus]]es
* [[Harness]]es equipped to [[happy ghast]]s
* The aura of a [[charged creeper]]
* The eyes of [[spiders]], [[cave spiders]], [[endermen]], [[phantoms]], and [[creaking]]s
* The eyes and wind effects of [[breeze]]s

Chests on [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[llama]], and [[trader llama]]s are not rendered when the host mob is invisible.<ref>{{bug|MC-279508}}</ref>

=== Mob detection range ===
When a player is under the Invisibility effect, the distance at which mobs detect the player is much shorter. After detecting a player, the mob behaves as if the player did not have the Invisibility effect; hostile mobs follow and attack the player until the player is outside of the mob's normal detection range.

A mob's detection range is determined by the {{code|[[Attribute#follow_range|follow_range]]}} attribute. When a player does not have any items equipped in armor slots (including [[elytra]]), the player is detected at 7% of a mob's normal detection range.

When a player has items equipped in armor slots, the detection range is 17.5% times the number of pieces of armor. With 4 pieces of armor, the player is detected at 70% of a mob's normal detection range.

Invisibility stacks with other methods of reducing a mob's detection range:
*[[Sneaking]] reduces detection range to 80% of the normal range
*Wearing the corresponding [[mob head]] reduces detection range of [[skeletons]], [[zombies]], [[creepers]], and [[piglins]] to 50% of the normal range. Mob heads are worn in an armor slot, and result in a larger detection range than not wearing the mob head.

The exact numerical information is in the table below:

In addition:
* [[Sculk sensor]]s, [[warden]]s, [[cat]]s, and [[villager]]s behave as though the invisible entity were visible.
* [[Pillager]]s point their crossbows at invisible players outside their reduced detection range, but they don't attack.

=== Locator bar ===
The waypoint of a player affected by Invisibility is not shown on other players' [[locator bar]]. {{IN|java}}, this is done by applying a 100% reduction on the <code>waypoint_transmit_range</code> [[attribute]].

== Immune mobs ==
[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Invisibility.

== Trivia ==
* Players in [[Spectator]] mode see invisible [[entities]] as translucent instead.
* {{IN|je}}, Invisibility prevents the rendering of entity hitboxes by pressing {{key|F3+B}}.
