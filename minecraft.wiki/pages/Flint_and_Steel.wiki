'''Flint and steel''' is a [[tool]] used to create [[fire]] or to ignite certain blocks, structures and mobs.

== Obtaining ==
=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|flint-and-steel}}

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|Iron Ingot
|Flint
|Output=Flint and Steel
|type=Tool
}}

== Usage ==
=== Igniting ===
When {{control|used}} on the space above any solid top surface, on any side of any flammable block or any side of any [[obsidian]] block within a valid unlit [[nether portal]] frame regardless of if there is a solid top surface available, the flint and steel places a [[fire]] there.

Flint and steel can be used to light unlit [[campfire]]s, [[candle]]s and [[cake|cakes with candles]].

Flint and steel can be used to light [[nether portal]]s, as any fire existing within an appropriate [[obsidian]] frame is instantly replaced with [[nether portal block]]s that occupy the entirety of the frame. Flint and steel ''cannot'' light [[end portal]]s.

Using flint and steel on [[TNT]] ignites it. The explosion damage dealt by TNT ignited with flint and steel in this specific way counts as the player's attack. If the player is {{Control|sneak|text=sneaking}}, a fire is instead placed on the side of the [[TNT]] the flint and steel was used on.

A flint and steel can be used on a [[creeper]] or [[charged creeper]] to force it to explode. Explosions initiated in this way cannot be cancelled.

When powered, a [[dispenser]] containing flint and steel can place fires or ignite relevant blocks such as [[TNT]] or [[Campfire|campfires]] in the space directly in front of it. This reduces the flint and steel's durability. A [[dispenser]] containing a flint and steel cannot detonate creepers.

=== Breaking tool ===
{{exclusive|bedrock}}
The flint and steel is considered as a breaking tool; It loses 2 [[durability]] points when it is used to break a block with a value of [[hardness]] more than 0.<ref name="MC-61176">{{bug|MCPE-61176}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The name "Flint and Steel" may be misleading as there is a lack of steel in the game and is instead crafted with [[iron ingot|iron]].
* In real life, the steel piece is called a {{W|fire striker}}. Before the invention of steel, iron minerals were also used as material for the fire striker, though it was less effective.
* In [[Adventure mode]], flint and steel cannot light fires, nor can it ignite nether portals (unless it has the tag <code>CanPlaceOn:obsidian</code>). However, it can still ignite TNT and creepers.
