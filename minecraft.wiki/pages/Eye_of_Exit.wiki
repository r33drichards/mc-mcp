The '''Eye of Exit''' is an item exclusively present in [[25w14craftmine]] on Java Edition, replacing the [[Eye of Ender]] in that version.

== Obtaining ==
The player is given an eye of exit upon revisiting a mine they have archived in a [[mine revisitor]], of which instead teleports them to the hub instead of locating the nearest mine exit.

}}

== Usage ==
When used in the current mine, the player who threw it gets damaged (unless they have the perk that disables this effect) and it leads the player to the nearest mine exit, similar to an eye of ender.

The item cannot be thrown during a mob wave, yet still damages the player unless they have the 'pathfinder' upgrade.

When used in a previous mine, the player is instantly transported back to the Hub without taking damage.

Like an eye of ender, it has a 20% chance to break after throwing.
