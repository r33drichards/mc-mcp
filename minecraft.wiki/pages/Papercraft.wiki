In April 2013, the toy manufacturer Jazwares from Florida, USA, received the licensing rights from [[Mojang]] for ''Minecraft'' figures, plush toys and craft sheets called papercraft.<ref>http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/jazwares-build-minecraft-toys</ref>

The papercraft craft sheets contain creatures and blocks. No scissors or glue are needed for assembly, because the parts are pre-punched and can be easily plugged together. Additional stickers are used to decorate the blocks or for items outside the building. Some sets include tape to glue multiple blocks together, if you want to. On the back of the packaging, it is listed exactly which and how many creatures and blocks are included.
