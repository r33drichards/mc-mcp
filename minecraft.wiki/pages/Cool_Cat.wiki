'''Cool Cat''' is a character appearing in the [[Randy Peters Minecraft advertisements]], helping promote various Minecraft products as a comedic foil to [[Randy Peters]].

== Appearance ==
Cool Cat is a mysterious yet humorous character, depicted wearing a business suit and the head of a [[creeper]]. The tuxedo is a warm gray, accompanied with an orange necktie and periwinkle undershirt. The creeper head is a popular piece of ''Minecraft'' merchandise, with the black sections serving as vision holes.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.entertainmentearth.com/product/DS161929|title=Minecraft Anniversary Creeper Block Head Roleplay Mask|author=Minecraft Disguise Roleplay|website=Entertainment Earth}}</ref>

== Personality ==
Cool Cat is a comically silent, deadpan character. Their role is to help deliver or showcase various products, however unlike professional presenters they appear to have some form of agency. In ''LOSE THE SPOON'', they are shown circling around a table of ''Minecraft'' themed ''Go-Gurt'' products, and later in the video framed as a luddite still using a spoon over a Go-Gurt. In the same video, a potentially courageous or cowardly sign is shown to them, as they are shown to have an interest in skateboarding. However, the [[Editor (character)|editor]] also claims that they are replaced by a stunt double in this shot.
