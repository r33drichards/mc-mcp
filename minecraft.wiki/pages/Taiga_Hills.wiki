The '''taiga hills''' was a hills variant of the [[taiga]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition.''

== Description ==
Like all other hills biomes, taiga hills featured more elevated and hilly terrain, with sharper inclines and more overhangs than the regular taiga, but were identical to them in every other aspect. [[Village]]s and [[pillager outposts]] didn't generate in this biome{{only|java}}, though [[wolves]] and [[fox]]es still spawned.

== Mobs ==
Taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as taigas.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
