'''2.2.2529''' ([[wikipedia:Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), '''2.2.2530''' ([[wikipedia:MacOS|macOS]]), or '''2.2.2528''' ([[wikipedia:Linux|Linux]]), is an update to the [[Minecraft launcher|launcher]] released on March 25, 2021 which adds <code>--disableGPU</code> and <code>--debugGPU</code> command line flags and makes managing the user's profile easier like changing name or skin.

== Additions ==
* Added <code>--disableGPU</code> and <code>--debugGPU</code> command line flags.
** <code>--disableGPU</code> disables GPU acceleration when running ''Minecraft''
** <code>--debugGPU</code> shows a window that gives information about the current display settings
* Added a Manage Profile menu item (if ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' is owned) that redirects to the [https://minecraft.net/profile user's profile page] at the Minecraft Website.
** It should also make it easier to manage the user's Minecraft Profile (such as changing name) if using a Microsoft Account.

== Changes ==
* MSA sign in window will now automatically be closed when the main launcher window is closed.
* Tweaked the search bar in installations to look the same as on other pages. The button to add a new installation has moved down a bit.
* Improved the login screen for languages that have long text strings.
* Highlighted notes are now only shown in a timed interval. "Two games, one Launcher" is thus no longer shown.
* Hidden at the end of the official release notes is a message reading "ᔑ ̇/𝙹ꖎ𝙹ℸ ̣ ꖎᓭ ᔑ∷ᒷ リ𝙹ℸ ̣  ∴⍑ᔑℸ ̣ ℸ ̣ ⍑ᒷ|| ᓭᒷᒷᒲ", directly translating to "Axolotls are not what they seem".

== Fixes ==
* Fixed an issue where the launcher would lose track of the Dungeons installation and ask for a fresh installation when data already exists on the disk.
* Fixed an issue where the installation button for dungeons could become unresponsive.
* Fixed an issue where Pause and Cancel buttons may be missing after uninstalling and then reinstalling Minecraft Dungeons.
* {{Bug|MCL-17216}} - Window insides keeps shrinking now its transparent.
* {{Bug|MCL-16924}} - Page change animation is not played after switching between Settings tabs for the first time.
* {{Bug|MCL-17255}} - <code>.minecraft</code> can no longer be a symlink.
