[[File:Version History - Bedrock.png|thumb|All versions of ''Minecraft: [[Bedrock Edition]]'' as of mid November 2025.]]
This page is a reverse chronology of all updates released for {{BE}}. ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition'' has been in development since August 16, 2011, and was called ''[[Minecraft: Pocket Edition]]'' at the time. ''Bedrock Edition'' was in [[Bedrock Edition Alpha|Alpha]] until November 18, 2016, when the game was fully released. Upon the release of [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0]], the "''Pocket Edition''" subtitle was dropped and the edition was unofficially (officially since June 7, 2022) dubbed "''Bedrock Edition''". Further updates have been released ever since, the most recent being {{v|bedrock}}.
