An '''End rod''' is a decorative [[light]] source that emits white [[particles]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
End rods can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] by any [[tool]] or by hand, and drop themselves when broken. They also drop as an [[item (entity)|item]] when [[water]] flows over them or when [[lava]] flows over them {{in|java}}.
{{breaking row|End Rod|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
End rods generate naturally all over [[End cities]]. They may spawn upright on the outside of towers, and they may spawn sideways inside of towers.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting 
|B2= Blaze Rod
|B3= Popped Chorus Fruit
|Output= End Rod, 4
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
[[File:EndRodPositions.png|thumb|right|End rods in various positions on [[purpur block]]s.]]

End rods are primarily used as light sources and decoration. They can be placed on any surface of any block, including other End rods. They do not break if their supporting block is broken. Gravity-affected blocks like [[sand]] or [[gravel]] do not break if they fall onto an End rod oriented vertically, but they do break on a rod oriented horizontally. End rods can be pushed and pulled by [[piston]]s, no matter the orientation.

Inside some End city towers, they are positioned so the [[player]] may use them to climb the tower, similar to a spiral staircase.

=== Light ===
End rods emit a light level of 14 (equal to [[torch]]es), melting [[snow layer]]s and [[ice]] within a 2-block radius.

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the end rods emit colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#da73de}}. This causes the bottom part of the block to render a small square shadow.

== Trivia ==
* While an End rod cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear like a unicorn horn. This can be done with the {{cmd|item replace}} command.
