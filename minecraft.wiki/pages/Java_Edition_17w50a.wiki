'''17w50a''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on December 11, 2017<ref>{{snap|17w50a|December 11, 2017}}</ref>. This is the final snapshot released in 2017.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
* Added a new local coordinate type in commands using <code>^</code>.
** When specifying coordinates in a command, the [[player]] can now use <code>^</code> to specify local coordinates instead of world coordinates.
** The axes used for local coordinates are relative to the rotation of the executing entity.
** Like world coordinates, they are measured from the base of an entity.
** The syntax is: <code>^left ^up ^forwards</code>
** <code>left/up/forwards</code> is the amount of blocks in the specified direction.
** For example, typing {{cmd|setblock ^ ^ ^3 stone}} in chat sets a stone block 3 blocks in front of the player in their view.
* Tab-completing coordinates when not targeting a block suggests <code>~ ~ ~</code> again.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the default tags <code>wooden_buttons</code> and <code>wooden_doors</code> for both items and blocks.
* The tags <code>buttons</code> and <code>doors</code> now include <code>stone_button</code> and <code>iron_door</code> respectively for both items and blocks.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Ender chest]]s'''
* Now change their texture when the computer time is set to the 24th to 26th of December to suit Christmas.

'''[[Item frame]]s'''
* Can now be placed on the top and bottom of blocks.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Can now include other tags (of the same type).
** The player can add for example <code>#foo:bar</code> in a tag value list to reference another tag called <code>foo:bar</code>.
** Self-referencing is not possible.
* When overriding a tag, the player can now choose to replace instead of append.
** By default all tags append if another data pack created the tag.
** Adding <code>"replace": true</code> to the tag definition makes that tag replace existing tags instead.
* When used in commands, block tags now support block state and data tag arguments.
