'''''Minecraft: Xbox One Edition''''' is the {{el|lce}} version of ''[[Minecraft]]'' developed by [[4J Studios]] and [[Mojang Studios]] for the {{w|Xbox One}}.<ref>[[4J Studios]], [{{tweet|4JStudios|370111405216649216}} "Happy to confirm we're developing Minecraft PS3, PS4 & PS Vita Editions for Mojang, as well as Xbox 360 & Xbox One Editions!"], ''Twitter'', 2013-08-21.</ref> It was announced on June 10, 2013 at Microsoft's press conference at {{w|Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|E3 2013}} and was available for purchase on the Microsoft Store for US$19.99 between September 5, 2014 and September 20, 2017.<ref>[http://ign.com/videos/2013/06/10/minecraft-xbox-one-edition-reveal-trailer-e3-2013-microsoft-conference "Minecraft: Xbox One Edition Reveal Trailer - E3 2013 Microsoft Conference"], ''IGN'', 2013-06-10.</ref> Existing digital owners are still able to access, re-download, and play this version. A retail version was released on November 18, 2014 and can still be purchased. DLC for the game is still available on the Microsoft Store. Like the [[Nintendo Switch Edition|''Nintendo Switch'']] and [[PlayStation 4 Edition|''PlayStation 4'']] editions players, the ''Xbox One Edition'' owners had the option to download the [[Bedrock Edition|Bedrock]] version for free, however this deal ended in December 2019.

Compared to the {{el|360}}, the ''Xbox One Edition'' features [[world]] sizes up to 5120×5120 blocks (36 times larger), native 1080p resolution, 18 [[chunk]] [[render distance]], [[amplified]] worlds, 16 player multiplayer for [[mini games]], and the option to constantly save the world in the background akin to the ''[[Java Edition|Java]]'' and ''[[Bedrock Edition|Bedrock]]'' Editions. 

Initially, the ''Xbox One Edition'' was planned to no longer receive updates following the release of {{BE}} on the platform, starting with the lack of an equivalent update to [[Xbox 360 Edition TU58|TU58]]. However, the ''Xbox One Edition'' later received [[Xbox One Edition CU50|CU50]], an update adding the MINECON Earth Skin Pack, and eventually resumed updates entirely with [[Xbox One Edition CU51|CU51]], an update equivalent to [[Xbox 360 Edition TU60|TU60]] which also added all the features from [[Xbox 360 Edition TU58|TU58]], Xbox One Edition continued updating for 2 years after the release of {{BE}}.

As of [[Xbox One Edition CU59|CU59]], the ''Xbox One Edition'' has not received new feature updates, such as the [[Update Aquatic]], [[Village & Pillage]], [[Buzzy Bees]], the [[Nether Update]], [[Caves & Cliffs]], and so on.<ref>{{Mcnet|update-aquatic-coming-legacy-console-editions|Update Aquatic Coming to Legacy Console Editions}}</ref> The ''Xbox One Edition'' is playable on the {{w|Xbox Series X and Series S|Xbox Series X&#124;S}} via backward compatibility.<ref>https://xbox.com/games/store/-/BT6HNJH658C6</ref>

The ''Xbox One Edition'''s most recent feature update is the [[World of Color Update]].

== Controls ==
{{main|Controls#Legacy Console Edition}}
In default settings, the [[controls]] are always displayed on the [[Heads-up display|HUD]]. The controls for ''Xbox One Edition'' are similar to {{el|360}}.

== Gameplay ==
The game is similar to {{el|360}}, but supports the enhancements offered by the Xbox One. Worlds from {{el|360}} can be transferred using an Xbox Account, but currently cannot be loaded on the ''Xbox One Edition'', as {{el|360}} has [[Update Aquatic]], while the ''Xbox One Edition'' does not.
