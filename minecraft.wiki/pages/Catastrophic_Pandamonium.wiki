'''Catastrophic Pandamonium''' was a limited time [[Marketplace]] map developed by [[Gamemode One]] that promotes the [[Holiday Update]], featuring a story that involves a crisis wherein pandas go missing. At some point it was delisted.

== Summary ==
The map opens with the player in a moderately sized info room, with a fountain, a sculpt of a face with [[block of emerald|emerald]] eyes, and several [[maps]] in [[item frames]]. To the back of the room is a copy of the map's key art, to the sides are promotions for Gamemode One's [https://x.com/gmodeone Twitter] account. Climbing up stairs behind the key art leads to several pens, where many [[pandas]] sleep, with a [[chest]] full of [[bamboo]] and [[raw cod]] at the end. Advancing beyond that leads to  an exhibit area, the Jungle Safari, where the player meets a zookeeper, introducing to all the pandas: Loaf, Sniffles, Baby, Rascal, Chicken, Bellicose, and Mahogany. After explaining their personalities, they instruct the player to sleep.

Climbing up into a nearby [[jungle]] treehouse, players will find two [[cats]], red and persian, and four green [[beds]]. Upon waking up, the zookeeper will discover that the pandas have escaped thanks to a blackout, begging the player for help locating them. There are two ways out of the panda exhibit: to the right of the door is a [[dispenser]], which gives [[iron armor]] "in case of pandamonium," while to the left are several [[horses]], already equipped with [[saddles]]. Nearby is a directory, which gives directions to every area the pandas have wandered off to, each color coded.

=== Moody Marsh ===
Color coded lime on the directory but green in practice, Moody Marsh is found on the same path as Creepy Caverns, splitting off at a [[rose bush]] garden. The building is primarily made of [[jungle wood]], with awnings made of jungle [[planks]] and [[granite]], hanging [[oak trapdoor]]s, and [[banners]] spelling out the attraction's name. To the left is a large gift shop filled with empty [[stairs|shelves]] and banners, with [[terracotta]] walls, an interior stage, and a cash register represented by [[stone brick stairs]]. The entrance is marked by several [[crafting tables]], with the zookeeper another room over.

Upon entering, the zookeeper explains that the storm that released the pandas is looping, thanks to lightning frying a circuit, which is scaring Chicken. In order to save them, the player must locate a control room and deactivate the thunder, while evading [[slimes]]. Chicken is sitting scared inside of a [[swamp]] biome, surrounded by [[spruce]] walkways that circle over to several buildings. Going straight from the right leads to a vacant building with three [[creepers]], one charged, and a [[zombified piglin]]. On the left path players will reach a [[witch hut]], with another zookeeper saying to check "the place where [[lightning]] strikes twice." 

This turns out to be an area on the left path, with [[fire]] perpetually burning a spot made of [[black concrete powder]], reachable by a [[ladder]]. Approaching it reveals a hidden entrance to a room made of [[blocks of quartz]], with [[bookshelves]], [[smooth stone slabs|potted]] [[leaves|plants]], and what appears to be a monitor made of [[blocks of iron]], [[iron trapdoor]]s, and [[black concrete]]. At the end is a [[lever]], which can deactivate the [[thunderstorm]], marked by a dynamic [[sign]]. On the opposite side of that area is a British Shorthair cat playing on [[pressure plates]].

Upon solving the lightning situation, Chicken can be brought back to the zookeeper using bamboo, and whisked away back to safety.
=== Creepy Caverns ===
Color coded green on the directory but lime in practice, Creepy Caverns is accessed by climbing up a large increase into a [[cave]], where a zookeeper will explain that Baby climbed into a gap. Venturing into the cave, players will immediately find a [[monster room]], partly [[mossy cobblestone wall|walled]] off but reachable by stairs, spawning several [[zombies]]. Beyond that is a [[spring]], opposite to it a [[mineshaft]] [[rail]] with Baby trapped behind [[cobblestone slabs]]. Not far from that is another mine, identifiable as tied to the previous through the use of [[stained glass]] to block entrance, near a [[lava]] downpour and [[obsidian]] in front of [[scaffolding]]. Climbing down the scaffolding shaft will lead deeper into the mineshaft, with a [[TNT minecart]] surrounded by displays of [[ores]].

The goal of the area is to push the minecart up to the debris, where it will detonate a hole big enough to free Baby. Upon being released, Baby can be led back to the zookeeper, who will return to the Jungle Safari.
=== Hostile Horrors ===
Color coded red, Hostile Horrors is a [[sandstone]] building with a warm color scheme, featuring raised roofs similar to [[end cities]] and opposite of a [[parrot]] sanctuary. The zookeeper explains that a panda ran inside Hostile Horrors, a place full of so many "hostile monsters" that even its keeper is scared to enter. Inside the building are displays of [[skeletons]], [[creepers]], [[blazes]], and zombies, contained inside of [[acacia]] boarded observatories. Bellicose can be found at the very end, hiding behind an [[armor stand]] holding a [[diamond sword]].

Upon approaching her<!--Bellicose is referred to as her early on-->, the monsters will sprout from the exhibits and begin attacking. Using the sword, the monsters can be defeated. As with the other pandas, Bellicose will have to be led to the entrance using bamboo, which is made harder by the presence of enemies.
=== Cactus Valley ===
Color coded orange, splitting off the path to Hostile Horrors, Cactus Valley is marked by a granite and [[oak wood]] gate. Entering the area will reveal it's set in a [[badlands]] biome, explaining that Sniffles ran off into the "desert." In order to find him, the zookeeper suggests following a trail of [[slime ball]]s. The path begins to the left of the zookeeper, the right is a secondary exit that loops into Moody Marsh. The trail of snot leads to a directory, before the player encounters a [[husk]] upon reaching a cave with a [[dark oak]] skull looming above. Players can exit the cave by climbing up onto a railway platform, leading to an otherwise unreachable crafting table and two [[anvils]], with a balcony.

Exiting the cave, players will arrive at a shooting gallery, with an adjacent armor stand holding a [[bow]] and a chest with nine stacks of [[arrows]]. In order to advance, players must shoot four [[birch button]]s on a [[desert pyramid]], activating [[redstone lamps]]. Upon shooting four, a [[fence]] will disintegrate. The pyramid can be accessed by dropping down into a hole marked by scaffolding, launching upwards using a [[slime block]]. Instead of the traditional pit with [[TNT]], Sniffles is stuck in a hole also marked by scaffolding. In order to free him, players must craft a slime block, and place it on a [[sticky piston]].

Instead of trekking back to the start, Sniffles merely needs to be taken to a zookeeper outside the temple, remarking that "the two of you had quite the adventure." Players can return to the entrance using a minecart after Sniffles leaves.
=== Iceberg Island ===
Color coded light blue, splitting off the path to Cactus Valley at a series of [[bush]]es and [[stairs|benches]], Iceberg Island is led up to by two separate stairways with a directory in the middle. Similar to Moody Marsh, there are two gift shops near its premises, with noticeably poor lighting. The one to the left sells banners and stained glass, while to the right is one with two floors infested with husks. Closer to the area is a similar building, however it appears to be more of a lounge or cafe, with bookshelves and couches, and a [[jungle log]] table. Opposite to that is a parkour challenge, where players can platform up several piked planks to reach a tuxedo cat.

The proper entrance to Iceberg Island is marked by [[spruce]] trees, with the zookeeper explaining that Rascal has gone out into the icebergs to "play with the [[polar bears]]." Now, thanks to the blackout, they can't reach him, so the player has to use scaffolding to activate a rooftop generator. The scaffolding is to the zookeeper's right, past several [[quartz stairs]] and [[smooth stone]] bleachers. Once the player reaches the top, they must platform across several scaffolds over into a second building, encountering two [[drowned]]s. After bypassing or defeating them, the player returns to the roof of the first building, where the generator can be activated, marked by a lever on orange concrete.

After activating the door to the island, players can advance onto it, an [[ice spikes]]-like area. Rascals lies in the center, near a chest of supplies, and can be led back with bamboo. To do so, players must follow a path of white concrete powder discs, first found in the back of the area Rascal plays in. After evading innately hostile polar bears, Rascal can be escorted.
=== Treetop Walkway ===
Color coded purple, Treetop Walkway opposes the rest of the paths, going backwards from Jungle Safari into a [[bamboo jungle]]. At the top of a hill are more gift shops, along with several shops, one containing a cat and polar bear with a [[melon]]. In the entrance area, other biomes can be glanced at, including a [[flower forest]] with [[llama]]s, a [[taiga]] with [[wolves]]. The zookeeper can be found at the bottom of a stairway next to the logo, explaining that Mahogany climbed up a tree, angering several wolves, and they don't know how to get him down. The zookeeper then suggests using scaffolding, which can be claimed from an infinitely restocked chest.

The rest of the section is set on treetop platforms built into [[fancy oak]]s, with scaffolding beams missing between each. Once a gap is filled, Mahogany will automatically progress to the next platform. Once Mahogany is rescued, the zookeeper will praise the efficiency of scaffolding. In the area where the player ends up, there is a staff building, with multiple floors and [[tripwire hooks]] on the wall.
=== Jungle Temple ===
Once all the previous pandas are found, a narrating zookeeper will establish that Loaf is still missing, having checked the entire premises. It turns out he was inside the Jungle Safari the entire time, specifically the player's cabin. Once he is found, the doors to a temple are opened, resembling a [[jungle pyramid]] but with added [[end rods]] and [[skeleton skull]]s. Additionally, the player is given a goal of taming all 47 cats within the map.

Inside the temple, there are several displays, including explanations of the mobs introduced in the Holiday Update, demonstrations of scaffolding's properties, and a [[shulker box]] autofarmer using bamboo as fuel.
