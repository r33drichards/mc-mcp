'''Large Biomes''' is a [[world type]] that [[world generation|generates]] Overworld worlds at a higher scale than in normal worlds. It does not affect Nether biomes at all.<ref>{{bug|MC-172228|||WAI}}</ref>

== Generation ==
[[File:Large Biomes Button.png|250px|right]]

Large Biomes worlds generates Overworld biomes with much more expansive and larger climate zones compared to default worlds at approximately 4 times the scale. Even with using the same seed, the climate zones do not match that of default worlds due to multi-noise parameters used to generate worlds since 1.18. Large biomes does not change the size of mountains or rivers compared to default worlds. As such, there are often larger clusters of mountain biomes that generate within each biome.

The player can use a [[map]] to gain a visual representation of the scale of the biomes in their world.

Large Biomes offer a play experience different from regular sized worlds. If a player starts in an undesirable area, such as a desert, it can be difficult to survive. The generation system also leads to rare biomes being far more difficult to come by, but with more valuable resources when they are eventually found.

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w19a|Large Biomes introduced.
|Large Biomes worlds were generated as Default worlds, but had 16 times as much area (multiplied by 4 along the X and Z axis), causing the [[biome]]s of the [[Overworld]] to be expansive. A Default and Large Biome world sharing the same [[Seed (world generation)|seed]] were geographically the same, overall. [[River]]s were not larger than they were in a default world.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.18|dev=Experimental Snapshot 1|Large biomes worlds can no longer be created.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=21w39a|Added large biomes for custom worlds.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Pre-release 1|Large biomes worlds can be created again. 
|Because of the multi-noise parameters used to generate biomes as of 1.18, Large Biomes terrain is no longer geographically consistent with the Default generation using the same seed.}}

== Trivia ==
* The scale of biomes can be altered through the {{cd|firstOctave}} parameters in {{cd|biome_source}} of [[Custom]] worlds. Decreasing each {{cd|firstOctave}} by 2, roughly makes biomes have a similar size to Large Biomes. This affects the {{cd|temperature}}, {{cd|vegetation}}, {{cd|continentalness}}, and {{cd|erosion}} parameters. Conversely, increasing all 4 parameters by more than 2 creates a more rugged terrain.
* The Legacy Console Edition added a biome scale slider in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU54|TU54]] with a "large biome size" option. This differs from large biomes on ''Java Edition'' by a scale factor of 4x smaller biomes on Legacy Console. This is due to Legacy Console Edition's default generated worlds using small biomes with 4x smaller biomes compared to default worlds on ''Java'' and ''Bedrock'', and "medium sized biomes" 2x smaller than ''Java''/''Bedrock''.
