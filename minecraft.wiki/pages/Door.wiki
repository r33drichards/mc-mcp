== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Doors must be supported by a full solid block face beneath them. The bottom half of the door is placed where the player is aiming, with the top half extending one block above. If there is not enough space for the door, or not an appropriate supporting block underneath the base, no action is performed.

==== Facing direction ====
When placed, a door occupies the side of the block closest to the player, or behind the player if placed in the player's own space.

==== Hinge placement ====
When placed, a door checks the blocks to its immediate left and right and uses the following rules to determine hinge placement:
* If another matching door is adjacent, with its handle side touching the newly placed door, a double door forms. This causes the new door to have its handle touching the existing doors handle, with hinges opposite. 
* If there is no other matching door present, the hinge is placed on the side with the highest number of adjacent solid block faces. 
* In [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']], if there are no blocks adjacent, or both sides fulfill a single other rule, the hinge is placed on the side closest to the players aim.

=== Behavior ===
[[Water]] and [[lava]] flow around doors. 

[[Mob]]s can spawn in a space occupied by a door.

The sound of opening and closing of a door can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most mob sounds.

When placed using the {{cmd|setblock}} command, only one half of a door is placed, because doors are actually two separate blocks. The lower half still works, but with graphical bugs, and the upper half does not. Redstone cannot be used because it updates the half, breaking it. The upper half does not drop anything when broken, the lower half drops a normal door. This implies that the upper half is dependent on the lower.

=== Barrier ===
A door can be used as a switchable barrier to entity movement. Although primarily used to block movement by mobs and players, a door can also be used to control the movement of boats (for example, a door placed in a two-wide water flow stops a boat when perpendicular to the flow, but allow it to move again when parallel), items and minecarts (a door can stop a falling item or minecart, then allow it to drop again when the door moves), etc.

{{IN|Java}}, doors provide a breathable space if placed underwater. {{IN|bedrock}}, doors in water source blocks are [[waterlogged]] and do not displace water source blocks.

Doors are 0.1875 ({{frac|3|16}}) blocks thick (0.1825 {{in|bedrock}}). The rest of a door's space can be moved through freely. A door occupies two block spaces and both halves normally act as a single barrier, although doors can be opened or closed with a player or mob occupying the bottom block of the door,<ref>{{bug|MC-54255||You can stand on the bottom block of a door, allowing you to climb it like a ladder|WF}}</ref> in which case the player can jump up to land on the bottom half of the door and then again to land on top of the door.

=== Air pockets ===
Doors can be used as air pockets underwater in ''Java Edition'' as doors cannot be waterlogged. This method cannot be used in ''Bedrock Edition'' as doors can be waterlogged. In both editions, doors can be used to create air pockets in [[lava]]. Because there is no [[air]] around the door, wooden doors do not [[burn]].

=== Fuel ===
Similar to [[planks]], [[Wooden Door|wooden doors]] can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnaces]].

[[Wooden Door|Overworld wooden doors]] ([[oak|oak door]], [[spruce|spruce door]], [[birch|birch door]], [[Jungle tree|jungle door]], [[acacia|acacia door]], [[dark oak|dark oak door]], [[Mangrove|mangrove door]], [[Bamboo|bamboo door]], and [[Pale oak|pale oak door]]) can '''smelt 1 [[item]] per''' '''door.'''

However, [[Wooden Door|Nether wooden doors]] ([[crimson]] and [[warped]]) and metal doors ([[Iron Door|iron]] and [[Copper Door|copper]]) cannot be used as [[fuel]].
