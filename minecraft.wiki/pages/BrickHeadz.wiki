'''''Lego'' ''BrickHeadz''''' is a ''[[Lego]]'' theme of stylized statues in the image of characters, typically in the form of pop culture characters. Among the licenses featured in the series is ''[[Minecraft (franchise)|Minecraft]]''.

== Set information ==
''BrickHeadz'' are similar to a ''{{Wikipedia|Funko Pop}}'', being a small collectible with a comically large head. ''BrickHeadz'' differ, being made in the ''LEGO'' system, with different options for alternate builds and accessories. Characteristic of the line are the proportions; the head and body being roughly the same size and cubic shape, with "cutesy" black dots for eyes. Unlike typical depictions of the characters, the ''Minecraft'' figures have round pupils represented by a 1x1 circular tile, much like other ''BrickHeadz''. Only [[creepers]] use a square tile for the eyes, fitting the game's art style.
