'''15w32b''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on August 6, 2015<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/08/minecraft-snapshot-15w32a/</ref> to fix some bugs and crashes from [[15w32a]], along with adding and changing some features.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Scoreboard]]'''
* Added {{cmd|scoreboard}} <code>players tag ...</code>
** Players can add and remove tags for any entity based on NBT data of that entity/player.
*** For example {{cmd|scoreboard players tag @a add test {OnGround:0b} }} adds the tag "test" to all players that are in the air.
** Tags can be accessed by using the parameters after the selector; {{cmd|give @a[tag{{=}}test] stone 1}} gives 1 stone to all players that have the tag "test".
** Players can use {{cmd|scoreboard players tag <player> list}} to see what tags are on an entity (Note that in this current version, players can't use tab to get "list").
** Tags are stored in the playerdata file as strings, not in the scoreboard files.
*** This means that any tag the player binds, has to be bound to an existing online player or an existing entity.
*** Unlike objectives, tags cannot be displayed on the sidebar or anywhere else.
**** Only via the list subcommand can you see which tags an entity has.
* Added three new objective types: [[XP]], [[hunger]] and [[Damage#Drowning|oxygen]].
** "xp" can be used to track the players exact amount of XP points.
** "food" can be used to track the hunger level of the player (ranges from 0 to 20).
** "air" can be used to see for how long the player has been underwater.
*** Starts at 300 (out of water) and then decreases 1 per tick as long as the player's head is underwater (resets when the player exits the water).
*** The [[Water Breathing]] effect freezes the timer and the [[Respiration]] enchantment slows down the countdown each time more with each level.

'''World selection screen'''
* Now displays a thumbnail per world showing a glimpse of the world (it takes a screenshot when player has just created or opened it for the first time in this snapshot or higher).
** When the world hasn't been opened in snapshot 15w32b or before, or if the game couldn't make a screenshot thumbnail, a gray-scale image is displayed.
** The thumbnail is saved in the world folder under <code>.minecraft/saves</code> with the name "icon.png".

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
[[File:Ender Dragon.gif|width=64x64]] '''[[Ender Dragon]]'''
* Now flies over the portal and dies if the final hit is applied elsewhere.

[[File:Shulker JE1 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Shulker]]'''
* No longer teleport by themselves if <code>NoAI</code> is set to 1.
* Can now be teleported using {{cmd|tp}} or {{cmd|spreadplayers}}.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Entity tags now work on [[spawn egg]]s.
** The corresponding mob spawns with the assigned tags.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative inventory]]'''
* Removed [[arrow of Splashing]].

=== General ===
'''World selection screen'''
* The exclamation mark from last snapshot, indicating that the world has not been played in the current snapshot yet, is now shown on top of the thumbnail.
** It also warns if a world was played in a newer version of Minecraft before, telling the player that the world may corrupt, if they open it in an older version.
*** The version number now displays in red if it has been played in a newer version before.
* The player can now click the play arrow on the thumbnail, just like a server, to open the world.
