'''The First Night''' is the premiere episode of [[Minecraft Mini-Series|''Minecraft Mini-Series'']].

== Summary ==
[[CommuniKate]] introduces the show by introducing herself, traveling across a [[Rail|railway]], the [[Birch Forest|forest]] by [[horse]], and [[Ocean|sea]] on [[boat]]. In each location, Zed suffers an injury. Upon reaching a desired spot in the forest, she uses a [[Command Block|command block]] to spawn the teams and explains the objective of the game, as Zed hands out marked [[Map|maps]]. Immediately, conflict brews as [[Quinn]] discovers that her belongings were withdrawn by CommuniKate, In spite of this, [[Durango]] remains excited and runs off to fulfill his greed.
	
	[[Rudi]] asks [[Sacha]] to craft a [[bed]], who hesitates before a [[creeper]] attacks them. Meanwhile, [[River (Character)|River]] helps a sheep down from an [[andesite]] ledge. As the focus returns to Team Tundra, they engage in hunting down a [[chicken]], as Rudi discovers a [[Birch Island#Mineshaft|mineshaft]]. Unfortunately, as CommuniKate eagerly points out, the sun is setting on the island, as a [[skeleton]] appears to try killing Rudi and Sacha.
	
	The scene cuts to [[Toby]], trying to punch down a [[birch]] with his fists, collecting his tenth [[Log|birch log]]. Using the wood source, Quinn crafts several ladders. However, several [[Zombie|zombies]] appear, Quinn sarcastically asking if Toby invited them, leading to a confused back and forth where he thinks she was being serious. Climbing up into a cave with the ladders, Team Stone Beach escapes.
	
	Meanwhile, River and Durango are wandering through the woods, struggling to see anything. In spite of several monsters appearing, Durango runs casually. River ends up trying to fight the incoming zombies with a wooden sword, but can only bring herself to waggle it. After killing a skeleton, Durango is trampled by several zombies, seguing into the first interview segment of the show where he claims he "saw [them] coming!" They ultimately manage to escape the zombies by hiding in a hole under the [[Grass Block|grass]].
	
	In the morning, the contestants begin to emerge from their hiding places. Team Stone Beach slept in a cave. Team Tundra boarded up the mineshaft. Team Mooshroom hid inside a [[huge mushroom]]. Durango digs his way out of the [[dirt]], apparently using his head, as does River and her head. Team Woodland emerges from out of nowhere, their solution to the nighttime problem unclear, and strike a conversation with Team Tundra. River begins wondering if the reward would be a [[poppy]], Durango disagrees saying it must be [[Gold Ingot|gold]] or [[steak]] or "steak served on [[Block of Raw Gold|gold]]." However, he quickly notices that they've reached the destination, rushing up to a Sanctuary on the [[Birch Island#Beach|beach]].
	
	Having won the challenge, CommuniKate congratulates Team Mesa, mistaking them for Team Woodland. Coming in at second place is Team Mooshroom, Slugger sliding in on her face, and gets yelled at for thinking she won. After being handed their [[Gold tools|rewards]], CommuniKate makes it clear that this was all only the first of several challenges, as the weight of what she's done to the contestants sets in. All they've done is give Team Mesa five points. CommuniKate proceeds to promise "everything you want!" as she reveals the Sanctuary is full of [[Glazed Terracotta|valuable]] [[Melon Slice|objects]], before promptly destroying it. As the episode wraps up, CommuniKate gives them the new objective of preparing for the rest of what's to come, as Sacha chases after another chicken, as does Durango.

== Trivia ==

* Sacha's quote "don't axe don't tell" during the conversation with Vin is a reference to the controversial {{Wikipedia|Don't ask, don't tell|"don't ask, don't tell"}} policy employed by the United States government, which discouraged harassment towards non-heterosexual service members while also disbarring any from openly serving.
* CommuniKate's vulnerable fear of chickens is foreshadowed/established by her jumping away from one at the end of the episode.
* When the episode was released, a link to it was released on [[Minecraft.net]], disguised as an article.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://minecraft.net/en-us/|title=Official site|website=Minecraft.net|date=July 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170717225944/https://minecraft.net/en-us/}}</ref>

=== Errors ===

* While trying to survive, Durango uses a wooden sword to block, and before that Zed's boat breaks into several pieces. These mechanics had been removed prior to the video releasing, as well as before it was conceived.
** In the same scene as the sword block, a skeleton drops a bizarre looking bow, seemingly displaying several frames of animation overlaid on top of each other.
*The "rewards" at the end of the episode consist of then-normal looking [[Golden Sword|golden sword]] and [[Golden Axe|axe]], and corrupted textures for [[Golden Shovel|golden shovel]] and [[Golden Pickaxe|pickaxe]]. In the second shot featuring the items, the axe is also messed up.
