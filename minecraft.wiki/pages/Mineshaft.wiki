'''Mineshafts''' are underground [[structure]]s primarily found underground in the [[Overworld]]. They consist of interlinked 3×3 tunnels with incomplete [[rail]] lines running through them, with [[planks|oak wood]] platforms bridging gaps or hanging in larger exposed caverns. Mineshafts are the only structures where [[cave spider]] [[monster spawner]]s can be found.

A unique variant of mineshafts made out of [[dark oak]] wood can generate on the surface in [[badlands]] biomes.

== Generation ==
Mineshafts generate underground in any Overworld [[biome]] except for the [[deep dark]] (although a mineshaft can overlap). They generate before [[chunk]] features such as [[ore]]s. Multiple mineshafts can generate near each other, producing larger complexes. When mineshafts intersect with [[cave]]s and [[canyon]]s, corridors generate a bridge of [[planks]] over empty space, either suspended with [[iron chain]]s above or supported by [[log]] pillars below. When a mineshaft intersects with an [[aquifer]], a barrier of solid blocks generates to prevent fluids from flowing into the mineshaft, often resulting in corridors cut off from the rest of the mineshaft.<ref>{{bug|MC-214787|||WAI}}</ref>

Mineshafts often generate on the surface in [[badlands]] biomes. Badlands mineshafts are composed of dark oak planks and [[fence]]s with railways more complete above ground. Since badlands biomes generate [[gold ore]] often and at higher altitudes, they are good places to easily find gold.

Mineshafts are the most common generated structures in the Overworld, having a 0.4% chance to attempt to begin generating in every chunk.

[[File:Minecart with chest in mineshaft.png|right|thumb|A minecart with chest in a mineshaft.]]
[[File:MineshaftRoom.png|thumb|The central room of the mineshaft.]]
[[File:21w07a Mineshaft.png|thumb|A mineshaft generating across a large cave.]]

All mineshafts have: 
* '''Starting point:''' a 10×10 parlor, with an arched ceiling and one to four exits in each direction.
* '''Corridors:''' some 3×3 tunnels and junctions are supported by [[planks]] and [[fence]]s. Some places are decorated with [[torch]]es and [[cobweb]]s. On long corridors, these supports are placed four blocks away from each other, while some have missing planks which may be filled up with cobwebs or blocks of [[stone]] jutting out from the top. The tunnels are connected by incomplete rail systems on the ground, upon which [[minecarts with chest]]s generate uncommonly. Cobwebs do not generate if they would not be connected to solid blocks, while corridors generate with [[log]] pillars, [[iron chain]]s, and fences for support if they are in mid-air.
* '''Crossings:''' dual-floor, 5×5 intersections supported by wooden columns.
* '''Staircases:''' diagonal tunnels, [[stairs]] blocks are not used.
* '''Abandoned passageways:''' accessory corridors with numerous [[cobweb]]s concealing [[cave spider]] [[monster spawner]]s.

Any chest found in a mineshaft always occurs as a [[minecart with chest]] that rests on top of some rails.
