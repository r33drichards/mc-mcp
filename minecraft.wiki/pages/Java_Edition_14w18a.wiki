'''14w18a''' is the twentieth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on April 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425132002/https://mojang.com/2014/04/minecraft-snapshot-14w18a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w18b|date=April 30, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Piston]]s and [[slime block]]s'''
* Slime blocks now push and pull blocks adjacent when connected to sticky pistons.
** Connected to normal pistons, slime blocks only push blocks, but don't pull them.
** Up to 12 slime blocks connected to a piston in any arrangement can be moved as long as the following conditions are met: blocks do not disrupt the chain, non-moveable blocks are not in the way and slime blocks are not attached to the piston itself.
** Follows all the rules that pistons follow, for example, blocks which can normally be moved by pistons can be moved if attached to slime blocks.
* Extending a piston with a slime block on top of it launches the entity (mobs, players, items, launched arrows, etc.) into the air.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|461473908420796416|I don't think anyone has found it yet, so I'll go ahead and spoil it: Standing on a slime block that gets pushed up is lots of fun.|April 30, 2014}}</ref>

'''[[Torch]]es'''
* Can now be placed on [[stained glass]].
