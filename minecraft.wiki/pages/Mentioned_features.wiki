[[File:Sky Dimension 1.jpg|thumb|The [[sky dimension]], one of many mentioned features.]]
Since the beginning of ''[[Minecraft]]'''s development, there have been a number of features that were mentioned by developers at [[Mojang Studios]]. These features are either currently planned and have not yet appeared in a development version or have simply been dropped entirely.

Note that this page only documents features that were mentioned, but are not yet in the game. Features in development versions are described on the parent version page.
== Planned ==
=== Announced ===
These features are planned to come to ''Minecraft'' sometime in the future.

==== Combat changes ====
{{main|Java Edition Combat Tests}}

A new combat system is currently in development, containing changes such as the player only being able to attack when their weapon is fully drawn. However, as of 2026, the latest combat test is [[Combat Test 8c]], which was released in August 2020.

==== Illager variants ====
In 2017, a jocular suggestion regarding adding more types of [[illager]]s was posted. One of them, the pillager, has been implemented in [[Village & Pillage]]. The spin-off game {{MCD}} introduced many such {{MCD|Illager|illagers}}, such as {{MCD|enchanters}}, {{MCD|Geomancer|geomancers}}, and {{MCD|Wind Caller|wind callers}}. One of them, the {{MCD|iceologer}}, was an option in the Mob Vote at ''[[Minecraft Live 2020]]''. In 2024, an episode of [[The Story of Mobs]] implied that even more illagers were planned.<ref>{{YouTube link|BkbE7jf--2s|Easter Eggs Behind The...Sick Villagers?|Minecraft|October 27, 2024}}</ref>

==== Voted updates ====
The [[desert]] and [[savanna]] biome reworks are the two remaining biome frameworks from the ''[[MINECON Earth 2018]]'' [[Biome Chooser]] vote. Although no date has been given, both are promised to be updated in a future update:<ref>{{reddit|9gl167/biome_chooser_announcement_trailer|e650hxt|It will not be like last year where one biome gets updated but the rest don't- instead the vote is just choosing which biome will get updated first but all of those biomes will get updated.|HelenAngel|September 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|_LadyAgnes|1173997560308129792|We haven't forgot about them :)|Sep 17, 2019}}</ref>

* Deserts will be given palm trees, oases, and meerkats.
* Savannas will be given baobab trees, termites, and ostriches.

The [[badlands]] biome rework is the last remaining biome rework from the ''[[MINECON Live 2019]]'' [[Biome Vote]], as the winning mountains rework was implemented in [[Caves & Cliffs]], and the swamp rework was part of [[The Wild Update]]. The badlands are promised to be updated in an unspecified future update:

* Badlands will be given vultures, tumbleweed, and a new cactus based on the [[wikipedia:Opuntia|Prickly Pear]].

Other live votes did not promise that the losing options would be planned; for information on those features, see the "[[#Partially implemented|Partially implemented]]" section.

=== Mobs ===
==== Mob Vote ====
{{Main|Community Vote}}

==== More ocean creatures ====
Markus Persson commented that sea monsters were a possibility on Minecast on July 21, 2010.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/116353-minecraft-facts-big-list-of-what-notch-has|title=Minecraft FACTS: Big list of what Notch has ACTUALLY said.|author=Obsidian Miner|website=Minecraft Forum|date=October 4, 2010}}</ref> He particularly noted the possibility of sharks, though Mojang has since then stated that they will not be added.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360005029872-Previously-Considered-Suggestions</ref> At [[MinecraftCon 2010|''MinecraftCon 2010'']], he also commented on the possibility of adding sea monsters.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/818408-minecraftcon-2010-which-one-for-friday-less-than-9|title=MINECRAFTCON 2010 WHICH ONE FOR FRIDAY? less than 9 hours|author=Diamond Miner|website=Minecraft Forum|date=July 16, 2010}}</ref> Hostile aquatic mobs like the [[guardian]] and [[drowned]] have been added since then. Another developer hinted about adding mobs involved adding seals/sea lions and/or orcas.<ref>{{tweet|The_T_Pearson|972881498943574016|who knows what the future may hold.|March 11, 2018}}</ref>

==== Zach and Coco ====
In November 2018, a poll was held in which users could vote on which cat should be added to ''Minecraft''. There were three options: Jellie, Zach, or Coco.<ref>https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1059491029261283330</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1063522092057067521</ref> Jellie won the vote and was added to the game in [[Village & Pillage]].<ref>https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1063522133593260032</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1064548266472280065</ref> It is unknown whether the other two cats will be added.

=== Blocks and items ===

==== Spike block ====
Spikes received a mention in mid-2009 by Notch in a blog post.<ref name="tiles">{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603201943/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/110762705/my-list-on-tile-types-so-far|title=My list on tile types so far|website=Tumblr|author=Notch|date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> These were originally planned for {{verlink|Java Edition Beta 1.7}},{{citation needed}} working by extending and retracting spikes (and making them more "spike pistons" than anything),{{citation needed}} but were replaced by [[sticky piston]]s.{{citation needed}} On May 28, 2012, Nathan Adams stated that he'd like to add spike blocks, but is unsure of how to implement them.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|207253374230470657|I want to add them, I'm just not sure how they'd look or function that best suits the game|May 28, 2012}}</ref>

Caves & Cliffs implemented [[pointed dripstone]], which can damage mobs and players that fall on them, or are crushed by them.

==== Ruby ====
[[File:Villager trading preview.png|thumb|Jeb's screenshot showing rubies.]]
[[Rubies]] were intended to be the original currency used for [[trading]]. They could be seen in a screenshot released by [[Jeb]] on May 21, 2012,<ref>https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/204619936616808451</ref> in which the trading system was first being tested. They were later replaced by [[emerald]]s because [[Nathan Adams|Dinnerbone]] is colorblind; though their texture remained in the files after emeralds were implemented.

==== Paeonia ====
[[File:Paeonia First Image.jpg|thumb|The paeonia screenshot revealed by Jeb on Instagram.]]
The [[paeonia]] was a [[flower]] type originally planned for implementation in [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]]. Originally revealed by [[Jeb]] in a screenshot,<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/dE8ljlJMLb/ "I've been adding a bunch of new flowers to #minecraft. One of them is the pink Paeonia, as it was the main flower for our wedding"] – [https://www.instagram.com/jebkhaile/ @jebkhaile], August 16, 2013</ref> the flower was never implemented, being superseded by the [[peony]], though its texture remained in the files after peonies were implemented.

==== Paddle ====
On September 19, 2014, [[Tommaso]] stated that when adding [[boat]]s to ''Pocket Edition'', he would add a "paddle" item,<ref>{{tweet|_tomcc|512936498946387968|@Sean_MCPE they'll be bigger and I think will require 5 logs instead of 5 planks, plus a Paddle item.|September 19, 2014}}</ref> which would be required to move boats.<ref>{{tweet|_tomcc|512936645700878336|@LarryBi63052484 I think in the end it will be a Paddles item or something, but yes, it's needed to move at all.|September 19, 2014}}</ref> Paddles were never implemented as items, but rather as part of the boat model. The crafting recipe used to require a [[wooden shovel]] to represent the paddle. As of the [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.10|1.20.10]] update, a wooden shovel is no longer required to craft a boat or raft {{in|be}}.

==== Rare tools/weapons ====
Nathan Adams said on Twitter he would like to add weapons/tools that cannot be crafted, and could only obtained through treasure chests/trading, etc. For example, bows with faster drawback (somewhat implemented with the addition of [[Quick Charge]]), boots that increase health, or night vision helmets. However, the attribute system had to be finished first.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|440462447846371328|One thing I'd really love to add into Minecraft is special weapons/tools you can find exploring or trading, that aren't normally obtainable.|March 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|440462568109641728|Like a bow that has faster drawback, for example. But the attribute system needs so much work first!|March 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|440463320739758080|That's what I'm thinking, finding boots that increase (or maybe even decrease!) health - special and unique stuff|March 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|440465480525291520|The idea is these kind of things will be passive "buffs" that things can give you|March 3, 2014}}</ref>

Several later additions that follow this rough idea are the [[Frost Walker]] and [[Mending]] treasure enchantments, as well as the Curses of [[Curse of Binding|Binding]] and [[Curse of Vanishing|Vanishing]], and [[totems of undying]]. Furthermore, [[trident]]s were implemented in Update Aquatic, and in the Nether Update the [[Soul Speed]] enchantment was added and made exclusively obtainable through looting [[bastion remnant]]s and [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s. In the Wild Update, [[Swift Sneak]] was added as an enchantment exclusive to [[ancient cities]], and Tricky Trials added the [[mace]], as well as making tridents available in [[vault]]s, along with the [[Wind Burst]] enchantment being exclusive to said vaults.

==== Steel ====
Multiple references to [[steel]] were made early on in the game's development. Notch had stated that it could be made using [[coal]] and [[iron ore]],<ref name="tiles" /> and that it could be used for armor and weapons more powerful than iron.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429224451/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/123343045/my-vision-for-survival|title=My vision for survival|website=Tumblr|author=Notch|date=June 14, 2009}}</ref> In-game, [[flint and steel]] is crafted using iron ingots, considering the lack of steel and the need of a “fire striker”, despite the name of the former.

=== Mechanics ===

==== Farming nerf ====
Somewhere in 1.16{{citation needed}}, developers stated that certain changes would be made to functionality exploited in several farms. In particular:
* Fortress mobs can spawn anywhere inside of the boundary of a Nether fortress rather than only at the roads.
* Angry [[zombified piglin]]s drop experience even when not killed by the player directly.
** This was fixed in 1.21.5.

The [[sculk]] mechanics introduced in 1.19 may be intended as a replacement.

==== Sky dimension ====
{{main|Sky dimension}}
[[File:Sky Dimension 2.jpg|thumb|A plain sky dimension.]]

The Sky dimension was a planned dimension, intended to be the opposite of [[the Nether]]. Portals to the Sky dimension were never implemented, but it could be accessed using third-party programs. The idea was ultimately scrapped<ref>{{tweet|notch|71249283520802817|And because PC Gamer made such a big deal of the sky dimension, I guess I'll have to finish it. Consider it confirmed.|May 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|KavmNrLtdso|Notch Answers Minecraft 1.8 Questions - Community Questions for Markus (Notch) Persson|OmniTechNews|September 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|jeb_|124201530856452096|It has been rebranded to be The End realm|October 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|notch|134609813299671040|Probably, yes. :D I love the idea. The Ether mod does it great, try it.|November 10, 2011}}</ref><ref name="JebUnplannedJuly2012">{{tweet|jeb_|219758430276173824|No we don't plan to return the Sky Dimension|July 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name="DinnerboneUnplannedJuly2012">{{tweet|dinnerbone|220109988100710400|We have no plans to revisit the skylands|July 3, 2012}}</ref> and its code was reused to make [[the End]], which can be seen in versions prior to [[14w17a]] as [[The End (biome)|the End's technical biome]] was still referred to in the [[debug menu]] as "Sky".

Unlike the Sky dimension, the End has a dark purple sky, no clouds, and the floating islands are made entirely of End stone.

With the addition of the [[buffet]] functionality in [[Java Edition 1.13]] snapshot [[18w15a]], this can be distantly recreated by using the "Floating Islands" option. The addition of [[custom world generation]] in [[Java Edition 1.16.2]] snapshot [[20w28a]] also included a {{cd|minecraft:floating_islands}} noise preset offering similar functionality.

Additionally, the Sky dimension was independently recreated into the popular Aether mod.

==== Updates to birch forests and other biomes ====
At ''[[Minecraft Live 2021]]'', it was stated that [[The Wild Update]] would focus on biome diversity and immersion, giving a unique identity and atmosphere to different biomes. The [[birch forest]] was used as an example to demonstrate this new atmosphere, and concept art pieces depicting an improved birch forest with new flowers and shelf fungi were shown. Also shown was [[swamp]] concept art with fireflies and  flowering lily pads.

Later it was stated that "concept art is not a commitment" and that this part of the update was now "not something we have continued working with" in an Ask Mojang episode.<ref name="why" />

The short flowers and fireflies were later implemented in [[Spring to Life]] as [[wildflowers]] and [[firefly bush]]es. The bracket fungi, tall flowers and water lilies are yet to see an implementation.

}}
Some of these features have either partially or entirely been added, but are still marked as "under review".

== Delayed or scrapped ==
These features were initially promised to be implemented in a specific update, but were later postponed and have not currently been made part of another update.

=== Alpacas ===
In 2016, Jeb was planning on adding alpacas, but due to other developers wanting [[llama]]s instead, he held an informal poll on Twitter in which the public voted on adding the llama over the alpaca.<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-llama|Meet the Llama|April 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|jeb_|757952180146012160|A friend is in urgent need of your help to settle this matter|July 26, 2016}}</ref>

=== Colored Planks{{Anchor|Colored wood planks}} ===
[[File:Colored Wooden Planks.png|thumb|Original image of proposed colored wood planks released by Nathan Adams.]]
{{main|Colored Planks}}

Nathan Adams briefly thought about implementing colored wood planks, releasing a test image on his Twitter page. This however never got implemented, as can be seen from the following quotes. The idea was eventually replaced with [[stained terracotta]].

=== Cubic chunks ===
This refers to changing the [[chunk format]] to make [[chunk]]s 16 blocks tall, allowing for infinite world height. [[Ryan Holtz]] discussed it with [[Erik Broes]], but they decided they couldn't implement it, because of the difficulty of solving problems such as the occlusion of sky light.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/27ibll/mogminer_infinity_years_until_cubic_chunks/ci1c6q0/</ref> The feature was previously rejected by Notch for similar reasons.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kq89v/cubic_chunks_increases_the_performance_of_the/c2me2bz/</ref>

=== Coral slab ===
[[File:SeaPlantsMineConEarth2017.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of the footage in which coral slabs can be seen.]]
In early footage of the [[Update Aquatic]] seen at [[MINECON Earth 2017]], slab forms of [[coral block]]s can be seen generated as part of [[coral reef]]s. These never made it into a released version for reasons unknown.

=== Fletching table functionality ===
[[Fletching table]]s are set to gain functionality in a later update, similar to what happened with [[smithing table]]s (originally added as a generic villager job site block and then received player functionality in a future update). Originally, this was planned for "the next major themed update".<ref>{{snap|19w11b|March 12, 2019}}</ref> Later, it was stated that functionality wasn't a guarantee for 1.16.<ref>{{tweet|MiaLem_n|1178624224090558464|Not in 1.15 and I can't promise anything for 1.16 either I'm afraid.|September 30, 2019}}</ref> Later, it was confirmed that fletching tables wouldn’t be gaining functionality in 1.16.<ref>{{tweet|HelenAngel|1251376297630003200|No. We will not be adding functionality to the fletching table in 1.16}}</ref> To this day, they still have no functionality beyond serving as the workplace block for fletcher villagers.

=== Firefly mob ===
{{main|Firefly (mob)}}
[[File:Firefly (mob).gif|right|width=129x129]]
Fireflies were originally going to be eaten by [[frog]]s to produce [[froglight]]s, but this was scrapped due to the fact that some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life.<ref>{{ytl|a5Wd9ciTmTI|Minecraft Now: Frog February!|Minecraft|Feb 10, 2022|t=544}}</ref> They would have glowed in the dark and been two pixels in size, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. It was officially confirmed that they were scrapped for the 1.19 update in an Ask Mojang episode.<ref name="why">{{ytl|ixSlQXDOvkM|Ask Mojang: What happened to the fireflies in Minecraft 1.19?|Minecraft|May 10, 2022|t=98}}</ref> It was later implemented in the form of a [[particle]] generated by [[firefly bush]]es in [[Java Edition 25w05a]], rather than as a mob.

=== Green axolotl ===
This mob was seen at Minecraft Live 2020 as part of the [[axolotl]] announcement. The mob was presumed to be added in the [[Caves and Cliffs]] update, but wasn't added alongside the other axolotl colors shown. They also later appeared in the update trailer despite not actually existing in the game.

=== Pigman bodyguard ===
[[File:Pigman.png|thumb|150px|The original pigman texture.]]
Development of a male mob which may have had no clothes was also mentioned by [[Dinnerbone|Nathan Adams]] in 2012,<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|235000878841606144|Coding some new mobstuffs. This is hilarious. He has no clothes! :(|August 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|235322386730328064|Working on a very old but popular minecraft suggestion that keeps popping up every so often; I put my new mob on hold for now.|August 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|246757052750364673|@123sendodo No. I've shelved that mob for now.|September 14, 2012}}</ref> but this is not currently being worked on. On April 14, 2020, Nathan Adams clarified that the mob was going to be a [[pigman]] bodyguard, which was naked by default so that the player could provide armor for it.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|1250295957075292160|It was going to be a type of pigman that you could convince to fight for you, like a bodyguard. The reason it had no clothes was that I wanted the player to be responsible for what it wore and what weapons it used, but that logically meant naked mob by default :D|April 14, 2020}}</ref>

=== Quiver ===
The [[quiver]] was an item briefly present in [[indev]] versions of the game while items were being tested. Its texture came from Notch's previous [[Legend of the Chambered]] games, and remained in the files for many years afterwards.

During the development of [[Java Edition 1.9]], [[Dinnerbone]] posted a 2×204960 image on Twitter<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|595224755126534144|The following picture is meaningless and is probably not even worth your time clicking on it.|May 4, 2015}}</ref> which could be reformed into a 854×480 Minecraft screenshot, clearly depicting the quiver as a usable item in the inventory, where it had what seemed to be a dedicated slot alongside a slot for [[arrow]]s.<ref>{{reddit|34too2/nathan_adams_on_twitter_the_following_picture_is|cqxxz2i|context=0|It's not meaningless.|FiredPlayer (now deleted)|May 4, 2015}}</ref> He shared another screenshot of the quiver in the inventory a few weeks later, with the quiver slot in a different location.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|601714812436029440|I also had to rearrange the Creative inventory a little, too, to make the new slots fit. I don't think it's too bad.|May 22, 2015}}</ref> On June 30, 2015, Dinnerbone stated that he scrapped quivers as he felt that holding arrows in the off-hand felt "more natural."<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|615853908553019393|I'm removing quivers again. Arrows in off-hand feels more natural.|June 30, 2015}}</ref>

=== Sculk jaw ===
This block was seen at [[Minecraft Live 2020]] as part of the [[deep dark]] announcement. Walking on it would change its texture, and it is presumed that it would do damage to the player and that it could be broken with the [[hoe]] like with other sculk blocks.

The block was presumed to be added in [[The Wild Update]], but [[kingbdogz]] revealed that it was unlikely to be added in the final release.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1431995233936494594|Sculk Trap (which is actually called Sculk Jaw) is unlikely to make it into the game, wasn't very happy with its design Sculk Shrieker is a completely different block|August 29, 2021}}</ref> In the end it was not added.<gallery>

=== Red dragon ===
{{main|Red Dragon}}
[[Markus Persson]] initially mentioned wanting to add dragons. After implementing the [[ender dragon]], he said that he wanted to also add a friendly, red dragon to the [[Overworld]]. However, there are no current plans of adding the second dragon.

== Mentioned ==
These features were mentioned at one point, but later abandoned or their current status is unknown. Note that some of these features were mentioned by developers who either no longer work at [[Mojang Studios]], or no longer work on ''Minecraft''.

=== Mobs ===

==== Camouflaging mob ====
A mob which camouflages with its environment was a concept considered by Jens Bergensten when designing the [[shulker]], which was originally one of the mob's mechanics during development - the mob would camouflage with the surroundings, but due to difficulties with the code and rendering, he decided to abandon this element of the mob. He stated however that it may happen in the future.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3vjmzCV8PY&t=12m17s "MINECON 2015 Upcoming Features"] – [https://www.youtube.com/user/TeamMojang Minecraft], July 30, 2015 – via YouTube</ref>

==== Lava zombie and troll ====
Before the implementation of [[hostile mob]]s, Notch stated that he liked the idea of monsters such as lava zombies or troll infestations, which would roam the land and break things. Later, the [[zombie]] was implemented.<ref>{{citation|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg215704#msg215704|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=Tigsource|date=June 17, 2009}}</ref>

==== Prefix mobs ====
Notch mentioned prefix mobs in a Brocraft stream. He gave examples of mobs such as "Burning Spiders, Giant Zombies, and Cobble Creepers." Some prefix mobs have been added in the form of cave spiders, charged creepers, strays, bogged, husks, drowned, and other mob variants. Giant zombies have technically been added, but are currently unused. In the [[Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34|3D Shareware April Fools update]], the ORDER.txt jokingly mentions "11 new enemy variants including Buff Crepper and Evilshroom II" for a fake game: "MineCraft 3D: Deeper and darker."

==== Reindeer ====
Reindeer were another mob acknowledged and suggested initially for Christmas 2015.<ref>{{reddit|2p65gp/my_3d_animated_reindeer_for_minecraft_what_do_you|cmugdaj|Next xmas?|jeb_|December 14, 2014}}</ref> {{MCE}} version 0.6.0 added the [[MCE:Jolly Llama|Jolly Llama]], which is supposed to represent a reindeer. It is currently unknown if reindeer will ever be added or not.

=== Biomes and environment ===

==== Cave and underground features ====
Many features relating to the underground and caves have been mentioned historically, but are yet to be seen in-game. Some suggestions which were approved by Mojang include rainbow crystalline caves<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108050113/http://getsatisfaction.com/mojang/topics/rainbow_crystalline_caves_and_how|title=Rainbow Crystalline Caves and how|website=Mojang Get Satisfaction|date=February 7, 2011}}</ref> and cave maps, considered "an interesting idea" by Notch.<ref>{{Tweet|notch|63302622949552128|@OhHaiMe It will not update if you leave the map area. It only maps the top level now, but cave maps is an interesting idea..|April 27, 2011}}</ref>

==== Seasons ====
Nathan Adams mentioned on Twitter that he was experimenting with adding seasons, and varying the length of day and night according to season. He also mentioned it during [[Minecon 2013|''Minecon 2013'']].<ref>{{tweet|dinner|323870260560293888|Here's one thing I've been tinkering with but not added yet: Minecraft day cycles (potentially seasons). 500 days in a year, shorter nights?|April 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinner|336123928181346306|It was never said to be for 1.6 :)|May 19, 2013}}</ref> Seasons may include changes in color of tree leaves and may also be tied to real time.<ref>{{twl|38120314|t=06h17m17s}}</ref> The later released ''Minecraft Dungeons'' has a location called [[Pumpkin Pastures]], which resembles an autumn-themed forest biome. Autumn-colored trees also appear in [[MCL:Forest|forest biomes]] in ''[[Minecraft Legends]]''.

==== Nether features ====
Multiple features relating to the Nether have been proposed and acknowledged, such as utilizing the space above the Nether ceiling for something else,<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|251057506686730240|@crash_nick Likely not, but I was considering reusing that space for something else!|September 26, 2012}}</ref> non-rectangular Nether portals,<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|377489959810498560|This feels too cliche...|September 10. 2013}}</ref> and Nether portals placing players in front if possible.<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73504?focusedCommentId=224785&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-224785 "For 1.8.4 this will be fixed just by keeping the player in the portal block, but this is not ideal and it should make sure we can place them outside if it's a "preferable" spot (ie: not a drop into lava). This will be fixed fully in a later release."] – Dinnerbone, April 17, 2015</ref>

During the development of the [[Nether Update]], other ideas were discussed, such as dyeable Nether portals, which were dismissed as not being priority by Jeb.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|1228220678517604354|We are not planning to add that|February 14, 2020}}</ref> As a joke feature in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]], funky portals were added and would change color depending on the text data found in a [[written book]].

=== Blocks and items ===
====Scarecrows====
Scarecrows were mentioned multiple times. In [[Minecraft: The Story of Mojang]], Jeb mentioned the possibility of a scarecrow crafted using a pumpkin, wool block and 3 sticks, which would attract monsters.<ref>{{ytl|xdoH3kzg938|(Official) Minecraft: The Story of Mojang (Pt. 2/2) - Proof of Concept for Feature-Length|2PlayerProductions|February 20, 2011|t=198s}} – February 20, 2011</ref> He brought this up again later in a reddit comment, stating "The reason I haven't added it already is that the mob AI assumes the target is an entity, and not a world block. I would either have to make the scarecrow an entity, or allow mobs to target blocks."<ref>https://www.reddit.com/comments/fgogh/_/c1fth3u/</ref>  [[Armor stand]]s would later be added as a stationary entity with a similar appearance to a scarecrow. Village & Pillage added [[pillager outpost]]s, which can generate a scarecrow-like target structure. [[Zombie]]s can pathfind to turtle eggs in order to break them, showing that block targeting is possible to some extent.

====Calamari====
Jeb stated after the addition of pumpkin pies that "only mutton and calamari are missing",<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|245503714167750656|After this I think only mutton and calamari are missing: http://i.imgur.com/6jd6q.png|September 11, 2012}}</ref> implying mutton and calamari were both planned additions. [[Mutton]] was indeed added a few updates later, while squids are yet to drop any form of meat.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===

==== Blaze3D ====
A new ''Java Edition'' rendering pipeline called Blaze3D has been confirmed many times by [[Searge]].<ref name="broken menu">{{tweet|seargedp|1149269708065124352|I'm also excited to show the first update to our world selection screen.

==== Full split of liquids from blocks ====
[[File:Waterless World 1.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Waterless World 2.jpg|thumb]]
[[Java Edition 1.13]] added [[waterlogging]], marking the start of the separation between liquids and blocks. An in-development screenshot showing water occupying [[leaves]] and [[flower]]s, referred to as having "no water blocks", was released in 2018.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|988712909315493888|I should start a blooper twitter account. In other news, there is no "minecraft:water" blocks in this world - and that's why trees and flowers are taking a bath.|April 24, 2018}}</ref> However, water and lava still currently exist as blocks, and so far only water sources can occupy other blocks through the waterlogged block state; flowing water and bubble columns cannot occupy other blocks, and both still and flowing lava cannot occupy other blocks at all.

Having water only occupy one side of a block like a [[glass pane]], but not the other, is also something that has been considered.<ref>Replying to "will you be able to place water in only 1 side/quarter of glass panes?": {{tweet|Dinnerbone|971793252658679808|One day, maybe! Not right now though sorry.|March 8, 2018}}</ref>

==== Phasing out of NBT-based crafting recipes ====
In [[Java Edition 1.14]], numerous new blocks were implemented as replacements for certain "complex" crafting recipes, with the replaced crafting recipes relying on NBT data. This included moving inventory tool repair to the [[grindstone]], banner modification to the [[loom]], and map modification to the [[cartography table]]. However, several more NBT based crafting recipes still exist (such as fireworks, dyeing leather armor and tipped arrows), and these are planned to be phased out.<ref>{{link|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/9rpbvc/a_separate_crafting_block_used_to_make_fireworks/e8lgp1r|title=We actually already have ideas for a block like this, but it's not likely to be done for this update sorry! We're trying to move all "complex" recipes out of the crafting table and into a specialized mechanic, as it's basically impossible to teach players about banner patterns or fireworks charges. Thanks for the ideas! <3|date=October 28, 2018|website=Reddit|author=/u/Dinnerbone}}</ref> Certain blocks that may be added in the future to further this goal include a dedicated fireworks customization block.

In [[Java Edition 1.14.3]], tool repair crafting recipes were reimplemented.

[[Java Edition 1.20.5]] adds [[data components]] to replace the non-strict item NBT format, all item data is still stored in NBT but uses a stricter way to access the data to keep the data structure consistent.

==== Shaders ====
On the feedback site, shaders (resource packs that override the vanilla shaders) were marked as announced, meaning that they were going to be implemented. This feature was partially implemented in [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]] and [[Java Edition 1.17|1.17]], as resource packs can enable similar effects.

While core shaders can be modified with resource packs, this is not considered a supported feature by Mojang. Different methods to change the game's graphics to the extent that overriding core shaders allows may be implemented at some point.<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w34a</ref>

However, Mojang developers are planning on implementing their new shader pack, Vibrant Visuals, into {{JE}}.

==== Super Fancy graphics ====
Docm77 confirmed in a tweet that sometime in the future, a new graphics setting will be added to Minecraft called "super fancy". It is unknown whether it is the "Fabulous!" graphics setting added in [[Java Edition 1.16 Pre-release 1]], [[Vibrant Visuals]] {{upcoming}}<!--do NOT remove this upcoming tag until VV is released for Java!-->, or another new one. The use of OpenGL 3.2 for rendering in [[Java Edition 1.17]] may lead toward the Super Fancy graphics. This could also be a reference to the [[Ray Tracing]] functionality {{in|Be}} or the scrapped [[Super Duper Graphics Pack]].<ref name="summit">{{tweet|docm77|1001763772111958016|There will be a new grafics setting in Minecraft. There will be a "fancy" and "super fancy" setting. Also the combat system will get an overhaul. #MinecraftCreatorSummit2018|May 30, 2018}}</ref>

==== Inventory changes ====
An inventory rewrite was originally added in the snapshot [[14w07a]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], but a roadblock was hit and Mojang had to shelve the change before the release of 1.8.<ref>{{reddit|31z5gz/dinnerbone_working_with_inventories|cq6k74n|We never finished that. We hit a roadblock with the inventory rewrite, and had to shelve it because we couldn't figure out how to proceed nicely.|Dinnerbone|April 9, 2015|context=2}}</ref> Other changes to the inventory have been mentioned, including spectators being able to look at other's inventories, visible health/armor bar on all players,<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|428550337126232064|I'll add that, but no promises it'll be done for this weeks snapshot|January 29, 2014}}</ref> seeing players' GUI when spectating from their POV<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|428490039446999040|Okay, I decided not to do "spectating through other players eyes shows you their UI" because that's a little hard right now. :(|January 29, 2014}}</ref> and the return of shift-double-clicking.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|433591349150253057|Yeah, that should be trivial to add in properly now!|February 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|1xpfhq/twitter_dinnerbone_implementing_the_actual|cfdtg8w|It's a pain in the ass to test though! Rather pushing the limits of what we're mocking sofar, planned to implement for tomorrow :)|_Grum|February 12, 2014}}</ref>

==== Lua scripting ====
{{w|Lua scripting}} was a feature mentioned by Notch as a way to create server-side modifications.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118194757/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/140842759/throwing-in-many-more-hours-and-survival-mode|title=Throwing in many more hours, and survival mode plans|website=Tumblr|author=Notch|date=July 13, 2009}}</ref> The server would be able to create custom commands, assign certain server functions to blocks, and create user groups. Players would not have to download scripts within or outside of the client, and therefore no client-side modifications will be necessary. Notch said that he wanted Lua to be an extension for ''Minecraft'', but did not want Lua to turn ''Minecraft'' into a game engine.

Lua scripting has been further hinted at by [[Searge]].<ref name="broken menu" />

Certain plugins such as Spigot or Bukkit support Lua scripting implementation into servers, but these plugins are not created by nor affiliated with Mojang Studios and thus are not an official means in which to implement Lua scripting.

==== Off-hand changes ====
Changes with the off-hand slot added in [[Java Edition 1.9]] were planned on being added to Minecraft sometime in the future.<ref name="MineCon Earth">{{reddit|7dw9ea/hey_guys_i_came_second_in_the_minecon_earth||Hey guys, I came second in the Minecon Earth costume contest. I was able to ask jeb_ some questions about 1.14 and Minecon. Heres his answers!|Retro28|November 18, 2017}}</ref> Specifically, the player would no longer be able to {{ctrl|attack}} or place blocks with any item in their off-hand slot, similar to {{BE}}. However, players would still be able to hold items in the off-hand slot, which still made the off-hand useful for maps and such. Also, blocking would still be able to be activated if the player is holding a shield in their off-hand. However, this regression was later retracted due to massive community backlash.

==== World generation ====
[[File:Far Lands Experiment.png|thumb|The Far Biome.]]
[[File:Waves Dev Screenshot.jpg|thumb|Unimplemented waves effect.]]
[[File:3D Grass Dev Screenshot.jpg|thumb|Unimplemented 3D grass effect.]]
There have been a number of mentioned changes to world generation from the developers. Tommaso had planned a Far biome, which likely would have resembled a motivated alteration of the [[Far Lands (Bedrock Edition)|Far Lands]], potentially made into its own stand-alone biome. This would be found at the edge of infinite worlds, and was going to be implemented in 0.9.0. For unknown reasons, it was indefinitely delayed.<ref name="FarBiome">{{reddit|sub=MCPE|1v8ooc/whats_happening_with_old_biomes_in_090|ceq11d2}}</ref><ref name="PEPanel">{{YouTube link|opppP_RTJmo|Pocket Edition Future MINECON 2013 Panel|Minecraft|December 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Far0.9.1">{{tweet|_tomcc|462274819623772160|Actually, as we're short on time, we might add the limit in 0.9.1 and for the time being you have to live with endless worlds :P|May 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=todo>{{tweet|_tomcc|507806426040111104|My MCPE todo list used to be sorted by version, now it's just the features I'd like to have from "soon" to "maybe"!|September 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|_tomcc|488604654402830336|Meanwhile, have this screenshot of my far lands experiment!|July 14, 2014}}</ref> Tommaso also proposed a unique underworld/underground structure<ref name="exclusive">{{tweet|_tomcc|444532060687200256|I think it's pretty cool, those huge "underworlds" are scary & buildable :) But we have no time to polish them, so perhaps 9.1!|March 14, 2014}}</ref>, as well as a dream dimension<ref name="Q&A">{{twl|19541608|Minecraft: Pocket Edition & Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Q&A|Mojang|October 7, 2015}}</ref>. However, none of these ideas (with the exception of the "unique underground structure", later added as the [[ancient city]]) came to fruition.

Tommaso stated on [[wikipedia:Reddit|Reddit]] that he would like to add a numerical "difficulty" value that mobs could have depending on their circumstances (spawn conditions, weather, etc.).<ref>{{reddit|sub=MCPE|24vm8t/twitter_tomcc_minersneo_id_like_to_level_up_mobs|chb6qtr}}</ref> This would vary the amount of hostile mobs at night and the amount of resources gained from each biome. He also stated that he would like more biome-specific mobs as well as biomes with specific difficulty/mob distributions (something which has been partially implemented with more biome-specific mobs added over the last couple updates).

He also experimented with several other unimplemented world-gen related features which were either not implemented or else only implemented much later, such as much larger caves,<ref>{{tweet|_tomcc|444531310497787904|We’ll be at the GDC in San Francisco for a week! Yeah, it means no updates sadly… so have pic of a friday experiment!|March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|_tomcc|450916507199873024|I was wondering why there were no mobs around in the overworld at night...

Many of these ideas were reiterated again at [[MINECON 2016|''MINECON 2016'']], where the developers stated they could either port the world generation changes from PC (added in [[Caves & Cliffs]]) or create a new world generation altogether. They posed that this new world generation system could operate with its own form of "progression system," wherein which harder/more complex biomes generate further from spawn. Other new generation features might have included more space underground (later added in [[Caves & Cliffs]]), a rise in the sea level to Y=96, and terrain alterations which would make generated terrain less predictable (also added in [[Caves & Cliffs]]).<ref name="Minecon2016">{{ytl|ILG2fSzunJ0}}{{info needed|timestamp?}} October 21, 2016</ref>

Since the world generation got completely overhauled in [[Bedrock Edition 1.18.0]] (for the first time since [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]]), and with the new [[cave]]s, terrain port from ''[[Java Edition]]'', and the addition of [[ancient cities]], four of the aforementioned changes were/are officially added into the game, with one being only partially implemented (more biome-specific mobs).

==== Interface/controls ====
At MINECON 2016, the developers mentioned potential future improvements to the controls. This would have made the input system vector-based, allowing full mouse support on Android (added in [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.0|1.17.0]]) and having better built-in controller support.<ref name="Minecon2016"/>

In addition, at a previous panel, they also mentioned the ability to remap the "long touch" input to "hardness-based" touch (3D Touch) for capable iPhones.<ref name="Q&A"/> In other words, the input wouldn't be based on touch duration, but rather on touch intensity. 

In a Twitch stream previewing the Nintendo Switch version, the developers mentioned that they would like to look into adding motion-controlled aiming, but currently have no plans to add it.<ref>{{twl|233472107}}</ref> This kind of feature would theoretically only function on devices supporting gyro-based controls, a qualification which would make it a natural addition to a platform like Nintendo Switch, but not several others. Development on this kind of feature is likely suspended due to a lack of clear way to make it cross-compatible. 

Bluetooth keyboard and mouse support was added to iOS and iPadOS devices in [[Bedrock Edition 1.19.10|1.19.10]]<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/6465669193997-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-19-10-20</ref>

==== Other world sizes ====
Tommaso stated on Reddit that they may make other limited world sizes available, in addition to the [[Old]] world type (256×256). Mentioned world sizes were 1000×1000 and 10000×10000.<ref>{{reddit|sub=MCPE|1wxgjz/what_will_the_limited_world_sizes_be|cf7tylf}}</ref> The addition of different world sizes was again mentioned at MINECON 2016.<ref name="Minecon2016"/>

==== Loading external files on console ====
Roger Carpenter talked about this in a stream of the 1.2 beta for Xbox One.<ref>https://mixer.com/Minecraft?vod=6632210</ref> They would like for the console versions to support the loading of files from external media such as a USB stick. This would allow the use of Add-Ons, custom worlds, skins and resource packs, etcetera, like on the other platforms. However, console companies are worried about "security issues" that this could cause. Other games that loaded content from external media have sometimes been exploited by hackers to run unauthorized code on consoles. If loading add-ons from external media is not an option, they would "work it out some other way". (Partially added with full add-on and behavior packs support for Xbox One)

*'''Partially implemented:''' Megabeasts were mentioned as a potential addition for late-game challenges along with ill omens followed by "a night of absolute horror".

**The [[ender dragon]] was introduced in the Adventure Update, followed by the [[Wither]], while the [[Bad Omen]] effect was added in [[Village & Pillage]] and expanded in [[Tricky Trials]]. The [[darkness]] effect is also similar to the idea of torches flickering.

*Server-side scripting.<ref name="Notch to-do list"/>
*Land claim flags: planting a flag (possibly costs gold in Survival mode) claims an area of land. No monsters can spawn or die from age in that area, and only selected players can build in that area.<ref name="Notch to-do list"/> 
*'''Partially implemented:''' Smoke block: would be generated by fire, be passable, cast shadows, float upward and disappear after a short time.<ref name="Notch to-do list"/> 
**Village & Pillage added [[campfire]]s, which generate smoke particles similar to what was mentioned, but they are not blocks and do not cast shadows.
*Gravity; all blocks except possibly [[obsidian]] would be affected by gravity. Floating islands would need obsidian blobs to stay afloat.<ref name="Notch to-do list"/> Markus Persson later stated that he disliked the idea.<ref>{{tweet|notch|27969437402|@BIindRob no, I've stopped liking that idea.

*In-game anti-cheat; make the server check for flying, no-clip and increased speed. Add those options to the client, but only enable if the server says it's okay.<ref name="Notch to-do list"/>
*'''Partially implemented:''' Make moss grow on rock (likely means that [[mossy cobblestone]] would spread to [[cobblestone]])<ref name="Notch to-do list"/>. 
**In 1.17, [[glow lichen]] was introduced which functions similarly to the idea growing on stone in caves and spreading with [[bone meal]].

**In October, Kizzycocoa who was a wiki administrator at the time asked Notch over IRC if Herobrine would be added. Notch's response was, "i have no plans of adding herobrine as is, but I do like the rumors, haha." The "as is" part of the sentence caused confusion, so Kizzycocoa asked Notch on Twitter for a direct answer. Notch said, "i have no plans of adding herobrine."<ref>{{tweet|notch|27871748827|@Kizzycocoa i have no plans of adding herobrine.|October 19, 2010}}</ref>
