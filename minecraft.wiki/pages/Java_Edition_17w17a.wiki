*** "until" - this advancement, its parent, and its parent, etc.

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Changed and moved around many existing advancements:
** "Withering Heights" is now an offspring of "Spooky Scary Skeleton".
** "Into Fire" is now an offspring of "A Terrible Fortress".
** "Remote Getaway" is now an offspring of "Free the End", and works properly when player throws an ender pearl into the [[gateway]].
** "Sky's the Limit" is now an offspring of "City at the End of the Game", and is now a "goal" type advancement.
** "Zombie Doctor" and "Eye Spy" are now offspring of "We Need to Go Deeper".
** "Eye Spy" now requires the player to enter the [[stronghold]].
** "A Weak Brew" was replaced with "Local Brewery" (<code>nether/brew_potion</code>), which is an offspring of "Into Fire" and requires the player to retrieve any potion from a [[brewing stand]].
** Illusioner now counts for "Monster Hunter" and is required for "Monsters Hunted", which makes the advancement unobtainable.
** "Sniper Duel" not requires a skeleton to be killed.
* Advancements can now execute commands when achieved.
** The command written in the rewards section of the advancement is executed as the player (for example writing <code>/say @s</code> would be equivalent to <code>/execute <the_player_who_obtained_this_advancement> ~ ~ ~ say @s</code>)
* Advancement icons now allow data values.
** Specifically, <code>icon</code> has switched from being a string to an object.
*** Within it are a required <code>item</code> string (specifying the item ID) and an optional <code>data</code> integer, specifying the metadata of the item
* The "damage flags object" now contains two new entity objects:
** <code>source_entity</code> - specifies the "owner" of the damage that was dealt.
** <code>direct_entity</code> - specifies the direct cause of the damage.

'''[[Crafting]]'''
* Optimized the [[recipe book]].
