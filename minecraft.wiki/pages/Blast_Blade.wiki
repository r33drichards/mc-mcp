The '''Blast Blade''' (爆裂剣, ''Bakuretsu Ken'') is an exploding sword created using the Imagination [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
The Blast Blade resembles a normal sword, but with a [[Creeper]] face design embedded in its blade. The blade is also surrounded by a lighter edge.

== Functionality ==
The Blast Blade largely operates like a regular sword, allowing the wielder to slash their opponents. However, it also explodes on impact, causing damage to both the wielder and their enemy. It has a limited number of blasts, at which point it will return to the regular sword it was crafted with.
