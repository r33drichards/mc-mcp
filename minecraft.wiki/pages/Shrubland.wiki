'''Shrubland''' is a removed [[biome]] that was introduced in the [[Halloween Update]], which existed in the game prior to the [[Adventure Update]]. It was usually quite flat due to height variation decreasing at lower rainfalls. The biome was removed upon the release of [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]], as part of the update's overhaul to terrain generation.

== Description ==
The shrublands are largely identical to the savanna biome, featuring few trees and no tall grass. Along with swampland, it was one of the smallest biomes in the game, rarely being larger than a few chunks. It would only generate if the temperature was between 50% and 97%, and if the rainfall value was below 35% and therefore too little to generate a forest.
