'''13w38b''' is the sixth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], released on September 19, 2013<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w38a/</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[13w38a]] snapshot.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* "Super Secret Settings"
** Added bumpy shader.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Air]]'''
* Redefined the concept of air.<ref>{{tweet|dinner|381055646806077440|This snapshot may be very crashy because @_grum redefined the concept of "air". We're keeping an eye on the crash list though!|September 20, 2013}}</ref>
** Is now an actual block instead of the absence of a block (null).<ref>{{tweet|dinner|381056010607419392|Actually it's the other way around! :D|September 20, 2013}}</ref>
* It can be kept in the inventory. 
** When in the inventory, dropped, and inside an item frame, it uses the [[missing texture]], but when held in the player's hand, it appears entirely invisible.
* Drops from entities that would normally drop nothing, including [[villager]]s, [[bat]]s, [[silverfish]], and the [[ender dragon]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Swampland]]'''
* Removed marsh-like areas (later readded in {{verlink|Java Edition 14w26a}}).<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190710031443/http://i.imgur.com/wE7PK24.png</ref>
