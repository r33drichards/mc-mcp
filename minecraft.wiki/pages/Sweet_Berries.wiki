'''Sweet berries''' are a [[food]] item obtained from sweet berry bushes and are used to plant them.

'''Sweet berry bushes''' are quick-growing [[plant]]s that grow sweet berries. [[Player]]s and most [[mob]]s are slowed down and take constant damage while moving through them. They can be found naturally in [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]] biomes.

== Obtaining ==

=== Natural generation ===
Berry bushes commonly generate in [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]] biomes. Each [[chunk]] has a {{frac|1|12}} chance to generate sweet berry bushes in [[random patch]]es. They also generate in both [[old growth pine taiga]] and [[old growth spruce taiga]] biomes.

{{block distribution}}

=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Fortune#Discrete random}}
Sweet berry bushes can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] with any tool or by hand. A mature sweet berry bush yields 2–3 sweet berries. On its third growth stage, it yields 1–2 sweet berries. Each level of [[Fortune]] can increase the amount of drops by 1.
{{breaking row|Sweet Berries|sprite=sweet-berry-bush|horizontal=1}}

=== Harvesting ===
Sweet berries can be collected from a sweet berry bush by pressing the {{control|use}} control on it, yielding 1–2 sweet berries in its third growth stage, and 2–3 sweet berries in its final growth stage. After dropping the berries on the ground, the sweet berry bush reverts to its second growth stage. 

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|sweet-berries}}

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Placing sweet berries on a [[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]], [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]] creates a small sweet berry bush that eventually becomes a fully grown sweet berry bush.

=== Growth ===
A sweet berry bush grows through four stages after it is planted. Its first growth stage is a small bush without any berries. It becomes a grown plant in its second stage, and produces berries in its third and fourth growth stage. The bush needs to be in light level 9 or greater to grow. The bush can be placed on a 1 block high space, but it cannot grow with a full, non-transparent block immediately above it. {{control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on it increases its growth stage by one, regardless of light level and available space, and at full maturity, ejects the sweet berry item.

=== Food ===

To eat sweet berries, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|2}} [[hunger]] and 0.4{{only|je|short=1}} / 1.2{{only|be|short=1}} hunger [[saturation]].

=== Composting ===
Placing sweet berries into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Sweet berries can be fed to [[fox]]es to [[breed]] them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the [[player]] may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds sweet berries. A baby fox bred by a [[player]] trusts the player and does not flee.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Entity movement ===

A sweet berry bush (at any stage) slows down all [[entities]] (except [[Item (entity)|items]]) passing through it. At stage 1 and higher, it causes damage. [[Fox]]es are immune to both characteristics, however. Sweet berry bushes deal {{hp|1}} [[damage]] every tick (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second), only if the entity is moving in the hitbox of the bush. Entities that move through sweet berry bushes slow down to about 34.05% of their normal speed, similar to how a [[cobweb]] slows down mobs to 25% of normal speed. This makes it impossible to jump a full [[block]] while inside the bush.

A sweet berry bush of any growth stage negates all fall damage of entities inside it.

Mobs at standard block height in a [[minecart]] are not damaged when the minecart is pushed through sweet berries. Players in a sweet berry bush take no damage except from horizontal movement, but are unable to jump out of the bush, similar to a cobweb.

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s do not collect nectar from sweet berry bushes, nor will they take damage from being in contact with a sweet berry bush. Sweet berry bushes can be pollenated by bees, accelerating their growth by one stage.

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|java}}, sweet berry bushes absorb [[fall damage]] like [[water]].<ref>{{bug|MC-149990|||WAI}}</ref>
* Foxes harvest mature sweet berry bushes that have grown into their third or fourth stage. Unlike how carrots eaten by rabbits are destroyed and not dropped as items, sweet berry bushes harvested by foxes drop as items, although the fox may pick up one of the dropped berries. The bush remains intact, allowing for automatic sweet berry farms.
