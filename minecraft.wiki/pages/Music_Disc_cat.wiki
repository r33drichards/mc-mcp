'''"cat"''' refers to both a song composed by [[C418]], and a [[music disc]] that plays the song when inserted in a [[jukebox]]. The music disc is obtained from [[creeper]]s killed by [[skeleton]]s, or from various structures, where it is commonly found in [[monster room]]s and [[woodland mansion]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
When killed by any [[skeleton]], [[stray]], [[bogged]], or [[parched]] (or [[wither skeleton]] if given a [[bow]] using commands), a [[creeper]] drops a random music disc, which has a {{frac|1|12}} chance to be "cat".

Because [[TNT]] ignited by a flaming [[arrow]] attributes all resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow, a skeleton igniting a TNT block due to holding a bow enchanted with [[Flame]], or shooting through [[lava]] or fire, also causes any creepers killed in the explosion to drop a disc.<ref>{{bug|MC-210303|||WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-150884|||WAI}}</ref>

[[File:Cat.ogg]]

"cat" is composed of an inquisitive, playful tune played on warm, bubbly synths, which are later joined by chiptune-like synths and soft synth percussion. The piece is very upbeat and hopeful compared to other tracks, but it has a wistful undertone. At 1:46, what sounds like an interpolation of part of the melody from the track ''[[Minecraft (song)|Minecraft]]'' plays.

The four-note pattern at 2:04 can also be heard at the beginning of "far" and "Dog".

Exclusively on {{el|lce}}, "[[Dog (song)|Dog]]" is appended to the "cat" music disc. Once "cat" is done playing and fades out, "Dog" begins playing for another two minutes or so, making the Legacy Console Edition version of "cat" the longest music disc in the game.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "cat" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "cat", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 2.
