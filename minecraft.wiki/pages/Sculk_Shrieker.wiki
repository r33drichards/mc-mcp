A '''sculk shrieker''' is a [[sculk family|sculk]] block that will "shriek" if any [[player]] touches its top (even [[Projectile|indirectly]]) or activates a nearby [[sculk sensor]]. Only players can trigger it. 

[[Deep Dark|Naturally-generated]] sculk shriekers also inflict [[Darkness]] and may summon a [[warden]] if triggered, but shriekers placed by players or [[sculk catalyst]]s are completely inert and harmless.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A sculk shrieker can be mined with any tool, but [[hoe]]s are the quickest. It drops itself only if mined with any tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. If mined with a non-Silk Touch tool, it drops 5 [[experience]] instead. When a sculk shrieker is broken it loses the ability to summon wardens, even if mined with Silk Touch.
{{Breaking row|Sculk Shrieker|Hoe|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Sculk shriekers can be found infrequently within the [[deep dark]] biome, and they are much more common within [[ancient cities]]. All naturally generated shriekers can summon wardens.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
A [[sculk catalyst]] has a 1% chance of generating a sculk shrieker on top of a [[sculk]] block. These shriekers do not summon wardens.

== Usage ==
[[File:Shriek.png|thumb|The shriek particle.]]
Sculk shriekers "shriek" after being activated. A sculk shrieker activates when any player stands on the black part in the center of the block, even when {{Control|sneaking}}. Sculk shriekers are also activated by any [[sculk sensor]] triggered within an 8-block spherical radius of itself, but only if the [[vibration]] was caused by a player. However, a [[sculk sensor]] cannot activate the sculk shrieker if the line between the two contains a wool block. The shrieker shrieks for 90 game ticks (4.5 seconds). 

=== Spawning wardens ===
[[File:Sculk shriek particles.png|thumb|A set of shriek particles emitted by a sculk shrieker.]]
Sculk shriekers that naturally generate in the deep dark biome are capable of inflicting the [[Darkness]] effect upon players and summoning wardens. If a sculk shrieker is placed by a player or generated via a [[sculk catalyst]], the tag <code>can_summon</code> is set to <code>false</code>, and therefore a warden cannot be summoned and Darkness cannot be inflicted by that sculk shrieker<ref>{{bug|MC-250137|||Works As Intended }}</ref>. Each time a naturally generated sculk shrieker is activated, it adds 1 to a "warning" level to alert a [[warden]]. The warning level is specific to each ''player'', not each sculk shrieker, meaning that the same player can activate a different sculk shrieker for each of the four times, and a warden still spawns on the fourth activation, even though any particular shrieker had been activated once. If a player does not activate any sculk shrieker, the warning level decreases by 1 every 10 minutes (12000 ticks). After the shrieking ends, all players in Survival or Adventure mode within 40 blocks are given the [[Darkness]] effect for 12 seconds. After a warden is summoned, a player's warning level does not reset back to 0, meaning multiple wardens can be summoned.

Naturally generated sculk shriekers have a 10-second cooldown per ''player''. This means that if a player triggers one shrieker, they are completely unable to trigger any other shrieker within 10 seconds. The cooldown period includes the 4.5-second shrieking, which means 5.5 seconds after the previous shrieking ends, the player can activate sculk shriekers again.

When a player's warning level reaches level 4, the sculk shrieker attempts to spawn a warden after its shrieking ends. If the shrieker is broken before it ends shrieking, a warden spawns immediately. Up to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 11×13×11 box centered on the shrieker. If there isn't another warden within 24 blocks, a warden emerges from the ground. The warden always spawns at the highest available block. If all 20 spawning attempts fail, a loud roaring sound is played.

In Peaceful [[difficulty]] or {{in|Java}}, if the [[game rule]] <code>doWardenSpawning</code> is set to <code>false</code>, naturally generated sculk shriekers behave as if they are placed by a player: they do shriek, but there is no shrieking cooldown, the player's warning level does not increase, no Darkness effect is inflicted, and no warden spawns.

If the player that triggered the sculk shrieker is outside the shrieker's range when the shrieking ends, the sculk shrieker does not apply the Darkness effect to any player. The player's warning level still increases by 1.

It is possible to make a warden spawn from a distance, by shooting a [[projectile]] into the direction of known sensors that are near shriekers.

The warnings have unique [[subtitles]] at different levels of warning: 
# ''Warden approaches''
# ''Warden advances''
# ''Warden draws close''

=== Vibration filter ===
[[File:Vibration_JE1_BE1.gif|thumb|The sculk sensor vibration [[particle]].]]
Since sculk shriekers only activate in response to vibrations caused by a player, it has the potential be used for systems that require player-only vibrations. Activated sculk shriekers can also be detected by an [[observer]], making it useful for sending a pulse to [[redstone]] components.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Sculk shriekers cannot be moved by [[piston]]s or [[sticky piston]]s.
