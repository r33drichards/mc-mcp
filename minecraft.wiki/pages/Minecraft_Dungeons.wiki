== Gameplay ==
{{main|MCD:Gameplay|title1=Gameplay}}
The game supports up to four players and features various new weapons, items, and [[MCD:Mob|mobs]], as well as a variety of environments to explore and an overarching quest that sees the player characters, heroes, face off against a main antagonist, called the [[MCD:Arch-Illager|Arch-Illager]]. The game has specific quests and [[MCD:Locations|locations]], along with procedurally generated elements.<ref name = "IGNDungeons">[https://ign.com/articles/2018/09/29/minecraft-dungeons-announced-for-pc Minecraft: Dungeons announced for PC] - IGN, September 29, 2018</ref> The player is not restricted to one class, and can pick up more armor or weapons and use them. Players cannot build or mine because the game is focused on action/adventure. The game takes place both above ground and below. Players can replay levels they have previously beaten. There is a camp "hub" that takes place in part of the tutorial mission, the [[MCD:Squid Coast|Squid Coast]], with shops unlockable by saving merchants. Missions are procedurally generated, and Mojang was considering using [[Seed (world generation)|level generation seeds]].<ref>{{link|url=https://gameinformer.com/preview/2019/05/17/mojang-unearths-a-bit-more-info|title=Minecraft: Dungeons – Mojang unearths a bit more info|website=GameInformer|date=May 17, 2019}}</ref>

Players can choose a character from a variety of heroes provided, with additional heroes available as paid DLC. Character creator skins as well as skins purchased in regular ''[[Minecraft]]'' are not available for use in ''Minecraft Dungeons''.

=== Hero ===
{{Main|MCD:Hero|title1=Hero}}
The [[MCD:Hero|hero]] is the character that the player controls in the game. When starting a game, the player can choose a cosmetic hero that they can use throughout the game. All of the heroes are purely cosmetic and do not offer special exclusive benefits.

When selecting a hero, all loot, levels, and progress gained stays only on that hero and does not carry over into other heroes that the player plays as. If the player started a game with a hero, but changed their mind and wants to play as a different hero with different loot, they can duplicate the hero with the same loot the original hero had.

=== Missions ===
{{Main|MCD:Mission|title1=Mission}}
When the player starts up the game for the first time, the hero that they select begins at the [[MCD:Squid Coast|Squid Coast]]. They then progress throughout the other [[MCD:Mission|missions]], such as the [[MCD:Creeper Woods|Creeper Woods]], until they reach the final mission of the base game, the [[MCD:Obsidian Pinnacle|Obsidian Pinnacle]]. Sometimes a mission can generate an optional [[MCD:Sub Dungeon|sub dungeon]] containing a [[MCD:scroll|scroll]] that, when collected, unlocks a [[MCD:Secret Mission|secret mission]]. Other missions are procedurally unlocked by completing missions normally. All missions within the initial Arch-Illager story take place on the [[MCD:Mainland|mainland]]. Other missions are available only through the DLC packs. The secret mission, [[MCD:???|???]], requires heroes to collect all nine [[MCD:Rune Room|runes]] after defeating the [[MCD:Arch-Illager|Arch-Illager]].

=== Items ===
'''[[MCD:Weapon|Weapons]]''' are tools that can be used to damage entities with either melee or ranged attacks. They can be enchanted to increase their effectiveness.

'''[[MCD:Armor|Armor]]''' is used to protect the hero from damage and provide additional [[MCD:Health Heart|health]]. It can be enchanted to increase its effectiveness as well as provide miscellaneous uses to the hero, like a burning aura through the [[MCD:Burning|burning]] enchantment or a chilling aura that slows mobs through the [[MCD:Chilling|chilling]] enchantment, both of which don't necessarily boost protection, but provide more utility to the hero.

'''[[MCD:Artifact|Artifacts]]''' are objects that the hero can use to gain a significant power-up, damage foes, heal allies, etc. They behave like spells which provide an effect and are on a cooldown timer. The effectiveness of artifacts can be augmented through certain armor [[MCD:Enchantment|enchantments]].

'''[[MCD:Consumable|Consumables]]''' are non-equipable items that randomly drop during gameplay to restore [[MCD:Health Heart|health]], ammo and provide temporary positive [[MCD:Effect|Status effects]] to the hero as well as deal massive splash damage to foes.

'''[[MCD:Cosmetic|Cosmetics]]''' include [[MCD:Cape|capes]], [[MCD:Emote|emotes]], [[MCD:Flair|flairs]], and [[MCD:Pet (cosmetic)|pets]] that provide no functional benefit to the hero and are designed for cosmetics and looks. Capes can either be obtained by players who own the [[MCD:Hero Pass|Hero Pass]], are free or were obtained by completing a set amount of [[MCD:Seasonal Trial|Seasonal Trials]]. Pet cosmetics are either free, require the player to purchase DLC to be equipped, or by completing a set amount of Seasonal Trials.

Heroes can gift [[MCD:Weapon|weapons]], [[MCD:Armor|armor]] and [[MCD:Artifact|artifacts]] to heroes made by other players by interacting with the [[MCD:Gift Wrapper|gift wrapper]].

=== Enchantments ===
{{Main|MCD:Enchantment|title1=Enchantments}}
Weapons and armor collected throughout the game possess randomly selected [[MCD:Enchantment|enchantments]] that, once activated by spending [[MCD:Level And Experience#Enchantment point|enchantment points]] obtained by [[MCD:Level And Experience|leveling up]], augment and alter the properties of the equipment. Equipment can appear with up to three enchantment slots each possessing a maximum of three enchantments to select from of which one can be activated. Enchantments are specific to the equipment type they appear on; [[MCD:Enchantment#Ranged|ranged weapons enchantments]] never appear on armor, for instance.

Enchantments can enhance damage output, increase defense, apply positive or negative Status Effects, restore or increase health and speed, spawn [[MCD:Consumable|consumables]], [[MCD:Emerald|emeralds]], [[MCD:Bee|bees]], escape death, and more.

=== Mobs ===
{{Main|MCD:Mob|title1=Mobs}}
Mobs (short for "mobiles") are creatures encountered throughout the game. Most in ''Minecraft Dungeons'' are [[MCD:Mob#hostile|hostile]] and attempt to destroy the hero on sight, some are [[MCD:Mob#Passive|passive]] and never attack, and few are [[MCD:Mob#Neutral|neutral]] that attack only if the hero attacks it first. Mobs [[MCD:Pet (summonable)|summoned]] by the hero are friendly, cannot be directly damaged by the hero, and attack hostile mobs.

There are four broad types of hostile mobs that the heroes fight in the game: [[MCD:Mob|mobs]], [[MCD:Enchanted|enchanted mobs]], [[MCD:Powerful|powerful mobs]], and [[MCD:Boss|bosses]].

Defeating mobs gives the hero [[MCD:Level and experience|experience]] and they often drop emeralds, consumables, weapons, and armor.

Throughout the game, mobs ambush the hero and a rising gate blocks further progression until all mobs that spawned in the ambush are defeated. The Arch-Illager can be seen initiating most of the ambushes on the [[MCD:Mainland|Mainland]].

== Synopsis ==
''Minecraft Dungeons'' is set in the same universe as ''Minecraft''.<ref name="Website"/> Unlike ''Minecraft'', which is a sandbox, the game features a linear, story-driven campaign, and cinematics. The opening cinematic tells the story of an outcast Illager named Archie, who was rejected by all those who he met. One day, he stumbled upon a powerful artifact known as the "[[MCD:Orb of Dominance|Orb of Dominance]]," which granted him great powers but also began to influence his decision making. The power-hungry "[[Arch-Illager]]" then sought vengeance on all those who wronged him, and soon subjugated the world with his new army, raiding villages, forcing villagers to work as slave labor, and leaving only chaos behind. It's now up to the hero to stand up against the Arch-Illager's tyranny in order to defeat him and save the world.<ref>{{ytl|mJczpIdONjs&|Minecraft Dungeons: Opening Cinematic|Minecraft|September 29, 2019}}</ref>

The hero explores various locations in their quest to stop the Arch-Illager, fighting his army and completing quests in order to pass on to the next mission. Ultimately, they face the Arch-Illager in his castle, defeating him and shattering the Orb of Dominance in the process, which frees Archie from its influence. Afterward, they show kindness to Archie, much to his surprise, and together they celebrate that evil has been defeated and the world saved, though the Orb is later shown to be rebuilding itself and being stolen by an enderman.

[[File:SeasonPassDLC's.png|thumb|All of the season pass DLCs that have come to Minecraft Dungeons.]]

The [[Dungeons:Downloadable Content|DLC]] packs continue the story as follows:

* In [[MCD:Jungle Awakens|Jungle Awakens]], one of the orb fragments creates the [[MCD:Jungle Abomination|jungle abomination]] and various other monsters out of the [[jungle]] flora. The hero manages to destroy the shard and frees the jungle.

* In [[MCD:Creeping Winter|Creeping Winter]], another orb fragment corrupts a {{MCD|wraith}}, covering the island in an eternal winter. The hero must defeat the [[MCD:Wretched Wraith|wretched wraith]], destroy the shard and rid the island of its eternal winter.

* In [[MCD:Howling Peaks|Howling Peaks]], another orb fragment lands on top of a [[mountain]], corrupting the fabled [[MCD:Tempest Golem|tempest golem]]. The hero must leap up the mountain and defeat the corrupted protector of the sanctum.

* In [[MCD:Flames of the Nether|Flames of the Nether]], the hero travels to [[The Nether]]. The Orb of Dominance is not in this DLC, therefore there is not a main boss. The only hint of a narrative in this DLC alludes to the hero's portal breaking, and having to find a new one.

* In [[MCD:Hidden Depths|Hidden Depths]], an orb fragment crashes into the ocean, corrupting an [[MCD:Elder Guardian|elder guardian]]. The hero must dive deep into the depths of the sea and defeat the [[MCD:Ancient Guardian|ancient guardian]].

* In [[MCD:Echoing Void|Echoing Void]], it is discovered that the {{MCD|Heart of Ender}} had survived its assumed destruction atop the [[MCD:Obsidian Pinnacle|Obsidian Pinnacle]]. With the [[MCD:Orb of Dominance|reborn orb's]] existence threatening to cause [[The End]] to bleed into [[MCD:Mainland|The Overworld]], it is up to the hero to travel to the endless void between worlds and put an end to the [[MCD:Vengeful Heart of Ender|Vengeful Heart of Ender]] for good.

== Development ==
The game was announced at [[MINECON Earth 2018]].<ref name = "IGNDungeons"/> It appears as a visually enhanced version of the base ''[[Minecraft]]'' game, but has a different gameplay style.<ref>[https://polygon.com/2018/9/29/17916066/minecraft-dungeons-mojang-minecon Mojang announces Minecraft: Dungeons] - Polygon, September 29, 2018</ref> The game is inspired by classic dungeon crawlers<ref name="Website"/> and, according to [[Marc Watson]], was originally "made up of the remnants of the [[:en:Mojang_Studios#Caller's_Bane|Scrolls]] team".<ref name=":0" /> On September 17, 2019,  [[Double Eleven]] announced that they are assisting Mojang Studios and Xbox Game Studios with development, particularly with multiplayer and the console versions.<ref>{{link|url=https://double11.com/2019/09/17/announcement-minecraft-dungeons|website=Double11.com|title=Announcement: Minecraft Dungeons|date=September 17, 2019}}</ref>
