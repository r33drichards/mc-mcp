'''Screenshots''' are images of the player camera view taken while playing the game.

Screenshots can be taken when the player is in the first person or [[third person]] camera view.

== ''Java Edition'' ==
[[File:Screenshot JE.png|thumb|right|After taking a screenshot, a message appears in the [[chat]] of its filename, where you can click it to open the image file on the computer.]]
{{IN|java}}, screenshots can be taken in-game by pressing the default {{key|F2}} key,<ref name="screenshot-guide">{{mcnet|screenshotting-guide|Screenshotting Guide|February 7, 2019|Tom Stone}}</ref> or the {{keys|Fn+F2}} for macOS, some laptops and other keyboards. Screenshots are automatically saved in the "screenshots" directory within the [[.minecraft]] directory.

Like other control keys in ''Java Edition'', the screenshot key can be customized by navigating through {{UI|[[Options]]...|[[Controls]]...|Key Binds...}}, and select the key binding of "Take a screenshot" under the "Miscellaneous" category.

=== Storage ===

Screenshots are saved as {{w|PNG}} files in the {{cd|[[.minecraft]]/screenshots}} directory, with the filename format based on the current date and time: {{nowrap|<code>''YYYY''-''MM''-''DD''_''HH''.''MM''.''SS''.png</code>}}. For example, a screenshot taken on {{#time: F j, Y, "at" g:i:s A}} gets named <code>{{nowrap|{{#time: Y-m-d_h.i.s".png"}}}}</code>. If multiple screenshots are saved within the same second, a revision number is appended to the file name (e.g., <code>{{#time: Y-m-d_h.i.s"_1.png"}}</code> is the second screenshot taken at that time).

On Windows, the screenshot directory can be accessed by pressing {{keys|Win+R}} and typing {{cd|%AppData%\.minecraft\screenshots}}. On Mac, screenshots are stored in {{cd|~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/screenshots}}, and on Linux, they are stored in {{cd|~/.minecraft/screenshots}}.

The screenshots directory can also be accessed by going to "Resource Packs" in the settings menu, clicking on "Open resource pack folder", and going up one level.

=== Screenshot options ===

It is possible to change what features are included in the screenshot by pressing [[Controls#Non-configurable controls|control keys]]. By default, the screenshots look exactly like the screen during regular gameplay.

[[File:Ore UI - Screenshot Gallery Screen - Screenshot Details Button Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumbnail|The "Screenshot Details" screen.]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, screenshots can be taken in-game by pressing the screenshot button ([[File:BedrockScreenshot.png|24px]]) in the [[pause menu]]. Like {{el|java}}, screenshots can also be taken by pressing the default {{key|F2}} key for computers, or the {{keys|Fn+F2}} keys for some laptops and other keyboards; however, it can only be taken in [[gameplay]] (while playing in a world), not while in a [[menu screen]]. Screenshots always hide the [[HUD]], but name tags from other entities are still shown.

The screenshot button is not available on the pause menu for players who are not signed in to Microsoft account.

=== Usage ===
[[File:Ore UI - Manage Showcase Gallery Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumbnail|right|A customizable showcase gallery which are shown to the player's friends.]]
Once a screenshot is taken, they can be managed on the "Screenshot Gallery" under the "[[Profile screen]]", which showcase all of the screenshots the player has taken in the game.

In the gallery, players can use their saved screenshots to customize certain elements of the game, such as setting their saved world's thumbnail, regardless if the screenshot was not originally from that world. They can also use it to set their profile's featured banner and showcase gallery, which are shown to their friends in the profile screen.

In ''Realms'', players can share their screenshots to [[Realms Stories]].<ref name="screenshot-guide">{{mcnet|screenshotting-guide|Screenshotting Guide|February 7, 2019|Tom Stone}}</ref>

=== Storage ===

Screenshots are saved in the <code>[[com.mojang]]/Screenshots/''XUID''</code> directory, the ''XUID'' being the ID of the player's Xbox account. Each screenshot consists of 2-3 files:

* <code>''UUID''.jpeg</code>: The image itself, in JPEG format.
* <code>''UUID''.json</code>: The screenshot metadata, in JSON format.
* <code>''UUID''.mc</code>: 32 byte long file of unknown format and purpose. The game does not appear to be using these files. They are only known to be created on the Android platform, and known not to be created on the Windows platform.

The ''UUID'' is a string encoded, version 4, RFC 4122 variant [[UUID]] generated for each screenshot.

The metadata JSON file has the following structure:

<div class="treeview">
* {{Nbt|compound}}: The root object
** {{Nbt|double|captureTime}}: Time the screenshot was taken at, as seconds since the UNIX epoch
</div>

If there are any <code>''YYYY''-''MM''-''DD''_''HH''.''mm''.''ss''[''sequence''].jpeg</code> files, possibly with corresponding <code>''YYYY''-''MM''-''DD''_''HH''.''mm''.''ss''[''sequence''].mc</code> files, which was the old naming format used in previous versions, the game renames them to the new format, and creates the metadata file based on the timestamp included as part of the old name, assuming the current system timezone.

=== Using Xbox alternatives ===
On Windows, players can screenshot their game by pressing the {{keys|Win+G}}, opening Xbox Game Bar overlay, and clicking the camera button to take a screenshot under the ''Capture'' window.<ref name="screenshot-guide"/> A notification then appears, and when clicked, it opens up the ''Gallery'' window, where you can see the screenshot and the location it was saved. The default screenshot directory is {{cd|C:\Users\''username''\Videos\Captures}}. Players can also take screenshots quickly by pressing the {{keys|Win+Alt+PrtScn}} keys.

On an Xbox console, press the ''Xbox'' button, and press the {{xbtn|Y}} button to take a screenshot, or the {{xbtn|X}} button to take a video clip. You can upload your screenshot through the Captures app, and download it by visiting your profile page on the [https://xbox.com/ Xbox website] under the ''Captures'' tab, or through the Xbox mobile app.

== ''Minecraft Education'' ==

{{IN|education}}, players can take screenshots as a gameplay feature by using the [[camera]] item.<ref name="screenshot-edu">{{link|title=Assessment Tools (Cameras, Portfolio, Book & Quill)|author=Penny|website=Minecraft Education Support|url=https://aka.ms/MEEBookAndQuill}}</ref> When the camera is selected in the player [[hotbar]], players can take a first person view screenshot by right-clicking it. 

Camera can also be placed, creating a camera entity that tracks the user, and take pictures from the camera's perspective. Photos that are taken with the camera appear in the [[portfolio]].

Close-up snapshots of an item on the ground can be taken by holding the {{key|shift}} key while right-clicking.

Screenshots are shown as photos in chronological order on the portfolio. Players can type a short caption text under the picture of the photo. These photos then can be exported in {{w|JPEG}} inside a {{w|ZIP file}} in the specified directory by clicking the "Export Portfolio" button.<ref name="screenshot-edu"/>

Screenshots can also be inserted into [[book and quill]], and then exported as a {{w|PDF}}, along with the written text, title and author shown in the filename.<ref name="screenshot-edu"/>

Screenshots taken with the camera are stored in {{cd|[[com.mojang]]/Screenshots}}.
