'''24w10a''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], released on March 6, 2024,<ref>{{snap|24w10a|March 6, 2024}}</ref> which adds eight new wolf variants found in different biomes, simplified forms for [[item stack component]]s, updated [[inventory]] slot names, allows item components in [[recipe]]s, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Added variants of wolves.
** [[File:EntitySprite wolf.png|16px]] The familiar pale wolf now spawns in [[taiga]]s.
** [[File:EntitySprite rusty-wolf.png|16px]] The rusty wolf spawns in [[sparse jungle]]s.
** [[File:EntitySprite spotted-wolf.png|16px]] The spotted wolf spawns in [[savanna plateau]]s.
** [[File:EntitySprite black-wolf.png|16px]] The black wolf spawns in [[old growth pine taiga]].
** [[File:EntitySprite striped-wolf.png|16px]] The striped wolf spawns in [[wooded badlands]].
** [[File:EntitySprite snowy-wolf.png|16px]] The snowy wolf spawns in [[grove]]s.
** [[File:EntitySprite ashen-wolf.png|16px]] The ashen wolf spawns in [[snowy taiga]]s.
** [[File:EntitySprite woods-wolf.png|16px]] The woods wolf spawns in [[forest]]s.
** [[File:EntitySprite chestnut-wolf.png|16px]] The chestnut wolf spawns in [[old growth spruce taiga]].<ref>{{Mcnet|new-minecraft-wolves|New Minecraft Wolves|March 5, 2024|Sophie Austin}}</ref>
** Wolves spawned with a [[spawn egg]] spawn as the variant associated with the biome the egg is used in. They default to pale wolf in any other biome.

=== General ===
'''Entity [[predicate]]'''
* Added entity sub-predicate <code>slots</code>, used to check single or multiple slots on any entity.
** For slot ranges, only one slot needs to match for whole entry to pass.
** The field contains a map of slot names (same as ones used in <code>item</code> commands) to item predicate.
** Example:
:: <syntaxhighlight lang="json">{
    "condition": "minecraft:entity_properties",
    "entity": "this",
    "predicate": {
        "slots": {
            "container.*": {
                "items": "dirt"
            }
        }
    }
}</syntaxhighlight>

'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Added new slot names:
** <code>container.*</code>: contains <code>container.0</code> to <code>container.53</code>.
** <code>hotbar.*</code>: contains <code>hotbar.0</code> to <code>hotbar.8</code>.
** <code>inventory.*</code>: contains <code>inventory.0</code> to <code>inventory.26</code>.
** <code>enderchest.*</code>: contains <code>enderchest.0</code> to <code>enderchest.26</code>.
** <code>villager.*</code>: contains <code>villager.0</code> to <code>villager.7</code>.
** <code>horse.*</code>: contains <code>horse.0</code> to <code>horse.14</code>.
** <code>weapon.*</code>: contains <code>weapon.mainhand</code> and <code>weapon.offhand</code>.
** <code>armor.*</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|armor.head|armor.chest|armor.legs|armor.feed|armor.body}}.
** <code>player.cursor</code>: item held by player on screen except [[Creative]] mode<ref>{{bug|MC-269127||player.cursor slot name is available in creative mode|WAI}}</ref>.
** {{cd|d=and|player.crafting.0|player.crafting.1|player.crafting.2|player.crafting.3|player.crafting.*}}: player's crafting slots.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Grindstone]]'''
* No longer accepts items with {{nbt|compound|unbreakable}} component that do not have an enchantment.
** If the item above has [[durability]], it can be repaired with an unbreakable item and the output doesn't inherit {{nbt|compound|unbreakable}} component. If the order is swapped, the item is neither repaired nor disenchanted. If the only item in the slots is an enchanted unbreakable item, it is disenchanted and {{nbt|compound|unbreakable}} component remains.
* No longer disenchants two [[enchanted book]]s at the same time.

'''[[Player head]]'''
* Now stores item name in <code>custom_name</code> tag.
* Tags <code>SkullOwner</code> and <code>ExtraType</code> are replaced with <code>profile</code> to keep a consistent format with the item component form.

=== Items ===
'''General'''
* Now <code>count</code> is stored again when there is only 1 item.
** Defaults to 1 if this field is invalid.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Now spawns on [[coarse dirt]] and [[podzol]] blocks.
* Now spawns in [[sparse jungle]], [[savanna plateau]], and [[wooded badlands]] biomes.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Grove]]'''
* [[Rabbit]]s, [[wolves]], and [[fox]]es are now the only passive mobs spawning in the grove biome.

=== Command formats ===
'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* <code>if</code> and <code>unless</code> sub-commands can now use <code>items</code> to compare or count items.
** <code><nowiki>execute if|unless items <source> <slots> <item_predicate></nowiki></code>
*** <code><nowiki><source></nowiki></code> is the same one as used in {{cmd|item}}.
**** e.g. <code>block <x> <y> <z></code> or <code>entity <target></code> (selector can return multiple entities)
*** <code><slots></code> can accept single slot (like <code>container.0</code>) or a range (like <code>container.*</code>)
*** <code><item_predicate></code> is the same as item predicate in {{cmd|clear}} command.
* If used alone, it returns total number of items in stacks that match predicates.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* The data pack version is now 34.
* [[Banner pattern]]s are now be loaded into the registry from <code>data/<''namespace''>/banner_pattern/<''id''></code>
<div class="treeview">
:* {{nbt|compound}}: The root object.
:** {{nbt|string|asset_id}}: A namespaced id for the texture. e.g. <code>custom:pattern</code> resolves to <code>assets/custom/textures/entity/banner/pattern.png</code> and <code>assets/custom/textures/entity/shield/pattern.png</code>.
:** {{nbt|string|translation_key}}: A translation key prefix. e.g. <code>block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern</code> resolves to <code>block.minecraft.banner.custom.pattern.<''color''></code>.
</div>

'''[[Item stack component]]s'''
* {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound|profile}} no longer requires {{nbt|string|name}} field.
* Some additional item stack components now support alternative, simple definitions:
** {{nbt|compound|profile}} can now be defined as {{nbt|string|profile}} for a player name. e.g. <code>profile="jeb_"</code>.
** {{nbt|compound|dyed_color}} can now be defined as {{nbt|int|dyed_color}}. e.g. <code>dyed_color=16711680</code>.
** {{nbt|compound|attribute_modifiers}} can now be defined as {{nbt|list|attribute_modifiers}}. e.g. <code>attribute_modifiers=[{type:'generic.scale',uuid:[1,2,3,4],name:'Big!',amount:1.0,operation:'add_multiplied_base'}]</code>.
** {{nbt|compound|potion_contents}} can now be defined as a single potion id {{nbt|string|potion_contents}}. e.g. <code>potion_contents="invisibility"</code>.
** {{nbt|compound|enchantments}} and {{nbt|compound|stored_enchantments}} can be defined as an inline map of [[enchantment]] id to level: <code>enchantments={sharpness:1}</code>.
** When stored, they still are in full formats.
* {{nbt|compound|container}} now applies to all [[container]]s instead of only [[shulker box]]es.
* {{nbt|compound|lodestone_target}} is renamed to {{nbt|compound|lodestone_tracker}}.
** {{nbt|int-array|pos}} and {{nbt|string|dimension}} are now moved to {{nbt|compound|target}} (optional).
** When {{nbt|compound|target}} does not exist, the compass spins.
* {{nbt|list|lore}} and {{nbt|list|fireworks/explosions}} now allows 256 entities.
* Items with {{nbt|compound|can_break}} and {{nbt|compound|can_place_on}} can now be stacked properly.

'''[[Recipe]]'''
* Can now specify item component.
** {{nbt|compound|result}} field for {{cd|d=and|crafting_shaped|crafting_shapeless|stonecutting|smithing_transform}} now accepts {{nbt|compound|components}}.
** {{nbt|string|result}} field for {{cd|d=and|smelting|blasting|smoking|campfire_cooking}} recipes are now an item stack without count. That is, {{nbt|string|id}} must be specified and {{nbt|compound|components}} is now accepted.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>coarse_dirt</code> and <code>podzol</code> to <code>#wolves_spawnable_on</code>.

'''[[Tooltip]]'''
* No longer appears when hovering outside the containing element.

== Experimental ==
=== Changes ===
'''[[Vault]]'''
* The left pixels in the disabled vault have been updated to match the other vault textures.
