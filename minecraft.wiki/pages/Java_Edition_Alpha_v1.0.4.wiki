'''Alpha v1.0.4''', also known as '''Seecret Friday 4''', is the fourth [[seecret update]] and the second of [[Java Edition Alpha]], released on July 9, 2010,<ref>[[wordofnotch:789757070|"Seecret Friday 4! OooooOOOoo!"]] – [[The Word of Notch]], July 9, 2010</ref> which added [[winter mode]], [[snowfall]], and two new [[block]]s. This is the oldest Alpha version to be available in the [[launcher]].

=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Ice JE3 BE5.png|32px]] [[Ice]]'''
* Slippery when stepped on.
* Generates when water is exposed to the sky on world generation.
* It can be melted by [[fire]] or [[lava]].

'''[[File:Snow (layers 1) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Snow]]'''
* Spawns on top of most blocks when exposed to snowfall.
* Cannot be obtained yet.
* It can be melted by [[fire]] or [[lava]].

=== World generation ===
'''[[Winter mode]]'''
* Added a new "Winter mode" map type, featuring:

*** However, water found on gravel beaches is not entirely frozen upon generation.
** Upon world creation there is a 25% chance for it to become a winter world.<ref>A winter world is defined by the boolean [[NBT]] <code>SnowCovered=1</code> in [[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]].</ref>
