The fourth version of '''0.25 SURVIVAL TEST'''<ref name="didn't bump">[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:58:33 <08Notch> i didn't bump the number :-O''" [...] "''A11:58:56 <Quatroking> Notch: but we do have a new version?''" [...] "''A11:59:11 <08Notch> yes, Quatroking ''" (16:58 to 16:59 UTC)</ref><ref>{{ytl|6NHN214GruY|Minecraft survival update, attacked by skeletons|citricsquid|September 3, 2009, 17:21:06 UTC}} | As cited in [[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:02:24 <citricsquid> got a video :D''" (17:02:24 UTC)</ref> is a version of [[Survival Test]] released on September 3, 2009, at 16:58 UTC.<ref name="release">[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:57:05 <08Notch> level loading will work any second now''", "''A11:57:08 <08Notch> just uploaded a new index.jsp''" [...] "''A11:58:06 <08Notch> loading via url works now, yay''", "''A11:58:10 <08Notch> and arrows stay around much longer''" (16:58 UTC)</ref>

== Trivia ==
* Each subsequent patch version of [[0.25 SURVIVAL TEST]] did not change the version number,<ref name="didn't bump" /> leading to one user mistakenly changing the wiki version<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:59:24 <Quatroking> then how should I put it on the wiki''" [...] "''A11:59:32 <Quatroking> Survival_test_4?''" [...] "''P12:00:34 <Quatroking> I'm changing it to 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST_4, okay?''" (16:59–17:00 UTC)</ref> from "0.25_SURVIVAL_TEST_3" to "0.25_SURVIVAL_TEST_4",<ref>[[Special:Diff/2558|Wiki diff #2558]] – September 3, 2009, 17:00 UTC</ref> a version that does not exist,<ref group=note>"0.24" was used as the multiple reuploads of 0.25 SURVIVAL TEST were released all on the same day and the user did not realize that these had a new version number.</ref> upon the release of this version. Notch saw this and thought that this user was telling him that the unlabelled patches for 0.25 should have labels and that the current version should be "_04", so Notch made the next version "[[0.25_05 SURVIVAL TEST]]",<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:11:04 <08Notch> 0.25_05 is up with a bug fix (monsters chasing dead monsters), and a small bonus. :D''" (17:11 UTC)</ref> even though under Notch's [[version format]] used at the time the version after this one would technically be "_04".
