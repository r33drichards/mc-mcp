'''18w14a''' is the twenty-ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on April 4, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w14a|April 4, 2018}}</ref>, which added [[phantom membrane]] and the [[Slow Falling]] effect.

== Additions ==

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Phantom Membrane JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Phantom membrane]]s'''
* Dropped by [[phantom]]s.
* Used to repair [[elytra]].
* Can be used to brew potions of Slow Falling.

'''[[File:Potion of Slow Falling JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Potion of Slow Falling]]'''
* Brewed with phantom membrane.
* Gives the player the [[Slow Falling]] status effect for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
* Can be extended to 4 minutes by brewing with redstone.
* Brewing it with [[gunpowder]] or [[dragon's breath]] creates a [[splash potion|splash]] or [[lingering potion]], respectively.

'''[[File:Arrow of Slow Falling JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Arrow of Slow Falling]]'''
* Effects the shot mob with the Slow Falling status effect.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Effect]]s'''
* [[File:Slow Falling JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Slow Falling]]
** It causes the player to descend at a much slower rate, and not take any damage when hitting the ground.
*** This allows the player to jump further than normal.
**** If the player is sprinting while under the Slow Falling effect, they are able to jump across a gap of over 5.5 blocks, compared to 4 with normal sprinting.
** Crops don't get destroyed if the player lands on them with the Slow Falling effect.
** Higher levels do not change the rate of descent.

'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added 4 new advancements:
** Fishy Business: 'Catch a fish'
** Tactical fishing: 'Catch a fish... without a fishing rod!'
** A Throwaway Joke: 'Throw a trident at something'
** Very Very Frightening: 'Strike a Villager with lightning'
* Added three new advancement triggers:
** <code>minecraft:fishing_rod_hooked</code> triggers when a player reels in an item or entity;
** <code>minecraft:channeled_lightning</code> triggers when a player uses the Channeling enchantment to strike a mob;
** <code>minecraft:filled_bucket</code> triggers when a player fills a bucket.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* {{key|F3+C}}
** Now gives a warning before forcing a debug crash.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Kelp]]'''
* Changed texture.

=== Items ===
'''[[Elytra]]'''
* Now requires phantom membrane to be repaired instead of leather.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Phantom]]s'''
* Now drop phantom membrane instead of leather.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Kelp]]'''
* Cannot generate anymore in warm oceans.

'''[[Seagrass]]'''
* Can now generate in rivers and swamps.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* [[Riptide]]
** No longer compatible with [[Loyalty]] or [[Channeling]].
** If the player is not in water and it is not raining, the player is no longer able to throw [[trident]]s enchanted with Riptide, but they still deal melee damage.
** Riptide doesn't throw the trident but instead launches the player forwards.
** Players now display a spinning animation when dashing.

=== General ===
'''Optimizations'''
* Optimized cloud rendering.
