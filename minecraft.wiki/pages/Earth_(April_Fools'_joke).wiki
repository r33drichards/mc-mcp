The '''Earth''' is a celestial body that appears in the joke update [[Java Edition 23w13a or b]], released on April Fool's Day 2023. The Earth replaces the moon in the sky when in [[the Moon]] dimension. The Earth is designed to represent the Overworld being viewed from the Moon.

== The Moon daylight cycle ==
{{main|Daylight cycle}}

The daylight cycle on the Moon (dimension) behaves the same as the Overworld's cycle, but appears differently. Moon is replaced by the Earth, so equivalent of [[night]] is when player can see the Earth. The sky also never changes colors. Night still begins after the [[sun]] has fully set in the west and the Earth has risen in the east. As time passes, the Earth moves westward across the sky. Overall, nighttime lasts about 7 minutes (in real-time). Surprisingly the [[player]]s can still track the Earth's position in the sky using a [[clock]].

During the whole cycle, light on the Moon stays at level 0.

[[Grass block]]s and [[sapling]]s do not grow in earthlight, nor do they decay. To grow them at night requires the use of light sources such as [[torch]]es.

Nighttime cannot be skipped at all using a [[bed]], as beds explode on the Moon.

=== Stars ===
Together with the Earth, the night sky still consists of stars, while it is pitch black during day. Stars appear as bright points, and the starfield rotates with the Earth, rising in the east and descending in the west, as the night progresses.

== Phases ==
The Earth is always opposite of the Sun, like moon. Unlike moon, the Earth has no phases whatsoever.

=== Effects on mobs ===
{{see also|Difficulty#Moon phase|Difficulty#Regional difficulty}}
The only mob on the Moon is the [[moon cow]], and the Earth has no phases. No effects of the Earth on moon cows were observed.

== Appearance ==
The Earth can be seen in four different shapes: [[File:Square Earth.png|32px]] square, [[File:3D Square Earth.png|32px]] cube, [[File:Round Earth.png|32px]] round, [[File:Tea Pot Earth.png|32px]] teapot. The shape can be changed with vote <code>minecraft:world_shape</code>.

== Issues ==
{{April Fools issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The star pattern is based on a seed, but not the current world's seed. Like the ''Bedrock Edition'' pattern, the stars are ''always'' based on the same seed, regardless of the [[world seed]].
