=== World generation ===
==== [[Biome|Biomes]] ====
'''General'''
* Tweaked biome placement in general to reduce the risk of harsh collisions.
* Now biome placement is a bit smoother and less noisy. This should result in fewer microbiomes.
* Removed surface freezing for hot biomes, and raised the altitude at which snow layers are placed.

'''{{BiomeLink|Badlands|Badlands}}'''
* Now is larger and less likely to show up as microbiome splotches.
* [[Terracotta]] bands now go higher.

'''{{BiomeLink|Wooded Badlands|Wooded Badlands}}'''
* Their grass and trees now start higher.

'''{{BiomeLink|Desert|Desert}}'''
* Now is larger and less likely to show up as microbiome splotches.
* Desert pyramids now tend to be partially buried and no longer generate on water.

'''{{BiomeLink|Windswept Hills|Extreme Hills}}'''
* The terrain is now more extreme. Fiddled with the placement of shattered terrain and extreme hills in general to make it fit in with the terrain better.

'''{{EnvLink|Jungle Pyramid|Jungle Pyramid}}'''
* No longer generates on [[water]].

'''Ore distribution'''
* Reduced the number of diorite/andesite/granite blobs on the surface.
* [[Copper ore]] blobs now are bigger in dripstone caves.
* More iron is generated.

'''{{BiomeLink|River|River}}'''
* Reduced the likelihood of rivers being cut off and turning into steep dry river gorges in mountainous terrain. 
* Rivers tend to either carve a fjord through the mountain range, or raise the terrain to form a saddle valley between the peaks. 

'''{{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes|Snowy Slopes}}'''
* Now have fewer dirt blocks.

'''{{BiomeLink|Stony Shore|Stone Shore}}'''
* Sometimes generate layers (strips) of [[gravel]], [[diorite]], [[andesite]], or [[granite]]. 

'''{{BiomeLink|Stony Peaks|Stony Peaks}}'''
* Sometimes generate layers (strips) of [[calcite]], [[andesite]], [[granite]], or [[gravel]].

'''{{BiomeLink|Swamp|Swamp}}'''
* Tweaked swamp placement a bit. 
* Are less likely to extend far out from the coastline.
* Rivers in swamps now tend to be shallower.</onlyinclude>
