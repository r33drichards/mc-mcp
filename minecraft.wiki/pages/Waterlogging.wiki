[[File:Waterlogged Oak Fence.png|thumb|x150px|right|A waterlogged [[oak fence]].]]
'''Waterlogging''' is the mechanic that allows non-cube [[block]]s (that is, blocks that do not completely fill their block volume, such as [[ladder]]s, [[fence]]s, and [[plant]]s) to be filled with a water source block. Both the non-cube block and the water source block occupy the same space. If the non-cube block is destroyed, the water source block remains.

{{IN|be}}, generally all non-cube blocks can be waterlogged and none can be used to displace water source blocks, although they can still displace [[flowing water]].

== Mechanism ==
{{IN|java}}, certain blocks have a {{cd|waterlogged}} block state that can be {{cd|true|d=or|false}}.

{{IN|java}}, if a waterlogged block is pushed by a [[piston]], the waterlogged state of the block is typically removed. However, if the piston is [[Sticky Piston|sticky]], and it is powered by a short pulse so that the sticky piston [[Sticky Piston#Block dropping|spits out the block]], the block retains its waterlogged state. This feature can be used in part of a "flying machine" as a movable water source, since [[dispenser]]s cannot be pushed by pistons {{in|java}}. Waterlogged blocks pulled by a sticky piston always lose their waterlogged state.

{{IN|bedrock}}, waterlogging is handled by the game's layers system. Through editing, any block can be waterlogged, as well as other features such as placing multiple slabs into a single block. In normal gameplay, a player cannot displace water source blocks using doors or other non-cube blocks to create breathing spaces underwater, like one can do {{in|java}}. Only flowing water can be displaced {{in|bedrock}}.

Like water source blocks, all waterlogged blocks are non-flammable and explosion-proof, even if said waterlogged block is flammable. Waterlogged blocks can also interact with [[lava]] to produce [[cobblestone]] or [[obsidian]], although lava cannot convert waterlogged blocks to [[stone]]. Unlike water sources, waterlogged blocks are immune to freezing.

Water can flow from a non-full face, so waterlogged [[stairs]] and [[trapdoor]]s have no water flowing from their solid face. Despite this, interactions between it and [[lava]] are still possible.

== Behavior ==
{{hatnote|This section may be incomplete.}}
The table below shows the water content of different blocks in different versions. legend：
* <span class="tc-no">red</span>  The background indicates that this block cannot be placed in water, and that placed in water marked "dropped" will be broken and become [[drops]].
* <span class="tc-partial">yellow</span>The background indicates that the block must be placed in water.
* <span class="tc-yes">green</span>The background indicates that the block can be placed in flowing water or a water source.
* <span class="tc-planned">blue</span>The background indicates that this block can be placed in a water source.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==  
* {{IN|java}}, glass bottles can be filled up with water from waterlogged blocks, even if water is not accessible from the targeted area.<ref>{{bug|MC-171629|||Won't Fix}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, this is not possible because waterlogged blocks in general cannot be used to fill empty bottles.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-83420}}</ref>
* Waterlogging was the hardest feature to implement on [[Legacy Console Edition]] for [[4J Studios]].<ref>https://discord.com/channels/1212769882001776650/1220687775150637076/1230962628856250390</ref>
