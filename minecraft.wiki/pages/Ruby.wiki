'''Rubies''' were a mineral planned to be added in [[Java Edition 1.3.1]] as a currency for trading with [[villager]]s, but were scrapped and replaced with [[emerald]]s.

== Obtaining ==
Rubies were obtained from mining ruby ore and from trading with villagers, in the same way as the emeralds that replaced them.

== Usage ==
Rubies were used for purchasing items from villagers, and would presumably have been craftable into blocks of ruby.

== History ==
Rubies were intended to be the original currency used for [[trading]]. They could be seen in a screenshot released by Jeb on 21 May 2012,<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|204619936616808451|... and this is why I'm playing with Testificates: i.imgur.com/Z113y.png (work in progress, as usual)|May 21, 2012}}</ref> in which the trading system was first being tested. While it was later decided that [[emerald]]s would take their place as a currency, a ruby texture was still in [[Java Edition 12w21a]]'s <samp>items.png</samp> file alongside the emerald. The unused ruby texture, which was present in the game, differed from the version shown in the screenshot.

Alongside emeralds, 12w21a also implemented [[emerald ore]] as a method of obtaining them. However, the texture used for emerald ore was accidentally set to a texture seemingly intended for ruby ore,<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|205641953742819328|Ok this will be this snapshot's most common question/report: The ore is supposed to be green, not red. Apparently I didn't commit the file|May 24, 2012}}</ref> and translation strings in the game's language files included references to rubies and ruby ore:
* <code>item.ruby.name=Ruby</code>
* <code>tile.oreRuby.name=Ruby Ore</code>

[[Java Edition 12w21b]] was swiftly released to give emerald ore its intended release texture, and the translation strings were removed in the full release of [[Java Edition 1.10]].

Emeralds were decided upon over rubies as [[Dinnerbone]] stated he had difficulty distinguishing between ruby ore and [[redstone ore]] from a far distance, which he attributed to his red-green colorblindness.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217030931/http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1621716-15-new-blocksitems/#entry19977082|title=We actually didn't go with rubies and changed to emeralds at last minute for the villager trading because I'm colour blind and couldn't easily spot the difference between the ruby ore and redstone ore until I was up close.|author=Dinnerbone|website=[[Minecraft Forum]]|date=December 29, 2012}}</ref>

The unused texture remained in the game files until it was ultimately removed in [[Java Edition 21w13a]].<ref name="UnusedFiles">{{bug|MC-108636}}</ref>

The texture was added to ''Pocket Edition'' in [[Pocket Edition v0.8.0 alpha build 2]]. It was eventually removed in [[Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1|the first v0.14.0 build]], but later re-added and is still present in the vanilla resource pack. The texture was also added to the ''Xbox 360 Edition'' in [[Xbox 360 Edition TU9|TU9]], and remained in the console editions until [[Xbox 360 Edition TU54|TU54]] and equivalent versions, in which it was replaced by one of the textures used for [[bed]] items.

[[MCE:Ruby|The name "Ruby" was reused for a currency]] in the now-discontinued game ''[[Minecraft Earth]]'', using completely different textures from those present in the main game.

Rubies were reimplemented as a joke feature in [[23w13a_or_b]] snapshot, where they could replace the [[emerald]] item model via a specific vote.
