'''Structures''' (also known as a "'''generated structure'''" or "'''structure feature'''") are naturally-generated formations that can be located using {{cmd|locate structure}} and will not spawn in the world when the "Generate Structures" option is disabled during [[world creation]]{{Only|java|short=JE}}. Certain [[feature]]s, such as [[monster room]]s or [[desert well]]s, still generate when this option is disabled and are listed under {{Slink|2=Structure-like features}} due to their resemblance to other defined structures.

== Overworld ==
{{main|Overworld}}
The Overworld contains numerous structures, at a wide variety of scales.

=== Underground structures ===
These structures can generate only underground in any [[world type|default]] Overworld.

! Structure
! [[Biome|Biome(s)]]
! Description
|-
| {{EnvLink|Ancient City}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Deep Dark}}
| Long corridors made of [[deepslate]] and [[wool]], connecting to a central building with a frame like structure made of [[reinforced deepslate]]. The central structure resembles a [[warden]]. Small ruins can be found scattered around the ancient city containing loot [[chest]]s inside. Since this structure generates in the deep dark biome, it contains many sculk sensors, shriekers, and catalysts.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Buried Treasure}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Beach}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Beach}}
* {{BiomeLink|Stony Shore}}{{only|be|short=1}}
* {{BiomeLink|Mushroom Field Shore}}{{only|be|short=1}}(unused)
| A hidden [[chest]] containing valuable [[Chest loot|loot]] that spawn in [[Beach|beach/shore biomes]]. They are found using [[treasure map]]s located in [[shipwreck]]s and occasionally [[ocean ruins]].
|-
| {{EnvLink|Mineshaft}}
| Any Overworld biome except {{BiomeLink|Deep Dark}}
| A maze of corridors supported by wooden beams, with incomplete rail systems on which [[minecarts with chest]]s can generate. [[Cave spider spawner]]s may generate here heavily surrounded by [[cobweb]]s. In [[badlands]] biomes, they use [[dark oak planks]] instead of [[oak planks]], and may generate close to the surface.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Stronghold}}
| Any Overworld biome
| Maze-like [[stone bricks]] structures containing many rooms, including one with a usually unactivated [[End portal]]. {{IN|java}}, they have a specific, fixed way of generating, and a maximum of 128 can generate in a single world.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Trail Ruins}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Jungle}}
* {{BiomeLink|Old Growth Birch Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|Old Growth Pine Taiga}}
* {{BiomeLink|Old Growth Spruce Taiga}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga}}
* {{BiomeLink|Taiga}}
| A group of ruined buildings meant to resemble small, ancient settlements. The entire structure is buried underground except for the tip of the tower, which is exposed to the surface. The structure can contain [[suspicious gravel]].
|-
| {{EnvLink|Trial Chambers}} 
| Any Overworld biome except {{BiomeLink|Deep Dark}}
| A large underground structure made of [[copper]] and [[tuff]]-related blocks, featuring [[trial spawner]]s and [[vault]]s. It is the only place where the [[breeze]] is found. This is also the only area besides [[Swamp|swamps]] in which [[bogged]] can spawn.
|}

=== Above ground structures ===
These structures generate only aboveground.

{| class="wikitable"
! Structure
! [[Biome|Biome(s)]]
! Description
|-
| {{EnvLink|Desert Pyramid}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Desert}}
* {{BiomeLink|Desert Hills}}{{only|be|short=1}}(unused)
| Large [[sandstone]] buildings containing four [[chest]]s with loot in an underground room hidden beneath [[terracotta]]. The chests are trapped with [[TNT]] that detonates when a stone [[pressure plate]] in the center is stepped on, destroying the chests and their [[Chest loot|contents]]. Also contains suspicious sand in a buried side room. Sometimes called Desert Temple.
|-
|{{EnvLink|Igloo}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes}}
| [[Snow]] buildings that may have a basement hidden under a [[carpet|grey carpet]]. The igloo itself contains little of value, but the basement has a [[villager]] and a [[zombie villager]] held captive behind [[iron bars]]. A sign near them asks to cure the [[zombie villager]]. To cure the zombie villager, use the [[splash potion]] of [[weakness]] found on the brewing stand together with the [[golden apple]] in the loot [[chest]]. After weakening and feeding the zombie villager, it displays golden particle effects and eventually converts to a regular villager.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Pillager Outpost}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Plains}}

* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga Hills}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}(unused)
| An assortment of structures spawning [[pillager]]s. The main feature of interest is the watchtower: a tall structure built with wood and cobblestone that generates a loot [[chest]] on the top. Located around the watchtower are up to four small structures, including tents, target scarecrows, and wooden cages sometimes containing an [[iron golem]] or a group of up to 3 [[allay]]s.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Jungle Pyramid}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Jungle}}
* {{BiomeLink|Bamboo Jungle}}{{only|java|short=1}}
* {{BiomeLink|Jungle Hills}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}(unused)
| Overgrown [[cobblestone]] structures containing two loot chests, with one trapped with two [[dispenser]]s firing [[arrow]]s by [[redstone]] and the other hidden behind a [[lever]] puzzle. Setting the correct combination for the [[lever]] puzzle moves a block on the main floor, revealing a hidden cavity and the [[chest]].
|-
| {{EnvLink|Swamp Hut}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Swamp}}
| Also known as witch huts. They are small wooden buildings on top of log stilts containing a [[cauldron]] and [[crafting table]]. Each Swamp Hut spawns [[witch]]es. Upon their generation, one black [[cat]] and one witch occupy the structure's area and the mobs do not despawn naturally. The huts can be used to create a witch farm, as replacement witches spawn automatically.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Village}}

* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga Hills}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}(unused)
| A town full of houses and job sites inhabited by [[villager]]s with random professions and up to two [[iron golem]]s defending the village. They are constructed with a wide variety of materials, depending on the biome that they generate in. Although village buildings do not have variants for [[jungle]] and [[swamp]] biomes, villagers wear different outfits when spawning in said biomes.

| A run-down variant of the regular village also known as a "Zombie Village." Houses no longer have torches, some blocks are broken and replaced with [[cobweb]]s, and all the villagers are [[Zombie Villager|zombified]]. Additionally, no [[iron golem]]s spawn; however, [[cat]]s still spawn with generation of the structure.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Woodland Mansion}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Dark Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|Pale Garden}}
* {{BiomeLink|Dripstone Caves}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}(very rare)
* {{BiomeLink|Lush Caves}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}(Very rare)

| Massive, systematically-generated buildings constructed with [[dark oak]] and a cobblestone foundation. They contain [[Woodland Mansion#Rooms|many rooms]] (some hidden) and loot [[chest]]s scattered across their three floors, and are inhabited by [[vindicator]]s and [[evoker]]s that do not naturally despawn or respawn when defeated. [[Allay]]s can sometimes be found in prison cells.

|-
| {{EnvLink|Nether Fossil}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Soul Sand Valley}}
| [[Fossil]] variants that are more incomplete and purely composed of [[bone block]]s. {{IN|Bedrock}}, it is a feature rather than a structure feature. [[Dried Ghast|Dried Ghasts]] may also generate near Nether Fossils.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Ruined Portal}}
| Any Nether biomes
| An incomplete [[Nether portal]] constructed with various types of [[stone]] or [[blackstone]] materials when generating in the [[Overworld]] or [[the Nether]] respectively. They can generate in varying sizes and positions. A [[netherrack]] platform underneath, as well as a loot chest and a few gold blocks, often generates.
|}

== The End ==
{{main|The End}}

|}

== Structure-like features ==
{{main|Feature}}
These world generation features share similarities with structures but are generated in the same manner as trees and ores. They will generate even when the "Generate Structures" [[Create New World|option]]{{Only|java|short=JE}} is disabled. These cannot be located using the {{cmd|locate}} command.

{| class=wikitable
! Features
! [[Biome|Biome(s)]]
! Description

They are typically connected to underground caves but may generate above ground or intersected with true structures such as [[mineshaft]]s or [[stronghold]]s. Monster rooms were formerly known as dungeons.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Desert Well}}
|
* {{BiomeLink|Desert}}
| Small [[sandstone]] feature holding [[water]] in their center cavity. They do not generate [[gold]] or treasure as part of their generation, but the water can be used as an infinite [[water source]]. Contains [[suspicious sand]] blocks that can be [[brush]]ed.
|-

|}

== Removed structures ==
These are structures that have been removed or exist only in older versions of ''[[Minecraft]]''.

{| class=wikitable
! Structure
! [[Biome|Biome(s)]]
! Description
|-
| {{EnvLink|Brick Pyramid}}
| Anywhere, since biomes did not exist at the time.
| A giant pyramid that had no interior and was made solely out of bricks. The official name for this structure is unknown. Was removed in [[Java Edition Infdev 20100327]].
|-
| {{BlockLink|link=Glass pillar|Glass|Glass Pillar}}
| Any [[Overworld]] biome.
| A tall, 1×1 glass pillar that stretched from the End portal room in the stronghold all the way to the build limit. According to Jeb, it was a debug feature that he forgot to remove. It was removed in the version [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4]].
|-
| {{EnvLink|link=Starting house|Starting-house|Starting House}}
| Anywhere on the [[Java Edition Indev]] world.
| Used to serve as the spawn location for the player during the Indev phase. The first edition of this house was made of mossy cobblestone, but later it was changed to wooden planks. It also included two chests with various items, which was later removed.
|-
| {{EnvLink|Monolith}}
| Anywhere during [[Java Edition Infdev|Infdev]].
| Chunk-sized patches of terrain that would generate up to the height limit. They were never intended to be in the game as they were just a "glitch". Monoliths were patched in the version [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.0 (preview)|Alpha v1.2.0 Preview]].
|-
| {{EnvLink|Nether Reactor}}{{only|be|short=1}}
| Anywhere, as it's built by the player.
| A player-built structure that would turn into the "Nether Spire", and would give the player access to unobtainable items. The reason for its addition is because [[the Nether]] did not exist {{in|Pocket}} back then. It was then removed after the addition of the Nether in ''Pocket Edition''.
|-
| {{EnvLink|link=Bedrock Edition removed features#Nether Spires|Nether-spire|Nether Spire}}{{only|be|short=1}}
| Anywhere where the [[Nether reactor]] was built.
| A tall and round structure that spawned over the Nether reactor. It was made out of [[obsidian]], which was later changed to [[netherrack]]. It would spawn various [[zombie pigmen]] and items from [[the Nether]]. Its purpose was to enable the players on ''Pocket Edition'' to obtain certain items, since the Nether was not implemented yet.
|-
| {{EnvLink|link=Obsidian wall|Obsidian Wall}}
| Anywhere, since it stretched toward every direction.
| A 2 block tall obsidian wall that was present during some versions of the Infdev phase. It started in the middle of the world, and stretched toward north, south, west and east. This structure doesn't have an official name.
|-
|}

== Generation ==
{{main|World generation#Features and structures}}

Structures are generated for a given chunk after the terrain has been formed. The [[chunk format]] includes a tag called {{cd|TerrainPopulated}} that indicates whether structures whose "point of origin" is in that chunk have been generated. If it is false or missing, it generates again. Structure generation is based on what is already in the chunk, so (for example) flagging a chunk that has already been populated for repopulation approximately doubles the amount of ore in it. When structures are generated, they can spill over into neighboring chunks that have been previously generated.
