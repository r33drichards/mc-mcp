== Additions ==
=== General ===
* Getting stuck inside [[block]]s causes [[suffocation]].
* The [[player]]’s hand now displays again.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Cobblestone JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Cobblestone]]'''
* Flowing [[water]] that touches flowing [[lava]] creates [[cobblestone]], which makes it renewable.

'''[[File:Ladder (S) JE1.png|32px]] [[Ladder]]s'''
* Are no longer destroyed by water.

'''[[File:Lava JE12.png|32px]] [[Lava]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Lava JE11.png|32px]].
* Lava will destroy any plant ([[rose]], [[dandelion]], [[sapling]], [[red mushroom]], [[brown mushroom]], or [[wheat]]) it flows into.
* Lava springs don't spread.
* Lava no longer generates at the bedrock level.

'''[[File:Obsidian JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Obsidian]]'''
* Flowing water that touches standing lava turns the lava into [[obsidian]].

'''[[File:Water JE10.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Changed texture from [[File:Water JE9.png|32px]].
* Water will destroy any plant ([[rose]], [[dandelion]], [[sapling]], [[red mushroom]], [[brown mushroom]], or [[wheat]]) it flows into.
* Water flows nicer.

=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Made massive tweaks to the pending tile tick logic (used for liquids and fire), quite possibly fixing a crash bug.
* Removed the infinite lava sea from under the world (removed when updating, replaces layer 0 with the void).
* Surface springs.

'''[[Caves]]'''
* Caves are even more regional, with lava areas being possible but rare.
* Springs, both water and lava, are more common.
* Increased variety in tunnel thickness, increasing the odds of branches.
* Added natural [[gravel]] and [[dirt]] underground for more varied caves.
'''[[Ore]]s'''
* Prior to this version, all ores were generated with a random amount of veins regardless to the type of ore.

=== General ===
'''General'''
* Layer 0 can now have blocks placed in it.

== Fixes ==
'''3 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed a few bugs in liquid spreading code.{{info needed|too vague - should be replaced with examples}}
* Fixed a bug where [[log]]s would not generate inside of the tops of trees.
* Fixed invisible waterfalls.</onlyinclude>
