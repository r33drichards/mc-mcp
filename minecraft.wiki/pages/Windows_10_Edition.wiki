'''''Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition''''' was the former title of {{el|be}} for the {{w|Universal Windows Platform}} developed by [[Mojang Studios]] and {{w|Xbox Game Studios}}.<ref name="MojangBlog">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150704220210/https://mojang.com/2015/07/announcing-minecraft-windows-10-edition-beta/ Announcing: Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta] - Mojang.com; July 4, 2015</ref><ref name="Windows10UniversalApps">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150121193023/http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/01/21/the-next-generation-of-windows-windows-10/ The next generation of Windows: Windows 10] - Windows (Blogging Windows); January 21, 2015</ref> It runs on devices running Windows 10 or later, as well as the {{w|Microsoft HoloLens|HoloLens}}.<ref name="Minecon2015 BehindTheScenes">{{twl|6949826|Minecon 2015 - Day Two|Mojang|July 05, 2015}} <small>(timestamp needed)</small></ref><ref name="TommasoReddit">https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3c3e5m/announcing_minecraft_windows_10_edition_beta/csry0j5</ref><ref name="TommasoTweet">{{tweet|_tomcc|617337976239091712|well it has all features, it's the same.

It was announced on July 4, 2015, and a beta version was released on July 29, 2015, for £7.69, US$9.99, or €9.89 on the Microsoft Store. People who have purchased ''[[Java Edition]]'' before October 19, 2018, got ''Windows 10 Edition'' for free.<ref>{{tweet|minecraft|1052589804896931840|Heads up, miners and crafters!

== Development ==
Before its official announcement on the [[Mojang blog]], various promotional videos of Minecraft running universally on the HoloLens were shown by Microsoft.<ref name="HoloLensPromotion">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150121194205/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThCr0PsyuA Microsoft HoloLens - Transform your world with holograms] - Microsoft on YouTube; January 21, 2015</ref> An edition of Minecraft running on Windows 10 was later demoed publicly at the {{w|Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015}} convention, where [[Lydia Winters]] on a {{w|Microsoft Surface|Surface Pro}} and a Microsoft employee on the HoloLens were both playing and interacting with the game.<ref name="HoloLens-E32015">{{ytl|3TJEuSiMo0A|Microsoft Press Conference - E3 2015|GameSpot|June 15, 2015|t=1h42m53s}}</ref>

At MINECON 2015, some additional insight was given into the development of ''Windows 10 Edition''. It was explained that due to being a universal app, it was not possible to run {{el|je}} as Microsoft does not support universal apps in Java.<ref name="Minecon2015 BehindTheScenes" />

== Gameplay ==
{{Main|Pocket Edition#Gameplay|title1=Bedrock Edition Gameplay}}

In addition to features existing in {{el|be}}, the ''Windows 10 Edition'' also can play with up to seven players using Xbox Live and also others using {{el|be}} through [[Realms]] or local multiplayer with an [[Pocket Edition Alpha 0.12.1|update that was released]] shortly after the initial beta version.

Some other additional exclusive features include multiple control schemes, a player feedback feature, and the ability to record and share gameplay with Windows 10's built in Game DVR.<ref name="MojangBlog"/><ref name="TommasoTweet2">{{tweet|_tomcc|617334672272588800|That means that MCPE is going to get a lot of features, and that Win10 and MCPE players will be able to play together :)|July 4, 2015}}</ref>

Interestingly, the [[Far Lands]] do not generate at all on ''Windows 10 Edition'', although they do on the regular {{el|pe}}.{{citation needed}}

== Other platforms ==
=== Microsoft HoloLens ===
[[File:MinecraftHoloLens-RealityMode-E32015.png|350px|thumb|Minecraft on HoloLens in "reality" mode atop a table with [[Lydia Winters]]' world at E3 2015]]
[[Jens Bergensten]] initially tweeted after Microsoft's Windows 10 event on January 21, 2015, that a holographic edition of Minecraft was being developed. It was stated that two Minecraft projects were being made, one being "a toy" and the other being "closer to the game."<ref name="JebHoloLensTweet">{{tweet|jeb_|557993513976344577|I've tried 2 Minecraft projects on #HoloLens. One is a toy, one is closer to the game, both are awesome! Very much wip, but definitely real|January 21, 2015}}</ref>

A {{w|Microsoft HoloLens|HoloLens}} and a Surface Pro 3 could be seen at Microsoft's segment at the E3 2015 convention, wherein both devices demoed were running the ''Windows 10 Edition'' of Minecraft and were seamlessly playing together.<ref name="HoloLens-E32015" />

Two different playable modes were shown, one being a "wall" mode where a player can use an Xbox controller to interact and play with a conventional Minecraft world that was being projected holographically onto a wall. It is possible to resize the projection and also to fix the projection into place, which allows for peering through from the left or right to get a different perspective similar to that of a window without the need for a controller.<ref name="EngadgetMineconDemo">[http://engadget.com/2015/07/08/minecraft-hololens-minecon I played 'Minecraft' with Microsoft's HoloLens] - Engadget; July 8, 2015</ref> The other was a "reality" mode in which players can project a world in 3D atop of real-world objects, such as a table, without the need for a controller.

In reality mode, players are able to use voice commands and hand gestures, among other features of the headset, to interact with the world. It is possible to target specific areas of the map with voice commands by glancing toward them. For example, looking directly at an object and using a command such as "lightning strike" would summon a lightning bolt relative to that area. Another example is the ability to "markup" an area by looking at an object, which creates a vertical beam of light similar to [[Beacon]]s. Voice commands can also be used to change the view of the world and allow for following a player with modes such as "close up" or "overview" to change how close the camera is to the player. Hand gestures such as pinching can be used to zoom into a particular area, pan around the world, and also to move the world vertically.

=== Oculus Rift ===
{{main|Virtual reality}}
The Windows 10 Edition can run on the Oculus Rift, via a [https://oculus.com/experiences/rift/741306562635466 free download from the Oculus Store].

On September 24, 2015, it was announced that ''Minecraft'' would be coming to the {{w|Oculus Rift}},<ref>{{tweet|oculus|647103412576718848|We're thrilled to announce Minecraft for the #Rift!
