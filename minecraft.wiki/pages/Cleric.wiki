A '''cleric''' is a [[villager]] that [[trade]]s magic items like [[ender pearl]]s, [[redstone dust]], [[glowstone]], and other enchanting or potion ingredients. Clerics wear a purple robe featuring a creeper emblem on the back.

== Spawning ==
{{Main|Villager#Spawning}}
An unemployed [[villager]] turns into a cleric when an unclaimed [[brewing stand]] is nearby.

=== Natural generation ===
{{Main|Villager#Natural generation}}
{{See also|Village/Structure}}
The workstation of clerics, the [[brewing stand]], spawns in temples in [[villages]].

=== Igloos ===
[[Igloo]] basements always generate with one villager in the left cell and one [[zombie villager]] in the right cell. There is also a [[brewing stand]] in an igloo basement.

{{IN|Java}}, the generated zombie villager is always a cleric, but becomes unemployed once cured. The villager is always unemployed. The brewing stand can turn an unemployed villager into a cleric once it can pathfind to it.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, the villager has a random profession and the zombie villager is unemployed. The villager can change its profession to cleric due to the nearby brewing stand; the same applies to the zombie villager once it is cured.

== Drops ==
{{Main|Hero of the Village#Gifts}}
{{IN|java}}, a cleric can drop various items by throwing them as a gift towards a nearby player with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect. The gift is randomly selected from the following list:
*{{ItemLink|Lapis Lazuli}}
*{{ItemLink|Redstone Dust}}
