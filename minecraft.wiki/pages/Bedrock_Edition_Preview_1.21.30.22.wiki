*The name of the Stone Mason [[villager]] profession has been renamed to Mason to match {{JE}}.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Resource Pack|Resource]] and [[Behavior Pack]]s'''
*The player's {{cd|helmet_layer_visible}} variable is now based on the result of the {{cd|has_head_gear}} [[Molang]] query and the player and persona render controller's part visibility for the helmet layer no longer checks for the existence of head gear. 
**This fixes attachable scripts setting the {{cd|helmet_layer_visible}} to 1.0 to now properly work and maintains a fix that prevents persona hair and head gear from clipping outside of mob and [[Pumpkin]] heads.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "Upcoming Creator Features" experimental toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[Block]]s'''
* Added new experimental field {{cd|item_specific_speeds}} to {{cd|minecraft:destructible_by_mining}} block component.
'''[[API]]'''
* {{cd|ItemUseOnBeforeEvent}}
** Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value will be true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false on events triggered from holding the interaction button.
* {{cd|ItemUseOnAfterEvent}}
** Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value will be true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false on events triggered from holding the interaction button.
'''Graphical'''
* Added the ability to data-drive water parameters in the Deferred Technical Preview.
* Added a new feature to the Deferred Technical Preview: realistic waves. This new feature must be opted into via a resource pack and will not be enabled by default.
