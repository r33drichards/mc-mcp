'''Happy Ghast Music Video''' (stylized as '''HAPPY GHAST MUSIC VIDEO'''), also called '''Happy Ghast Song'''<ref>{{citation|url=https://open.spotify.com/track/1VOT5tVZlAGhqLsuB61dQN|title=Happy Ghast Song|section=|website=[https://open.spotify.com/ Spotify]|author=[[Mojang Studios]]|date=October 10, 2025|quote=Happy Ghast Song|archive-url=}}</ref> and '''Happy Ghast song''',<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1976722515612647761|Happy Ghast song is available to stream wherever you listen to music!<br><br>Listen Here: aka.ms/HappyGhastSong|October 10, 2025}}</ref> is a music video about the [[happy ghast]] played during [[Minecraft LIVE – September 2025]]. The number revolves around [[Efe]] raising a happy ghast, going on several one to two second long misadventures in the process.

== Summary ==
[[Efe]] is mining [[copper ore]], only for a [[happy ghast]] to appear. In a library Efe hugs the ghast, but gets squished up against [[bookshelves]]. The ghast creeps behind a [[cherry]] tree, and then unknowingly begins hitting Efe with tentacles. The two begin flying up into the sky, over a [[badlands]] biome, and then into a [[village]] where Efe steals a [[bed]] for no apparent reason. Two warm animals look up at the sky, while two horses race by it, and then Efe gets mobbed by a clutter of [[Cave Spider|spiders]] in a [[mineshaft]].

In a birch forest, Efe crafts a [[harness]] and equips it on the ghast, allowing their friends [[Kai]], [[Noor]], and [[Alex]] to fly with them. From there Steve and Alex get their own ghasts, while Efe begins carrying several [[mobs]] in [[boats]] "for a party." On the ground a [[villager]] flees from the boat, and ends up being caught in one against their will. The happy ghast flies with [[bees]], and then serves as an umbrella for Efe, before Efe gets knocked off a [[mountain]] by a [[goat]]. An [[armadillo]] is startled by the suddenly appearing ghast, and then [[Zuri]] leaps into water for an unstated reason. From there Efe fights against [[illagers]] in a burning [[forest]], again without an apparent context.

The scene cuts to Efe running with a [[dried ghast]] from a regular [[ghast]] and [[piglins]], before returning to the [[Overworld]], where Efe is ready to kill several [[cow]]. [[Makena]] tethers a bee to the happy ghast, alongside several other mobs, before they suddenly disappear when Efe flies through an arch into the sky. Suddenly, all nine heroes appear, on their own happy ghasts. Using crossbows, they aim up towards the clouds, and set off a show of [[fireworks]]. Efe and the happy ghast fly through, setting off more fireworks, and then return to the arch to fly through it again.

=== Lyrics ===
<poem><i>Happy Ghast!

(It's so happy!)

Who's that big marshmallow

with a smiley face?

It's very very friendly

but takes up all your space.

(It's cozy!)

Who's that floaty friend-cube

with it's many limbs?

Look at these DANGLY THINGS!

It's a Happy Ghast! Happy Ghast!

Doo doo doo doo doo!

Happy Ghast! Happy Ghast!

Doo doo doo doo doo!

Craft yourself a harness

we'll go for a ride.

Grab some of your friends

let's travel far and wide.

Drifting through the clouds

on our flying mount we float!

There's even room to party

downstairs in the boats.

Happy Ghast! Happy Ghast!

Doo doo doo doo doo!

Happy Ghast! Happy Ghast!

Doo doo doo doo doo!

From the Nether,

wearing leather,

mobs can tether

all together,

soaring so high,

clouds will pass by.

Rise up! Lets fly!

and chase the sky!

Chase the sky!

They are Happy Ghast! Happy Ghast!

Doo doo doo doo doo!

Happy Ghast! Happy Ghast!

Doo doo doo doo doo!

Chase the sky!</i></poem>

== Trivia ==
* In a Twitter post, it is claimed that the song may cause people to hum it for hours.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1971987304274141603|Interrupting your #MinecraftLIVE for a quick jam sesh.<br> ⚠️ Side effects may include humming for hours.|September 27, 2025|archive=|archiveid=}}</ref>
* There is a reference in the song to the game drop that brought the Happy Ghast, [[Chase the Skies]].
* This is the fourth musical-based video, after [[The Super Duper Minecraft Musical]], [[Caves & Cliffs: The Musical]], and [[A Warden's Song]].
* Prior to the video's release, [[Marc Watson]] jokingly gave lyrics to a similar song, also about ghasts.<ref>{{Bluesky|marc-irl.bsky.social|3ll6y4ioee226|For all the ghast enjoyers out there, if I have to have this in my head, you now do too. 😂|March 25, 2025}}</ref>

=== Errors ===

* During a shot with three happy ghasts, at 0:35, two separate Alexes can be seen. One on Efe's ghast, the other on their own, opposite to Steve's.
