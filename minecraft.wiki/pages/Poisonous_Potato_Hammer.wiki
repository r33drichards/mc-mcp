A '''poisonous potato hammer''' is a joke [[weapon]], added in [[24w14potato]]. 

It is visually similar to [[Potatiesh, Greatstaff of the Peasant]], being a compressed [[Poisonous Potato]] rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise atop a [[blaze rod]].

== Usage ==
Poisonous potato hammer has an attack damage of 11, one more than an unenchanted netherite axe, and an [[attack speed]] of 6, allowing the player to hit nearly four times faster than a [[sword]]. This allows it to strike faster than the [[Damage#Immunity|immunity period]] of a single target, during which the target can't receive consecutive damage. It comes enchanted with [[Knockback]] X and, unlike other weapons, doesn't lose [[durability]] when used. The Knockback enchantment can be removed via a [[grindstone]], but no other enchantment can be applied to the hammer in Survival mode, either through an enchanting table or an anvil. It does not do [[sweep attack]]s.

When used to damage an entity, it has a 30% chance of throwing an extended [[lingering potion]] of [[Poison]] at the entity. The potion is thrown with speed relative to knockback taken by the attacked entity; if it's immune to knockback (like [[iron golem]]s), potion is spawned with no horizontal speed, and falls onto the player's feet.

=== Creative mode ===
Players in [[Creative]] mode holding the poisonous potato hammer are unable to break blocks, just like with a sword.
