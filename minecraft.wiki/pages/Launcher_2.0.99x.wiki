}}'''2.0.995''' ([[wikipedia:Microsoft Windows|Windows]]) or '''2.0.996''' ([[wikipedia:macOS|macOS]]) is an update to the [[Minecraft launcher|launcher]] released on October 25, 2017.

== Changes ==

** The previous property <code>minecraftArguments</code>, which was at the end of the file, was changed to <code>arguments</code> at the beginning of the file.
*** The new property no longer contains call parameters as text lines. Instead it is no longer a text, but an object, which contains every call parameter as sub-property.
