'''Tiny Jens''' is a miniaturized doppelgänger of [[Jens Bergensten]], who typically appeared during [[Community Vote|Community Votes]]. Although similar in personality and appearance to the primary Jens, Tiny Jens was shown consistently to be a separate entity, spending much of his time with [[Tiny Agnes]].

== Appearance ==
Tiny Jens is a caricature of Jens, featuring a comically large forehead and his signature red hair. Below black glasses is a thick mustache, behind his head a ponytail, and clothes vaguely resembling [[Steve]]'s. The most immediately obvious difference between him and his namesake are the proportions, with Tiny Jens being a "chibi" design.

Beginning with [[Minecraft Live 2020]], Tiny Jens would start wearing different costumes for different situations. While climbing up a [[Mountains|mountain]], he would wear a purple coat, with gray clothes, and a yellow and gray headband. While snorkeling, he and Tiny Agnes would wear near identical outfits, with a snorkel, swimsuit, and flippers. The only difference is hers were accented purple, while his were chartreuse.

In the [[2022 Mob Vote Event]], Jens would wear a suit of [[armor]] to test visitors to the server; in actuality, a suit of cardboard. The [[helmet]] was a box with a visible flap on the back, the [[shield]] the side of a box, [[boots]] made of two smaller boxes, a whole box encompassing his [[chestplate]], and a [[sword]] without any practical edge. In a parkour course, he also wore exercise clothes predominately colored blue and white, consisting of a muscle shirt, shorts, sneakers, and a headband.

In [[Eerie Mojang Office Party]], he's rendered more in-line with typical ''Minecraft'' characters, with proportionate proportions. His head closely resembles his "Tiny" appearance, but now grown, with the plain clothes taking up far more space.

== Personality ==
Tiny Jens serves as something of a self-parody of Jens, being depicted as cowardly and nervous, but very friendly and inviting. In skits, he will often be the butt of a joke, typically reacting to a new [[mob]] or getting lost in a [[biome]].

== Powers and abilities ==
During the [[Biome chooser|Biome Chooser]] informational videos, Tiny Jens is shown teleporting beside a [[stone]] frame. During the lead up to [[Minecraft Live 2023]], Jens is shown to possess the strength to ride a boat on land. Although it takes several days to encounter an [[armadillo]], he is still shown moving rather fast and with only mild irritation to the repetitive task. After encountering the armadillo, he continues rowing at a much faster pace, if not slightly quicker than walking.

== Biography ==
{{Expand section}}
During the lead up to [[MINECON Earth 2018]], Tiny Jens and Agnes embarked on a mission to promote the biomes players could vote for during the event. Beginning in a [[desert]], Tiny Agnes voiced the opinion that they needed palm trees, "and some [[Meerkat|friendly guys]] to keep things interesting." Tiny Jens assumed that meerkats were [[Cat|cats]] and handed over a [[fish]], becoming so embarrassed that he ran away to the [[taiga]] in a panic. Upon arriving in the taiga, Jens placed down a campfire, before a skulk of [[Fox|foxes]] appeared, frightening Tiny Agnes. When asked for reassurance they wouldn't be hostile, Tiny Jens remarked that they "hadn't decided." The final destination was the [[savanna]], where Jens scoffed at Agnes' interest in [[Baobab|baobabs]], preferring to fascinate over [[Termite|termites]].

The following year, Tiny Jens almost collided with a [[tumbleweed]]. Upon dodging it, he would prick his finger on a [[cactus]] spike. Appearing in a [[swamp]], Tiny Agnes introduced him to a [[Boat with Chest|boat with chest]] and [[frog]], before he introduced the [[mangrove]] tree. As Tiny Agnes grew intimidated by the frog, the two awkwardly fled the biome, resurfacing in a mountain. Almost immediately after entering, Tiny Agnes would fall and freeze inside [[Powder Snow|powder snow]]. A [[goat]] then appeared, but quickly fled the scene, the duo chasing after it.

The next year was a change of pace, as Jens decided to show off his board game collection, before Tiny Agnes steered the topic to the [[Mob Vote]]. The first stop on this expedition was the [[Flower Forest|flower forest]], where Jens found the [[moobloom]] very cute, as it befriended a [[bee]]. However, he became nervous of whether he and Agnes were friends. Returning to the mountain, Jens introduced the [[iceologer]], oblivious to Agnes' misfortune freezing. The next stop would be the [[Deep Warm Ocean|ocean]], where Jens and Agnes became hypnotized by a [[Glow Squid|glow squid]], before crossing paths with [[Tiny Vu]].

Following the glow squid's victory, 2021 would continue with another mob vote. This time, Tiny Jens and Agnes began trekking through a [[Birch Forest|birch forest]] on their way to the "Minecraft Live Studio," not knowing which mobs were selected. In order to check, Tiny Jens pulled out a cell phone and contacted Tiny Vu, who conveniently knew the candidates. However, Agnes ended up falling into a [[cave]], leaving Jens to try and locate her.<ref>{{YouTube link|2BCFGjsrwyY|Minecraft Live 2021: Introducing new mobs!|Minecraft|October 10, 2021}}</ref> While assessing the situation, Jens encountered an [[allay]], before hearing an echo of Agnes from inside a pit. At the bottom, the two reunited in a laboratory where Agnes had found a [[Copper Golem|copper golem]], using a new one to activate an elevator up to the surface. Returning to the studio, Jens apparently forgot how the vote system worked, before the two encountered a [[glare]] and marveled at the wonders of [[Copper Ingot|copper]].<ref>{{YouTube link|s58orudNZ94|Minecraft Live 2021: Vote for the next new mob!|Minecraft|October 14, 2021}}</ref>

In 2022, Tiny Vu recruited Tiny Jens and Agnes to help him investigate mysterious occurrences piling up across the [[Overworld]]. Fearing the worst, he told them to try solving the mystery before [[Minecraft Live 2022]], Jens suspecting these actions were the work of mobs trying to "get our attention."<ref>{{YouTube link|vWFxQ6_ZlxE|Minecraft Live 2022: The Mob Vote is Back!|Minecraft|October 3, 2022}}</ref> Their first priority was to investigate [[Ocean Ruins|ocean ruins]], where Jens recovered a [[Sniffer Egg|sniffer egg]]. Mistaking it for a [[chicken]] as it hatched, Agnes explained that [[Sniffer|sniffers]] were ancient, and the two agreed to help repopulate them. Their next stop was a [[mineshaft]], where Jens recognized the [[rascal]] and explained its behavior, earning a [[Iron Pickaxe|pickaxe]] from it. Their final stop was Vu's art collection, where they uncovered [[Tuff Golem|tuff golems]] holding his hat, confirming the rumors about them. Once the problem was solved, the three mobs were brought into Vu's study to assess their features.<ref>{{YouTube link|rXCDPgUhcr8|Minecraft Live 2022: Which Mob Gets Your Vote?|Minecraft|October 7, 2022}}</ref>

* Due to widespread concerns over her opinion on Tiny Jens thanks to the moobloom video, Minecraft Live 2020 had to clarify that Tiny Agnes values and respects him as a friend.<ref>{{YouTube link|DWZIfsaIgtE|Minecraft Live 2020: Full Show|Minecraft|October 3, 2020}}</ref>
* Inside Tiny Jens' mind, he apparently frequently thinks about lunch, lunch offerings, negotiating lunch, and the [[Nether Update]].<ref>{{YouTube link|abs30d44yzg|Adding a New Mob: How We Make Minecraft - Episode 1|Minecraft|July 31, 2020}}</ref>
