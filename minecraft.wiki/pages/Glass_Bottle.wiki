A '''glass bottle''' is an [[item]] that can hold [[water]], [[potion]]s, [[Honey Bottle|honey]], or [[dragon's breath]].

== Obtaining ==
Glass bottles can be obtained by crafting, drinking from bottles, or from [[witch]] drops.

=== Mob loot ===

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A2= Glass
|C2= Glass
|B3= Glass
|Output= Glass Bottle,3
|type= Brewing
}}

=== Drinking ===
Drinking a [[potion]] or [[honey bottle]] returns the empty glass bottle. Throwing a splash potion or a lingering potion does not return a glass bottle, but brewing a lingering potion gives back a glass bottle.

=== Mud ===
{{control|Using}} a [[water bottle]], [[splash water bottle]] or [[lingering water bottle]] on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], or [[rooted dirt]] transform it into a [[mud]] block, at the same time leaving the player with an empty glass bottle.

=== Cauldrons ===
{{control|Using}} a water bottle (or, {{in|bedrock}}, a potion, splash potion, or lingering potion) on a [[cauldron]] that is not yet full adds that liquid to the cauldron, leaving the player with an empty glass bottle.

== Usage ==
Glass bottles can be filled to make [[water bottle]]s, which can then be [[brewed]] into [[potion]]s in a [[brewing stand]].

=== Collecting liquids ===
==== Water ====
A bottle may be filled with water by holding it in the hand and {{control|using}} it on a [[water]] source block or a [[cauldron]] that has water in it. It can also be filled using a waterlogged block.{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-83420}}</ref>

Also, a bottle may be filled by powering a [[dispenser]] containing a bottle and pointed at a water source block. This does not work with cauldrons.<ref>{{bug|MC-165196|||Invalid}}</ref>

If filled via a water source, the water is unaffected. If filled via a cauldron, {{frac|1|3}} of the water in the cauldron is removed. Therefore, using a cauldron to fill water bottles is inefficient, except in [[the Nether]] where it is normally the only way to fill bottles.

==== Potion ====
{{IN|bedrock}}, a bottle may be filled with potion by {{control|using}} it on a [[cauldron]] containing potion. When the bottle is filled, {{frac|1|3}} of the cauldron's potion is removed.

==== Honey ====
If a [[bee nest]] or [[beehive]] is full, the player can {{control|use}} a glass bottle on the block, or may power a [[dispenser]] that contains a bottle and is pointed at the block, which empties the block and creates a [[honey bottle]]. Honey bottles can also be emptied by using them in crafting recipes (such as [[sugar]] or [[honey block]]). However, a lingering potion use on tipped arrow recipe does not give the bottle back.

==== Dragon's breath ====
{{control|Using}} a glass bottle in cloud emitted when the [[ender dragon]] breathes or shoots a [[dragon fireball]] fills the bottle with [[dragon's breath]].

When put 2 or more dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, a glass bottle drops as an [[Item (entity)|entity]]. However, if put only 1 dragon's breath in the brewing stand, after the brewing process, the glass bottle is consumed and cannot be retrieved.<ref>{{bug|MC-259583}}</ref>
