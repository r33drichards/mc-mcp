| FOV
| A value that controls how much of the game world is visible on the screen. Also known as Field of View.
In Minecraft, the FOV value represents how many degrees of vertical vision the player gets without modifying effects such as sprinting, flying or status effects. Note that other games' FOV setting might represent different angles, meaning that using the same FOV value across different games can yield different results. The table below shows how Minecraft's FOV setting affects horizontal field of view in different display aspect ratios.

*'''''Fabulous!''''' graphics uses screen shaders for drawing weather, clouds and particles behind translucent blocks and water. This may severely impact performance for portable devices (e.g. laptops) and 4K displays.
*'''Fancy''' enables higher quality graphic effects. Graphic effects include transparent [[leaves]], increased [[rain]] particles, a black vignette around the screen in darker areas, and the [[world border]] red warning vignette effect.
*'''Fast''' disables these effects for better performance.

|-
| Render Distance
| The render distance controls how many [[chunk]]s of the world are visible at once. The fewer chunks that are included, the faster each frame can be rendered, resulting in higher [[w:Frame rate|frame rate]].

The most distant terrain is faded into the sky color as if by fog, to avoid a sharp edge to the visible world; therefore, this option is also known as "fog".

The maximum value is 32 for 64-bit Java installs with at least 1 gigabyte of memory, and 16 in all other cases.

'''Note: ''diameter'' = ''radius × 2 + 1'' '''

| Chunk Builder
| Determines which chunk sections are updated synchronously during a single frame.

* '''Threaded''' has nearby chunks compiled in parallel threads, which may result in visual holes when blocks are destroyed.
* '''Semi Blocking''' has chunks recompile immediately when some actions occur, including placing or destroying blocks.
* '''Fully Blocking''' defaults to the behavior used prior to [[Java Edition 1.18|1.18]], in which chunks always compile immediately, which may affect performance when placing or destroying blocks.

| [[Simulation Distance]]
| [[Simulation distance]] is similar to render distance, but affects the number of chunks in which entities are updated, and blocks and fluids are ticked. Simulation distance is more taxing on performance than the equivalent level of render distance. The available values are the same as render distance, except the minimum value is 5 chunks.

| Smooth Lighting
| [[Light]]ing is smoothed across the blocks (ambient occlusion) or each block has a distinctive [[light]] level. This setting does not change the gameplay in any way, but it has a minor effect on performance.
| style="text-align: center;" | ON
|-
| Max Framerate
| Limits the frame rate (in frames per second). Limiting the frame rate to a multiple of the [[player]] monitor's refresh rate can save processing power.
| style="text-align: center;" | 120 fps
|-
| Reduce FPS when
|Limits FPS to a certain amount whether the player is AFK (away from keyboard) or the game window is minimized.
AFK: If there is no [[player]] movement for 1 minute, the frame rate will be capped at 30 FPS. When there is no movement for a total of 10 minutes, the frame rate will be capped at 10 FPS.

Minimized: When the game window is minimized, the frame rate will be capped at 10 FPS.
| style="text-align: center;" | AFK 
|-
| VSync
| Limits the player's frames per second to the screen's refresh rate, which is usually 50&nbsp;Hz, 60&nbsp;Hz, 75&nbsp;Hz, or 120 to 240&nbsp;Hz on some gaming-targeted screens. Enabling VSync fixes tearing, but increases input latency and causes stuttering if one's computer cannot draw enough frames per second.
| style="text-align: center;" | ON
|-
| View Bobbing
| Toggles the "bobbing" motion of the camera as the player is walking.
| style="text-align: center;" | ON
|-
| GUI Scale
| Controls the GUI (graphical user interface) scale. This also controls the HUD ([[heads-up display]]) size. Note that the options available to the player depends on the game resolution. The number of available GUI scales for a specific resolution can be calculated using this formula: {{code|max(1, min(floor(width / 320), floor(height / 240)))}}. A GUI scale of 1 is properly scaled using a resolution of 320×240, but smaller resolutions might cause elements to run offscreen. A GUI scale of ''n'' is available at a resolution equal to or higher than (320 * ''n'')x(240 * ''n''), so a GUI scale of 2 is available at resolution 640×480 or higher, a GUI scale of 3 is available at resolution 960×720 or higher, and so on. There is no technical limit to how many GUI scales can be available. Auto sets the GUI scale to the highest value available for the current resolution.

The GUI scale can also be changed by holding {{key|Ctrl}} and scrolling the mouse wheel in the Video Settings screen.

{{main|Telemetry}}
This option shows information on what data the game can send to Mojang, stating that it helps Mojang improve ''Minecraft'' based on info relevant to players. The "Give Feedback" button opens a link to the [[feedback site]] while "Open My Data" shows the player information on telemetry data that is sent to Mojang, with the files removed after seven days. A link to the Microsoft privacy statement can be found on this page as well. A toggle for data collection is also available, though it is impossible to disable telemetry completely without client modifications.
