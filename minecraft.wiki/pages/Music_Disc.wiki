== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
When a [[creeper]] is killed by a [[skeleton]], [[wither skeleton]], [[skeleton horse]] (via commands), [[stray]], [[bogged]], or [[parched]], it drops a random music disc from the following pool:

{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc 13|"13"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc cat|"cat"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc blocks|"blocks"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc chirp|"chirp"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc far|"far"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc mall|"mall"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc mellohi|"mellohi"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc stal|"stal"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc strad|"strad"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc ward|"ward"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc 11|"11"}}
* {{ItemLink|Music Disc wait|"wait"}}
}}

Since wither skeletons do not use [[bow]]s, they cannot attack creepers without using [[commands]], and therefore are unable to cause a creeper to drop a music disc in normal gameplay.

[[TNT]] ignited by a flaming [[arrow]] gives credit for all of the resulting kills to the entity that fired the arrow. Thus, when a skeleton ignites a TNT block by using a bow with the [[Flame]] enchantment, shooting through [[lava]] or fire, or being a wither skeleton,{{only|java}} each creeper killed by the explosion drops a music disc.<ref>{{bug|MC-210303||Creepers drop music discs even when not killed by an arrow|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-150884||Creepers drop music discs even when not killed by an arrow|WAI}}</ref>

When killed by a player-deflected [[fireball]], a [[ghast]] will always drop {{ItemLink|Music Disc Tears|Tears}}.

When a [[chicken jockey]] is killed, it will always drop {{ItemLink|Music Disc Lava Chicken|Lava Chicken}}. However, the rider must be killed before the chicken.

=== Generated loot ===
Some music discs can be found by exploring various [[structure]]s in the game. Typically, the appearance of the music disc matches the structure in which it spawns. The disc {{ItemSprite|music-disc-5}} "5" can be found only as [[disc fragment]]s, requiring 9 fragments to craft the music disc.

=== Crafting ===
{{ItemLink|Music Disc 5|"5"}} is the only disc that can be crafted.

{{Crafting usage|Disc Fragment 5}}

== Usage ==
=== Playing music ===
A music disc can be played on a [[jukebox]] by holding the disc and pressing the {{control|use}} control on the jukebox, or by using a [[hopper]] or a [[dropper]] facing toward the jukebox. Pressing {{control|use}} on the jukebox again ejects the disc and stops any music playing. Once it stops playing, the disc can also be retrieved by a hopper placed beneath the jukebox (a jukebox emits a redstone signal while the disc is playing, temporarily locking the hopper).

The in-game music disc tracks are all {{w|Monaural|monaural}} recordings. Tracks released for listening outside of the game are in {{w|Stereophonic_sound|stereo}} (though "Pigstep" has a mono version included in the [[Minecraft: Nether Update (Original Game Soundtrack)|Nether Update soundtrack EP]]).

=== Redstone signal ===
A jukebox playing music from a disc emits a level 15 signal, powering any adjacent [[redstone wire]]s, [[redstone repeater]]s, and [[mechanism component]]s. The signal turns off when the music track ends or if the disc is removed before the track ends.

If the [[player]] places a [[comparator]] besides a jukebox, the intensity of the redstone signal depends on the disc currently inserted, with the following values. The comparator is powered as long as a disc is stored inside the jukebox, even if it has stopped playing.

== Trivia ==
* The music discs resemble older 78-{{tooltip|rpm|Revolutions per minute}} {{w|phonograph records}} from the early 20th century, which were often played in jukeboxes from that era.
* Before [[The Flattening]], data values used by music discs ranged from 2256 to 2267, while all other blocks/items used the first free data value available.
* [[Jeb]] said at [[MINECON]] that the reason for the absence of the "where are we now" music disc was a bug related to the spaces in the name. It was only after the [[Java Edition 1.4.3]] update that this disc appeared in the game, but its name was changed to "wait".<ref name=":1"></ref> It has the original title {{in|LCE}}.
** Despite the name having spaces, the texture ID for "where are we now" is "record_where are we now" in [[Legacy Console Edition]]. It is the only texture resource location in the game with spaces.
* The program areas of music discs each have different materials based on where it came from, with most music discs having a casual black program area, [[Music Disc Pigstep|Pigstep]] being [[netherrack]] and [[Gold Ore|gold]], [[Music Disc 5|5]] being [[deepslate]] and [[sculk]], [[Music Disc Relic|Relic]] being [[terracotta]] and [[Packed Mud|packed mud]], [[Music Disc Creator (Music Box)|Creator (music box)]] being [[Block of Copper|copper]], [[Music Disc Creator|Creator]] being [[oxidized copper]], [[Music Disc Precipice|Precipice]] being [[tuff]] and copper with different oxidization levels, and [[Music Disc Tears|Tears]] being the "flesh" of a [[Ghast]].
