{{Quote|I...am [[Movie: Steve|Steve]].|author=Jack Black in ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'' }}{{Quote|I wouldn't expect you to believe the world I'm about to describe, although your reading these words means you're already here. Maybe you've been in this world for a while but just discovered [[The Island (location)|the island]]. Or maybe, like it was for me, the island is your introduction to the world, then you're exactly where I was on my first day. This world can seem like a maze and, sometimes, like a bully. But the truth is that it's a teacher and its trials are just lessons in disguise.
