|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3-1|slink=Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3|End portals have an unobtainable item form corresponding to its block ID, which has interesting model behavior. It can be obtained via inventory editors with numeric item ID 119.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3|End portal items have an unstable item model that changes depending on blocks that are targeted or in loaded chunks. It uses this model in inventories, when held in first or third person view or as a dropped item.
|[[File:End Portal (cube) (inventory) JE1.png|32px]] The end portal item initially uses a full cube model, like full cube blocks do.
|[[File:End Portal (flat) (inventory) JE1.png|32px]] If a placed end portal block is targeted,{{info needed|is targeting required or can a chunk containing one just be loaded?}} the item model changes to a flat plane, matching the shape of the wireframe outline box that can be seen near the bottom of an end portal block when targeted.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4|[[File:Grass Block (top texture) JE3 BE1.png|32px]] The end portal item now uses this texture in inventories, when held in first or third person view or as a dropped item.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5|[[File:Grass Block (top texture) JE4 BE2.png|32px]] The end portal item now uses this texture in inventories, when held in first or third person view or as a dropped item.
|This is due to the grass top texture changing in this version.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4.2|dev=12w34a|The end portal item now uses the aforementioned texture when in an item frame.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.5|dev=13w02a|[[File:End Portal (inventory) JE4.gif|32px]] The end portal item now uses this texture in inventories, when held in first or third person view, as a dropped item or when in an item frame.
|This is due to major texture storage changes in this version.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w42a|[[File:End Portal (inventory) JE5.png|32px]] End portal items now appear translucent in the inventory. As a dropped item, in a player's hand, or in an item frame, they still appear opaque.
|This is due to changes in item rendering in this version.
|''NOTE: the end portal item was still animated in this version. However, the provided image appears stationary due to technical limitations.''}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w05a|[[File:Missing Texture JE3.png|32px]] The end portal item now uses this texture in inventories, when held in first or third person view, as a dropped item or when in an item frame.}}
