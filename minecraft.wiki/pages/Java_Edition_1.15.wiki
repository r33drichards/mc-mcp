'''[[File:Beehive (S) JE1.png|width=32x32]] [[Beehive]]'''
* Can be crafted using 6 [[planks]] and 3 [[honeycomb]]s.
* Can house [[bee]]s.
* Fills up with honey.
** The amount of honey in the beehive increases as bees gather nectar and return to their hive.
** The player can harvest [[honeycomb]]s and [[honey bottle]]s from the hive {{ctrl|using}} [[shears]] and [[glass bottle]]s respectively.
** If the player breaks or harvests honey from the hive, the bees become hostile on the [[player]].
*** Bees inside the hive don't turn hostile if it is harvested with [[Silk Touch]], but bees outside the hive do.
*** Bees don't turn hostile if there is a lit [[campfire]] or [[fire]] underneath the hive when honeycombs or honey bottles are harvested. 
* Is a [[block entity]] and cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s.
* When instantly {{ctrl|mined}} in [[Creative]] mode, they drop as an [[item]] if they contain any bees.

'''[[File:Bee Nest (S) JE1.png|width=32x32]] [[Bee nest]]'''
* Spawn naturally in [[flower forest]]s, [[plains]], and [[sunflower plains]] biomes.
* Functions the same as [[beehive]]s, but requires [[Silk Touch]] to be collected.

'''[[File:Honey Block JE1 BE2.png|width=32x32]] [[Honey block]]'''
* Can be crafted with 4 [[honey bottle]]s.
** The bottles are not consumed and remain in the crafting grid.
* Stickier than [[slime block]]s:
** [[Player]]s' {{control|jump}} height is drastically reduced.
** Players walk very slow and cannot {{control|sprint}} on them.
** Effect also works through non-full blocks like [[carpet]]s and [[slab]]s.
* When a honey block is pushed or pulled by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent [[block]]s in the same direction.
** Works the same way as [[slime block]]s.
** Honey blocks do not stick to slime blocks.
* If an [[entity]] is on a honey block that is pushed by a [[piston]], the entity is moved with the honey block.
* [[Entities]] touching the side of a honey block slide down slowly.
* Landing on a honey block reduces fall damage.
** Fall damage is cut to about {{frac|1|5}} of normal: equal to <code>ceiling((fall distance - 3) / 5)</code>, or in other words, {{frac|1|5}} of {{hp|1}} for every block fallen after the first 3, rounded up.
* [[Mob]]s usually avoid walking on them.
* Does not conduct redstone signals.
* [[Bee]]s occasionally 'eat' from them if {{ctrl|placed}} near [[beehive]]s or bee nests.

'''[[File:Honeycomb.png|32px]] [[Honeycomb]]'''

* Can be used to craft [[beehive]]s and [[honeycomb block]]s.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Bee Spawn Egg JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bee spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Bee.gif|32px]] [[Bee]]'''
* Have {{hp|10}} health.
* Live in groups near [[hive]]s and [[nest]]s.
** If a bee does not have a home nest, it wanders until it finds one.
** Can hide inside hives.
*** Maximum of 3 bees per nest.
* Are [[neutral mob]]s.
** When attacked, all bees from the same hive try to attack the original attacker.
*** The same happens when their hive or nest is {{ctrl|destroyed}}.
**** {{ctrl|Placing}} a [[campfire]] or lighting [[fire]] under the nest makes the bees passive.
*** Have an {{nbt|int|Anger}} data tag, which defaults to zero.
**** When the bee is attacked, this tag is set to around 700 ticks.
*** When they attack, they give [[Poison]] to the target for 10 seconds and then they die 50–60 seconds after attacking.
*** When in an angry state, their eyes are red.
* Affected by the [[Bane of Arthropods]] enchantment.
* Can be bred using any type of [[flower]], including wither roses.
** They follow any player holding a small flower.
*** If the player holds still, bees hover around them.
* Hover around flowers and enter a "pollinated" state after some time. When pollinated, pale white [[particle]]s come off them. The bee also has its texture changed to include dots similar in color to the pollen particles.
** Bees try to pollinate wither roses despite the fact that they are harmed by the [[Wither (status effect)|Wither]] effect they give.
** When they pollinate flowers, a small popping noise is heard.
** Return to their nest after entering the "pollinated" state. 
** A pollinated bee can accelerate the growth of [[crops]] and [[sweet berry bush]]es it passes.
** After enough bees enter a bee nest in the pollinated state, the bee nest is filled with honey.
* Try to avoid [[water]].
* Being killed by a bee sting results in new [[death message]]: "<''player''> was stung to death".

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|data}}'''
* Can now use [[command storage|{{cd|storage}}]] as a source or target, which is general purpose, key/value storage.
** Each storage is identified by a distinct [[resource location]].

== Trivia ==
* [[File:Wax Block (texture) JE1.png|30px]] [[File:Crystallized Honey.png|30px]] Unused textures for a "wax_block" and a "crystallized_honey" item could be found in the game files during development of 1.15; these were accidentally added and were removed in snapshot [[19w42a]].<ref>{{tweet|cojomax99|1183761380228452355|The crystallized honey and wax block textures will not be part of the Holiday Update. They were not meant to have ever made it into the game and will be removed soon :) Thanks for all the theories and ideas surrounding them though!|14 Oct 2019}}</ref>
