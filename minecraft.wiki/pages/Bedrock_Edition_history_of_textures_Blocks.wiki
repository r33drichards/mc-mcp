{{wip|It is advised that [[terrain.png]]'s Pocket Edition section be filled out as much as possible, and [[terrain-atlas.tga]] also be filled out to terrain.png's standard}}
This page document the history of the [[List of block textures|textures of blocks]], their additions, changes and removals. Additions and changes made to the models of blocks, as well as any new blocks which reuse prior textures, will '''not''' be documented here.

=== Block Textures ===
{{cleanup|section=1|Bedrock Edition:
* Possibly move unused pocket edition textures to the unused textures page/section?
* Reorder and organise early Pocket Edition's texture orders
* Fill in everything after alpha 1.0.5.0}}
{{more images|section=1|
* Lantern texture prior to being given an animation
* Earth-exclusive blocks
* Nether reactor core texture in 0.15.0}}
<!--- Make sure colored items are ordered: default, white, light gray, gray, black, brown, red, orange, yellow, lime, green, cyan, light blue, blue, purple, magenta, pink
Make sure wood/leaves/sapling related items are ordered: oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, mangrove, cherry, bamboo, crimson, warped
Make sure flowers are ordered: the same as Creative inventory
Make sure coral are ordered: tube, brain, bubble, fire, horn (blocks, dead blocks, coral, dead coral, fans, dead fans)
After the above take precedence, remaining items should be ordered the same as Creative inventory when possible--->
