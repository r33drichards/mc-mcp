[[File:Blocks preview.png|thumb|right|Some of the most common blocks in ''[[Minecraft]]'', clockwise from the left: stone, sand, dirt, and grass.]]

'''Blocks''' are the basic units of a structure in ''[[Minecraft]]'' that make up the game's world. Many blocks can be collected and placed anywhere, and can also be used as helpful resources.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Coral reef at night.png|thumb|right|A variety of different blocks occurring in an underwater coral reef: [[sand]] lining the ground, [[cut sandstone]] in underwater ruin structures, and various forms of coral.]]
Blocks are arranged in a [[w:Cubic honeycomb|3-dimensional grid]] of 1-cubic-meter cells, although some blocks appear to occupy a partial cell; these include [[slab]]s, [[snow]] layers, [[ladder]]s, [[vine]]s, [[stairs]], [[turtle egg]]s, and [[sea pickle]]s, among others.

Collectively, blocks and [[fluids]] make up the in-game environment, and most can be harvested and utilized in various fashions. Some blocks, such as [[dirt]] and [[sandstone]], are [[opaque]] and occupy their entire cubic meter, while others, such as [[glass]] and [[flower]]s, are [[Opacity#Types of transparent blocks|transparent]] or non-solid. [[Explosion]]s destroy some blocks more easily than they destroy others, while some are virtually immune to explosions. They can still be ''theoretically'' exploded.<!--Technically not true. Even bedrock can be destroyed with a powerful enough explosion!-->

[[Air]] is a special block that acts as a substitute for the absence of blocks. It has two variants: [[cave air]] and [[void air]].{{only|JE}}

Some blocks, such as [[sea lantern]]s and [[glowstone]], emit [[light]], the amount of which varies widely; see [[Light#Blocks|this table of light values]] for further information. Opaque blocks completely block light, while transparent blocks have no effect on light, block the light, or merely weaken it.

Almost all blocks ignore gravity, except for [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[gravel]], [[anvil]]s of all damage levels, [[dragon egg]]s, all colors of [[concrete powder]], [[scaffolding]], [[snow]] layers{{only|BE|short=1}}, [[pointed dripstone]], [[suspicious sand]], and [[suspicious gravel]]. These [[Falling Block|turn into entities]] when their support is removed.

When broken, blocks emit [[sound]]s and [[particle]]s associated with themselves, except in the following cases:
*If the block is affected by gravity and falls into an invalid space (If the block is gravity based and drops onto a torch, for example).<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|135869|Gravity-affected blocks broken when falling into an invalid space do not make a sound or produce particles|date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>
*[[Anvil]]s that are destroyed by running out of durability or falling. Only particles are missing.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|135868|Anvils broken by falling or overusage do not produce particles|date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>
*If the block can be washed away and is washed away by a flowing fluid.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|25976|Blocks broken by flowing fluids do not produce particles or make breaking sounds|date=July 15, 2013}}</ref>
*If the block can be replaced by other blocks and is replaced.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|136703|Blocks directly replaced by other blocks do not produce particles, make breaking sounds or drop items where appropiate|date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>
*If the block is one of a few blocks such as rails or redstone wire, supported by another block and its supporting block is removed.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|123350|Rails and redstone components don't break / create particles when support block is broken|date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>
*If the block is [[leaves]] and decays.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|136693|Decaying leaves do not produce block breaking particles/sounds|date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>

== Block height ==
{{main|Solid block#Height}}

Most solid blocks are 1 meter high (3.28084... feet or {{frac|1250|381}} feet), but several blocks have non-standard block heights, such as [[slab]]s.

A player can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height if the difference is at most 0.6 ({{frac|3|5}}) of a block or 1.9685... feet ({{frac|250|127}} feet).

== Textures ==
{{Main|Textures|List of block textures}}
The textures on the faces of most blocks are 16×16 pixels, which control all colors and transparencies. Exceptions include [[candle]]s, [[sculk sensor]]s, and other blocks with animations, which use texture files with multiple frames, and block entity textures which are rendered in different models. Some blocks with square textures have different textures for faces, such as [[log]]s.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]] and [[ray tracing]], the game uses multiple texture files on top of the color textures, which affects how light and reflections behave on the block. The MERS (MER with ray tracing) texture map is used to define per pixel how metallic (reflects all light), emissive (produces its own light), or rough (absorbs all light) it is, with an additional subsurface scattering (how light is scattered on the surface) applied to Vibrant Visuals only. With resource packs, other texture maps are also used, including normal and heightmaps. These change depth of the block, and can add multiple 3D effects.

Using [[resource pack]]s, the player can change the textures and resolution of blocks, including whether their texture is animated. They can also change the shapes of blocks using [[model]]s and the size of blocks to any size with equal width and height, though sizes that are a power of two tend to work better.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Block|-shield|-sword}}

== Trivia ==
*Certain blocks may interpret positions they cannot be placed in by normal means as a valid position. For example, a [[sign]] placed in midair via {{command|setblock}} remains in midair even when updated, until either it is broken, or a block is placed below it and broken.
