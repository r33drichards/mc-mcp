'''''Minecraft: Pocket Edition''''' (informally known as '''MCPE''' or '''PE''') was the former title of the [[Bedrock Edition]] of ''[[Minecraft]]'' developed by [[Mojang Studios]] for mobile devices before [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0|1.2.0]], although subsequent builds are still commonly (if erroneously) referred to as ''Pocket Edition''. ''Pocket Edition'' introduced the Bedrock Engine, which was later ported to non-mobile platforms as four other editions of ''Minecraft'': ''[[Windows 10 Edition]]'', ''[[Gear VR Edition]]'', ''[[Apple TV Edition]]'', and ''[[Fire TV Edition]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150704220210/https://mojang.com/2015/07/announcing-minecraft-windows-10-edition-beta/ Announcing: ''Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta''] - Mojang.com; July 4, 2015</ref><ref>https://oculus.com/blog/minecraft-now-available-on-oculus-for-gear-vr</ref><ref>https://minecraft.net/article/apple-tv-edition-released</ref><ref>https://amazon.com/d/B01NCJDPER</ref> When these editions received the [[Better Together Update]], the "Edition" subtitle was removed, and the official name for all of these editions became ''Minecraft''. To assist with clarification, Mojang and the community referred to these versions collectively as {{el|be}}, due to Bedrock being the name of the {{w|C++}} codebase from which they all derive.

''Pocket Edition'' was initially launched exclusively for the {{w|Xperia Play}} on Google Play<ref name="google-play-store-page"/> for US$6.99 on August 16, 2011. It was later released for other {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}} devices on October 7, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|kappische|122246496941899776}}</ref> and {{w|iOS}} on November 17, 2011.<ref>http://appleinformer.org/2011/11/minecraft-pocket-edition-for-ios-now-available-for-download</ref> On September 13, 2012, the ''Pocket Edition'' was made available for purchase on the Amazon Appstore. ''[[Pocket Edition Lite|Minecraft Pocket Edition Lite]]'', which was essentially version 0.2.1 without world save functionality and had limited inventory items, was available until October 21, 2013. The {{w|Windows Phone 8.1}} version was released on the Microsoft Store on December 10, 2014.<ref>http://windowscentral.com/minecraft-pocket-edition-comes-windows-phone</ref> The Windows Phone 8.1 version (which also ran on {{w|Windows 10 Mobile}}) was discontinued after the release of [[Pocket Edition v0.16.2 alpha|v0.16.2]] on November 18, 2016, and was later replaced by a release for Windows 10 Mobile only (which was free to owners of the previous Windows Phone 8.1 version) on February 22, 2017 starting with [[Pocket Edition 1.0.3|1.0.3]].<ref>{{Mcnet|upgrade-windows-phone-players}}</ref> After the release of [[Pocket Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]], ''Pocket Edition'' for Fire OS was no longer available for Fire TV, but the new, more expensive ''[[Fire TV Edition]]'' was free to its previous owners.

== Gameplay ==
The objective of the game remains the same as its {{els|je|lce}} counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. Like its counterparts, ''Pocket Edition'' also has [[survival]] elements present in other versions of the game such as [[brewing]], [[hunger]], and dimensions like the [[Nether]] and the [[End]]. The [[multiplayer]] mode is cross-platform compatible between all touch-screen devices capable of running Pocket Edition.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120313124931/http://www.mojang.com/2011/11/minecraft-pocket-edition-on-ios/ ''Minecraft - Pocket Edition'' on iOS!] - Mojang.com; November 18, 2011</ref>

The [[HUD]] and other elements are adapted to mobile standards of gameplay. Interactions are made via touchscreen (both the iOS and Android versions of ''Pocket Edition'' have the same gameplay<ref>{{tweet|kappische|142677729135968256}}</ref>). To comply with the disadvantages of touchscreen gameplay, several features were revised. For instance, the [[crafting]] system uses the [[MATTIS]] system and items are disposed of by long-tapping their icon on the toolbar. For better visibility on mobile screens, blocks being aimed at are highlighted rather than outlined. Unlike mobile's crafting menu, Windows 10 edition's crafting menu is similar to Java and Console crafting menu. The game was released with graphics akin to that of [[Java Edition Alpha]] (bright green grass blocks, old cobblestone texture, etc.), but as of [[Pocket Edition v0.8.0 alpha|v0.8.0]], graphics have become equivalent to the ''Java Edition'' but also including light tinting and shading affected by the [[sun]]'s position. Differences from the ''Java Edition'' include:

* Multiplayer allows for 4 ways of player connection:
** Through LAN, allowing for 5 players to be on a single world.
** Through [[Pocket Realms]]. Pocket Realms was closed in [[Pocket Edition v0.7.6 alpha|v0.7.6]] and now newly available again in Alpha [[Pocket Edition v0.15.0 alpha|v0.15.0]].
** Through a user-created external server.
** Through Xbox Live.

=== Release ===
On May 22, 2009, early in ''Minecraft's'' development, [[Notch]] indicated he had "vague plans about porting minecraft for Android in the future."<ref>{{cite|url=https://notch.tumblr.com/post/111362732|title=I set up an IRC channel for Minecraft|website=The Word of Notch|date=May 22, 2009}}</ref>

A video of an early prototype was released on Twitter, showing the game on the Xperia Play. The alpha version was later released and became no longer exclusive to the Xperia Play on October 7, 2011. The non-exclusive version was going to be released on September 29 for Android<ref>{{ytl|rCcsuPH4vJY}}</ref> but there were several severe bugs that needed to be fixed; the release was delayed until October 7.

=== Alpha ===
After the initial releases for iOS and Android, updates were released in parallel, with the same features being added for both platforms. During the Alpha stage, various aspects of gameplay were introduced into Pocket Edition including: [[crafting]], [[smelting]], more [[blocks]], [[items]], [[mobs]] and more game modes to bring it closer to the Java Edition. As the Minecraft Pocket Edition development team works closely, often blocks released on the Java Edition are released around the same time for the Pocket Edition. Certain features were also tested on Pocket Edition before their Java Edition releases, such as [[beetroot]]s and their related items, and also [[block model]]s.

=== Full Release ===

On November 11, 2016, the [[Pocket Edition 1.0.0|1.0.0]] ([[Ender Update]]) was announced. It was released on December 19, 2016.

=== Builds ===
Starting on November 22, 2013,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131210073616/https://mojang.com/2013/11/android-beta-program-for-minecraft-pe/ Android beta program for Minecraft PE] - Mojang.com; November 22, 2013</ref> [[Mojang]] began to publicly release testing versions of full updates to Android users who opt into the beta program, in order to get major feedback, especially for bug reporting. This enabled the official updates to be considerably more stable.

Versions from 0.8.0 to 0.12.1 required opting into a [https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.mojang.minecraftpe Google+ group] to receive development builds. Players would then see development updates appear as normal updates in the Play Store. On July 17, 2015, the Google+ group was removed due to the amount of spam and advertisements that the group attracted.<ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|621982409140105216|PE BETA community in G+ that was briefly available yesterday and today was real, but we only used it for "spam control testing". >>|July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|621984399349948416|The community was removed and no longer exists. We always announce beta on our Twitter accounts and sometimes on Mojang blog.|July 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|621992330313236480|We were trying to limit spam amount we get from people who sign up not to test but to advertise.|July 17, 2015}}</ref> On November 3, 2015, the PE Beta team published a [http://pocketbeta.minecraft.net dedicated blog]<ref>{{tweet|missmarzenia|661531497527164928|Please, read the FAQ bfore you ask a question.|November 3, 2015}}</ref> that was subsequently used for users to opt into the 0.13.0 beta program and to display changelogs for these development builds.

== Success ==
As of December 2013, Pocket Edition had sold 16.5 million copies, while in the same time, Java Edition had sold 13 million. These calculations came out after the 0.8.0 update.<ref>http://theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/17/mojang-minecraft-pocket-edition-apple</ref>

On December 2, 2016, [[Marsh Davies]] announced that Pocket Edition had sold over 40 million copies<ref>https://minecraft.net/article/pocket-edition-5-years-old</ref> (at the time, Java Edition had sold over 24 million).

It is also usually in the top 10 and regularly #1 in the Apple App Store's and Google Play's ''Paid Apps'' Section in the ''Top Charts''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161118230337/http://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/paid-apps/ iTunes - Browse the top paid apps on the App Store] - Apple; Archived from November 18, 2016</ref><ref>https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/topselling_paid</ref>

== Controls ==
{{main|Controls#Bedrock Edition}}

=== Mobile devices (iOS, Android & Others)===
The iOS, Android and other versions feature a D-pad at the bottom-left corner of the screen, which controls movement. When moving forward, two strafing buttons appear. The jump button is located on the bottom-right corner, and the sneak is in the center of the D-pad. Sneaking can be achieved by double tapping this button. The location of the jump button and the sneak button can be swapped, in the controls section of the options menu. Note that when moving toward an adjacent block that is one level higher than the [[player]], the player automatically jumps up the block. This can also be disabled in the controls section of the options menu. One can place blocks by tapping the screen in a desired location. Destroying blocks is similar to the Java Edition's way, but rather than clicking the mouse, the player taps and holds. Split controls can also be used, which allows the player to place and break blocks similarly to Java Edition, where a crosshair appears and allows the player to place blocks using that. To change to the camera view, the player can go to Settings > Video. There should be a dropdown button displaying the player's current view, and tapping on it opens a dropdown menu allowing the player to choose different camera views. To open the inventory screen, tap the triple dotted button on the right of the hot bar. The player can touch and hold an item in the [[hot bar]] to throw it, and if the hot bar contains a stack of items, it throws the entire stack. The player cannot divide it unless interfacing with a container (chest, furnace). The player can however switch to the Java Edition menu system via settings.

==== Xperia Play ====

<ref group=note name=flying>To fly: Quickly press jump twice in a row. To ascend, hold the up on the other side of the screen button and press up on the directional pad. To descend, hold jump and press down. ([[Creative]] only)</ref>
}}

=== Tablet features ===
All devices have an option to enable Split Touch Controls, which may be more suitable for bigger screens. There is a crosshair and dragging a finger across the screen lets the player rotate the camera. 

Other than the screen size difference allowing any number of slots in the hotbar, the tablet version of the game is the same as other versions, hence the ability to play multiplayer cross-platform with other devices.

===''Windows 10 Edition'' ===
''Windows 10 Edition'' has 3 control options:

* '''Keyboard''': Similar controls to Java Edition.

* '''Touch Screen''': Used with Windows 10 PC's touch screen. The controls are exactly like the ones in Pocket Edition.

*'''Controller''': Used with compatible controllers, with a similar button layout to [[Controls#Legacy Console Edition|Console Edition's controls]]. These controls can be customized.

Some devices below these specifications have been known to work fine either with or without custom ROM images, kernels, and {{w|overclocking}} of the CPU. However, the CPU {{w|MSM7000#MSM7x27|MSM7227}} is not supported due to its lack of the floating-point unit.<ref>{{w|MSM7000#MSM7x27|MSM7000 § MSM7x27}}</ref> The processor Tegra 2 is also not supported because the processor has no support for Neon.

== Trivia ==
* Until [[0.5.0]], there was a "J" version of Pocket Edition designed for low-end devices. Notably it used different stepping sounds from the regular version, that were later introduced in [[Java Edition]] in version [[1.4.2]].
* ''[[Minecraft: Pi Edition]]'' is derived from an early Pocket Edition development version.
* In the demo video, before the game was released, smooth lighting was available. It was taken out due to bugs being produced on a wide range of devices. As of 0.7.0, it is on by default, and since 0.8.0, it cannot be turned off.
* The terrain.png file found in filesystem of the App is nearly identical to that in the Java Edition, containing textures for items unimplemented in the ''Pocket Edition'' (e.g., [[flower]]s). However, in 0.8.0, this file was replaced with terrain-atlas.tga, a neater version of the previous file
* The barrier wall in old worlds is also cut by the height limit allowing players to go over it.
* The average placing/destroying block range is 4-6 on the Java Edition and 6-9 on iOS/Android.

==''China Edition'' ==
{{Main|China Edition}}
Shortly before the release of 1.2, the game company {{w|NetEase}} licensed ''Minecraft'' in mainland China.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160520081616/https://mojang.com/2016/05/minecraft-is-coming-to-china/ Minecraft is coming to China] - Mojang.com; May 20, 2016</ref> The original version was replaced with a separate edition based on ''Pocket Edition'' and is instead available for free, with a marketplace where players can buy maps, skins, mods and resource packs with Emeralds (an in game currency that can be bought with real money or by logging in every day).

Shortly after the release of ''Minecraft: China Edition'', an update was released on iOS devices for the original version titled [[Pocket Edition 1.1.7|1.1.7]]. This update disables the [[Marketplace|store]].
