'''Emotes''' are cosmetical items from the [[Dressing Room]] that allow players to perform animations.

== Usage ==
The [[Dressing Room]] includes a section for emotes. Some emotes are available for free, while most are obtained using [[Minecoins]], from [[Marketplace]] packs, and as [[achievement]] rewards. The player can "equip" up to 4 of their emotes at a time. When in a world, pressing {{key|B}} on a keyboard, or {{Xbutton|onedpad-left}}, {{Nsbutton|left}}/{{Nsbutton|dpad-left}}, {{Psbutton|4dpad-left}} or {{Psbutton|5dpad-left}} on a controller opens the main emote selection menu. A quick-emote selection menu also can be quickly accessed by holding aforementioned emote button and then selecting the corresponding input from the small pop-up window. When using touch controls, tapping [[File:Emote button.png|20px]] button on the top of the screen while in a world opens the emote menu. The player can then tap an emote to perform the animation. 

Whenever a player performs an emote, a message in the [[chat]] is shown for all players describing the emote, which can be disabled in the chat settings.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|projects=mcpe}}

== Trivia ==
* It actually does not matter whether the [[player]] is submerged (partially or fully) in a [[liquid]] ([[water]] or [[lava]]), [[flying]], [[Damage#Fall damage|falling]], [[levitation|levitating]], [[sneaking]], or on dry land, just as long as the player isn't riding anything, the player would still perform the emote.
* In the crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', the simple clap emote is used for Steve's clap animation when he loses a battle or if a player resigns from a battle, resulting in a "No Contest" screen.
* The "Celebrate" emote was shown at [[MINECON Live 2019]], but has not been made available.<ref>{{ytl|OZqNaEX8208|t=1h37m5s|MINECON Live 2019|September 28, 2019}}</ref>
* The Fake Death emote can be used to conceal the player inside of a wall by using the emote when one is in a corner.
