A '''portfolio''' is an [[item]] that can save [[photo]]s taken with a [[camera]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047555551-Assessment-Tools-Cameras-Portfolio-Book-Quill#portfolio|title=Assessment Tools (Cameras, Portfolio, Book & Quill)|section=Portfolio|website=edusupport.minecraft.net|author=Penny}}<!-- old ref: https://aka.ms/MEEBookAndQuill --></ref>

== Obtaining ==
Portfolios can be obtained in the [[Creative inventory]] or given through the {{cmd|give}} command.

== Usage ==
[[File:Portfolio Interface.png|thumb|400px|upright=1.5|The portfolio interface]]
Once a photo has been taken using the [[camera]], it appears in the portfolio. Once equipped, pressing the {{control|Use Item}} control brings up a two-page book of photos the [[player]] has taken, in chronological order. Captions can be added below each picture. Each picture can be deleted or saved as a [[Photo|photo item]] in the player's inventory. The "Add Photo" button allows the player to add pictures from photo items in their inventory, while the "Export Portfolio" button creates a PDF file in a specified folder containing all photos stored in the portfolio.
