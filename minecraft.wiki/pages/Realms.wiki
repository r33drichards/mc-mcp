'''Minecraft Realms''' is an official subscription-based [[server]] hosting service that allows players to create and manage their own private ''Minecraft'' servers. Hosted by [[Mojang Studios]], Realms provides a simple way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without knowledge of hosting on the internet. ''Minecraft'' Realms also provides additional features such as player-made [[Java Realms Content Creator Program|maps]] and [[Realms Stories]]. Only one player needs to own the subscription, while other players can be invited to a Realm for free. Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.<ref>{{tweet|danfrisk|311725356434460672|Quick info: Minecraft Realms isn't built for huge public servers. The sweetspot is a group of invited friends or a family server.|March 12, 2013}}</ref>

Realms internally uses [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]] on {{BE}},<ref>{{tweet|1857460825822474734}}</ref> and [[server.jar]] on {{JE}}.{{note|Settings internal to Realms can be found in [[server.properties]].}}

==Requirements==
Realms is a service that can be used only by players who meet these requirements:<ref>{{tweet|Marc_IRL|468517035153301505|Realms!|May 19, 2014}}</ref>
*The player must have purchased the full version of {{JE}} or {{BE}} and must be signed in with a [https://account.microsoft.com/account Microsoft account].
*The player must have a stable Internet connection.
*Parental consent is required for players under the age of 16 in the US and the EU, or 19 in South Korea.<ref>{{citation|url=https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408968616077|title=Set Up Microsoft Family Groups for Parental Controls in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition|website=Minecraft Help Center}}</ref>{{verify|Is this also required for joining Realms?

*If using a console, the player must also have an active subscription to either:
** Xbox Game Pass Core or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate if using an Xbox console.
** Nintendo Switch Online if using a Nintendo Switch.
** PlayStation Plus if using a PlayStation console.

==Subscriptions==
:''Manage the Realms subscriptions [https://minecraft.net/profile/realms here].''

Realms is a subscription-based service. The link above goes to the player's Minecraft account page, which offers options to extend a current subscription or buy a new one. One player can have multiple active Realms subscriptions.
[[File:Ore UI - Minecraft Realms Screen - Buy Now Button - Choose Your Plan Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The purchase screen for the two plans {{In|be}}.]]
There are two types of subscriptions in ''Bedrock Edition'': '''Realms Core''' ({{w|United States dollar|US$}}3.99 per month) and '''Realms Plus''' ({{w|United States dollar|US$}}7.99 per month).<ref name=":0">https://minecraft.net/realms</ref> The main difference is that Realms Core is limited to 2 players at a time active in a world, and Realms Plus is limited to 10 players. Realms Plus also includes a subscription to the [[Marketplace Pass]], and a one-time 30 day free trial for each account. Realms Core subscriptions can be upgraded to Realms Plus at any time without the loss of the Realms server.

Any Realms subscription in ''Bedrock Edition'' also includes a free Realms server for ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', which exists separately from the default Realm but is connected to the same subscription.

[[File:Realms Subscriptions.png|300px|thumb|The subscription screen in-game {{in|Java}}, accessed through the Configuration menu.]]
There are two types of subscriptions in ''Java Edition'' (also known as '''Java Realms'''): a reoccurring monthly charge that automatically renews the subscription every 30 days (this can be canceled at any time), or a one-time charge that comes in 30-day, 90-day, and 180-day packages and needs to be renewed manually. Both subscriptions cost US$7.99 per month.<ref name=":0" /> All players are able to have a 30-day free Realms trial, providing they have not already had a free trial on their account before.

Only the owner of a Realm needs a subscription to be able to manage the Realm. Other players can join the Realm for free if they have access granted by the owner.

==Usage==
{{See also|Tutorial:Menu screen/Java Edition#Minecraft Realms|Tutorial:Menu screen/Bedrock Edition#Realms}}
The main menu for ''Minecraft'' Realms, accessible from the [[Title Screen|title screen]] in ''Java Edition'' and the [[play screen]] in ''Bedrock Edition'' shows all Realms servers the player owns or has joined. A new Realms subscription can be purchased from this menu, and the player can join new Realms from invites or invite links.{{Only|be|short=1}} Invites sent by a Realms owner can be found in the invitations menu in the Realms screen in ''Java Edition'' and in the inbox screen in ''Bedrock Edition''. In ''Bedrock Edition'', the player can also enter an invite link provided by a Realms owner to join a Realm without an invite.

The main page of a Realm shows the Realm's name and description, as well as online players and the option to manage the Realm or leave the Realm. A Realm can be joined by pressing the "Play" button on a Realm, or by selecting the Realm through [[Quick Play]] in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''. Additionally, in ''Bedrock Edition'', the player can create a [[W:Shortcut (computing)|desktop shortcut]] which lets the player directly join the Realm. The player needs to create an internet shortcut with {{Cd|1=minecraft://connectToRealm/?realmId=}} followed by the Realm's ID (or {{Cd|1=minecraft-preview://connectToRealm/?realmId=}} for ''[[Preview]]'' Realms), found in the URL of the Realm's page on [https://www.minecraft.net/nl-nl/msaprofile/mygames minecraft.net].

=== Worlds ===
[[File:Realms Configure (Bedrock).png|thumb|The world selection screen {{In|be}}.]]
A Realms server can store up to three [[worlds]], from which one can be activated at a time. The Realms owner can select which world is activated and [[World Options#Classic UI|edit a world's settings]] (including [[add-ons]]),{{Only|be|short=1}} or manage the world files. Not all options from the regular edit world screen are available for ''Minecraft'' Realms, but this can be bypassed by uploading a local world to the Realm. A world slot on the Realm can be replaced by any local world of the Realms owner. The owner can also choose to download a world, or reset the world slot to a new default world. In ''Bedrock Edition'', most world settings can also be changed from the [[pause menu]] while playing on the Realm.

In ''Bedrock Edition'', any Realms subscription also allows access to the [[Realms Celebration Map]], which is enabled in the third world slot by default.

==== Backups ====
Java Realms automatically creates a backup every few hours when players are online. Each backup shows the time it was made and its size.

The owner of the Realm can choose to replace the world slot with the world data stored on a backup. Each backup can also be downloaded to the device as a singleplayer world.

==== Realms saves ====
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}[[File:Manage Realms Screen Menu "Saves" Tab Settings (Bedrock Preview 1.21.120.25).png|thumb|The Realms saves tab.]]
In addition to the three Realm slots, multiple world saves can be stored on Realms. Automatic saves are taken at the end of every Realms play session when the server shuts down, or every 30 minutes during a play session, and are only retained for a limited time.

Players can also manually save backups on the Realm. These saves are retained as long as the Realm exists. Automatic saves can be turned into manual saves to retain them for longer. However, the maximum storage for each Realm is limited for manual saves. Realms Plus subscriptions have 10GB of manual save storage, and Realms Core subscriptions have 5GB. 

The owner of the Realm can find the Realms saves in the general Realm settings screen. The player can choose to replace a world slot with a save, or to download the save to the device.

=== Members ===
The owner of the Realm can invite players by adding their player name to the Realm in ''Java Edition'', or by adding an Xbox friend in the "Members" tab of the Realm's settings in ''Bedrock Edition''. Players can be added as friends by entering the gamertag in the "Search for players" screen which can also be accessed from the "Members" tab. 

Individual players can be removed at any time from the Realm, and they can also be banned to prevent them from joining with an invite link. For each player, the Realm owner can set the [[permission level]] or [[player permissions]]. In ''Java Edition'', the owner can also promote players to grant them the right to change permission levels.

Members can also be managed from the pause menu in ''Bedrock Edition'' while playing on the Realm.

==== Invite links ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
The owner of the Realm can create and activate invite links for the Realm. Any player can join the Realm by entering it in the "Join a Realm" screen in-game, or by entering {{Cd|https://realms.gg/}} in the browser's search bar followed by the invite link. Invite links automatically expire in 7 days, but this can be disabled or set to a different time between 30 minutes and 7 days, with limited options. The owner can also enable or disable invite links directly.

=== Maps ===
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
[[File:Java Realms Minigame Selection.png|thumb|The UI for selecting a minigame to install on the Realm.]]
{{See also|Java Realms Content Creator Program|title1=Java Realms Content Creator Program}}
On ''[[Java Edition]]'', besides generating new worlds and uploading [[singleplayer]] worlds, Realm owners can also choose to install a premade map from a curated selection. All available maps are ensured to be compatible with the latest stable version (which a Realm must always run on), have been reviewed by Mojang and published through the [[Java Realms Content Creator Program]].

The full list of maps that have been submitted through the program, as well as whether they're currently available for install on Realms, can be found [[Java Realms Content Creator Program#List of Maps|here]].

A Realm can have three world slots that the owner can switch between at any time. An additional temporary world slot is reserved for premade maps categorized as Minigames. Unlike regular worlds, minigames do not save players' progress, and they reset whenever all players log out.

=== Realms Stories ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}{{Main|Realms Stories}}
[[File:Ore UI - Realms Stories Screen Menu "Story Feed" Tab (Bedrock).png|thumb|The main screen of Realms Stories.]]
{{IN|be}}, all members of a Realm have access to Realms Stories, an in-game social platform which allows players to communicate outside of the world. Players can post comments and screenshots, and like comments from other players. The game also creates stories known as Realm Events, which document an important event in the world, such as when a player defeats the Ender Dragon.

Players that are opted in also have access to the Timeline, a table which shows the playing activity for all members on the Realm. All players can also open each other's [[Profile screen|profile screens]] and view [[player permissions]] from the Members tab.

The Realm owner can also manage some settings related to Realms Stories, such as whether players are required to opt in to the Timeline to play on the Realm, whether Realm Events are enabled, and whether [[coordinates]] of Realm Events are shown.

Realms Stories can also be accessed from the pause menu while playing on the Realm.

=== Settings ===
Exclusive [[settings]] exist for the Realm's owner to manage the Realm, including Realm name and description, and server region. The Realm owner can also choose to close the Realms server, which makes members unable to play on the Realm.

A custom server region for the Realm can be configured through the Realm's settings menu. The owner can choose whether Realms should automatically select the server region with the lowest ping for the first player to join a session, or always select a specific server region. The selected server region is shown in the [[loading world screen]] when joining a Realm.

In ''Java Edition'', players can toggle the profanity filter in the in-game [[chat]] from the [https://minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/accountsettings account settings] on minecraft.net. In ''Bedrock Edition'', the profanity filter can be toggled from the in-game [[settings]].

On the [https://www.minecraft.net/nl-nl/msaprofile/mygames profile page] on minecraft.net, all owned Realms can be viewed and managed. Most Realm-wide settings can also be changed here, including name and description, invite links, activated world, and player permissions. Friends can be invited and members can be removed or banned.

==Limitations==
Although Realms is hosted by [[Mojang Studios]], it has some limitations. These limitations can be avoided by using standalone [[Server#Variants|server software]] or a third-party hosting website.

*In all versions and plans, the Realm has a player slot reserved for the owner only. The amount of other [[player]]s who can play simultaneously are as follows:<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms</ref>
**In ''Bedrock Edition'', Realms Core allows up to 2 other players, while Realms Plus allows up to 10.
**In ''Java Edition'', a Realm can have up to 10 other players.
*In ''Java Edition'' only:
**To invite or uninvite a player, or give or revoke operator status, the operator/owner must quit to menu and open the Realm's config menu from there.
**If a minigame is being played, all players have [[permission level]] 0 including the owner.
**When not playing a minigame, the owner's operator status cannot be revoked.{{Info needed}}
**Worlds on Realms '''cannot''' use [[Data pack#Experimental Settings|experimental settings]]. This applies to all user-uploaded worlds, as well as maps published through the [[Java Realms Content Creator Program]].
**[[Mod|Mods]] and [[Plugin|plugins]] cannot be installed.
**The [[render distance]] is always set to 12 chunks.<ref>https://x.com/CornerHardMC/status/1559305720230662144</ref>{{Verify}}
**Players get kicked after 15 minutes of inactivity. This can be bypassed with an [[Tutorial:Endless_circling_pool|Endless circling pool]].
*In ''Bedrock Edition'' only:
**The render distance is always limited to 24 chunks.
**The [[simulation distance]] is always limited to 4 chunks.
**The player can't enable [[experiments]] and world creation options including [[world seed]], [[flat world]], [[starting map]], [[bonus chest]], and [[Hardcore]]. However, ''all'' of these options are still available on Realms by uploading a local world with these options enabled to the Realm.
**The world seed can't be viewed in the [[edit world]] screen for worlds on the Realm. The only way for a player to view the seed is by downloading the world.
*Realms must always use the latest stable or ''[[Preview]]'' version of the game,<ref>{{bug|MC-121287||Minecraft Realms button does absolutely nothing}}</ref> except when the latest server version is backward-compatible with a client version.
*Servers reset at midnight.{{more info needed|What timezone?}}{{Verify|edition=bedrock}}
*Users under the age of 16 need parental consent to play on Realms.
**This is due to the [http://minecraft.net/privacy/gdpr/ General Data Protection Regulation].
**To set up parental consent on an account, visit [http://minecraft.net/update-account minecraft.net/update-account].
