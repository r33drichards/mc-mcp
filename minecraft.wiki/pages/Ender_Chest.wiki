An '''ender chest''' is a type of [[chest]] whose contents are exclusive to each [[player]], and they can be placed and accessed from anywhere in any dimension.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break ender chest is [[pickaxe]].

Ender chest drops 8 [[obsidian]] blocks when it's destroyed using a tool without [[Silk Touch]].<br>
Ender chest drops itself when it's destroyed using a tool with Silk Touch.

=== Natural generation ===
Ender chests naturally generate alongside a [[chest]] in certain [[End city]] treasure rooms.

== Usage ==
[[File:Ender Chest GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|GUI of the ender chest.]]

Ender chests can be opened by pressing the {{control|use}} control. If a solid block is placed above an ender chest, it cannot be opened.

Ender chests can be used like normal [[chest]]s, except all ender chests in the world are interconnected, including in different dimensions. The ender chest's inventory is also separate for each player; consequently, items stored in an ender chest cannot be seen or taken by other players. Items stored inside of an ender chest remain even if the player dies. If an ender chest is destroyed, the items inside it are not dropped and can be retrieved again by accessing or placing another ender chest. Because of this player-specific property, ender chests are useful on [[multiplayer]] servers to secure valuable items.

Donkeys, mules, and llamas cannot be equipped with ender chests; they support only normal chests.

Ender chests contain 27 slots for storage and can be placed next to other ender chests without joining; they cannot be combined into double chests. It is possible to greatly increase the space of an ender chest by pairing it with [[shulker box]]es (i.e. filling the shulker boxes with desired items, then placing them inside the ender chest). Placing 27 shulker boxes in the ender chest increases the storage space to 729 slots.

Ender chests do not interact with [[hopper]]s, [[dropper]]s, or [[comparator]]s.

Despite being made of [[obsidian]], an ender chest is not immune to destruction by the [[ender dragon]].<ref>{{bug|MC-177521||Enchanting tables and ender chests are not in the #dragon_immune tag despite being made of obsidian|WAI}}</ref>

=== Light source ===
Ender chests emit a [[light level]] of 7.

=== Note blocks ===
Ender chests can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s become hostile toward players who open or break an ender chest.<ref>{{bug|MC-172239||Piglins get mad if you open an ender chest near them|WAI}}</ref>

=== Piston interactivity ===
Ender chest cannot be pushed by the [[piston]], and cannot be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].

=== Block data ===
An ender chest has a block entity associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

{{el|java}}:
{{see also|Block entity format}}
<section begin="block data"/><div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} Block entity data
** {{nbt inherit/blockentity}}
</div><section end="block data"/>

{{el|bedrock}}:
: See [[Bedrock Edition level format/Block entity format]].

=== Inventory ===
The contents of an ender chest are not stored in the block, but in the player-NBT under the tag {{code|EnderItems}}{{only|java}}/{{code|EnderChestInventory}}{{only|bedrock}}. Thus ender chests can be viewed as "portals" to a player's 27 additional slots of secure and exclusive inventory, which are not lost on death.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*Because an ender chest's particles exist only in a 1 block radius around the chest, the particles from a chest placed next to a wall are not seen on the other side.
*Unlike chests, changes to an ender chest's name are not reflected in its inventory GUI.<ref>{{bug|MC-7559}}</ref>
*Ender chests that have their name changed will lose the name when mined with a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe.
*Ender chests render as a full block when in the inventory, but not when held or placed.{{only|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-7990}}</ref>
*Ender chests cannot be locked by NBT tags.
*The texture of ender chests does not change during [[Easter eggs#Christmas|Christmas]] in contrast to [[trapped chest]]s and normal [[chest]]s.{{only|java}}
*Mining an ender chest with a wooden pickaxe takes the longest time in the game (16.9 seconds) to mine a block with the correct tool, without the effect of [[Mining Fatigue]] and other mining speed reduction events.
*{{IN|Java}}, an ender chest produces obsidian particles when breaking and walking or falling on it, while {{in|Bedrock}}, an ender chest produces particles of the block itself.<ref>{{bug|MC-2614||All kinds of chests produce wrong particles when ran on/punched|WAI}}</ref>
