== Obtaining ==
A photo in a [[portfolio]] can be saved as a photo item by selecting the "Save to Inventory" button underneath it.

== Usage ==
Photos display an image when held in the hand or when placed in an [[item frame]], similarly to [[map]]s. Photos can have captions added to them by renaming them in an [[anvil]] or by adding a caption while they are in a portfolio. Photos can be added to [[book and quill]]s and portfolios by selecting the "Add Photo" button in the book and quill or portfolio.
