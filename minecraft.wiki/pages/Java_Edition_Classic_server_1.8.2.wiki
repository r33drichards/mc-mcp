'''1.8.2''' is a server version of [[Java Edition Classic]] released on June 20, 2009, at 21:09 UTC.<ref name="blog">{{tumblr|Notch|127176580|New minecraft-server.zip, new client|June 20, 2009}} – This blog post mentions that it fixed players being able to build using unbreakable blocks, which is also mentioned in the [[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P4:09:25 <Notch> new minecraft-server.zip that doesn't allow that block''" (21:09:25 UTC).</ref>
It is compatible with all versions between [[0.0.20a_01]] and [[0.0.23a_01]]. Versions [[Java Edition Classic 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST|0.24]] through [[Java Edition Classic 0.27 SURVIVAL TEST|0.27]] can connect, but they do not function due to the lack of survival mode support on the server at this time, as well as the addition of new blocks.
