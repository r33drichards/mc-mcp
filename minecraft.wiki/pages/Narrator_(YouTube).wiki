}}'''Narrator''' is a character in the official ''Minecraft'' [[YouTube]] channel voiced by {{wikipedia|Matthew Holness}}.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rillaskey_the-final-secrets-of-minecraft-activity-6957274717925867520-J2yV|title=Season Finale of The Secrets of Minecraft! Thank you to Adele Major and Tom Stone for the best recurring gig EVER and to Matt Holness for being the butt of my jokes. Look out for the meta moment in this (last ever?) episode...|author=[[Rill Askey]]|website=LinkedIn|date=July 25, 2022}}</ref> He narrates several series of videos, including a long running series of farcical edutainment videos with [[M.A.R.I.L.L.A.]], and independent documentaries where he serves as comic relief.

== Appearance ==
Narrator uses a skin made in the [[Character Creator]]. Due to the changes made to many of the default pieces, it is no longer possible to properly recreate a show-accurate Narrator, but all the pieces are still available.

His appearance received a slight update for the animated sections of the second ''[[How We Make Minecraft]]'' series, with the hair and skin textures differing from the Character Creator parts. Everything else remained the same, and the gameplay sections still feature Narrator's original skin to this day.

== Personality ==
Narrator is calm, sarcastic, false factual, and somewhat egotistical. Throughout videos he is frequently the butt of the joke, often being called lame or annoying by MARILLA, or immediately proven wrong of any random belief he has in ''[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHdY_46KnYsse4Kuhjz2gLjHui9wp7nG The Story of Mobs]''.

== Trivia ==
* The description card on ''Minecraft''<nowiki/>'s YouTube channel has him as "Untelligent",<sup>{{Sic}}</sup> "Self-proclaimed ''Minecraft'' expert", etc. This changes each episode.
* Narrator allegedly married [[Mobbo]], though he doesn't remember it.<ref>{{ytl|zj7oviDVEh4|Ending Minecraft: How We Make Minecraft Episode 9 @ 6:56|Minecraft|Apr 30, 2021|t=416s}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|Z4haZTbU9ZA|The Secrets of Minecraft's Deep Dark @ 2:12|Minecraft|June 24, 2022|t=132s}}</ref>
* He claims to have been born with the first name of "[[Villager|Testificates]]," because his parents didn't like him.{{Cn}} If Narrator is his full name, (which it has been alluded to) that would put his full name as "Testificates Narrator."
** This is contradicted in a [[The Untold Mystery of Minecraft|later video]], where he suspects his name is "ARGHH-HOT-HOT-HOT-LAND."<ref name=":0">{{YouTube link|NTcco6ympRk|THE UNTOLD MYSTERY OF MINECRAFT|Minecraft|August 31, 2025}}</ref>
* He believes that "[[Minecraft Antiquated Robot Inadequate Loves Lying Audaciously|MARILLA]] was created a few thousand years before rocks were invented."<ref>{{ytl|Z4haZTbU9ZA|The Secrets of Minecraft's Deep Dark @ 0:54|Minecraft|June 24, 2022|t=67s}}</ref>
* He supposedly met his end at the hands of the [[Warden]] by the orders of Mobbo.<ref>{{ytl|Z4haZTbU9ZA|The Secrets of Minecraft's Deep Dark @ 5:14|Minecraft|June 24, 2022|t=67s}}</ref> How he recovered is never addressed.
* Narrator apparently built him and Jonathan's house, but when Jonathan got it in the divorce, it was actually just a decoy.{{Cn}}
*He claims to have been almost cast in ''{{w|Avengers: Endgame}}'', playing a character M.A.R.I.L.L.A. refers to as “Cowardly British Man.”<ref>{{Mcnet|new-show-alert--the-secrets-minecraft|New show alert: The Secrets of Minecraft|July 26, 2021|[[Tom Stone]]}}</ref>
**He also claims to have been offered the lead role in ''{{w|Iron Man 2}}'', which he didn't take because of the [[Minecraft]] voiceover opportunity.{{Cn}}
*Narrator is a fan of "late 90s gangster rap," so much that it's apparently a sore spot for his neighbors.<ref>{{YouTube link|PiGKxxvCkUw|The Scariest Cow Ever Created ┃The Story Of The Warden|Minecraft|March 30, 2024}}</ref>
*Narrator's house lacks a roof, for reasons he's not even aware of.<ref name=":0" />
