'''Glass''' is a transparent [[solid block]] that can be [[dye]]d into [[stained glass]], or crafted into [[tinted glass]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Glass drops itself only if it is broken with a [[tool]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. Otherwise, it drops nothing.

Glass does not have an assigned tool; it is mined at the same speed regardless of what tool is used.<ref>{{bug|MC-179316||Glass blocks do not have an assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Glass|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
A secret room containing glass can be found inside [[woodland mansion]]s.
Glass is also generated in [[ancient cities]].

=== Smelting ===
{{Smelting
|Sand; Red Sand
|Glass
|0,1
}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{IN|je}}, glass blocks adjacent to other glass blocks are invisible when viewed through glass that is identical in color.

Mobs cannot spawn on glass blocks.

Glass blocks cannot be seen through by mobs, as they treat them as completely opaque. Mobs may look at players through glass, but this is purely visual.

[[Redstone dust]] and components can be placed on glass, but cannot power glass. Glass can't cut vertical redstone. Vertical redstone can be placed on glass. {{IN|java}}, it transmits redstone signals up, not down. Otherwise, glass in redstone circuits is functionally the same as a top [[slab]].

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Note blocks ===
Glass can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "hat" sound.
