A '''spider''' is a wall-climbing [[neutral]] [[arthropod]] that attacks [[player]]s on sight in dark areas by jumping and biting them.

== Spawning ==
Spiders can spawn in the [[Overworld]] at a [[light level]] of 0 within a 3×1×3 space centered on an opaque block. {{IN|java}}, the block ''above'' the spawning space cannot be a full solid block, including transparent ones such as leaves or [[glass]], but non-full blocks, such as [[soul sand]] or [[slab]]s, are allowed.<ref>{{bug|MC-188079}}</ref> Spiders do not spawn in [[mushroom fields]] and [[deep dark]] biomes. {{IN|Bedrock}}, spiders also do not spawn in [[river]]s, [[frozen river]]s, and [[snowy plains]] and do not spawn in groups.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Monster spawners ===
Spiders spawn from [[monster spawner]]s found in [[Monster Room|monster rooms]] (25% chance) as well as in secret rooms surrounded by [[cobweb]]s in [[woodland mansion]]s.

=== Trial spawners ===
Spiders have a {{frac|1|3}} chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].

=== Status effects ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
Spiders occasionally spawn with [[status effect]]s in [[Hard]] difficulty. For each [[Mob spawning#Pack spawning|pack spawn]], there is a (10&times;[[Difficulty#Clamped regional difficulty|clamped regional difficulty]])% chance of the game applying a status effect. This does not apply to [[cave spider]]s. These spiders can spawn with one of the following effects:
* {{EffectLink|Speed}} (40% chance)
* {{EffectLink|Strength}} (20% chance)
* {{EffectLink|Regeneration}} (20% chance)
* {{EffectLink|Invisibility}} (20% chance)

The effect is then applied to all entities within the pack, lasting forever. If the [[Invisibility]] status effect is applied to a spider, its eyes remain visible.

=== Spider jockeys ===
{{Main|Spider Jockey}}
There is a 1% chance for a spider to spawn with a [[skeleton]] riding it, forming a [[spider jockey]]. {{IN|be}}, the skeleton has an 80% chance to be replaced by a [[stray]], [[bogged]], [[parched]], or [[wither skeleton]] in the biomes where they spawn. {{IN|je}}, a spider jockey can also be spawned by the command {{Cmd|summon spider ~ ~ ~ {Passengers:[{id:skeleton}]<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}.

The skeleton controls how both mobs move. The spider can still climb walls, but the skeleton suffocates if the spider runs into a ceiling. The skeleton and the spider cannot damage each other. If they come into contact with water, they are separated.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=String|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Spider Eye|edition=java|notes=player|quantity=-1-1|lootingquantity=0-1}}

}}
{{xp|5}} [[experience]] orbs are dropped by a spider when it is killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
A spider stays hostile toward the player or an [[iron golem]] as long as the [[light]] level immediately around the spider is 11 or less; otherwise, it does not attack unless attacked first. If a spider chases its target into an area where the light level immediately around the spider is above 11, it returns to a neutral state. However, spiders pursue targets regardless of the light level in retaliation to an attack. Spiders don't instantly become hostile to the player in low-light levels, if the player stays in their range for too long, they become hostile to the player.{{only|BE}}

Despite being associated to [[iron golem]]s, [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s are ignored by spiders, regardless of light level. However, a spider can retaliate if a [[firework rocket]] set by a villager hits it.

Hostile spiders see up to 16 blocks, and pounce at close range.

Spiders can climb up over solid blocks that are not [[magma block]]s{{only|BE}}, but do not climb on underside surfaces. A spider pursuing a player can detect a player through blocks. If a spider cannot find an ideal path to the player due to a wall barring the way, it approaches as close as possible to the player's position and proceeds to climb the wall vertically until it gets to the top, even if it loses its aggression toward the player. When a spider loses its aggression, it continues moving forward blindly for 2 seconds; this behavior causes the spider to climb up any walls in its path.

Spiders flee from [[armadillo]]s that are not in a rolled-up state.

If a spider tries to go through the [[world border]], it starts climbing the world border instead.{{only|java|short=1}}

Spider can also climb on full [[boat]]s, full [[boats with chests]] and [[shulker]]s.

Even though normal spiders do not inflict the Poison [[status effect]], they are immune to it. They are also immune to the slowing applied to most mobs when walking through [[cobweb]]s.

Spiders flip onto their backs when they die, unlike most other mobs, which fall to one side.

The [[Bane of Arthropods]] enchantment inflicts [[Slowness]] IV and deals more damage to spiders.

Unlike other neutral mobs, spiders don't count towards the {{cd|AngryAt}} tag.<ref>{{Bug|MC-256289||AngryAt tag is not used by certain neutral mobs, causing them to forget their target upon reloading game}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-195278||If the "universalAnger" is set to true, certain neutral mobs don't fight back when you attack them}}</ref><ref>{{Bug|MC-187857||New neutral mob behaviour improvements were not implemented for llamas, dolphins, and spiders in the daylight}}</ref>

The regular texture of spiders makes the red eyes appear bright in contrast to the dark body, but with [[Vibrant Visuals]], the eyes are actually emissive, making them easily distinguishable in dark areas where they spawn.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Spider.png|thumb|width=165x165|A spider ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride a spider that was not spawned as a spider jockey, to form a [[jockey]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Spiders are able to climb walls because they are programmed by [[Jens Bergensten]] to treat the sides of blocks as [[ladder]]s.<ref>{{ytl|xdoH3kzg938|(Official) Minecraft: The Story of Mojang (Pt. 2/2) - Proof of Concept for Feature-Length|t=2m49s}}</ref>
* In normal conditions, spiders actually float above the ground, but this is often not noticeable due to the difference between the player's height and a spider's height.
* When a spider wanders inside an enclosed space, it often climbs up a wall until reaching the ceiling, after which it becomes stuck, unable to exit the climbing state even if it is attacked or becomes hostile to the player.<ref>{{bug|MC-154160|||WAI}}</ref>
* Spider sounds were created by distorting garden hose sounds.<ref>[https://www.20k.org/episodes/minecraft <nowiki>[sfx: Minecraft spider] Daniel: That’s a water hose. I took a water hose and I just put it in a synthesizer and pitched it around. [sfx: Minecraft spider]</nowiki>]</ref>
* Despite being animals in real life, spiders are considered monsters.
