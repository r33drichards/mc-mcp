'''Coral jewelry''' is a type of novelty item in the ''[[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles]]'' series, created using authentic coral, which became a brief fad at [[Woodsword Middle School]].

Coral jewelry can come in many forms, from necklaces, rings, and headbands.

== Properties ==
{{Expand section}}
The jewelry is crafted using real corals, meaning that they were alive and would slowly die, losing their color in the process.

== History ==
During one of her experiments, [[Doc Culpepper]] acquired various species of coral and placed them in specially designed aquariums in her basement. Her plan was to regrow many different species to combat {{Wikipedia|Environmental issues with coral reefs|climate change}}, and helps teach her class about the project. After arriving late to class, [[Harper Houston]] and [[Theo Grayson]] are paired together for the assignment. On Monday they gained results, their coral growing at an unexpected rate, and cut it into several pieces to help it grow faster. After an awkward conversation, Harper leaves to feed [[Baron Sweetcheeks]]. During this time, Theo gets the idea to use one of the newly grown corals for jewelry and takes it without telling.

He begins selling the corals, giving it to [[Ricky]] during math class. It's not long before this is caught by [[Po Chen]], who realizes it's from the lab during a basketball game. He tries to get information on where he got it from, but unwittingly draws his teammates to it. Harper is distraught when she finds out about the development, and suspects it might have been made by Theo. After leaving to confront him, she discovers it's become a trend within the school, wearing coral in various forms. Theo is quick to admit to his choice, thinking he could raise awareness by sacrificing a few, but realizes his mistake.

Later, Harper and her friends elect to solve the problem, using colored plastic to create fake coral to replace the jewelry. To assist with the initiative, Doc reached out to a coral research center, who agree to supply lab-grown coral from the school.
