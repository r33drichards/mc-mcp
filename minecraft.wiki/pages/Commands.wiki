'''Commands''' (also known as '''console commands''' or '''slash commands''') are a mechanic that execute specific actions when entered as text or triggered by blocks or certain [[entities]].

== Usage ==
In the client, commands are entered via the [[chat]] window, which is displayed by pressing the {{key|T}} / [[File:Chat button.png|25px]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} / {{Xbutton|onedpad-right}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}} or {{key|/}} key. Using the {{key|/}} key also enters the forward-slash that commands require as a prefix, so it is a useful shortcut. The {{key|Up}} / {{Xbutton|onedpad-up}} and {{key|Down}} / {{Xbutton|onedpad-down}} keys can be used to view previously entered text, including all previously executed commands.

When the cursor is at a location corresponding to some types of argument (such as an entity ID), a list of applicable values appears above the text box. If the argument already contains characters, the list displays only those values containing the typed text. Pressing {{key|Tab}} while entering commands cycles through possible commands or arguments, and can be used to auto-enter them.

Commands may also be entered in a multiplayer [[server]]'s console but are ''not'' preceded by a {{key|/}} when entered this way. A server owner running commands in this way is often referred to as "ghosting".

Commands in [[command block]]s ''can'' be preceded by a slash, but it is not required. 

Commands can be executed in the following ways:
* Entered by a player in the chat screen.
* Executed by a [[command block]] or a [[minecart with command block]].
* In a dedicated [[server]], entered in the console.
* In [[function]]s, in a [[data pack]]{{only|java|short=1}} or [[behavior pack]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
* Clicking a [[text component]] that has "run_command" action.{{only|java|short=1}}
* Requested by a WebSocket server connected to a client.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* Clicking a dialog's [[Dialog#Action format|action button]].{{only|java|short=1}}
* By an [[NPC]] dialogue.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* In scripts, in a [[behavior pack]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
* In animation controllers, in a [[behavior pack]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
* In a block event response, in a [[behavior pack]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
* In an entity event response, in a [[behavior pack]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.
{{INUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}}, commands can be executed through specified [[hotkeys]] on keyboard & mouse controls, known as '''command macros'''. Command macros can be enabled in the "Creator" [[settings]], and the keybinds with commands can be customized below all other keybinds in the settings. For up to 10 macros, a command can be entered in a text input, which can be quickly executed in-game by pressing {{Keys|Alt+''Key''}}. Command macros can be preceded by a slash, but it is not required. This feature is not to be confused with ''Java Edition''<nowiki/>'s function macros, where functions may reference additional parameters and use them in ''macro lines'' (see {{slink|Function (Java Edition)|Macros}}).

: The angle bracket decorator ({{code|<entry>}}) is usually not used on a {{code|plain text}}. A required plain text does not need any decorator.
: For example, both {{code|set}} and {{code|<set>}} represent a required plain text, but the latter one is usually not used. {{code|<size: int>}} is a required argument.

In both {{el|java}} and {{el|bedrock}}, square bracket decorator ({{code|[entry]}}) mean that an entry is optional. Entries decorated with square brackets can only be at the end of a command. Multiple entries decorated with square brackets are allowed at the end of a command, for example, {{code|a [b] [c]}} at the end of a command indicates that only {{code|a}}, {{code|a b}}, and {{code|a b c}} are valid.

=== Restrictions ===
Most commands require the executor to have a high enough [[permission level]]. That means most commands are only available in the singleplayer world if cheats are enabled, and are only available in multiplayer servers if the player is an operator. See [[permission level]] for details.

Some commands have restrictions on who can use the command or in what context.
*''None'': The command has no restriction.
* ''Cheats only''{{only|bedrock|short=1}}: Applicable only to {{el|be}}. When executed '''by the server, or a script''', the command is available no matter whether cheats are enabled. (Commands from the console, a [[Commands/schedule|scheduled function]] or a [[Function (Bedrock Edition)#tick.json|ticking function]] are executed by the server.) When executed '''in other ways''', the command is available only if cheats are enabled. When cheats are disabled, these commands can't be used unless executed by a server or a script, even if the executor has a high [[permission level]].
** {{IN|java}}, whether cheats are enabled only affects the permission level of a player. If an executor has a high enough permission level, it can use corresponding commands regardless of whether cheats are allowed.
* ''Dedicated server only'': The command is available only on dedicated servers.
* ''No dedicated server'': The command is not available on dedicated servers.

==== Cheats ====
Cheats can be enabled when [[Create New World|creating a new world]] by Allow Commands{{only|je}} / Cheats{{only|be}} options.

{{IN|java}}, the "Allow Commands" option when creating a new world only affects the player in a singleplayer world or the owner of a LAN world. The "Allow Commands" option when opening a LAN world affects all players in the LAN world.

{{IN|java}}, in singleplayer worlds where cheats were not enabled at creation, they can be enabled on a temporary basis by opening the current game session to LAN play ( {{key|Esc}} → "Open to LAN", then "Allow Cheats" button and "Start LAN World"). The player does not actually need to be on a LAN or have others join. This is not permanent but allows the use of commands until the player quits the world, and changes the player makes via commands (items spawned, etc.) are saved with the world. The player can do this each time the player starts playing the world again. Note that this disables game pausing for the duration, so while open to LAN, the player should get somewhere safe or reload their world before using the Game Menu. The player can disable the LAN world by reloading the world. To permanently enable cheats, the [[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]] file has to be edited. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, cheats can be toggled at any time in the "Cheats" tab of the settings menu. Enabling cheats in a world permanently prevents players from unlocking [[achievement]]s in that world, even if cheats are later turned off. In [[Bedrock Dedicated Server]], {{cmd|changesetting}} command can be used to toggle cheats.

=== Argument types ===
{{main|Argument types}}
There are different argument types for arguments in commands. [[Coordinates]], [[target selector]], [[SNBT]], [[text component]], and so on are commonly used formats in arguments.

=== Parsing and execution ===
{{see also|Brigadier}}

The command performing on the server side is divided into two stages: '''command parsing''' and '''command execution'''. During the command parsing stage, the game identifies the string as a command and checks whether the command is complete and whether arguments are specified correctly. During the command execution stage, the command fulfills its purpose.

When typing a command in the chat, or [[command block]], the command is also be parsed '''in the client side''' first to provide autocompletion and help the player detect typing mistakes.
: When typing an argument into the chat, it's noticeable if an argument cannot be parsed in the client side. However, being able to be parsed in the client side does '''not''' guarantee that this argument can be parsed in the server side.
::{{IN|java}}, if an argument can't be parsed by the client, the argument is marked in red, and a syntax error message is displayed above the chat bar.
::{{IN|bedrock}}, when typing in the chat, if an argument can be parsed in the client side, the next argument in syntax hint turns to white from gray. If all arguments (including optional arguments) are entered and parseable in the client side, the whole syntax hint turns to gray from white. 
:{{IN|java}}, typing a command in [[command block]] also behaves as above
:{{IN|bedrock}}, when typing a command in [[command block]], autocompletion is provided without syntax hint.

{{IN|bedrock}}, when entering into a command block, the command is parsed on the server side once the command block screen is closed. If the command is unparseable in the server side, a syntax error message is outputted into its output box.

When attempting to execute an unparseable command, an error message is displayed.
:{{IN|java}}, the message has a ''<code><--[HERE]</code>'' at its end.
:{{IN|bedrock}}, the message is <code>Unknown command</code> or <code>Syntax error: unexpected ... at ...</code>.

Commands in [[functions]] are all parsed when loading the function. If any command in a function file is unparseable, the function cannot be loaded by the game. {{IN|java}}, macro lines are parsed when attempting to run the function, see also {{slink|Function (Java Edition)|Macros}} and {{slink|Function (Java Edition)|Loading and parsing}}.

{{IN|be}}, if a command in a script is unparseable, an error is thrown when trying to execute the command.

==== Output ====
After trying to execute a command, it may yield '''output values''', including '''success count''' and '''stored values'''{{only|je}}.

Success count is the value a command passes to the command block executing it. A command block can power a [[redstone comparator]] facing away from it (may be separated by a block) with signal strength being the success count. The signal strength reflects the success count of the last command executed. Even after the command block is deactivated, the success count is retained until the command is executed again. {{IN|be}}, the success count is also returned to the script executing the command. {{IN|java}}, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks have no success count. {{IN|bedrock}}, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks or scripts still have a success count, but it cannot be obtained. {{IN|je}}, success count is always 0 or 1, except the {{cmd|execute}} command. {{IN|be}}, success count is an integer between 0 to 2,147,483,647 (both inclusive) related to the command (e.g., the number of players affected by the command, the number of blocks that were altered, etc.)

Stored values{{only|je|short=1}} include {{cd|success}} value and {{cd|result}} value, which are the values passed by other commands to the {{cmd|execute}} command, when a command is executed by a {{cmd|execute}} command. These two values can be stored to a specified location by the {{cd|store}} subcommand in the {{cmd|execute}} command. The {{cd|success}} value is always 0 or 1. The {{cd|result}} value is an integer (rounded down if not). All commands may yield these two stored values after execution, with only two exceptions: {{cmd|execute}} command itself does not yield these two stored values; {{cmd|function}} command may not yield these two stored values in certain situation.

==== Result ====
After trying to execute a command, it has a certain '''result'''. Possible results include "Unparseable", "Failed", "Successful", "Void"{{only|java|short=1}}, "Terminated"{{only|java|short=1}}, and "Error"{{only|java|short=1}}.

;Unparseable
:If the entered command is unable to be parsed in the server side, it is unparseable.

;Error{{only|java|short=1}}
:If an error occurs with a command, it means that there's a noticeable bug on the command. It may result in unintended side effects, and it jumps out the {{cmd|execute}} command halfway through, causing some branches to not be executed.
:Technically, it means that an exception other than <samp><code>brigadier.exceptions.CommandSyntaxException</code></samp> is thrown during execution.

;Void{{only|java|short=1}}
:Exclusive to {{cmd|function}} command. If it is void, the command has no {{code|result}} or {{code|success}} value to be stored by {{cmd|execute store}}.

;Terminated{{only|java|short=1}}
:Exclusive to {{cmd|execute}} command. When running a {{cmd|execute}} command, if the number of execution branches becomes 0, the command terminates, ending before the last sub-command is executed.
:For example: {{cmd|execute as @s run ...}} in a command block. The command block is not an entity, so it cannot be selected by a [[target selector]]. As a result, the command is terminated at {{cd|as @s}}.

;Failed and Successful
:If a command is not unparseable, erroring, void, nor terminated, it may be failed or successful.
:If the success count is 0, the command is failed. Otherwise, the command is successful.
::{{IN|java}}, commands that cannot be executed in command blocks have no success count. It is failed when {{cmd|execute store success ... run ...}} stores 0, and successful when {{cmd|execute store success ... run ...}} stores 1.
::{{IN|bedrock}}, if the command cannot be executed in command blocks or scripts, it still has a success count, but it cannot be obtained.
:Note that when we say that a command is failed or successful, it must not be unparseable, error, void, or terminated. Though when being unparseable, error, void or terminated, the success count is 0, it is not considered as being failed nor successful.
:Note that not all "successful" commands actually do something, and not all "failed" commands fail to do something useful.

=== Hidden commands ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|education|section=1}}
These commands are unavailable in general cases. Most of them can be accessed with a Websocket Server, NPC, or the Scripting API. Note: You can easily check if a command is still in the game by typing {{code|/help <nameOfCommand>}} into a server console, or the ingame chat. If you do so, and it says syntax error, then the command does not exist. If it either gives help on the command or says unknown command, then it is still in the game - for example, the command {{code|/help gettopsolidblock}} will return {{code|Unknown command: gettopsolidblock. Please check that the command exists and that you have permission to use it.}}, while the command {{code|/help something}} will return {{code|Syntax error: Unexpected "something" at "/help >>something<<"}}.
