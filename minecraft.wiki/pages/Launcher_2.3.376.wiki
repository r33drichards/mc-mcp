'''2.3.376''' is an update to the [[Minecraft Launcher|launcher]] released on August 19, 2022.

This update especially includes the re-addition of Korean language back to the launcher, as it was deleted from the launcher three weeks prior to this update due to the low approval percentage in [[Crowdin]].

Additionally, this update also introduced new appearances for the default Steve & Alex skins.<ref>https://twitter.com/JasperBoerstra/status/1561129697857110018</ref>
