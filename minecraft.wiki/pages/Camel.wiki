A '''camel''' is a large [[passive mob]] found in [[desert]]s. They can be [[saddle]]d and ridden by up to two [[player]]s at once. When standing, it is tall enough that its riders cannot be reached by most melee-attacking [[mob]]s on the ground.

== Spawning ==
One camel [[Mob spawning|spawns]] in the center of each [[desert village]] during [[Seed (world generation)|world generation]]. They can also spawn uncommonly in [[desert]]s in any light level{{Only|java}} or a light level of 7 and below{{Only|bedrock}}.

{{Mob spawn table|Camel}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs drop when camels are killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}. A saddle is dropped if the camel was already equipped with one. Killing a baby camel yields neither items nor experience.

=== Breeding ===
Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} is dropped.

== Behavior ==
A camel wanders aimlessly, avoiding hazards and obstacles, and occasionally sits for two to seven seconds before standing up again. {{IN|be}}, camels get up immediately once the player rides them with a [[saddle]] while sitting; {{in|je}}, they get up once the player moves {{ctrl|forwards}}. Camels immediately flee after being harmed, even when sitting. A sitting camel cannot be pushed by players or mobs.<ref>{{bug|MC-256538|||WAI}}</ref> Sitting camels do not stand up if there are solid blocks above them, as doing so would inflict [[suffocation]] damage.

[[File:camel village.png|thumb|A camel sitting in a desert village.]]

Camels can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can safely fall 3 blocks. Camels also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}). If an entity is riding a camel, they receive the same fall damage as the camel.

Camels are healed by {{Health|2}} health points each time they are fed a cactus. Camels also heal slowly on their own over time.

Even though camels are bred with cacti, touching a cactus block still harms them like any other mob. As with other mobs, camels do not avoid cacti when they pathfind.

Camels have the unique ability to step up 1.5 blocks, allowing them to surmount [[fence]]s and [[wall]]s with ease. This is in contrast to [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[mule]]s, which can't automatically step up more than one block without jumping.

Camels have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}

Camels are naturally tame, and can always be ridden by players. Up to two players can ride one camel. While riding, the player in the back seat cannot hurt the player driving or the camel itself.

Camels have one slot in their inventory for equipping a [[saddle]]. A saddle can be placed on a camel by holding it and then {{control|using}} it on the camel, or by accessing its inventory. A camel's inventory can be accessed by mounting the camel and using {{control|inventory}} control, or by {{control|sneaking}} and then {{control|using}} or pressing the "open inventory" button{{only|bedrock}} on the camel.

Once a camel is saddled, the player can control it with standard directional controls, {{control|jump}}, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control. A second player can then ride as a passenger. If the controlling passenger disembarks, then second passenger then takes control of the camel.

[[File:Husks can't reach.png|thumb|Several [[husk]]s trying to attack [[Efe]] riding a camel.]]

Camels are less maneuverable than other mounts, with their turning and strafing speed being slower. They gradually gain speed while moving in a straight line, up to a walking speed of 3.885 blocks/s, and can also manually [[sprint]] at a speed of 8.203 blocks/s by double tapping {{control|forward}} or by holding the {{control|sprint}} control while moving forward.

{{anchor|Dashing|Dash}}Saddled camels also have the ability of "dashing". When the player rides them, the experience bar on [[HUD]] is replaced by a dash charging bar, similar to the jump charging bar for horses. Dashing is done using the jump control, and holding the control charges for a longer dashing. Camels can dash every 2.75 seconds. When dashing, the camel launches up to 12 blocks forward and one block upward. For a short time after dashing, the camel cannot sprint. 

Camels are tall enough that most melee hostile mobs such as [[zombie]]s, [[vindicator]]s, [[hoglin]]s, [[silverfish]], [[endermite]]s and [[golden sword]]-wielding [[piglin]]s cannot reach mounted players to attack them. [[Spider]]s, [[wolves]], [[slime]]s and [[magma cube]]s can still attack successfully because they jump or climb while attacking. Most mobs never deliberately attack camels under any circumstance, even to reach players riding one; the only exceptions being mobs that attack most or all other mobs, these being [[zoglin]]s, [[warden]]s, [[wither]]s, and vindicators named "Johnny".

Baby camels cannot be equipped or ridden.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}

Camels follow players holding [[cactus]] but stop following when separated from the player by at least 10 blocks{{Only|JE}} / 16 blocks{{Only|BE}}. Sitting camels immediately start to stand up and follow once they notice the player holding cactus. Additionally, baby camels follow adults.

A player can [[breed]] camels by using [[cactus]]. After breeding, a baby camel spawns and 1–7 [[experience]] is generated. The parents cannot be bred again for 5 minutes.

Baby camels take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow up, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} cactus. Each use takes 10 seconds off the remaining time to grow up.

== Trivia ==
* The camel's design pitch was made by developer [[Ulraf]].<ref> https://youtu.be/2cxUNoWNy50?t=3142</ref>
* ''Minecraft'' camels are specifically based on the one-humped {{w|Dromedary|dromedary camel}}, though the first model was based on the two-humped {{w|Bactrian camel}}.<ref>{{Mcnet|camel|Minecraft’s camels have just one hump – but originally, they had two! As revealed by Alexander Sandor in our developer diary, the first camel model in the game was “basically a teddy bear with two humps”. “I shouldn’t say it was ugly...” added Agnes Larsson. So, it got a redesign into the version you see today.}}</ref>
* According to [[Agnes Larsson]], the camel has an [[easter egg]] related to its ears.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X8oVJUyqo4 Making Minecraft Mobs: Meet the Camel!]</ref>
