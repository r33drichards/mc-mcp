'''"Lava Chicken"''' refers to both a remix of "{{AMCM|Steve's Lava Chicken (song)|Steve's Lava Chicken}}" composed by [[Hyper Potions]], and a [[music disc]] that plays the song when inserted in a [[jukebox]]. The music disc is obtained by killing [[chicken jockey]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
The "Lava Chicken" music disc is dropped by baby [[zombies]] currently riding a [[chicken]] (i.e. a basic [[chicken jockey]]) when killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]]. Due to a bug {{in|BE}}, [[husk]] and [[zombie villager]] chicken jockeys also drop the disc in that edition.<ref>{{bug|MC-299100||Music disc "Lava Chicken" only drops from zombie chicken jockeys|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-224103||Husk Incorrectly Drops Lava Chicken Record When Riding a Chicken}}</ref> Although baby zombies can ride other mobs {{in|be}}, they only drop the disc if riding a chicken. If the chicken is killed first, the zombie previously riding said chicken does not drop the disc afterwards, though the zombie will still drop the disc if it is killed during the chicken's death animation. The disc is also never dropped by killing the chicken.

"Lava Chicken" is a remix of "{{AMCM|Steve's Lava Chicken (song)|Steve's Lava Chicken}}". The track begins with a chiptune rendition of the main melody, along with note-block-esque percussion before more electronica instruments are added. At 0:46, [[villager]] sound effects begin playing the melody, and the original instruments continue playing them, but are moved to the background. At 1:13, the villager sound effects and some of the instruments playing the main melody stop. A simplified version of the main melody is then played until 1:25. At 1:25, the instruments that were playing from 1:13 to 1:25 stop, and a new instrument starts playing just the main melody. At 1:31, some instruments are added in to prepare for a drop. At 1:37, the drop happens, and the villager sound effects return. At 2:00, the villager sound effects stop again. Then another drop happens at 2:14 and the song ends.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "Lava Chicken" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "Lava Chicken", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 9.

==Trivia==
* The disc's obtainment through killing a chicken jockey is a reference to the {{AMCM|Chicken Jockey sensation}} spawned by the [[A Minecraft Movie|film]] the song originates from.
* The Lava Chicken music disc is the only item available in Survival that has a different [[rarity]] between {{JE}} and {{BE}}.
** This may be due to the differences in the mechanics of [[chicken jockey]]s between editions.
* In a twitter post, [[Torfi Frans Olafsson]] suggested that the disc itself may have existed in {{AMCM}}.<ref>{{tweet|_MINECRAFT_LIVE|1938148381278539987|How do you explain the disc canonically speaking… the painting could be any dog from the Minecraft world, but the disc is very much screaming Minecraft movie|June 26, 2025}}<br>{{tweet|torfi_F_Olafss|1938502308998054213|Perhaps Steve wrote the lyrics to a tune he heard in a music disc he found?
