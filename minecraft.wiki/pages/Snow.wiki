'''Snow''' is a ground cover and gravity-affected{{Only|be}} block found on the surface in snowy [[biome]]s, and can be replenished during [[snowfall]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Breaking snow with a [[shovel]] yields 1 [[snowball]] per layer {{in|java}}, or between 1 and 4 depending on its height {{in|bedrock}} (detailed below). [[Explosion]]s, such as by [[TNT]] or [[creeper]]s, also cause snow to drop snowballs in the same amount as if mined with a shovel. {{IN|bedrock}}, snow can be instantly removed by {{control|using}} a shovel on it if there is no block directly above the snow layer, yielding the same amount of snowballs as when breaking it.

'''Snowball drops in ''Bedrock Edition'''''
* 1 snowball for 1–3 layers
* 2 snowballs for 4–5 layers
* 3 snowballs for 6–7 layers
* 4 snowballs for 8 layers

If a shovel is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], snow drops itself at one item per layer, except for 8 layers, which drop a [[snow block]] instead.<ref name="MC-134408">{{bug|MC-134408||Breaking 8-level snow layer with Silk Touch drops snow block}}</ref> Breaking snow with any other tool, even if enchanted with Silk Touch, drops nothing. 

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Snow|Shovel|Wood}}

Snow breaks and drops nothing if:
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space.
* {{in|java}}, a [[piston]] extends or moves a block into its space.
* {{in|java}}, its support block is removed.
{{IN|be}}, snow breaks and drops 1-4 snowballs, depending on its height, if a [[ravager]] walks on it, or if a piston extends or moves a block into its space. 1 snowball is dropped — regardless of the number of layers — if snow falls into an invalid block space after its support block is removed.

=== Natural generation ===
Snow naturally generates covering all blocks in [[biomes]] with a temperature that allows [[snowfall]], which depends on the elevation. Only blocks with direct access to the sky can generate snow layers naturally (with the exception of some buildings in snowy [[village]]s, which generate extra snow in areas inaccessible to the sky).<ref>{{bug|MC-198006|||WAI}}</ref> {{IN|be}}, snow can also generate [[snowlogged]] in certain types of vegetation.

Snow generates where there is sky access atop buildings in snowy taiga [[village]]s.{{only|bedrock}}

Snow generates as [[pile]]s and in multiple layers as part of many snowy plains village structures.

By default, snow generates exclusively in single layers {{in|java}}, it can be modified with <code>/gamerule snowAccumulationHeight</code>. Snow can generate in multiple layers {{in|bedrock}}.

Snow also generates in [[Ancient City|ancient cities]].

=== Post-generation ===
==== Weather ====
In snowy biomes or in cold biomes at higher altitudes, the weather can produce snow instead of [[rain]]. In snowy weather, snow generates on random blocks with a complete solid top surface at integer y-values, with a block [[light level]] of 9 or less, with the exception of [[ice]] and [[packed ice]]. The rate at which snow forms is affected by the [[game rule]] {{cd|randomTickSpeed}}. {{IN|be}}, snow can also generate [[snowlogged]] in certain types of vegetation.

Below are the [[altitude]]s at which rain ends and snow begins, depending on the biome. The exact height of the snow line is randomized. In taigas, for example, the lowest possible snow layer forms at y level 153, and the lowest height where snow forms at all locations is y=168, with snow lines ranging between y levels 153 and 168 across different locations.

{{IN|bedrock}}, anywhere from 1-12 layers of snow can build up during snowfall, depending on the biome. {{IN|java}}, snowfall creates one layer of snow by default, and the number of layers that can accumulate can be altered by the [[game rule]] {{cd|snowAccumulationHeight}}: the default value being {{cd|1}}, while setting it to {{cd|0}} makes no snow form at all, and setting it to {{cd|8}} or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block.

Snow layers do not generate if the game rule {{cd|doWeatherCycle}} has been set to {{cd|false}}.{{only|bedrock}}

==== Snow golems ====
{{see also|Tutorial:Snow farming}}

[[Snow golem]]s generate a trail of snow in snowy, cold, and some medium [[biome]]s, or any non-dry biome {{in|bedrock}}.

== Usage ==
[[File:Thicknesses.png|thumb|right|Various thicknesses of snow.]]
Snow can be placed only on a solid block that is not [[ice]]. {{IN|java}}, snow can be placed on a block with the {{Cd|snow_layer_can_survive_on}} tag, or a block with a full top face and not with the {{Cd|snow_layer_cannot_survive_on}} tag. {{IN|java}}, snow breaks if its support block is removed. {{IN|bedrock}}, snow is affected by gravity and falls if it becomes unsupported, and breaks if it falls onto an unsuitable block. A player can jump up 1 block and 3 snow layers.

=== Cover ===
[[File:Snowy Grass Block.png|thumb|right|upright|Snow covered [[grass block]], [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]].]]
If the snow is on a [[grass block]] (or [[mycelium]] or [[podzol]] {{in|java}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-12277}}</ref>) the ground cover turns white on the top and around the sides. Snow does not damage tilled and hydrated field areas – it cannot be placed on farmland. A gravity-affected block like [[sand]] or [[gravel]] does not fall if snow covers the block below it, but the gravity-affected block does replace a snow layer when falling onto it. The texture of the grass block changes to snowy when a single layer of snow is placed on top.<ref>{{bug|MC-1483}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-32637}}</ref> Thicker layers of snow causes the grass block to revert to plain dirt when the block receives a random tick, similar to regular grass when covered by an opaque block. A plain dirt block with a single layer of snow on top gains a snowy texture if grass spreads to it.

Snow layers placed on top of [[nylium]] revert it to [[netherrack]].<ref>{{bug|MC-174639|||WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|bedrock}}, if [[leaves]] are topped with a layer of snow, [[particle]]s of snow appear to fall through the leaves from the snow layer.

{{IN|bedrock}}, snow layers [[snowlogging|can occupy the same space]] as one-block [[flower]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and one-block [[fern]]s and [[short grass]] and can be layered and mined normally. Snow cannot occupy the same block as two-block-tall plants.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-21688|||Invalid}}</ref> Placing snow on plant blocks causes snow to appear around them, but placing plants into an area where there is snow removes the snow.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-29695}}</ref>

=== Melting ===
[[File:Redstone Lamp melt pattern.png|thumb|right|Powered [[redstone lamp]]s melting nearby snow.]]
Snow melts if there is a [[heat block]]{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}} or block light level of 12 or more. {{IN|bedrock}}, it also melts in biomes without snowfall, regardless of block light or daylight level. If there are multiple layers, layers melt gradually in ''Bedrock Edition'', but they melt all at once in ''Java Edition''.

Some light sources can melt snow but many cannot. The melt radius is [[taxicab distance]].

== Trivia ==
*Snow can be stacked to a full block beside a [[cactus]] without destroying the cactus.
*Snow layers of 2 to 7 thickness prevent hostile mobs from spawning.
*In [[Spectator mode]], a player positioned at the correct height can see the snowy texture of the top of the grass blocks.
*Snow sounds were created by [[Daniel Rosenfeld]] scrunching a bag of corn starch.<ref>[https://www.20k.org/episodes/minecraft <nowiki>It turns out, there’s a much easier way to get a good snow sound, using a bag of corn starch...
Daniel: You just scrunch it [sfx], and that sounds much more like snow than actual real snow.</nowiki>]</ref>
