'''v0.1.1j alpha''' was released on Google Play on an unknown release date, providing support for older Android devices.<ref>The original version targets and requires at least Android SDK 9 (Gingerbread 2.3 – 2.3.2), while the J-version requires at least Android SDK 7 (Eclair 2.1) and targets Android SDK 8 (Froyo 2.2 – 2.2.3).</ref> One notable difference between this version and the regular version is that this version uses different sounds when walking on/destroying/placing blocks.
