'''Keys''' are joke items from [[Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34]]. There are three different keys: '''red''', '''yellow''', and '''blue'''.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mobs ===
The red key is dropped by the [[wither]], the yellow key is dropped by [[ravager]]s, and the blue key is dropped by the [[elder guardian]].

=== Cheat codes ===
These keys are also obtainable by typing the cheat code "IDKFA", not necessarily in the [[chat]].

=== Natural generation ===
{{LootChestItem|red-key,yellow-key,blue-key}}

== Data values ==
=== ID ===
{{ID table
|edition=java
|showforms=y
|generatetranslationkeys=y
|displayname=Red Key
|spritetype=item
|nameid=red_key
|form=item}}

{{ID table

== Trivia ==
*[[File:Green Key.png|32px]] A key with a similar appearance is present in ''The Europa Arcology Incident'', a game made by [[Notch]] in 2009.
*These keys and their cheat code are likely a reference to the original ''Doom'' game.
