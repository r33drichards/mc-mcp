'''rd-161348''' is a [[pre-Classic]] version made on May 16, 2009, at 11:48 UTC, which added saplings, made changes and fixed a bug.<ref>{{link|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140911065546/https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/rd-161348/rd-161348.json|title=rd-161348.json|date=May 16, 2009}}</ref> This is the last archived version of pre-Classic.

This version is available in the [[launcher]]; however, the copy in the launcher was last modified on August 6, 2013, making it technically not original. Additionally, it appears to be tampered with further, as it also contains the [[terrain.png]] from [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.13a|Classic 0.0.13a]], as well as signature files from 2013.

This version is duplicated in the launcher, as attempting to play [[Java Edition pre-Classic rd-20090515|rd-20090515]], instead downloads rd-161348.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Oak Sapling JE1.png|32px]] [[Sapling]]s<ref group="note" name="textures">The variant of rd-161348 from the launcher uses textures from Classic [[0.0.13a]], so its [[sapling]] texture is [[File:Oak Sapling JE2.png|32px]].</ref>'''
* Pressing {{key|6}} selects it.
** It was not on {{key|5}}, and nothing was on it, as Notch disliked the texture, trying to hide it.<ref>IRC logs (May 20, 2009)[https://web.archive.org/web/20140208190929/http://echelog.com/logs/browse/lwjgl/1242770400]: "''[00:50:09] <Notch_> it's very ugly, so i "hid" it one letter over. ;)''"</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Oak Planks JE2.png|32px]] [[Planks]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Oak Planks JE1.png|32px]].

=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Cliffs are now much more common.
* Objects in the distance appear a tiny bit darker.

=== Gameplay ===
* The game now runs in windowed mode again.
* Particles now follow the player's location.
** Player facing up sees the full particle rather than a sliver of the side.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* The crosshair (+) is made thicker.
* The block preview in the top-right corner of the screen has been flipped.

== Fixes ==
'''1 bug fixed'''
* Fixed rendering glitches where the world became invisible at certain angles.

== Trivia ==
* The launcher variant of this version uses textures from later versions.<ref name="textures" group="note" />
* The {{cd|terrain.png}} file used in the launcher build of this version is dated May 21, 2009 03:02 UTC+2 (in Sweden) and is bit-for-bit identical to the one used in Classic [[0.0.13a]].
* The "rd" before the version number stands for [[RubyDung]], a game Notch was working on before ''Minecraft'', whose codebase was later reused for ''Minecraft''. 
** This is the last version to officially use this [[Version formats|naming scheme]].
* This is the first version that has been duplicated in the launcher.
