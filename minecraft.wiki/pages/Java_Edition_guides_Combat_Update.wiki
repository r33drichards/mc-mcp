|-
| [[Ender dragon]] 
| [[File:Ender Dragon.gif|128px]]
|
* Can be respawned by placing one [[End crystal]] on each side of the exit portal at any one of the three blocks of that side.
** While respawning, beams shoot out of these crystals, that reset all the pillars. When done, they blow up and spawn the dragon.
** Subsequent dragons spawn new gateways up to a total of 20, but don't create new [[dragon egg]]s and only drop 500 [[experience]] instead of 12,000.
** When the dragon is respawned, the circle of pillars and the crystals reappear.
*** Explosion particles appear on the tops of the pillars as they are being rebuilt.
* The fight has been changed to be more similar to the one on the [[console edition]].
* They can no longer take damage from [[snowball]]s, [[egg]]s or [[fishing rod]]s.
* Its attacks have been changed:
** The "charge" attack has been given a great amount of knockback.
** Breathes fire/purple particles (called "dragon breath") while on top of the portal.
*** During the attack, it knocks back and damages all players on all angles in the vicinity (as if hitting with other body parts).
**** Immediately charges the player right after.
*** Right-clicking the dragon's breath cloud with a [[glass bottle]] turns it into [[dragon's breath]].
**** It is used to transform [[splash potion]]s into [[lingering potion]]s.
** Shoots special projectiles at the player called "ender acid".
*** These produce a dragon breath cloud on impact and light the ground on [[fire]].
** While on top of the portal, arrows bounce back and are set on fire.
* Tags can determine the dragon's phase.
* Its AI was changed:
** It sometimes returns to the center of the island to "perch" on top of the portal and shoot dragon breath.
*** It charges right after.
** Defends the obsidian pillars more, the further the fight progresses.
** Flies back to the portal once it gets killed, to complete its animation.
* No longer teleports through nether portals or End portals.
* Can no longer ride anything.
* Can no longer have status effects.
* Dragon summoned with {{cmd|summon}} now stays in the same position no matter what.
** Unlike a dragon with <code>{NoAI:1b}</code>, it still flaps its wings.
** These dragons do not show their boss health bar, nor do they take damage from any attack other than {{cmd|/kill}}.

{|{{Simple Guide table|New Gameplay}} 
|-
| {{EffectLink|id=weakness|Attack cooldown}}
|
* A meter shows up after switching items or attacking.
* Damage done now depends on the fullness of the meter, and attack does 20%–100% of normal damage as the meter fills.
* {{EffectLink|Haste}} and {{EffectLink|Mining Fatigue}} cause the meter to fill faster or slower.
|-
| {{EnvLink|id=items|Dual wielding}}
|
* Players now can use both hands to perform different actions using the left and right mouse buttons.
** For example, if a player has a pickaxe in their main hand and a torch in their other hand, right clicking places the torch.
* Added an extra inventory slot called the offhand slot.
* Pressing {{key|F}} switches whatever item is selected in the hotbar with the item in the offhand (including no item).
* The offhand slot is displayed next to the hotbar when it's not empty (left for right-hand players and vice versa).
* Only the main hand can be used for breaks blocks or attacks.
|-
| {{ItemLink|id=elytra|Gliding}}
|
* Players now can glide when equipped elytra.
* To glide, the player must press the {{ctrl|jump}} key when in mid-air, then the elytra spread apart like insect wings and the player enters a glide.
* Player can aim their view around to turn or adjust the pitch. Losing altitude increases speed, and gaining altitude decreases speed.
** Trying for too high a pitch reduces the player's lift.
* Directly hitting any surface while gliding causes damage proportional to flight speed.
