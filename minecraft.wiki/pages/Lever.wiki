The '''lever''' is a non-solid [[block]] that can be [[Redstone components|switched]] to provide [[Redstone circuit|redstone power]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of levers.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Lever}}
Levers drop themselves when destroyed, and when their attachment block is moved or removed.

=== Natural generation ===
Three levers generate naturally in each [[jungle temple]]. They also generate in [[woodland mansion]]s and [[ancient cities]].

=== Crafting ===

|Output= Lever
|type= Redstone

== Usage ==
{{See also|Redstone circuits}}
{{IN|java}}, lever can be destroyed by [[fluid]]s.
[[File:Lever positions.png|thumb|Five of the eight possible orientations, levers off.]]
A lever can be used as a player-switchable redstone [[Redstone components#Power components|power source]].

=== Placement ===
A lever can be attached to the '''top''', '''side''', or '''bottom''' of any full solid [[opaque]] block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), or to the '''top''' of an upside-down [[slab]] or upside-down [[stairs]] (but not to the bottom of a right-side-up slab or stairs). When placed on the top or bottom of a block, the lever orients itself in-line with the placing player.

{{IN|bedrock}}, it can additionally be placed on the top of a fence, stone wall or hopper, and can be [[waterlogging|placed underwater]].

When placed on the side of blocks, down is ''on'' and up is ''off''. On the top or bottom of blocks, ''off'' is north or west, ''on'' is south or east.

=== Activation ===
To activate or deactivate a lever, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default). A lever can be turned on and off as fast as it can be clicked.

[[Mob]]s cannot turn a lever on or off.

=== Behavior ===
While active, a lever:
* powers any adjacent [[redstone dust]] (including beneath the lever) to [[Redstone circuit#Power|power level]] 15
* powers any adjacent [[redstone comparator]] or [[redstone repeater]] facing away from the lever to power level 15
* strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15 (only if the attachment block is a full solid opaque block)
* activates any adjacent [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]], including above or below, such as [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.
* emits redstone particles to indicate that it is active ({{in|java}}).

=== Piston interactivity ===
Lever is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
