'''Invalid data value sandstone''' refers to item forms of [[sandstone]] with damage values outside of the usual range which sandstone can usually be obtained in.

== Obtaining ==
Without the use of [[commands]], invalid data value sandstone items are unobtainable in the last versions in which they existed without inheriting them from a prior version in which they were obtainable.

=== Transmutation ===
[[mcdf:Java Edition:Block Transmutation|Several methods of block transmutation]] can be used to obtain invalid data value sandstone in block form. These blocks can be mined from 1.2.4{{verify}} to 14w21b{{verify}} to obtain the item corresponding to these blocks.

For arrow transmutation, the initial block being transmuted must be a regular sandstone block, i.e. a sandstone block with metadata value 0. Cut or chiseled sandstone cannot be transmuted.

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java beta}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.2|Sandstone has been added. Invalid data variants exist as a consequence of how block and item metadata is handled.
|Since damage values use the value which tools use for durability, invalid sandstone items have a durability bar.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.4|The durability bar has been removed from sandstone with higher damage values.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7|Block transmutation is now possible, allowing for invalid data value sandstone to be created. However, the blocks must be broken from 1.2.4 to 14w21b to actually obtain invalid data value items.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.2.4|dev=release|Chiseled and cut sandstone are introduced, which occupy two previously unused sandstone block and item states.
|As a result, invalid data value sandstone items no longer stack and merge with other invalid data values.{{verify}}}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w25a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE1.png|32px}} With the introduction of data-driven item models, any item with a data value outside of what is accepted by the game has no model to point to, resulting in use of the [[Missing textures and models|missing item model]].<ref name="nomoremodel">{{bug|MC-70590}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w30a|Invalid data value sandstone, alongside other invalid data value items, now appear the size of a full block when held in third person or by another player or mob.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w31a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE2.png|32px}} The missing model's inventory appearance has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value sandstone also changing.
|The items also appear the size of a full block when held in first person and when dropped on the ground, and also appear larger than before in an [[item frame]].}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w43a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE3.png|32px}} The missing texture has changed, resulting in the appearance of invalid data value sandstone also changing.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=17w47a|Numeric IDs for blocks and items have been completely removed from the game, with different variants of sandstone being given their own string IDs. As a result, invalid data value sandstone has been "removed" as any such item now converts cleanly into regular sandstone.}}
