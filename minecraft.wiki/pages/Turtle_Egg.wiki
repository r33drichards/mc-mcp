A '''turtle egg''' is a block containing 1–4 eggs that each hatch into a baby [[turtle]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A turtle egg drops as an [[item (entity)|item]] when mined using any [[tool]]<ref>{{bug|MC-176865||Turtle eggs do not have an assigned breaking tool}}</ref> with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment. If broken without the enchantment, pushed by a [[piston]], or broken by a player or mob falling onto it, the egg breaks without dropping anything.

When mining a cluster of more than one turtle egg, the eggs break one at a time, instead of all at once. This is different from other clustered blocks, such as [[sea pickle]]s or [[candle]]s.

Breaking a cracked turtle egg with a Silk Touch tool resets the growth stage when the egg is placed on a different block.

=== Post-generation ===
{{main|Turtle#Egg laying}}

When two [[turtle]]s are bred with [[seagrass]], one of them returns to its home beach, and after several seconds it lays a cluster of 1–4 eggs on the [[sand]].

== Trampling ==
[[File:Zombie stomping on eggs.jpg|thumb|upright|A zombie stomping on turtle eggs.]]
[[File:Husks Breaking Turtle Eggs.png|thumb|upright|Two husks breaking turtle eggs by trampling on them.]]

Turtle eggs can be trampled by living entities (players, mobs, livestock, etc.), except [[bats]], that fall onto or stand on top of them. Eggs in a cluster of eggs are trampled one at a time until no eggs remain.

Under no circumstance can [[turtle]]s break turtle eggs. Crouch-walking (or "[[sneaking]]") on turtle eggs prevents them from breaking. Jumping of any kind still breaks the eggs.

Though eggs cannot be trampled by non-living entities like arrows, items or [[Falling Block|falling blocks]], they can be trampled by [[armor stand]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-271259||Turtle Eggs can be destroyed by Armor Stands}}</ref> When a falling block such as an [[anvil]] or [[sand]] block is dropped onto an egg, the falling block is dropped and turned into an item, leaving the egg unharmed.

[[Zombie]]s and their variants ([[husk]]s, [[drowned]], [[zombie villager]]s, and [[zombified piglin]]s) seek out and trample turtle eggs that have 2 blocks of air above them unless {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is false. The range of detection is a 47×7×47{{only|java|short=1}} or 11×5×11{{only|bedrock|short=1}} box, centered on the block the mob is standing on. When a player in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode is nearby (also includes [[iron golem]]s and [[villager]]s), the zombie (other than zombified piglins) prefers to attack the player rather than trampling the turtle egg.

Unlike zombies and their variants, other mobs do not seek out turtle eggs to trample them. However, they can still break turtle eggs by accident. Almost all entities, except for those mentioned above, when falling onto an egg, have a {{frac|1|3}} chance of trampling it. Standing on top of an egg has a {{frac|1|100}} chance each game tick of trampling the egg.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Up to 4 turtle eggs can be placed in a cluster on one block. Even though turtle eggs can be placed on any block, they only hatch on sand blocks. When adding more eggs to an existing cluster, they retain their hatching progress.

Turtle eggs do not require a supporting block below and unlike dragon eggs are not affected by gravity. Eggs are also capable of supporting lanterns hanging under them.<ref>{{bug|MC-169684}}</ref>

=== Hatching ===
Turtle eggs hatch on sand, red sand, or suspicious sand in the overworld.{{verify|edition=Bedrock|type=current}} Eggs crack over time and hatch after cracking three times. Eggs hatch significantly faster at the end of the night.

Turtle eggs have a 1/500 chance of cracking if they are [[random tick|randomly tick]]ed during the day. However, if the in-game time is between 21062 and 21904 ticks (3:03 am and 3:54 am), then turtle eggs always crack when random ticked. This is a roughly 48-second window for the player. About 95% of eggs crack or hatch during this night-time window. On average, an egg hatches in 4 to 5 nights. 90% of eggs hatch in 7 nights or less.<ref>https://github.com/jeremy-rifkin/MC-Turtle-Mechanics</ref>

When a cluster of eggs hatches, all eggs hatch simultaneously.

Baby turtles always hatch facing south.
