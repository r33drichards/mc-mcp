The '''reality vision''' is a joke [[helmet]] in [[1.RV-Pre1]].

== Obtaining ==

=== Mob loot ===
[[Zombie|Zombies]], [[Zombie Villager (old)|zombie villagers]], [[Skeleton|skeletons]], [[Creeper|creepers]] and [[Enderman|endermen]] can spawn with reality vision on their head. They have a chance{{More info|what is the chance? is it 8% like armor? is it affected by looting?}} to drop it when killed by the player.

== Usage ==

=== Player ===
Reality vision is equipped via the [[helmet]] slot. When equipped, it shows a [[wikipedia:Mini-map|minimap]] in the bottom-center of the screen (which moves when the [[player]]'s camera moves). The minimap shows all [[chunk]]s that were currently rendered. The player's location is represented by a light green [[beacon]] beam marker on the map.

The reality vision displays a vision overlay when worn, similar to the [[Carved Pumpkin|carved pumpkin]] overlay. Unlike the carved pumpkin overlay, it can not be disabled by pressing {{key|F1}} and can only be disabled by going into [[third-person view]]. The overlay is called <code>cantseeshit<!-- Do not change this; this is that word that is actually used-->captain.png</code> in the assets folder.

The reality vision activates a [[Shaders|shader]] when equipped (<code>scan_pincushion</code>), which makes the screen appear like an old [[wikipedia:Television|television]] screen. This shader can be toggled by pressing {{key|F4}}, it is also automatically activated when going from first person to third person. 

[[Sign]]s use the texture with the text "OBEY" while reality vision is equipped, a reference to the movie [[wikipedia:They Live|''They Live'']].

=== Mobs ===
Mobs wearing reality vision are nearly passive to the player. Undead mobs do not burn in sunlight when wearing reality vision, since reality vision counts as a helmet.

Creepers wearing reality vision completely ignore the player, [[Ocelot|ocelots]] and [[Snow Golem|snow golems]]. They can still be lit with [[Flint and Steel|flint and steel]], however.

Zombies and zombie villagers wearing reality vision do not attack the player normally, but still attack [[Villager (old)|villagers]]. However, zombies without reality vision could "call" zombies with reality vision to attack the player, tamed [[Wolf|wolves]], snow golems and [[Iron Golem|iron golems]].

Endermen wearing reality vision do not attack the player when hit, but are still angered when looked at without a pumpkin.

Skeletons wearing reality vision are completely passive.

== Trivia ==
* In ''[[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles]]'', '''VR goggles''' are a device invented by [[Doc Culpepper]], capable of allowing people to be transported inside of ''[[Minecraft]]'' through virtual reality. The goggles resemble rectangular shades, as opposed to bulkier VR headsets of the time. The design is rather simple and streamlined, with a near-flat lens with a triangular bridge and what appears to be a leather or rubber{{Verify}} strap. At the top is a metalic brow decorated with a diamond shaped object and the phrase "team work"<!-- Two words. --> engraved in the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]].
* A pair of VR goggles appears in ''[[Minecraft: The Crash]]''.
