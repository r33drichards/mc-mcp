{{More images}}{{Infobox video|type=Cinematic trailer|date=May 21, 2024|length=1:42|image=|production=[[Brokendoll]]}}'''Change your game, your way!''' is an animated trailer, promoting the introduction of [[Add-on|add-ons]] to the [[Marketplace]], demonstrated by the heroes of the game using several items from them.

== Summary ==
[[Steve]], [[Alex]], [[Makena]], and [[Kai]] are standing in a [[plains]] biome, gazing upon a golden portal. Steve decides to tower up to investigate the portal, using [[Planks|oak planks]] and a [[stick]] to prod it. Upon poking it, a lion pops out, wearing a blue hat. Kai and Makena inspect the lion, seemingly finding it cute, but it ultimately turns hostile and begins chasing them. While Steve and Alex watch their friends get attacked, more portals begin to appear, dropping additional [[Entity|entities]] such as cars, an alien in a UFO, a rainbow, and a unicorn.

While Kai runs away in fear, [[Sunny]] decides to be nice and feeds the lion [[Raw Mutton|raw mutton]], [[taming]] it. Later, Sunny begins mining for ores, taking the lion along. While mining, Sunny's [[Iron Pickaxe|iron pickaxe]] transforms into one from an add-on, enabling them to mine in a 3x3 radius. The scene cuts to [[Noor]] and [[Ari]] in a [[Dripstone Caves|dripstone cave]], blinded by darkness. Noor lights a [[torch]], discovering they're surrounded by [[Skeleton|skeletons]]. However, a golden portal appears above them, gifting them armor and items that allow them to defeat the skeletons. Meanwhile, [[Efe]] is swimming near a [[coral reef]], and gets discovered by several [[drowned]]. They swim some more, summoning scuba gear, and then a whale, which splashes the drowned away.

In a [[desert]], [[Zuri]] is placing several [[Poppy|poppies]]. Furniture and plants begin to appear around the house Zuri is constructing. Zuri then places down a decorative flamingo, before a bomb drops several hundred blocks away. Zuri lights the bomb, and gets away using a jetpack.
