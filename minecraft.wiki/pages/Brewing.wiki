'''Brewing''' is the process of creating [[potion]]s, [[splash potion]]s, [[lingering potion]]s, and [[medicine]]{{Only|education}} by adding various ingredients to [[water bottle]]s in a [[brewing stand]].

== Ingredients ==
There is no provided in-game recipe book for brewing.

=== Base ingredients and modifiers ===
Base ingredients are ingredients that can be added directly to a [[water bottle]]. [[Nether Wart|Nether warts]] are used to make awkward potions, and are the fundamental of the base ingredients, as it is required to make the majority of potions.

Modifiers are ingredients used to alter the properties of a potion or to change a potion effect into a different one. The [[fermented spider eye]] is unique as it is the only modifier that can convert a [[water bottle]] directly into a usable [[potion]].

==== Enhancement ====
Generally, upgrading a potion involves a trade-off between duration and potency. A potion with an enhanced effect has shorter duration, and a potion with extended duration cannot have an enhanced effect. However:
* Upgrading the effect of a potion that has no time parameter (e.g. [[Instant Health]]) with [[glowstone dust]] involves no trade-off.
* Increasing the time of a potion that has no effects with different levels (e.g. [[Fire Resistance]]) with [[redstone dust]] involves no trade-off.

==== Corrupting effect ==== 
A fermented spider eye changes a potion's base effect, often reversing it or producing a negative potion.
* A corrupted potion usually does the opposite of the original effect.
* Corrupting an enhanced or extended potion into an effect that supports the modifier results in a potion with the same modifier applied.
** Enhanced [[potions of Leaping]] or [[Potion of Swiftness|Swiftness]] cannot be corrupted.
** {{IN|be}}, [[potions of Strength]] II corrupt into regular [[potions of Weakness]].
* A [[potion of Invisibility]] is considered the "corrupted" version of a potion of [[Night Vision]].

[[File:Splash Potion Weakness.png|thumb|right|Splash potion brewed using [[gunpowder]].]]

==== Splash and lingering potions ====
By adding gunpowder, a drinking potion can be turned into a [[splash potion]], which can be thrown to coat entities within the place of impact with a status effect. Subsequently, adding dragon's breath to a splash potion makes a lingering potion, creating a cloud that inflicts effects on entities that enter its area.
* [[Splash potion]]s and [[lingering potion]]s can be modified in the same manner as their normal counterparts. For instance, a splash water bottle can be brewed with any of the base ingredients; the result remains a splash potion.
* The [[Lingering Potion|lingering potions]] can also be used to craft their respective versions of [[tipped arrow]]s.
** {{IN|BE}} there is an easier way of using cauldrons [[Tipped Arrow|for the same effect]].
* Splash potions have the same duration as the drinkable form.
* Lingering potions have only one-fourth of the duration of the drinkable form. For instance, a drinkable potion effect of 8:00 is reduced to 2:00 as a lingering potion.

=== Effect ingredients ===
Effect ingredients imbue an awkward potion with a particular effect but do not alter potion duration or intensity. When added directly to a water bottle, most of these ingredients produce a mundane potion. The exceptions to this are the golden carrot, pufferfish, turtle shell, and phantom membrane, which cannot be added directly to a water bottle. A corrupted version of a potion can be made by adding a [[fermented spider eye]] to it.

== Brewing recipes ==
=== Base potions ===
Base potions are potions without effects, brewed by adding a single base ingredient to a water bottle. Of these, only the awkward potion can be imbued with an effect ingredient to create a potion with an effect.{{only|je}}

=== Effect potions ===
Effect potions are primarily created by adding an effect ingredient to an awkward potion, which is created by adding nether wart to a water bottle. Certain effects require a potion to be corrupted by a fermented spider eye. The potion of [[Weakness]] can additionally be created by simply adding a fermented spider eye to a water bottle, and it is the only potion that can be brewed without [[nether wart]].

[[Undead mobs]] react differently to effects than other mobs. They take damage from potions of [[Healing]], gain health from potions of [[Harming]], and are unaffected by potions of [[Poison]] and [[Regeneration]].

Cures are brewed from awkward potions using different [[element]]s. Drinking these removes the specified bad effect. They cannot be modified into splash, lingering, extended, or enhanced versions.

=== Un-brewable potions ===

=== Custom recipes ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section = 1}}

{{IN|BE}}, brewing recipes can be customized through [[addons]] using the same system as other recipes.

== History ==
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||?|The brewing system was originally meant to be procedural, meaning that the recipes were meant to be different each time one generated a ''Minecraft'' world.<ref>[https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-magma-cube "The Mundane Potion is a remnant of an abandoned procedural brewing system—meaning that the recipes were meant to be different each time you generated a Minecraft world. But this didn't turn out to be much fun for the player and the system was abandoned, leaving the Mundane Potion without a purpose. "It's sort of like an appendix," says Jens"] – [[Tom Stone]], February 21, 2017</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2|Initially, the [[cauldron]] was where potions were brewed, though cauldrons were not assigned a block ID, rendering potions unobtainable except through [http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/673742-19-pre2-cauldron-block/ modding the cauldron] so that it would be obtainable. When the cauldron was obtained, potions could be brewed by adding water to the cauldron followed by certain ingredients. Correctly combined ingredients would confer purely beneficial potion effects, and incorrect combinations added negative effects. The system was complicated, lacked a GUI, and formed many duplicate potions (i.e. two potions that were the same could be made in several different ways), so Notch and Jeb came up with a new brewing method using a [[brewing stand]].<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|119710836469149697|A quick discussion with @notch led me in on a new way of doing the potion brewing. Cauldron is out...|September 30, 2011}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3|A brewing GUI was added and most duplicate potions were removed (the total possible potions went down from 150 combinations to only 25 different potions in 31 combinations). Some status effects available in earlier 1.9 pre-releases as potions became inaccessible (e.g. Nausea, Blindness, and Invisibility).}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4|Throwable [[splash potion]]s are introduced, brewed by placing [[gunpowder]] and any potion together in a brewing stand.
|[[Glistering melon slice]] was added to be the ingredient for the potion of Healing; the [[ghast tear]], which previously served this purpose, is now used for the potion of Regeneration instead.
|Converted certain ingredients into base-secondary ingredients (the [[spider eye]], glistering melon and [[blaze powder]] made mundane potion when brewed into a water bottle in addition to their previous functions), bringing the potion total to 28 different potions in 35 combinations.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.1|dev=12w01a|The time to brew potions was decreased to 20 seconds.}}<!--From what?-->
|{{HistoryLine||1.4.2|dev=12w34a|Brewing recipes for potions of Night Vision and Invisibility added.}}

== Trivia ==

* Although [[Jeb]] said that in [[Java Edition Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3]] there would be 161 possible different potion combinations with 2,653 in the future, in the actual third pre-release only 22 different potions could be made without the use of external programs. Of those, 19 potions had one of 8 different effects.
* By modifying the [[item]] NBT using an editor or [[commands]], it is possible to get a potion that cannot be upgraded into a splash potion.
