A '''netherite shovel''' is a late-game variant of [[shovel]] obtained by upgrading a [[diamond shovel]] using a [[netherite ingot]] and [[netherite upgrade]] at a [[smithing table]]. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the highest [[tier]] of shovel, having higher [[mining efficiency]], attack damage, durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[diamond shovel]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Upgrading ===
Like with other diamond tools, a [[diamond shovel]] can be upgraded to a netherite shovel, increasing its [[durability]] and [[mining efficiency]], as well as granting resistance to fire and lava when dropped as an item.

== Usage ==
=== Digging ===
A netherite shovel can be used to break dirt and soil-type materials faster. When breaking a block, it uses 1 durability. For blocks that break instantly, it uses 0 durability.

=== Dirt paths ===
A netherite shovel can be used to create a [[dirt path]] by {{control|using}} (not digging) the shovel on any one of the following blocks, losing one durability point:

* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}

=== Campfire ===
A netherite shovel can be used to extinguish a [[campfire]].

=== Weapon ===
Netherite shovels use 2 durability when used as a weapon.

==== {{JE}} ====
Netherite shovels have an attack speed modifier of -3, meaning they take 1 second to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]]. Netherite shovels deal {{hp|6.5}} damage.

==== {{BE}} ====
Netherite shovels always attack instantly and do {{hp|6}} damage.

=== Repairing ===
==== Combining ====

}}
A netherite shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[netherite ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two netherite shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A netherite shovel can receive the following enchantments:
