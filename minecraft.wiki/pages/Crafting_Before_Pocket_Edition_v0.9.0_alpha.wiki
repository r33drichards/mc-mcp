Prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]], the crafting system used was an old version of MATTIS, which stands for "Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System".<ref>{{link|url=https://www.mojang.com/2012/04/minecraft-pocket-edition-now-with-crafting/|title=Minecraft - ''Pocket Edition'' Now with Crafting!|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20191004200200/https://www.mojang.com/2012/04/minecraft-pocket-edition-now-with-crafting/|website=mojang.com|date=April 24, 2012}}</ref> The [[crafting]] screen used to have an in-game description for all craftable [[item]]s and [[block]]s. It was removed after the new crafting screen introduced in [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]], and then replaced by the classic crafting system with recipe book in [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0]].<ref>{{tweet|argo major|881985116100190208|#BetterTogether #MCPE Day 15: Classic crafting combined with regular recipe book style crafting on a touch screen UI, oh my!|4 Jul 2017}}</ref>

This crafting interface can also be found in the inventory by clicking craft.
