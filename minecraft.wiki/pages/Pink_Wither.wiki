The '''pink wither''' or '''friendly wither''' was a recurring April Fools' mob present in both [[Java Edition 2.0]] and [[Java Edition 15w14a|15w14a]].

== Behavior ==
<div style="float:left">{{FakeImage|align=left|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|p=Potted rose|i=Pink Wool| p | i |style=max-width:106px}}|Pink Wither build configuration in 2.0.}}</div>
=== 2.0 ===
In 2.0, the pink wither could be summoned by placing a [[potted rose]] on top of [[pink wool]]. The newly spawned mob has one head.

The pink wither was an undead mob that would follow players holding sugar, and feeding it sugar would cause it to grow more heads, up to a maximum of three. Unlike the normal wither, the pink wither is not able to fly. When a pink wither skull hits a block, it grows [[plant]]s in a radius of 15×4×15 blocks.

=== 15w14a ===
In 15w14a, the pink wither replaces the [[wither]], firing skulls that have a bone meal effect instead of the normal [[Wither (effect)|Wither II effect]].

When spawned, the pink wither has three heads like a normal wither. It also creates an explosion effect after spawning and has a shield after losing half of its health. The skulls fired by the pink wither firing are the same as the regular wither's, but pink instead of black. The pink wither's skulls often heal the entities, but can damage them, too.

== Drops ==
The pink wither drops {{xp|150}} and a {{ItemLink|Nether Star}} when killed, a bit like its normal counterpart.
