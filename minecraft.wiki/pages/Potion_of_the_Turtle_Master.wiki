== Trivia ==
* The lingering potion of the Turtle Master has the longest item name {{in|je}}, at 37 characters long with spaces, or 32 without. It's also composed of 6 words, more than any other item in the game other than items and books named through an anvil.
** The longest item names {{in|be}} and {{EE}} are "[[Hardened Light Blue Stained Glass Pane]]" and "[[Hardened Light Gray Stained Glass Pane]]", both having 38 characters including spaces and 33 without. However, these items are only available when enabling the "Minecraft Education features" cheat setting when outside of {{EE}}.
