The '''jagged peaks''' are one of the three tall [[mountain]] peak biomes. These tall and jagged mountains are completely made out of [[stone]] covered by a layer of [[snow block]]s.

== Description ==
Jagged peaks are more likely to generate in taller and more jagged and pointy peaks that often pass the clouds and can peak at Y=256, where they can rarely form large, flat plateaus. It is covered by a single layer of snow blocks with stone underneath often exposing ores such as [[Coal Ore|coal]], [[Iron Ore|iron]] and [[Emerald Ore|emerald]], and just like the [[snowy slopes]], stone cliffs can generate in steep sides to the east or north with only a layer of [[snow]] covering them. [[Pillager outpost]]s are the only structures that can generate here, and they often form large foundations of [[cobblestone]] due to the tall cliffs. [[Goat]]s can spawn frequently in this biome, and {{in|bedrock}}, [[rabbits]] and [[polar bears]] can also spawn here. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], jagged peaks use default environmental settings with a coolish color grading, making the biome appear colder blue. 

Jagged peaks generate in temperate, cold, and snowy biome temperature ranges, in negative [[World generation#Biomes|weirdness]]. This biome often generates next to [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], [[flower forest]]s, [[forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[dark forest]]s, [[taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, [[snowy plains]], [[ice spikes]], and [[snowy taiga]]s. Jagged peaks often border other mountain biomes such as [[grove]]s, [[snowy slopes]], and rarely [[stony peaks]], and they generate close to [[meadow]]s, [[cherry grove]]s, and [[Frozen Peaks|frozen peaks]]. Due to the high [[World generation#Biomes|continentalness and low erosion]] values, jagged peaks are almost guaranteed to have [[deep dark]] generate below them, often bordered by [[dripstone caves]].

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
