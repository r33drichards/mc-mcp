{{Expand section|Complete list of badges in the series.}}
Whenever a member of the troop achieves a certain accomplishment or task, they earn a badge, displayed on a sash as part of their uniform. These include badges for Urban Exploration and Public Speaking, among other things. It is known that there isn't a "Spycraft badge," suggesting the organization doesn't engage in espionage.
