'''Luck''' is a [[status effect]] found exclusively {{in|Java}} and {{LCE}} that increases the chances of receiving better loot from certain loot tables. It is opposite to [[Bad Luck]].

== Effect ==
Luck adds 1 × level to the <code>luck</code> [[attribute]], enhancing the likelihood of higher-quality loot table entries and bonus rolls, while decreasing the chances of negative-quality entries. Currently, only fishing utilizes the <code>quality</code> attribute. The modified weight of each entry becomes <code>floor(weight + quality * luck)</code>.{{Info needed|What is the default value of quality? 1?}} Negative levels decrease luck.

Players using a fishing rod enchanted with [[Luck of the Sea]] experience increased luck while fishing, equivalent to the <code>luck</code> attribute,{{Info needed|How much luck is added per level of luck of the sea? 1?}} without directly receiving the Luck status effect or enhancing their attribute.

== Causes ==
Luck can be obtained through various means:
