* Added a shift-click ability to the recipe book that puts all available materials in the crafting grid.
* Added a new white-and-gray colored notification that pops up when the player unlocks new recipes.
** The notification only appears upon reloading the world; [[Dinnerbone]] has stated that this is a bug.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/63lprq/snapshot_17w14a_out_for_testing/dfv6qw0/?context=1</ref>
