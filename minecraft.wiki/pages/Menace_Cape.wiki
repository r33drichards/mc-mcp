}}The '''Menace Cape''' is a [[cape]] that was given out as a promotion for ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', alongside the [[Home Cape]] and the [[Yearn Cape]].

== Appearance ==
The cape's design depicts the [[Movie:Obsidian Gateway|Obsidian Gateway]], as shown in ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'', against the red backdrop of the [[Nether]].

The elytra design depicts the movie's version of {{AMCM|Steve}}, as portrayed by [[Jack Black]].

== Distribution ==
Players could receive this cape by [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem#movie-cape redeeming a code], which could be obtained by watching any ''Minecraft'' livestream on [[TikTok]] for three minutes. This could be done between March 18, 2025 and April 6, 2025.

This task could not be completed normally in regions where either TikTok or its rewards program were banned. Players in these regions could still obtain the cape by circumventing the ban somehow (such as with a VPN), traveling to regions where they were not banned, or receiving a code from another player.
