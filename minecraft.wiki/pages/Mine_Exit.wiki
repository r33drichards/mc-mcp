A '''mine exit''' is a structure found in [[Mine (dimension) (April Fools' joke)|mines]], added in the [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine|25w14craftmine]] update. It allows the player to exit the current mine.

== Generation ==
This structure spawns in Mines. They always spawn one of many predetermined locations, however there is no pattern to generation. There are multiple different mine exit 'types', namely cave mine exits, surface mine exits, and rare surface mine exits.

== Structure ==
Mine exits look similar to the spawning location of a Mine, but the diameter is slightly increased and the roof only has four strips of slabs and stairs. In the middle of the structure, a [[mine traveling block]] is in the center to leave the mine.

=== File Structure ===
All mine exit structures are located in the folder <samp><code>[[client.jar]]/data/minecraft/structure/mine_exits</code></samp>. There are only two, <samp><code>exit_01.nbt</code></samp> and <samp><code>root.nbt</code></samp>.

<code>mine_exits/root.nbt</code> consist solely of a [[jigsaw block]].

== How to find ==
By crafting an [[eye of exit]], you can throw it like an [[eye of ender]] to have it point to the mine exit. This will damage the player unless you unlocked the pathfinder advancement.

By unlocking the lodestone exits advancement, compasses will always point to the mine exit of that mine, and by getting the starter compass advancement, you spawn with a mine compass in your inventory.
