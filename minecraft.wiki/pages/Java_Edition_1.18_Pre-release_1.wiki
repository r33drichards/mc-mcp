'''1.18 Pre-release 1''' (known as '''1.18-pre1''' in the launcher) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on November 11, 2021,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-18-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.18 Pre-Release 1|November 11, 2021}}</ref> which readds [[AMPLIFIED]] and [[large biomes]], makes some tweaks, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[World type]]s'''
* Readded "[[AMPLIFIED]]" and "[[Large Biomes]]". Their implementation has been adapted accordingly to the terrain generation overhaul.
** AMPLIFIED worlds now have terrain with the following characteristics:
*** Terrain rounded at Y=320, instead of Y=256.
*** Doubled offset above sea level.
*** Greatly increased 3D noise values, resulting in lower factor values inversely.
*** Doubled peak jaggedness.
** Large biome worlds now have terrain with the following characteristics:
*** Most biomes, except mountain peaks and rivers, are four times larger.
*** Multinoise slowed down by factor 4 for temperature, vegetation, continentalness, and erosion, but not for ridge noise.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Conduit]]'''
* Now has an assigned tool, the pickaxe.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Lava lake]]s'''
* Now only generate above Y=0.

'''Upgrading of old worlds'''
* Changed transition between old and new terrain to be less cliff-like.
** Surface height, biomes, and caves will now blend much more smoothly.
* Deepslate and bedrock now properly generate in upgraded chunks.
* Cave carvers now properly generate in upgraded chunks.

'''[[Features]]'''
* Rewrote feature generation system.
* Now feature generations are configured with [[placed feature]] files.

=== General ===
'''Data generator'''
* <code>--report</code> option now creates full worldgen reference files instead of just biomes.

'''[[Create New World|World creation screen]]'''
* Removed "Caves" and "Floating islands".
