The '''Better Together Update''' is the name of the update for {{el|bedrock}} 1.2.0, a major update released on September 20, 2017, that unified the cross-compatible ''[[Pocket Edition]]'', ''[[Windows 10 Edition]]'', ''[[Gear VR Edition]]'', and ''[[Fire TV Edition]]'' under the simple name ''[[Minecraft]]''. It also marked the debut of ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' on [[wikipedia:Xbox One|Xbox One]], replacing the previous ''[[Xbox One Edition]]''.

== Better Together ==
This update extended ''crossplay'' (short for ''cross-platform gameplay'', the ability of players on different platforms to play interactively in the same world) to virtually all of the newest-generation gaming platforms. Previously, the ''Pocket Edition'' had supported cross-play between mobile, [[wikipedia:Windows 10|Windows 10]], and VR platforms. This update added support for the Xbox One and [[wikipedia:Nintendo Switch|Nintendo Switch]], drastically increasing the number of devices that could participate.

The updated game was also designed to work with the Nintendo Switch and Sony [[wikipedia:PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4]]; however, both platforms did not initially receive the update. The Nintendo Switch deployment was delayed due to problems with cross-device connectivity and upgrading of old worlds<ref name="BESwitch">{{tweet|Minecraft|994693010481991687|Minecraft Bedrock edition hits Nintendo Switch on June 21st! Available both digitally and physically at retail, it includes the Mario mash-up pack AND the Better Together update. Already own Minecraft on Switch? You'll be able to update to the new version for free!|May 11, 2018}}</ref> and [[Mojang Studios]] was still in ongoing talks with Sony about a possible future agreement as the latter had previously declined to participate.
* June 21, 2018, [[Bedrock Edition 1.4.1]] was released on the Nintendo Switch.
* On December 10, 2019, [[Bedrock Edition 1.14.0]] was released on the PlayStation 4. Mojang Studios also stated that it would consider porting ''Bedrock Edition'' to macOS, Linux, or any other platform with sufficiently strong demand, further expanding the crossplay concept.<ref name="faq">{{Mcnet|better-together-faq|Better Together (1.2) FAQ}}</ref>

With the unification of so many different platforms under one version of the game, the nickname ''Pocket Edition'' became increasingly outdated. From 1.2.0 onwards, Mojang referred to this version as the ''Bedrock Engine'' or ''Bedrock Edition'' when distinguishing it from either the game as a whole or other versions of Minecraft.  The name "Bedrock" came from the internal name for its source code database. To emphasize the broad range of supported devices, ''Minecraft: Bedrock Edition'' became known simply as ''Minecraft.'' The original Java version of Minecraft, which had formerly held that designation, was officially renamed ''Minecraft: [[Java Edition]]'' to avoid confusion.<ref name="faq"/>

== Technical details ==
Even though the name changed, the update was a normal update for ''Pocket Edition'', ''Windows 10 Edition'', ''Gear VR Edition'', and ''Fire TV Edition''. On Xbox One, the update was released as a new game, requiring the user to install it separately. ''Bedrock Edition'' on Xbox One is free for players who own a digital copy of ''Xbox One Edition'', have played the disc copy of ''Xbox One Edition'' for at least 5 hours in the past 12 months, or have bought at least one DLC for ''Xbox One Edition''.

Beta testing for the update for Android and Windows 10 began on July 31, 2017, and for Xbox One on August 24, 2017.<ref name="how-to-beta">{{Mcnet|beta-test-better-together|Beta Test Better Together!}}</ref> The update was submitted to certification for 9 of the 10 platforms on September 15, 2017.

With the release of the ''Better Together Update'', the [[Java Edition|original PC version]] of Minecraft was renamed to ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' in [[Java Edition 1.12.2|1.12.2]] to distinguish it from ''Bedrock Edition''.
