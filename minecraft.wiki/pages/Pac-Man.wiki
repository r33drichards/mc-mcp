'''Pac-Man''' is a  [[Marketplace]] map developed by [[Gamemode One]] that crosses over with the popular ''{{w|Pac-Man}}'' video game franchise, featuring many characters from across its history.

== Arcade Machine ==
The Arcade Machine is the primary focus of the world, being an adaptation of a traditional ''Pac-Man'' game. In order to start a game, the player will need to interact with a literal arcade machine, cycling through the selection of mazes by {{control|hitting}} and {{control|using}} to select it.
=== Mazes ===

|-
| Maze 2 || [[File:Maze 2 screen.png]] ||  A easier maze with the energizers in the corners and a ghost house with four exits.|| Unlocked after beating Maze 1
|-
| Maze 3 || [[File:Maze 3 screen.png]] ||  A ghost-shaped maze with all four energizers in one spot.|| Unlocked after beating Maze 2
|-
| Maze 4 || [[File:Maze 4 screen.png]] ||  This maze has a symmetrical style pattern following the same "Complex Pattern" as the other mazes.|| Unlocked after beating Maze 3
|-
| Maze 5 || [[File:Maze 5 screen.png]] ||  A simple maze in the shape of a grid with the ghost house at the bottom and 1 energizer in the center block.|| Unlocked after beating Maze 4
|-
| Maze 6 || [[File:Maze 6 screen.png]] ||  This maze has a spiral effect with multiple dead ends as well.|| Unlocked after beating Maze 5
|-

=== Ghosts ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name !! Image !! Description !! Notes
|-
| [https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Blinky Blinky] || [[File:Blinky render.png]] ||  The most aggressive chaser. He targets Pac-Man's exact location and follows him relentlessly. || Blinky has a permanent aggressive expression as if he's angry at Pac-Man.
|-
| [https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Pinky Pinky]|| [[File:Pinky render.png]] ||  The ambusher. She targets a point four blocks in front of the direction Pac-Man is currently facing attempting to get ahead of the player to cut them off.|| Pinky has a calm expression and lipstick, because she's the only female ghost.
|-
| [https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Inky Inky] || [[File:Inky render.png]] ||  The unpredictable tactician. His movement is calculated using a vector between Blinky's position and a point in front of Pac-Man, making him harder to predict without tracking Bliny as well.|| Inky has a excited expression on his face and seemingly bounces up and down as he chases Pac-Man.
|-
| [https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Clyde Clyde] || [[File:Clyde render.png]] ||  The "feign-hearted" ghost. He chases Pac-Man if he is far away (Normally more than 8 blocks), but if he gets too close, he switches behavior to retreat towads his "home corner."|| Clyde seems to be more relaxed and controlled compared to the other ghosts.
|-
| [[Creepy]] || [[File:Creepy render.png]] || Creepy will generate periodically{{Needs testing}} and will [[explode]] when in close proximity to the player, destroying walls. || Original ghost unique to this map, based off of a [[creeper]].
