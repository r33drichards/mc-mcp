The '''Snowman Cape''' is a personal [[cape]].

== Distribution ==
This cape was given to JulianClark as a reward for making a meme about how he brought Ray Cokes to Notch because of a joke splash text that was in Minecraft at the time.<ref name=:0>{{reddit|jnc2p/notch_ive_brought_you_ray_cokes_as_requested||Notch! I've brought you Ray Cokes as requested!|jurrian}}</ref> Ray apparently is "his godfather."<ref name=:0/>

== History ==
{{Expand section}}
The account that originally had the snowman cape (JulianClark) was lost and presumably deleted due to not migrating during the Mojang account migration period.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/s/vFlcwq9OP8 "I lost my account way back"]</ref>
