'''[[Map]]s'''

* A [[compass]] and [[paper]] now create an empty map.
** An empty map has no data on it until the player right click with it. 
** The point on the player's world where the player right clicked it is the map's center.
* A map (with data) can be cloned. Cloned maps are stackable.
* Maps can be zoomed out (but not zoomed in).
'''[[Potion]]s'''
*The [[potion of Night Vision]] can now be brewed by adding a [[golden carrot]] to an [[awkward potion]].
