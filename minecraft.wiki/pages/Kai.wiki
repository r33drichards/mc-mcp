}}'''Kai''' is one of the nine [[Skin#Default skins|default]] skins [[player]]s can use in ''[[Minecraft]]'', and the eighth to be introduced. Introduced at [[Minecraft Live 2022|''Minecraft Live 2022'']], Kai is commonly seen in promotional material for releases such as [[The Garden Awakens]] and [[Marketplace Pass]].

== Appearance ==
Kai is typically depicted with wide arms, and warm skin. Their hair is blonde, tied together in a ponytail, with visible bangs close to their muted green eyes. Of particular note is their outfit, a black jacket with purple cuffs and highlights, on top of a black dress with a belt with a similar color scheme to [[crimson]] items. Instead of shoes, they wear rosewood sandals with white socks.

In the [[Character Creator|character creator]], Kai has approximately five unique items.
