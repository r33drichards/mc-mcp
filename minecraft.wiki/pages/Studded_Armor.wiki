'''Studded armor''' refers to four [[armor]] item textures which were found in the initial versions of <samp>[[items.png]]</samp>, alongside the leather armor, chain armor and plate (iron) armor sets.

== Obtaining ==
All pieces of studded armor were obtained in the player's [[inventory]] upon creating a new world, like other items that existed in the same versions. It was not possible to obtain additional studded armor from the environment or craft them from other items.

== Usage ==
Studded armor had no function other than existing as items in the inventory for testing purposes. Like other armors it could not yet be equipped.

== History ==
First appearing in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091231-2255|the second December 31, 2009 build]], the sprites technically did see use in-game, but this is of little significance as all sprites on <samp>items.png</samp> were used at the time, with basically no functionality. These textures were taken directly from one of [[Notch|Notch's]] games ''[[Legend of the Chambered 2]]'', in which they are named studded helmets, shirts, pants and boots.

The textures were ultimately removed some time between [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100204-1541|the 4th]] and [[Java Edition Indev 20100206-2034|6th of February, 2010]] in preparation for the actual implementation of armor and its mechanics.
