'''Start a New Minecraft Story''' is an animated trailer, promoting several releases both official and third party on the ''[[Marketplace]]'', with a plot concerning several players exploring the worlds of the content.

== Summary ==
The video begins on a shot of a large city with dozens of characters from different ''Marketplace'' content, exploring buildings labeled things such as "[[Hardcore|Hardcore Mode]]." Several of these people enter a building, where they are approached by a man in a top hat who welcomes them to the ''Minecraft Marketplace'', promising that "behind every [[door]], a new story awaits." Before he could finish, everyone rushes into the first door they see. They end up in the map ''Advanced Dragons 2'', where one player is frightened by the sight of dragons. Another finds them cute and runs off to ride them. They eventually end up in a [[jungle]], where someone using the [[Skin Pack|Cadmus]] skin flicks a [[lever]] and opens up another door.

They emerge in another world, which someone remarks looks the same as the last one, disappointed and bitter. Luckily, the entrepreneur appears and reveals to them the ''Ultra Cute'' [[texture pack]]. The entrepreneur next appears in a flooded hole, luring the players down into [https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/Bikini_Bottom Bikini Bottom] where they get to meet {{Wikipedia|SpongeBob SquarePants}} and friends. Satisfied with that DLC, one of the players demands "more" and opens the door to the ''City Living'' DLC, before transitioning to a parody of a scene commonly seen in ''Scooby-Doo'' involving a [[creeper]]. The situation is resolved when one of the players transforms into a [[cat]] and scares the creeper away, transitioning into a brief sequence showcasing the ''Morph into Mobs'' world. Another player asks for "something magical," and is then invited into [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Kingdom Magic Kingdom] where they get to meet {{Wikipedia|Mickey Mouse}} and friends.

The video ends with the entrepreneur breaking the fourth wall and inviting the viewer to join the ''Marketplace''.
