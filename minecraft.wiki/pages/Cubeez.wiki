== Trivia ==
* The ''Cubeez Collector Case'' has a few continuity errors on its front cover.
** The [[Snow Golem]], where it has no snow beneath it.
** There isn't a shadow underneath [[Steve]]'s player model, despite [[Alex]], [[Efe]], [[Kai]] and [[Noor]] having a shadow underneath each of their player models.
** The [[Skeleton]] that is inside the cave in the background missing its left arm.
** ''Zuri''<nowiki/>'s right arm is being rendered behind the [[Mushroom#Brown|brown mushroom]] on the small mound behind them.
** 
* The inside of the Official ''Cubeez Collector Case'' is printed with the texture of the [[Creeper]]'s skin.
* The description of each [[#Character_Cubeez|''Character Cubeez'']] states they are one of nine playable skins, despite only eight of them having slots in the Official ''Minecraft Cubeez Collector Case''.
** The player skin that is missing a slot within the ''Cubeez Collector Case'' is ''Makena'', the reason being is due to them being a '''''Golden Cubeez''''' character, the ''Makena Golden Cubeez'' depicts ''Makena'' wearing a [[Helmet#Golden|Golden Helmet]].
*** In the Woolworths Online website's metadata, the ''Golden Cubeez'' is referenced as the "Yellow and brown Rare cubeez." with no mention of ''Makena''.
* Only six of the nine playable skins are present on the cover of the Official ''Cubeez Collector Case'', that being [[Steve]], ''Alex'', ''Efe'', ''Kai'', [[Makena]], ''Noor'' and [[Zuri]].
