'''VR goggles''' are a device capable of transporting users into a virtual reality, typically one resembling {{MC}}. Throughout the franchise, at least two separate iterations of the object have appeared, one utilized in ''[[Minecraft: The Crash]]'' and another in ''[[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles]]''.

== Appearance ==
The goggles in ''Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles'' resemble rectangular shades, as opposed to bulkier VR headsets of the time. The design is rather simple and streamlined, with a near-flat lens with a triangular bridge and what appears to be a leather or rubber{{Verify}} strap. At the top is a metalic brow decorated with a diamond shaped object and the phrase "team work"<!-- Two words. --> engraved in the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]].

== Properties ==
{{Expand section}}
Upon being worn, the goggles can transport the user into virtual reality, giving them control over a [[player]]. Unlike in traditional {{MC}} and real world virtual reality versions, players have full control over their avatars, as if they were physically inside the game. They can bend their limbs, move their faces, and even feel some degree of touch. While in this state, players lose physical stimulation in favor of digital interaction,<ref>{{WSC|5|1}}</ref> though still appear to physically move to some extent.<ref>{{WSC|1|1}}, Ch. 5 ''Minecraft—Live in 3…2…1…!!!''</ref><ref>{{WSC|2|1}}, Ch. 3 ''When Adventure Calls, Answer! Adventure Won’t Leave You a Voice Mail.''</ref> These goggles can also double as an access key, making their worlds impossible to access without.<ref>{{Woodsword Chronicle|6|2}}<!-- Cite exact chapter and page this information is established --></ref>

Upon coming into contact with the [[Foundation Stone]], VR users are able to perceive a [[world]] from a fourth dimensional-like perspective. This appears to cause physical stimulation.
