The term '''sediment''' refers to all the blocks that share names with real-world sediments. The fictitious materials [[soul sand]] and [[soul soil]] are included because they're named as sand and soil respectively—their actual nature is up to the player's imagination.

* {{BlockLink|Clay}} – fine sediments; found beneath bodies of water and common in [[aquifer]]s
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}} – dirt too rocky for plants to grow
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}} – mixed-sized sediments that most plants can grow on; makes up the top layer of most land, above stone
* {{BlockLink|Gravel}} – loose rock chips; found beneath bodies of water, on some shores & mountaintops, and in solitary underground pockets
* {{BlockLink|Mud}} – wet dirt; found in [[mangrove swamp]]s
* {{BlockLink|Red Sand}} – loose mid-sized sediments; only found in [[mesa]]s
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}} – dirt overtaken by [[azalea]] roots
* {{BlockLink|Sand}} – loose mid-sized sediments; found on shores and in deserts
* {{BlockLink|Soul Sand}} – [[Nether]] material that can support [[netherwart]], but slows creatures that step in it; burns with a cyan flame
* {{BlockLink|Soul Soil}} – [[Nether]] material that's visually similar to soul sand; burns with a cyan flame

=== Topsoils ===
* {{BlockLink|Dirt Path}} – grass, podzol, or coarse dirt that a path has been worn into
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}} – dirt with grass growing in it; can support most plants
