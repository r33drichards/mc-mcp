'''Speed''' is a [[status effect]] that causes [[entities]] to move faster [[Walking|on foot]].

== Effects ==
Speed increases an entity's speed while [[walking]] or [[sprinting]] by +20% multiplied by the effect level. It expands a player's field of view (FOV) accordingly. 

Negative levels of Speed, which can only be obtained through [[command]]s, cause entities to move more slowly, similarly to [[Slowness]].
