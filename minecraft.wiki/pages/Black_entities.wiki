When an entity's origin point goes inside an opaque block, and it can be seen easily, they become '''black entities'''. This applies to mobs and some [[block entities]].

Minecraft simulates [[light]]; a mechanic that determines how entities appear. After light travels across the X and Y axes, it fades away, and light's trajectory stops when it hits the edge of an opaque block. Because of the fact that light stops moving when it hits blocks, there is no light inside an opaque block.

Entities' looks adjust to light in their environment. For example, if they went in a pitch black room, they would also be black to blend into the environment so that the player can't see them.

If there is no light inside a block, then entities whose origin point lies inside an opaque block, will turn black.
