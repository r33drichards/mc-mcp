A '''golden axe''' is a variant of [[axe]] that is crafted from [[gold ingot]]s. It can be used to cut down trees faster, to [[Axe#Stripping and scraping|strip]] [[log]]s and [[scrape]] [[Copper#Blocks|copper-based blocks]], and as a melee weapon that disables [[shields]]. It is the sixth-highest [[tier]] of axe, having the lowest durability, and having the lowest attack damage alongside [[wooden axe]]s, despite having the highest [[mining efficiency]] and the highest attack speed alongside [[Diamond Axe|diamond]] and [[netherite axe]]s. It can be [[Piglin#Piglin loved items|admired]] by piglins, and has the highest [[enchantability]].

==== Equipment ====
{{Main|Drops#Equipped items}}

A [[piglin brute]] spawns with a golden axe and has an 8.5% chance (9.5% with Looting I, 10.5% with Looting II, and 11.5% with Looting III) of dropping it upon death by the player. Also, {{in|java}}, [[zombified piglin]]s can drop their golden axe (with the same chance as piglin brute drop) if they have been zombified from a piglin brute.

=== Villager gifts ===
[[Weaponsmith]] villagers occasionally throw golden axes at players with the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect.{{only|java}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
Golden axes can break wood-related blocks faster than other tools. Breaking a block costs 1 durability.{{note|Blocks that break instantly don't use up durability.}}
<references group="note"/>

=== Stripping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a golden axe on a [[log]], [[wood]] block, or [[block of bamboo]] turns it into a [[stripped log]], [[stripped wood]], or [[block of stripped bamboo]], respectively. This uses 1 point of the axe's durability.

=== Scraping ===
{{ctrl|Using}} a golden axe on a waxed or oxidized [[copper]] block removes the wax if it has any, or otherwise removes a level of oxidization. This uses 1 point of durability.

=== Weapon ===
When used as a weapon, a golden axe loses 2 durability points.

==== {{JE}} ====
Attacking a [[shield]] user with an axe disables the use of the shield for 5 seconds. [[Vindicator]]s, [[piglin brute]]s, or other [[mob]]s with commands always disable the player's shield. Damage done when using an axe as a weapon is more than that of a [[sword]] of the same tier, though they take longer than a sword to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]], resulting in lower <abbr title="Damage/Second">DPS</abbr>.

! Lifetime damage inflicted<ref group="note">The formula to find the total lifetime damage is <code>ceil(''durability'' &divide; 2) &times; ''damage per hit''</code>. The durability is halved then ceiled because axes take double durability when used as a weapon, and the last 1 durability can also deal damage. The formula also ignores enchantments and critical hits, and assumes each attack is performed at maximum charge.</ref>

==== Unit repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
| head=1

| Damaged Golden Axe; Gold Ingot
| Golden Axe
| tail=1
}}

A golden axe can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[golden ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the axe's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden axes can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the axe's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A golden axe can receive the following enchantments:
