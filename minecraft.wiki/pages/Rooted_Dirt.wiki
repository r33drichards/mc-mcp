'''Rooted dirt''' is a natural decorative block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Rooted dirt can be mined with any tool or without a tool.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Rooted Dirt|Shovel}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Azalea Tree with Roots.png|thumb|right|The rooted dirt generated along with the azalea tree.]]
Rooted dirt can generate under [[azalea tree]]s. Below the first block directly underneath the trunk, rooted dirt randomly replaces blocks in a 5×5 cross-section centered on the tree until it reaches the [[lush caves]] biome.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding rooted dirt drops the block upon death.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 2 rooted dirt for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
Single rooted dirt replaces [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[clay]], or [[moss block]]s below [[Log|oak logs]] where azalea trees are grown from [[azalea]] or [[flowering azalea]].

== Usage ==
Much like [[coarse dirt]], neither [[mycelium]] nor [[grass]] can spread onto rooted dirt. 

While it yields itself when dug, it does not convert into dirt after a block is placed onto it.

Rooted dirt blocks can be converted into [[dirt path]] blocks by {{Control|using}} any type of shovel on the side or top of rooted dirt with air above it.

=== Hanging roots ===
{{ctrl|Using}} [[bone meal]] on rooted dirt causes [[hanging roots]] to grow below the block, if space is available for it to grow.

Using a [[hoe]] on rooted dirt turns it into normal [[dirt]] and drops a [[hanging root]]s item.

=== Mud ===
{{Control|Using}} a [[water bottle]], [[splash water bottle]] or [[lingering water bottle]] converts the rooted dirt into [[mud]].

== Sounds ==
=== Generic ===
{{Edition|Java}}:<br>
Its sound is between that of wooden [[Planks#Normal|plank]]s and [[Dirt#Generic|dirt]] variants.
