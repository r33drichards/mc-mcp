'''[[File:Oak Leaves JE2.png|32px]] [[Leaves]]'''
* Decay again, using an algorithm that checks whether it has a solid or leaf block underneath, it or is adjacent to a solid block. If it doesn't, it must be connected to a leaf block that is also supported as long as it's no further than 5 blocks away from the support.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Mob spawning]]'''
* Has been tweaked.
** The chances of mobs spawning are now lower, making certain items difficult to find.

=== Non-mob entities ===
