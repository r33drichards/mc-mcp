An '''agent''' is a mob that helps [[player]]s learn coding, by getting a player to code the actions on one. Agents can be programmed to execute several tasks, like planting and harvesting, mining, chopping trees, and building. It is only available in {{el|ee}} and {{BE}} worlds connected to a WebSocket server.  

== Spawning ==

In a ''Bedrock Edition'' world not connected to a WebSocket server, agents are [[Bedrock Edition unused features|unused]] and thus have no AI unless spawned by putting the command {{cmd|execute as @p run agent create}} into an [[NPC]], but can still store items given to them by a player in its inventory. Agents can also teleport between dimensions with the player. 

Agents can be spawned with its spawn egg, obtainable with {{cmd|give @s spawn_egg 1 56}}. However, they are completely invisible when spawned via the spawn egg.

== Usage ==
In ''Minecraft Education'', agents are used in conjunction with [[Code Connection]], and are programmable by a {{w|visual programming language}}.

In the ''Education'' and ''Bedrock Editions'', agents can be used in conjunction with WebSocket servers. 

Agents carry their own 27-slot [[inventory]], which can be manipulated by [[commands]] that the [[player]] programs one to use, or edited directly by a GUI that the player can access in-game, in any dimension.

The visual interface allows the player to drag and drop commands, structural constructs and other components into a sequence, and associate the sequence with a custom-named slash command, which can be executed in the traditional way, from the console.

Agents are completely invulnerable to all forms of [[damage]], although they are targeted by [[zoglin]]s and [[warden]]s. Agents pass through blocks, vehicles, and [[projectile]]s, thus making them unable to ride a [[minecart]] or [[boat]]. Agents cannot be [[Lead|leashed]].

Agents can push pressure plates and {{control|use}} [[door]]s, [[button]]s, [[lever]]s, and [[fence gate]]s. They can {{control|destroy}} some blocks that are indestructible in [[Survival]] mode, such as [[bedrock]] and [[command block]], except for [[allow and deny]] blocks.

== Trivia ==
*In [[10 Years of Minecraft]], there is a puzzle in the "Library" area that involves controlling an agent with [[glazed terracotta]]. On the {{BE}} version of the map, the agent is added in as a new mob, while on {{JE}}, it is an [[armor stand]] with remodeled [[infested chiseled stone bricks]] on its head.
*The agent addition in ''Pocket Edition'' was likely accidental due to ''Pocket Edition'' sharing the same codebase as ''Minecraft Education''.
