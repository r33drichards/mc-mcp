'''''Grid Runners''''' is a free [[Marketplace]] map developed by [[Noxcrew]] for [[MINECON Earth 2018]], consisting of 18 minigames designed to be used in multiplayer.

== Summary ==
Upon starting the map, the [[player]] appears in an info room, giving various pieces of vital information. Facing them are ten [[sign]]s, instructing the player on the rules and how to begin a round. Behind the player is a [[button]] that begins the map proper, but beside it are two more walls, promoting Noxcrew's [https://x.com/Noxcrew Twitter], [https://www.youtube.com/@Noxcrew YouTube], Facebook, and [https://www.instagram.com/thenoxcrew/ Instagram] accounts. Once ready to play the game, the player drops down a tube and onto a [[slime block]] covered in [[carpet]]s at the center of the map, as a narrator welcomes the player into the lobby.

The lobby is split into four main sections, each being a course where players can be on either the yellow team or blue team. While a game is in session, any non-participating players can go down a flight of [[stairs]] and watch the progress from extensive viewing booths next to the games. Upon starting, only the iron course is open, but a handful of other venues are available. Approaching the iron course, the player can see a promotion for [[Grid Runners Pro]], a sequel to the map with new features, and on the right is a diagonal staircase leading up to a costume shop, where the player can select costumes and wear [[armor|uniforms]]. Similarly, sandwiched between the diamond and emerald courses is a car shop, where players can ride cars similar to [[horse]]s.

Around the gold course, the player can find two paths of sorts. To the left is a staircase leading to a food court, with [[Wooden Stairs#Acacia|acacia stairs]] for chairs and a stand full of [[cake]]. To the right of the course is a diving board, which the player can jump off into a tube into a lower area of the lobby, where their fall is broken by [[water]]. Dropping down to this area reveals it to be a [[pond]], with a wooden bridge behind a [[quartz]] bridge, which leads to several long staircases leading upward and downward. Traveling down, the player finds a small patch of [[grass]] with artificial [[tree]]s, before reaching an artificial lake with [[tropical fish]] swimming, an [[planks|oak plank]] dock, a T. Rex [[fossil]] made out of [[sandstone]] and what appears to be a generator. If the player wishes to leave, there are several fan structures, identifiable by [[Carpet#Yellow|yellow carpet]]s, which propels the player upward. Alternatively, the player can advance up the stairway, emerging from doors between the courses.

=== Iron ===
'''Dig Down!'''
{{Quote|In the middle of a bustling city, someone had hidden a button at the bottom of a huge pile of dirt and gravel. Typical! Dig down and press the button to open the door.}}
Players are dropped into a small town area, and given a [[stone shovel]] to dig through several [[coarse dirt]] and [[gravel]] blocks with. Eventually, they reach a small pool lined with [[torch]]es and [[gray terracotta]]. Swimming over a little leads them to a button on a [[block of iron]], labeled "Press Me!" Pressing it ends the minigame, but the team must climb a [[ladder]] into a room with a [[Bed#Red|red bed]] and exit two [[iron door]]s to reach the actual exit.

'''Shoot 'em Up!'''
{{Quote|This Saloon owner won’t let you in until you shoot down all of the minecarts with your bow. The Wild West is a strange place…}}
Players walk into a [[badlands]] town location, underneath a wooden awning and before a saloon marked by [[banner]]s, walled off with [[fence]]s. Armed with a [[bow]] enchanted with [[infinity]] and five [[arrow]]s, players must shoot eleven [[minecart]]s. Six are on two artificial [[cacti]] made of [[green terracotta]], one is on [[red sandstone]], one is on [[oak log]]s, and three are in a unique black colored wood structure in a horseshoe shape. Once all of them are shot, the teams advance through the build into the next room.

'''Copy the Painting!'''
{{Quote|Channel your inner Bob Ross and copy the abstract painting on the left onto your empty canvas on the right. Instead of paints, you can step on the pressure plates behind you for each of the colours! If you place a block in the wrong place, you can use the shears to remove it and try again.}}
Players enter a room with a painting, which they must recreate. Walking in, they are given [[shears]] with [[Unbreaking|unbreaking III]], and can select stacks of 10 [[wool]] by stepping on [[stone pressure plate|pressure plates]]. The painting is randomized, but the color scheme is preset, consisting of blue, yellow, brown, lime, and light blue.

Once players complete Copy the Painting, they enter into a flat strip of blocks they must {{control|sprint}} across to the finish line.

=== Gold ===
'''Climb the Cliff!'''
{{Quote|Set in a canyon, you must parkour across the wooden platforms to reach the top of the cliff. Seems simple enough! Press the button at the top to open the door.}}
Players drop into a badlands biome, and have to go through a parkour course to reach the exit. To start, they must position themselves on [[red terracotta]] and climb a ladder onto a [[piston]] pushing a [[plank]] block, which activates via a [[wooden pressure plate]]. From there the team must jump across [[slab]]s suspended by slabs, and climb another ladder before reaching a tight platform of [[pink terracotta]] and {{Control|sneak}} around [[cobblestone wall]]s, before {{Control|sprinting}} off onto another ladder. Descending down a hall on the top of the cliff leads the player to a [[block of gold]] with a button, labeled "Press Me!" which opens the nearby exit.

'''Find the Exit!'''
{{Quote|Cities can be big and confusing, but this one isn’t! It’s just small and confusing… No hints here, it’s a maze and you need to find your way to the door. Press the button to open it and head on through.}}
Players arrive in an artificial cityscape, where they must find an exit. First, they must enter a cyan building, and walk down to a bottom floor into a door behind the stairs. Walking clockwise, they walk past [[iron bars]], and then into a reddish house through a door that leads to the inside of a cage with a ladder. The ladder reaches to the button, which activates the exit.

'''Defeat the Beasts!'''
{{Quote|We move from a city straight into a jungle temple. As you might expect, there are a few little rascals that don’t appreciate your presence here. Kill all of the skeleton and silverfish mobs and the door will magically open!}}
Players enter above a fortified [[jungle]] biome. Given an [[iron sword]] with unbreaking III, a bow with unbreaking III and infinity, and five arrows, they must defeat several [[silverfish]] and [[skeleton]]s. The area is two floors tall, the first being the top of a temple. Walking down stairs, players cross by three [[jungle tree]]s and can enter into the temple, marked with [[blocks of emerald]] and [[polished andesite]]. Killing all the enemies opens the exit on the top of the temple.

'''Deposit the Gold!'''
{{Quote|This one’s for all of you mining enthusiasts! The goal is to make a gold block. Use your pickaxe to mine gold ore, use the furnaces (and coal) to smelt it, then once you have enough gold ingots, use the crafting table to make it into a block. Once you deposit your block into the hopper, the door will open.}}
Players enter a [[cave]], tasked with crafting and depositing a block of gold into a [[hopper]]. Using an [[iron pickaxe]] with unbreaking III, they need to mine several [[gold ore]], smelt them in a [[furnace]], and craft them into a block. Gold and [[coal ore]] can be found throughout a long, descending cave. Once sufficient ore has been mined, they can be smelted in several different furnaces. Once the player has nine [[gold ingot]]s, they can climb to a lush surface area adorned with [[acacia]] trees to access a [[crafting table]], then return to the cave to a hopper lined with [[obsidian]].

Upon beating Deposit the Gold, the teams emerge in a platforming section where they must climb a ladder and jump across large blocks to reach the finish line.

=== Emerald ===
'''Defeat the Beasts!'''
{{Quote|Your first challenge is a spider cave. How lovely. The challenge is simple: defeat all of the spiders and you’ll be free to move on.}}
Similar to in the Gold course, players must defeat several monsters with an iron sword, bow, and five arrows. This time, however, the enemies are [[spider]]s, and the arena is a cave full of [[cobweb]]s.

'''Catch the Fish!'''
{{Quote|In eight pools of water, there are eight fish. Catch them all using the buckets in your inventory and the door will open for you.}}
Players emerge into an area with several pools of water, with [[cod]] swimming inside. With a [[bucket]], they must {{control|use}} the bucket on the cod. Upon collecting eight [[bucket of cod]], the team can advance.

'''Light the Lamps!'''
{{Quote|Use your excellent parkour skills to jump across the city to turn on each of the six lamps.}}
Similar to the Gold course, players are dropped into a cityscape. This time, they must activate several [[redstone lamp]]s, the closest being reachable through a ladder close to the entrance. The second can be reached by walking over a line of fences, while the third l be inside an orange building, behind the red building, and reached through [[quartz slab]]s. The fourth is inside a red building and requires parkour over [[red stained glass]] upward. The fifth is close to the exit, and can be reached through either wooden platforms or jumping from the red building. The sixth can be reached by climbing a [[smooth stone slab]] spiral staircase by the fourth, above the first. 

'''Find the Flowers!'''
{{Quote|Explore the beautiful garden, find the three flowers that we’re looking for and deposit them into the correct hoppers to open the door. Unfortunately all the while you’ll have to fend off a whole lot of zombies.}}
Entering into a [[flower forest]], players receive shears with unbreaking III and be tasked with collecting a [[red tulip]], [[dandelion]], and [[oxeye daisy]]. Making this difficult is the presence of several [[zombie]]s, who provoke and attack the player endlessly until the time limit is reached. The tulip can be found outside of a cave, in front of a green carpet in the shadow of a tree, the daisy being not too far above, while the dandelion is right at the entrance by an [[andesite]] rocks.

'''Bake a Cake!'''
{{Quote|Well that’s easier said than done. What kind of cake? Do you have any allergies? Only joking, it’s always the same in Minecraft! Traverse a small town build to find all the individual ingredients it takes to bake a cake (that’s milk, egg, sugar and wheat); craft it using the crafting table, and deposit it in the hopper to open the door.}}
Players are dropped into a cityscape, this time with an [[iron hoe]] and tasked with crafting a [[cake]]. To get a bucket, they must enter a store building with a device that drops buckets, marked with an [[item frame]] and [[sea lantern]], which they can {{control|use}} on a nearby [[cow]] in a cart behind the building. [[Sugar cane]] can be found right next to the cow, both growing and in a [[chest]]. [[Wheat]] grows in a greenhouse above the bucket store, which can be accessed by climbing a stairway above the sugar cane farm and jumping across an awning. [[Egg]]s can be found similarly, in a [[dropper]] on top of a building that can be reached by  jumping across a fan-like build made out of [[rail]]s. A crafting table can be found in the back, in front of a hopper. Once the cake is "baked" and placed in the hopper, players can advance.

The final challenge of the course is to run over two streams of water to the finish line. If they fall into the water, they can climb up with ladders and try the jump again.
=== Diamond ===
'''Shoot the Targets!'''
{{Quote|Search the cave for supplies and craft yourselves a bow and arrows. Everything you need is in there: sticks, flint, string and feathers. Shoot the minecarts down to open up the door. You can respawn the supplies using the button at the entrance should you run out, but be careful, that’ll spawn more spiders too!}}
A combination of Defeat the Beasts and Shoot 'em Up, players drop into a [[plains]] [[ravine]] and have to shoot several minecart targets. However, they are given only an iron sword with unbreaking III, and have to craft a bow by killing spiders instead. Below, crowded by [[gravel]], players can find a chest filled with [[flint]], and across from that another chest with [[stick]]s. Upon crafting a bow (automatically enchanted with unbreaking III), the player can quickly slay the targets and move onto a suddenly appearing bridge. However, if they run out of supplies there is a [[block of diamond]] with a button that can restock supplies.

'''Knock em Down!'''
{{Quote|An arena of zombies awaits. Your goal? To knock ‘em down into the hole in the floor! The pressure plates offer  useful snowballs and a slime block contraption to help you achieve your goal.}}
In this minigame, teams must knock several zombies into a pit, using either [[slime block]]s or [[snowball]]s. To get snowballs, they can stand on a pressure plate and gradually build up several stacks. To use slime blocks, there is a row of pressure plates in front of a window, which activate pistons and knock the zombies.

'''Mine to the Exit!'''
{{Quote|The premise is simple: mine your way to the exit! No clues with this mini maze, but we have given you a pickaxe to make life easier. Once you reach the door, hit the button above to open it.}}
Players are given an iron pickaxe, and have to locate an exit amongst several dozen stone blocks. Upon finding the secret spot, they must press a button to open the exit. However, potentially helping matters is that the window into the opponents' arena (visible in every minigame) shows the location of the exit.

'''Defeat the Beasts!'''
{{Quote|In an underwater temple, use the tridents to defeat the three guardians hiding within. The door will open automatically.}}
In this final iteration, players are given three [[trident]]s enchanted with [[Loyalty|loyalty III]] and unbreaking III, and have to fight three [[guardian]]s in a miniature [[ocean monument]]. The first is present from the outset, and likely be the first guardian killed or attacked. The second is inside the structure itself, in a room lined with quartz pillars and [[dark prismarine]]. The third is in a narrow passageway, identifiable through two more pillars and an iron bar window.

'''Climb to the Exit!'''
{{Quote|Your expert parkour skills are needed here! Traverse the jungles and obstacles to reach the exit. Press the button to open the door.}}
Players must parkour through several obstacles, beginning with four rings made out of [[oak]] and [[jungle]] planks. Jumping onto a [[bush]], the player must then platform across four [[plank]] blocks onto a wider platform with a [[spruce]] pressure plate, lowering a ladder. Climbing up, players can advance through a smaller, tube-like series of rings before reaching the exit.

'''Copy the Sculpture'''
{{Quote|In this small factory, there is an abstract sculpture just waiting to be copied! Use the pressure plates behind you to select your blocks and match the sculpture exactly. Use the pickaxe to remove unwanted blocks.}}
Similar to ''Copy the Painting'', players must recreate a shape, this time a three dimensional one with a [[diamond pickaxe]] with unbreaking III. The blocks available are red wool, light blue wool, black wool, white wool, cyan stained glass, and sea lanterns. As with ''Copy the Painting'', the sculptures are randomized.

The final race to the exit comes in the form of several rapids, lined with stained glass, similar to the Emerald course but more numerous and thinner. As well, the ladders are on both sides of the blockade.

== Trivia ==
* As the map predates [[Caves & Cliffs]], gold ore drops as blocks without [[silk touch]]. Similarly, without [[moss block]]s or [[Moss Carpet|moss carpets]], green terracotta and carpets are used to represent moss.
* Initially, the map was conceived as having randomized minigames. To do this, the developers made a list of "every interesting mechanic" in the game, however as they continued it became clear they were too intricate for a purely random experience.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://noxcrew.com/news-feed/memories-of-minecon-grid-runners?rq=grid%20runners|title=Memories of Minecon - Grid Runners|author=Noctis|website=noxcrew.com}}</ref>
** Among the ideas scrapped from the map were "ender golf," [[Redstone Dust|redstone wiring]], [[piston]] mazes, and a minigame involving sneaking around [[Enderman|endermen]].
** Another scrapped feature was a token system, with players earning a currency from every mob slain during gameplay that could be used to unlock and upgrade gear that would provide buffs during gameplay. However, there were concerns that inventory management would over-complicate gameplay, and so they were replaced with the costume quests.
*For a time, Grid Runners was distributed through the [[w:Target Corporation|Target]] department store chain.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://noxcrew.com/news-feed/gridrunners?rq=grid%20runners|title=Noxcrew's Grid Runners|website=noxcrew.com}}</ref>
