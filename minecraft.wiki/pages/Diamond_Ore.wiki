'''Diamond ore''' is a rare [[ore]] that generates deep underground, and drops [[diamond]]s when mined.

'''Deepslate diamond ore''' is a variant of diamond ore that can generate in [[deepslate]] and [[tuff]] blobs, and is more common than its regular variant.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The diamond ore block itself (rather than its [[diamond]] drops) can be obtained by mining it with an [[iron pickaxe]] or better, with the [[Silk Touch]] enchantment. When mined without Silk Touch, diamond ore drops a single diamond and {{xp|3|7}}. The maximum number of diamonds dropped from a diamond ore block can be increased with [[Fortune]]. Fortune I gives a {{frac|1|3}} chance for 2 diamonds, averaging 1.33 diamonds, Fortune II gives a 25% chance (each) to give 2 or 3 diamonds, averaging 1.75 diamonds, and Fortune III gives a 20% chance (each) to give 2, 3, or 4 diamonds, averaging 2.2 diamonds.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
[[File:Chunk of Diamond Ores.png|alt=Ore feature of diamond ores|thumb|right|Ore feature of diamond ore.]]
Diamond ore generates in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[Ore (feature)|ore feature]]s, and is more common as the [[altitude]] decreases. Diamond ore blocks have a chance to not generate if they are exposed to [[air]]; however, they do not have a reduced chance to generate if exposed to water or lava, making them appear more commonly on the walls of [[aquifer]]s.

Diamond ore generation occurs in four batches:

* 7 blobs of 1-5 ores per [[chunk]], from Y=16 to Y=-63. There is a 50% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.
* 1 blob of 1-23 ores every {{frac|1|9}} chunks, from Y=16 to Y=-63. There is a 70% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.
* 4 blobs of 1-10 ores per chunk, from Y=16 to Y=-63. Ore blocks do not generate if they are next to air.
* 2 blobs of 1-10 ores per chunk, from Y=-4 to Y=-63. There is a 50% chance to not generate an ore block if it is next to air.

Diamond ore can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. Diamond ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate diamond ore, which is more common than its regular variant because diamond ore is more likely to generate at lower altitudes.

Deepslate diamond ore also generates as part of [[fossil]]s that generate below Y=0, replacing some of the [[bone block]]s.

Deepslate diamond ore is most commonly found at Y=-58 and Y=-59.

== Usage ==
The primary usage of diamond ore is to [[#Breaking|mine]] it for [[diamond]]s.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* In some blob formations, [[ore]]s connect diagonally.
* After the [[Caves & Cliffs]] update, diamond ore is the only type of Overworld ore that largely keeps the classic ore texture, with only some minor tweaks to coloration.
* The ''Minecraft'' mechanic that diamond ore replaces coal ore in fossils that generate in deepslate layers, is in accordance with the common misconception in real life that {{w|diamond}}s form from highly compressed {{w|coal}}.
** In fact, diamonds mostly form from carbon that comes from {{w|carbonate rock}}s,<ref>[https://geology.com/articles/diamonds-from-coal/ How do diamonds form? They don't form from coal!] – Geology.com in 2012</ref> and are completely unrelated to coal which form from dead plants.
