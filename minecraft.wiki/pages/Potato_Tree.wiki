A '''potato tree''' is a type of [[tree]] found in the [[Potato Dimension]], added in [[24w14potato]]. It can be harvested for [[potato stem]]s and [[potato fruit]]s.

== Appearance ==
Potato trees vary greatly in size. The smaller trees resemble [[jungle bush]]es. The larger trees can be over 50 blocks tall and often have the shape of several [[acacia]] trees stacked on top of each other. A unique feature of potato trees is that they grow potato fruits, which hang from [[potato pedicule]]s, like [[lantern]]s hanging from [[chain]]s. These pedicules can be found hanging from stems or leaves in the upper parts of any potato tree.

Potato trees come in 3 variants, but don't have a display name. There is the regular potato tree (code name: <code>potato_tree</code>), the tall potato tree (larger than the regular tree, has the code name: <code>potato_tree_tall</code>), and the mother potato tree (the largest tree, with the code name: <code>mother_potato_tree</code>).

== Generation ==
Potato trees spawn naturally in the [[Potato dimension]]. They cover most of the [[corruption]] biome, and can be seen more rarely in [[arboretum]].

Potato trees can also be grown from [[potato sprouts]], although this sapling-like block does not grow into a tree on its own; [[bone meal]] must be applied in order for it to grow, similarly to [[Nether fungi]]. Potato trees share more similarities with [[huge fungi]]: they aren't flammable, and they generate additional blocks (beyond stems and leaves) that emit light, the [[potato fruit]].

However, unlike huge fungi, potato trees can sometimes generate with [[bee nest]]s. Also, unlike an [[oak tree]], generating a bee nest does not require the potato tree or sprout to be within proximity of a [[flower]].
