'''Lanterns''' are a [[block]] that emits [[light]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break lantern is [[pickaxe]].
{{breaking row|Lantern|pickaxe|horizontal=1}}
Lantern drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Lanterns can generate as lamps or lamp posts above farms and on some buildings in [[snowy tundra]] [[village]]s and in [[bastion remnant]]s.

=== Trading ===

== Usage ==
Lanterns can be placed on the top or bottom surfaces of most solid [[block]]s, although some require {{control|sneaking}}. More information can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

When placed below a block, the lantern appears to hang. They connect to [[chain]]s seamlessly.

Lanterns can be placed on the ground (if a supporting floor block is present) or hung (if a ceiling block is present). The type of the block (solid, opaque, transparent, etc...), given the block has top/bottom solid surface, does not affect the ability to hang of a lantern, similar to torches. Press use on the targeted block or a block adjacent to the air block the lantern is going to occupy to place it. If the latter is used and both the support/ceiling block is presented:

*Press use on the upper half of the adjacent block to "hang" the lantern below it.
*Press use on the lower half of the adjacent block to "place" the lantern on top of it.

If the block the lantern is placed on receives a block update that makes it so it can no longer support the placement of the lantern, the lantern is removed and dropped as an item (e.g: the lantern is placed on a trapdoor, and then the trapdoor is flipped).

=== Light ===
The lantern is among the [[Light#Light-emitting blocks|most luminous of light sources]], emitting a light level of 15. Lanterns also melt [[snow layer]]s within 2 blocks and [[ice]] within 3 blocks ([[taxicab distance]]).

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the inside of lanterns emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#f39a5e}}. The casing of the lantern blocks a part of the light and casts some shadows around the lantern.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Lantern is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].

{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* [[Turtle egg]]s can support lanterns placed both above and below them, despite the fact that this causes the lanterns to appear floating.<ref>{{bug|MC-169684|||WAI}}</ref>
* Before they were added to ''[[Minecraft]]'', lanterns were already present in ''[[Minicraft]]''.
