'''Jordan Maron''' (born February 10, 1992), better known by the moniker '''CaptainSparklez''', is an American [[YouTube]]r known for creating let's plays and animated music videos for {{MC}}. His most well known work are ''Revenge'', a parody of ''{{Wikipedia|DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love}}'', and the ''Fallen Kingdom'' series, which began as a parody of ''{{Wikipedia|Viva la Vida}}'' but evolved into a series of original songs with an ongoing story.

== In the ''Minecraft'' franchise ==
In 2013, Maron would coauthor [[Minecraft: Essential Handbook]], a guidebook for the current versions of ''Minecraft'' at the time. Two sections were specifically credited to him, one being about mining "rare elements," while another is a recounting of his first time playing the game.

During the [[Beyond the Pale Garden]] promotional campaign, an [[add-on]] created by him was released, [[Majestic Camping]].

In 2025, he and fellow creator {{w|TommyInnit}} held a stream filmed at the {{AMCM|premiere}} of {{AMCM}}.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2419304588|title=MINECRAFT MOVIE RED CARPET w/ CaptainSparklez|author=tommyinnit|website=Twitch|date=March 30, 2025}}</ref> Later in the year, he and the Fallen Kingdom series were featured in an [[HOW PLAYERS CHANGED THE GAME|episode]] of [[How We Make Minecraft]], as an example of fandom culture influencing ''Minecraft''.

=== Events ===
In 2017, he made a prominent appearance in [[MINECON Earth 2017]], with several of his videos being featured in the pre-show, including a demo of [[llama]]s, a music video about exploring a stronghold, and ''Dragonhearted'', the chronological finale to the ''Fallen Kingdom'' series.<ref>{{YouTube link|anaZMrtfMW8|Minecraft: LLAMAS, CURSES, AND MORE - 1.11 Exploration Update|CaptainSparklez|September 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|F0Oj4w2NE0M|♪ "Rush Over Me" - A Minecraft Music Video/Song ♪|CaptainSparklez|May 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|07rtl-zcQhg|"Dragonhearted" - A Minecraft Original Music Video|CaptainSparklez|November 19, 2016}}</ref> Later in the pre-show, he was interviewed by [[The LEGO Group|LEGO]] and talked about "noob experiences."<ref>{{YouTube link|7wG4KrrvXe8|Minecraft Moments 1: Captain Sparklez - LEGO Minecraft - Stop Motion|LEGO|April 22, 2017}}</ref>

Beginning in 2019, he would also participate in [[MC Championship]], including the [[Ender Cup]] and [[The Copper Crown]].

=== Voiceover ===
In 2014, he participated in at least two separate commercials for [[LEGO Minecraft]].<ref>{{tweet|CaptainSparklez|535900340684484609|I forgot to mention I voiced a commercial for Minecraft Legos a short while back which is kinda cool|November 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|ZLCk0n90E10|Brand New Awesome Sets - LEGO Minecraft - 2014|LEGO|October 29th, 2014}} ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210705024033if_/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLCk0n90E10 Archive 1])([https://archive.org/details/brand-new-awesome-sets-lego-minecraft-2014 Archive 2])</ref><ref>{{ytl|98aTYw91Jfs|Lego Minecraft 2014 Commercial|X Soft|August 23 2018}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|EJwRJEwToqE|Lego Minecraft 2015 Commercial|X Soft|August 23 2018}}</ref> 

In the episode {{MCSM|A Portal to Mystery}} of {{MCSM}}, Maron appears as a fictionalized version of {{MCSM|CaptainSparklez|himself}}. Within the story he plays a role in a massacre enacted by a villain known as {{MCSM|the White Pumpkin}}, appearing early on and in a bookend scene.

In 2021, he recorded a line for the video [[One Trillion Minecraft Views on YouTube and Counting]], celebrating one trillion views on ''Minecraft'' content on [[YouTube]], however it did not end up being used in the final version.<ref>{{YouTube link|fPiSHuiwQiQ|One Trillion Minecraft Views|CaptainSparklez|December 15, 2021}}</ref> In spite of this, his skin and characters from Fallen Kingdom still made a cameo appearance in the video, as well as the sister video [[Minecraft Celebrates the Community]].

== Trivia ==
*Although not directly involved, in a video revealing a brand overhaul for Mojang Studios, a reference is made to a line in Revenge; "[[Creeper]], aww man!"<ref>{{YouTube link|YosWmbHAr2g|Mojang Studios: New Name, Logo, and Trailer!|Minecraft|May 17, 2020}}</ref> At the time, this line was a popular internet meme, finding success outside the ''Minecraft'' community.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/creeper-aw-man-discord-game|title=Creeper, Aw Man Discord Game|author=Adam|website=Know Your Meme}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|cPJUBQd-PNM|"Revenge" - A Minecraft Parody of Usher's DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Music Video)|CaptainSparklez|August 19, 2011}}</ref>
** A [[splash text]] referencing the meme was also added the same year.
