}}'''Rainy''' is a [[character]] in the novels published by [[Max Brooks]].

== Appearance ==
Rainy is described as merely a common sheep mob, or at least near identical. Initially, Guy describes Rainy to be a black or gray sheep.
== Personality ==
On the surface, Rainy appears (and very likely is) a typical sheep mob, displaying no outward intelligence.

Its sentience is also thrown into question, if not demonstrably proven, in the chapter ''It's not Failure That Matters, but How You Recover'', where a building Guy constructed is burned to the ground by [[lava]]. Despite the stakes and Guy pleading for it and the other animals to flee, they do not.
