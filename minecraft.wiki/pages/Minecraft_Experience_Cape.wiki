The '''Minecraft Experience Cape'''{{only|je|short=1}} or '''MC Experience Cape'''{{only|be|short=1}} is a [[cape]] which is obtainable by visiting [[Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue]], an in-person interactive event.

== Distribution ==
Players can receive this cape by [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/redeem redeeming a code] rewarded after completing the experience. The codes must be redeemed no later than 30 days<ref group=note>This deadline is very inconsistent, with multiple official sources providing different redemption periods. The terms and conditions mention that codes can be used within 30 days after the end of the experience, but the redemption page mentions 60 days, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20250427231533/https://www.minecraftexperience.com/toronto/faq/ Toronto FAQ] mentioned 6 months. Because of this, it is highly recommended to assume that codes expire within 30 days and use them as soon as possible.</ref> after the event closes in the tour city where they were obtained.<ref name="MC Experience Terms">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/31114589569805-Experience-Mod-Minecraft-Experience-Promotion-Terms-and-Conditions</ref>

The code is distributed using one of two methods; which method is used varies by tour city. In some cities, codes are sent by email after visiting. In other cities, codes are distributed on printed cards when the [[Orb of Interaction]] is returned at the end of the experience.<ref>https://www.minecraftexperience.com/london/faq/</ref> Guests will not receive code emails from cities that use the printed card method; in those cities, the code must be collected from the experience.<ref name="MC Experience Terms"/>
