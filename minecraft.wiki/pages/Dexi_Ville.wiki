'''Dexi Ville''' is a ''[[Minecraft Education]]'' "wordcraft" map  created in partnership with the Swedish Prince Couples' Foundation, Prinsparets Stiftelse.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|url=https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/blog/dexiville|title=Welcome to Dexi Ville for Minecraft|author=the Prince Couple’s Foundation|website=education.minecraft.net|date=May 30, 2024}}</ref> The map is designed to teach reading skills to children, including words, letters, and sentences. It can also be played through the [[Marketplace]].

== Summary ==
[[File:Dexi_Ville_hub.png|thumb|The Hub.]]
{{Quote|Meet Dexi, a delightful hedgehog who adores stories. They love to listen to their grandma's tales and read books. Dexi dreams of preserving every tale in a massive volume known as The Never-ending Book.<br>They invite all the animals in Dexi Ville to share their stories, which Dexi eagerly records. Dexi believes these stories make the village more fun and colorful. Always the life of any gathering, Dexi is talkative and outgoing, and they are known for organizing the village's Midsummer festivities|Getting started with Dexi Ville}}
The map opens with the player spawning in Dexi Ville, before Dexi the [[Hedgehog]]. Before talking to her, she will give you two language options: English or Swedish. After selecting a language, Dexi will welcome you into her village, introducing herself as the "story keeper" of the town. As she puts it, her job is to "guide every visitor to fulfill their story," in the player's case they are tasked with filling in a "never ending book." In order to fill the book, the player must win various minigames, gradually unlocking four different locations that can be warped to on command. Alternatively, the player can manually walk to every location, guided by a directory beside Dexi. As a third option, the directory itself can also teleport the player by {{Control|hitting}} any of the locations.

=== Read And Feed ===
[[File:Dexi_Ville_barn.png|thumb|The Barn.]]
{{Quote|Meet Hopper, a chill and relaxed rabbit who loves taking it easy on the farm. They enjoy lounging around, and they’re happiest when friends lend a hand with the feeding tasks. Hopper finds joy in the rhythmic and rhyming texts of poetry and songs, which they share through interactive games that mix wordplay and leisurely activities.<br>Now, Hopper wants to help other kids find delight in reading at their own pace. They teach them how to rhyme, sing, and explore words in fun and laid-back ways.|Getting started with Dexi Ville}}
The first location the player can visit is a vacant barn, full of [[stripped log|stripped oak]] pillars, [[coarse dirt]], and [[hay bales]]. In front of the player after warping is a [[rabbit]] named Hopper, who asks for your help to feed various animals. Around Hopper are four [[white concrete]] spots where animals such as [[cows]], [[chickens]], [[frogs]] and [[pandas]] will appear, stationary. Above Hopper is the name of a specific animal that needs to be fed. The player will have a "food bag" item, the goal being to feed the correct animal by {{Control|using}} the item on them.

=== Ponder The Letter  ===
[[File:Dexi_Ville_river.png|thumb|The River.]]
{{Quote|Meet Björn, a big and cheerful bear who lives by the pond. Known for their love of nature and puns, Björn explores the outdoors, jotting down names of plants and animals in their notebook. They find joy in learning and sharing funny twists on words. Though they face challenges with reading, Björn sees it as just another adventure, steadily improving at their own pace.<br>In their game, they teach players to match the first letter of a word with a picture of something that starts with that letter, adding a dash of humor to help
them remember. Björn encourages everyone to look closely and enjoy the beauty around them, showing that learning can be filled with laughter|Getting started with Dexi Ville}}
The second location the player can visit is a large [[river]] with noticeable [[moss block|moss]] and [[mossy cobblestone]]. Sitting on a [[spruce log]] is a bear named Björn, who loves fishing by the river and "the silence of nature." Excitedly, Björn mentions various objects "hidden in the river," and asks for the player to help him fish. In practice, this is not a fishing minigame, but instead a matching game. Various objects will appear on [[lily pads]], with a letter block appearing above them. The player will be instructed to match the letter with the object; for example, blueberries are needed when a B block appears, while an [[apple]] is the solution to an A block. In order to select the item, the player can {{Control|use}} or {{Control|hit}} them from a distance.

=== What a day! But what day..? ===
[[File:Dexi_Ville_theater.png|thumb|The Theater.]]
{{Quote|Luna is a gentle wolf who deeply loves stories. They run a small theater in Dexi Ville, a cozy place where they feel comfortable sharing their passion with children. Although Luna is shy and takes time to open up, they have found a special way to connect through the magic of storytelling.<br>Luna learned many tales during their quiet travels around the world. Using costumes, props, and music, they bring these stories to life on stage, creating an enchanting experience that teaches important lessons. Luna hopes to help children remember these stories, offering them a quiet space to enjoy and learn.|Getting started with Dexi Ville}}
The third location the player can visit is an outdoor theater in a [[taiga]], with [[stair|acacia stair]] chairs and [[flowers]] resembling [[oxeye daisies]] scattered around. On the stage the player will find Luna the [[wolf]], who will ask for help ordering activities for her diary pages. This minigame will be simple, Luna will tell a story with many key objects pivotal to certain times of the day. After listening to the story, the player will have to place the correct items in a certain order. For example, Luna will wake up in the morning and decide to stay in her house, before collecting blueberries during the day, and planting flowers during the evening. This will clue the player to place a house item, blueberry item, and flower item in [[item frames]].

=== Mind The Mine ===
[[File:Dexi_Ville_mine.png|thumb|The Mine.]]
{{Quote|Meet Barak, a wise and seasoned owl who loves learning and sharing knowledge. They have visited many places and are brimming with stories. Now residing in Dexi Ville, Barak helps children play with words in a fun way.<br>They design games that let you hear letters and piece them together, offering a blend of fun and education. Barak, a bit old-fashioned and quite talkative, is wise beyond their years and eager to share their interests.|Getting started with Dexi Ville}}
The final location the player can visit is a mine, located inside a large [[birch]] building, identifiable by several [[lanterns]] and [[copper blocks]] outside. Descending down a dirtied, old flight of [[stairs]], the player will find a large [[copper ore|copper]] mine, with the player finding an owl named Barak, who claims to work in the mine all day and night. Using their "strong beak," they can mine ores with ease, but appreciate some assistance. This minigame will involve {{Control|mining}} various "letter minerals" using a [[diamond pickaxe]], and have to use them to spell the name of an object above a hole. For example, a car, a pencil, or a banana.

=== Library ===
[[File:Dexi_Ville_library.png|thumb|The Library.]]
Although not a minigame, the player can also warp to a library, where they will find the Never Ending Book. It will be displayed on a [[lectern]] between two [[ochre froglight|ochre froglights]], and will gradually grow in size the more the player plays or replays minigames.

== Trivia ==
* For whatever reason, [[goats]] in the Read And Feed minigame will be missing their [[goat horns|horns]].
* Despite releasing after [[Bedrock Edition 1.20.50]], [[bats]] use their original model.
* The names of the minigame are never given in the map itself, instead only a promotional article.
* Dexi's gender appears to be inconsistent or fluid; they are referred to as female in the Marketplace description, male on the Education website's page, and with neutral pronouns in a supplementary document.<ref name=":0" />
* In order to promote the map, an official mascot costume of Hopper was created and used at several publicity events.<ref name=":1">{{Citation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prinsparets-stiftelsen_yesterday-we-launched-our-new-game-dexi-ville-activity-7202301592681824256-WJUB|title=Yesterday we launched our new game Dexi Ville, The Wordcraft Adventure in Minecraft Education.|author=Prinsparets Stiftelse|website=LinkedIn|date=May 31, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prinsparets-stiftelsen_p%C3%A5-fredag-och-l%C3%B6rdag-%C3%A4r-prinsparets-stiftelse-activity-7216444388263022592-Ac5Q/|title=På fredag och lördag är Prinsparets Stiftelse äntligen på plats på Nordea Open!|author=Prinsparets Stiftelse|website=LinkedIn|date=July 9, 2024}}</ref>
