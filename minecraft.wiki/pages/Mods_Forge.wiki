'''Minecraft Forge''' is a free, open-source modding API and loader designed to simplify compatibility between community-created game [[mods]] in ''[[Minecraft: Java Edition]]''. The end-user (player) must play the version of ''Minecraft'' that Forge was downloaded for before it can be used. For example, Forge 1.12 needs the 1.12 version of ''Minecraft'' in order to run correctly. Forge can then be used from the Play drop-down in the ''Minecraft'' launcher.

== Forge modifications ==
The majority of modern modifications use Forge in order to be added to vanilla Minecraft, some modifications that support Forge are listed on its website.

Forge modifications only work with Forge. Forge processes modifications differently than Modloader, so only certain modifications can work with the two.

The user may want to see if the modification they want supports Forge. 

'''Windows:'''

On Windows the modifications folder is located in the directory '''.minecraft\mods''' and is generated after Forge is run at least once. To reach the directory, press {{keys|Windows + R}} and type '''%appdata%/.minecraft''' into the search box and hit {{keys|Enter}}. 

'''macOS:'''

On macOS the modifications folder is located in the directory '''~/Library/Application Support/minecraft''' and is generated after Forge has run at least once. To reach the directory, press {{keys|Command + Shift + G}} while a Finder window is selected and enter '''''~/Library/Application Support/minecraft''''' . 

'''Linux:'''

On linux the modifications folder is located in the directory '''~/.minecraft''' and is generated after Forge is run at least once. To reach the directory on Nautilus, press the {{keys|ctrl + H}} in the home directory and the minecraft folder should be revealed.

== Installing Forge mods ==
In order to install and use modifications in the game using Forge, the software may be downloaded from https://files.minecraftforge.net/. Forge modifications can be used on any version on Java Edition 1.1 or above, and Forge is strongly recommended to be kept up to date. Forge does not have a user interface itself.
