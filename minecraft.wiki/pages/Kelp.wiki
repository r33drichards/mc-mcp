'''Kelp''' is an underwater alga that generates in most [[ocean]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Kelp can be mined instantly with any [[tool]] or with the player's fist. Removing water from the kelp block destroys the kelp. Breaking one part of a kelp stalk destroys all kelp [[block]]s above it. Each block drops a kelp [[item (entity)|item]].
{{breaking row|Kelp|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Kelp (feature)}}
Kelp naturally generates in any [[ocean]] biomes (except in [[Frozen Ocean|frozen]], [[Deep Frozen Ocean|deep frozen]] and [[Warm Ocean|warm]]), near and around [[seagrass]]. Each chunk has {{frac|1|18}} chance to generate a [[vegetation]] of kelp.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 kelp for 3 [[emerald]]s.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Kelp can be placed underwater by hand, or anywhere by the use of [[commands]] such as {{cmd|setblock}}. Placing it by hand gives it a random {{code|age}} value between 0 and 24. Kelp can be placed only in [[water]] source blocks or downward-flowing water, not horizontally flowing water.

When placed in downward-flowing water, the kelp becomes waterlogged, transforming the flowing water into a water source block,<ref>{{bug|MC-133814}}</ref> which is useful for faster [[bubble column]] elevator creation.

Any building block can be placed on top of a kelp plant, which is useful for building structures over a deep ocean without needing to build from the ocean floor (see also [[lily pad]]).

=== Cooking ingredient ===

| Dried Kelp

}}

=== Composting ===
Placing kelp into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Growth mechanics ===
Kelp can be planted on a broad variety of blocks. It grows underwater if it has either a source block of water or flowing water above it.<ref>{{bug|MC-133354}}</ref> Neither [[player]]s nor [[dispenser]]s can remove the water source block that kelp grows in without breaking the kelp first.

Kelp does not require any [[light]] level to grow. Kelp also grows without having [[sky]] access. [[Bone meal]] can be used to grow kelp by 1 block on each use.

When kelp is planted, it is generated with a randomly chosen age value, which can be checked when pressing [[Debug screen|<kbd>F3</kbd>]]{{only|java}}. The age value of a newly planted kelp plant varies randomly from 0 to 24. Each time the kelp grows in height by one block, the newly generated top of the kelp plant increases its age by 1. When the top block of the kelp plant reaches an age of 25, it stops growing. This means that kelp can naturally grow to a height between 2 (if the first kelp plant had an age of 24) and 26 blocks (if the first kelp plant had an age of 0). 

When a kelp plant block is broken, the age of the kelp plant block underneath is randomized to a value from 0 to 24 and the kelp continues growing until it reaches age 25. It is possible to use this mechanic to cultivate a kelp plant to increase its growth height beyond its natural maximum height of 26 blocks. This can be done by breaking the top-most block of the kelp plant each time it reaches age 25. A kelp plant cultivated by a player in this way repeatedly grows until it reaches the water surface.

Each time it receives a [[random tick]], kelp has a 14% chance of growing. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every 9752 game ticks (487.6 seconds).

Using [[shears]] on the topmost block of kelp prevents further growth by setting its <code>age</code> value to <code>25</code>.

=== Farming ===
{{Main|Tutorial:Kelp farming}}
Kelp farming is similar to farming [[sugar cane]], although kelp must be placed underwater. Automation of harvest is easier because items float up in water source blocks.

== Trivia ==
* In real life, {{w|kelp}} is not considered a {{w|plant}}. It is classified by scientists as a {{w|brown algae}}.
** Kelp in real life absorbs nutrients directly from the water, instead of through its root-like structure, [[wikipedia:Holdfast (biology)|holdfast]], which merely attaches it to the seabed. This is in accordance with kelp being able to grow on almost any solid block in ''Minecraft''.
