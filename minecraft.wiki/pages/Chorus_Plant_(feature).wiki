A '''chorus plant''' is a plant-like [[feature]] that generates in the highlands of the [[Terrain features#Outer islands|outer End islands]].

== Generation ==
Chorus plants generate on the outer islands of [[the End]], in End highlands. They are formed in tall, coral-like patterns. They are the only source of [[chorus fruit]] and [[chorus flower]]s. The player can grow a new chorus plant by planting such a flower on a block of [[End stone]].

== Construction ==
Chorus plants consist of [[Chorus Plant|chorus plant block]]s and chorus flowers. A chorus flower generates at the top of each branch. A branch stops growing when the chorus flower on the branch reaches age 5, but it can be harvested and replanted to reset the age. Plant heights range between 5 and 22 blocks, although most stop growing before they reach 16 blocks tall.

== Trivia ==
* The smallest possible fully-grown chorus plant (assuming the growth is not obstructed) would have 5 [[Chorus Plant|chorus plant block]]s.
* According to Jeb in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3TXUTLClb0&t=0s Ask Mojang midsummer special with Jeb], the chorus plant got its name from the soft sound it was supposed to make when it grew. He stated it was not supposed to actually sound like a chorus, but the idea of a forest of chorus plants created a choir together.
* [[Dinnerbone]] took inspiration for chorus plants from real-life banana plants, which need to be replanted each time they bear fruit.<ref>{{ytl|PIAP8peEppI|The Beginning - Part 1: 15 Years of Minecraft|Minecraft|Jun 3, 2024|t=595s}}</ref>
