'''16w50a''' is the first and only [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11.1]], released on December 15, 2016,<ref name="blogpost_16w50a">{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215151908/http://mojang.com/2016/12/minecraft-snapshot-16w50a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 16w50a|author=[[Maria Lemon]]|website=mojang.com|date=Dec 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1112-released|Minecraft 1.11.1 Released}}</ref> which adds [[iron nugget]]s, the [[Sweeping Edge]] enchantment, the ability to boost [[elytra]] with fireworks, and fixes bugs. This is the final snapshot released in 2016.

A pre-release version for 1.11.1 was uploaded to Mojang's server at the same time as 16w50a, titled '''1.11.1''' in-game. This upload was likely a mistake. 16w50a fixed two bugs from the 1.11.1 pre-release that were not present in the [[bug tracker]].

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Iron Nugget JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Iron nugget]]s'''
* Can be crafted from [[iron ingot]]s, but are also received from smelting iron tools and armor.

=== Enchantments ===
'''[[File:Enchanted Book.gif|32px]] [[Sweeping Edge]]'''
* Can be applied to a [[sword]] to increase the damage of the sweep attack.
** Level 3 makes the sweep attack damage 75% that of the regular attack damage.

== Changes ==
'''[[Damage#Attack cooldown|Attack indicator]]'''
* When in crosshair mode, the weapon is fully cooled, and a mob or entity is in range of attack, the attack indicator is visible and includes a small exclamation point underneath the crosshair (later changed to a plus-sign (+) in the final release<ref>[https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-111635 MC-111635 resolved as "Works as Intended"]</ref>)

'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* Mending is no longer compatible with Infinity on [[bow]]s when trying to apply it in Survival or when using the {{cmd|enchant}} command.
** In this snapshot, however, players can still add Mending to an Infinity bow, but not vice versa.
** The player can also put Infinity on a Mending enchantment book, but not vice versa.
** Old bows with both enchantments applied still keep their enchantments and remain working as they used to.

'''[[Fireworks]]'''
* While flying using [[elytra]], using a firework gives the player a boost for a certain amount of time. This emits a particle when in use.
** Fireworks stay at the players location until they disappear or explode.
** Longer flight duration on the rocket makes the boost last longer. The player can increase the flight duration of a firework by crafting it with gunpowder in the other slots.
** Fireworks with an explosion deal damage at the end of their flight.
** The right-click on a block action for the fireworks is prioritized over the right-click ability in midair. This simply means that when the player looks at a block while flying and right-clicking, the rocket shoots regularly, instead of being used as a boost.
* Firework explosions now hurt surrounding mobs and players.
** The damage radius of the explosion is about 2-3 blocks and is the same for any shape (large ball, creeper, burst, etc.) and the damage decreases with the distance to the explosion.
** The damage amount at close range is about {{Hp|5}} without armor on, and with full diamond armor, it equates to about {{Hp|1}}.
** Death message is "[player] went off with a bang".

'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* Iron and golden tools and armor can be smelted into nuggets. Iron and golden horse armor can also be smelted.
** Yield 1 iron or golden nugget per item respectively.

'''[[Totem of undying]]'''
* ID name changed from <code>totem</code> to <code>totem_of_undying</code>.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Removed the 'Junk Fished' and 'Treasure Fished' statistics.

'''[[Piston]]s'''
* Added a new byte tag <code>source</code> for the <code>piston_extension</code> block entity, which is true if the block represents the piston head itself, and false if it represents a block being pushed.

'''[[Arrow]]s'''
* Added a new integer tag <code>Color</code> to be used by the <code>arrow</code> entity, for displaying the custom potion color of a fired arrow item that had a <code>CustomPotionColor</code> tag.

* Fixed a server-side crash for new players loading into a world.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* 16w50a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* This was the last snapshot and any sort of update to be announced on the [[Mojang blog]].
** This also happened to be announced after they moved to minecraft.net, despite them saying they would post no more news.
* This was also the last development version to be cross-compatible with a full version of {{JE}}.
