=== Announcement ===
The Java account migration was announced on October 21, 2020 with a YouTube video, a [[Minecraft.net]] article, and an official FAQ.<ref name="announcement"/><ref name="movinghouse">{{mcnet|java-edition-moving-house|Java Edition is moving house|October 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021201756/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492|title=JAVA Account Migration FAQ - Home|website=Minecraft.net|date=October 21, 2020}}</ref> The migration was described as a way to increase security through the addition of {{w|two-factor authentication}}, connect all Mojang games to the same account, improve parental controls, and add features such as [[Social interactions|chat and invitation blocking]]. It was stated to take place early 2021 and to be mandatory in order to continue being able to log in and play the game. Additionally, it was announced that players who completed the migration would receive a [[cape]] as a reward.

The official FAQ stated that the migration would roll out gradually, with each phase including only a limited number of eligible players that would be notified on their Minecraft.net profile pages as well as through the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]''.

=== Introduction of Microsoft accounts ===
On November 27, 2020, the launcher was updated to version [[Launcher 2.2.74x|2.2.74]], introducing support for Microsoft accounts.

On December 1, 2020, the creation of new Mojang accounts was discontinued, and all new copies of {{JE}} from that date onward required a Microsoft account.<ref>{{tweet|MojangSupport|1333771918797918208|Purchasing for Minecraft Java Edition is restored. You will know need to create a Microsoft account for new purchases of this version - JP|December 1, 2021}}</ref>

On February 28, 2021, the FAQ was edited to confirm that third-party launchers can now support Microsoft accounts.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228190711/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360050865492|title=Minecraft Java Account Migration FAQ - Home|website=Minecraft.net|date=February 28, 2021}}</ref>

=== Pre-migration ===
On December 2020, the [https://minecraft.net/mojang-account-move minecraft.net/mojang-account-move] page and its redirect [https://minecraft.net/move minecraft.net/move] were created.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210703225521/https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/mojang-account-move|title=Mojang Java Account Move &vert; Minecraft|website=Minecraft.net|date=December 5, 2020}}</ref>

On February 19, 2021, a new YouTube video promoting the migration process was released. The video was initially unlisted and only included on Minecraft.net.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210826094300/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpF8AaPyqhQ|title=Java Account Move: A Fun Visit from Dinnerbone|website=youtube.com|date=February 19, 2021}}</ref> The video was made public on November 24, 2021.<ref>{{ytl|PpF8AaPyqhQ|Java Account Move: A Fun Visit from Dinnerbone|Minecraft|November 24, 2021}}</ref>

=== Migration ===
Starting June 24, 2021, players were able to migrate. Players eligible for migration received a notification on the ''Minecraft Launcher'' leading to their Minecraft.net profile page. Once on their Minecraft.net profile page, players had to:
# Click on "Move my account"
# Verify their email used by their Mojang account
# Create ''or'' connect to a Microsoft account
# Click on "Complete the move"

On February 4, 2022, it was announced that players who did not migrate would be unable to play {{JE}} starting March 10, 2022.<ref>{{mcnet|last-call-voluntarily-migrate-java-accounts|Last call to voluntarily migrate Java accounts|February 4, 2022}}</ref> Mojang accounts were blocked gradually, with only 1% of remaining Mojang accounts being restricted on March 10.<ref>{{tweet|Mojang_Ined|1501909584008597506|Beside the allay entering beta, we have another major milestone. Starting today, we have begun shutting our door for Mojang accounts. You will need to migrate to a Microsoft account before playing. We start with 1% of our accounts and increase gradually http://minecraft.net/move|March 10, 2022}}</ref>

On May 8, 2023, it was announced that the migration deadline would be September 19, 2023. After this date, unmigrated accounts would no longer be able to sign in to Minecraft.net or the ''Minecraft Launcher'', therefore making migration impossible. Additionally, it was stated that beginning September 5, 2023, Mojang's support would no longer assist with migration-related issues.<ref>{{mcnet|account-migration-last-call|Mojang Account migration completed|May 8, 2023}}</ref>

The migration period ended on September 19, 2023, as announced.

=== Post-migration ===
On September 19, 2023, a post-migration period was opened. This gave players who did not migrate one last chance to retain access to the game by going through a post-migration process. However, this process did not actually involve migrating accounts; instead, it simply granted players who had missed the deadline the chance to obtain an entirely new account free of charge. Apart from being free, these new accounts were identical to new ones purchased normally; they did not retain the Java profile name, capes, or server progress of the original accounts. In addition, as these accounts were never actually migrated, they were not eligible for the [[migrator cape]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230919160438/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/19615552270221|title=Post-Migration Process FAQ &vert; Minecraft Help|website=help.minecraft.net|date=September 19, 2023}}</ref> The post-migration period ended on December 18, 2023, as announced.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223151330/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/19615552270221|title=Post-Migration Process FAQ &vert; Minecraft Help|website=help.minecraft.net|date=December 23, 2023}}</ref>

On March 10, 2024, Mojang deleted some unmigrated accounts.<ref>{{ytl|PZUc5PUwLk8|Minecraft Accounts Are Being Secretly Deleted|xinabox|March 10, 2024}}</ref> Originally, the FAQ page mentioned that the usernames of deleted accounts would be released at some point.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231019040342/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/19633473939981|title=I Missed my Chance to Migrate. What Happens to my Account? &vert; Minecraft Help|website=help.minecraft.net|date=October 19, 2023}}</ref> However, this was later changed to say that such usernames "may or may not be available".<ref>https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/19633473939981-Information-about-Mojang-Accounts-and-Microsoft-Account-Migration</ref> This remains on the current version of the page, leaving it unknown if any more usernames will be released.

== Community discoveries ==
=== Alternative migration timelines ===
On January 29, 2021, a file named <samp>accountMigration.json</samp> was discovered on Mojang's website. Its contents was speculated to be a detailed migration timeline:<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210130214402/https://launchercontent.mojang.com/accountMigration.json|title=accountMigration.json|website=launchercontent.mojang.com|date=January 29, 2021}}</ref>

</syntaxhighlight>

According to the file, migration would begin on April 12, 2021, become mandatory for playing ''Minecraft'' starting May 12, 2022, and conclude on July 5, 2022.

However, on February 1, 2021, the file was updated with placeholder dates:<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210201094158/https://launchercontent.mojang.com/accountMigration.json|title=accountMigration.json|website=launchercontent.mojang.com|date=February 1, 2021}}</ref>

Mojang did not comment on the discovery until April 12, 2022 to confirm that the migration would not begin that day.<ref>{{tweet|Mojang_Ined|1381669725097357317|Unlike what some sites might have announced, Mojang Account migration will not start today.|April 12, 2022}}</ref> An internal migration however did happen on the week of April 12.<ref name="internalmigration"/>

=== Veteran capes ===

[[File:Veteran cape screenshot.png|thumb|The screenshot used in the "Migration Eligibility Email" help page.]]
[[File:Veteran cape Dinnerbone's clip.mp4|thumb|The clip of Dinnerbone being asked about veteran capes.]]

On October 21, 2020, when the migration was first announced, the [[Minecraft.net]] article alluded to the possibility of multiple capes being given out:<ref name="movinghouse"/>

{{Q|And who knows? You might even have more than one outfit to show off – but we’ll tell you more about that later down the road.}}

{{Q|[...] you'll get an opportunity to participate and receive your cape! Or is that capes? Hmm.}}

{{Q|And... a special Veteran cape for each year you’ve played Java Edition!}}

On June 9, 2021, this text appeared in a screenshot used in the "Migration Eligibility Email" help page.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210907014539/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4406954699533-Migration-Eligibility-Email|title=Migration Eligibility Email - Home|website=help.minecraft.net|date=September 7, 2021}}</ref> The same text appeared on player's profile pages on Minecraft.net for a short time after being removed.{{cn}}

On September 2021, while streaming on Twitch, [[Dinnerbone]] was asked about veteran capes:<ref>{{reddit|po7g6g|dinnerbone_confirms_veteran_capes|Dinnerbone Confirms Veteran Capes|Munown|September 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|DangerXcom|1437891809804496899|@ibxtoycat i’m sure you probably heard of the veteran cape leaks before, so here’s an interesting clip from one of @Dinnerbone’s streams: https://m.twitch.tv/dinnerbone/clip/InnocentExuberantHorseradishThunBeast-Ze-wwavrO_rJ0qHn|September 14, 2021}}</ref>

{{Q|"Are veteran capes real?" As far as I know yes, I've seen a few of them.}}

On February 25, 2022, Ined, a Mojang employee working on Mojang accounts and their migration, acknowledged the discovery while stating that veteran capes were "a lie":<ref>{{tweet|Mojang_Ined|1497147143471075329|Fun fact Friday! The cake is a lie - so are veteran capes|February 25, 2022}}</ref>

{{Q|Fun fact Friday! {{w|The cake is a lie}} - so are veteran capes}}

On May 18, 2025, [[Marc Watson]] explained that veteran capes were scrapped due to Mojang being unable to make it "fair and accurate for every player across platforms".<ref>{{bluesky|marc-irl.bsky.social|3loosi7bfzk2x|I’ve always been told that there wasn’t a way to do this that was fair and accurate for every player across platforms.
