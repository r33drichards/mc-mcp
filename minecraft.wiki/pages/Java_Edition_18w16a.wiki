'''18w16a''' is the thirty-second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on April 19, 2018<ref>{{snap|18w16a|April 18, 2018}}</ref>, which added the [[Buffet]] world type.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[World type]]s'''
* [[Buffet]]
** Creates single-biome worlds.
** Allows choosing between [[Overworld]] and [[The End|End]] terrain generation.
** Another way to generate chunks (checkerboard) is available by [[NBT format#Software|using an NBT Editor]] to open a Buffet world's [[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]], and using the following code for <code>"generatorOptions"</code>:<syntaxhighlight inline lang="json">{"biome_source":{"type":"minecraft:checkerboard","biomes":[]},"chunk_generator":{"type":""}}</syntaxhighlight>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Coral fan]]s'''
* Now generate in [[coral reef]]s, on the sides of [[coral block]]s.

'''[[Blue ice]]'''
* Is now slightly less slippery.

'''[[Coral block]]s'''
* Now require [[Silk Touch]] to drop as items when mined, otherwise they drop dead coral blocks.
* No longer instantly turn into dead coral when on land.

'''[[Conduit]]'''
* Particles are now blue instead of orange.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Drowned]]'''
* Can now spawn extra in [[underwater ruins]], besides their regular spawning in the oceans.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Water]]'''
* When water spreads and would later turn into a source block, it now immediately just places a source block instead of flowing into the block first.
** This means that water can now also spread into waterloggable blocks.

'''[[Water Breathing]]'''
* When given from [[turtle shell]]s, it no longer shows particles.

=== General ===
'''Optimizations'''
* Optimized world spawn position–finding code.

'''Block and item tags'''
* New <code>valid_spawn</code> block tag for blocks that the player can spawn on.
* New block and item tags for coral.

'''[[Tick]]s'''
* There is now a distinction between scheduled "liquid ticks" and "block ticks".

'''[[Biome]]s'''
* Changed how the temperature of ocean biomes is calculated; should result in nicer transitions between oceans.
* Biome names are now translatable.
* Updated some biome names:
