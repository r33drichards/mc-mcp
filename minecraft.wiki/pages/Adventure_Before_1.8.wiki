{| class="wikitable" data-description="Unbreakable but still removable blocks"
! Block
! Method
|-
| {{BlockLink|Cactus}}
| Cannot be destroyed directly but can be removed by placing a block next to it, or by removing the sand below it.
|-
| {{BlockLink|Cake}}
| Cannot be destroyed directly but can be removed by eating, or by removing the block below it.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Fire}}
| Extinguished with the tool used for the block the player is aiming at behind the actual fire and will not degrade the tool unless the target block is broken. However, if the player has one handy, dousing the fire with a [[water bucket]] works just as well.
|-
| {{BlockLink|TNT}}
| Cannot be destroyed directly but can be detonated. The player should exercise caution if valuable items are nearby.
|}

== Unbreakable ==

These blocks cannot be broken, no matter what tool is used. They still may be broken using explosions if the blast resistance is low enough.
