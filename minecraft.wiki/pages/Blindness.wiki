'''Blindness''' is a [[status effect]] that impairs a [[player]]'s vision and prevents [[sprinting]] and [[critical hit]]s. It has no [[potion]], but it can be obtained by consuming [[suspicious stew]] made with an [[azure bluet]] or [[open eyeblossom]].

== Effect ==
{{See also|Fog#Blindness and darkness}}
[[File:Blindness View.png|thumb|right|The view from a player who is afflicted by blindness.]]
Blindness impairs a player's vision as if a thick black [[fog]] was surrounding them, with only the immediate area around them being visible.

The effect also prevents the player from [[sprinting]] or inflicting [[critical hits]]. However, {{in|be}}, it does not stop an ongoing sprint.

The effect can be removed by drinking [[milk]]. {{IN|education|bedrock}} when education options are enabled, drinking [[eye drops]] also removes blindness.

Blindness has no effect on [[mob]]s. This can be observed in [[Survival]] by having a [[fox]] eat suspicious stew made with an azure bluet.

[[Warden]]s are naturally blind and instead rely on detection via [[vibration]]s, smell and touch. This form of blindness is completely independent from the Blindness effect.
