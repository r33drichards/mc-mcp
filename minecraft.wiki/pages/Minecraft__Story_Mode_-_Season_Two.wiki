== Episodes ==
The game is divided into five separately sold episodes, released in intervals of 1 to 2 months. Similar to the previous season, a [[MCSM:Season Pass (Season Two)|Season Pass]], which bundled all five episodes together and a physical copy subtitled ''Season Pass Disc'' were released as well.

That physical release includes the first episode on the disc and granted access to the other four episodes via download when the game's servers were operating. The physical and digital release on {{w|Nintendo Switch}} forms an exception, as it contains all five episodes on the cartridge / included without requiring a download.

== Quotes ==
{{q|If you’re not familiar with Story Mode, it’s a sort of Choose Your Own Adventure set in the Minecraft universe, full of high drama, plucky underdogs, legendary heroes, dastardly villains, incredible peril and perky pigs. Logically enough, Season 2 follows on from Season 1, with players once again filling Jesse’s cuboid shoes, and with a host of familiar faces in tow - but new players should be able to jump right on board!|[[Marsh Davies]]<ref name=Trailer/>||Marsh Davies Mojang avatar.png}}
