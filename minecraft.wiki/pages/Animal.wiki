[[File:animals_preview.png|260px|right|thumb|Some of the many animals from {{MC}}.]]
'''Animal''' refers to a category of [[mob]]s that are mainly based on real-life animals. Many other mobs and even some [[block]]s are also based on real life animals, but are not treated as such in ''Minecraft''. Most of these mobs are also called animals in many [[advancements]].

Animals are usually either [[Mob#Passive mobs|passive]] (fleeing) or [[Mob#Neutral mobs|neutral]] (fighting), with the only exceptions being the [[Undead|undead mounts]] while ridden, [[hoglin]]s and [[killer bunnies]]{{only|java|short=1}}, which are [[Mob#Hostile mobs|hostile mobs]].

== Properties ==
Mobs mentioned on this page share the following properties:
* They are classified as {{cd|Animal}} or {{cd|Water Animal}} in the game code.
* Most of them can [[breeding|breed]].
* Most follow the player if they are holding the item used to breed them.
* Most of them trigger the "The Parrots and The Bats" and "Two By Two" [[advancement]] when breed.
Several animal mobs can be [[Lead#Leashing mobs|leashed]] although this doesn't affect their classification. Animal mobs can also spawn in the [[Peaceful]] difficulty, with the exception of the undead mounts.

These mobs were referred to as animals in different areas of the game, but not in the [[entity format]]:
* {{EntityLink|Allay}}{{note|Allays are referred to as animals in [[achievement]]s ("Zoology" category), as well as [[advancement]]s ("Husbandry" category).}}
* {{EntityLink|Bat}}{{note|Bats are under the wild animals section in the [[spawn egg]]s tab in the [[creative inventory]]. The name of the advancement, "[[The Parrots and the Bats]]," ironically points out that these two mobs are among the only animals that do not breed.}}

Some mobs like [[copper golem]]s, [[iron golem]]s, and [[snow golem]]s are internally referred to as animals,<ref>{{cd|net/minecraft/world/entity/animal}}</ref> although this does not affect the entity format, as these mobs do not share all of the same traits as actual in-game animals.

== Related mobs ==
These mobs are based on real life animals, but are not treated as such in the game code - rather as {{cd|Monster}} only.
* {{EntityLink|Cave Spider}}
* {{EntityLink|Endermite}}
* {{EntityLink|Silverfish}}
* {{EntityLink|Spider}}

Despite being classified as only [[monster]]s in-game, [[guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s were referred to as "animals of the deep" in a ''Minecraft'' video about them.<ref>{{ytl|gs-rMm5luB8|Why are their eyes so big? <nowiki>|</nowiki> The Story Of The Elder Guardian|Minecraft|August 24, 2025|t=56s}}</ref>

==Related blocks==
These blocks are based on real life/fantasy animals, but are not treated as such in the game code, due to being blocks.
* {{BlockLink|Coral}}

* {{BlockLink|Dried Ghast}}
* [[File:Invicon Firefly Bush.png|16px]] [[Firefly Bush]]

== Trivia ==
* In its [[Mob Menagerie]], [[shulker]]s were implied to be molluscs, a group of real-life invertebrate animals that include squid, glow squid, and nautiluses, given the nature of their shells.<ref>[https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/shulker Mob Menagerie: Shulker]</ref>
