The following is a list of '''versions that are not included in the [[Java Edition launcher|launcher]]'''. If a version is labeled as edited, it means that the META-INF files in the jar are dated differently from the release date. This is because these versions were recompiled from existing source code and their compiled files use newer dates. Versions labeled as edited are currently in the launcher; if a version is listed but not labeled as edited, it is not available in the launcher.

== [[Server]] ==
Even though the newest [[Java Edition launcher]] includes an option to download a version's cross-platform server .jar file (whether it be for [[Java Edition|release]] or a [[Development versions|development version]]), this does not apply to all versions. The official [[Minecraft]] server program started to be developed when Multiplayer Test was released to the public ([[Classic 0.0.15a (Multiplayer Test 1)|0.0.15a (Multiplayer Test 1)]]). After Classic [[Classic 0.30 (Creative)|0.30 (Creative)]] was released, servers were removed from the game, which is why multiplayer is not available in [[Indev]] and [[Infdev]] versions of the game. Servers were reintroduced to the game when [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.15|Alpha v1.0.15]] was released (however, versions as early as [[Java Edition Alpha v1.0.5|Alpha v1.0.5]] had multiplayer code in them, though it was unusable, except to [[Markus Persson|Notch]], who used the code to test multiplayer), and they have been consistently updated since. There are programs available that allow connection to [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]], [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]], and [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]] servers. 

The oldest server version that the launcher allows the player to download is [[Java Edition 1.2.5|release 1.2.5]].

== ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' ==
The ''Minecraft Launcher'' was released during [[Alpha v1.0]]'s development. This launcher could not update itself, and each time a new update was released for the launcher, a player would have to download it from minecraft.net. This launcher was developed from 2010 to 2013, and is still available to be downloaded from archived versions of its page. It is not known how many versions of this launcher existed. 

During the [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]] snapshots, a new launcher was released. This launcher was built to update itself, and the player could now have the launcher window and the game window open at the same time. The player could also switch what version they were playing without having to replace [[minecraft.jar]] in the bin directory. This launcher was developed from 2013 to 2018, whether or not it can still be downloaded is not known. The latest version is 1.6.91.

The latest ''Minecraft Launcher'' was made available to the public by [[Nathan Adams|Dinnerbone]] on October 26, 2016, through a twitter statement and a post on the [https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft Minecraft Reddit community]. This launcher no longer required java to be installed to run it, downloaded its own runtime for the game, and had more advanced features compared to other versions of the launcher. This launcher has been under steady development since 2016, and the current stable release of this launcher is {{v|launcher-win}} for Windows 7+, {{v|launcher-win-new}} for Windows 10+ (Microsoft Store/Xbox app), {{v|launcher-mac}} for macOS, and {{v|launcher-lin}} for Linux.
