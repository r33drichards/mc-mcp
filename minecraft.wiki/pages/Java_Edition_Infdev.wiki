'''Infdev''' (short for <u>inf</u>inite <u>dev</u>elopment)<ref name=":0">{{tweet|notch|1372513921404387329|The way I remember it, it was the name of the branch I set up to test out infinite terrain size.

It was only playable in singleplayer [[Survival]] mode, and was the third ''Minecraft'' development stage to have some of its versions released to the public.

Infdev succeeded [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]] when [[Notch]] decided to rewrite the game's code to allow terrain to be "infinite" and procedurally generated rather than finite. This principle of how maps are generated is similar to current ''Minecraft'' maps. Ever since Infdev, maps generate terrain theoretically 8 times the size of the Earth. Infdev was also the first appearance of the [[Far Lands]]. The edge of the map limits the world to 64,000,000 blocks by 64,000,000 blocks, or 4.096 billion square kilometers. For comparison, the Earth has a total surface area (including ocean) of 510 million square kilometers.

* Giant [[brick pyramid]]s spawn throughout the world in early versions of Infdev. The locations of the pyramids is predetermined, and was always the same regardless of the [[world seed]], surrounding terrain, or game version. These pyramids reached from near the top of the world down to the ground. The base of the pyramid does not replace normally generated terrain except for water and air. 14 minutes after brick pyramids were added, a quick update was released that fixed a bug where the structures would assume the world height was still 256 blocks, generate as such, and then get cut off by the lowered world height of 128 blocks. It is a completely solid structure, with no interior rooms.
* Infdev also includes the first appearance of the [[Far Lands/Java Edition|Far Lands]] and the first legitimately observable distance effects. The Far Lands are not exclusive to Infdev; in fact, the phenomena of the giant distortion wall at ±12,550,820 and beyond would persist into the late Beta versions of the game, being finally removed in [[Java Edition Beta 1.8|Beta 1.8]]. After the removal of the well-known feature which was the most common use of the term, it's since been re-used to describe the far areas of the map and their strange, shaky physics, as well as the end of the map at ±32 million. The position of the Far Lands changed twice in this version. Between February 27 and March 25, the Far Lands generated at ±33,554,432 and were just a giant solid wall of stone that went from sea level to the height limit, as well the end of the map was at ±16,777,216 and not ±32 million. On the March 27th release, the level generator updated from the Indev generator to the Alpha generator and the Far Lands as we know them came to be.
* "Infinite" map generation

* [[Sign]]s, [[ladder]]s, and [[door]]s
* [[Minecart]]s and their [[rail]]s (powered, detector and activator rails were introduced later)
* [[Monster room]]s
* [[Golden apple]]s
* Wood and cobblestone [[stairs]]
* [[Saddle]]s
*[[Obsidian Wall]]s

== Phases of Infdev ==
Infdev can be conceptually split into three conceptual phases, based on how the game was being updated at the different times. Note that these phases are not official, and are only present for convenience at explaining the updates to Infdev.

#The first phase of Infdev lasted from February 27, 2010, through to March 25, 2010. This phase of Infdev was mostly for testing purposes, seeing as the player spawned with stacks of certain items in their inventory. Test structures, such as brick pyramids and [[obsidian wall]]s, would generate throughout the world. This phase of the game brought all of Indev's features up to par with Infdev's infinite terrain. 
# The second phase started on March 27, 2010, and went until April 20, 2010. This phase of the game introduced the new [[Alpha level format]] and the ability to save up to 5 worlds in the client. The terrain generator changed many times throughout this phase.
# After a hiatus of over a month, the third phase started on June 7, 2010, and ended on June 30, 2010. Since all of [[Java Edition Indev|Indev]]'s features had been caught up to Infdev's infinite terrain, this phase mostly added new features, such as doors, signs, ladders and stairs. This phase also introduced [[Seecret Updates]], which added features such as [[minecart]]s and [[rail]]s, and [[Monster Room|dungeon]]s and [[Monster Spawner|spawner]]s. On June 29, 2010, Notch started to develop the offline client of the game, which no longer required the [[player]] to use a browser to play ''Minecraft''. These versions were the transition into [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]].

== Alpha replacing Infdev ==
Because Infdev's main purpose was to catch an infinite terrain version up to par with Indev's content, that purpose was filled around June 2010. Infdev was replaced by the name of [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] as a sign of progression towards release. Infdev no longer gets updated, and its link has been removed from the Minecraft website.

Infdev, along with [[Indev]], were still available on Minecraft.net up until September 2010, and to play Infdev now, players must use the option for playing another version of the game in the new launcher.

Alpha's transition was an arguably "gradual" one, as the version [[Alpha v1.0.0]] was originally an Infdev version, which was only retroactively defined as being Alpha v1.0.0 upon the release of [[Alpha v1.0.1]].

== Trivia ==
* Infdev was given its name as a play on words from Indev (which stood for <u>in dev</u>elopment); the "Inf" stands for "Infinite".<ref name=":0" />
* Infdev is silent since the Infdev resources have been removed from minecraft.net/resources (unless the user uses a proxy for the resources), but this does not happen to Indev.
* Breaking a [[block]] when directly on top of it would not show the breaking animation in Infdev.
* In early versions of Infdev, the [[player]] would start with 990 [[wood planks]] and 999 [[glass]] blocks.
* In the terrain.png (the file with all of the textures), two identical textures for [[gear]]s could be seen. These would be replaced by the animated textures for clockwise and counter-clockwise gears in-game. The actual gear textures (which the animation is based on) were located in the <code>misc</code> folder, under the names <code>gear.png</code> and <code>gearmiddle.png</code>.
* In the same file, a strange and out of place texture could be seen below the [[sapling]], which appeared to be a jumble of red, orange, and white pixels. However, it was later replaced with a solid red square, with the words "FIRE TEX! HNST" written on it. This texture is replaced with the animated fire texture in-game.
* There is a rumor that in the files, an unused level type called the "Skylands" could be found, which might've been a new file type for Indev (possibly the Floating world type).{{more info needed|Does this actually exist? The fact it's referred to as a "rumor" doesn't give me much confidence.}}
* From the February 27 to April 15, 2010 Infdev versions, mobs did not spawn due to a bug in the code. The April 15 version fixed this.
* Although only one version of Infdev is available through the launcher, all except three of the infdev versions of the game have been archived in their unmodified states on third party websites.
* If the player tries to play the first 4 versions of Infdev today (except [[Java Edition Infdev 20100227-1414]], which is currently lost) without proxy or modifications, they may be kicked back to the main menu, or the game might crash with a <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code> error.
* The only Infdev version that can be found in the [[launcher]] upon enabling historical versions is [[Java Edition Infdev 20100618]].
* 3 of the Infdev versions made are lost.
