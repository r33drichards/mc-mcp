'''Smooth red sandstone''' is a variant of [[red sandstone]], obtained by smelting.

=== Breaking ===
Smooth red sandstone can be mined with any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, the [[block]] drops nothing.

Despite regular red sandstone having hardness and blast resistances of 0.8, smooth red sandstone has a blast resistance of 6 and hardness of 2. This is likely due to historical reasons, specifically as a result of hardness being inherited from slab blocks,<ref>{{bug|MC-53641}}</ref> however the "correct"/"expected" values were changed to the "incorrect" values {{in|BE}}.<ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/27935763028237</ref>

=== Data history ===
==== ''Java Edition'' ====
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8|dev=14w32a|Smooth red sandstone exists as a metadata variant of the secondary double slab block (block ID 181): if such a block had a metadata value of 8, it would use the top texture on all six sides. This logic continued from the primary double slab block (ID 43).
|Smooth sandstone existed as block 181, metadata 8.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.13|dev=17w47a|The different <code>type</code> block states for the <code>double_stone_slab2</code> ID have been split up into their own IDs.
