A special preview version of '''[[Java Edition 2.0]]''' was privately given to several YouTubers to be able to record videos before April Fools Day 2013.

== Differences from the full release ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{blockLink|Torch (Burnt-out)}}'''
* Does not have a tooltip.

=== Mobs ===
'''Horse'''
* Reverts back to a regular cow after a relog.

'''[[Pig]]s, [[mooshroom]]s, [[cow]]s, [[sheep]] and [[chicken]]s'''
* Explosion done by overfeeding creates ghost items that cannot be picked up, along with real items.

'''[[Pink wither]]'''
* Tag <code>Heads</code> does not get saved, which makes additional heads revert back to one head after a relog.

'''[[Sheep]]'''
* Does not explode when going above Y=1000.

=== General ===
* A regular splash is always displayed regardless of whether the "{{Font color|#fb00fb|APRIL FOOLS!}}" splash is activated.
* Speech bubbles have not been implemented yet.</onlyinclude>
