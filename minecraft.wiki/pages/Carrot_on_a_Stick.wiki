A '''carrot on a stick''' is a [[tool]] that can be used to control saddled [[pig]]s.

== Usage ==
=== Riding a pig ===
To use a carrot on a stick, the player must first [[saddle]] a [[pig]], and ride it while holding the carrot on a stick. The pig then moves in the direction of the carrot. Also, if the player holds a carrot on a stick, all nearby pigs (but not [[rabbit]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-207993||Rabbits don't follow players holding carrots on sticks}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-219913||Rabbits don't follow players holding carrots on sticks}}</ref>) follow the player, but they can't breed using a carrot on a stick.

To make the pig run faster, the player can press {{control|use}} while holding the carrot on a stick. This is called "boosting". Each boost costs 7 durability {{in|java}}, or 2 durability {{in|bedrock}}. If the carrot on a stick's durability is depleted, it turns back into a [[fishing rod]]. 

The speed of a mounted pig is 2.42&nbsp;m/s. Boosting a pig causes its speed to slowly ramp up until it reaches 2.15 times its normal speed, 5.20&nbsp;m/s. Then speed slowly declines until the pig reaches normal speed again. The boost lasts between 140 and 980 game [[tick]]s (7 seconds and 49 seconds respectively), chosen randomly. No matter how many ticks the boost lasts, the average speed of pig during a full boost cycle is roughly 4.19&nbsp;m/s. These boosted speeds are applied only while holding the carrot on a stick. These speeds are affected by the [[speed]] effect.
