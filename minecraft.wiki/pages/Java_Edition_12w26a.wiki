'''12w26a''' is the thirteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], released on June 27, 2012.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120627153147/https://www.mojang.com/2012/06/the-weekly-chunk-office-snapshot/</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Monster_Spawner_JE2.png|36px]] '''[[Monster spawner]]s'''
* Now support extra information for the mobs it spawns. This allows unmodified games to have spawners for special variants of mobs, the player still requires external or modified means to set these parameters, though.
** Examples: [[charged creeper]]s, [[endermen]] holding specific blocks, green robe [[villager]]s, villagers with custom trade offers.

[[File:TNT_JE2_BE1.png|36px]] '''[[TNT]]'''
* No longer drops as an item when broken in [[Creative]] mode.

* Monsters can now spawn on upside down slabs.

{{Animate|Piston_(U)_JE2_BE1.png;Sticky_Piston_(U)_JE1.png|36px}} '''[[Piston]]s'''
* Normal and [[sticky pistons]] now schedule extensions and retractions rather than executing them as soon as they are updated.

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Silverfish JE1 BE1.gif|48px]] '''[[Silverfish]]'''
* If under the Poison effect, they spawn silverfish from nearby [[monster egg]]s more quickly.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Performance'''
* Performance improvements.

== Fixes ==
'''11 bugs fixed'''
* Spruce, birch and jungle [[wooden stairs]] can now be crafted.
* Removed sand and gravel duplication glitch.
* In creative mode, destroying a TNT block no longer drops a TNT block.
* Fixed changing the name of a world, loading that world, saving and quitting it undoing the world rename.
* Fixed game crashing when it automatically selects the "Scanning for LAN Worlds" item in the server list and user deletes it.
* Fixed arrow representing the player on the map item not pointing in the right direction.
* Fixed clicking "Save and Quit" or "Disconnect" twice quickly crashing the game.
* Fixed the multiplayer server fairly regularly dropping all players and showing many <code>NullPointerExceptions</code> in the console every few hours.
* Fixed save files being closed each time world was auto-saved.
* Fixed placing a piston in front of another which is powered, but not extended, causing the placed piston to become a "[[weird piston]]" and have the metadata value 7.
* Removed powered rail duplication glitch.</onlyinclude>

== Bugs ==
* [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-177|"MC-117"] Piston head turns invisible when rapidly extending and retracting
