'''''Minecraft: The Survivors' Book of Secrets''''' is a miniature ''[[Minecraft]]'' guidebook authored by [[Mojang Studios]] that tries to explain game mechanics through the lens of a hand-inked journal.

== Synopsis ==
{{Quote|An all-new official Minecraft™ guidebook full of tips to fend off mobs and withstand the wild!

This official Minecraft™ book contains the collective knowledge of the Survivors: an underground group of Minecraft™ experts who have been around since the days of Alpha.
 
You’re probably wondering why you’ve never heard of us. It’s because we’re THAT good. We’re experts at covert ops. Misdirection is our middle name. We’re invisible up until the exact moment we want you to see us. . . . Our successes are undeniably impressive: we’ve battled the Overworld mobs, dealt with enemy factions and defeated the ender dragon multiple times.
 
Study this book carefully and you just might manage to stay alive as long as we have.
 
THE CHIEF}}

== Contents ==

{{Quote|A beacon is the most expensive investment you're ever likely to make, but the benefits of having one in your base are enormous. When mounted on a pyramid it provides a powerful light source that can be seen from afar, as well as a range of beneficial status effects when you're in the vicinity.

== Trivia ==

* Each chapter is accented with a Latin phrase, with a minuscule caption translating the terminology into English.
** ''Briefing'' has ''SEMPER PARATUS'', meaning "always prepared".
** ''Combat on the Home Front'' has ''SI VIS PACEM PARA BELLUM'', meaning "if you want peace, prepare for war".
** ''Combat in the Field'' has ''VENIMUS VIDIMUS VICIMUS'', meaning "we came, we saw, we conquered".
** Debriefing has ''VERBA VOLANT SCRIPTA MANENT'', meaning "spoken words fly away, written words remain".
*A running gag throughout the book is that [[helmet]]s are used to convey emotions on faceless figures, with their brims being used akin to eyebrows.
*During the foreword, the phrase "a block and a hard place" is used, as a pun on the common saying "stuck between a ''rock'' and a hard place". This same phrase would later become the name of an [[Story Mode:A Block and a Hard Place|episode]] of {{MCSM}}.
*The book appears in ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode - Season Two]]'' as one of the books in {{MCSM|Fred}}'s house.<ref name=mcsm />
**The [[MCSM:The Survivors' Book of Secrets|book in the game]] avoided mentioning the terms "Minecraft" and "[[Alpha]]".
