A version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''March 20, 2010'''.<ref name="update">[[wordofnotch:461651626|Infdev update: trees and furnaces]] – The Word of Notch, March 20, 2010</ref>

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Oak JE5.png|32px]] [[Tree]]s'''
* Have been re-implemented and now generate naturally.

'''[[Ore]]s'''
* Have been re-implemented and now generate naturally.
** Ignore height, allowing for any ore to generate on cliffs.
** Spawn only in blobs of one.
** Rarity seems to be implemented; [[coal ore]] is very common, [[iron ore]] and [[gold ore]] are somewhat common (and they seem to be the same rarity), and [[diamond ore]] is rare.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
''' General '''
* Furnaces and chests now "remember" the items put into them if replaced in the same location.

== Fixes ==
'''4 bug fixed'''
* [[Fire]] can now be extinguished by punching.
* Opening containers (i.e. [[chest]]s and [[furnace]]s) no longer crashes the game.
* [[Creeper]]s and [[TNT]] now explode.
* Fixes most other crash bugs in previous Infdev versions.<ref name="update"/>{{info needed|too vague - should be replaced with examples}}
