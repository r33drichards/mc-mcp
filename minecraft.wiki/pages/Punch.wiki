'''Punch''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[bow]]s that increases arrow [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]].

== Obtaining ==
Punch can be obtained from [[enchanting tables]], drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]],{{only|bedrock}} books obtained by [[fishing]], [[monster room]] chests, librarian [[villager]]s, and non-village [[structure]] loot.

Punch I bows can be obtained by [[Trading#Librarian|trading]] with an expert [[Fletcher]].

[[Skeleton]]s may spawn with a Punch I bow on Normal or Hard difficulty.

== Usage ==
Punch increases horizontal projectile knockback by 3.3 blocks for the first level and 3.507 blocks more for the second level. The base knockback of projectiles without the enchantment is 1.985 blocks, causing a Punch II projectile to deal 8.792 blocks of knockback.{{info needed|There is no more suitable inline template. Please don't change or revert until the Talk page discussion is resolved}} Punch also increases vertical projectile knockback from 0.8125 blocks to 1.25 blocks, regardless of the level of enchantment.

If a Punch II [[arrow]] is blocked by a [[shield]], the knockback effect doesn't apply in {{JE}} but does in {{BE}}. By use of commands to increase the level of enchantment beyond II, the enchantment's effect caps at level 255.

=== Specific cases ===
If Punch is applied to a [[crossbow]] by use of [[command]]s or an [[anvil]] in Creative, the enchantment functions when firing [[arrow]]s but not when firing [[firework rocket]]s. If Punch is applied to a [[trident]] by use of commands or an anvil in Creative, the enchantment does not function.

== Trivia ==
* Before [[firework rockets]] were given the ability to propel the [[elytra]] in [[16w50a]], a [[bow]] with the Punch enchantment was used to shoot the [[player]] mid-flight, so as to provide forward momentum and gain [[altitude]].
