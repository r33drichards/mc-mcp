'''25w37a''' is the ninth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.9]], released on September 9, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w37a|id=a|September 9, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Game rule]]s'''
* Added <code>spawnerBlocksEnabled</code> game rule controlling if [[spawner]] blocks should be enabled or not.
** Default to <code>true</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Test instance block]]'''
* Test instance blocks now preserve error markers between world reloads.

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Logic for choosing type of equipment for [[geared mobs]] has been tweaked to add [[copper]] as a possibility.
** The initial roll to choose a type now chooses between [[leather]], [[copper]] and [[gold]].
** The chance to increase an armor tier has increased from 9.5% to 10.87%.

[[File:Copper Golem JE1 BE1.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Copper golem]]'''
* The hitbox has been tweaked.
** The hitbox is now 0.49 blocks in width to be able to pathfind through narrow spaces.
* Can now open [[door]]s.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|87.0}}.

'''[[Debug property|Debug features]]'''
* Some debug features that were previously removed during compilation are now preserved and can be used by players.
* Individual values can be enabled with JVM properties:
** First, a global debug flag must be enabled with {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED}} or {{cd|1=-DMC_DEBUG_ENABLED=true}}.
** Then, a specific feature can be enabled, for example {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN}} or {{cd|1=-DMC_DEBUG_BRAIN=true}}.
** To get the list of all available debug properties, add {{cd|-DMC_DEBUG_PRINT_PROPERTIES}}.
* Warning: this is debug code. It must be handled with extreme care.
** This is an advanced feature, meant to help modders - it should not be used for normal play.
** Features not guaranteed to work as intended.
** It might crash the player's game or corrupt their worlds.
** Individual options might be added, changed or removed without a notice.

'''Game library updates'''
* Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.3 core profile.

'''[[Game mode switcher]]'''
* Switching from [[Spectator mode]] to [[Creative mode]] no longer causes the player to stop flying.
** Instead, flight now only gets disabled when switching game modes if the player is near the ground.
*** A player is considered to be near the ground if there is a collidable surface (i.e. blocks, [[happy ghast]]s, [[boat]]s...) within 1 block below them.
** Flight will not get disabled if the player was inside a block or collidable entity.
*** This is to prevent players from suddenly falling through the ground.

'''[[Game rule]]s'''
*<code>enableCommandBlocks</code> was renamed to <code>commandBlocksEnabled</code>, to match ''Bedrock Edition''.

'''[[Light]]'''
* Ambient lighting on entities has been adjusted to be more visually in line with blocks and other parts of the game.
** The underside of flat surfaces will now be lit from that direction, instead of the opposite direction.
** This mainly affects models containing cubes that are either flat or "hollow" such as: worn [[armor]], worn [[elytra]], the outside layers on player skins, the ribcages of [[skeleton]]s or [[skeleton horse]]s, the feet of [[chicken]]s or [[frog]]s, the wings of [[phantom]]s or the [[ender dragon]], the fins on [[fish]], and more.

'''[[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]]'''
* Clients must authenticate to access the API.
** Clients should supply an Authorization bearer token header with a server specific secret.
** The secret is configured in the server properties file:
*** <code>management-server-secret=</code>
*** The secret should be exactly 40 alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
*** The secret will be automatically generated if the server property is empty.
*** Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 Unauthorized.
* TLS is enabled by default.
** Can be disabled in the server properties file:
*** <code>management-server-tls-enabled=false</code>
** Requires a keystore file to be set in the server properties file.
*** <code>management-server-tls-keystore=path/to/keystore.p12</code>
** The keystore file must be in PKCS12 format.
** Keystore password can be set in the following ways, in order of priority.0
*** Environment variable: <code>MINECRAFT_MANAGEMENT_TLS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD</code>
*** JVM argument: <code>-Dmanagement.tls.keystore.password=</code>
*** Server property: <code>management-server-tls-keystore-password=</code>

'''[[Options]]'''
* Some sound sliders in the Music & Sound options now play a preview sound when adjusting the setting outside a world.
* The Resource Pack and Data Pack selection screens now have a search box.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|69.0}}.

'''[[Server properties]]'''
* Default value of <code>management-server-port</code> was changed from <code>25585</code> to <code>0</code>, assigning an available port each time management server is started.
* Added server property <code>management-server-tls-enabled</code> controlling whether the Minecraft Server Management Protocol uses TLS or not.
** Defaults to <code>true</code>.
* Added server property <code>management-server-tls-keystore</code> controlling the path to the keystore file used for TLS.
** Defaults to an empty string.
** A dedicated server won't start when TLS is enabled and no keystore is provided.
* Added server property <code>management-server-tls-keystore-password</code> controlling the password to the keystore file used for TLS.
** Defaults to an empty string.

'''[[Shaders]]'''
* A new <code>PER_FACE_LIGHTING</code> flag has been added to the following shaders:
** <samp>core/entity.vsh</samp>
** <samp>core/entity.fsh</samp>
* When set, cardinal lighting will be computed separately for front- and back-faces.
* As the game now requires OpenGL 3.3, the version of all shaders are bumped from <code>150</code> to <code>330</code>.

'''[[Splashes]]'''
* Changed the splash "Now on OpenGL 3.2 core profile!" to "Now on OpenGL 3.3 core profile!"

'''[[Textures]]'''
* Moved the result slot of <samp>gui/container/villager.png</samp> up by one pixel.
