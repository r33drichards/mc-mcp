'''McDonald's skins''' refers to a group of several [[skin pack|skins]] of both {{w|McDonaldland}} characters and original designs themed after ''[[Minecraft]]'' that were released as part of the {{AMCM|Free Offer|A Minecraft Movie Free Skin Offer}}. Instead of a singular skin pack with all characters, multiple skin packs with individual skins were released. These skins are obtained by purchasing a Minecraft Movie meal for adults at ''{{w|McDonald's}}'' and then [https://minecraft.net/mcdonalds redeeming the code] printed on the character trading card that comes with the corresponding character toy included in the meal.
