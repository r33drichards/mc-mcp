'''[[Copper Door]]s and [[Copper Trapdoor]]s'''
*Copper doors and trapdoors are now crafted from copper ingots instead of copper blocks.
*Only copper doors and copper trapdoors can now be crafted; other variants are no longer craftable.

'''[[Ominous Trial Spawner]]'''
*Now correctly ejects [[ominous trial key]]s instead of [[trial key]]s.
*Mobs spawned with [[Armor#Armor equipped on mobs|equipment]] that is part of an [[ominous trial]] no longer have a chance to drop that equipment upon death.
*Mobs that can wear equipment now usually spawn with [[enchant]]ed weapons and armor.
**Armor enchantments include [[Protection]] IV, [[Projectile Protection]] IV, and [[Fire Protection]] IV.
**Weapon enchantments include [[Sharpness]] I, [[Knockback]] I, [[Power]] I, and [[Punch]] I.
*Doubled the total number of mobs that ominous trial spawners can spawn when they spawn mobs that are unable to wear equipment (i.e. double the ''total mob'' count).
**Increased the number of simultaneous mobs that those spawners can have by 1 (i.e. increased the ''simultaneous mob'' count by 1).

'''[[Trial Spawner]]'''
*Trial spawners no longer spawn mobs when the {{cd|doMobSpawning}} [[game rule]] is set to {{cd|false}}.
*Ominous trial spawner does not spawn potions and projectiles when there are no valid players in its range.
*The rewards that trial spawners and ominous trial spawners eject is now in parity with {{el|JE}}.
*Projectiles spawned by ominous trial spawner can no longer spawn inside solid blocks.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Ominous Trial]]s'''
*Removed the [[bottle o' enchanting]] from the possible projectiles that can be spawned by an ominous trial spawner.

'''[[Damage#Drowning|Oxygen]] bar'''
*Added an empty state for air bubbles ([[File:Empty Bubble (icon).png|16px]]) along with a wobble when the player is drowning.
*Added a popping sound when bubbles pop on the oxygen bar.

'''[[Trial Chambers]]'''
*Decorated pots in trial chambers now drop less types of items, in order to ease inventory management.<ref>https://x.com/kingbdogz/status/1785700878785093671</ref>{{Info needed|Which items were removed from the loot table?}}
*Trial spawner mob distribution:
**[[Spider]] spawners have been moved from the "small melee" category to the "melee" category.
**[[Slime]] spawners have been moved to the "melee" category to the "small melee" category.
*Adjusted the drop chance of the ''Precipice'' [[music disc]].
*Removed the [[TNT]] trap in the ''Eruption'' chamber ({{cd|chamber/eruption}}).
*Fixed the seams in corridors so they now match.
*Added new variants of the [[Trial Chambers#Entrance|entrance chamber]] ({{cd|corridor/entrance_1}}).

'''[[Mace]]'''
*The mace smash attack no longer creates dirt particles when hitting a target whose center is in the air.
*Doubled the mace's durability from 250 to 500.
*[[Density]] is no longer as powerful and the mace now does less damage when falling from great heights.
** See the {{Slink||New mace damage formula}} below.
**Reduced the mace's base damage to {{hp|5}}. This means the player will do {{hp|6}} damage when {{control|attack|attacking}} with it.
**Reduced the damage per block per level of Density from {{hp|1}} to {{hp|0.5}} (a quarter heart).
**Increased the mace smash attack's damage for shorter falls, and decreased the damage for longer falls:
***The first 3 blocks fallen increase the damage by {{hp|4}} per block
***The next 5 blocks fallen increase the damage by {{hp|2}} per block
***Each block fallen after that increases the damage by {{hp|1}}
*[[Density]], [[Breach]], [[Smite]], and [[Bane of Arthropods]] are now all incompatiable with each other. Each mace can only have 1 of these [[enchantment]]s.

==== New mace damage formula ====
<math>f \left( h \right) = \begin{cases}
6 + \left(4 + 0.5 \cdot D \right) \cdot h, & \text{if } 0 \leq h \leq 3 \\
12 + \left(2 + 0.5 \cdot D \right) \cdot h, & \text{if } 3 < h \leq 8 \\
20 + \left(1 + 0.5 \cdot D \right) \cdot h, & \text{if } 8 < h \\
\end{cases}</math>

<math>f \left( h \right)</math> is the damage done by the mace when falling from a height of <math>h</math> blocks

Here is a graph of what that formula means:

[[File:Desmos-graph (2).png|480px]]
