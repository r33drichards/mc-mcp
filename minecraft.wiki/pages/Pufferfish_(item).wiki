A '''pufferfish''' is a poisonous [[food]] item that is used to brew [[Potion of Water Breathing|Water Breathing potions]]. They can also be used to tame and breed [[nautilus]]es.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
{{Drop sources|Pufferfish}}

===Fishing===
{{Main|Fishing}}
Pufferfish are obtainable through fishing, with a 11.1% chance per attempt. See [[fishing]] for more details. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, pufferfish cannot be caught in [[jungle]], sparse jungle, or bamboo jungle biomes.

== Usage ==

=== Food ===
Pufferfish restores {{hunger|1}} hunger and 0.2 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]], but inflicts [[Hunger_(effect)|Hunger]] III for 15 seconds, [[Poison]] II for 1 minute, and [[Nausea]] I for 15 seconds. Unlike [[rotten flesh]], it is not helpful to eat pufferfish while starving because they inflict more hunger than they earn.

=== Brewing ingredient ===
{{brewing
  |Pufferfish
  |Potion of Water Breathing
  |showvariants=1
}}

=== Dolphins ===
A [[dolphin]] can be fed pufferfish to increase its trust of the player and cause it to interact with the player more often. However, unlike most other animal mobs, this does not cause them to breed. Additionally, pufferfish can be used to make baby dolphins grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

Dolphins swim to the nearest chest in a [[shipwreck]] or [[underwater ruin]] after they are fed pufferfish. If the chest in the nearest structure is broken, they swim to another structure with a chest.

Dolphins are immune to the Nausea, Hunger and Poison effects.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Wolves ===
Pufferfish can be used to feed [[wolves]], healing them by {{hp|2|mob=1}}. However, {{in|Bedrock}}, unlike other wolf food, pufferfish cannot be used to speed up the growth of baby wolves nor used to breed them and can only be fed to a wolf that is not at full health.

Wolves are immune to the Nausea, Hunger and Poison effects.

=== Nautilus ===
{{Expand section|Nautilus healing info.}}
Pufferfish can be used to tame [[nautilus]] and [[zombie nautilus]], with each attempt having a 1/3 chance of suceeding.

== Trivia ==

* The consumption of pufferfish inflicting the player with Nausea and Poison is based on reality. Real pufferfish contain the dangerous [[Wikipedia:Tetrodotoxin|tetrodotoxin]] within their organs, especially in the liver. Tetrodotoxin leads to quick death through respiratory paralysis. Muscle tissue and blood contain trace amounts. In East Asia, pufferfish are considered a delicacy known as [[Wikipedia:Fugu|fugu]], as small parts of the fish are actually edible. Any chef preparing fugu must have special licensing/certification to prepare this dish.
* Pufferfish being used for both creating [[Potion of Water Breathing|water breathing potions]] and taming [[Nautilus|nautiluses]] is intentional as pufferfish are seen as the gateway to breathing underwater.<ref>{{ytl|O_ol96-e2G8|SPEAR AND NAUTILUS MAYHEM <nowiki>|</nowiki> Minecraft LIVE – September 2025|t=5m51s}} 5m51s.</ref>
