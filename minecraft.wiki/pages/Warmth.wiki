== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Warmth.ogg]]

"Warmth" starts with loud, hollow sounds of something banging on a metallic object, which fades into soft, warm, bubbly-sounding synthesizer music, with an organ playing chords and some ambient clicking sounds in the background.

Near the end, the music turns back into banging sounds, but louder and less muted. At the end are sounds of a large amount of a water-like liquid flowing.
