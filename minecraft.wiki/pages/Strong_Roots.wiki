'''Strong roots''' are a joke [[block]] only present in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Strong roots have no assigned [[tool]], meaning they are mined at the same speed regardless of the tool used. Strong roots never drop as an [[item]] when mined, even with [[Silk Touch]].

=== Natural generation ===
Strong roots generate in [[potato village]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
[[Powerful potato]]es can grow strong roots out of its sides and downward.

== Usage ==
If strong roots are connected to a powerful potato and they receive a random tick, they attempt to grow horizontally (any direction has a {{frac|1|14}} chance) or downward ({{frac|10|14}} chance). Strong roots don't grow into spaces that would connect separate branches of the upside-down "tree", similarly to chorus plants. They also don't grow if they are already connected to four other strong roots.

Every block that is replaced by strong roots gets dropped on top of the powerful potato they are connected with. The block drops as it was mined with a proper tool, and with following enchantments:
*60% of the time - no enchantments
*20% of the time - [[Fortune]] III
*20% of the time - [[Silk Touch]]

Strong roots can replace [[barrier]]s, [[end portal block]], [[command block]]s and most other blocks in game. Exceptions include other powerful potatoes, other strong roots, and blocks in <code>#features_cannot_replace</code> [[tag]].

=== Piston interactivity ===
Strong roots are destroyed when pushed by [[piston]]s. They do not stick to sticky pistons, [[slime block]]s or [[honey block]]s.
