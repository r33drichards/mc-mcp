'''Warped roots''' are a non-solid "plant" block which generate naturally on [[warped nylium]] and [[soul soil]] in [[warped forest]]s. They resemble a colony of tall, thin mushrooms.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Warped roots can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] with any tool. They drop themselves when broken. Flower pots containing warped roots drop both the flower pot and warped roots when broken.

=== Natural generation ===
Warped roots generate often in [[warped forest]] biome in [[the Nether]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding warped roots drops the block upon death.

=== Post-generation ===
Applying [[bone meal]] to [[warped nylium]] causes warped roots to appear on nearby warped or [[crimson nylium]].

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
[[File:RootsSproutsPlaceBlock.png|thumb|All of the blocks that warped roots can be placed on.]]
Warped roots are decorative blocks. They can be planted on the same blocks that [[warped fungi]] can be placed on. Warped roots can be planted in a [[flower pot]], which gives them a different texture.

=== Composting ===
Warped roots can also be used on a [[composter]], with a 65% chance of increasing the level by 1.
