"Precipice" is a fast-paced song composed of several instruments. It starts with several bell-like instruments ringing an eight-note melody, as it is slowly joined by a synth in the background. Drum-like instruments soon joins to add rhythm to the song, while a piano fades in to play into its own section of the song. After a small rest with only the synth in the background, bells, and some minor scratchy beats, "Precipice" returns in full motion, with the eight-note melody played on multiple instruments and an electric guitar in the background.

Later, another rest occurs with the song slowly becoming quieter. A piano plays out an eight-note melody, and as this section of the song continues, more instruments are added on until eventually song returns much louder. The eight-note melody returns, played in reverse ("ascending," rather than "descending"), which continues through the rest of the song. After reaching the climax, the guitars rings out several more notes before it and the other instruments fade out.

== Usage ==
Like all music discs, {{control|using}} the "Precipice" music disc on a [[jukebox]] causes the jukebox to play the song.

If the [[player]] places a [[redstone comparator]] besides a jukebox playing "Precipice", it will emit a [[Redstone mechanics|redstone signal]] of 13.
