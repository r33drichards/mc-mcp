'''Jon Kågström''' aka Jon Maiga is a software engineer for ''[[Minecraft]]''. He was hired for [[Mojang Studios]] on 28 December 2011, having previously worked on AI for Battlefield. He helped [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] create new "smart" AI for the [[mobs]] in ''Minecraft''. One of his contributions was adding [[Ocelot|Ocelots]]/[[Cat|Cats]] to the game. (He made everything except the texture which was made by Jeb.) He played an active role alongside [[Jens Bergensten|Jeb]] in developing ''Minecraft'' features, fixes, and improvements for [[Java Edition 1.2.1]]. After this, he left ''Minecraft'' development to work on ''Scrolls''. Since the development of ''Scrolls'' was discontinued, he went back to working on Minecraft.
