In ''[[Minecraft 4k]]'', the '''grass block''' has a block ID of 1. It was originally the [[XOR Block]]. Unlike normal ''[[Minecraft]]'', grass blocks do not turn into [[Minecraft 4k/Dirt|dirt]] when a block is placed above it.

[[File:Upscaled 4k grass side texture.png|thumb|right|The grass block's side texture if it was 512&times;512 instead of 16&times;16]]
The texture for the Grass block was generated by the game at runtime (similarly to [[Procedural animated texture generation|what was done in Java Edition at that time for water and lava]]), rather than being stored inside of the jar as an image file.

A sinusoidal function is used to determine which of the pixels on the side belong to grass and which belong to dirt. This function becomes much more obvious when a higher-resolution version of the texture is generated.<ref>https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/MC-TextureGen/releases/tag/v1.7.0</ref>
