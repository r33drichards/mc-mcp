'''Minecraft 2024: A year in blocks''' is an informational animation recounting many of the events and records of the year [[2024]], narrated as a poem.

== Summary ==
As [[Snowfall|snow]] falls in a [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]], an [[allay]] flies by a [[rabbit]] and over near a cabin, where the [[Player|heroes]] of ''Minecraft'' are staying. As [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] rest by a [[Campfire|fireplace]], [[Sunny]] falls asleep by a [[Glass Pane|window]]. Suddenly, [[Efe]] barges into the room, an [[armadillo]] sneaking inside. Efe places a [[map]] into an [[item frame]] beside many collectibles, such as a [[sniffer egg]], before Kai appears and begins breaking apart the [[Bamboo Mosaic|floor]]. [[Zuri]] rests on top of a [[Blast Furnace|blast furnace]], before [[Noor]] drops several items into a [[hopper]].

[[Makena]] rests on a [[bed]], not quite asleep yet, wearing [[netherite armor]] trimmed with [[Resin Brick|resin]], and then pets a [[woods wolf]]. Kai pulls a [[lever]] in a factory area, crafting many items such as [[rails]], [[bread]], [[crossbow]]s, [[Golden Apple|golden apples]], [[Block of Raw Gold|blocks of raw gold]], and [[Golden Hoe|golden hoes]]. Steve sleeps comfortably beside an armadillo, dreaming about adventuring with their friends in the trial chamber, while Alex dreams about a [[pale garden]]. Picking up pale plants, the dream quickly turns into a nightmare, as several [[creakings]] appear and wake them up. Undeterred, Alex puts on a netherite helmet.

Efe, now asleep, rests on a bed marked with hearts alongside many [[cakes]]. An armadillo sniffs the cake. Suddenly, Sunny awakens, as does Steve, who then discovers Zuri putting on [[diamond boots]]. Noor pulls out a [[treasure map]], handing it over to Kai, revealing it leads to a trial chamber. From above, Makena appears, ready for an adventure. Sunny and Efe begin packing items such as [[trial key]]s, before everyone rushes out into the outdoors. Sunny helps everyone out into the wild, while Steve rides atop a [[minecart]] and Alex a [[pig]]. Before the video concludes, the allay appears, welcoming the new year.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|This year you – the Minecraft community – placed billions of blocks (over 300 billion in fact!) crafted millions of maces, and created thousands of crafters. You explored features from our three game drops: Armored Paws, Bundles of Bravery, and the Garden Awakens, plus took on the challenges of the Tricky Trials update. Since you made our 15th year of Minecraft so special, this one's for you!|Video description}}

== Videos ==
{{YouTube|uoh0Ks85U5o}}{{YT|dqvT3OTB6dE}}

== Trivia ==
* Throughout the video, many references to previous media are made.
** Efe possessing a sniffer egg could be a reference to [[A Tale of Two Friends]].
** The two teams of heroes in the trial chamber (first Steve, Sunny, Efe, and Makena, then Noor and Ari) is consistent with [[Tricky Trials Update Official Trailer]].
** Efe being interested in cake could be a reference to a piece of artwork promoting the [[Tricky Trials]] update.

=== Errors ===

* The bottom of Steve's torso can be seen in one shot, revealing it's cyan like their shirt.
* Kai breaks a bamboo mosaic floor with a [[pickaxe]], despite the official tool being an [[axe]].
