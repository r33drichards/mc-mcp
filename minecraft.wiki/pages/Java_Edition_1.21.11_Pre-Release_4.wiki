A separate [[unobfuscated version]] of 1.21.11 Pre-Release 4 was released, titled '''1.21.11 Pre-Release 4 Unobfuscated''' (or '''1.21.11-pre4_unobfuscated''' when in the launcher).

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Nautilus]]''' and '''[[zombie nautilus]]'''
* [[Dispenser]]s can now equip [[saddle]]s and [[nautilus armor]] on tamed nautiluses and zombie nautiluses.
* Dismounting a nautilus or zombie nautilus while on land no longer places the player inside the nautilus.
** This works given that there is a valid block to place the player on.
** If there is no valid block, the player will be placed inside the nautilus as before.
* Zombie nautilus drops are now affected by [[Looting]].

=== General ===
'''[[Creative mode]]'''
* The [[attack range]] extension for players in Creative mode is set to 2 blocks.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|94.1}}.

'''[[Data component format|Item components]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:attack_range}}: Added fields.
** {{cd|min_creative_reach}}: float, the minimum distance in blocks from the Creative Mode attacker to the target to be considered valid.
*** Default value: {{cd|0.0}}, valid from {{cd|0.0}} to {{cd|64.0}}
** {{cd|max_creative_reach}}: float, the maximum distance in blocks from the Creative Mode attacker to the target to be considered valid.
*** Default value: {{cd|5.0}}, valid from {{cd|0.0}} to {{cd|64.0}}
