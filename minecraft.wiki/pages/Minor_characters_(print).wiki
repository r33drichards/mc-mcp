Throughout several series of [[Minecraft books|books]], many '''minor characters''' appear. These are characters with names and personalities, but no sufficient depth.

== Max Brooks' trilogy ==

=== King Graham ===
During [[Minecraft: The Island]], [[Guy]] discovers the [[painting]] ''[[Graham]]''. He immediately recognizes it as being the main character of the game ''{{Wikipedia|King's Quest}}'', faintly remembering it for reasons beyond him.

=== Exterminator ===
During the events of {{WSC|2}}, [[Woodsword Middle School]] becomes overrun with [[Bats (Woodsword Chronicles)|bats]], who end up taking over the gymnasium. In spite of [[Ms. Minerva]] and her class objecting, an exterminator is called over by the school board to kill them. He is depicted as a middle aged man wearing a jumpsuit, a pilot's hat, and a strange vacuum-like device on his back, similar to the {{Wikipedia|proton pack}} from the ''{{Wikipedia|Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters}}'' franchise. He arrives on Saturday, driving up in a van decorated with creatures marked with red slashes, but are quickly told the situation has been resolved peacefully. Frustrated, the exterminator drives off without a gig.

=== Fantasies ===
In many books, there are several, usually brief, fantasies done by characters. Upon enrolling in [[Woodsword Middle School]], Ash was reminded of a fantasy castle, imagining a swarm of bats flying out of it. These are drawn differently from the [[Bats (Woodsword Chronicles)|bats]] in the following book. In {{WSC|6}}, when [[Ms. Minerva]] asks what causes rainbows, [[Jodi Mercado|Jodi]] fantasizes about {{Wikipedia|leprechauns}}, and proceeds to give them as an answer. In {{WSC|5|1}}, while speculating on the source of the [[Evoker King]]'s powers, Jodi speculates it could be a unicorn mob, or an "AI Genie."

Throughout the series, there's a running gag of characters making assumptions about [[Doc Culpepper]], usually outlandish and unfounded. Upon first being introduced, it was proposed she might have come from the future, losing a war against evil robots and emerging through a time portal. In reality, she drove to the school in a minivan. In {{WSC|1|2}}, Jodi, while under the codename [[Agent J]], suggestions that she is in the process of "replacing the librarians with cyborgs." While doing this, she imagines a robot working at the library, not a cyborg.

== Dark Horse Comics ==

=== Catman ===
Within the opening of [[Minecraft: Volume 1]], it's established that series protagonist [[Tyler]] is a fan of a comic book character named Catman. He has a poster of the character on his wall, which took priority while unboxing, as well as a comic book and an action figure. Although the name and association with comics resembles [[Batman]], the character appears to be an anthropomorphic cat with ripped shorts instead of a human in a costume.

=== Changes ===
During the events of the story [[Changes]], a young girl named [[Penny]] discovers she has "{{MC}} powers." This is apparently a form of puberty, or at least similar to it, Penny remarking that her mother had told her to expect changes. In spite of the happenstance, she proceeds to go to [[Jackson Middle School|school]], and tries to search out her friend [[Phillip]]. While looking for him, several people are seen, including students and what appear to be teachers.

=== Dueling skeletons ===
{{Expand section|Rest of appearances}}
Throughout each of the issues, several characters are shown to be fans of a media franchise called Skeleton Duels. In this series, skeletons duel, during all of the seventeen known issues. [[Steph]] finds this formula monotonous, but [[Ethan]] is reluctant to question the status quo. Later, Evan is shown to be a big fan of the series, hanging a picture of it on his wall beside a [[wither skeleton]].
