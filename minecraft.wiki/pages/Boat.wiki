'''Boats''' (including '''bamboo rafts''') are drivable vehicle [[entities]] that can be ridden through [[water]] or at high speeds across all types of [[Ice (disambiguation)#Blocks|ice]]. Most [[mob]]s will ride nearby boats, which they cannot control or exit on their own.

== Obtaining ==
Boats can be crafted with any Overworld planks; crimson and warped planks cannot be used to make boats.<ref>{{bug|MC-170868|||Invalid}}</ref>

Boats can be retrieved by repeatedly hitting them until they drop as an item. In ''Java Edition'', [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s that deal more than {{Health|4}} damage can destroy a boat in one hit.

== Usage ==
Boats can be used for the transportation of [[player]]s and [[mob]]s, sold for emeralds, or used as [[fuel]].

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting usage|Any Boat}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Fuel ===
A boat used as fuel in a [[furnace]] lasts 60 seconds, smelting up to 6 items.

=== Transportation ===
{{see also|Transportation|Riding}}

==== Entering ====
A player enters a boat by {{control|using}} it, if the boat is not fully occupied (boats can hold two entities). Unlike [[bed]]s, there is no message above the hotbar for attempting to enter a fully occupied boat.<ref>{{bug|MC-161251|||WAI}}</ref>

==== Exiting ====
A boat can be exited by {{control|sneaking}} or {{in|BE}}, pressing down the right analog stick on a controller, tapping the "Leave Boat" button when using touch controls, or {{control|jumping}}. When exiting a boat, the player is placed in the direction the player is facing, or, if facing directly up or down, the player is placed in front of the boat. The exiting player is placed on land if possible from the dismounting position.

==== Motion ====
Boats do not turn with mouse-look. 

With a keyboard or gamepad, boats are controlled using the {{control|forward}}, {{control|left}} (turns left), {{control|right}} (turns right), and {{control|backward}} keys. Using the {{control|sprint}} key increases the field of vision, but does not increase speed as if [[sprinting]].

With touchscreen controls, two buttons for steering appear. The right button or key steers to the left, and the left button or key steers to the right. Pressing both buttons or keys moves the boat forward.

{{IN|Java}}, boats can be ridden against a current, but cannot be ridden upstream to a higher elevation. A boat lift, usually made from tripwire, pistons, and optionally a slime block, can be used to move a boat up. Bubble columns created with soul sand can also be used to push boats upward. These mechanisms can also be used {{in|bedrock}} but are usually unnecessary because boats can be ridden upward in descending water, as well as [[Tutorials/Water-powered boat transportation|follow upward stair-step currents]].

Boats accelerate at 16 ms<sup>-2</sup> forward and 2 ms<sup>-2</sup> backward in the direction the boat is facing. At the beginning of every tick, friction is applied to the boat by multiplying its horizontal velocity by a coefficient: in water, air, or under flowing water, this value is 0.9; underwater, this value is 0.45; on land, this value is the average friction of all solid blocks underneath the boat (e.g. 0.6 for most blocks, 0.98 for [[ice]] and 0.989 for [[blue ice]]). Assuming that the initial boat speed (in blocks per tick, not metres per second) is ''u'', the friction coefficient is constant at ''μ'' and the number of ticks is ''t'', if the boat is accelerating constantly then the following equations give ''v'', its final speed, and ''s'', the number of blocks it has traveled:

<math>\mathbf{v} = \mu^t \mathbf{u} + 0.04 \left(\frac{1 - \mu^t}{1 - \mu} \right)</math>

<math>\mathbf{s} = \frac{1}{1 - \mu} \left(0.04 t + (1 - \mu^t) \left(\mathbf{u} - \frac{0.04}{1 - \mu} \right) \right)</math>

== Behavior ==
=== Speed ===
Boats move according to the player's control or water currents, with speed affected by the surface traversed. Boats move extremely quickly on ice,<ref name="MC-97803">{{bug|MC-97803||Boats going faster on ice than in water|WAI}}</ref> allowing for the construction of fast transportation systems in any dimension.

Drag is applied proportionally against the boat’s current velocity, causing its speed to decay exponentially. {{IN|be}}, boats do not have air resistance, meaning that if a boat is launched off a cliff at a certain speed, it will continue flying at that speed until it touches the ground. 

When the forward or backward command is issued, a constant thrust is applied relative to the boat's facing direction, exponentially approaching the top speed at which thrust balances drag. The backward thrust is one-eighth of the forward thrust’s strength.

When strafe commands are issued, a constant torque is applied to increase the boat's rotation speed, with the same drag mechanism limiting the maximum rate of rotation.

=== Flotation ===
[[File:Oak Boat shake.gif|thumb|right|The animation of an oak boat when atop a [[bubble column]].]]
A boat floats atop still or flowing water. {{IN|java}}, a boat sinks if it enters water flowing downward.<ref>{{bug|MC-91206|||WAI}}</ref> {{IN|bedrock}}, a boat does not sink when submerged but floats up. This feature lets a player contrive stepped uphill water flows to [[Tutorials/Water-powered boat transportation#Floating uphill|propel a boat uphill]] using only flowing water.

When a boat moves over a bubble column, it begins to shake. If the bubbles are caused by a [[magma block]], all passengers are expelled and the boat sinks.

{{IN|java}}, a sunken boat cannot be re-floated until a bubble column pushes it up or it is broken by the player. {{IN|bedrock}}, a boat resumes floating when it emerges from the currents keeping it down, or when the bubble column is blocked or removed.

[[Dolphin]]s chase players riding a boat in motion, occasionally bumping the boat, causing it to shake briefly.

=== Destruction ===
As boats are [[entities]], they have [[health]]. {{IN|je}}, boats effectively have just over {{hp|4}} (exactly 4 damage is not enough to destroy a boat), and regenerate {{frac|1|10}} per game tick. Boats {{in|be}} have {{hp|40}} health.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-62683}}</ref>

Boats can be destroyed by explosions, fire and lava (but not magma blocks), cactus, and by being punched/shot by mobs, such as [[drowned]]. Boats made invulnerable with commands cannot be broken by any of these, but they still cannot be used to travel on lava because they sink.

When a boat is destroyed, it drops itself in item form.

=== Passengers ===
[[File:Multiple mobs in 2 boats.png|alt=|thumb|Multiple mobs in 2 types of boats.]]
Boats can support two riders, including [[mob]]s. A mob cannot exit a boat and is trapped until the boat gets destroyed, or until the player uses a [[fishing rod]] or [[lead]] to remove the mob. This can be used to transport mobs, although hostile mobs still attack while in boats. Mobs riding a boat don't despawn{{only|java}} and don't count toward the mob cap.<ref>{{bug|MC-182897|resolution=WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|java}}, a player cannot both move (row) and use items at the same time. It is still possible to initialize item use (e.g. start eating) and row the boat while the item is still in the middle of the use animation. Although the rowing animation overrides the item use animation, the item can still be successfully consumed.

Being in a boat limits the player's mouse-look to the forward 210° arc {{in|java}} and 180° {{in|bedrock}}.

Underwater boats cannot be ridden. When the boat is underwater, all passengers in it are expelled.

=== Damage prevention ===
Riding a boat does not deplete [[hunger]], making it an efficient way to travel.

Boats can completely nullify [[fall damage]] for themselves and any players/mobs inside, making them useful for travel through mountains or through the Nether<ref>{{bug|MC-105103|resolution=WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-149490|||WAI}}</ref>.

=== Collision ===
A boat has a solid collision box, which means players and other entities can't go through it even at high speeds. Falling blocks are also blocked by boats.

{{IN|java}}, a boat falling on top of an entity stops on top of the entity. {{IN|bedrock}}, a falling boat can go through other entities.

Riding a boat over a [[lily pad]] causes the lily pad to drop, and causes the boat's speed to stutter a bit.

=== Mobs ===
Most mobs can ride boats. Mobs cannot exit the boat unless the boat is destroyed, sinks, or moves over a bubble column.

Mobs can be picked up into the boat when they collide with the side of the boat. A mob cannot control the boat. {{IN|java}}, a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. {{IN|bedrock}}, mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player. {{IN|Education}}, even [[tripod camera]]s can ride boats.

A mob can ride a boat if it is narrower than a boat, and is neither an aquatic<ref group="note">Despite this, turtles are allowed to ride in boats because they are internally a part of the creature's group.</ref> nor ambient animal. The following mobs are ''unable'' to ride in a boat:

{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntityLink|Agent}}
* {{EntityLink|Bat}}
* {{EntityLink|Cod}}
* {{EntityLink|Creaking}}
* {{EntityLink|Elder Guardian}}
* {{EntityLink|Ender Dragon}}
* {{EntityLink|Ghast}}
* {{EntityLink|Giant}}

* {{EntityLink|Wither}}<ref group="note" name="why"/>
}}

The baby counterparts of these mobs can ride in boats, but not the adult versions. If a baby grows up, the adult form is dismounted. Additionally, the adult versions of these mobs can still ride boats manually using the {{cmd|ride}} command:
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntityLink|Camel}}
* {{EntityLink|Camel Husk}}
* {{EntityLink|Donkey}}
* {{EntityLink|Hoglin}}<ref group="note">{{IN|java}}, hoglins are not dismounted if they grow up while in a boat. They can then be zombified to obtain an adult zoglin in a boat.</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-188617}}</ref>
* {{EntityLink|Horse}}
* {{EntityLink|Mule}}
* {{EntityLink|Polar bear}}
* {{EntityLink|Skeleton horse}}
* {{EntityLink|Sniffer}}
* {{EntityLink|Zoglin}}
* {{EntityLink|Zombie horse}}
}}

Additionally, few types of mobs can have various <code>Size</code> values, which can prevent them from riding boats:
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntityLink|Slime}} above size 1
* {{EntityLink|Magma cube}} above size 1
* {{EntityLink|Phantom}} above size 3
}}

=== Lead ===
Leads can be attached to boats and can break when stretched too far due to boats moving much more slowly on land. 

The lead has no effect if a player is riding the boat. However, if any mob is riding the boat, the boat can be tugged along. This includes villagers, making transportation easier in early game with just a few boats and leads.

== Sounds ==
{{JE}}:<br>
Boats use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].

Despite being a solid surface, walking on boats is completely silent and does not produce footstep sounds.<ref>{{bug|MC-101950}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|be}}, [[Sand]], [[red sand]], [[concrete powder]], [[gravel]], [[anvil]]s, and [[dragon egg]]s drop as [[Item (entity)|items]] when they fall onto a boat that is in water.
* A [[chest]] is short enough that a boat falls onto it rather than crashes into it.
* {{IN|console}}, holding the movement stick to the side in a boat on [[blue ice]] causes the player to spin quickly. If a passenger is in the boat while this occurs, when the player exits the boat after it reaches maximum velocity (attained after about three seconds), for most mobs, the mob's head may spin uncontrollably. For some mobs, however, nothing happens (such as [[slime]]s and [[ghast]]s). The mob may also get its head stuck at an angle. Thorough testing was done on ''Wii U Edition'', although the glitch was originally discovered on the ''Xbox 360 Edition''.
