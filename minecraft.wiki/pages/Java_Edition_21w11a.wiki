'''21w11a''' is the fourteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]] released on March 17, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w11a|March 17, 2021}}</ref> which fixes numerous bugs, many of which relate to textures and rendering issues as well as adds new mechanics related to [[copper]].

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Added {{key|F3+L}} shortcut to generate and persist performance metrics from in-game, similar to {{cmd|debug}}.
** Metrics are saved in <samp>[[.minecraft]]/debug/profiling/<''timestamp''>.zip</samp>.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added the {{cd|electric_spark|scrape|wax_off|wax_on|d=and}} particles.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>cluster_max_harvestables</code> item tag.
** Contains all pickaxes.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Amethyst cluster]]'''
* Breaking by hand, [[piston]], or other means now drops 2 [[amethyst shard]]s instead of dropping none.
* Breaking with any pickaxe can now be used to drop 4 amethyst shards instead of an iron pickaxe or higher.

'''[[Azalea]]'''
* Can now be used as [[fuel]] in a [[furnace]].

'''[[Big dripleaf]]'''
* Breaking the stem now drops the block.
* Now can be fertilized with [[bone meal]] on the stem to make the dripleaf grow.

'''[[Block of copper]], [[cut copper]], and variants'''
* [[Honeycomb]] can now be {{Control|used}} to wax them, to match {{BE}}.
** Yellow particles are formed when waxing the block.
* Using a [[dispenser]] with honeycomb waxes them, matching ''Bedrock Edition''.
* [[Axe]]s can now be {{Control|used}} to scrape off wax and oxidation (one stage at a time).
** White particles are formed when scraping off wax from the block.
* [[Lightning]] now may clean oxidation, reverting the oxidation process by one or several stages.
** Chances of cleaning and number of reverted stages are higher the closer to the struck block.
* Waxed copper blocks can be crafted into 4 [[copper ingot]]s, to match ''Bedrock Edition''.

'''[[Brewing stand]]'''
* Changed potion icon in the brewing stand GUI to reflect the new bottle texture in the [[Texture Update]].<ref>{{bug|MC-150784}}</ref>
* Removed some stray pixels from the GUI texture.

'''[[Cauldron]]'''
* [[Lava bucket]]s and [[powder snow bucket]]s can now be emptied in the respective filled cauldrons.

'''[[Cave vines]]'''
* Renamed the parts from "cave vines head" and "cave vines body" to "cave vines" and "cave vines plant", respectively.
** The IDs have also changed.
* Now all parts give a [[light]] level of 14.
** Previously, only the bottom-most part gave level 14; others gave only 10.
* Now slow down the player.
* Can now be climbed.

'''[[Gilded blackstone]]'''
* The texture has changed.

'''[[Glow lichen]]'''
* [[Bone meal]] can no longer be used on it if it has no blocks to spread to.
* Can now be used on a [[composter]].

'''[[Grass block]]'''
* Changed part of the dirt of the side texture of snowy grass to match regular grass.<ref>{{bug|MC-1483}}</ref>

'''[[Hanging roots]]'''
* Now renders randomly offset from the center.
* Removing the support block for it no longer allows it to float.

'''[[Lava]]'''
* Again replaces air below Y=-55.

'''[[Lectern]]'''
* Slightly shrunk top part to prevent z-fighting with [[fire]].<ref>{{bug|MC-214568}}</ref>

'''[[Lightning rod]]'''
* Can now be [[waterlogged]]. 
* Now turns completely white when struck by [[lightning]].
** Has a new block state, "powered", used to determine whether the rod turns completely white when struck by lightning.
* Now emits particles when in contact with rain.

'''[[Moss block]]'''
* Can be combined with [[cobblestone]] or [[stone bricks]] to make the mossy versions of those blocks.
** [[Vines]] can still be used, in addition to moss blocks.
* In addition to [[axe]]s,<ref>{{bug|MC-219960}}</ref> [[hoe]]s are now an appropriate tool to collect it.

'''[[Pumpkin]]'''
* Changed one pixel on the pumpkin's top texture to remove the possibility for a small [[wikipedia:Swastika|swastika]] to be displayed.<ref>{{bug|MC-197561}}</ref>

'''[[Rooted dirt]]'''
* {{Control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on any side grows [[hanging roots]] underneath.

'''[[Sign]]s'''
* Changed the textures of acacia, birch, dark oak, jungle, oak, and spruce signs to reflect new textures in the [[Texture Update]].

'''[[Small dripleaf]]'''
* The facing direction is now determined by which direction the player is facing when placing it.

'''[[Smoker]]'''
* Changed the top texture of the smoker.

'''[[Spore blossom]]'''
* Removing the support block for it no longer allows it to float.

'''[[Tinted glass]]'''
* No longer causes [[suffocation]].
* Mobs can no longer spawn on top of it.

=== Items ===
'''[[Jungle door]]s'''
* Changed the texture of the jungle door item to reflect the block texture in the Texture Update.<ref>{{bug|MC-160195}}</ref>

'''[[Spectral arrow]]s'''
* Fired spectral arrows are now entirely golden to reflect the item texture in the Texture Update.<ref>{{bug|MC-150054}}</ref>

'''[[Sugar cane]]'''
* Changed the texture of the sugar cane item to better reflect biome tinting added in [[Java Edition 1.7.2|1.7.2]].<ref>{{bug|MC-216227}}</ref>

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Cat]]s'''
* Changed the texture of the siamese cat type, mostly brightening it.

'''[[Spectator]] mode'''
