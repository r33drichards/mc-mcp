The '''fletching table''' is a [[fletcher]]'s [[job site block]] that can generate naturally in [[village]]s. It is used to turn an unemployed [[villager]] into a fletcher.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break fletching table is [[axe]].
{{breaking row|Fletching Table|Axe|horizontal=1}}
Fletching table drops itself when it's destroyed.
=== Natural generation ===
Fletching tables can generate naturally inside fletcher houses in [[village]]s.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting

|B1= Flint
|A2= Any Planks
|B2= Any Planks
|A3= Any Planks
|B3= Any Planks
|Output=Fletching Table
|type= Decoration block
}}

== Usage ==
The fletching table currently has no right-click functionality; Its functionality was intended to be added in upcoming updates as of 2019.<ref>{{snap|19w11b|id=}}</ref>

=== Placement ===
Regardless of the player's [[position]] while placement, the different textures of the block are always facing in the same position (the textures with the [[target]] are facing west and east, while the one with the knife and [[feather]] is facing up).

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a fletching table has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to [[fletcher]] and claim the fletching table as their [[job site block]].

=== Fuel ===
Fletching tables can be used as a fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

=== Note Blocks ===
Fletching tables can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
