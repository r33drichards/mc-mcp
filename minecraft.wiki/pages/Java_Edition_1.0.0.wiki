'''1.0.0''' (displayed as release '''1.0''' in the launcher) is the second and last release of the '''[[Adventure Update]]''', and the first full version of the game. It was released on November 18, 2011,<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/478402/getting_started_with_minecraft.html|title=Getting Started With Minecraft|website=PCWorld|date=November 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230926000029/https://www.pcworld.com/article/478402/getting_started_with_minecraft.html}}</ref> during [[MINECON 2011]], marking the game as officially released after two and a half years (916 days)<ref group="note">Days from May 13, 2009 ([[Cave game tech test]] was built) to November 18, 2011 (release of this version).</ref> of development. This version adds [[brewing]], [[enchanting]], [[the End]], [[Hardcore]] mode, [[breeding]], and more. It is the last version of ''Minecraft'' [[Notch]] developed before he gave the creative development position to [[Jens Bergensten]].

Initially named "'''Beta 1.9'''", [[Mojang]] instead opted to release this update under the name "''Minecraft'' 1.0.0", but this decision was made after development versions tagged as Beta 1.9 were already released, so all pre-releases for this version are labeled as "Beta 1.9".

A build of this version made specifically for showcase at [[MINECON 2011]] exists, published inside a password-protected 7z file called <code>tominecon.7z</code>, which differs from the release build by one line of code to fix an authentication bug caused by parsing the server ID as decimal, instead of hexadecimal. The file was put up on the <code>assets.minecraft.net</code> file server before the Mojang employees flew from Sweden to the USA so that they could access a build of 1.0.0 from there before the official release of the version.<ref name="MinecraftUnlimited">{{citation|url=https://old.reddit.com/r/MinecraftUnlimited/comments/1cvo5py/the_full_story_of_tominecon7z_and_its_conclusion/|title=The Full Story of tominecon.7z and its Conclusion|website=Reddit|date=May 19, 2024|archive-url=https://archive.fo/RVEUE}}</ref>

** Hearts will come out of animals while in love mode.
* Breeding will produce baby animals.

'''[[Brewing]]'''
* Produces potions.

'''[[Commands]]'''
* Added {{cmd|toggledownfall}}.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* Debug controls (from the pre-re-uploaded version of [[Beta 1.8 Pre-release]]):
* {{key|F9}}: Freezes the camera in its current position.
* {{key|F6}}: Enables a strange "bouncy" movement. It locks the player's Y coordinate (meaning they cannot jump or fall). It makes the player accelerate relatively slowly when moving. Additionally, the player can also clip into blocks slightly - at a high enough speed, the player can push all the way through a block. Transparent blocks have no clipping whatsoever.
* {{key|N}} and {{key|M}}: Changes the view's rotation clockwise and anti-clockwise, respectively. Hold both keys simultaneously resets the rotation.
* {{key|Y}} and {{key|H}}: Decreases and increases the field of view, respectively. These keys seem to affect the field of view differently to how the FOV option does - the player's hand (or anything the player is holding) also becomes stretched as the field of view increases or decreases, which does not happen if the player changes the FOV option in the menu. Holding both keys simultaneously resets the field of view.
* {{key|I}}: Makes the player look up, {{key|J}} looks left, {{key|K}} looks down, and {{key|L}} looks right. These movements are normally done by moving the mouse. This setting cannot be reset by holding any keys simultaneously.
* {{key|U}} and {{key|O}}: Moves the third-person camera forwards and backwards, respectively. This setting cannot be reset by holding both keys simultaneously.

=== Sound Update ===
Alongside the release of this version, the asset server was updated with the following new sounds:

* The [[chest]] opening and closing now has its own sound, different from the door sound.
* [[Experience orb]]s now make a twinkling sound when collected.
* The entity damage sound has been changed to a genderless bone-cracking sound.
** Players and all mobs make the same bone-cracking sound when taking fall damage.
* Eating and drinking now have sounds.
* [[Blaze]]s have been given an ambient breathing noise.
* [[Endermen]] now have their own sounds instead of using zombie sounds. {{info needed|are these any different to the current sounds?}}
** When they teleport, it sounds like a shortened version of the Nether portal sound.
* [[Magma cube]]s now make sounds.
* [[Silverfish]] now make sounds.
* [[Arrow]] landing was changed to a more twangy sound.{{note|The sound was renamed, meaning older versions of the game still play the old version, unlike the firing sound.}}
* [[Tool]]s and [[armor]] now make a breaking sound, and have a breaking animation.

The following sounds were replaced with new versions on the asset server; thus, the updated sounds also applied to older versions of the game.

* The [[arrow]] firing and thrown item ([[snowball]], [[egg]], [[fishing rod]] and [[eye of ender]]) sound was changed.
* Wooden and iron [[door]]s, [[trapdoor]]s and [[fence gate]]s' opening and closing sounds were changed.
* [[Explosion]]s now have several new, slightly differing sounds instead of just one.

'''Performance'''
* Performance improvements.

== Trivia ==
*Originally, this update was planned to be released as Beta 1.9, but after six pre-releases were pushed out, it was decided that 1.0.0 would be the version name, and to push the release date back to during MINECON 2011.
**The 2014 April Fools joke references the version [[villager]]s were implemented in as Beta 1.9, even though they were technically a 1.0.0 implementation.
*Aside from marking the "true" release of the game, this is the last update to be developed by [[Notch]] before he left the ''Minecraft'' team.
*1.0.0 was the only version with release candidates until [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]].
*1.0.0 is the only major update with no snapshots, as snapshots didn't exist yet.
*1.0.0 was released manually by developers behind the stage at MINECON 2011 as Notch pulled the "lever" on stage, since the team couldn't schedule the update to be released at an exact moment.<ref>{{ytl|PIAP8peEppI|The Beginning - Part 1: 15 Years of Minecraft|Minecraft|June 3, 2024|t=447s}}</ref>
