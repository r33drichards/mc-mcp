== Trivia ==
* "So Below" is from a Judea-Christian term relating to the concept that whatever happens within the holy temple is indicative of whatever happens in Heaven. The full saying is “As above, so below”, and it’s a clear perversion of holy language to emphasize that the Nether is like a hell.<ref>{{tweet|kuraine|1275489665345150977|I'm going to start up a thread here where every day I'll be running through a little behind-the-scenes insights on one track I wrote for the Nether Update~ I'll kick it off with Chrysopoeia a lil later today, so stay tuned ✨|June 23, 2020|archive=1}}</ref>
