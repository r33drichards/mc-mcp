The paeonia was a [[flower]] type originally planned for implementation in [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], but got replaced with the [[peony]].

== Obtaining ==
Paeonias would presumably have been obtainable through similar methods to other flowers. The only released screenshot depicts them planted in a taiga biome, though as peony bushes have never generated in this biome it is unknown if they would have naturally generated here.

== Usage ==
Paeonias would presumably have been craftable into pink dye like the peony bushes that replaced them, and would have had the same properties that are shared by all one block tall flowers.

== History ==
Originally revealed by [[Jeb]] in a screenshot,<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/dE8ljlJMLb/ "I've been adding a bunch of new flowers to #minecraft. One of them is the pink Paeonia, as it was the main flower for our wedding"] – [https://www.instagram.com/jebkhaile/ @jebkhaile], August 16, 2013</ref> the flower was never implemented, being superseded by the [[peony]].

However, the texture for the paeonia was still added to the game's texture files in [[Java Edition 13w36a|13w36a]] as <samp>flower_paeonia.png</samp>, alongside all the actually implemented flowers. This texture persisted in the files for over four years, eventually being removed in [[Java Edition 17w47a|17w47a]] without a doubt due to resource changes and [[Java Edition Flattening|the Flattening]].

Interestingly, despite the texture being completely unused throughout its presence in the game files, paeonias were redone in the [[Texture Update]] beta packs. The texture is present in the ''Bedrock Edition'' default resource pack, having been added along with the other texture update textures.
