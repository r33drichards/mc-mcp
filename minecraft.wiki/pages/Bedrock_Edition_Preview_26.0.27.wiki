* Changed swimming animation.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn Egg]]'''
* Now always spawn baby mobs when {{control|using}} on the same mob {{in|be}}, to match ''Java Edition''.

=== Graphical ===
* Dithering:
** Added dithering to items held by players and mobs if dithering is enabled.
** Added dithering to skulls, heads, chests, shulker boxes, banners, conduits, decorated pots, and copper golem statues held by players and mobs if dithering is enabled.
** Added cobweb block to the list of ditherable blocks.
* Data-driving:
** Added the ability to specify ambient light colors and illuminances, and sky light light intensity according to the time of day in the Vibrant Visuals lighting configuration files.

=== Technical ===
'''AI Goals'''
* Made the schema for for the following goals stricter when parsing, they will now fail to load an entity json that has invalid data in versions 1.26.0 and newer:
** {{cd|minecraft:behavior.delayed_attack}}
** {{cd|minecraft:behavior.dragonstrafeplayer}}
** {{cd|minecraft:behavior.dragonchargeplayer}}
** {{cd|minecraft:behavior.melee_attack}}
** {{cd|minecraft:behavior.melee_box_attack}}
** {{cd|minecraft:behavior.stomp_attack}}
* Float Range field {{cd|target_zone}} in {{cd|minecraft:behavior.dragonchargeplayer}} and {{cd|minecraft:behavior.dragonstrafeplayer}} now only accepts an object with min and max values. Other formats will fail to parse.
* Added new fields to {{cd|minecraft:jump.dynamic}}:
** {{cd|regular_skip_data}}: Used during normal skip movement.
*** {{cd|distance_scale}}: The multiplier applied to horizontal velocity when jumping.
*** {{cd|height}}: The force applied vertically when jumping.
*** {{cd|jump delay}}: Amount of ticks between sequential jumps.
*** {{cd|animation_duration}}: Duration of the jump animation.
** {{cd|fast_skip_data}}: Used when travelling quickly with skip movement.
*** {{cd|distance_scale}}: The multiplier applied to horizontal velocity when jumping.
*** {{cd|height}}: The force applied vertically when jumping.
*** {{cd|jump delay}}: Amount of ticks between sequential jumps.
*** {{cd|animation_duration}}: Duration of the jump animation.

'''[[Block components|Block Components]]'''
* Added block permutation component validation for geometry and material instance components. If one is added, the other one will need to added.
** Raises a warning for blocks with a format_version from before 1.26.0.
** Raises an error for blocks with a format_version of 1.26.0 and after.
* The Block Trait {{cd|minecraft:connection}} can now be used without the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.
* {{cd|minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction}} in {{cd|minecraft:placement_direction}} can now be used without the Beta APIs toggle.
* Updated documentation for the {{cd|use_liquid_clipping}} field in {{cd|minecraft:liquid_detection}} to better explain its use.
* Updated the {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} block component:
** Changed {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} so DOWN face is rotated 180 degrees, this brings it in parity with non data driven full blocks and Java full blocks.
** The old geometry can still used by explicitly using the identifier {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block_v1}}.
** Any existing blocks using {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block}} that have a {{cd|format_version}} less than 1.26.0 will look the same and internally be considered as {{cd|minecraft:geometry.full_block_v1}}.
* Released {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} improvements from experimental and removed requirement of format version 1.21.130 or higher for those improvements.
** Can now have an array of collision boxes.
** Max height has been increased from 16 to 24.
* Game no longer crashes on initializing {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} component when the server sends invalid packets.

'''[[Camera]]'''
* Provided the script API for supporting entity type families in the aim assist.

'''Components'''
* Updated {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_X}} behavior components:
** Made schemas stricter when parsing and will fail to load an entity json that has invalid data in versions 1.26.0 and newer:
*** {{cd|min_look_time}} and {{cd|max_look_time}} - deprecated and has been replaced properly with {{cd|look_time}}.
**** Uses of {{cd|min_look_time}} and {{cd|max_look_time}} will get upgraded automatically.
**** {{cd|look_time}} - takes {{cd|min}} and {{cd|max}} as a range.
** These changes affect the following behavior components:
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_entity}}
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_player}}
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_target}}
*** {{cd|minecraft.behaviour.look_at_trading_player}}
** Previous usage of the following definitions will not be automatically upgraded to preserve old behavior:
*** {{cd|look_time}} - this was not correctly parsed prior to version 1.26.0, and always resulted in default values being assigned to {{cd|min_look_time}} and {{cd|max_look_time}}.
*** {{cd|target_distance}} - was used in some definitions and it was never passed to the component.
**** This would just silently fail and assign default values to the component.

'''Entity'''
* All projectiles now deflect {{cd|reflect_on_hurt:true}} projectiles on hit.
** This is in addition to damage causing these projectiles to be deflected.

'''Entity Components'''
* Split the {{cd|minecraft:breedable}} component into two:
** {{cd|minecraft:offspring_data}} which defines how an offspring of an entity is born, it contains the following fields moved from {{cd|minecraft:breedable}}:
*** {{cd|blend_attributes}}
*** {{cd|inherit_tamed}}
*** {{cd|mutation_factor}}
*** {{cd|mutation_strategy}}
*** {{cd|random_variant_mutation_interval}}
*** {{cd|random_extra_variant_mutation_interval}}
*** {{cd|deny_parents_variant}}
*** {{cd|breeds_with}}
*** {{cd|combine_parent_colors}}
*** {{cd|property_inheritance}}
*** {{cd|parent_centric_attribute_blending}}
** {{cd|minecraft:breedable}} now only contains data about how an entity uses breeding behavior.
*** The way it spawns the child entity is via the {{cd|minecraft:offspring_data}} component.

'''General'''
* Now possible to reuse keybinding for normal actions, macros, and chords.

'''Network Protocol'''
* {{cd|ActorType}} modified: added {{cd|ActorType::Undead}}.
* {{cd|ActorType}} modified: renamed {{cd|ActorType::UndeadMob}} to {{cd|ActorType::UndeadMonster}}.
* {{cd|ActorCategory}} modified: renamed {{cd|ActorCategory::UndeadMob}} to {{cd|ActorCategory::UndeadMonster}}.
* Added new Level Sound Event {{cd|saddle_in_water}}.
** {{cd|Levelsoundevent}} modified: added unique sound events for every spear type.

'''[[Tag (Bedrock Edition)|Tags]]'''
* Added new [[Biome tag (Bedrock Edition)|biome tags]].
** {{cd|slime}} tag allows slime to spawn higher than usual.
** {{cd|swamp_water_huge_mushroom}} tag allows huge mushrooms to spawn in shallow swamp water.
** {{cd|fast_fishing}} tag increases fishing speed.
** {{cd|high_seas}} tag alters salmon behavior.
** {{cd|surface_mineshaft}} tag changes surface mineshaft blocks to dark oak.
