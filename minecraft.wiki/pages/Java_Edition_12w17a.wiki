== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Oak Slab JE3 BE2.png|36px]] '''[[Wooden Slab|Wooden Slabs]]'''
* Slabs for each of the four types of wood added.
** New block IDs <code>125</code> for double wooden slabs and <code>126</code> for single wooden slabs.
** These new slabs no longer act like stone.
** An [[axe]] should be used to break them.
** They are no longer immune to [[fire]] and [[lava]].
** Wooden slabs created in older versions of ''Minecraft'' are still stone-like and fireproof and don't change to the new slabs when placed or mined.

=== Items ===
[[File:Book and Quill JE1 BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Book and Quill|Book and Quills]]'''
* Editable books, crafted using a [[book]], [[feather]], and [[ink sac]].
** When a book and quill is made, it can be right-clicked to open a screen that allows player to type in the book.
** Pressing "Done" saves whatever was typed and allows player to edit the book again later, yet does not "sign" it.
** When "signing" a book, it allows player to choose a title up to 16 characters long and disable editing of the book, the book and quill then becomes a written book, with the icon changing along with the label.

[[File:Written Book JE1 BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Written Book]]'''
* Looks the same as a regular book, but has a shine like an enchantment.
* After being finished, the written book cannot be edited again.

=== Commands ===
'''General'''
* {{cmd|help}} and alias {{cmd|?}} added.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added 'Chat Options'.
** Added chat opacity, letting the chat be semi-transparent.

** Added "Only Commands" mode to chat.

== Changes ==
