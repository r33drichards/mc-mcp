A '''moss block''' is a natural block that can be spread to other blocks by using [[bone meal]].

== Obtaining ==
[[File:Moss block range.png|thumb|Farthest range moss spreads from a central moss block in ''Java Edition''. In ''Bedrock Edition'', the source block would be a few blocks above the center.]]

=== Breaking ===
Moss blocks can be mined using any tool or by hand, but a [[hoe]] is fastest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Moss Block|link=none|Hoe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Moss generates on the floor and ceiling within the [[lush caves]] biome. They can also be found in [[trial chambers]] indicating that a [[trial spawner]] can spawn [[slime]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a moss block drops the block upon death.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|moss-block}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 2 moss blocks for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
When [[bone meal]] is {{control|used}} on a moss block, moss spreads to any of the blocks listed below, if they have [[air]] blocks immediately above them, in a cornerless 7×11×7 volume centered on the original moss block. Foliage can replace air on any of these blocks.

The following blocks can be replaced with moss blocks:

When a moss block generates with air above it, it has a chance to have [[grass]], an [[azalea]], or a [[moss carpet]] growing on it.

==== Spreading specifics ====
{{IN|java}}, when [[bone meal]] is {{control|used}} on a moss block, first the game checks that the block directly above the moss block is air. If successful, maximum X and Z distances are chosen (independently from each other) with a 50% chance of being either 2 or 3. Then, in a rectangular area centered on the moss block restricted to those maximum distances, the game decides independently for each vertical column whether a block is converted to moss. Each corner has a 0% chance to be selected, each edge has a 75% chance, and the rest of the blocks are always selected. If this check succeeds, a scan is started at a y-level one above the moss block to find a block with [[air]] above it. If the scan starts in an air block, it searches up to 6 blocks downward. If it starts in a non-air block, it searches up to 4 blocks upward. Both scans stop on the first block with air above it, even if it cannot be converted to moss. The chosen block is converted to moss if possible, and if so (or if it already was a moss block) there is a 60% chance that vegetation generates above it.

Each piece of bone meal used on a flat 7×7 grid of convertible blocks yields on average 27 moss blocks (varies widely), which give about 2.5 bone meal when put through a [[composter]].

{{IN|java}}, blocks that can be replaced by moss are listed in the <code>moss_replaceable</code> block tag, which includes blocks with the <code>base_stone_overworld</code>, <code>cave_vines</code> and <code>dirt</code> tags. This theoretically also includes blocks such as [[cave vines]] and [[dirt path]], which cannot be converted because they do not have a solid top surface aligned with the block grid.{{More info needed|bedrock=behavior in bedrock needs clarification}}

== Usage ==
All plants can be placed on moss except for [[cacti]]. [[Small dripleaves]] can be placed on moss blocks even outside of [[water]]. [[Nether fungi]] can also be placed on moss, while [[mushroom]]s can be placed only at light level 12 or below. Mushrooms placed on moss blocks can be grown into [[huge mushroom]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a moss block into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Sniffer eggs ===
A [[sniffer egg]] hatches twice as fast as normal when on top of a moss block.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Moss blocks are destroyed and dropped as [[item (entity)|items]] when pushed by [[piston]]s. They do not stick to sticky pistons, [[slime block]]s or [[honey block]]s.
