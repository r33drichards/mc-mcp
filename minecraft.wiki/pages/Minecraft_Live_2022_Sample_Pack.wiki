== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Create your own mob in less than 30 seconds?! You better believe it! The Minecraft Entity Wizard allows for a simple way to quickly make an entity and get it to the game, thus removing the tedious work of gathering all the files needed for its resource and behavior pack. Build from scratch, start with inspiration and choose the closest likeness in appearance and behavior, or create a wacky mash-up – such as a dolphin with the terrifying behavior of a phantom, or maybe a warden with the calm attitude of a snow golem. Everything is possible!|Microsoft Learn}}
