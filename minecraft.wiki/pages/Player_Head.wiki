The '''player head''' is a [[block]] based on the [[head]] of a [[player]]'s [[skin]] ([[Steve]] by default). Player heads cannot be obtained in [[Survival]].

== Obtaining ==
The player head can be obtained only by using [[Creative inventory]], {{control|picking block}} or executing {{cmd|give}}.
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of player head.<ref>{{bug|MC-192905||Heads & Skulls have no assigned tool}}</ref>

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Player Head}}

Player head drops itself when it's destroyed.

When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the player head always drops as an item.

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
Player heads can be oriented in 16 different directions when placed on top of a block, and in 4 directions when placed on the sides of blocks, similar to signs. They can be placed either on top of or beside blocks by shift-clicking.

=== Wearing ===
The player can wear player heads, similarly to [[pumpkin]]s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a player head on a [[player]], [[mob]], or [[Armor Stand|armor stand]] with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

=== Enchantments ===
Player heads can receive the following [[enchantment]]s, but only through an [[anvil]].

=== Piston interactivity ===
Player head is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].
== Player skins ==
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Player heads can be given [[Chunk format#Entity Format|NBT data]] so that they appear with the skin of any ''Minecraft'' account. This means if a player knows that a specific account has a head that is desired to display, the NBT data can be edited to make it appear. Commonly, this kind of head is called a custom head.

The command to give the player a head with the skin of another player is {{cmd|1=give @s minecraft:player_head[minecraft:profile={name:PlayerName}]}}. This command will give a dynamic player head, which will update when the player updates their skin. A static player head instead saves the skin of the player from the time it was created, meaning if the player changes their skin, the head still displays the original texture.<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|464414369452142592|Skulls are a snapshot of the skin as it was made; just change your skin, make a skull, and change your skin back. That's intended behaviour.|May 8, 2014}}</ref> The command to get a static player is twofold: first type {{cmd|1=fetchprofile name PlayerName}}, then click on the "Give Item" option to give yourself a static player head of the player named.

Note that it is therefore necessary to be connected to the internet to load the texture of a skin, whatever the property used.
When they are loaded for the first time by the client, the skins textures are cached in {{code|[[.minecraft]]\assets\skins\(subfolders)\(files)}}.
If the client does not have access to the internet when it first loads, the player's head displays a regular head (Steve's skin) which is also cached.
Afterward, even if the client reconnects to the internet, in order to display the skin correctly, it is necessary to clear the cache manually by deleting the recently created files in {{code|[[.minecraft]]\assets\skins\(subfolder)}}, then restarting the game.

=== Marc's Head Format ===
[[File:Allmobheads.png|thumb|right|All of the MHF mob heads.]]

{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}

[[Marc Watson]] created a number of accounts with specific skins so map makers could use common player heads without the risk of someone changing their skins.<ref>{{reddit|1m0itx/twitter_marc_irl_mapmakers_would_it_be_useful|cc4m1cq|I'm here to make it so that people don't have to worry about having a consistent account whose skin might change.|Marc_IRL|September 9, 2013}}</ref> Nowadays, since heads do not update the skin if a player changes their skin, this is not something map-makers need to worry about, though these skins are still useful. These accounts have names in the format <code>MHF_<''name''></code>, for example <code>MHF_PigZombie</code> is the name of a ''Minecraft'' user with a [[zombified piglin]] head. MHF stands for "Marc's Head Format".<ref>{{tweet|Marc_IRL|377453670410891264|head format. I needed to pick a prefix that was short and not already taken by other usernames.|September 10, 2013}}</ref> There are also a few blocks and "bonus" heads, for more variety. These player heads have not been updated in compliance with the [[Texture Update]], and are outdated.

Because these are names of player accounts, these player heads are obtained or placed using the <code>minecraft:profile</code> component, for instance: {{cmd|1=/give @s minecraft:player_head[minecraft:profile=MHF_<name>]}}.

The following names/heads have been made available:<ref>{{tweet|Marc_IRL|542330244473311232|For those following the MHF list, I have presents for you. Full list of accounts I've made: http://pastebin.com/5mug6EBu|December 9, 2014}}</ref>
