'''Rendering''' refers to the process of converting digital information to a form which can be displayed via a visual output such as a computer monitor. This is often done using dedicated rendering engines such as [[Blaze3D]], or rendering pipelines such as [[RenderDragon]].

=== World terrain ===
Blocks comprising the world are defined via block [[model]] files. Each model defines "quads", which are often planar rectangles. Each quad is comprised of two triangles. Fluids are also defined geometrically using quads; in this case, they are not necessarily coplanar.

Triangles are defined by three vertices, and have a direction in which to render. Rendering is done by means of a fragment shader.

How blocks render depends on the render type of each block. There are five options: solid, cutout, cutout mipped, translucent, and tripwire.
