A '''zombie''' is a common [[undead]] type of [[hostile mob]] that deals melee damage and drops [[rotten flesh]] on death.
{{TOC limit|3}}

== Spawning ==
=== Natural generation ===
Zombies may spawn in the [[Overworld]] in groups of four in ''[[Java Edition]]'' or in groups of 2-4 in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' above [[solid block]]s in a [[light]] level of 0, except in [[mushroom fields]] and [[deep dark]] biomes. {{IN|Bedrock}}, zombies also do not spawn in [[river]]s, [[frozen river]]s, and [[snowy plains]]. All zombie variants (including babies) require a 2-block tall space to spawn.

Zombies spawned in [[desert]] biomes exposed to the sky have a likelihood of 80%{{only|java|short=1}}/70%{{only|bedrock|short=1}} to be replaced by [[husk]]s. Zombies that are not husks or [[drowned]] have a 5% chance to spawn as [[zombie villager]]s. Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn as babies. Baby zombies then have a 4.75% chance of spawning as [[chicken jockey]]s,{{only|java|short=1}} or a 15% chance to be able to ride certain mobs{{only|bedrock|short=1}}.  

Zombies and their variants spawn with random values of [[knockback resistance]] between 0% and 5%. 

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Sieges ===
{{main|Zombie siege}}
{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
If a [[player]] is near a [[village]] at midnight, up to 20 zombies may be spawned in the village in accordance with mob spawning rules. The spawning can even happen in [[mushroom fields]] biome if the triggering player is in an adjacent biome. Zombies spawned as a part of a siege are always regular zombies; [[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s and [[drowned]] never spawn as a part of a siege, even in their respective [[biome]]s.

=== Monster spawners ===
Inside [[monster room]]s, zombies may have a chance to spawn from a [[monster spawner]]. Zombie monster spawners are found in 50% of monster rooms. Zombies spawned from a monster spawner never spawn as [[zombie villager]]s.

=== Trial spawners ===
Adult zombies have a {{frac|1|3}} chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].

Baby zombies have a {{frac|1|4}} chance to be selected as the "small melee" mob for [[trial spawner]]s.

=== Husks ===
When a [[husk]]'s head is submerged in [[water]] for over 30 seconds, the husk starts transforming into a zombie, with a new entity [[UUID]]. The husk's equipment remains on the zombie after conversion.{{only|java|short=1}} The zombie transforms into a [[drowned]] if its head remains submerged.

=== Reinforcements===
{{main|#Reinforcements 2|title1= § Reinforcements}}{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
On Hard [[difficulty]], all zombies have a 0-10% chance to spawn other zombies as reinforcements.  

Zombies cannot spawn zombie villagers as reinforcements, despite their natural generation spawn chances being 5%. However, zombie villagers ''can'' spawn other zombie villagers as reinforcements.

=== Zombie horsemen ===
{{main|Zombie Horse#Spawning}}
When a [[zombie horse]] spawns naturally, it will always spawn with a zombie rider holding an [[iron spear]].

== Variants ==
=== Baby zombies ===
{{Dungeons hatnote|type=mob|Baby Zombie}}
[[File:Chicken Jockey.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Baby zombie riding a chicken, known as a [[chicken jockey]].]]
Baby zombies make up 5% of zombie spawns. They behave similarly to regular zombies, with the following differences:
* They are much faster than normal zombies, yet they have the same [[health]].
* The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie [[sound]] effects.
* Worn [[armor]] shrinks to fit their body size.
* They are able to fit through 1×1 [[block]] gaps.
* They give 12 [[experience]] points when killed by the player or a tamed wolf instead of 5.
* Unlike most other baby mobs, they remain babies indefinitely and never become adult zombies.
* They have a decreased hitbox size.

==== Jockeys ====
{{Main|Chicken Jockey|Jockey}}
{{IN|JE}}, every baby zombie has a chance to spawn as a chicken jockey. In a [[chicken]]-free environment, each baby has a 4.75% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey, for a total 0.2375% chance for each spawned zombie of spawning as a chicken jockey; if chickens are present, the chance increases to 0.4875%.

{{IN|bedrock}}, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombies can start riding a mob and become a [[jockey]] after it spawns. A jockey mob ridden by a baby zombie will adapt to the speed of its rider. A baby zombie can ride:

=== Geared zombies ===
{{Main|Geared mobs}}
Some zombies spawn wearing [[armor]] or holding weapons, both of which may be [[enchant]]ed. In addition, zombies may also spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. The chances of each of these events occurring are listed below. If a zombie spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material). Zombies cannot naturally spawn with [[netherite]] armor.

{{IN|java}}, the armor is not damaged by any damage source; it cannot "wear out" the way [[player]] armor does. [[Helmet]]s (not [[block]]s like [[carved pumpkin]]s) on zombies can break if the zombie is exposed to daylight. {{IN|bedrock}}, any armor piece is damaged as if the player is wearing it.{{Verify|Does this happen in other editions, not including Java?}}

Zombies also have a natural armor rating of {{armor|2}}, giving 1.6 to 8% damage reduction from [[Armor#Effects|most sources]]. Zombies can also wear mob [[heads]], although they need to be dropped by the player before the zombie can pick one up and put it on.

On {{w|Halloween}}, zombies {{in|java}} may spawn wearing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]]. They are never dropped, even when the zombies are killed with [[Looting]].

}}

==== Taken equipment ====
When a zombie dies, all of its picked-up equipment drops without changing the damage that has accumulated on it {{In|je}}. {{IN|be}}, the armor's durability is still vulnerable to attacks, as if a player is wearing it.

==== Naturally-spawned equipment ====
Zombies have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment and drop it with a random durability. Each level of [[Looting]] increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). They cannot drop the [[diamond sword]]s that they occasionally wield during [[ominous trial]]s. These items include:
* {{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}} (sometimes [[enchanted]])
* {{ItemLink|Iron Sword}} (sometimes [[enchanted]])
* {{ItemLink|Iron Spear}} (sometimes [[enchanted]])
* {{ItemLink|Diamond Sword}} (in [[ominous trial]]s)
* {{ItemLink|Iron Chestplate|Random Armor|link=Armor}} (sometimes [[enchanted]], made from leather, copper, gold, chainmail, iron or diamond)

Additionally, {{in|bedrock}}, all naturally spawned equipment always drops at full durability when the zombie converts to a [[drowned]].

==== Experience ====
Adult zombies drop {{xp|5}} and baby zombies drop {{xp|12}} when they are killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]]. Any zombie that spawns with equipment drops another {{xp|1|3}} per item when killed.

== Behavior ==
=== Attacking ===
==== Attacking the player ====
Zombies pursue the player on sight from 35 blocks away, raising their arms up higher {{in|java}}. The detection range of zombies is reduced to half of their normal range (17.5 blocks) while the player wears a zombie [[head]]. {{IN|je}}, if a zombie sees a player and a villager together, the zombie prefers to attack the player, and continues chasing the player while ignoring other villagers. {{IN|be}}, zombies prioritize the nearest player, villager, or golem.

Zombies periodically make groaning sounds, which can be heard up to 16 blocks away. Zombies attempt to avoid obstacles, including fall [[damage]], [[fire]], [[lava]], [[magma blocks]], and [[cactus]] and try to find the shortest path toward the player.<ref>{{ytl|3aDYJZLmtxQ}}</ref> Unlike [[skeleton]]s, zombies do not try to avoid being hit and continue to pursue the player even when being attacked.

==== Attacking turtles ====
Zombies attack baby [[turtle]]s and actively seek out and destroy [[turtle egg]]s within 24 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, by jumping on them until they crack and break.

==== Attacking golems ====
Zombies pursue and attack only iron golems within 42 blocks; zombies ignore snow golems unless attacked. Iron golems and snow golems attack zombies without provocation, although snow golems deal only knockback to zombies with their snowballs.

==== Attacking villagers ====
Zombies target [[villager]]s within a 35- to 52.5-block radius (depending on [[regional difficulty]] {{in|java}}) or just 35-block radius {{in|bedrock}}, and they can always see villagers through walls. If a zombie is attacking a villager and sees the player, it interrupts its attack on the villager to attack the player instead, even if the player has not attacked it.{{only|je|short=1}} Once a zombie has targeted a villager, the zombie ignores any other villagers and the [[player]], until its target is dead, the zombie is attacked or the player moves too close to the zombie.{{only|be|short=1}}

Any zombie variant can transform a villager into a zombie villager. The probability depends on the [[difficulty]]:
* 0% chance in [[Peaceful]] (no zombies spawn) and [[Easy]]
* 50% chance in [[Normal]]
* 100% chance in [[Hard]]

==== Attacking wandering traders ====
Zombies target [[wandering trader]]s within 35 blocks and can see traders through walls. The zombie focuses solely on the trader unless it's attacked, or if either it or the target is killed or moved out of range, or if the trader is under the [[invisibility]] status effect.
[[File:A Zombie Breaking Down a Door.png|thumb|A zombie breaking down a wooden oak door. The zombie can break only the top half of the door, not the bottom half.]]

==== Weapon damage ====
A zombie holding a weapon adds the weapon's damage to its normal melee damage. For example, a zombie holding an iron shovel on Normal difficulty deals {{hp|3}} from its punch + {{hp|3.5}} from the shovel for a total of {{hp|6.5}}. (it should be noted that, {{in|java}}, damage values shown when hovering over weapons in the inventory include the player's {{hp|1}} base melee damage, so an iron shovel shows up as {{hp|4.5}}; subtracting 1 gives the actual weapon's damage.) The zombie's weapon damage is scaled by difficulty: if the zombie would deal X damage on Normal, it deals 1.5 * X on Hard and 0.5 * X + 1 on Easy. So for example a zombie with an iron shovel deals 1.5 * 6.5 = {{hp|9.75}} on Hard and 0.5 * 6.5 + 1 = {{hp|4.25}} on Easy. Enchantments add their damage as normal before difficulty scaling.

=== Burning under daylight ===
Zombies burn when exposed to direct sunlight starting 27 seconds (540 ticks) before the beginning of a new day. Burning is suppressed when the zombie is:
* under an area with a [[Light#Mobs|sunlight level]] of 14 or less
* in water
* wearing head [[armor]] (the helmet has a 50% chance to lose 1 durability for every tick the zombie would normally be set on fire)
* under the status effect of [[Fire Resistance]]
* standing in cobwebs.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|62182|Webs block sunlight from burning skeletons and zombies|date=July 16, 2014}}</ref>

Transparent blocks, such as [[glass]], do not prevent them from burning.

If they attack an [[entity]] while burning, they may set it on fire, with a <code>(30 × [[regional difficulty]])%</code> chance and with a <code>2 × floor([[regional difficulty]])</code> second duration{{only|je|short=1}}.

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

=== Picking up items ===
{{main|Geared mobs#Picking up gear}}
Some zombies are capable of automatically picking up dropped items that they come across. [[Mob head]]s and [[carved pumpkin]]s are automatically worn on their heads. Zombies can equip [[armor]], [[weapon]]s or [[tool]]s. If a zombie encounters another similar [[item]], it may drop the previous item in favor of the new one if:
* both items are armor/weapons and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces higher damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords) ''without considering enchantments'',
* both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not{{only|je|short=1}} or the new item is less [[Durability|damaged]] than the old item, or
* both items are [[bow]]s and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.

For example, a zombie can pick up a [[totem of undying]], which cannot be retrieved by killing the zombie because that would activate the totem. However, the zombie would drop the totem in favor of a sword or armor.

Items dropped by mobs in exchange for another cannot be picked up by players or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by [[hopper]]s.

A zombie holding a picked-up [[item]] does not despawn when left alone, similar to being [[name tag]]ged.

Zombies have a higher chance of being able to pick up items in Hard [[difficulty]].

Picked-up items do not cause the zombie to drop more experience when killed, unlike naturally-spawned gear.

=== Breaking doors ===
[[File:Zombie ways.png|thumb|A zombie choosing to break the [[door]] down instead of taking an alternative path.]]
Up to 10% of zombies (depending on [[regional difficulty]] {{in|java}}) in pursuit of a target can pathfind through closed [[Wooden Door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s, and on Hard (and [[Hardcore]]) difficulty can succeed in breaking them down. Zombies can break only the top half of a door, meaning they cannot break a door if the zombie is facing the bottom half of the door.

=== Reinforcements ===
{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
On all difficulty levels, damaged zombie mobs (including zombie villagers, husks, drowned and even [[zombified piglin]]s<ref name="MC-14800">{{bug|MC-14800||When zombie villagers, husks, drowned or zombified piglins are damaged, they spawn regular zombie reinforcements|resolution=Fixed}}</ref>) call all other zombie mobs of the same type within a 67×21×67 to 111×21×111 area<ref group="n">The radius is based on the <code>follow_range</code> stat: base value is 35, ±5% random spawn bonus, then plus 0–50% random zombie-spawn bonus</ref> centered on the attacked zombie to target the attacker.

In Hard difficulty, zombie mobs can spawn additional zombie mobs of the same type to "help" when damaged while targeting a player or other entity. Each mob has a "likeliness to call reinforcements" statistic ranging from 0–10%, and "leader" zombie mobs (0–5% depending on [[regional difficulty]]) get a bonus of 50–75 percentage points to the stat. When the mob is damaged by an entity or is damaged while targeting an entity, up to 50 attempts are made to randomly choose a spawn location (0 or ±7–40 blocks away in all three axes) that is above a block with a solid top surface, has light level 0, has no players within 7 blocks, and has no colliding entities or blocks at which to spawn the reinforcement. They spawn on the north-west corner of the designated block, instead of the center of the block like natural mob spawning does.<ref>{{bug|MC-114016||Reinforcement zombies are not centered on a block}}</ref> Meaning that they can spawn in locations that the natural spawning rules would not allow, such as inside [[Iron Chain|chain]] blocks, although the designated block cannot be a non-solid block that would prevent usual mob spawning like [[redstone dust]] or [[pressure plate]]s. Reinforcements can spawn even in biomes where the mob can't spawn naturally, like [[mushroom fields]], [[the End]], and [[the Nether]]<ref>{{bug|MC-227735||Zombie reinforcements can spawn on biomes where regular zombies can't|WAI}}</ref>.

Both the damaged mob and the new mob has a 5 percentage point penalty to their "likeliness to call reinforcement" stat, preventing infinite zombie mobs from spawning this way.

Additionally, reinforcements do not spawn at all, even on Hard difficulty, if the [[game rule]] {{cd|doMobSpawning}} is set to <code>false</code>.

Leader zombie mobs are a special type of that mob that spawn with an added 50–75% chance to spawn reinforcements. The chance of a leader spawning increases with clamped regional difficulty, up to a 5% chance of spawning. Leaders can also spawn with up to 100 max health, but due to a bug they do not spawn with more than 20 health points.{{until|JE 26.1}}

Reinforcements spawn regardless of the [[Mob spawning#Java Edition mob cap|hostile mob cap]]. Mobs spawned as reinforcements will be of the same type of zombie<ref name="MC-14800" /> (i.e. zombie villagers only call upon other zombie villagers) but they can be babies, including chicken jockeys. They also respect spawning requirements for the specific zombie type, meaning [[husk]] reinforcements can only spawn under the sky, [[drowned]] reinforcements may only spawn in water, and zombified piglin reinforcements cannot spawn on [[nether wart block]]s.

=== Becoming drowned ===
[[File:Husk becoming Zombie.gif|thumb|upright|A [[husk]] that suffocates in water converts to a zombie.]]
[[File:Zombie becoming Drowned.gif|thumb|upright|A zombie that suffocates in water converts into a [[drowned]].]]
If a zombie's head is submerged in water for 30 seconds, it begins converting into a [[drowned]]. The zombie shakes, similar to a zombie villager being cured and, after 15 seconds, the zombie becomes drowned. Once this process starts, it cannot be stopped even if the zombie leaves water. This time is not affected by the [[Respiration]] enchantment or the [[Water Breathing]] status effect. 

A newly-converted drowned always has full health even if converted from a damaged zombie.

An item being held or worn by a zombie when it becomes drowned, whether it was picked up or naturally spawned, has a 100% drop rate, which includes any naturally spawned equipment dropping with full durability.{{only|be|short=1}}

Only normal zombies can become drowned; [[zombie villager]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s cannot be converted.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|127298|Zombie Villagers and Zombie Pigmans don't turn into Drowned|date=March 14, 2018}}</ref> [[Husk]]s, however, convert into zombies if they drown, and then they convert into a [[drowned]] as does a normal zombie. Any husks that convert into zombies also have full health, even if the drowned husk is damaged.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Zombie.png|thumb|width=165x165|An unarmed zombie ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult zombie to form a [[jockey]].
