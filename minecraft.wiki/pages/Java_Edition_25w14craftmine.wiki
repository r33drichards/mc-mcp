'''25w14craftmine''', supposedly the first and only snapshot for the '''Craftmine Update''', is an [[April Fools' Day jokes|April Fools' Day joke snapshot]] for ''[[Java Edition]]'', released on April 1, 2025.<ref>{{mcnet|the-craftmine-update|The Craftmine Update {{!}} Minecraft|April 1, 2025}}</ref> This snapshot is a fork of [[Java Edition 1.21.5 Release Candidate 1|1.21.5 Release Candidate 1]].

25w14craftmine spawns the player next to a [[mine crafter]]. The mine crafter can craft "mines" using [[mine ingredient]]s which change different properties of the mine. Entering a mine brings the player to a new dimension. The mine is won if the player successfully finds and uses a [[mine exit]] and the mine is lost if the player dies. Winning a mine grants the player experience points which can be used to purchase [[player unlock]]s that grant the player new powers. Every 5th mine is a [[special mine|special event mine]] that will grant a [[shimmering key]] if won. Shimmering keys can be used on [[shimmering door]]s in the Overworld to unlock new rooms.

=== Blocks ===
[[File:Dimension control.gif|40px]] '''[[Dimension Control]]'''
* Used to change the style of the sky with the sky box item.

[[File:Mine Crafter.gif|40px]] '''[[Mine Crafter]]'''
* Used for generating custom mines.
* Can be leveled up to unlock new mine ingredient slots. The mine crafter level is stored per world so the level will be the same in all mine crafters.
* The mine ingredient slots cap at 50, achieved at level 48.
* Cannot be mined.
* Can be destroyed by explosions and has a chance to drop as an item when exploded.

[[File:Mine Revisitor.gif|40px]] '''[[Mine Revisitor]]'''
* Used to enter already generated mines after making a new mine with the mine crafter.
* Cannot be mined or exploded.

[[File:Mine Travelling Block JE1.gif|40px]] '''[[Mine Travelling Block]]'''

* Can only be found on a [[mine exit]] structure or on top of a [[mine crafter]] or [[mine revisitor]].

* Although most other blocks and items are in the creative menu, this can only be obtained with commands.

*Used to travel to the mine contained in the mine crafter or mine revisitor.

[[File:Sky (April Fools' joke).png|40px]][[File:Hub Sky (April Fools' joke).png|40px]][[File:Day Sky (April Fools' joke).png|40px]] '''[[Sky (block)|Sky]]'''
* Spawns naturally in the the hub dimension.
* Has the texture of the current sky box.
* Cannot be broken naturally without creative mode or commands.

[[File:Shimmering Door.webp|40px]] '''[[Shimmering Door]]'''
*When using the door, "'''Doors yearn for keys!'''" shows up in the [[action bar]], and the door does not open.
*When right-clicking the door with a shimmering key in hand, the player can generate new rooms in the hub area.
** These rooms can contain structures such as [[village]] houses and [[end ship]]s.

[[File:Trophy (April Fools' joke).png|40px]] '''[[Trophy (April Fools' joke)|Trophy]]'''
* Awarded to the player for particular actions and achievements.

'''[[File:Grass Mob Trophy.png|40px]] [[Mob Trophy]]'''
* There is a 10% chance a mob will drop a trophy when killed by a player.
* Trophies will be transported to the [[Hub]] upon successful completion of a mine, as long as they are in the player's inventory and not inside a container (i.e. a [[bundle]]).
* Every mob trophy has a grade:
** 100/181 ≈ 55.2% chance of grass grade
** 50/181 ≈ 27.6% chance of stone grade
** 25/181 ≈ 13.8% chance of gold grade
** 5/181 ≈ 2.8% chance of diamond grade
** 1/181 ≈ 0.6% chance of netherite grade
* Additionally, there is a 1% chance that a mob trophy will be shiny.
* The rarest mob trophy, a shiny netherite grade mob trophy, has only a 1/181,000 ≈ 0.0006% chance of dropping from any mob kill.
* Trophies can also be obtained with the give command, using components to display specific mobs. Below is an example command to spawn a shiny, netherite-grade ender dragon mob trophy:
** <code>/give @s minecraft:mob_trophy[minecraft:mob_trophy/type={shiny:1b,type:"ender_dragon"},minecraft:block_state={grade:"netherite"}]</code>
** The tag <code>shiny:1b</code> will give the trophy the 'shiny' trait. Replace with <code>shiny:0b</code> to remove shininess.
** The tag <code>{grade:"netherite"}</code> will make the trophy netherite-grade.
** The tag <code>type:"ender_dragon"</code> will set the trophy's mob to an [[ender dragon]].
* Right-clicking a mob trophy will play a random sound that the mob makes.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Debug_Stick.gif|40px]] [[Displacement Wand]]'''
* Uses the [[stick]] texture with an enchantment glint (similar to the [[debug stick]]).
* Shoots an [[ender pearl]] when right-clicking in hand.

'''[[File:Eye of Exit.png|40px]] [[Eye of Exit]]'''
* The item's texture and usage are similar to an [[eye of ender]]; the eye of exit instead locates the nearest exit portal of the current mine. They are crafted by surrounding one iron ingot with eight copper ingots in a crafting table. The player unlocks the advancement "Spy Eye" for crafting one. Upon using an eye of exit, it will damage the player (unless the upgrade that prevents this is owned), and floats in the air to indicate the direction of the exit portal.
* The eye of exit replaces the eye of ender in all crafting recipes.
* The eye of exit cannot be used in any special mine.

'''[[File:Fire Wand.gif|40px]] [[Fire Wand]]'''

'''[[File:Mine.png|40px]] [[Mine (item)|Mine]]'''
* Represents the upcoming mine after the player adds one or more mine ingredient(s) inside the [[mine crafter]].
* Every 5th mine is unalterable and instead creates a [[special mine]].

'''[[File:Mine Ingredient.png|40px]] [[Mine Ingredient]]'''
* Used when crafting mines.
* Unlock options in the [[mine crafter]] when in the inventory as a player leaves a mine. Must not be inside a container (i.e. a [[bundle]]) to register.
* Obtained through various actions. While intended to only be found within mines, ingredients can be obtained in the hub and will be unlocked normally upon interaction with the mine crafter.
* To get custom mine ingredients, use these following commands:
** First, give yourself a <code>mine_ingredient</code> using the /give command. To do this, type in <code>/give @s mine_ingredient</code>.
** Next, drop the item on the ground far away from you
** Lastly, use this command. This one is for eternal night, to change it, type in the new ID below in the place of the old one, now type the command and you should get a mine ingredient that isn't eternal night.
*** <code>/data merge entity @e[type=item,distance=..10,limit=1,sort=nearest] {Item: {components: {"minecraft:world_effect_unlock": {}, "minecraft:world_modifiers": {effects: ["minecraft:eternal_night"], include_description: 1b} } } }</code>

* Used inside the dimension control block to set the appearance of the sky in the current dimension.

'''[[File:Shazboots.png|40px]] [[Shazboots!]]'''
* When worn, the player will increasingly gain speed depending on how long the jump button is held, and then gives a proportional upwards boost when jump is released.

'''[[File:Wind Wand.gif|40px]] [[Wind Wand]]'''
* Uses the [[breeze rod]] texture with an enchantment glint.
* Shoots a [[wind charge]] when right-clicking in hand.

 <nowiki>/summon item ~ ~ ~ {Item:{id:"minecraft:shimmering_key",Count:1,components:{"minecraft:instant_room":{"structure":"<room ID>"}}}}</nowiki>
Where <code><room ID></code> should be replaced with one of the following strings:

barrels, boiler, carpet, corridor_simple, fountain, grassy_h, hanging, house, labyrinth, pool, ship, stairs, storage1, storage2, sugar_h, test, tree, trophy, tunnel, useless, wheat_h, workshop

=== Special Events ===
[[Special mine|Special events]] are mines with unique additions. There are nine different special events.

'''Warden special event'''
* Spawns the player near an arena with a sleeping [[warden]] and an audience of spectator villagers
* Mine exit appears when the warden is killed, or a sequence of actions is performed by the player:
** Use a [[goat horn]] (can be found in a chest in the building behind the warden)
** Play a [[music disc]] in a [[jukebox]] (found in a different chest in the building)
** Activate a [[copper bulb]] (there is one in the building which controls the light show)
** Equip a [[mob head]] (also in the goat horn chest)
** Set off a [[firework]] (there are firework launchers on the roof)
* These steps must be done in this order, or it will not count. For example, if you're already wearing the mob head before you activate the lights, you'll need to take it off and put it back on again.
* Hints will be shown for what step to do next, however on a multiplayer server they will only appear for one player. Due to a bug, the hint for the fireworks does not appear.
* If the warden is attacked, or you wait too long before doing the next step in the chain, it will become hostile and you will need to kill it to win.
* Once the whole sequence is complete, the player is rewarded with 5 [[diamond]]s, and 200 stacks of [[rose bush]]es.

'''Enderman special event'''
* Generally spawns a user in a desert biome at night. 
* Spawns a wave of a single enderman
* Mine exit appears when the enderman is killed

'''Ender Dragon special event'''
* The [[ender dragon]], [[end fountain]], and [[obsidian pillars]] spawn here
* Mine exit appears when the ender dragon is killed. The [[credits]] do not play.
'''Spooky Scary Skeletons special event'''
* Generally spawns the player in a desert with cave generation.
* Three waves of [[skeleton]]s spawn. During the second and third waves, [[wither skeleton]]s also spawn. After all three waves are completed, an exit appears.
'''Kuiper World special event'''
* Many small icy islands floating in space (some with spruce trees)
* [[Snow golem]]s, [[polar bear]]s and snowy [[fox]]es spawn on the islands
* Player spawns on an island with an igloo
* In the basement of the igloo, the chest contents have been replaced to include a diamond shovel that can be used to get snowballs for bridging
* Also contained in the basement of the igloo is a diamond pickaxe, a water bucket and a lava bucket, everything required to make a basic [[Tutorial:Cobblestone farming|cobblestone generator]]

'''Small but Deadly special event'''
* Three waves of mobs spawn. From the first wave, 25 [[silverfish]] spawn. From the second wave, 3 [[baby zombie]]s spawn. On the third wave, 3 [[vex]]es spawn, and also 5 additional silverfish and 1 additional baby zombie. After all three waves are completed, an exit appears.
* The world is mountainous with the [[windswept gravelly hills]], [[desert]], [[mangrove swamp]], [[crimson forest]] and [[warped forest]] biomes.

'''Angry Ghast special event'''
* [[Angry ghast]] boss spawns after countdown

'''Wither special event'''

'''Raid special event'''

* The player spawns in a plains village with the [[Raid Omen]] effect, which will start a [[raid]].
* After the raid is completed, the exit will appear in addition to gaining the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.

=== General ===

== Changes ==
This snapshot completely overhauls the game. Instead of spawning in normal overworld, upon creating a world the player spawns in a hub biome inside the overworld with no terrain generated around the spawn other than the place where the player spawns in. The place is centered around a [[mine crafter|Mine Crafter]]. On interacting with the Mine Crafter, a window vaguely similar to that of a crafting table opens. The player can use this interface to create “Mines”, sub worlds with customizable features that the player unlocks through gameplay in the mines. Upon successfully leaving a mine through a [[Mine Exit]], the player is rewarded with experience based on the value and amount of items they have in their inventory. The inventory is separate between different mines, but starting equipment may be purchased with experience levels. The player can also use experience to buy other upgrades (referred to as “unlocks” in-game), such as more inventory space, increased speed, etc. All of these changes effectively transform the game into a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rogue-lite ''roguelite'']. Other significant changes to aspects of the game are:
* The player cannot craft in any traditional manner (inventory, crafting table) until the ability is unlocked, and must rely on a crafter to craft items.
* Worlds can no longer be created in [[Creative]]. The gamemode can still be selected through use of commands.
* The main menu logo has been changed to "Craftmine" in place of "Minecraft".

* No longer teleports players to the [[The End|End]].
* Cannot be generated naturally, as end portal frames have been removed.

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* The original splash texts have been replaced with the following entries:
** Mine, you fools!
*** This is a reference to a memorable line from The Lord of the Rings.

== Trivia ==
* This version has no [[panorama]].
* The loading screen is black by default.
* The menu is a reference to ''[[w:The Matrix|The Matrix]]''.
* The text that appears in the background is a mix of the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]] and [[Illageralt]], with the exception of a creeper face. Illageralt is a language that appears often in ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]''.

* The End portal frame textures exist in the game files despite them being removed from this version.
