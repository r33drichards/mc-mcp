The '''pet creeper''' is a pet variant of the [[creeper]] introduced in [[25w14craftmine]].

== Spawning ==
A pet creeper spawns next to the player on [[Mine (dimension)|mine]] start when the "Pet Creeper" [[Player Unlock]] is active.

== Drops ==
Pet creeper drops nothing when it's killed.

== Behavior ==
The pet creeper is similar to the regular [[creeper]], but there are still some differences:
*The [[player]]'s [[melee attack]] can't damage the pet creeper.
*The pet creeper doesn't chase players in [[Survival]] mode.
*The pet creeper doesn't [[Explosion|explode]] when it is near a target.
*The pet creeper doesn't escape from [[cat]], [[ocelot]] or cat in [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine|25w14craftmine]].
*The pet creeper doesn't become a [[charged creeper]] when it is struck by [[lightning]].
