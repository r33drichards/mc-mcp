'''Mounts of Mayhem''' (stylized as '''MOUNTS OF MAYHEM''') is an official trailer for [[Mounts of Mayhem]].

== Summary ==
In a [[badlands]] biome, [[Alex]] is seen riding a horse, scaring an [[armadillo]] as they rush by it. They are seen chased by a group of five [[camel husk jockey]]s, and a [[parched]] attempts shooting an arrow at Alex only to miss. Alex then blows their [[goat horn]] and stops near a wooded biome, not knowing what to do while the jockeys are coming to them. Soon, they hear the blaring of a horn, unsheath their [[diamond sword]] and ride toward the jockeys, with their friends ([[Efe]], [[Kai]], [[Sunny]], and [[Zuri]]) by their side, all the four wielding [[iron spear]]s. Between the sides, a [[pig]] gets panicked as both sides start fighting. Efe takes down the [[husk]] and parched on a [[camel husk]] with their spear, and tells Zuri to do the same on another camel husk jockey. Soon after, Efe notices the sun setting as five [[zombie horsemen]] arrive to attack the two riders. [[Kai]] falls from their horse and runs away from a zombie horseman chasing them. A gliding [[Noor]] then rushes by and instantly takes down the zombie rider. Alex on their horse passing by quickly causes Kai to fall into a lake, finding themselves in front of five [[zombie nautilus jockey]]s preparing to attack them. Kai then finds a [[nautilus]] and rides it to come back to safety, petting it before coming back to the surface and again falling into the lake by a running camel husk. The camera then shifts to the other riders continuing the fight before Kai spots a lone [[zombie horse]] and the pig from earlier, offering them a [[potato]] only for the animals to refuse. All the riders meet at one point, including Kai on the pig, before facing down an army of camel husk jockeys, zombie horsemen, [[spider jockey]]s, and [[chicken jockey]]s. Alex then blows their goat horn and all the group starts fighting the monster army.
