A '''potato of knowledge''' is a joke [[item]], added in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
[[Big brain]]s mined by a player in Survival, or destroyed by an [[explosion]], drop a potato of knowledge with the same amount of experience stored in it (If the big brain didn't have any experience, a potato with 0 knowledge is dropped). The maximum possible amount stored in a single potato of knowledge is equal to 1000 experience points; if a big brain absorbs this much experience, a potato of knowledge with 1000 experience is dropped by it automatically, without breaking the block.

In the [[Creative inventory]], three preset types are available: potatoes with 10, 50 and 100 experience.

== Usage ==
Players can {{control|use}} the item to consume it. Potatoes of knowledge doesn't restore any hunger when consumed; instead, it gives the player the amount of experience that it stored. Because this item is not actually food, it doesn't count for the "Husbandry" [[advancement]].

It also doesn't inflict the Poison effect, despite using the [[Poisonous Potato|poisonous potato]] texture.
