'''Wheat seeds''' are [[item]]s obtained by breaking [[grass]], or more abundantly harvested from wheat crops, and are used to plant them.

'''Wheat crops''' are planted in [[farmland]] and used to grow [[wheat]] and wheat seeds.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Wheat seeds can be obtained from breaking [[short grass]], [[tall grass]], [[fern]] or [[large fern]], which have a 12.5% chance to yield 1 seed. If harvested with a tool enchanted with [[Fortune]], the drop rate is increased to 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III.

Harvesting fully-grown crops yields 1 unit of [[wheat]] and between 1 and 4 seeds (about {{frac|2|5|7}} seeds/crop harvested on average) {{in|java}}, or between 0 and 3 seeds {{in|bedrock}}.

{{Breaking row|Wheat|link=none|horizontal=1}}

The looting is calculated by a binomial distribution: a drop is attempted three times with a success rate of around 57% to yield the 1–4{{Only|Java}} or 0–3{{Only|Bedrock}} drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.

=== Natural generation ===
[[Village]] farm plots have a chance of being wheat crops. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:

{| class="wikitable"
! Village style !! Chance
|-
| {{EnvSprite|savanna-village}} Savanna || 80%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|desert-village}} Desert || 70%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|taiga-village}} Taiga || 60%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|plains-village}} Plains || 50%
|-
| {{EnvSprite|snowy-village}} Snowy || 20%
|}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|wheat-seeds}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell wheat seeds for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Villager gifts ===
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Nitwit and unemployed [[villager]]s throw wheat seeds at players under the [[Hero of the Village]] effect.

== Usage ==

=== Crop ===
{{main|Tutorial:Crop farming|title1=Crop farming}}

[[File:Crop states.png|thumb|Different stages of crop growth.]]

Wheat seeds can be placed on [[farmland]] by right-clicking, where they grow through eight stages. When left alone, wheat seeds planted on farmland grow to become wheat crops, which can be harvested by the player. Seeds require a light level of 8 or greater to plant{{only|java}} and 9 or greater to grow. {{IN|Bedrock}} they can be planted at any light level but need an [[Light#Internal light level|internal light level]] of 9 to grow. 

Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted on is [[hydrated]]. Using [[bone meal]] on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5.

Breaking the final stage produces 1 to 4 wheat seeds (or more with Fortune) and 1 [[wheat]]. If they are harvested early, they drop 1 seed without any wheat. Crops break if pushed by a [[piston]] or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (e.g. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

=== Breeding ===
Like other seeds, wheat seeds can be used to breed [[chicken]]s and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby chickens by 10%. Chickens also follow a player holding wheat seeds.

=== Taming ===
Like other seeds, wheat seeds can be used to tame [[parrot]]s.

=== Composting ===
Placing wheat seeds into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of wheat seeds yields an average of 2.74 [[bone meal]].
