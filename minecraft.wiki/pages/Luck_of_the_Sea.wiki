== Obtaining ==
Luck of the Sea can be obtained from [[enchanting tables]], drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]],{{only|bedrock}} books obtained by [[fishing]], [[monster room]] chests, librarian [[villager]]s, non-village [[structure]] loot, and already on a fishing rod through fishing.

== Usage ==
