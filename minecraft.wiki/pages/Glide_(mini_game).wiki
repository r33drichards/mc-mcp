'''Glide'''<ref>{{Mcnet|glide-mini-game-consoles-tomorrow|Glide Mini Game on Consoles Tomorrow|March 27, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref> is a [[mini game]] where players maneuver through a track while wearing an [[elytra]], aiming to finish in the fastest time or score the most points by flying through colored rings. Glide was added to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] on March 28, 2017 (March 29, 2017 for ''Wii U Edition''). 

== Description ==
[[File:Glide.png|300px|thumb|Gameplay of the Glide mini game.]]
Glide features two different game modes:

* Time attack - Players compete to finish a track in the fastest time.
* Score attack - Players compete to score the highest number of points by flying through colored rings placed along the track. Green rings give 3 points, yellow rings give 5 points and blue rings give 7 points. 

A Glide match is divided into three rounds, where a player with the fastest time or highest score from any round is the victor. Each map has checkpoints with two beacon beams. The player has 3 hearts of health. When losing all 3 hearts of health you die. Hitting a wall causes you to lose one heart of health and landing on the ground causes you to die immediately. Upon death the player respawns at the last checkpoint after a few seconds and can continue playing. Up to 16 players can join a single game on ''[[Xbox One Edition]]'' and ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]'', 8 players on ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''[[Wii U Edition]]'', and ''[[Nintendo Switch Edition]]'', and 4 players on ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]''. 

=== Solo ===
[[File:Ghost Glide.png|thumb|x200px|The Ghost, featured in Glide.]]
Both Time Attack and Score Attack can also be played in solo mode. When enabled, only one player is required to start the match. Online play is unavailable but multi-player play is possible using a split screen. A match is also divided into one round instead of three. A solo player can press a button to restart the entire game and you can press a different button to teleport back to the last checkpoint. The player's best run in Glide is also recorded (as long as it is under 5 minutes) and a ghost flies alongside to help the player improve.

== Tracks ==
Similar to [[Battle (mini game)|Battle]], every DLC Glide track is absent from the ''Nintendo Switch Edition'', even though all other versions, including the ''Wii U Edition'', have these tracks as purchasable DLC. This is currently still the case, where Cavern, Temple, and Canyon are the only playable tracks on the ''Nintendo Switch Edition''.

The current available Glide maps are as follows, with the ''Nintendo Switch Edition'' having access only to Cavern, Temple, and Canyon:
