The '''''Minecraft Card Game'''''{{note|Packaged as '''''Minecraft Card Game?'''''}} is a card game published by [[Mojang Studios]] and {{w|Mattel Games}}.<ref>[https://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/cards/minecraft ''Minecraft Card Game''] - Mattel Games</ref> In the game, players "mine" resource cards, so they can be used to "craft" cards, which in turn can be used to "craft" tools to collect points.

A set of the ''Minecraft Card Game'' includes<ref>[https://service.mattel.com//instruction_sheets/DJY41-Eng.pdf ''Minecraft Card Game'' instruction sheet]</ref>:

A set of one hundred cards, split into two sets: resource cards and craft cards. Twenty-five of them are craft cards. The resource cards are split as follows:
* Twenty-four wood
* Eleven "wild"
* Nine stone
* Eight iron
* Seven gold
* Six diamond
* Five Creeper
* Five TNT

There are also four card holders, in which one is to be used by each player.

== Rules ==
The objective of the game is to be the first player to earn the most points.

=== Setup ===
Shuffle all resource cards, and then deal them face down into five piles of fifteen cards each. Then, turn each pile over so that all cards in each pile are face up.

Next, shuffle the craft cards and then deal them into four piles of six cards each, with the "crafting" side up. One card is left over, which is used for the discard pile.

=== Discard pile ===
Cards are put into the discard pile if any of the following occur:
* Blown up after using a TNT card
* Sacrificed after using a Creeper card
* Traded in when crafting

=== Actions ===
A player may perform two actions during their turn, even if they are the same action. Play proceeds to the next player once the other player has completed their actions. There are three types of actions a player can perform:

==== Mine ====
If a player decides to mine a resource card, they are to take one resource card from the top of one of the five resource card piles.

==== Craft ====
If a player decides to craft, they trade in any resource cards they have available to acquire the respective craft card (e.g. if a player wishes to obtain a craft card with three diamond icons and two wood icons, they are to turn in their resource cards that are equivalent to two wood and three diamonds to "craft" it; however, if the player's resource cards don't match the required resources exactly, the player is allowed to "overpay" for the card, but is given nothing in return).

Each craft card has a point value, which is used by the player for adding points. The tool associated with the craft card can also be used by the player during the game (see [[#Using tools|this section]] for more info).

==== Reserve ====
If a player desires a craft card but is unable to pay for it, they are allowed to place their card in "Reserve", which simply involves taking the craft card they want and placing it in their card holder. Then, when the player has mined the required resources, they are allowed to use an action on their turn to trade the resources in and get the card out of "Reserve", which is then placed with the player's other craft cards.

=== Special cards ===
* '''Wild''': A "Wild" card may be used as any one type of resource (e.g. if a player has three diamonds, but not enough wood to "craft" a diamond pickaxe, the player may use a wild card to substitute for the missing wood).
* {{BlockSprite|TNT}} '''TNT:''' If a player mines a TNT card, it must be played immediately. The player must then take the top card of the other four resource piles, but are only allowed to keep two cards; only resource or "Wild" cards are allowed to be kept. Then, the TNT card and the other two cards drawn are put into the discard pile.
* [[File:CreeperFace.png|16px]] '''Creeper:''' If a player exposes a Creeper card when taking a card from the resource pile, all players must discard a resource card of their choice into the discard pile. The Creeper card is then placed into the discard pile.

=== Using tools ===
Each tool a player "crafts" has a special power. A player may use the powers at any time, and using one does not count as an action. When a tool's power is used, the player is to flip the craft card face down to show that the tool was used. Points on the card are counted even if the tool is used. The tool can only be used once. The tool powers are as follows:

* {{ItemSprite|Sword}} '''Sword:''' This tool may be used when a Creeper card is exposed to prevent the player from discarding a resource card.
* {{ItemSprite|Shovel}} '''Shovel:''' This tool may be used to force a player to limit another player to one action on their next turn.
* {{ItemSprite|Pickaxe}} '''Pickaxe:''' This tool may be used to get one additional action for the player's own turn.
* {{ItemSprite|Axe}} '''Axe:''' This tool may be used as two wood when crafting an item.
* {{ItemSprite|Hoe}} '''Hoe:''' This tool may be used to clear the top card off of every resource pile.

=== End of the game ===
