=== Sculk Spreading and Growth ===
Sculk, when connected to sculk catalysts, is used to grow a patch of sculk. See [[sculk catalyst]] for more details.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Sculk|Sculk Block}}

== Trivia ==
* "Sculk" is derived from the word "skulk," meaning "keep out of sight, typically with a sinister or cowardly motive".<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1316040636538204160|While not related, Sculk name was inspired by Jeb's process with naming the Shulkers - he liked the word "Lurker", but changed it around a bit to feel new. Sculk is one letter changed in Skulk, meaning 'keep out of sight, typically with a sinister or cowardly motive'}}</ref>
* During the prototype phase, sculk was much easier to trigger; simply stepping on it would make a lot of noise and attract the [[warden]]. This ended up being deemed unfair.<ref>{{Ytl|Z4haZTbU9ZA|The Secrets of Minecraft's Deep Dark|Minecraft|t=99}}</ref>
