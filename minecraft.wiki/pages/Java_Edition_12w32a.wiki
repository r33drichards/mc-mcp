== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Beacon JE1.png|32px]] [[Beacon]]s '''
* Named "Work in Progress" in game currently.
* By building a pyramid composed of mineral blocks such as [[emerald block]]s or [[diamond block]]s and placing this block on top, the player gains access to several powers.
** A full pyramid can provide level II powers, should the player select the level I variation in the primary powers section.
* It cannot be crafted, although a crafting recipe is planned.
** It can be obtained via the "Miscellaneous" tab in the Creative inventory, or with the <code>/give 138</code> command.
* The minimum range is 16 blocks.
* Gives off a light level of 15.
* Players within the blocks' range are given the selected effects every 4 seconds.
* The best configuration of blocks requires 164 blocks.

'''[[File:Impulse Command Block JE1.png|32px]] [[Command block]]s'''
* Intended for adventure maps.
* It can run [[commands]] when triggered by a redstone signal.
* This block is not craftable and is currently not available in the Creative inventory, but can be obtained via the command <code>/give 137</code>.

=== Items ===
'''[[Potion]]s'''
* A working [[potion of Night Vision]] is in the Creative inventory.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Zombie Villager.png|36px]] [[Zombie villager]]s'''
* [[Villager]]s have a chance of turning into zombie villagers after being killed by a [[zombie]] on Hard [[difficulty]].
* Zombie spawn eggs may spawn zombie villagers.
* Zombie villagers can naturally spawn.
* Zombie villagers can be cured, becoming normal villagers again.
** To do this, player needs to first use a splash potion of Weakness on a zombie villager. Then, they need right-click the zombie villager with a regular golden apple. After several minutes, it turns back into a normal villager.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|233649433601011712}}</ref>

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* [[Zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie pigmen]] sometimes spawn wearing equipment including enchanted weapons and any type of armor, depending on the difficulty level.

'''[[Iron golem]]s'''
* Now attack [[slime]]s and [[magma cube]]s.

'''[[Sheep]]'''
* Sheep from spawn eggs can now spawn naturally-colored sheep (white, gray, brown, pink, etc.).

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now react positively on performing new trades, and negatively if player hurts them.

* No longer remove trades, but trading something else may be required to renew the old ones.
* Several trades had their quantities altered:

** The librarian's buy book trade now requires 11 to 12 books, down from 12 to 14 books before.
** The farmer's buy arrow trade now sells 9 to 12 arrows, changed from only 5 arrows before. The 5 arrows resulted from a bug in the code where the minimum and maximum values for the arrow trade were swapped.
