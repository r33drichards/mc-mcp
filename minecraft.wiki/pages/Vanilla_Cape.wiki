The '''Vanilla cape'''{{only|je|short=1}} or '''One Vanilla Cape'''{{only|be|short=1}} is a [[cape]] given to players who owned both {{JE}} and {{BE}} for Windows before June 6, 2022 prior to both editions merging into one bundle.

The cape resembles a grass block on top and bedrock on the bottom, representing both editions of the game.

== Distribution ==
Players were able to obtain the cape under the condition that both ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition'' for Windows are owned in the same Microsoft account before June 6, 2022.

| title = Hi everyone! As some of you noticed, some piglins escaped and published some information a little early to our website. Yes, capes are coming soon to players who owned both Java and Bedrock Editions for PC before the merge into one PC product, but more details and information will be coming soon so stay tuned. Now if you'll excuse us, we have to go and return some piglins to the Nether. <a:piglin_dance:724981924820418610>

== Trivia ==
* The Vanilla Cape is the first cape to be fully available on both editions (aside from the staff-only [[Mojang Studios Cape]]).
** The [[Pan Cape]] and the [[Founder's Cape]] existed before the Vanilla Cape and were later given to ''Java Edition''. At the time, however, they were only on ''Bedrock Edition''.
* Back in 2015, ''Java Edition'' players were able to obtain a free code for the [[Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta]] on the now-defunct Mojang website. Players who obtained ''Bedrock Edition'' via this method were eligible for the cape.
