A '''dispenser''' is a low-capacity storage [[block]] that can fire [[projectile]]s, use certain items or tools or place certain blocks, fluids or entities when given a [[redstone]] signal. Items that do not have unique dispenser functions are instead ejected [[Item (entity)|into the world]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Dispensers can be mined using a [[pickaxe]], in which case it drops itself and its contents. If mined without a pickaxe, the dispenser drops only its contents.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Dispenser|Pickaxe|Wood|foot=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
'''[[Jungle temple]]s'''
*Two dispensers are naturally generated in every [[jungle temple]].

'''[[Trial chamber]]s'''
*Several dispensers can generate inside the [[trial chamber]]s with random surprises.

== Usage ==
A dispenser can be used as a container and as a [[redstone component]] that dispenses items when activated, with results varying based on the item dispensed. For example, the trap in a [[jungle pyramid]] incorporates [[arrow]]s inside a dispenser, which shoots the arrows when activated. 

To place a dispenser, {{control|use}} it while pointing at a surface adjacent to the space it should occupy. A dispenser can be placed so that its output faces in any direction, including up or down. When placed, a dispenser faces the location of the player placing it.

In {{JE}}, a dispenser cannot be moved by [[piston]]s.

=== Container ===
[[File:Dispenser GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|The GUI of the dispenser.]]

A dispenser has 9 slots of inventory space.

To open the dispenser GUI, use the {{control|Use Item}} [[control]]. To move items between the dispenser inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the dispenser GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the dispenser GUI, use the {{key|Esc}} control.

By default, the GUI of a dispenser is labeled "Dispenser". A dispenser's GUI label can be changed by naming the dispenser in an [[anvil]] before placing it, or by using the [[Commands/data|data]] command.{{only|Java}} For example, to label a dispenser at (0,64,0) "My Dispenser", use <code>data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'"My Dispenser"'}</code>.

A dispenser can be "locked" by setting the dispenser's <code>lock</code> tag. If a dispenser's <code>lock</code> tag is not blank, the dispenser cannot be accessed except by players holding an item that matches the item predicate in the <code>lock</code> tag. A dispenser's <code>lock</code> tag can be set or unset with the [[Commands#data|data]] command. For example, to lock a dispenser at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named "My Key" can access the dispenser, use <code>data merge block 0 64 0 {lock:{components:{"custom_name":"My Key"}}}</code>.

=== Redstone component ===
{{see also|Redstone circuit}}

A dispenser can be used to dispense a randomly selected [[item]] out of the ones it contains.

==== Activation ====

A dispenser is a [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|redstone mechanism]] and can be activated by:
* an adjacent active '''[[Redstone components#Power components|power component]]''': for example, a [[redstone torch]] (except that a redstone torch does not activate a dispenser it is attached to), a [[block of redstone]], a [[daylight sensor]], etc.
* an adjacent [[powered]] [[conductive]] block (for example, a block with an active redstone torch under it)
* a powered '''[[redstone repeater]]''' or '''[[redstone comparator]]''' facing the dispenser
* powered '''[[redstone dust]]''' configured to point at the dispenser, or on top of it, or a directionless "cross" next to it; a dispenser is ''not'' activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction.

Some of these methods can ''activate'' a dispenser (in the sense of triggering an action) without ''powering'' the dispenser (in the sense of whether the dispenser can power adjacent redstone dust, etc.).

In addition to the methods above, a dispenser can also be activated by [[quasi-connectivity]].{{only|java}} A dispenser becomes activated if one of the methods above ''would'' activate a mechanism component in the block above the dispenser, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dispenser is [[air]] or a [[non-conductive]] block), but only when the dispenser receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dispenser). 

A dispenser has a 4 game [[tick]] (0.2 seconds, barring lag) delay between activation and a response. During this time, additional inputs are ignored.

{{IN|be}}, the dispenser can only activate on the input/consumer redstone tick ([[C-tick]]).

==== Behavior ====

When activated, a dispenser waits for 4 game [[ticks]] (0.2 seconds, barring lag) and then ejects one item. The dispenser does not continue to eject items while activated; ejection occurs only on the initial activation (the [[Pulse circuit#Pulses|rising edge]] of an input signal). To eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dispenser with a [[clock circuit]].

If multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection. The slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dispenser is initially activated; thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dispenser between its activation and item dispensing.

The effects of being activated vary with the type of ejected item. Most items are thrown in the direction the dispenser is facing as if a player had used the {{control|Drop Item}} [[control]]. Other items behave differently when dispensed, as described in the table below. In general, a dispenser ''cannot'' place blocks into the world, aside for a few exceptions, such as shulker boxes, powder snow, and certain cases where the placed block would do something unusual. When a dispenser uses an item that has [[durability]], such as [[flint and steel]] and [[shears]], the item's durability decreases.

Unlike a [[dropper]], a dispenser can't push items inside another container.

When a dispenser dispenses an item, it emits a clicking [[sound]] (unless the item is a projectile or a [[spawn egg]]) and a smoke [[particle]]. If it is empty when activated, it emits a slightly higher-pitched click. The noise of a dispenser can be heard up to 16 blocks away.

A dispenser is a [[conductive]] block, so powering it directly can cause adjacent [[mechanism component]]s (including other dispensers) to activate as well.
