== Trivia ==
* Noxcrew refers to the [[Combat Update]] as the "End Update" on the Ender Cup website.<ref name=TGTTOS/>
* During the timeline sequence before the Dodgebolt game, several previously unnamed updates were given names, including "The Jungle Update" for [[Java Edition 1.2|1.2]] and "The Villager Trading Update" for [[Java Edition 1.3|1.3]].
* The Ender Cup intro music plays the same music as the [[MCC x Minecraft 15th Anniversary Party]] hub music called "Orienteering".
** This is now later used regularly in the next MCC events and on MCC Island minigame server.
** This was eventually released as a part of the MC Championship 2025 (Original Game Soundtrack) album on September 12, 2025.
* The Ace Race "Dark Descent" map uses the seed {{cd|-1447}} as the base for the map.<ref>{{tweet|lillybeacon|1817628934852534360|Gonna seal the deal here that it has been confirmed to be the seed by many around the MCC and Minecraft community, thanks everyone! <3 Seed: -1447  Coords: -586 195 -604}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|TheNoxite|1817619224937824686|That looks pretty right to me!! :D}}</ref>
* During the Minecraft timeline sequence before the Dodgebolt game, a Jellie [[cat]] appears at the 1.14 builds, as a tribute after Jellie's passing.
