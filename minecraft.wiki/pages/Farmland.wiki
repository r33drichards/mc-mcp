'''Farmland''' is a block created by using a [[hoe]] on most types of [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt]], and cannot be obtained in the [[inventory]] in [[Survival]] mode. It is required to grow all types of [[seeds]], as well as [[carrots]] and [[potato]]es.

'''Hydrated farmland''' ('''wet farmland''') is farmland that becomes soaked with water from a [[water]] block within 4 blocks horizontally and on the same level or 1 block above the farmland block.

== Obtaining ==
Farmland can be obtained only by executing [[commands]], via the [[Creative inventory]] or the {{control|pick block}} control in [[Creative]] mode.

=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break farmland is [[shovel]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Farmland|drop=0|Shovel|Any}}
Farmland drops 1 [[dirt]] block when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Farmland occurs naturally in [[village]]s where [[wheat]], [[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[beetroot]]s, [[pumpkin stem]]s, and [[melon stem]]s are grown. Patches of farmland are surrounded by [[log]]s or [[sandstone]], [[spruce trapdoor]], and [[cobblestone]]. Farmland also naturally occurs in certain [[woodland mansion]] rooms.

=== Post-generation ===
A player can create a block of farmland by {{Control|using}} a [[hoe]] on a [[dirt]] block, [[grass block]], or [[dirt path]]. Using a hoe on [[coarse dirt]] or [[rooted dirt]] turns them into regular dirt, which can then be tilled into farmland by using the hoe once more. [[Mycelium]] and [[podzol]] cannot be turned into farmland.<ref>{{bug|MC-8231||Mycelium and podzol cannot be tilled with hoes}}</ref>

== Usage ==
Farmland is required to grow most types of [[crops]]: [[wheat seeds]], [[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[beetroot seeds]], [[melon seeds]], [[pumpkin seeds]], [[torchflower seeds]], and [[pitcher pod]]s.

Plants such as [[sapling]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-119628|||WAI}}</ref>, [[fern]]s, [[grass]], [[flower]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-58383|||WAI}}</ref>, [[azalea]]s, [[flowering azalea]]s, [[bush]]es, [[dead bush]]es{{Only|je|short=1}}, [[firefly bush]]es, and [[sweet berries]] may be planted on farmland. [[Mushroom]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-195310}}</ref>, [[sugar cane]]<ref>{{bug|MC-168264}}</ref>, [[bamboo]]<ref>{{bug|MC-168265}}</ref>, [[twisting vines]]<ref>{{bug|MC-195308}}</ref>, and [[cacti]] cannot be planted on farmland.

Wall-mounted blocks such as [[ladder]]s and [[torch]]es cannot be attached to the side of a farmland block. Farmland is a partial block (15/16 of a block in height), so mobs cannot spawn on it.

=== Hydration ===
[[File:2554-10-18 19.28.48.png|thumb|right|Conditions in which farmland either is or isn't hydrated.]]
A farmland block is created dry and eventually reverts to [[dirt]] if not hydrated and nothing is planted on it.

For farmland to become hydrated, [[water]] must be present:
* up to four blocks away horizontally (including diagonally) from the farmland block.
* at the same level or one block above the farmland block level.

The blocks between the farmland block and the water make no difference. Whether the water is flowing or still also makes no difference.

The rate at which farmland becomes hydrated cannot be changed. Each farmland block within a 9×9 grid of farmland with a single water block in the middle has exactly the same chance of becoming hydrated as a single farmland block in an ocean.

Farmland can also be hydrated by [[rain]].

Different types of [[seeds]] grow faster on hydrated farmland than on dry farmland. Hydrated farmland yields a fully developed wheat crop in a little over a single [[day/night cycle]].

=== Decay ===
Farmland eventually decays into normal dirt if it's dehydrated and nothing is planted in it. Additionally, a farmland block becomes a dirt block, regardless of its state of hydration, if any of the following occur:

* The player or any mob jumps/falls on the block (with chance equal to distance fallen - 0.5).
** The player can trample farmland even in [[Adventure]] mode.<ref>{{bug|MC-138963}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-103500}}</ref>
** The [[mobGriefing]] gamerule must be true for mobs to trample farmland.
** {{IN|java}}, mobs smaller than 0.512 cubic blocks cannot destroy farmland. This includes [[parrot]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[chicken]]s, [[bat]]s, [[ocelot]]s, [[cat]]s, [[wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[cave spider]]s, [[endermite]]s, [[silverfish]], baby mobs, small [[slime]]s, and small [[magma cube]]s.
* A [[piston]] arm is extended over a farmland block.
* A piston pushes a farmland block down.
* A solid block covers the top surface of the farmland block such as when pumpkin or melon blocks appear, or when trees grow.
* An [[enderman]] teleports directly on top of a farmland block.

When farmland decays, any crops growing on the block are dropped as items, as if they were harvested.

A [[ravager]] does not turn farmland to dirt when stepping on it, but it does destroy all crops.

== Trivia ==
* Farmland has a 1 in 16 chance to be trampled when walking onto it from a [[slab]] next to it.
* Farmland does not revert to [[dirt]] if the player jumps onto it, if a block is two blocks above the farmland being jumped on.
* According to the developer, [[Xilefian]], "there's code that makes [[crops]] grow faster if they're in rows with a space between them" <ref name=":2">https://twitter.com/Xilefian/status/1400099375939047424</ref>
