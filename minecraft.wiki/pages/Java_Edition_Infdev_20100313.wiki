The third version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''March 13, 2010'''.<ref name="Word of Notch">[[wordofnotch:446215752|Phew, lighting works now.]] – The Word of Notch, March 13, 2010</ref>

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
'''[[World boundary]]'''
* Now exists at 32,000,000 blocks.
** The stone wall "far lands" are inaccessible without the use of modification as a result.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Daylight cycle]]'''
* Re-implemented the [[daylight cycle]], but its duration is shorter than it was in [[Indev]].
** One cycle lasts around 16 minutes. Both daytime and nighttime are 8 minutes long.

'''[[Light]]'''
* Re-added working light.
* Re-added dynamic lighting.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''{{Animate|Diamond Axe JE1 BE1.png; Diamond Pickaxe JE1 BE1.png; Diamond Shovel JE1 BE1.png; Diamond Sword JE1 BE1.png; Diamond Hoe JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Diamond]] [[axe]], [[pickaxe]], [[shovel]], [[sword]]  and [[hoe]]s'''
* Diamond tools durability has been increased from 257 to 513.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Pressing {{keys|F}} now reloads chunks too instead of just hiding them behind a fog.
** Fog is now further from the player.
** Fog is now slightly blueish.

'''[[Hotbar]]'''
{{Hotbar
|Glass, 999
|Oak Planks, 999
|Torch, 999
|Flint and Steel, 999
|Diamond Shovel, 999
|Diamond Pickaxe, 999
|
|Lava, 999
|Water, 999
}}
* The player spawns with more items when creating a new world: 999 [[glass]] blocks, 999 [[planks]], 999 [[torch]]es, 999 pairs of [[flint and steel]], 999 [[diamond shovel]]s, 999 [[diamond pickaxe]]s, 999 [[lava]] source blocks, and 999 [[water]] source blocks.

'''[[Sky]]'''
* Faster brightness re-calculation.

=== General===
'''General'''
* The game now keeps a cyclic buffer of near chunks in memory, so it no longer runs out of memory when players walk for a long distance.
** However, the game does not yet save anything to the disk, so players lose data from chunks they unload.<ref name="Word of Notch"/>

== Removals ==
=== Structures ===
[[File:Obsidian Wall.png|width=78x78]] [[Obsidian Wall|'''Obsidian wall''']]

=== General ===
* The test skybox has been removed; the sky now more closely resembles what it is in modern versions.

== Fixes ==
'''8 bugs fixed'''
* Fire, gears, torches, and crops have a texture when placed.
* Torches can be placed on the sides of blocks again.
* Furnaces have a face.
* Block breaking cracks now show up consistently.
* Fixed a significant bug at high distances that causes chunks to detach and intensely jitter with camera movement.
* The wireframe [[hitbox]] for blocks no longer jitters at high distances, and no longer distorts at high distances for certain GPUs.
* [[Block]]s no longer stop being solid after X/Z: 16,777,216.
* [[Particle]]s are no longer distorted at high distances.

== Bugs ==
'''4 bugs reported'''
* Opening the [[inventory]] crashes the game.
** However, player can still access their inventory through a workbench.
* [[Slab]]s have lighting bugs.
* Sometimes, the game crashes while generating a world, with a <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code> error being thrown.</onlyinclude>
* [[Torch]]es, [[flower]]s, [[sapling]]s, and [[Wheat Seeds|seed]]s lose precision and appear 2D at large distances.
