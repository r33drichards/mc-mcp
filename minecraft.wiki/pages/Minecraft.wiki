'''''Minecraft''''' is a {{w|3D computer graphics|3D}} {{w|sandbox game}} developed by [[Mojang Studios]], a part of [[Xbox Game Studios]]. Initially released as what is now known as ''Minecraft'' [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] on May 17, 2009, the game was [[Java Edition#Full release|fully released]] on November 18, 2011, after multiple updates. Since its release, ''Minecraft'' has expanded to mobile devices and consoles.

''Minecraft'' focuses on allowing the [[player]] to explore, interact with and modify a dynamically-generated [[world]] made of one-cubic-meter-sized [[block]]s. In addition to blocks, the environment features [[plant]]s, [[mob]]s and [[item]]s. Some activities in the game include building, mining for [[ore]], fighting hostile mobs and [[crafting]] new blocks and [[tool]]s by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create [[structure]]s, creations and artwork on various [[Combat|competitive]] or collaborative [[multiplayer]] servers or their single-player maps. Other features include [[redstone circuits]] for logic computations and remote actions, [[minecart]]s and [[Rail|tracks]], and a mysterious underworld called [[the Nether]]. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called [[the End]] and defeat the [[ender dragon]].

From its creation, ''Minecraft'' was developed almost exclusively by Swedish game developer [[Markus Persson|Markus "Notch" Persson]] until [[Jens Bergensten|Jens "Jeb" Bergensten]] took place of the head of its development. On November 6, 2014, ''Minecraft'' and all of Mojang Studios' assets were acquired by {{w|Microsoft}} for {{w|US dollar|US$}}2.5 billion.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/|title=Yes, we’re being bought by Microsoft|archive=1|archive-time=20140915131835|website=[[Mojang.com]]|date=2014-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|xboxp3|530368089418784768|It’s official, today we welcome Mojang to the Microsoft Studios family. We're excited for the possibilities ahead w/the Minecraft community.|November 6, 2014}}</ref> Notch has since left Mojang and is no longer working on the game. ''Minecraft'' features [[music]] by [[Daniel Rosenfeld|Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld]], [[Kumi Tanioka]], [[Lena Raine]], [[Samuel Åberg]], [[Aaron Cherof]], [[Amos Roddy]] and [[Hyper Potions]], as well as [[painting]]s by [[Kristoffer Zetterstrand]] and [[Sarah Boeving]].

== Gameplay ==
{{main|Gameplay}}
[[File:Survival1.13.png|right|thumb|A newly created ''Minecraft'' world.]]

=== Player ===
{{main|Player}}
The player is the person that the user controls in the [[world]]. When the user starts a game, the player is put in a world, generated from a random or specified [[world seed|seed]], with an empty [[inventory]]. If the [[bonus chest]] option is enabled, a chest filled with basic items generates near the player. The player has a [[health]] bar with 10 hearts and can be depleted when they are [[damage]]d. Damage to health can be mitigated by [[armor]] or the [[Resistance]] effect; while health can be restored by keeping the [[hunger]] bar full enough or by drinking specific [[potion]]s. If the [[difficulty]] is set to Peaceful, health regenerates on its own.

Each player can have a unique look via 9 default [[skin]]s, or by creating their own custom skin. A player can change their skin on the profile page of [[Minecraft.net]] or in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' {{in|JE}} and in the pause or main menus {{in|BE}}.

=== Blocks ===
{{main|Block}}
[[File:Ancient Greece.jpg|alt=A building based on a Greek acropolis.|thumb|280x280px|A building based on a Greek acropolis.]]
The world of ''Minecraft'' takes place within a {{w|Cubic honeycomb|three-dimensional grid of cubes}}, with each cube being occupied by a certain type of block, not all of which are necessarily cubic. There are different types of blocks; natural blocks such as [[Grass Block|grass]], [[stone]] and [[ore]]s that generate randomly within the world. There are also blocks that players can [[Crafting|craft]], such as a [[crafting table]] and a [[furnace]]. Resources can be extracted from blocks by hand or by using [[tools]]. Some of these resources are simply blocks in the player's inventory that can be placed elsewhere, while others are used as material to create other blocks or tools. Others yield no practical use whatsoever. Some blocks cannot be broken through normal Survival means, e.g. [[bedrock]], [[End portal frame]]s, [[command block]]s, [[Nether Portal (block)|Nether]] and [[End Portal (block)|End portals]], [[barrier]]s and air.

=== Mining ===
{{main|Mining}}
[[File:MultipleOreBlobs.png|right|thumb|Various [[ore]]s (in proximity of [[lava]]) that can be mined with a [[pickaxe]].]]
[[Tutorial:Mining|Mining]] is one of the main aspects of ''Minecraft'' and is done to extract ore and other materials mainly from below the surface of the map. These ores include [[coal ore|coal]], [[iron ore|iron]], [[gold ore|gold]], [[redstone ore|redstone]], [[diamond ore|diamond]], [[lapis lazuli ore|lapis lazuli]], [[copper ore|copper]] and [[emerald ore|emerald]]. Mining can involve [[digging]] a hole from the surface or going down through a [[cave]]. [[Mineshaft]]s and [[ravine]]s create extra areas that may contain resources, since they are usually rich in ores.

=== Crafting and smelting ===
{{Main|Crafting|Smelting}}
[[Crafting]] allows players to create new tools and [[block]]s using items from their [[inventory]]. Subsequent versions often contain crafting [[recipe]]s for new blocks and [[item]]s. A player can use the 2×2 grid in the inventory or the 3×3 grid provided by a crafting table to craft. Smelting requires a [[furnace]] in addition to fuel and processes blocks into a more useful form such as from [[raw iron]] into [[iron ingot]]s, which can then be crafted into iron tools and iron [[armor]].

=== Brewing and enchanting ===
{{Main|Brewing|Enchanting}}
[[File:Enchantment Table animated experience.gif|right|thumb|An [[Enchanting Table|enchanting table]] with glyphs being absorbed into it.]] 
[[Brewing]] creates [[potion]]s from various ingredients and [[water]] using a [[brewing stand]]. They are stored in a [[glass bottle]] and then consumed by the player or thrown at other mobs to generate a certain effect based on the magical ingredients used to create the potion. [[Enchanting]] is also used to upgrade [[armor]], tools or [[weapon]]s with an [[enchanting table]] or [[anvil]]. More powerful enchantments can be accessed by gaining [[experience]] and placing [[Bookshelf|bookshelves]] around the enchanting table.

=== Mobs ===
{{main|Mob}}
[[File:Creeper in forest.png|thumb|upright|right|A [[creeper]] in a [[forest]]. Creepers stalk the player and then explode once they get near.]]
[[Mob]]s are interactable creatures that inhabit the world. [[Mob#Hostile mobs|Hostile mobs]] attack the player while [[Mob#Passive mobs|passive mobs]] do not. [[Mob#Neutral mobs|Neutral mobs]] attack when provoked (not all neutral mobs are provoked the same way).

The [[Overworld]] contains many passive animal mobs that may be killed for [[food]], [[Breeding|bred]] with one another, or kept around for useful utilities. Mobs that drop food drop the raw version of their food unless killed while on [[fire]] or by an item enchanted with the [[Fire Aspect]] enchantment.

=== The Nether ===
{{main|The Nether}}
[[File:The Nether.png|thumb|right|A crimson forest in the Nether.]]
The Nether is a dimension in ''Minecraft'' accessible from the [[Overworld]] by a [[Nether portal]]. It consists of five unique [[biome]]s, which are the [[Nether wastes]], the [[basalt deltas]], the [[Crimson Forest|crimson]] and [[warped forest]]s and the [[soul sand valley]]s. Each biome has unique generation and terrain. It is populated by zombified piglins, blazes, ghasts, wither skeletons, magma cubes, piglins, and hoglins. Ores in the Nether include [[Nether quartz]], [[Nether Gold Ore|Nether gold]] and [[ancient debris]]. The Nether also has large oceans of [[lava]] that have striders walking on them.

=== The End ===
{{main|The End}}
[[File:The End.png|thumb|right|The End.]]
The End is another dimension of the game where the player battles the [[ender dragon]]. The End is accessed by entering an [[End portal]] found in a [[stronghold]]. The End is composed of [[End stone]] and is inhabited by [[endermen]]. It also contains tall [[obsidian pillar]]s on top of which are [[End crystal]]s that heal the ender dragon. Once the ender dragon is slain, the [[exit portal]] is created in the center of the map and an [[End gateway portal]] is created near an edge of the map, which transports the player to the expansive [[outer End islands]] which are full of [[chorus fruit]] forests and [[End cities]] filled of [[chest loot]] and [[shulker]]s. The End gateway portal is only accessed by throwing an [[ender pearl]], using [[elytra]] or [[trapdoor]]s to enter the portal. There are no ores in the End.

=== Multiplayer ===
{{Main|Multiplayer}}Minecraft can be played with multiple players together in one world. Players can interact with each other using the [[chat]] or [[emotes]], and can play the game together or damage each other, also known as [[PvP]] (player versus player).

==== Local connections ====
Players on the same local network ([[LAN]]) can join other worlds opened for LAN connections. The world is hosted and managed by the player running the world, who is also the [[operator]] with the ability to manage each player's [[permissions]] or kick players. {{IN|be}}, players can also join worlds opened to the Internet using the Xbox friend system. A player can add and manage friends from the in-game menus or the Xbox app, and any player can be invited to the world.[[File:Players fighting.png|thumb|right|PvP (player vs player) on a multiplayer server.]]

==== Server ====
{{Main|Server}}Multiplayer worlds can also be hosted independently from a player's ''Minecraft'' instance using an external server. Official server software for both editions can be downloaded for free on a PC, or a player could use an unofficial server-hosting service that maintains and runs the server. Players can join any external server via the Internet (except for console versions of ''Bedrock Edition''), and the server can even be online while no players are in the world. An [[Official Minecraft Server List|official server list]] has been made for some large third-party servers that provide access for any player, and players can also join specific [[featured servers]] in ''Bedrock Edition''.

''Minecraft'' multiplayer servers have developed to include their own rules and customs, guided by their administrators and moderators. The term [[Tutorial:Griefing prevention|griefer]], meaning a player who causes grief, is a typical term on the internet but has taken up its definition on ''Minecraft'' servers: a person who destroys or defiles other users' creations on servers. <!-- Does this need to be included, its not official minecraft? -->

One popular game on multiplayer servers is [[Spleef]] (a play on the word "grief"), a game where the player aims to make another player drop through the floor by destroying blocks beneath the opponent's feet. This is typically played in a designated area and is usually run automatically using server plugins.

Many popular multiplayer servers exist that may contain, PvP arenas, custom [[minigames]] or large [[Survival]] or [[Creative]] worlds.

==== ''Minecraft'' Realms ====
{{main|Realms}}
'''''Minecraft'' Realms''' is an official subscription-based [[server]] hosting service that allows players to create and manage their own private ''Minecraft'' multiplayer worlds. Hosted by [[Mojang Studios]], Realms provides an easy and fast way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without prior knowledge of the concepts for hosting on the internet. However, Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.<ref>{{tweet|danfrisk|311725356434460672|Quick info: Minecraft Realms isn't built for huge public servers. The sweetspot is a group of invited friends or as a family server.|March 13, 2013}}</ref> Private Realms servers are easy to set up and available 24/7 as long as the owner pays for it.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{main|Bedrock Edition}}
[[File:Pocket.jpg|thumb|right|Notch with ''Minecraft: Pocket Edition'' on the ''Xperia Play''.]]
The '''''Bedrock Edition''''' (also known as the '''Bedrock Platform'''/'''Codebase'''/'''Engine''', and officially Minecraft or Minecraft for Windows) is a multi-platform version of ''Minecraft'' developed by [[Mojang Studios]] and {{w|Xbox Game Studios}}. Unlike ''Java Edition'', which runs on [[w:Java]], ''Bedrock Edition'' runs on C++. Since the engine originated with ''Minecraft: Pocket Edition'', this entire product family has often been referred to as "''Pocket Edition''", "MCPE" and "Pocket/Windows 10 Edition".

Before the [[Better Together Update]], ''Bedrock Edition'' only existed as {{el|pe}} (for iOS and Android) and {{el|Windows 10}}.

Predating the Better Together Update, ''Minecraft: Pocket Edition'' was initially launched exclusively for the {{w|Sony Ericsson Xperia Play|Xperia PLAY}} on Google Play<ref>{{Citation|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe|title=Minecraft: Dream it, Build it!|website=Google Play Store|date=2025-11-27}}</ref> for US$6.99 on August 15, 2011. It was later released for other {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}} devices on October 7, 2011,<ref>{{tweet|kappische|122246496941899776}}</ref> and {{w|iOS}} on November 17, 2011.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://appleinformer.org/2011/11/minecraft-pocket-edition-for-ios-now-available-for-download/|title=Minecraft Pocket Edition for iOS Now Available for Download|archive=1|archive-time=20120316033004|website=Apple Informer|date=2011-11-17}}</ref> On September 13, 2012, the ''Pocket Edition'' was made available for purchase on the Amazon Appstore. The {{w|Windows Phone}} version was released on the Windows Phone Store on December 10, 2014,<ref>{{Citation|url=https://windowscentral.com/minecraft-pocket-edition-comes-windows-phone|title=Minecraft Pocket Edition comes to Windows Phone|archive=1|archive-time=20150104212315|website=Windows Central|date=2014-12-10}}</ref> for which the [[Pocket Edition 1.0.0]] release and newer are available only for Windows 10 Phone and newer. Since then, four adaptations of ''Pocket Edition'' have been released; for [[Windows 10 Edition|Windows 10]] on July 29, 2015, the [[Gear VR Edition|Gear VR]] on April 27, 2016, [[Apple TV Edition|tvOS]] on December 19, 2016, and the [[Fire TV Edition|Fire TV]] on December 19, 2016.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://mojang.com/2015/07/announcing-minecraft-windows-10-edition-beta|title=Announcing: Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition Beta|archive=1|archive-time=20150704220210|website=[[Mojang.com]]|date=2015-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.meta.com/blog/minecraft-now-available-on-oculus-for-gear-vr/|title=Minecraft Now Available on Oculus for Gear VR|website=Meta|date=2016-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{mcnet|apple-tv-edition-released|Apple TV Edition released!|December 19, 2016|Owen Jones}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.amazon.com/Mojang-Minecraft-for-Fire-TV/dp/B01NCJDPER|title=Minecraft for Fire TV|archive=1|archive-time=20190710013607|website=Amazon.com}}</ref> As of September 24, 2018, the {{el|Apple TV}} has been discontinued.

After the Better Together Update, all versions of ''Minecraft: Pocket Edition'' were merged together, along with the [[Legacy Console Edition]]s of the latest consoles:
* [[Xbox One Edition]]
* [[Nintendo Switch Edition]]
* [[Play Station 4 Edition]]

=== Legacy Console Edition ===
{{main|Legacy Console Edition}}
Legacy Console Edition refers to the editions of ''Minecraft'' for consoles that are developed and updated by [[4J Studios]].

The Legacy Console Edition was initially announced for the {{w|Xbox 360}} on June 7, 2011, during {{w|E3 2011}}. {{el|360}} released digitally on May 9, 2012 followed by a physical release on June 4, 2013. The game was later released on additional platforms as {{el|ps3}} on December 17, 2013, {{el|ps4}} on September 4, 2014, {{el|xb1}} on September 5, 2014, {{el|psv}} on October 14, 2014, {{el|wii}} on December 17, 2015, and {{el|ns}} on May 11, 2017. As of December 10, 2019, no further feature updates have been released for these versions, and the newest available update depends on the platform. The most recent update on {{el|xb1}} and {{el|ns}} is the [[World of Color Update]], while {{el|360}}, {{el|ps3}}, {{el|psv}}, and {{el|wii}} have access to [[Update Aquatic]]. {{el|ps4}} is the most up-to-date version with [[Village & Pillage]].

=== ''Minecraft Education'' ===
{{main|Minecraft Education}}
''Minecraft Education'' (''Edition'', before late 2022) is an educational version of ''Minecraft'' specifically designed for classroom use. It is developed by Mojang Studios and Xbox Game Studios and contains features that make ''Minecraft'' easy to use in a classroom setting. The full game was released on November 1, 2016.

== Game customization ==
=== Add-ons ===
{{main|Add-on}}
'''Add-ons'''{{only|be}} are the first step towards bringing customization to all editions of ''Minecraft'' and are officially supported by [[Mojang Studios]]/''Minecraft''. They currently allow players to transform the look of their worlds, change the behavior of mobs, and add entities, items and blocks, structures, functions and biomes.

=== Behavior packs ===
{{main|Behavior pack}}
'''Behavior packs'''{{only|be}} dictate how vanilla and custom entities behave, and they can also introduce functions and scripts. When paired with a resource pack designed to complement it, they form an add-on, which allows for the addition of new content to the game.

=== Resource packs ===
{{Main|Resource pack}}
The game officially supports changing most of its various textures, sounds, and texts through '''resource packs'''. Resource packs must contain a certain structure of files and folders placed in the <samp>[[.minecraft]]/resourcepacks</samp> folder. Installed resource packs, as well as the folder in which resource packs are placed, can be accessed in the options menu. The extent to which the resources are changed is dependent on how many files are contained in the resource pack.

=== Data packs ===
{{Main|Data pack}}
Data packs{{only|je}} provide a way for players to further customize vanilla worlds in a similar way to resource packs. Unlike resource packs, which modify the game's resources, data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, functions, loot tables, structures, recipes and tags without any code modification.

=== Skins ===
{{main|Skin}}
Skin refers to the texture that is placed onto a player model or mob.
The skin is divided into areas that act as the surface area of the character (for example, the front head area, left leg area, etc.). A skin allows only solid color; transparency is not allowed on the skin file except on the second layer, which is transparent by default; playing offline, pixels can be left free resulting in "holes" in the skin. The second layer can be used to give the character glasses, hats, or other accessories. Players can also change the arm size to be slim or normal. The slim variant is 3 pixels wide while the normal variant is 4 pixels wide.

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
{{in|je}}, there are no special features in the skins. This version has only the features listed in the first part of this section.

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
{{IN|be}}, there are many more types of skin customization. [[Player]]s can add 3D custom hair, eyes, mouths, arms, legs and more. Players can also change the size of a character. Players can also get many different accessories for the skin. However, the player cannot do this with a custom skin, only with an in-game skin. Players can also buy accessories and skins. Having a skin that is smaller than normal or larger does not affect the hitbox size, but can still give an advantage in multiplayer servers because it can be harder to see them. Some of the skins also do not show their armor or hand-held [[item]]s.

=== Capes ===
{{main|Cape}}
Capes are an uncommon vanity item that can be equipped on a player's back. {{IN|be}}, players start with a cape that is not equipped by default and some skins come with capes.

Capes also flail around when the player runs. When the player equips elytra, the texture of the elytra changes to an equipped cape.

=== Unofficial mods ===
{{disclaimer|section=1}}
{{main|Mods}}
''Minecraft'' can be modified by replacing or adding Java class files to <samp>[[client.jar]]</samp> {{in|je}}. This method of making custom modifications is not supported by Mojang as it can break the game if the mod is outdated, defective, or in conflict with another mod. Some such modifications impressed Notch or Jeb sufficiently that they were added to the game and the authors were credited under Additional Programming. Some examples of mods being implemented into the main game include the [[Region file format|McRegion]] mod, Hippoplatimus' [[Piston]] Mod and horses from Dr. Zhark's Mo' Creatures mod, being added in [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]], [[Java Edition Beta 1.7|Beta 1.7]] and [[Java Edition 1.6.1|release 1.6.1]] respectively.

=== Third-party programs ===
{{disclaimer|section=1}}
{{main|Programs and editors}}
There are many programs designed for ''Minecraft''. These include 3D map editors and viewers, game modifiers, various informational programs (such as crafting recipes) and server wrappers, and other specialty programs. As with mods, these too are not supported by Mojang.

== Reception ==
{{w|Metacritic}} ranked ''Minecraft'' as one of the best video games of the 2010s,<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.metacritic.com/feature/best-videogames-of-the-decade-2010s|title=The Best Video Games of the Decade (2010-19), According to Game Critics|archive=1|archive-time=20191206144841|website=Metacritic|date=2019-12-06}}</ref> and Video Game Canon ranks ''Minecraft'' as one of the best games of all time.<ref>https://videogamecanon.com</ref>{{Better source}}
