<onlyinclude>
'''26.1''' is an upcoming [[game drop]] for {{JE}} with no set release date, which adds new textures and models for baby animals, makes [[name tag]]s craftable, and fixes bugs.

This is the first ''Java Edition'' release version to use the [[Version formats#Release|new "''year''.''drop''.''hotfix''" version format]] announced in December 2025.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-new-version-numbering-system|Minecraft’s new version numbering system|December 2, 2025}}</ref> It is also the first ''Java Edition'' release version to be fully unobfuscated without any accompanying obfuscated variant,<ref>{{Mcnet|removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition|Removing obfuscation in Java Edition|October 29, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-26-1-snapshot-1|Minecraft 26.1 Snapshot 1|December 16, 2025}}</ref> and the first to require Java 25.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|swing}}'''
* New command that enables swinging of entities' arms.
* Not all entities support swing animation. {{cmd|swing}} will succeed for those entities, but clients will only display it when possible.
** For example, this makes it possible to swing mannequin arms.
* Returns the amount of entities for which a swing was sent.
** Syntax: {{cmd|swing <entity selector> <mainhand&vert;offhand>}}
* Both arguments can be omitted and will fall back to the following defaults:
** The entity selector will be {{cd|@s}} if omitted
** Which hand to swing will be {{cd|mainhand}} if omitted

'''[[Skeleton horse]]s and [[zombie horse]]s'''
* No longer panic when hurt.

=== Command Format ===
'''{{cmd|time}}'''
* The {{cmd|time}} command is now based on world clocks.
** A clock can be optionally specified as an input for the time command with {{cmd|time of <clock> ...}}.
** If the clock is not specified ({{cmd|time ...}} as before), the default clock for the dimension is used.
* The return value (e.g. from {{cmd|execute store}}) from the {{cd|set}} and {{cd|add}} subcommands is now the total elapsed ticks of the clock instead of the current time of day.
* Syntax:
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] set <time>}} - sets the total elapsed ticks of the clock.
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] set <timemarker>}} - advances the clock forward to the next occurrence of the time marker..
*** For the {{cd|minecraft:overworld}} clock, the available time markers are: {{cd|day}}, {{cd|noon}}, {{cd|night}}, and {{cd|midnight}}
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] add <time>}} - adds ticks to the clock, can be a negative or a positive number.
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] pause}} - pauses the clock.
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] resume}} - resumes the clock.
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] query <timeline>}} - displays and returns the current number of ticks within the timeline's period.
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] query <timeline> repetitions}} - displays and returns the number of times the timeline's period has repeated.
** {{cmd|time [of <clock>] query time}} - displays and returns the total elapsed ticks of the clock.
** {{cmd|time query gametime}} - as before, the total elapsed ticks within the world (unaffected by changes made to clocks using {{cmd|time}}).

=== General ===
'''General'''
* If a server's disk space is low, a toast will now be shown to server operators.
* The game now requires Java 25.
* The included Java distribution is now the Microsoft build of OpenJDK 25.
* Piglin inventory slots can now be accessed using {{cd|piglin.*}} similar to how villager inventories can be accessed using {{cd|villager.*}}.
* Tweaked default JVM options.
** The game now allocates 4 GB of RAM by default (up from 2 GB).
** Garbage collection has been changed from G1GC to ZGC for compatible computers.{{More information needed|Which hardware/software configuration is needed for ZGC to be enabled by default?}}

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|97.0}}.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* The {{cd|looking_at_block}} and {{cd|looking_at_fluid}} debug entries no longer show tags.
* A {{cd|day_count}} debug entry has been split from {{cd|local_difficulty}}.
* New debug entries have been added:
** {{cd|looking_at_block_tags}}
** {{cd|looking_at_fluid_tags}}
** {{cd|looking_at_entity_tags}}
* Renamed debug entries:
** {{cd|looking_at_block}} -> {{cd|looking_at_block_state}}
** {{cd|looking_at_fluid}} -> {{cd|looking_at_fluid_state}}

'''[[Dimension type]]s'''
* Added the field {{cd|default_clock}}: optional world clock ID.
** Specifies the default clock that will be used for the {{cmd|time}} command.
*** If not specified, the time command will require an explicit clock argument.
** Also specifies the clock to which {{cd|minecraft:wake_up_from_sleep}} and {{cd|minecraft:roll_village_siege}} time markers apply.
*** If not specified, those time markers will never apply in that dimension.

'''[[Enchantment definition]]'''
* The {{cd|post_piercing_attack}} component no longer only works for a player if that player has a certain food level.

'''[[Entity data]]'''
* The {{cd|current_explosion_impact_pos}} and {{cd|current_impulse_context_reset_grace_time}} fields from players have been added to all mobs and the [[armor stand]].
* The {{cd|ignore_fall_damage_from_current_explosion}} field on players has been removed.

'''[[Game rule]]s'''
* The game rules screen is now accessible in-game through a new World Options screen in the pause menu.
* A search bar has been added to the top of the game rules screen, both in-game and in the world creation menu.

'''[[Game Test]]s'''
* Replaced {{cd|time_of_day}} with {{cd|clock_time}}.
** Added a new required field {{cd|clock}}: world clock ID, the clock within which to set time (from the existing time field).

'''Lightmap algorithm'''
* The algorithm that maps block and sky light levels to how bright things appear on screen has been fully rewritten.
* A new algorithm that is supposed to mostly provide the same overall results as previous one, but:
** It is simpler and more straightforward, and fixes multiple issues of the previous one.
** The [[darkness]] effect and world darkening effect of the [[Wither]] fight now works the same way in all dimensions.
** The [[night vision]] effect now simply adds ambient light instead of scaling the resulting colors.
*** It means that fully dark areas no longer look brighter than areas lit by block or sky light.
** Other aspects of the algorithm such as block light tint, ambient light color and night vision color are now data-driven through environment attributes.

'''Lightmap shader'''
* The {{cd|lightmap.fsh}} shader was significantly modified.
** The {{cd|LightmapInfo}} uniform now has two new fields:
*** {{cd|BlockLightTint}}
*** {{cd|NightVisionColor}}
** The {{cd|AmbientLightFactor}} field was removed, its value is now premultiplied into {{cd|AmbientColor}}
** The {{cd|DarkenWorldFactor}} was renamed to {{cd|BossOverlayWorldDarkeningFactor}}
* Text and items rendered in UI now use a separate 1x1 white lightmap texture, so the lightmap shader does not always have to keep the 15, 15 pixel purely white.

'''[[Loot functions]]'''
* Changed {{cd|minecraft:enchant_with_levels}}
** Now also takes the following field:
*** {{cd|include_additional_cost_component}} - optional boolean representing if a {{cd|minecraft:additional_trade_cost}} component should be added to the item based on the cost of the enchantment.
**** Defaults to {{cd|false}}
**** The value is determined by the levels number provider and is the same that is used to determine what enchantment level is used for enchanting.

* Changed {{cd|minecraft:enchant_randomly}}
** Now also takes the following field:
*** {{cd|include_additional_cost_component}} - optional boolean representing if a {{cd|minecraft:additional_trade_cost}} component should be added to the item based on the cost of the enchantment.
**** Defaults to {{cd|false}}
**** The value is determined by the value selected by levels or its default value using the following formula: <math>2 + random(0, 5 + level * 10) + 3 * level</math>

'''[[Mob variant definitions]]'''
* Wolf sound variants sound events in {{cd|wolf_sound_variant}} have been moved into a new field {{cd|adult_sounds}} and the field {{cd|baby_sounds}} was added.

'''[[Options]]'''
* The difficulty button in the pause menu has been replaced with a button leading to a new screen - World Options.
** The world options screen contains the difficulty button as well as a button for changing game rules.
** The game rules screen is available for all operators and otherwise disabled.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Entity Predicates
** {{cd|player}} Sub-Predicate
*** New optional field: {{cd|food}} 
*** A Food predicate
*** Format: Object with fields:
**** {{cd|level}} - optional integer min/max range specifying the required food level.
**** {{cd|saturation}} - optional float min/max range specifying the required saturation level.

* {{cd|minecraft:time_check}} loot predicate
** Added {{cd|clock}} field: a world clock ID, specifies which world clock the time check should be done for.

'''[[Recipe]]s'''
* {{cd|result}} field should now be more consistent across all recipe types that contain it.
** It will now accept short form (e.g. "{{cd|minecraft:foo}}", which is equivalent to <code>{"id":"minecraft:foo", "count": 1}</code>).
** For recipe types {{cd|smelting}}, {{cd|blasting}}, {{cd|smoking}} and {{cd|campfire_cooking}} this field now also accepts {{cd|count}} field.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|78.0}}.

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Added new sound events for the baby [[cat]]:
** <samp>entity.baby_cat.ambient</samp>
** <samp>entity.baby_cat.hiss</samp>
** <samp>entity.baby_cat.hurt</samp>

*** {{cd|#dry_vegetation_may_place_on}} → {{cd|#supports_dry_vegetation}}
*** {{cd|#bamboo_plantable_on}} → {{cd|#supports_bamboo}}

'''[[Timeline]]s'''
* Added a {{cd|clock}} field: a world clock ID, specifies which world clock the timeline is tied to.
** This field is required, but to match previous behavior the {{cd|minecraft:overworld}} clock can be used
* Added an optional {{cd|time_markers}} field, an optional map between namespaced Time Marker IDs and either an int or a Time Marker object.
** Format:
*** Non-negative int, the tick that the time marker marks.
*** Or object with fields:
**** {{cd|ticks}}: int between {{cd|0}} and {{cd|period_ticks}}, the tick that the time marker marks.
**** {{cd|show_in_commands}}: optional boolean, specifies whether the Time Marker will show up in command suggestions.
***** Default: {{cd|false}}
