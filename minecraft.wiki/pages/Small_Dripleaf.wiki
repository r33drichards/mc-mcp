A ''' small dripleaf''' is a [[plant]] which generates in [[lush caves]], and is used to grow [[big dripleaves]], a platforming block.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A small dripleaf can be obtained by mining it using [[shears]]. A small dripleaf drops nothing when mined using any other tool, pushed with a [[piston]] or [[sticky piston]], or broken by destroying or moving the block under it. It [[instant mining|breaks instantly]] in all cases.

=== Natural generation ===
Small dripleaves naturally generate within the [[lush caves]] [[biome]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 2 small dripleaves for 1 [[emerald]]. Note that small dripleaves cannot be farmed as such:  Bone meal converts them to a big dripleaf, which ''can'' be grown/duplicated with [[bone meal]], but that does not produce ''small'' dripleaves.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Small dripleaf can be placed on top of [[clay]] and [[moss block]]s. It can also be placed on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[farmland]], [[grass block]]s, [[podzol]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mycelium]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[mud]], and [[pale moss block]]s if these blocks are [[water|underwater]].

=== Bone meal ===
{{control|Using}} [[bone meal]] on a small dripleaf causes it to grow into a [[big dripleaf]], from two to five blocks tall. The small dripleaf is consumed in the process, and cannot be retrieved.

Small dripleaves do not grow on their own.

=== Composting ===
Small dripleaves can be placed into a [[composter]], with a 30% chance to increase its compost level.

|{{HistoryLine||1.17|dev=21w19a|<code>minecraft:small_dripleaf</code> has been added to the newly-implemented <code>#minecraft:mineable/axe</code> [[block tag]].
