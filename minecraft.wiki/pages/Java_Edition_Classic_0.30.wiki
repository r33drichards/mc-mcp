'''0.30''' refers to 2 versions of [[Java Edition Classic]] released on November 10, 2009, at 18:21 UTC<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: (18:21:01) <Notch> phew, ok, I think creative is updated</ref> and survival at 18:49 UTC.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(18:49:57) <Notch> phew"..."(18:50:00) <Notch> clients should be updated new"</ref> They were announced on [[The Word of Notch|TWoN]] at 19:05 UTC.<ref>[[wordofnotch:239361671|Minor client updates]] – The Word of Notch, November 10, 2009</ref><ref>{{ytl|oNPaS_PYRxE|Minecraft - Flooding the RIVAR||lken3 - November 26, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|NLeEJiTIiqc|Playin some minecraft||kaboomarang - December 18, 2009}}</ref> The only difference between these two versions is that one version is in [[Creative]] mode, while the other is in [[Survival]] mode.<ref group=note>This is done by a simple boolean switch in the main class of the code.</ref> The creative version was the one featured for free on the Minecraft website before being re-designed on December 16, 2010. Server versions [[Classic server 1.10|1.10]] and [[Classic server 1.10.1|1.10.1]] were released with these versions, it is the last version to have creative multiplayer. 0.30 is the last version of [[Late Classic Creative|Late Classic]], and the final version of Classic development to be released.

The survival version was reuploaded at 18:58 UTC and the creative at 19:00 UTC.{{more info}}

A 2011 recompiled version of the Creative variant is available in the [[launcher]], mislabeled as '''0.30_01c''', and is a renewed version of 0.30 Creative. Both have identical gameplay. A hash for "0.30_01a" was included in a list of version hashes compiled by Searge,{{cn}} but it was actually for a texture pack for 0.30,  included in Mojang's archives by mistake.<!--notes needed-->

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Grass Block JE2.png|32px]] [[Grass Block]]'''
* Attempting to place grass blocks by means of hacking one's [[inventory]] in  multiplayer now causes the server to automatically kick the player.
* Grass blocks in the player's inventory, at this point, have the green top-texture on all sides of the block [[File:Grass Block JE1.png|32px]].

'''[[File:TNT JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[TNT]]'''
* Hitting a [[primed TNT]] defuses it and lets it be picked up.
* Explosions no longer produce smoke particles.

=== General ===
'''Loading and saving'''
* Drastically improved world generation time.
** Previously, generating a new world could take up to 2 minutes. From 0.30 onward, generating a new world only takes a few seconds.
* Added local file saving.
* Online saving is no longer available for free accounts.
** A message is displayed if a player tries to save a world online with a free account.

== Fixes ==
'''5 bugs fixed'''
* [[Block]]s now drop themselves again.
* Fixed the [[sheep]] hitbox so it no longer has areas the player can hit through.
* In survival mode, other mobs can now spawn naturally.
* TNT no longer disappears upon being hit.
* [[Multiplayer]] lag decreased.
