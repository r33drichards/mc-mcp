A '''block of diamond''', known internally as a '''diamond block''', is a precious mineral [[block]] equivalent to nine [[diamond]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Blocks of diamond can be mined with an [[iron pickaxe]] or better.

== Usage ==
Blocks of diamond can be used to store [[diamond]]s in a compact fashion. 

=== Beacons ===
Blocks of diamond can be used to "power" a [[beacon]]. The beacon can be powered by a 3×3 square of diamond blocks underneath it, and can optionally also include a 5×5, 7×7 and 9×9 layer in the shape of a pyramid under the original layer to increase the effects from the beacon. The layers do not have to be entirely diamond blocks, as they may also contain [[blocks of iron]], [[blocks of gold]], [[blocks of netherite]], and [[blocks of emerald]].
