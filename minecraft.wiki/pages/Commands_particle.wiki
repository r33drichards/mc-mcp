Creates [[particles]].

== Syntax ==
*'''Java Edition'''
: <code>particle <name> [<pos>]</code>
: <code>particle <name> <pos> <delta> <speed> <count> [force|normal] [<viewers>]</code>
*'''Bedrock Edition'''
: <code>particle <effect: string> [position: x y z]</code>

== Arguments ==
{{argument|name|particle|effect: string|basic_string}}
: Specifies the [[particle|particle type]] to create.
: {{arg desc|je=particle|be=string}}

{{argument|pos|vec3|position: x y z|CommandPositionFloat}}
: Specifies the position at which to create particle. If not specified, defaults to the position of the commmand execution.
: {{arg desc|je=vec3|be=CommandPositionFloat}}

{{el|je|short=1}}: {{argument|count|integer}}
: Specifies the number of particle effects to create. If 0, see below for what it results in.
: {{arg desc|je=integer|min=0}}

{{el|je|short=1}}: {{argument|delta|vec3}} — {{arg desc|je=vec3}}<br>
{{el|je|short=1}}: {{argument|speed|float}} — {{arg desc|je=float|min=0.0}}
: {{cd|<delta>}} and {{cd|<speed>}} parameters determine where the particles are created and the parameters to pass into the particles (see the table [[#Extra parameters of particle types|Extra parameters of particle types]] below). Based on whether {{cd|<count>}} is 0 or not, the two parameters have different meanings.
:* if {{cd|<count>}} is 0, creates a single particle at the {{cd|<pos>}}. Multiplies each of the three values in{{cd|<delta>}} by {{cd|<speed>}} value, then passes them into the particles as three parameters.
:** This means that for most particles that receive parameters, if {{cd|<count>}} is 0, the <code><delta></code> acts as motion values for the particle, with <code><speed></code> acting as a multiplier, so the particle move in the direction of <code><delta></code>.
:* If {{cd|<count>}} is not 0, the specified count of particles are created at random positions. The positions obey normal distributions in each of the X, Y, and Z directions. Each normal distribution has a mean value of each value in {{cd|<pos>}}, meaning that particles are more likely to be created closer to the {{cd|<pos>}}. Each normal distribution has a standard deviation of each value in {{cd|<delta>}} (e.g. <code>1 1 1</code> means that the coordinates on X, Y, and Z axes obey three standard normal distributions, meaning that there is a 99.7% probability that the particle is created in a 6×6×6 cuboid region centered at the {{cd|<pos>}}; <code>2 2 2</code> means that the particle has a 99.7% probability of being created in a 12×12×12 cuboid region centered at the {{cd|<pos>}}). Negative values are accepted in {{cd|<delta>}}, but have the same effect as their positive counterparts (e.g. <code>-1 -1 -1</code> has the same effect as <code>1 1 1</code>). Each of the extra parameters to be passed into the particles also follows a normal distribution, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of each value in {{cd|<speed>}}.
: {{cd|<delta>}} accepts [[Coordinates#Commands|relative coordinates and local coordinates]], which are converted to absolute coordinates, so relative coordinates and local coordinates are generally useless here.
: If not specified, {{cd|<delta>}} defaults to <code>0 0 0</code>; {{cd|<speed>}} defaults to <code>0</code>.

{{el|je|short=1}}: {{cd|force{{!}}normal}}
: Specifies the display mode: <code>normal</code> or <code>force</code>.
:: <code>normal</code>: The particle(s) are sent to players within 32.0 blocks (exclusive), may not be shown if the "Particles" option in Video Settings is "Minimal" (depending on the particle type, some particle types still displays when it is "Minimal")
:: <code>force</code>: Allows the particle(s) to be sent to players within 512.0 blocks (exclusive). Always shown even if the "Particles" option in Video Settings is "Minimal".
:: Defaults to the <code>normal</code> mode.

{{el|je|short=1}}: {{argument|viewers|entity}}
: Allows control of which player should view this particle instead of everyone in the viewing range of the particle.
: {{arg desc|je=entity|amount=multiple|type=players}}

== Examples ==
To create a stationary huge explosion particle 10 blocks to the east:
* {{JE}}: <code>/particle minecraft:explosion_emitter ~10 ~ ~</code>
* {{BE}}: <code>/particle minecraft:huge_explosion_emitter ~10 ~ ~</code>

Using the [[particle format]] arguments in {{El|java}} to create purple dust with large particles:
* <code>/particle minecraft:dust{color:[1, 0, 1], scale:4} ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 1 10</code>

Using the <code><delta></code> and <code><speed></code> arguments to pass parameters to the command and make a single particle move downward (note that <code>count</code> must be zero):
* <code>/particle minecraft:white_smoke ^ ^1 ^2 0 -1 0 0.1 0</code>

The same command with <code><count></code> nonzero instead uses <code><delta></code> to determine particle distribution, producing a vertical cloud of particles:
* <code>/particle minecraft:white_smoke ^ ^1 ^2 0 -1 0 0.1 10</code>
