=== Crocs Crossing ===
There are 4 playable characters in the game: [[Ari]], [[Efe]], [[Sunny]], and [[Zuri]] (renders of characters can be viewed in {{slink||Renders}} section). The characters are wearing Crocs, which are also available in the [[Bedrock Edition]] [[marketplace]]. The player runs across a long stone road spread across three blocks and surrounded by lava. They can jump by pressing the up arrow, or move horizontally between the three blocks by pressing the left and right arrows. There are holes in the road and [[creeper]]s waiting to explode. Falling into the lava holes or getting exploded by a creeper by running into it ends the game. Minecraft themed Jibbitz spawn on the road, awarding points when collected.

Different Jibbitz award different amounts of points:

* Grass block: 5 points
* Zombie: 10 points
* Creeper: 15 points
* Diamond ore: 20 points
* Obsidian: 25 points
* Enderman: 50 points

After the game ends, an image with the results, including the score and a breakdown of the collected Jibbitz, can be downloaded.
