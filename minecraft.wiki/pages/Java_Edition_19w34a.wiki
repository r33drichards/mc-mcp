'''19w34a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.15]],<ref>{{tweet|adrian_ivl|1164523905593294850|It's time for the first 1.15 snapshot to be released into the wild!|August 22, 2019}}</ref> released on August 22, 2019,<ref name="19w34a">{{snap|19w34a|August 22, 2019}}</ref> which adds [[bee]]s and bee-related items, such as [[bee hive]]s, [[honey bottle]]s and [[honeycomb]]s.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Bee Nest (S) JE1.png|32px]] [[Bee nest]]s'''
* Spawn naturally in [[flower forest]]s, [[plains]], and [[sunflower plains]] biomes.
* Can house [[bee]]s.
* Fills up with honey.
** The amount of honey in the bee nest increases as bees gather nectar and return to their nest.
** The player can harvest [[honeycomb]]s and [[honey bottle]]s from the nest {{ctrl|using}} [[shears]] and [[glass bottle]]s respectively.
** If the player breaks or harvests honey from the nest, the bees become hostile on the player.
*** Bees inside the nest don't turn hostile if it is broken with [[Silk Touch]], but bees outside the nest do.
*** Bees don't turn hostile if there is a [[campfire]] underneath the nest when honeycombs or honey bottles are harvested. 
* Is a [[block entity]] and cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s.

'''[[File:Beehive (S) JE1.png|32px]] [[Bee hive]]s'''
* Can be crafted using 6 [[planks]] and 3 [[honeycomb]]s.
* Function the same as [[bee nest]]s, but don't need [[Silk Touch]] to be dropped.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Honey Bottle JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Honey bottle]]s'''
* Restores {{Hunger|6}} and 9.6 saturation.
* Can be used to craft 3 [[sugar]].
* Obtained by {{ctrl|using}} a [[glass bottle]] on bee hives/nests with a <code>honey_level</code> of 5.

'''[[File:Honeycomb JE1 BE2.png|32px]] [[Honeycomb]]s'''
* Obtained by {{ctrl|using}} [[shears]] on bee hives/nests with a <code>honey_level</code> of 5.
* Can be used to craft [[bee hive]]s.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Bee Spawn Egg JE1.png|32px]] [[Bee spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Bee.png|32px]] [[Bee]]s'''
* Have {{hp|10}} health.
* Live in groups near hives and nests.
** If a bee does not have a home nest, it wanders until it finds one.
** Can hide inside hives.
*** Maximum of 3 bees per nest.
* When attacked, all bees from the same hive try to attack the original attacker.
** The same happens when their hive/nest is destroyed.
*** Placing a [[campfire]] under the nest makes the bees passive.
** Have an {{nbt|int|Anger}} data tag, which defaults to zero.
*** When the bee is attacked, this tag is set to around 700 ticks.
** When they attack, they give [[Poison]] to the target for 10 seconds and then they die 50–60 seconds after attacking.
** When bees attack the player, their eyes turn red.
* Can be bred using any type of [[flower]], including wither roses.
** They follow any player holding a small flower.
*** If the player holds still, the bees land around them.
* Hover around flowers and enter a "pollinated" state after some time. When pollinated, pale white particles come off them. The bee also has its texture changed to include dots similar in color to the pollen particles.
** Bees try to pollinate [[wither rose]]s despite the fact that they are harmed by the [[Wither effect]] they give.
** When they pollinate flowers, a small popping noise is heard.
** Return to their nest after entering the "pollinated" state. 
** A pollinated bee can accelerate the growth of [[crops]] and sweet berry bushes it passes.
** After enough bees enter a bee nest in the pollinated state, the bee nest becomes filled with honey.
* Being killed by a bee sting results in new [[death message]]: "<''player''> was stung to death".

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* New particles: {{cd|dripping_honey|falling_honey|falling_nectar|landing_honey|d=,}}.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* New function:
** <code>copy_state</code> – Copies state properties from {{ctrl|dropped}} block to {{nbt|compound|BlockStateTag}} in dropped [[item]].
*** Parameters:
**** {{nbt|string|block}} – source of properties (block ID).
**** {{nbt|compound|properties}} – list of property names. All must be present on [[block]].

=== General ===
'''[[Language]]s'''
* Added [[wikipedia:Yiddish|Yiddish]] language.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:bee_growables|minecraft:beehives|minecraft:crops|minecraft:flowers|minecraft:tall_flowers|d=and}} block tags.
* Added <code>minecraft:flowers</code> and <code>minecraft:tall_flowers</code> item tags.

'''Textures'''
* Added textures for a wax block and crystallized honey item.
** These are unobtainable in-game. See [[History_of_textures/Unused_textures#Wax_block|history of unused textures.]]

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Crafting table]]'''
* When the GUI is opened, {{key|Shift}} + clicking an item or a stack in the [[inventory]] now transfers it directly into the crafting grid.

'''[[Dispenser]]'''
* Can now harvest [[honeycomb]]s when dispensing [[shears]] on [[bee nest]]s and [[bee hive]]s filled with honey.
** The honeycomb items are dropped on the ground.
* Can now collect [[honey bottle]]s when dispensing [[glass bottle]]s on bee hives.
* Can now collect [[water bottle]]s when dispensing glass bottles on [[water]].

'''[[Redstone comparator]]'''
* Can now detect how much honey is inside bee hives and bee nests.
** The output strength is equal to the amount of honey in the hive.

=== General ===
'''Game library updates'''
* ''Minecraft'' now requires OpenGL 2.0.

'''Rendering updates'''
* Partially implemented [[Java Edition mentioned features#Blaze3D|Blaze3D]].
