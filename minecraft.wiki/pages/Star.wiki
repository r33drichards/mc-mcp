'''Stars''' are celestial bodies that appear in the night sky of the [[Overworld]].

== Mechanics ==
Stars are randomly generated. The generator makes 1500 attempts to generate a star, which can succeed or fail. The seed used by the generator is always 10842, therefore the game always generates the same pattern of stars.

There are no textures for stars. Stars are rendered as white colored squares.

Like the [[sun]] and the [[moon]], stars slowly move across the sky as time passes. Relative positions between stars, the sun, and the moon do not change.

Opacity and lightness of stars are affected by the [[daylight cycle]]. Stars begin to be visible starting at 11576 ticks, reaching maximum brightness at 13219 ticks, and begin fading at 22782 ticks, reaching minimum visibility at 425 ticks.

The side length of a star is randomly generated, and the size fluctuates between 0.3 and 0.5 units.

Stars are visible only when the [[weather]] is clear and not when "Beatiful Skies" is disabled.

== List of stars ==
The following table lists all 780 stars in the sky.

The world time used by declination and right ascension is 0, the declination of the east is 0°, and the sun is at (0°, 0°), and the moon is at (180°, 0°).

; Number (No.)
: The order of the star is generated by the generator.
; Declination (Dec)
: The declination of the star on the celestial sphere.
; Right ascension (Ra)
: The right ascension of the star on the celestial sphere.
; Rotation (Rot)
: The clockwise rotation of the star.
; Scale
: The radius of the star.
