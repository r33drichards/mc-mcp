[[File:Creative.png|thumb|right|[[wikipedia:Pixel art|Pixel art]], [[structure]]s and other creations made in Creative mode.]]

'''Creative mode''' is one of the main [[game mode]]s in {{MC}}. Creative mode strips away the survival aspects of ''Minecraft'' and allows [[player]]s to easily create and destroy [[structure]]s and mechanisms with the inclusion of an infinite use of [[block]]s and [[flying]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, it disables the player's ability to earn [[achievement]]s. It also has unique background [[music]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Fly.png|right|thumb|A player flying in Creative mode.]]

=== Destroying ===
Creative mode allows [[player]]s to destroy all blocks instantly (including normally indestructible blocks such as [[bedrock]], [[end portal frame]]s, etc.), provided they are not holding a [[sword]], [[trident]], [[mace]], or [[debug stick]]{{only|java|short=1}}.

When continuously holding {{ctrl|destroy}} to break blocks in Creative mode, there is a 6 [[game tick]] (0.3 second) cooldown between each block broken. This is distinct from [[instant mining]] in Survival mode, where one block can be broken every game tick (0.05 second). This cooldown can be bypassed by rapidly clicking the {{ctrl|destroy}} button, allowing blocks to be broken as quickly as the player clicks.

Blocks directly broken by the player do not drop any resource; the only exceptions are [[shulker box]]es and [[beehive]]s if they have non-default NBT data which drop themselves when broken, and containers (excluding [[shulker box]]es) will drop their contents when broken. Blocks broken indirectly (for example, a torch attached to the block that is being broken, or blocks destroyed by an explosion) drop item resources as in other game modes. [[Infested block]]s do not spawn silverfish when destroyed directly by the player.

==== Interaction range ====
{{main|Interaction range}}
Players in Creative have a longer interaction range (reach) for placing, destroying, and attacking than in Survival.

=== Flying ===
{{Main|Flying}}

Creative mode gives players [[Flying|the ability to fly]]. To activate flying, double tap the {{Control|jump}} key. Use the jump key to go up and the {{Control|sneak}} key to go down, and the {{control|move|text=movement}} controls to move. The player can disable flying in mid-air by double-tapping {{Control|jump}} again or {{Control|sneak}} (on touch devices only), causing them to drop to the ground. Touching the ground when flying disables flying {{In|je}}, but not {{In|be}}. Getting into a [[minecart]], or [[bed]] does not disable flying. However, getting into a boat or riding a mob such as [[pig]], [[llama]], [[horse]], [[donkey]], [[mule]], [[skeleton horse]], [[strider]], [[trader llama]], or [[camel]] disables flying.

=== Invincibility ===
In Creative mode, players have no visible [[health]] or [[hunger]] bar to hamper their building since they are invincible (though it is still possible to eat).

Players in Creative mode are unable to receive [[damage]] from the vast majority of sources. {{IN|java}}, going too far into the [[void]] still kills the player; however, {{in|bedrock}}, the player is also immune to this (they are stopped by an invisible barrier that exists in all three dimensions). The player can fly around in the void provided they do not descend [[Altitude|more than 64 blocks below the bottom of the dimension]]. {{IN|je}}, the void, the {{cmd|kill}} and {{cmd|damage}} commands, as well as [[Mods|external editors]], are the only way to die in Creative mode. Creative players {{in|be}} are completely invulnerable.

=== Mobs ===
[[Mob]]s still spawn as they do in other game modes, unless the [[difficulty]] is Peaceful or when the [[game rule]] <code>doMobSpawning</code> is set to <code>false</code>, but all are passive toward the players. [[Zombie]]s summoned by others calling for backup attempt to attack the player, but they still cause no harm, and they stop attacking after several seconds. The player can still ignite [[creeper]]s with a [[flint and steel]] or [[fire charge]]. Mobs killed by the player in Creative still drop items, but most other entities do not.

=== Items ===
Some [[item]]s behave differently in Creative mode. Items do not disappear or lose [[durability]] when {{Control|used}}. For example, putting an item in an [[item frame]], on an [[armor stand]], or in a [[decorated pot]] does not cause it to disappear from the player's hand. Instead, the item is duplicated. It is the same for putting on [[armor]] by right-clicking it from the player's hotbar. Also, empty buckets simply make liquids disappear, similarly to the other liquid filled buckets, which don't lose water and can be placed infinitely.

[[Item (entity)|Item entities]] can be picked up by the player, but if the hotbar is already full, the items go into the [[Survival]] inventory. If the survival inventory is full as well, the items are deleted even though they appear to be picked up.

=== Pick block ===
The player can obtain items using {{Control|pick block}}. Unlike Survival, the block selected appears in the player's hotbar even if the block is not already in the hotbar or in the Survival inventory. If it is in the inventory, then the block moves out of its former slot and replaces the block/item in the active hotbar slot, with the size of the stack preserved. If the hotbar is full then the selected block replaces the block/item in the active slot.

Most blocks give the player a copy of themselves when using {{Control|pick block}}. Using it on an item frame gives the player the item held inside, or the item frame itself if no item is held. Using it on a mob gives the player a spawn egg of that mob. Using it on a [[mob head]] gives the mob type that it is; using it on custom heads gives only the mob type that was used in the [[command]], but without the custom skin.

If the player holds {{Key|Control}} and presses {{Control|pick block}}, in addition to obtaining the item, it also preserves the block's [[NBT format|NBT tags]], allowing the player to place an identical copy of the block; this allows the player to duplicate items inside of chests, dispensers, and so on, and also duplicates the text on [[sign]]s.

=== Switching to Creative mode ===
Once a world is created, if [[cheats]] are enabled, the game mode can be manually changed to Creative (or other game modes) with the {{Cmd|gamemode}} command, specifically by typing {{Cmd|gamemode creative}}. {{IN|java}}, the game mode switcher ({{key|F3+F4}}) can also be used. In [[multiplayer]], players can be individually changed between game modes with the {{Cmd|gamemode}} command available to [[operator]]s. This means that individual players can play Creative mode (at the operator's discretion) on a [[Survival]] map, or vice-versa. The default game mode for new players can also be changed with the {{Cmd|defaultgamemode}} command.

=== Achievements ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, opening a new Creative world or opening an existing world in Creative permanently disables [[achievements]] or trophies for that particular game, but has no other effects on [[gameplay]]. In other words, achievements/trophies work only in games that have never been in Creative.

== Creative inventory ==
{{main|Creative inventory}}
[[File:Minecraft Creative.png|right|thumb|The Creative mode inventory showing the Search tab for the ''Java Edition''.]]
[[File:BECreativeInventory.png|right|thumb|The Creative mode inventory showing the All tab in Bedrock Edition (Classic option).]]
[[File:BECreativeInventory (Pocket).png|right|thumb|The Creative mode inventory showing the All tab in Bedrock Edition (Pocket option).]]

In Creative, the normal [[Inventory|inventory screen]] is replaced by the [[Creative inventory|item selection screen]], which contains almost all [[block]]s and [[item]]s (with [[Creative inventory#Unavailable blocks and items|some exceptions]]) in a tabbed interface. Some items and blocks are [[Creative inventory#Creative inventory exclusives|exclusively]] available only in Creative mode, such as [[spawn egg]]s. Likewise, some blocks can be {{Control|placed}} or {{Control|used}} only in Creative with [[operator]] permission, such as [[command block]]s and [[structure block]]s. {{IN|java}}, items currently in the hotbar can be saved to later be loaded in the "[[Saved Hotbars]]" menu.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{IN|Java}}, there are 13 (14 if Operator Utilities tab is enabled in settings) tabs that are ordered from top-left to bottom-right as: 

* {{InvSprite|Bricks|scale=0.5|text=Building Blocks}}
* {{InvSprite|Cyan Wool|scale=0.5|text=Colored Blocks}}
* {{InvSprite|Grass Block|scale=0.5|text=Natural Blocks}}
* {{InvSprite|Oak Sign|scale=0.5|text=Functional Blocks}}
* {{InvSprite|Redstone Dust|scale=0.5|text=Redstone Blocks}}
* {{InvSprite|Bookshelf|scale=0.5|text=[[Saved Hotbars]]}}
* {{InvSprite|Compass|scale=0.5|text=Search Items}}
* {{InvSprite|Diamond Pickaxe|scale=0.5|text=Tools & Utilities}}
* {{InvSprite|Netherite Sword|scale=0.5|text=Combat}}
* {{InvSprite|Golden Apple|scale=0.5|text=Food & Drinks}}
* {{InvSprite|Iron Ingot|scale=0.5|text=Ingredients}}
* {{InvSprite|Creeper Spawn Egg|scale=0.5|text=Spawn Eggs}}
* {{InvSprite|Command Block|scale=0.5|text=Operator Utilities}} (Needs to be enabled in settings)
* {{InvSprite|Chest|scale=0.5|text=Survival Inventory}}

In ''Java Edition'', there is a "destroy item" button, where items can be dragged to and deleted. {{Key|shift}} + clicking on the button clears the entire inventory, including the hotbar, off-hand slot, and armor slots.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
{{IN|Bedrock}}, there are 5 tabs:

*{{InvSprite|Bricks|scale=0.5|text=Construction}} 
*{{InvSprite|Diamond Sword|scale=0.5|text=Equipment}} 
*{{InvSprite|Red Bed|scale=0.5|text=Items}} 
*{{InvSprite|Grass Block|scale=0.5|text=Nature}} 
*{{InvSprite|Compass|scale=0.5|text=All}}

When using the "Classic" UI profile, the buttons in the top right corner can toggle the inventory screen to show:
* only the Creative inventory
* both the Creative and the Survival inventory
* only the Survival inventory

When using the "Pocket" UI profile, it is not possible to display both the Creative and the Survival inventory at the same time; the Creative inventory, however, can be shrunk to also display the [[2×2 grid|2×2 crafting grid]] or the equipment slots using the tabs on the right side of the screen.

=== Platform specific exclusive features ===
Some blocks and items are obtainable in Creative on one platform, but not the other. The full list of blocks and items obtainable only in the ''Java Edition'' Creative Inventory can be found in [[Java Edition exclusive features#Creative inventory]]. ''Bedrock Edition'' exclusive Creative Inventory blocks and items can be found in [[Bedrock Edition exclusive features#Creative inventory]].

== Representation in <samp>level.dat</samp> ==
{{Main|level.dat}}

Creative mode is represented as <code>1</code> in <code>GameType</code> in the <samp>level.dat</samp> file; to manually change the <code>GameType</code>, the file must first be opened with an [[Programs and editors/Specialized programs|external NBT editor]].

Note: [[Singleplayer]] worlds do not use this field to save the game mode the player is currently in.
