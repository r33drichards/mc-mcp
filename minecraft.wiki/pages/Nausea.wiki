'''Nausea''' is an [[effect]] that warps and wobbles the [[player]]'s vision similar to a [[nether portal]]. The effect does not change its power as its potency changes. It can be obtained only from eating a [[Pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]] or a [[suspicious stew]] crafted with a [[closed eyeblossom]]. Drinking [[Milk Bucket|milk]] removes the effect. {{IN|Bedrock|Education}}, it can also be cured with [[tonic]].

== Effect ==
Nausea causes the [[player]]'s vision to warp and wobble, with the distortion ramping up and down at the start and end of the effect. Although Nausea can be given in the normal range of levels, the level has no impact; it does not affect the distortion. 

Nausea is affected by the "Distortion Effects" option under [[video settings]] or [[accessibility settings]]. As the distortion effects values is lowered, the nausea effect is increasingly replaced by a green [[screen effect]] around the edges of the screen. At lower values the warp and wobble effect is lesser and the green overlay effect is greater, and vice versa. At 100%, the green overlay is entirely disabled, and at "Off" (0%), the distortion is entirely disabled.

The effect can be removed by drinking [[Milk Bucket|milk]]. {{IN|education|bedrock}} (when education options are enabled), drinking [[tonic]] also removes nausea.
