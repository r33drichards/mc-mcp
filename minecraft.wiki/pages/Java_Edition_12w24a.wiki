'''12w24a''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] released for [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], released on June 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615002327/https://www.mojang.com/2012/06/minecraft-snapshot-week-24/|title=Minecraft Snapshot Week 24|date = June 14, 2012|author=Jens Bergensten}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[LAN]]'''
* Allowed those connected to a [[player]]'s LAN network to join [[singleplayer]] games.
* The player can now use {{cmd|publish}} to open their singleplayer game for LAN players to join. This is still very much work in progress, so it lacks some necessary settings such as what game mode players get, and if they should be able to use cheats or not. 
* The {{cmd|publish}} command is temporary, since the player cannot even access it if they have not enabled cheats (LAN connections will be GUI based in the future).

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|tp}}'''
* Added the command from [[multiplayer]] to singleplayer.
* Allows teleporting between players.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Ender_Chest_(S)_JE1_BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Ender chest]]s'''
* Now has an [[inventory]] per player and not per world.
* Breaking it drops 8 [[obsidian]], unless the player has [[Silk Touch]] enchantment.

{{Animate|Ceiling_Lever_(N)_JE3.png;Ceiling_Lever_(W)_JE3.png;Powered_Ceiling_Lever_(N)_JE3.png|36px}} '''[[Lever]]s'''
* The player can now place [[lever]]s on the underside of [[block]]s, and upside-down.

=== Items ===
'''Tools'''
* [[Breaking]] a block that can be [[instant mining|instantly mined]] by hand ([[short grass]], [[torch]], etc.) while holding a tool no longer reduces the tool's [[durability]].

=== General ===
'''[[Language]] files'''
* [[End portal frame]]s now have a tooltip.

== Fixes ==
'''16 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed [[ender pearl]]s and [[eye of ender]] not aligning properly in the [[inventory]].
* Fixed the double [[chest]] GUI having the caption "Large Chest" in all languages.
* Fixed the "Destroy Item" tooltip appearing in other pages of the inventory occasionally.
* Partially remedied bug when Minecraft does not save the [[player]]'s progress, stops generating [[chunk]]s, and freezes all the [[mob]]s. This still occurs sometimes.
* Fixed the [[ender dragon]] not dealing any [[damage]] to the player after it has been hit once.
* Fixed [[explosion]]s not pushing back players.
* Fixed [[bucket]]s not picking up or placing [[water]] within the spawn protection.
* Fixed losing the items in the second trade box if the player exits a trade with a [[villager]].
* Fixed missing [[sound]]s:
** Fixed water-movement sound.
** Fixed [[fire]] sound.
** Fixed extinguish sound.
** Fixed [[nether portal]] sound.
** Fixed [[lava]]-stagnant sound.
** Fixed lava-droplet sound.
* Fixed attempting to use a [[tripwire hook]] when right clicking.
* The [[texture pack]] folder button now works on Mac.</onlyinclude>
