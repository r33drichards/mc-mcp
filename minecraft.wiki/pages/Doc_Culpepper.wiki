'''Doc Culpepper''' is a mysterious individual within ''[[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles]]'' and its sequels, responsible for inventing the [[VR goggles]].

== Appearance ==
Culpepper is a wide, pale skinned woman with short yet messy hair, evoking traditional scientists like {{Wikipedia|Albert Einstein}}, except seemingly not grayed. Her face is round, with long eyelashes and a visible beauty mark on her right cheek. Her clothes consist of a visibly damaged white lab coat, what appears to be either an apron or a dress with a pocket holding pens, and checkerboard pants similar in pattern to one used on the VR goggles.

== Powers and abilities ==
Through unknown means, Culpepper is able to build incredibly advanced technology capable of folding space and time. Her most notable creation are a set of goggles, considerably thinner than VR headsets of the time, which are able to enter psychic travel into a presumably digital ''Minecraft'' reality. This technology is miraculous enough that many suspect it to be supernatural, while others accuse her of even greater inventions, such as a time portal or some sort of experiment involving [[Bats (Woodsword Chronicles)|bats]].
