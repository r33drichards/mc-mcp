'''Soul sand''' is a block found primarily in [[the Nether]] that slows down [[entities]] walking on it unless they are wearing [[Soul Speed]] boots. It can also be used to grow [[Nether wart]], create [[soul fire]], and make upward [[bubble column]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Soul sand can be mined with any [[tool]] or by hand, but [[shovel]]s are the quickest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Soul Sand|shovel}}

=== Natural generation ===
Soul sand generates most abundantly in [[soul sand valley]]s, where it and [[soul soil]] make up the surface terrain. It is also found below Y=34 in the [[Nether wastes]] along the shores of [[lava sea]]s, generally in four-block-deep layers.

Soul sand can generate in the Nether in the form of [[ore (feature)|ore blob]]s. Soul sand attempts to generate 12 times per chunk in blobs of size 0 to 23 at altitudes from 0 to 31{{only|java|short=1}} or 32{{only|bedrock|short=1}} in [[soul sand valley]]s. It can replace only [[netherrack]].

Soul sand is found naturally in Nether wart rooms of [[Nether fortress]]es. It also generates in hoglin stables and housing unit [[bastion remnant]]s.

Soul sand is also found in [[ancient cities]], the only location with soul sand in the [[Overworld]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|soul-sand}}

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s have approximately an 8.53% ({{frac|40|469}}) chance to [[barter]] 2–8 soul sand when given a [[gold ingot]].

== Usage ==
[[File:Soulsand-cover.png|thumb|The slowing and sinking effect of soul sand is canceled depending on the height of the solid block directly above it. (Note: The snow behind the example blocks is for visual reference. Each layer of [[snow]] represents one-eighth of a full block high.)]]

Movement on or just above soul sand is slowed down for any [[mob]] or player that is not wearing [[boots]] enchanted with [[Soul Speed]] by approximately 41.91% (i.e. a player's speed is 2.508 m/s with no [[Speed]] or [[Slowness]] effects), and standing on soul sand causes entities to [[Solid block#Height|sink 2 pixels]] (or 0.125 blocks) into the block. A cover with solid blocks of any non-zero physical thickness prevents sinking, and any solid cover thicker than half a block also eliminates the slowing effect.

The effect applies to sneaking, walking, sprinting, and crawling (but not gliding), and to both regular and sprint-swimming. It also applies to riding mounts. Travel by boat is also slowed, although this requires water no more than 2/8 a block in depth for the boat to sit low enough to be affected. Furthermore, it does not matter whether the player or mob moves actively or is being moved, like by flowing water.

Most blocks that can be placed on full blocks can be placed on soul sand, with the exceptions of both types of [[Nether fungi]], [[crimson roots]], [[warped roots]], and [[Nether sprouts]].<ref>{{bug|MC-191255}}</ref> In addition, a [[falling block]] that lands on soul sand turns into an [[item (entity)|item]],<ref>{{bug|MC-77079|||WAI}}</ref> which prevents [[gravel]] from replacing lava if soul sand is underneath.

A [[hopper]] underneath a soul sand block can collect items that are dropped on it.

Soul sand cannot be used in place of regular [[sand]] as a falling block because it is not affected by gravity.

[[Strider]]s are slowed down by soul sand underneath a layer of lava.

Soul sand has a height of <sup>14</sup>⁄<sub>16</sub> of a block. 

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Growing Nether wart ===

Soul sand is used for growing [[Nether wart]], a primary base ingredient for many types of potions. Nether warts can be placed on soul sand and grow through four growth stages over time. Placing Nether wart on soul sand grants the "A Seedy Place" advancement{{only|java}}. Nether wart can grow in any dimension and does not have any light level requirements. Nether wart can also be placed only in soul sand, not [[soul soil]].{{FakeImage|align=right|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|w=Wither Skeleton Skull|s=+Soul Sand|www|sss| s }}|The wither build configuration.}}

=== Withers ===
Four blocks of soul sand (or [[soul soil]]) are used to construct the [[wither]]. The four blocks are arranged in a "T"-like formation (similar to the summoning of an [[iron golem]]) and 3 [[wither skeleton skull]]s are placed in a row on top of the "T" to summon the wither.

=== Bubble columns ===
Placing soul sand under source [[water]] blocks creates a [[Bubble Column#Upward|lifting bubble column]], which causes items, entities, players, and mobs inside the column to rise to the surface. The bubble column extends upward through any number of empty water source blocks (not [[waterlogging|waterlogged]] blocks).[[File:Ancient city centre soul fire.png|thumb|Soul fire generating on soul sand in an ancient city.]]A player can restore breath by entering a soul sand bubble column.

=== Note blocks ===
Soul sand can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce cowbell sounds.
=== Fire ===
Fire lit on soul sand becomes [[soul fire]], which burns indefinitely.

Because soul sand is not as high as a full [[block]], a player is set on fire if standing next to lava while on soul sand.<ref>{{bug|MC-1448||Entities standing on mud or soul sand next to lava are set on fire and take damage}}</ref> Standing near water while on soul sand extinguishes the player.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Soul sand has inner collision boxes every eighth of a block. However, these collision boxes have an effect only if entities are clipped into soul sand.
* If a [[water]] current is pushing the player diagonally against a wall and soul sand is the block adjacent to the player's head when the current ends, it causes the player to jump.
*Just like with other blocks of less than full height that can have (flowing) water above it, riding a boat on dry soul sand into an oncoming stream of flowing water leaves the boat itself on the sand while the player character is "carved" out of the boat by the water "blade".
* Before [[Village & Pillage]], soul sand used to generate in iconic four-block-deep layers between y levels 60 and 65. It also occasionally generated on the floor of caverns and coasts of lava oceans below, only if it generated in the same column at Y=60 or above. Toward the end of Village & Pillage development, the generation range of soul sand was reduced so that it exists only below y level 34, close to the lava sea level. As a result, soul sand is much harder to find in Nethers that were generated in the 1.14 and 1.15 versions.
