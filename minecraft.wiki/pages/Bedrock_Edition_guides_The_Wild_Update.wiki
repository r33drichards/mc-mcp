This guide is a simplified overview of all changes in [[The Wild Update]] update ({{BE}} 1.19.x releases), which assumes at least some familiarity with the [[Caves & Cliffs]] updates (''Bedrock Edition'' 1.17.x and ''Bedrock Edition'' 1.18.x releases).

== Mobs ==
=== New ===
{|{{Simple Guide table|New Mobs}}
|-
| [[Warden]]
| [[File:Warden.gif|84px]]
| Summoned when a player triggers a natural [[sculk shrieker]] four times.
| 
* {{Drop|Block|Sculk Catalyst|1}}
* {{xp|1|3}} (when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]])
|
* The first fully-blind mob. In order to find a target, it relies on vibrations, smell, and contact.
* Rises out of the floor when summoned. Digs back into the ground when it reverts back to a calm state and doesn't detect a vibration in 60 seconds.
* Has the highest health out of all mobs in ''Java Edition''.
* Is immune to fire, lava, and knockback.
* A warden starts out searching for a target, slowly getting more agitated as it gets more suspicious of a mob. When agitated, it roars and then pursues the target.
* A warden instantly becomes agitated when hit by another mob.
* Wardens possess an extremely powerful melee attack, which can also disable shields.
* Targets that are still being pursued, but are out-of-reach for its melee attack, will be hit with a ranged sonic boom attack, which bypasses shields and armor.

* Spawns when a tadpole grows up.
* Frogs have three color variations, each depending on the temperature of the biome it spawns in. Temperate biomes spawn orange frogs, cold biomes spawn green frogs, and warm biomes spawn white frogs.
* Eats tiny [[slime]]s to produce slime balls.
* Eats tiny [[magma cube]]s to produce [[froglight]]s. The type of frog influences the froglight's color.

* [[Woodland mansion]]
* [[Pillager outpost]]
| None
