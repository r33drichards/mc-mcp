'''1.3''' is the first and only pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.3.1]], released on July 26, 2012.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/www.mojang.com/2012/07/the-weekly-chunk-minecraft-1-3-prerelease/</ref>

Unlike most versions, which have such content automatically stripped out, this version contains unused (but obfuscated) code for many unimplemented features, such as a biome previewer, prototype villages, and content relating to unimplemented entities and some aspects of world generation.
