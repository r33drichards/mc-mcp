'''0.0.17a'''<ref>https://youtu.be/e_Q1JbCDirE</ref> is a version of [[Java Edition Classic]] released on June 10, 2009, shortly after 19:16 UTC, which added {{cmd|setspawn}} command for admins, made changes to multiplayer and fixes bugs.<ref>{{link |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212003344/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/121313306/client-0017a-server-13|title=Client 0.0.17a, server 1.3 |website=The Word of Notch |date=June 10, 2009, 19:16:57 UTC}}</ref> This version is not available in the launcher, but has been archived elsewhere.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* List logged-in players when {{key|Tab}} is pressed in [[multiplayer]].

'''[[Commands]]'''
* {{cmd|setspawn}}
** Sets the current location as the default [[World Spawn|spawn]] location for new [[players]].
** Only for admins.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* Server-side client verification in [[server.properties]].
** Set this to false would allow players to connect directly via <code><nowiki>http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?ip=<ip>&port=<port></nowiki></code>.
* Added <code>logged-in.txt</code> on the server.
* Players can no longer spam ping requests.
* Private server addresses changed behavior.
** The server generates an <code>externalurl.txt</code> when run now.

'''[[Chat]]'''
* Log appears when typing.
* Chat is disabled in [[singleplayer]].

=== General ===
'''[[Font]]'''
* The characters <code>0</code> and <code>O</code> now display differently.

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* Fully fixed {{cmd|banip}} (it was working, but not intuitive.)
* Fix spawn location to default at log in.
* Server flood exploits prevention.
** Players now get kicked if they place a block not available through legitimate gameplay.
** Players now get kicked if they place a block further than allowed through legitimate gamplay.
* No more [[lava]] floods.

== Trivia ==
* Client.jar file of this version is compiled at 20:14 UTC, but [[Java Edition Classic server 1.3|the server version]] was compiled at 19:45 UTC.
** It might mean that 0.0.17a is actually released at same time with server version and later reuploaded, or it was intentionally released later for unknown reasons.
