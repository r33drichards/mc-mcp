'''Allow''' and '''deny''' are blocks that can be used to create restricted building areas or areas where [[player]]s can build.<ref>https://educommunity.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047116852-Specialty-Blocks-Allow-Deny-Border-Structure-</ref>

== Obtaining ==
Allow and deny blocks can either be obtained by using the pick block [[control]], or by using various [[commands]], such as {{cmd|give}}, or the [[Creative inventory]]{{only|edu}}.

== Usage ==
When placed, allow blocks let [[player]]s without world builder status place or destroy blocks in the area above them if immutable world is on, while deny blocks prohibit players without world builder, and their [[agent]]s, from placing or destroying blocks in the area above them. This area covers an infinite distance above the block but does not cover the area below the block. If two allow or deny blocks are placed on top of one another, the block that is highest takes precedence. The deny block does not prevent the placing of blocks through commands, [[endermen]], or [[piston]]s. They also do not prevent the placing of entities such as [[boat]]s.

{{IN|BE}}, when placed, allow blocks let players in [[Adventure]] status place or destroy blocks in the area above, while deny blocks prohibit [[Permission level|Members]] in [[Survival]] from placing or destroying blocks in the area above them.

Both blocks are extremely resistant to [[explosion]]s, and players with world builder (or [[permission level]] 1{{only|BE}}) status are able to place and destroy blocks regardless of where any allow or deny blocks are placed and can also destroy and place the blocks themselves.

Allow blocks do not enable players without building/destroying permissions to build on top of them.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Allow and deny blocks cannot be moved by [[piston]]s or [[sticky piston]]s.
