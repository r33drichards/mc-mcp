A '''zoglin''' is an [[undead]] [[hostile mob]] created when a [[hoglin]] is out of the [[Nether]] for too long. It never retreats or flees, and attacks [[player]]s and almost all non-zoglin [[mob]]s indiscriminately, using the same tusk attack as its non-zombified counterpart.

== Spawning ==
Zoglins spawn when a [[hoglin]] has been out of the [[Nether]] for {{convert|300|ticks|seconds}}. For their first 10 seconds after zombification, they get the {{EffectLink||id=nausea}} [[Nausea]] effect{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>This does not happen in Bedrock Edition due to {{bug|MCPE-70866}}.</ref>. This nausea effect is cosmetic and does not affect its behavior.

Like most [[hostile]] mobs, zoglins despawn when the [[difficulty]] is changed to [[Peaceful]].

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Both adult and baby zoglins share the following item drop table:
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Rotten Flesh|quantity=1-3|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* {{xp|5}} if killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Zoglins are hostile toward [[armor stand]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-177122||Zoglins try to attack armor stands|Works As Intended}}</ref>, [[camera]]s{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}}, players in [[Adventure]] or [[Survival]] mode, and all mobs except [[agent]]s, [[creeper]]s, [[ghast]]s, and other zoglins. This includes hoglins and zombified piglins. Normal hoglins do not attack zoglins unless provoked by zoglins.<!--Aggressive to any entity that extends the "LivingEntity" class, which includes armor stands. This does not include things like minecarts or item frames.-->

When an adult zoglin attacks, it flings its target into the air{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>This does not happen in Bedrock Edition due to {{bug|MCPE-74465}}.</ref>. [[Blocking]] with a [[shield]] does not mitigate this. When a baby zoglin attacks, they do not fling their target. Baby zoglins, unlike baby [[hoglin]]s, never grow up. Any mob that can retaliate attacks a zoglin in return after being attacked, including baby zoglins.

{{IN|je}}, adult zoglins attack once every two seconds and babies attack every second. {{IN|be}}, both adults and babies attack once every second.

When a zoglin attacks a [[piglin]], the piglin either retreats or fights back. [[Piglin brute]]s attack zoglins if they are attacked first and never retreat. They also attack the zoglin if the zoglin attacks a piglin or another piglin brute.

Like hoglins, zoglins can be leashed. If a player has a zoglin on a lead, then the zoglin still attacks other entities who get within its attack range, but does not actively pursue and attack the player leading it.{{only|java|short=1}}

Zoglins are incapable of [[breeding]] and do not flee from [[Tag#blocks hoglin repellents|blocks that repel hoglins]]. Unlike baby [[hoglin]]s, baby zoglins attack baby [[piglin]]s. [[Piglin]]s flee from zoglins if they are not engaged in combat.

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* ignored by the [[wither]].
* affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* a threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Like [[zombified piglin]]s, they are immune to [[fire]] and [[lava]].

If a hoglin is fed [[crimson fungus]] before it is zombified, the resulting zoglin does not despawn naturally and it does not count toward the mob cap.

== Trivia ==
* While [[zombified piglin]]s can spawn naturally with their unzombified variant, zoglins cannot. As a result, these mobs are the only Nether-classified mobs that must be created in the [[Overworld]] or [[The End]] in order to exist, with the exception of the [[happy ghast]], and if the zoglins spawns in the nether, they would attack everything around them, which would disrupt the atmosphere.
* The zoglin's behavior resembles a [[Vindicator|vindicator]] named "Johnny".
