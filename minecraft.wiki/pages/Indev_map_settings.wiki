[[File:Indev.png|thumbnail|right|The "Floating" level type.]]
'''Indev map settings''' refer to map settings added in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100106]] and [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100107]], which allows to control level type, shape, size and theme.

== Options ==
=== Level type ===
The level type refers to the general format the level generator used to create maps. It dramatically affected gameplay, such as the availability of water, sand and gravel. The further the player traveled toward the end of the map, the slower they moved. 

There were four kinds of map types:
* "Island" was the default level type featuring minor hills and liquid existing at the borders.
* "Floating" was similar to the floating islands in the more recent "[[Buffet]]" world type from 1.13 to 1.17 — it contained multiple floating islands. Falling from these islands resulted in death as the surface was covered in bedrock. Floating gravel and sand was common, while water was rare.
* "Flat" was similar to the "[[Superflat]]" world type today — it featured flat grass with flowers, trees and a starting house.
* "Inland" featured a slightly hilly landscape, which was essentially the "Island" level type with infinite flat land at its borders as opposed to water. Sand and gravel were common.

=== Level shape and size ===
The level shape refers to the general dimensions the level generator used to create maps. It was added in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100106|Indev 0.31 20100106]] and it altered the length, width, and height of the map.

There were three kinds of shapes:
* "Square" was a map of equal length and width, with a height of 64 blocks.
* "Long" was 2 times the length and {{frac|1|2}} times the width of a square map.
* "Deep" was 4 times the height and {{frac|1|2}} times the width and length of a square map.

There were three kinds of sizes:

=== Level themes ===
The level theme refers to the general style the level generator used to create maps. It dramatically affected game mechanics, such as monster spawn zones and boundary liquid. These themes were comparable to the newer idea of [[biome]]s, although they applied to the entire map instead of just a select area.

==== Normal ====
"Normal" was the default level theme. Above ground, one would find sporadic trees and generally favorable space. The weather was constantly partly cloudy, and the lengths of night and day were equal. Underground, ores of all types could be found and lava was generally found near the [[bedrock]] layer. The boundary liquid was water.

==== Hell ====
{{main|Hell (map theme)}}
"Hell" was the second level theme introduced within the map theme feature. Hell featured significantly less [[light]]ing during the day, where [[mob]]s of all types would spawn at any time. All water was replaced with lava, grass was replaced with [[dirt]] and grass would spawn in place of sand only during map generation. Mushrooms were abundant on the surface. [[Farming]] worked at a much slower rate (one plant stage per day cycle). This level theme was comparable to the later added [[Nether]]. The boundary liquid was lava.

==== Paradise ====
The third level theme, "Paradise", was more relaxed than the other themes. It featured larger beaches and plentiful flora compared to the "Normal" theme, and the time is always set to "Noon" (the sun never sets); hostile mobs spawn only underground. Farming works at a much faster rate (from planting to harvestable in 30–45 minutes). The boundary liquid was water.

==== Woods ====
The fourth level theme, "Woods", was a middle-ground of challenge between "Normal" and "Hell". It provided constant overcast during the day that reduces light, and tree density was higher than the other themes, resulting in the land space becoming smaller. Additionally, mushrooms were spotty throughout the above-ground areas. The boundary liquid was water.
