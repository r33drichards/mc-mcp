== Experience details ==
The event is an hour-long, interactive, in-person adventure where participants in groups of 25 go through a mission and scavenger hunt through multiple ''[[Minecraft]]'' [[Biome|biomes]] and dimensions to rescue [[Villager|villagers]]. Mobs such as [[skeleton]]s and [[creeper]]s can be encountered, ore can be mined, and ingredients can be foraged.<ref name="minecraftexperience.com"/> Guests must cure as many villagers as possible using the ingredients they collect in the 7 rooms.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.lapresse.ca/arts/2024-06-04/experience-multimedia/un-studio-quebecois-a-la-conquete-de-minecraft.php|title=Un studio québécois à la conquête de Minecraft|author=Stéphanie Morin|website=La Presse|date=June 4, 2024}}</ref> The world is created using displays in tall projection walls and floors which can be interacted with using orbs of interaction and motion detection.<ref name="YT">{{ytl|9pF_VGP7NVA|Minecraft Live 2024: Minecraft Experience &vert; Villager Rescue|Minecraft|September 30, 2024}} on YouTube</ref>

=== Walkthrough ===
{{Spoiler Warning|section|Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue}}

==== Entrance / registration ====
The experience begins with employees registering Orbs of Interaction for assigned groups and handing them to guests. Guests are then directed to a video led by Dayo and Tobin, two original characters created specifically for the Minecraft Experience, who explain how to use the Orb of Interaction throughout.

==== Forest ====
The first room guests encounter is the Forest, acting as a temporary holding zone and tutorial area for the use of the Orb of Interaction. Two displays allow guests to chop wood and fight mobs (in addition to Dayo and Tobin). Adjacent to the display areas is an interactive floor containing cherry blossoms and randomly spawned apples for guests to collect. Within the room itself are several life-size mobs that guests are able to take photos with (said mobs being two pigs, an Iron Golem, a Creeper, and a Chicken).

''Village Gate''

Near the chicken is a sign that says 'Village' and a gate into the next section, referred to as the 'Village Gate'. An employee prevents guests from entering the Village too early, as three groups of guests are allowed entry into the Forest at a time. Every six minutes, one of the group's Orbs of Interaction turns green and begins to vibrate, indicating that it is time to move on to the next room.

==== Village ====
Guests enter a room containing an interactive table featuring illustrations of 6 different villages, each containing a village within a different biome. Guests must interact with the screens to gather resources and build structures within the village, as Dayo and Tobin do. As night falls, a [[zombie siege]] begins, and the villagers become zombified. Dayo and Tobin explain to guests that they must cure the villagers using a [[splash potion of Weakness]] and a [[golden apple]]. They provide a list of items needed and their respective locations:
* The swamp:
** {{BlockLink|Brown Mushroom}}
** {{ItemLink|Sugar Cane}}
* The snowy biome:
** {{ItemLink|Golden apple}}
** {{ItemLink|Snowball}}
* The underground:
** {{ItemLink|Gunpowder}}
** {{ItemLink|Spider eye}}
* The Nether:
** {{ItemLink|Blaze rod}}

==== 'Explore' room ====
Guests enter a room depicting a swamp / jungle biome. Sugar cane grows along the walls for guests to break, which then spawns several sugar cane items that can be picked up. Brown mushrooms also spawn periodically on the floor. Near the exit to the next room, a [[Hanging Sign]] depicts how many of either item have been collected. A panda is also interactable within the room, causing hearts to appear when the orb is used near it. After a set amount of time, the room then shifts to a snowy plains / snowy taiga biome. Similar to the previous room, snow blocks generate along the walls for guests to break, dropping snowballs. Snowballs also spawn on the floor for guests to pick up. Chests on each wall also appear, opening to reveal apples and golden apples that drop on the floor for guests to collect. Similar to the panda in the previous area, snow foxes are within the room, also able to be 'pet' by guests, once again causing hearts to appear. Finally, the room changes once more, this time into an ocean. Chests are present that, when interacted with, drop gold and diamonds. This time, fish spawn periodically on the ground, but do not add to the total on the hanging sign. After dialogue with Tobin, an automatic door opens to reveal the next room.

;Cave
Guests are led into an empty cavern lined with torches. Dayo and Tobin converse, with Tobin supposedly within the room with the guests and Dayo's voice appearing muffled behind a wall. After the dialogue completes, a worker opens the door to the next room.

;Mineshaft
Guests enter a room containing two minecarts, a minecart track, and 5 walls where they must mine blocks. If players mine fast enough, they discover a block of TNT, which, when mined, explodes to reveal a further mineshaft that contains [[zombie]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[skeleton]]s.  TNT eventually appears on every wall, breaking all blocks and allowing all guests to see further into the mineshaft. Minecart chests pass by every few seconds, containing a random number of either spider eyes or gunpowder. After a short time, a minecart cinematic plays, and a new mineshaft appears that contains [[Creeper|creepers]] in minecarts. Pigs and TNT in minecarts also appear, both able to be broken. After enough time has passed, creepers fall from above the screen on every side and blow up, marking an end to the room.

;Nether Portal
Guests then move to a room depicting a [[Lush Caves]] biome where they must use their orbs to combine lava and water to make obsidian and build a [[Nether portal]] within 4 minutes. As the portal becomes more completed, the music begins to ramp up in intensity, until the portal is finished by guests or they run out of time. In either case, the portal fully lights up, allowing passage into the next room.

;Crimson Forest
Guests walk into a room surrounded by mirrors and lit by blocky lights (very similar to [[Weeping Vines]]). After guests have spent a combined 6 minutes in this room and The Nether Portal, Dayo and Tobin explain the next room, The Nether.

;Nether
Passing through the Crimson Forest area, guests find themselves in a room depicting [[the Nether]]. They must complete a parkour course over lava to make it to the other side, with [[netherrack]] appearing periodically to make it simpler. Just before an animated wall of smoke are several [[Barrel|barrels]] containing snowballs ([[w:Dryer_ball|dryer balls]]) for guests to throw. The smoke then clears, revealing a scene of [[Piglin|piglins]] defending a [[Nether Fortress]]. Guests are meant to throw the snowballs at them, knocking them into lava. After some time, [[Ghast|Ghasts]] and [[Wither Skeleton|Wither Skeletons]] appear as well, with the former shooting fireballs at guests that can be hit back with snowballs, and the latter being able to be knocked into the lava. [[Pigstep]] plays in the background during this initial encounter. After defeating these mobs, the screen then pushes deeper into the fortress, and [[blaze]]s begin to appear. After some time, a giant blaze appears, which guests must work together to defeat. Around 30 seconds after the giant blaze appears, it will be defeated automatically, and the room completes, with a new Nether portal lighting up next to the guests to enter.

;Brewing
In the final room, guests place their orbs in slots surrounding a brewing stand. A cinematic plays, with Dayo and Tobin using the ingredients the guests gathered to brew a [[potion of Weakness]] (as a fog machine activates underneath/behind the brewing stand). Once the potions are finished, Dayo and Tobin throw them at the approaching zombie villagers, then throw the golden apples collected in Explore as well, curing all of the villagers. When the cinematic finishes, a total number of villagers saved (determined by the total number of items collected) appears, as well as several achievements with different gilds / naming (depending on how the guests performed). Guests are also invited to enter the trading post, marking the end of their journey.

;Trading Post
Just before exiting the Experience, guests walk through the Trading Post, or ''Minecraft Experience'' shop. The shop sells regular ''Minecraft'' as well as exclusive ''Minecraft Experience'' merchandise. Near the Trading Post is a VIP (Very Important Player) area, where guests who payed extra are able to get a few additional gifts.

== Trivia ==
* Officially, this was the last thing announced for the [[15 Days of Minecraft|15th anniversary]] event. However, the following day the [[Minecraft Animated Series|''Minecraft Animated Series'']] was announced, using similar branding.
* While Dallas is the first official stop of the ''Minecraft Experience'' world tour, a beta of the event was held in Montreal on June 17, 2024.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/supply-demand-group_aimerais-tu-vivre-un-avant-go%C3%BBt-de-la-future-activity-7206690958858465280-08Vi/ "Nous sommes à la recherche de volontaires pour tester une partie de cette expérience interactive."] – Supply & Demand Studio on LinkedIn, June 12, 2024</ref>
* Guests were originally supposed to go to [[the End]], but the experience was considered too long and had to be shortened.<ref name="Rays Works">{{ytl|t3VeWcl9S4g|7 Hidden Easter Eggs in NEW Minecraft Experience!|Rays Works|October 20, 2024}}</ref> 
* During the development of the experience, the producers mistakenly placed a [[silverfish]] in the underwater area, confusing it for an aquatic creature due to its name. It was later removed after [[Craig Leigh]] spotted the mistake.<ref name="Rays Works"/>
* The Minecraft Experience Cape's design was inspired by {{w|Two-Face}}, a villain appearing in {{Wikipedia|Batman}} comics.<ref name="Rays Works"/>
* Circonflex, the music agency responsible for the sound design of the experience, had to manipulate, remix, and re-harmonize the ''Minecraft'' [[soundtrack]] to suit the venue experience. To be able to do so, Mojang Studios provided them a 50 page internal document on the game's music.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.lbbonline.com/news/bringing-the-minecraft-experience-to-life-through-the-power-of-sound|title=Bringing the Minecraft Experience to Life Through the Power of Sound|website=lbbonline.com|date=January 15, 2025}}</ref>
