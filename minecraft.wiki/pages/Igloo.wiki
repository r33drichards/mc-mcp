An '''igloo''' is a [[structure]] sometimes generated in [[snowy taiga]]s, [[snowy plains]], or [[snowy slopes]] and built mainly of [[snow block]]s.

== Generation ==
Igloos generate in [[snowy taiga]]s, [[snowy plains]], and [[snowy slopes]].

{{Calculator|chunkbase|pois=I|zoom=0.25}}

== Structure ==
{{main|/Structure}}

An igloo is shaped like a small dwelling made of snow blocks. It has an entrance without a door and a [[carpet]]ed interior containing a [[bed]], [[furnace]], and [[crafting table]]. There are two windows made of ice blocks{{Only|JE|short=JE}}/packed ice{{Only|BE|short=BE}}<ref>{{Bug|MCPE-146636|3=Igloos spawn with packed ice}}</ref> and one [[redstone torch]] as a light source.

Half of all igloos have an oak [[trapdoor]] under the third carpet from the doorway, leading down a long [[ladder]] shaft to a basement. This passageway and the basement are built from [[stone bricks]], some of which are [[infested block]]s with [[silverfish]]. To the left from the ladder is a table made of stairs blocks, with a [[brewing stand]] containing one [[splash potion]] of [[weakness]] and a [[flower pot]] holding a [[cactus]]. Beside the table is a [[cauldron]] two-thirds full of water. To the right is a [[chest]] that contains a [[golden apple]]. Beyond the far wall, behind [[iron bars]] in two different cages, are a [[villager]] and a [[zombie villager]].

Igloos that generate without a basement have a snow block in place of the trapdoor. The villagers, the brewing stand, and the chest are absent in this case.

If an igloo with a basement forms partially above open-air, the shaft with the ladder still generates.

{{IN|java}}, the generated villager is always unemployed and is a plains biome type.<ref>{{bug|MC-150296|||WAI}}</ref> The villager cannot pathfind to the [[brewing stand]] or [[cauldron]] to take on a profession unless some of the blocks confining them are broken. The generated zombie villager always has the profession of cleric and becomes unemployed if cured.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, the villager is the snowy type with a random profession while the zombie villager is unemployed; although it can change its profession to cleric or leatherworker after being cured, due to the presence of the brewing stand and cauldron.

One may access the individual structures of an igloo by using [[structure block]]s to manually load them from the {{code|/data/minecraft/structures/igloo}} folder in [[version.jar]]. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter {{code|igloo/''structure name''}}, and press {{code|[LOAD]}}.  The individual structures are {{code|bottom|middle|top|delimiter=,}}.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*{{IN|Java}}, if a number of items in the igloo [[furnace]] are smelted, the light generated melts the igloo window, turning the [[ice]] into a [[water]] source block.<ref>{{bug|MC-100036|||WAI}}</ref> If the igloo has a basement, this can reveal the trapdoor leading to it.
*An igloo with a basement qualifies as a [[Village mechanics|village]] {{in|be}} due to having a [[villager]], a [[bed]], a [[brewing stand]], and a [[cauldron]], with the last 2 blocks counting as job sites. {{IN|je}}, however, the villager (or the zombie villager, if cured) must have a path to access either job site, which must be claimed in order for the igloo to register as a village. This means a [[raid]] can be triggered in an igloo.
*An igloo can sometimes generate on a cliff, on a mountain, over a cave, or on a floating island, causing its basement to be exposed.
*Igloos can generate deep down due to generation bugs, causing the basement ladder to lead to the [[void]], without generating a proper basement.
