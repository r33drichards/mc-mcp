A '''game mode''' dictates how a [[player]] may interact with a ''Minecraft'' [[world]].

== List of game modes ==
[[File:Gamemodes.gif|400px|thumb|right|Animation summarizing the game modes in ''Java Edition''.]]

The number of different game modes in ''Minecraft'' depends on the exact definition of a game mode. In practice, there are most commonly considered to be four. They are all controlled by the "gameType" variable, and all are accessible in-game via the {{cmd|gamemode}} command or the [[game mode switcher]].{{only|java}}

=== Survival ===
{{main|Survival}}
In this mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, [[craft]] [[items]] and [[tools]] and gain [[experience]] points. There is a [[health]], [[hunger]], and [[armor]] bar, an [[inventory]], and also an [[oxygen bar]] when [[water|underwater]], [[suffocating]],{{only|bedrock|short=1}} or in [[lava]].{{only|bedrock|short=1}} If a player runs out of hearts (health), the player dies and returns to the [[spawn point]]. Upon death, the player emits smoke, loses all experience and items, and leaves a [[death message]] explaining how the player died. Max reach is 5 blocks.

[[Demo Mode]], which may also be counted as a game mode, is Survival with the <code>--demo</code> attribute, which defines if the game is from a trial version or not.

=== Creative ===
{{main|Creative}}
The player has access to an infinite amount of almost all [[block]]s and [[item]]s available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable, unless they fall into the void,{{only|java}} and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can [[flying|fly]]. The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. [[spawn egg]]s. The player cannot see command blocks if they look through the Creative GUI - they need to spawn command blocks with the {{cmd|give}} or {{cmd|setblock}} commands. Alternatively, the [[Operator Items Tab|Operator Utilities]] Tab can be turned on via the Controls Tab in Options, containing command blocks.{{only|java}} Max reach is 6 blocks.

=== Adventure ===
{{main|Adventure}}
Players can interact with objects such as [[lever]]s and [[button]]s, and can interact with [[mob]]s. However, they can break [[blocks]] only with [[tool]]s having a {{cd|can_break}} data tag, and place blocks only if the block they are holding has a {{cd|can_place_on}} data tag, making this mode good for adventure maps. Max reach is 5 blocks.

=== Spectator ===
{{Main|Spectator}}
When in Spectator mode, players can clip through blocks and fly freely. The player can't interact with blocks, entities or their inventory.

Spectators are invisible to all players and mobs except for other spectators. When in third-person mode, a spectator looks like a transparent, floating head with no body. The player can use the scroll wheel to adjust the flying speed, unlike flying in Creative mode.

{{IN|java}}, the player can enter the perspective of other entities by left-clicking on them.

=== Other game modes ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}

==== Default ====
The "Default" game mode can be accessed by typing {{cmd|gamemode default}}, which sets the player's game mode to the world's default game mode. This corresponds the game mode set in the [[Create New World]] menu under "Default Game Mode".

==== Invalid game mode ====
Any invalid game mode functions similarly to [[Creative]], with the following differences:
* The [[health]] and [[hunger]] bars are visible, like in [[Survival]].
* The [[Inventory#Creative inventory|Creative inventory]] is still accessible, but blocks and items cannot be taken from it.

Invalid game modes are only accessible using [[Tutorials/Programs and editors|third-party software]].

== Changing game mode ==
The {{cmd|gamemode}} [[command]] can be used to switch between game modes. For example, {{cmd|gamemode creative}} puts the player into Creative mode.

{{IN|java}}, a player with operator [[permission]]s on a [[server]] or have enabled commands is able to [[Game mode switcher|cycle between game modes]] quickly by pressing {{keys|F3+F4}}, which then allows the player to cycle through the four available game modes available with {{cmd|gamemode}} by pressing {{key|F4}}. Alternatively, player may be able to switch to Spectator mode using {{keys|F4+N}}.

{{IN|bedrock}}, the game mode can also be changed by quitting the world, going to Edit World, tapping either Creative or Survival, and then returning to the game if cheats are enabled.

== Game states ==
In addition to game modes, there are several further states that worlds can be in with different rules and gameplay mechanics compared to a typical ''Minecraft'' game. They are separate from game modes, as they globally change behaviors for all players in the world and can (technically) be combined with any real game mode. Two of these special states exist in ''Minecraft'': [[Hardcore]] and [[Demo]] mode.

=== Hardcore ===
{{main|Hardcore}}
In this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the [[difficulty]] level is locked to "Hard", and when the player dies, they are unable to respawn and must either leave the [[world]] or permanently switch to [[Spectator]] mode, effectively preventing them from interacting with the world ever again.

Players cannot get Creative mode in a normal Hardcore mode game, unless "Allow Commands" option is enabled through [[Open to LAN]] feature and setting their game mode using {{cmd|gamemode}},{{only|JE|short=1}} or editing the [[level.dat]] with external programs and tools. Players who have died in the Hardcore mode game with different game modes (Creative, Adventure, Spectator; typically via usage of {{cmd|kill}} command or by [[void]] death), will be met the same fate of being unable to respawn in the world, just like in a normal Hardcore mode game.

The difficulty in a Hardcore mode game cannot be changed, even with the usage of {{cmd|difficulty}} command.{{note|Changing the difficulty using {{cmd|difficulty}} results in a successful message, but rechecking it afterward indicates that it is left unchanged from Hard difficulty.}}

In a [[multiplayer]] game, a player who dies gets put into [[Spectator]] mode, while all other players remain in Survival mode. When looking at a Hardcore singleplayer world, the game mode text is written "<span style="color:red;">Hardcore Mode!</span>" in red.

{{IN|BE}}, hardcore mode is a toggle, that locks the game mode to Survival and the game's difficulty to Hard. When looking at a Hardcore singleplayer world, the game mode is Survival-Hardcore.

=== Demo mode ===
{{main|Demo Mode}}
Demo Mode functionally serves to allow the [[player]]s to try out the game before deciding to buy ''Minecraft''. It allows players to play on a single world for a 100-minute (5 in-game days) period before the map is locked and required to be reset. The game is locked to [[Survival]] mode and cheats are off by default. While the demo version does not expire, it comes with certain restrictions, by others, as its sole purpose is to allow new players to try out ''Minecraft''.

Demo Mode is not technically a game mode as it cannot be enabled with the <code>/[[Commands/gamemode|gamemode]]</code> command.

== Summary ==
Below is a brief summary of the different available features in each game mode.

== Data values ==
In the <samp>[[level.dat]]</samp> file, Survival mode is <code>gametype=0</code>, Creative is <code>gametype=1</code>, Adventure is <code>gametype=2</code>, and Spectator is <code>gametype=3</code>.{{verify|is this still the case in Bedrock Edition?}} Hardcore can be toggled with <code>hardcore=1</code> (a normal world uses <code>hardcore=0</code> instead). This knowledge allows hacking to change game modes by editing the world's level.dat.
