'''Enchanting''' is the process of improving [[armor]], [[tool]]s, and [[weapon]]s. A [[glint]] animation appears on items to show that they are enchanted.

== Enchanting methods ==
[[File:Enchanted Diamond Sword.gif|thumb|The glint animation applied to an enchanted [[diamond sword]].]]
There are four ways to enchant an item in Survival mode:
* Using an [[Enchanting Table|enchanting table]], place an unenchanted item and lapis lazuli in their respective slots, and apply an enchantment at the cost of [[experience]].
* Using an [[anvil]], combine an [[enchanted book]] with an item. 
* Using an anvil, combine two of the same item with different existing enchantments into a single item that has the enchantments of both.
* A [[librarian villager]] may enchant books in exchange for emeralds, granting the player experience just like every [[Trading|trade]].

A player may also obtain items already enchanted:
* A villager may trade some enchanted items for [[emerald]]s.
* [[Fishing]] gives a chance of obtaining enchanted items.
* A [[zombie]], [[drowned]], [[husk]], [[piglin]], [[skeleton]], [[bogged]], [[stray]], and [[zombified piglin]], if it has an enchanted item and is killed by a [[player]], has an 8.5% chance to drop each item.
* Treasure chests in locations such as [[end cities]], [[ancient cities]], [[shipwreck]]s, [[mineshaft]]s, [[monster room]]s, [[desert pyramid]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, [[woodland mansion]]s, [[ocean ruins]], [[stronghold]]s, [[ruined portal]]s, [[Pillager Outpost|pillager outposts]], and [[bastion remnant]]s may contain enchanted items.
* To [[bartering|barter]] with piglins, give them gold, and they have a small chance to drop an enchanted [[book]] or [[iron boots]] with the [[Soul Speed]] enchantment (random level 1-3).
* {{IN|be}}, [[pillager]]s and [[vindicator]]s in [[raid]]s may drop enchanted items.

Server operators and players in [[singleplayer]] worlds with [[cheats]] enabled can also enchant [[item]]s using [[commands]] such as {{cmd|enchant}}. When enchanted with the {{cmd|give}} command, the maximum enchantment level is 255 on Java Edition. In [[Creative]] mode, items can be enchanted via an anvil and [[enchanted book]]s, with no [[experience]] points required. Enchanted books are available in the Creative mode inventory, with individual book displays for the highest level of each enchantment and other levels available via the "Search" tab.

The [[enchanted golden apple]], despite its name and glint, is not the enchanted form of any item and is completely different from the [[golden apple]].

=== Enchanting table ===
{{main|Enchanting table mechanics}}
[[File:Enchanting Table GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|Enchanting table interface.]]

An item can be enchanted by using an enchanting table and placing the item and 1–3 [[lapis lazuli]] in the input slots. Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs, written in [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]], do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied. On mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the lapis lazuli or hold the enchantment before release. The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a lapis lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 30 enchantment can give a pickaxe the "Efficiency IV" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of lapis lazuli required have no effect.

Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the lapis lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, but pay only 3 levels and 3 lapis lazuli.

The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are "maximum strength" — a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. On the other hand, multiple different enchantments can be given from one use of the enchanting table. For example, a level 30 enchantment applied to a pickaxe may yield both Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III. However, certain selected enchants never give any additional enchantment, regardless of which tool is enchanted, such as Efficiency IV and Knockback II.{{only|bedrock|short=1}}{{Verify}}

To increase the enchantment level, [[bookshelves]] can be placed next to the [[enchanting table]] while keeping one block of [[air]] between them. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a minimum of 15 bookshelves needs to be placed around the enchanting table. See the [[Enchantment Mechanics]] page for more detailed information on this.

Enchanting a [[book]] produces an enchanted book, which does nothing on its own, but effectively "saves" the enchantment for later application to another item with an [[anvil]].

Unlike with an anvil, using the enchanting table while on Creative still costs experience. However, if the [[player]] doesn't have enough experience, then experience reduces to zero and the enchantment still works, even when using the enchanting table while already at level zero.

==== Affecting offered enchantments ====
Enchanting any item at any enchantment level changes the player's enchantment seed, which changes the possible enchantments for every item at every enchantment level. Thus, if none of the available enchantments for a tool are desired, 1 lapis lazuli and 1 [[experience|level]] could be spent to enchant a book or a different [[tool]] to refresh the list.

The possible enchantments depend on the player's enchantment seed, the item type, and material, and the enchantment level (1–30). The following actions do '''not''' affect the possible enchantments:
* removing the item and putting it back in
* clicking on the item slot with a different item
* using a different item of the same type and material
* replacing or moving the table (but keeping the same number of bookshelves)
* using a different table with the same number of bookshelves, or
* replacing or rearranging the bookshelves without changing their total number.

Changing the enchantment levels offered by adding, removing, or blocking bookshelves alters the enchantments shown, but does not change possible enchantments; using another enchanting table with the previous bookshelf number still shows the previous enchantments. The enchantments for a particular enchantment level (with the same seed and item) do also differ depending on which row they appear in, but they are not "better" or "worse" based on the row despite the different resource costs.

=== Anvil combinations ===
{{main|Anvil mechanics}}

An anvil can be used to combine the enchantments of two [[item]]s, sacrificing one of them and repairing the other. The items must be compatible; they must either be the same type and material (such as two iron swords) or an item and an enchanted book with an applicable enchantment (such as a bow and an [[Infinity]] enchanted book).

Combining two enchanted items, books or one of each with the same enchantment at the same level produces an item or book with the next higher level of that enchantment up to the maximum allowed in Survival mode; for example, a book with [[Thorns]] I and [[Unbreaking]] II combined with a book with [[Unbreaking]] II produces a book with Thorns I and Unbreaking III.

To combine items, the player places the target item in the anvil's first slot and the sacrifice item in the second slot. If the combination is allowed, the resulting enchanted item appears in the anvil's output slot and an experience level cost, labeled "Enchantment Cost", appears below (green if the player has enough experience levels, red if they don't). To complete the enchantment, the player removes the enchanted item from the anvil's output slot, and their experience level is reduced accordingly.

The experience cost depends on the enchantments, with highly enchanted items costing more. If the target item is also being repaired, that costs more as well. The target item can also be renamed, at additional cost. There is also an accumulating surcharge for prior work done on anvils. In Survival mode, work that costs more than 39 levels of experience is refused, although it may still be possible to perform the same work in steps. For example, a damaged enchanted bow may be repaired on an anvil with an ordinary bow, and then another enchanted bow may be used to combine enchantments with the repaired bow.

=== Enchanted books ===
{{Main|Enchanted Book}}

Enchanted books can be made by enchanting a book in an [[enchanting table]] at the cost of [[experience]] points. They can also be found in the chests of several structures, purchased with [[emerald]]s from a librarian villager, or caught while fishing.

Enchanted books can be applied to tools, weapons, and armor, or combined with other enchanted books in an [[anvil]]. In this way, some enchantments that cannot normally be obtained on an item through use of the enchanting table can still be applied to those items, such as applying [[Thorns]] to boots.

Although enchanted books can have multiple enchantments of any type, only enchantments appropriate to a given item type are applied to that item when combined in an anvil. For example, an enchanted book may have both the Respiration and Power enchantments, but the Respiration enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a helmet. Likewise, the Power enchantment is lost if the book is applied to anything but a bow.

In Creative mode, enchanted books can be used to apply any enchantment to any item, such as a stick having [[Knockback]] II on Java Edition. However, mutually-exclusive enchantments, such as [[Infinity]] and [[Mending]], cannot be applied this way or even via {{cmd|enchant}} (though both enchantments function as normal when obtained on a bow through the {{cmd|give}} command).

The experience costs for ''using'' books are considerably less than for combining items with similar enchantments since the books themselves cost levels to create. However, it's still an extra cost, and enchanting items directly has a chance to get multiple enchantments. The advantage of books is that they can be stockpiled for use on an item of choice and allow for ''controlled'' combinations. For example, a Silk Touch book can be used on an [[axe]], [[pickaxe]], or [[shovel]], and the player can decide which item receives which enchantment.

==== Best Enchanting order ====
Use [https://iamcal.github.io/enchant-order/ Order Calculator] to minimize experience loss when merging two items.

== Disenchanting ==
The main way to disenchant items is via the [[grindstone]] or by repairing the items via the crafting grid. Using the grindstone removes all enchantments (except for [[curses]]) but gives some experience back based on the level of the enchantment(s) and their value.
If a [[block]] is placed, it loses all the enchantments it has.

Each enchantment in the table below includes attributes that are possible for the player to acquire legitimately in [[Survival]] mode. Other combinations are possible in [[Creative]] mode or with cheats, mods, or third-party software.

* '''Max Level:''' Maximum levels for enchantments vary, but the game can comprehend up to 32-bit integer values (&minus;2{{^|31}} to 2{{^|31}}&minus;1). Exceeding this value results in an overflow, and eventually resets itself to 0.
* '''Primary Items:''' The [[Item|items]] that can receive the enchantment legitimately in Survival mode by using an [[enchanting table]]. Items of any material can be enchanted (some more easily than others – see [[Enchantment mechanics#Step One - Applying modifiers to the enchantment level|Enchantment mechanics]]).
* '''Secondary Items:''' Items that, in [[Survival]] mode, cannot receive the enchantment from an enchanting table but can from an enchanted book with an anvil.
* '''Weight:''' Relative probability of the enchantment being offered.

== Summary of enchantments by item ==
{{See also|Tutorial:Best enchantments guide}}

Enchantments that have multiple levels are shown with their maximum level numbers. Mutually exclusive enchantments can be combined using [[commands]] (e.g., {{command|give @s bow[enchantments{{=}}{infinity:1,mending:1}]}}). Also, a player can exceed the maximum levels of enchantments (e.g., {{command|give @s netherite_sword[enchantments{{=}}{fire_aspect:10}]}}). However, if that number goes above <code>10</code> the translation string is exposed and it looks like this: 

{{Slot|[&bNetherite Sword]Netherite Sword[&7Sharpness enchantment.level.12/&7Looting III/&7Unbreaking VII/&7Mending//&214.5 Attack Damage/1.6 Attack Speed]}}<ref>{{bug|MC-248616||The strings for enchantment and effect levels above 10 are not translated|Invalid}}</ref>

The tables below summarize the enchantments that can be obtained on specific items {{in|BE}} and {{in|JE}} Survival mode (Any enchantment can be applied to any item in ''Java Edition'' Creative mode). Enchantments that can be applied to both hand slot items and armor slot items are listed in both tables.

*An enchanting table {{BlockSprite|Enchanting Table}} indicates the item can receive the enchantment from an [[enchanting table]].
*An anvil {{BlockSprite|Anvil}} indicates the item ''cannot'' receive the enchantment from an enchanting table, but can receive the enchantment by using an [[anvil]] to combine the item with an enchanted book or another enchanted item.
