** "[[Lilypad (song)|Lilypad]]"
** "[[O's Piano]]"

==== Vibrant Visuals ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals menu.png|thumb|Vibrant Visuals settings]]
* Made [[Vibrant Visuals]] the default graphics mode for supported devices.
* It is customizable and has two different built-in forms: "Favor Performance", and "Favor Visuals".
** Specific feature and visual settings can also be adjusted by expanding "Vibrant Visuals Options".
* Removed the ability to press {{cd|;}} to toggling graphics modes.
* Added the ability to data-drive some of the Vibrant Visuals settings per biome.
** Creators can provide multiple versions of atmospherics, color grading, lighting and water configurations.
*** Each configuration must have a unique {{cd|identifier}} and file name.
** The reserved JSON names for each group of settings (e.g., {{cd|lighting/global.json}}) will continue to function as before.
** Creators can utilize the {{cd|minecraft:atmosphere_identifier}}, {{cd|minecraft:color_grading_identifier}}, {{cd|minecraft:lighting_identifier}}, and {{cd|minecraft:water_identifier}} in Client Biome JSONs to connect particular rendering settings to a given biome.
** Note that certain parameters, such as tone mapping operators, caustics and wave simulation on/off cannot be customized per biome at this time.
** Parameters are spatially blended as players move between biomes.
* Added {{cd|henyey_greenstein_g}} settings to the fog json files.
** New section {{cd|henyey_greenstein_g}} allows specifying values for both {{cd|air}} and {{cd|water}}.
* Customized atmospherics, color grading, fog and lighting for the [[Overworld]], the [[Nether]], the [[End]], and a variety of biomes.
** Some issues exist with atmospherics in Nether and End dimensions.
* Shadows:
** [[Cloud]] shadows no longer pop in and out of view when looking on Android devices.
** [[Painting]]s now render with correct PBR properties, shadows and illumination.
** Changed shadows so that they cast further at [[sunrise]] and sunset. Prior to this change, shadows were clamped at a 30 degree angle relative to the horizon. This clamp has now been reduced to 10 degrees. This also improves an issue where specular highlights, light rays and volumetric fog were not properly occluded when the [[sun]] or [[moon]] was behind a mountain at a low angle.
* MERS changes:
** Added MERS texture support for Signs.
** Updated a variety of MERS textures.
*** Made [[glass]] more reflective.
*** Tweaked metallics on [[cauldron]]s and [[ancient debris]].
*** Tweaked emissives on [[eyeblossom]]s.
*** Added emissive to the [[End crystal]] to match item icon.
*** Added MERS textures for [[happy ghast]] and [[harness]]es.
*** Adjusted the [[glow lichen]] block emissive.
** Recalibrated all emissive values in MERS textures.
** Updated the appearance of metals for a variety of block textures.
** Increased emissive intensity and adjusted tone mapping parameters.
** Increased back-scattering of light underwater.
* Textures:
** Added new texture assets for a variety of [[armor trim]]s, particles, [[spawn egg]]s, water, and the [[dark oak boat]].
** Updated the textures of [[cave vines]], [[chorus flower]], [[pumpkin]], [[firefly bush]], a variety of other [[plant]]s, [[bee]], [[dolphin]], [[ghast]], pig [[saddle]] and [[strider]] textures.
* Added temperature grading settings to the color grading json files.
** Schemas must specify a format version of {{cd|1.21.90}} to access this new setting.
** New {{cd|temperature}} object added to {{cd|color_grading}}.
** {{cd|enabled}} set to {{cd|true}} or {{cd|false}} controls if temperature grading is enabled.
** {{cd|type}} set to either {{cd|white_balance}} or {{cd|color_temperature}} controls the type of grading applied.
*** {{cd|white_balance}} uses the temperature value to adjust the camera's white point. Lower temperature values will cause the scene to appear more blue.
*** {{cd|color_temperature}} is the inverse of the white balance operation. Lower temperature values will cause the scene to appear more red.
** {{cd|temperature}} sets the temperature in degrees Kelvin.
* Reduced the intensity and speed of the [[water]] caustics animation.
* Improved the Snell's window effect when looking up from underwater.
* [[End]] flashes:
** They are now visible again in the End.
** {{cd|the_end_light_flash}} sound effect now triggers when they happen.
* The local player's vehicle will now always be eligible for rendering, no matter the orientation of the model compared to the render bounding box.
* Particles rendered without the {{cd|minecraft:particle_appareance_lighting}} component are now renderered as expected.
* Updated shadow configurations for "Favors Performance" on all Xbox platforms.
* Updated volumetric configs for "Favors Performance" on Xbox One and Xbox One X.
* Temporarily reverted [[weather]]-related changes to [[sky]] color while some issues are sorted out.

'''[[Lead]]'''
* Using a firework rocket to boost while flying with an elytra now causes leashed mobs to unleash.
* Entities can now be leashed to a pre-existing leash knot by interacting with it.
* Players can retrieve entities tied to a leash knot by interacting with it.
* Shears can now be used to remove leash knots.
* Any leashable entity can now be leashed to any other leashable entity.
** To leash an entity to another entity, the player must:
*** Have the entity already leashed to themselves.
*** Sneak and interact with the target entity while holding the lead.
** Leashed entities can now be "stolen" by leashing them again, transferring ownership to the player.
** If re-leashing an entity would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance, the re-leashing cannot be done.
** To prevent erratic behavior when leashed to each other, llamas that are leashed no longer attempt to form caravans.
** A leashed entity cannot be leashed to itself.
** Baby mobs can only be leashed one way - to another entity; they cannot have other mobs leashed to them.
* When leashed to a happy ghast, [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[boat]]s, [[chest boat]]s, and [[sniffer]]s now adjust their position gradually over time, aligning smoothly with their leash holder when suspended mid-air.
* In all other cases, entities align to the direction they are being pulled and no longer behave erratically when suspended mid-air.
* Mid-air friction now applies to boats just like any other entity, meaning they can no longer orbit the player or behave excessively bouncily.
* The distance at which leads break has been increased to 12 blocks, except for the happy ghast, which has a break distance of 16 blocks.
* When the lead is pulled, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher.
* The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities.
* Boats and large leashable mobs that cannot fit in a boat (horses, donkeys, mules, camels, and sniffers) when leashed to a happy ghast are rendered with four leashes instead of one.
** In this configuration, the happy ghast also features a rope layer wrapping around it.
* Shears can now be used on leashed entities to unleash them, removing both incoming and outgoing leash connections.
* Players cannot cut other players' leashes.
* Dispensers can now use shears to unleash leashed entities.
*The recipe for leads has been updated to use string instead of a [[slimeball]].
{{crafting
|A1=String |B1=String
|A2=String |B2=String
|C3=String
|Output=Lead,2
|ignoreusage=1}}
*Attaching a leashed entity to another entity and using shears to cut leashes now take precedence over other interactions
**Example: Attempting to shear a leashed sheep will now un-leash it instead of shearing it
*Leash break distance is now calculated between the centers of the two entities' collision boxes, aligning with the rest of the leash physics calculations

'''[[Leather]]'''
* Can now be found in [[monster room]], [[ancient city]], [[desert temple]], [[jungle temple]] and [[stronghold]] altar chests in quantities 1-5.

'''[[Saddle]]'''
* Can be removed from mobs wearing them by {{ctrl|using}} [[shears]] on the mob.

|B2 = Iron Ingot
|C2 = Leather
|Output = Saddle
|ignoreusage = 1
}}
* No longer found in chests in [[monster room]]s, [[ancient cities]], [[desert temple]]s, [[jungle temple]]s and in [[stronghold]] altar chests.

'''[[Shears]]'''

** They cannot be removed if the mob has a rider.
** They cannot be removed if the player is crouching.
* Saddles cannot be removed from ravagers.
* Dispensers with shears cannot remove saddles, horse armor, harnesses and carpets equipped on mobs.

'''[[Spawn Egg]]'''
*Now the mooshroom spawn egg uses its own colors and no longer has two pixels that are the same as the cow spawn egg texture.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Projectile]]s'''
*Projectiles now have a tolerance margin that changes over time.
**Previously, all projectiles had a fixed 0.3 blocks tolerance margin added to the collision.
**Now, all projectiles start with no margin for the first two ticks of their flight.
**After that, the target margin will expand by 0.05 blocks per tick until it reaches the target margin of 0.3 blocks.
**This allows for more precise collision on targets close to the shooting player or entity, while still allowing for some collision leeway for targets further away.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Accessibility]]'''

'''Goals'''
*{{cd|minecraft:rideable}} component's {{cd|dismount_mode}} is now correctly applied when passengers are forced to dismount by the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.float}} goal.

'''[[Item]]s'''
*When using Custom Components v2, custom components can be assigned string, array, object, bool, or number:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"components": {  
    "example_namespace:example_component": "foo",    "example_namespace:example_component2": 4,    "example_namespace:example_component3": [        "hello",        "world"    ],    "example_namespace:example_component4": true,    "example_namespace:example_component5": {        "stuff": 4    },}

**UV locking will allow faces to have the same texture orientations as the default geometry state, regardless of how {{cd|minecraft:transformation}} component rotates the geometry.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Added {{cd|minecraft:random_offset}} component under the Upcoming Creator Features toggle. This allows for blocks to randomly offset like foliage does in the Vanilla game. Example:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
{  
    "format_version": "1.21.80",
    "minecraft:block": {
       "description": {
          "identifier": "test:test_block"
       },
       "components": {
          "minecraft:collision_box": {
             "origin": [-4.0, 4.0, -4.0],
             "size": [8, 8, 8]
          },
          "minecraft:random_offset": {
             "x": {
                // This is the range of possible values we can pick from
                "range": {
                   "min": -4,
                   "max": 4
                },
                // This is the equally spaced steps across the given range 
                // Provide 0 for all possible values in the range
                "steps": 16
             },
             "y": {
                "range": {
                   "min": -4,
                   "max": 4
                },
                "steps": 16
             },
             "z": {
                "range": {
                   "min": -4,
                   "max": 4
                },
                "steps": 16
             }
          }
       }
    }
</syntaxhighlight>
*Added {{cd|minecraft:movable}} component under the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle. This allows for blocks to configure how they should react when moved by a piston.
**{{cd|movement_type}} (Required): Specifies how the block should react when moved by a piston.
***{{cd|push_pull}}: Will allow a block to be pushed by a piston/sticky piston and pulled by a sticky piston (e.g. grass).
***{{cd|push}}: Will allow a block to be pushed by a piston/sticky piston (e.g. glazed terracotta).
***{{cd|immovable}}: Will not allow a block to be pushed or pulled by a piston/sticky piston (e.g. bedrock).
***{{cd|popped}}: Will pop a block when pushed by a piston/sticky piston (e.g. leaves).
**{{cd|sticky}} (Optional): Specifies how the block should handle adjacent blocks when moved by a piston.
***{{cd|none}}: Default. Will not add any additional behavior.
***{{cd|same}}: Will move adjacent blocks along with it when moved by a piston. It will not move different blocks with {{cd|"sticky": "same"}} (e.g. a honey block can move another honey block but not a slime block).
****NOTE: This field only works when used with:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"movement_type": "push_pull"
"format_version": "1.21.90",
"minecraft:movable": {
"movement_type": "push_pull",
"sticky": "same"
</syntaxhighlight>

'''[[Commands]]'''
*Added optional property {{cd|liquidSettings}} to {{cmd|place structure}} and {{cmd|place jigsaw}} commands. Defaults to {{cd|apply_waterlogging}}.

'''Components'''

'''[[Jigsaw]]'''
*Added optional property {{cd|liquid_settings}} to {{cd|minecraft:jigsaw}} JSON to allow control over handling liquids when placing structures. Defaults to {{cd|apply_waterlogging}}.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
*Custom Command registration will create an alias from the command name without the namespace.  
**If the name has already been claimed, then the alias will not be created and a content log warning will appear.
*Removed unused classes: {{cd|EntityIterator}}, {{cd|EntityTypeIterator}}, {{cd|FilterGroup}}, and {{cd|PlayerIterator}}.
*Updated class {{cd|Container}}:
**{{cd|reverseFind}} has been renamed to {{cd|findLast}}.  
**{{cd|contains}} now returns undefined if it fails to find the item.  
**{{cd|firstEmptySlot}} now returns undefined if it fails to find an empty slot. 
**{{cd|firstItem}} now returns undefined if it fails to find the item.  
**{{cd|find}} now returns undefined if it fails to find the item.  
**{{cd|reverseFindnow}} returns undefined if it fails to find the item.
*Updated error messaging when imports can't be found.
*Removed content warning when a custom component was registered without closures for custom components V2:
**This allows {{cd|data-only}} components to be registered in script and added to blocks and items that only contain parameters without functionality.

:{{cd|@minecraft/diagnostics}}
*Updated {{cd|SentryOptions}} properties:
**{{cd|dsn}}: Updated to allow the usage of {{cd|SecretString}}, allowing for secrets from {{cd|@minecraft/server-admin}} to be used to initialize Sentry.
**(new) {{cd|maxBreadcrumbs}}: The maximum number of breadcrumbs to store and report per error event to Sentry. Default is 20, supported values range from 0 (no breadcrumbs) to 100.
**(new) {{cd|sampleRate}}: A number between 0 and 1 that indicates the percentage of events that should be sent to Sentry. For example, a value of 0.5 means that 50% of events will be sent. Default is 1 (100% of events). 0 means no events will be sent.
**(new) {{cd|debug}}: When set to {{cd|true}}, additional content logging from the Sentry system will be enabled. Defaults to {{cd|false}}.

'''[[Experiment]]al'''
*The {{cmd|controlscheme}} command no longer requires the "Experimental Creator Camera" toggle.
**The {{cd|camera_relative_strafe}} control scheme remains experimental and still requires the toggle.
*Deprecated {{cd|align_target_and_camera_forward}}. Use {{cd|control_scheme}} to switch between control schemes instead.

'''World generation'''
*Namespaces can now be used in template pool element location and jigsaw block identifiers.
