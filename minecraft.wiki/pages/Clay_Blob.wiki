'''Clay blobs''' were a terrain feature that existed as a way for [[clay]] blocks to generate naturally. They were superseded by clay [[disk]]s.

== Generation ==
Clay blobs would generate extremely similarly to conventional [[ore (feature)|ore blob]]s (potentially even to the extent of being impacted by [[Java Edition distance effects|the same precision loss bugs]]), replacing [[sand]] blocks in beaches. They were common on desert coastlines as there was lots of sand to generate in. Elsewhere, they were quite uncommon. Clay blobs generated both above and below sea level.
