The '''wooded badlands''' or '''mesa plateau stone''' is a more humid variant of the [[badlands]] covered by [[oak trees]], [[grass blocks]], and [[Coarse Dirt|coarse dirt]].

== Description ==
Wooded badlands generate groves of trees at high [[altitude]]s, and therefore are the forest variant of the badlands. The uppermost layers of terrain consist of both [[grass block|grass blocks]] and [[coarse dirt]], with [[oak]] trees and [[grass]] growing on them, the former always appearing as small variants. [[Leaf Litter|Leaf litter]] and [[dead bushes]] commonly cover the ground under the trees. In wooded badlands, the grass and oak leaves take on a dull greenish-brown color darker than that of the [[savanna]] biome, giving it a droughted and weathered appearance. 

This variant is a rare source of wood in the otherwise barren badlands. The coarse dirt and grass layer on top begins generating above Y=97. Beneath, wooded badlands generate similar to regular badlands, with [[Red Sand|red sand]], [[Red Sandstone|red sandstone]], [[Stained Terracotta|stained terracotta]], [[Dead Bush|dead bushes]] and [[Cactus|cacti]] making up the landscape. Cacti might bloom with a single [[Cactus Flower|cactus flower]] on top. Additionally, [[Gold Ore|gold ore]] has a higher chance of generating, like in other badlands biomes, and mineshafts made of dark oak planks generate much more elevated and exposed than regular mineshafts. The [[Deep Dark|deep dark]] biome can spawn under this biome, although not as common as beneath [[mountains]] and plateaus.

Despite being more lush, wooded badlands still count as arid biomes and never experience [[Rain|rainfall]] unless divided by a [[river]], in which case rain appears in the river biome only.

[[Armadillo|Armadillos]] live in wooded badlands, and the warm variants of [[Animal|farm animals]] can spawn on top of the wooded plateaus. [[Wolf|Striped wolves]] exclusively spawn in here. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], wooded badlands have unique atmospherics, lighting, and color grading which appears dry and yellow with slightly more color than deserts, although they use default volumetric [[fog]]. 

Wooded badlands generate at higher [[humidity]] values compared to the default badlands, which means that they can often be found bordering [[jungle]]s. Wooded badlands also border [[Desert|deserts]], [[badlands]], [[Forest|forests]], and [[plains]], and they usually do not border [[Ocean|oceans]], but they can also generate by the ocean in areas with mountain peaks. They can also generate in [[Mountains|mountain]] peaks, where they can elevate up to Y=256 and rarely border [[Stony Peaks|stony peaks]]. Because of this, the wooded badlands is the highest biome with trees, that may peak at Y=263.

Due to their high humidity values, wooded badlands are almost guaranteed to have [[lush caves]] beneath them, although [[dripstone caves]] may generate instead when they're far inland. Due to their low erosion value, wooded badlands have a high chance to generate the [[Deep Dark|deep dark]] beneath them, but only when they are far inland.
