'''''Cave game tech test'''''&#8202;<ref name="video">{{ytl|F9t3FREAZ-k|Cave game tech test|([{{ytl|UMpv5kZ9-rE}} Archive]) Nizzotch|May 13, 2009}}</ref> or '''''Cave Game tech demo'''''<ref name="tech demo" /> is the earliest publicized unreleased version of what would become ''[[Minecraft]]''. It was made on May 13, 2009, between roughly 16:48<ref name="log">{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208190915/https://echelog.com/logs/browse/lwjgl/1242165600|title=lwjgl IRC logs|website=Echelog|date=May 13, 2009 (UTC+2)|quote=[18:48:38] <Notch_> I managed to force it to do as I want now. 72 fps, 288 chunk updates per second}}</ref> and 16:55 UTC.<ref name="8x8" /> This version was never released. A video of the game at this time was recorded by [[Notch]] from around 17:00 UTC and uploaded at 17:36 on May 13.<ref>[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]]: "''[19:00:52] <Notch_> hmm, I wonder if I could make a vid of this''" [...] "''[19:14:02] <Notch_> haha, the video ended up at 1.05 GB''" [...] "''[19:15:36] <Notch_> well, this is annoying. I guess I have to recapture. Google has a limit of 2 gb''" [...] "''[19:36:42] <Notch_> upload complete, processing video''" [...] "''[19:50:18] <Notch_> ok, the quality is still crap until the processing finishes, but: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9t3FREAZ-k''" </ref> It is the earliest known version of ''Minecraft'', or what was then known as ''Cave Game'', to have been recorded.

[[/Development|Development of the game]] started around May 10<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.minecraft.net/about.jsp|title=About the game|website=Minecraft|date=June  2009|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090615065538/http://www.minecraft.net/about.jsp}}</ref> or 11<ref name="11th">[https://archive.org/download/Rotab-Minecraft-IRC-logs Rotab's IRC logs] on Archive.org; #minecraft.20090525.log. May 25, 2009 (UTC+2). "''(10:40:09) <@Notch> heh, the game game tech test video is from the 13'th''"[...]"''(10:40:18) <@Notch> that was after two days of work, so I started the 11'th, probably''"</ref> to May 12 at the latest,<ref>[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]] "''[13:34:09] <Notch> i was trying to narrow down a performance issue last night.''"</ref> and continued up to May 13, 2009, adding the features that would be later seen in the [[#Videos|''Cave game tech test'' video]].

== Features ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Blank.png|32px]] [[Air]]'''
* Not listed as a block at this time.

'''[[File:Grass Block JE1.png|32px]] [[Grass block]]'''
* Made with the same graphics from Notch's game [[RubyDung]].
* Grass appears on fully lit tiles on the top 7 layers of the map. 
* Had the same texture on all sides of the block.

'''[[File:Stone JE1.png|32px]] [[Stone]]'''
* Made with the same graphics from Notch's game [[RubyDung]].
* Its texture at this time would later be repurposed for [[cobblestone]].

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Player]]'''
* Currently has no model.
* Has a height of 1.7 blocks.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Pass from the uppermost layer of the grass block to the penultimate layer of stone.

'''[[Chunk]]s'''
* Takes about 0.1 of a second to generate.<ref>[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]] "''[13:37:42] <Notch> rebuilding a chunk of these takes almost 100 ms, but that's everything, including tesselation, calculating lighting, and building the display list.''"</ref>
* The size of each chunk is 16×16 blocks.<ref>[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]] "''[13:37:08] <Notch> I've got chunks of blocks, 16x16x16 blocks. Each block can have a maximum of three quads, but that's worst case scenario''"</ref>
** Chunks are 16×16 blocks instead of 8×8 because 8×8 chunks decreased performance.<ref name="8x8">[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]]: "''[18:55:45] <Notch_> the chunk size is 16x16 now..''" [...] "''[18:56:47] <Notch_> 8x8 chunks are SLOWER''"</ref>
* Chunks are loaded in order of their proximity to the player.<ref>[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]]: "''[19:51:48] <Notch_> i'll update tiles chunks the player first, and force a full update upon game start''"</ref>
* The player spawns in a 256×64×256 tile map.
** The game takes 20 seconds to generate a 256×64×256 map.<ref>[[#lwjgl logs|LWJGL IRC Logs]]: "''[20:02:58] <Notch_> it takes like 20 seconds to grow a 256*256*64 map, though. :-\''"</ref>
* It was possible to fall out of the world, but it would not kill the player.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* WASD key use for movement.
* Space key for jumping.
* Moving the mouse moves the camera.
* Can’t break or place blocks.

'''[[Creative]] mode'''
* Does not exist.

'''[[HUD]]'''
* Nothing.

=== General ===
'''[[Light]]'''
* The lighting engine in [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] and [[pre-Classic]] was simple, with only 2 light levels, bright and dark. 
** "Sunlight" is emitted by the top edge of the map and hits any block that is under it, regardless of distance. It passes through transparent blocks to light blocks underneath. 
** Blocks that do not receive light are in a dim shadow that remains at the same level of brightness no matter how far they are from a light source. 
** Blocks which are darkened also have a layer of thick, black fog applied to them, appearing darker when looked at from further distances.{{verify|type=change|How is the light level 'dark' prior to Indev has the luminance value of?}} This caused weird visual glitches.
