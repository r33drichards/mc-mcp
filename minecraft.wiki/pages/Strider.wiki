A '''strider''' is a [[passive mob]] found in [[the Nether]]. It can walk on [[lava]] and be [[saddle]]d by the [[player]], being directed via a [[warped fungus on a stick]].

== Spawning ==
Striders can spawn in every [[Nether]] biome. Groups of 2 to 4 striders spawn on spaces of [[lava]] that have an [[air]] block above. {{IN|Java}}, striders are the only [[passive mob]] in the Nether, so spawning attempts are made every 400 [[game tick]]s. {{IN|Bedrock}}, striders share the animal population cap with [[hoglin]]s, and their spawn rate depends on the biome, being impacted by the ability of other mobs to spawn at a given coordinate.

For every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance for an additional [[baby]] strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. This behavior is limited to one strider.<ref>{{bug|MC-176028||Striders can spawn in stacks of three or more|Fixed}}</ref> A baby strider on the adult strider continues to grow, although it does not dismount the adult strider once it has grown up. 

Adult striders also have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning being [[riding|ridden]] by a [[zombified piglin]], forming a [[strider jockey]]. When this happens, the strider spawns with a [[saddle]] and the zombified piglin spawns wielding a [[warped fungus on a stick]] instead of a [[golden sword]] or [[golden spear|spear]]. The zombified piglin does not despawn naturally and does not count toward the mob cap. On [[Peaceful]] difficulty, the zombified piglin despawns immediately, leaving a saddled strider.<ref>{{bug|MC-232869||Adult striders can spawn with saddles in peaceful mode}}</ref>

If a strider spawns under [[lava]], it rises out of the [[lava]]. {{IN|Bedrock}}, baby striders spawn more commonly than adult striders do, including when spawned by a spawn egg.

}}
Striders wearing a saddle always drop the saddle upon death, regardless of if they spawn wearing it or if a player puts it on them. The saddle can be removed by using [[shears]] on the strider. 
When an adult strider is killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]], {{xp|1|3}} experience is dropped. Killing a baby strider yields no items or experience.

== Behavior ==
[[Lava]] does not damage striders, and they can walk on top of it without sinking.

Upon being harmed by another mob, striders attempt to flee for a few seconds while making "retreat" noises.

Striders are damaged by [[water]], [[rain]], and [[splash water bottle]]s, which deal damage by {{Hp|1}} per splash water bottle or half-second in water or rain. While in water, they slowly sink while taking damage. Striders still take damage from rain even if they are in lava. However, they are not harmed when standing in a filled [[cauldron]] as a baby. They also cannot be harmed by [[snowfall]] or [[snowball]]s. They take extra damage from freezing in [[powder snow]].

Unlike [[piglin]]s and [[hoglin]]s, striders can exist safely in the [[Overworld]], as long as they are kept away from water and rain. Striders outside of lava change to a dull purple color, change their expression to more of a frown, shiver, and their legs become slightly shorter. They also move slower when outside of lava.<ref>This behavior is controlled by the <code>[[Tags#blocks strider warm blocks|#strider_warm_blocks]]</code> block tag.</ref> 

If a strider has the {{EffectLink|Speed}} effect applied to it, it moves faster on both land and lava (though its land speed is still considerably slower). If a zombified piglin is riding a strider, the strider pursues the player if the zombified piglin is angered.

Due to a bug,<ref name=StriderLavaBug>{{bug|MC-197177}}</ref> striders that fall from a height take fall damage when landing in lava.{{only|je|short=1}}

A baby strider on an adult strider still grows into an adult. Apart from this, adult striders riding other adult striders do not spawn naturally. Baby striders not riding on an adult follow the closest adult strider.

=== Riding ===
{{Main|Riding}}
[[File:Strider riding.gif|thumb|right|A player riding a strider (click to see animation).]]
The player can ride on an adult strider using a [[saddle]]. 

Similar to how [[pig]]s are controlled using a [[carrot on a stick]], striders move forward automatically while their direction is influenced using a [[warped fungus on a stick]], at a speed of 4.24&nbsp;m/s{{only|je|short=1}} / 3.71&nbsp;m/s{{only|be|short=1}} if on a flat lava surface (such as the Nether [[lava sea]]) or 1.78&nbsp;m/s{{only|je|short=1}} / 1.64&nbsp;m/s{{only|be|short=1}} if on land. They walk especially slowly against the lava flow direction.

When a warped fungus on a stick is {{ctrl|used}}, the strider enters a boost for a random duration between 140 to 980 game ticks (7 to 49 seconds){{only|je|short=1}} / 320 game ticks (16 seconds){{only|be|short=1}}. Each boost takes 1 point of durability from the warped fungus on a stick. If the durability of the warped fungus on a stick reaches 0, it turns into a fishing rod.

While boosted, the strider gradually accelerates to its peak speed of 9.12&nbsp;m/s {{only|je|short=1}} / 7.98&nbsp;m/s{{only|be|short=1}} until halfway through the boost, and then decelerates to its default speed by the end of the boost. Specifically, the speed of the strider increases by <math>1+1.15\times \sin(\frac{t}{t_0}\pi)</math> times the original speed, where <math>t</math> is the time already passed since the start of the boost, and <math>t_0</math> is the total duration of the boost. No matter how many ticks the boost lasts, the average speed of the strider during a full boost cycle is roughly 7.34&nbsp;m/s {{only|je|short=1}} / 6.42&nbsp;m/s{{only|be|short=1}}.

Striders also follow players holding a [[warped fungus]] or a warped fungus on a stick. 

Unlike underwater [[boat]]s, players riding striders are not dismounted if the strider submerges in lava, and striders rise back up to the surface if this happens. However, players risk getting burned by the lava while submerged. {{IN|be}}, players can start riding a strider that is fully submerged in lava.

A strider ridden into flowing lava slowly rises to the top. Fall damage does not affect striders that have dropped onto flowing lava, unlike the bug<ref name=StriderLavaBug/> for lava source blocks. When ridden over land, striders automatically walk up any one block high slope. They also cross any 1-wide block gap or air space that is only one block higher - diagonally up - when ridden directly upward and not completely sideways to the slope.

To safely dismount from a strider, a player who does not have [[Fire Resistance]] may face a solid block within reach before dismounting to dismount onto that block,<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1256260637283569673|How are Striders feeling for everyone? Recent snapshot their walking logic was changed quite a lot and should be far, far more consistent.<br><br>Another change is that dismounting Striders when looking at a nearby solid block will dismount you onto that solid block, making it safer!|May 1, 2020}}</ref> instead of at the strider's location (which is usually in lava<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1256262349343936513|Him and many other players do seem to die from dismounting 😂|May 1, 2020}}</ref>).{{only|java|short=1}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-175573}}</ref>

A strider can still be equipped with a saddle while another mob is riding it.

=== Breeding ===
{{Main|Breeding}}
If striders are given [[warped fungus]], they breed to create baby striders, granting the player 1–7 [[experience]] orbs. The parent striders have a cooldown of about 5 minutes before they can breed again. All babies obtained through breeding take 20 minutes to grow up. The growth of baby striders can be accelerated using warped fungus; each use takes 10% off of the remaining time to grow up.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Strider fin.png|thumb|64px|Strider's fin]]
* Striders previously had a fin in their texture file. The fin was not visible in-game and was removed in 20w15a.
* If commands are used to saddle a baby strider, and the player rides the baby strider in lava, the player takes fire damage due to not being high enough to avoid the lava.
* Mojang added striders to the game as the solution to the community request for lava boats.<ref>

</ref> Prior to this, actual [[Obsidian Boat|lava boats]] made of [[obsidian]] were briefly added as an April Fools prank.
* At one point in the strider's development, before it was added to the game, a strider out of lava would retract its legs and start to take damage while bouncing around until it died, similar to how [[fish]] suffocate when out of water. This feature was discarded for being "too sad".<ref name="meet strider">{{Mcnet|meet-strider|Meet the Strider|July 7, 2020|Per Landin}}</ref>
* Striders were planned to have their own unique armor and saddle, but this was decided against.<ref name="MCIA kingbdogz">{{tweet|CagilMartin1|1554866644132175872|Fun fact: Striders we're originally going to have it's own armor and a unique saddle for it.

* Striders were initially going to have a long tongue with which they could eat things, similar to [[frog]]s. The different items would all have various effects, such as [[sword]]s hurting the strider, and [[TNT]] exploding.<ref name="MCIA kingbdogz"/>
* Part of the reason that striders drop string (from their bristles) was to answer the question of "how do [[piglin]]s make crossbows?".<ref name="meet strider"/> In ''[[Minecraft Legends: Return of the Piglins]]'', striders shed the strings that piglins used to make crossbows.<ref>{{w|Matt Forbeck}}, ''[[Minecraft Legends: Return of the Piglins]]'', Finding the Portal (chapter 8)</ref>
* The bobbing animation that the strider makes while walking was initially an accident. However, the developers thought it was "quirky and fun", so it was added as a feature.<ref name="meet strider"/>
