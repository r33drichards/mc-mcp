'''Coal ore''' is a [[mineral]] block that drops [[coal]] when mined.

'''Deepslate coal ore''' is a variant of coal ore that rarely generates at the top of the [[deepslate]] layer.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Coal ore itself can be obtained by mining it with any [[pickaxe]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. When mined without Silk Touch, it drops one [[coal]]. It is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1–2, 1–3, or 1–4 coal respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. It also drops {{xp|0|2}} when mined. Fortune does not affect the amount of experience dropped.

=== Natural generation ===
{{see also|Ore (feature)}}
Coal ore can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[ore blob]]s. It generates in two batches per chunk. The first batch attempts to generate 30 times per chunk in blobs of 0–37, evenly from levels 136 to 320. The second batch attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of 0–37, from levels 0 to 192, being most common at Y=96, and being less common toward either end of the range. Coal ore in this second batch is also less likely to be exposed to air: 50% of ore blocks that would generate exposed do not generate. {{IN|Bedrock}}, coal ore also has the third batches, which attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0–37, evenly from levels 128 to 256, within any type of [[mountains]] biomes.

Coal ore can replace [[stone]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], [[granite]], [[tuff]], and [[deepslate]]. Deepslate coal ore generates when replacing [[tuff]] or [[deepslate]], which is a rare occurrence due to the rarity of coal blobs below Y=8 where deepslate generates.

Coal ore is also found in small amounts alongside underground [[fossil]]s.
