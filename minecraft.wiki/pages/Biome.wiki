{{For|the definition of biomes in data packs|Biome definition}}
[[File:biome_preview.png|350px|thumb|''[[Minecraft]]'' contains different biomes that can be traveled to. Some examples, from left to right, are [[forest]], [[badlands]], [[deep ocean]], [[grove]], [[cherry grove]], and [[warped forest]].]]
A '''biome''' is a region in a world with distinct geographical features, [[plant]]s, [[mob]]s, temperatures, humidity levels, colors, and more. Biomes separate every generated world into different environments, such as forests, deserts, and oceans.

The biome of a location is determined during [[world generation]] rather than by the current environment, even if all blocks in a large area are altered to imitate the terrain of other biomes. {{IN|java}}, the {{cmd|fillbiome}} command can be used to change the biome in a selected area. Existing biomes can be located with the {{cmd|locate biome}} command.

== List of biomes ==
=== Biome types ===
{{IN|java}}, there are 65 different biome types: 54 for the [[Overworld]], 5 for [[the Nether]], and 5 for [[the End]], plus one used only for a [[superflat]] preset. {{IN|bedrock}}, there are 87 biome types: 54 for the Overworld, 5 for the Nether, 1 for the End, and 27 unused.

On this page, for convenience of description and reading, the biomes in Overworld are divided into 8 categories, which are not official.

=== Overworld ===

==== {{Anchor|Non-land_biomes}} Offshore biomes ====
These biomes are used for the generation of [[Ocean biomes|ocean]]s and mushroom fields. They are large, open biomes made entirely of water going up to Y=63, with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including [[gravel]], dirt, and sand. [[Squid]] and [[fish]] spawn frequently in the water, and [[dolphin]]s spawn in non-frozen oceans.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Ocean}}
The basic ocean biome. Like its colder variants, its floor is largely made up of gravel, covered with kelp and seagrass. However, small patches of dirt, sand and clay can also appear. [[Cod]] and [[salmon]]{{Only|BE|short=1}} can spawn here alongside [[dolphin]]s, [[squid]] and [[nautilus]]es. [[Drowned]] and rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es may also spawn here at night and during thunderstorms.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Deep ocean]]'''
|{{Anchor|Deep ocean}}
A variant of the [[ocean]] biome. In deep ocean biomes, the ocean can exceed 30 blocks in depth, making it twice as deep as the normal ocean. The ground is mainly covered with [[gravel]]. [[Ocean monument]]s generate in deep oceans, meaning [[guardian]]s, [[elder guardian]]s, [[prismarine]] and [[sponge]]s can spawn here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Deep Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Warm ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Warm ocean}}
A variant of the ocean biome, with light teal water at the surface. Like the lukewarm ocean, it has a floor made of [[sand]] and like all oceans, it is populated with [[seagrass]], but without [[kelp]]. [[Pufferfish]] and [[tropical fish]] spawn here alongside [[dolphin]]s, [[squid]] and [[nautilus]]es. [[Drowned]] and rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es may also spawn here at night and during thunderstorms. Unlike other ocean biomes, warm oceans allow for the generation of [[coral reef]]s and [[sea pickle]]s. It is the only ocean biome that does not have a ''deep'' equivalent, but the terrain in this biome can reach the same depth as deep oceans. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Warm Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Lukewarm ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Lukewarm ocean}}
A variant of the ocean biome, with light blue water at the surface. Its floor is made of [[sand]] with an occasional patch of dirt or [[clay]]. [[Kelp]] and [[seagrass]] generates here. Unlike the warm ocean biome, [[cod]] and [[salmon]]{{only|Bedrock|short=1}} can spawn here, together with [[pufferfish]]{{Only|JE|short=1}} and [[tropical fish]]. [[Dolphin]]s, [[squid]], and [[nautilus]]es may also spawn here and [[drowned]] and rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es can spawn at night or during thunderstorms. Coral reefs cannot generate here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Lukewarm Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Deep lukewarm ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Lukewarm deep ocean|Deep lukewarm ocean}}
Similar to the lukewarm ocean biome, but twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate [[ocean monument]]s, resulting in the spawning of guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Deep Lukewarm Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Cold ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Cold ocean}}
A variant of the ocean biome, with dark blue water at the surface. Like regular oceans and frozen oceans, its floor is made up of [[gravel]], though occasional patches of dirt can be found. [[Kelp]] and [[seagrass]] generates here. [[Salmon]], [[cod]] and [[nautilus]]es can spawn in cold ocean biomes alongside [[squid]] and [[dolphin]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}. [[Drowned]] and rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es may also spawn here at night and during thunderstorms.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Cold Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Deep cold ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Cold deep ocean|Deep cold ocean}}
Similar to the cold ocean biome, but twice as deep. Like other deep oceans, [[ocean monument]]s can generate here, which contain guardians, elder guardians, prismarine and sponges.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Deep Cold Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Frozen ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Frozen ocean|Ice ocean}}
A variant of the ocean biome with dark indigo water at the surface. Like the cold ocean, it has a [[gravel]] seabed and [[squid]] swimming about. However, the water's surface is frequently broken up by patches of [[ice]] and large [[Iceberg (feature)|icebergs]], consisting of [[packed ice]] and [[blue ice]], and occasionally topped with [[snow block]]s and [[snow]]{{Only|be|short=y}}. [[Stray]]s, [[drowned]], rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es, living [[nautilus]]es, [[polar bear]]s, and [[rabbit]]s{{Only|BE|short=1}} can spawn here, but [[dolphin]]s can't. [[Salmon]] and [[cod]]{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} may also spawn here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Frozen Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Deep frozen ocean]]'''
|{{anchor|Frozen deep ocean|Deep frozen ocean}}
Like the frozen ocean biome, the only [[fish]] that spawn here are [[salmon]] and [[cod]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, [[squid]] and [[nautilus]]es may also spawn here, and the floor consists of [[gravel]]. The frozen deep ocean biome also contains [[ocean monument]]s and a deeper floor than normal oceans, like other deep oceans. Frequent floating icebergs with [[blue ice]] generate here. [[Polar bear]]s, [[stray]]s, [[drowned]], rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es and [[rabbit]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} can also spawn here, but [[dolphin]]s can't.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Deep Frozen Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Mushroom fields]]'''
|{{anchor|Mushroom fields}}
This rare biome consists of a mostly flat island and has [[mycelium]] instead of [[Grass Block|grass]] as its surface. Mushroom fields are always adjacent to a deep ocean and are always isolated from other biomes, and they are typically a few hundred blocks wide. It is one of the few biomes where [[huge mushroom]]s can generate naturally, and where [[mushroom]]s can grow in full sunlight.

No mobs other than [[mooshroom]]s, [[bat]]s{{Only|JE|short=1}}, and [[glow squid]] spawn naturally in this biome, including the usual night-time hostile mobs. This also applies to caves, mineshafts and other dark structures, meaning exploring underground is safe. However, [[monster spawner]]s still spawn mobs, [[wandering trader]]s along with their [[trader llama|llama]]s can spawn, raids can still spawn [[illager]]s, but villages don't spawn here. the player can still [[breed]] animals and spawn mobs using [[spawn egg]]s and [[insomnia]] still attracts [[phantom]]s{{Only|Java|short=JE}}.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Mushroom Fields.png|frameless]]

==== Highland biomes ====
{{See also|Mountains}}
Highland biomes are biomes with a higher Y-level. Rugged terrain and snow-covered peaks appear above the snow line.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Jagged peaks]]'''
|{{anchor|Jagged peaks}}
One of the three biomes that generate in the peaks of a mountain. This biome is found in taller and more jagged and pointy peaks that often pass the [[cloud]]s and can peak at Y=256. It is covered by a single layer of [[snow block]]s with stone underneath often exposing ores such as [[Coal Ore|coal]], [[Iron Ore|iron]] and [[Emerald Ore|emerald]]. Just like the snowy slopes, stone cliffs can generate in some sides of the mountain. [[Goat]]s spawn in this biome. [[Polar bear]]s and [[rabbit]]s may also spawn here and [[stray]]s appear at night or during thunderstorms{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Jagged Peaks.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Frozen peaks]]'''
|{{anchor|Frozen peaks}}
The frozen peaks are covered by snow blocks and [[packed ice]] with occasional small blobs of [[ice]]. [[Goat]]s can spawn in this biome. [[Polar bear]]s and [[rabbit]]s may also spawn here and [[stray]]s appear at night or during thunderstorms{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}. This biome usually generates in smoother and less jagged mountains compared to the jagged peaks biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Frozen Peaks.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Stony peaks]]'''
|{{anchor|Stony peaks}}
The stony peaks are a warmer variation of peak biomes that generates in warmer regions to avoid temperature clashes. It is mainly covered by stone with large [[strip]]s of [[calcite]] and exposed ores. No passive mobs spawn here and there's no snow in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Stony Peaks.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Meadow]]'''
|{{anchor|Meadow}}
The meadow is an elevated grassy biome found in plateaus near mountain ranges. It is filled with patches of flowers and turquoise-green [[short grass]] and [[tall grass]]. All small flowers generate except [[blue orchid]]s, [[tulip]]s, [[lilies of the valley]] or [[wither rose]]s. Rarely, a lone [[oak]] or [[birch]] tree can generate and always has a [[bee nest]]. Both [[pillager outposts]] and [[Village|plains villages]] can generate in this biome. [[Sheep]], [[donkey]]s and [[rabbit]]s are the only passive mobs that spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Mountain Meadows.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Cherry grove]]'''
|{{anchor|Cherry grove}}
Cherry groves are grasslands with a lot of [[short grass]], [[tall grass]] and, instead of the traditional [[dandelion]] and [[poppy]] flowers, the ground is covered with [[pink petals]]. The main environmental feature of the cherry grove are [[cherry]] trees identified by their striking pink color. The cherry trees may generate densely enough to create a cover of leaves. [[Sheep]], [[pig]]s and [[rabbit]]s are the only passive mobs that spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Cherry Grove.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Grove]]'''
|{{anchor|Grove}}
The grove creates a forest of [[spruce]] trees beneath the mountain peaks when near a forested biome. It is quite reminiscent of the snowy taiga, but the surface is covered with [[snow block]]s and [[powder snow]] instead of grass blocks. [[Rabbit]]s, [[wolves]] and [[fox]]es can spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Grove.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Snowy slopes]]'''
|{{anchor|Snowy slopes}}
The snowy slopes generate beneath the mountain peaks and are covered with multiple layers of [[snow block]]s and [[powder snow]], with some sides also having stone cliffs. [[Goat]]s spawn in this biome alongside [[rabbit]]s and [[polar bear]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}. [[Stray]]s may also spawn here at night and during thunderstorms{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}. This is the only mountain biome where [[igloo]]s can generate, making it one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Snowy Slopes 1.18.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Windswept hills]]'''
|{{anchor|Mountains|Windswept hills}}
A highland biome with some steep hilltops and an occasional [[oak]] or [[spruce]] tree{{Only|je|short=y}}. The terrain is usually flat, but sometimes hilly and shattered. This is one of the few biomes where [[llama]]s can spawn naturally. Snowfall also occurs above certain heights, rarely creating snow layers on the top of the hills. Windswept hills are one of six biomes where [[emerald ore]] and [[infested stone]] can be found naturally. Cold [[animal]] variants may also spawn here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Mountains.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Windswept gravelly hills]]'''
|{{Anchor|Windswept gravelly hills}}
The windswept gravelly hills are mostly covered in [[gravel]] with occasional patches of grass and stone blocks. This is one of the few biomes where [[llama]]s can spawn naturally. Due to the low amount of grass, the population of [[spruce]] and [[oak]] trees in this biome is sparse. Cold [[animal]] variants may also spawn here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Gravelly Mountains.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Windswept forest]]'''
|{{Anchor|Wooded mountains|Windswept forest}}
This biome is found when windswept hills are located next to forested biomes. This is one of the few biomes where [[llama]]s can spawn naturally. It does not generate stone patches, so the floor is entirely covered by grass. There are more [[spruce]] and [[oak]] trees in this biome, forming small forests with a lower tree density than other forest biomes. Cold [[animal]] variants may also spawn here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Wooded Mountains.png|frameless]]
|}

==== Woodland biomes ====
Woodland biomes are rich in plants with a variety of [[tree]]s, [[flower]]s and [[grass]]es.

{| class="wikitable collapsible" data-description="Woodland biomes"
! width="15%" |Biome name

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Forest]]'''
|{{anchor|Forest}}
A common biome with many [[oak]] and [[birch]] trees and a fair amount of [[short grass]], [[mushroom]]s and [[flower]]s. The ground beneath the trees is covered with [[leaf litter]]. [[Wolves]] can spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Forest.png|frameless]]

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Flower forest]]'''
|{{Anchor|Flower forest}}
This forest variant has fewer trees but contains nearly every type of flower and tall plant in the game. [[Wolf|Wolves]] do not spawn in the flower forest, although [[rabbit]]s spawn occasionally. [[Bee nest]]s have a higher chance to generate in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Flower Forest.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Taiga]]'''
|{{Anchor|Taiga}}
A biome covered by a forest of [[spruce]] trees. [[Ferns]], large ferns and [[sweet berry]] bushes grow commonly on the forest floor. One can find packs of [[wolves]] here, along with small groups of [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s or cold [[animal]] variants. [[Village]]s may generate in this biome; the houses in these villages are built with spruce wood. [[Pillager outpost]]s may also generate in this biome. This is one of the few biomes where [[trail ruins]] can generate.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Taiga.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Old growth pine taiga]]'''
|{{Anchor|Giant tree taiga|Old growth pine taiga}}
A biome composed of [[spruce]] trees (despite it being called a pine taiga, since there is no pine in the game), much like the standard taiga biome. However, some trees are 2×2 thick and taller than normal, akin to large jungle trees. Mossy cobblestone boulders appear frequently, mushrooms are common, and [[podzol]] can be found on the forest floor. There are also patches of [[coarse dirt]] that do not grow grass, with some [[dead bush]]es. 

[[Wolves]], [[fox]]es and cold [[animal]] variants can spawn here, as they do in normal taiga biomes. [[Rabbit]]s may also spawn here{{Only|JE|short=1}}.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Giant Tree Taiga.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Old growth spruce taiga]]'''
|{{Anchor|Giant spruce taiga|Old growth spruce taiga}}
At first glance, this biome may look almost exactly the same as its pine tree counterpart. However, the most striking feature of this biome is its giant [[spruce]] trees, which are essentially a scaled-up version of regular spruce trees. One can easily differentiate this from an old growth pine taiga by observing how the leaves almost completely cover the tree trunks, whereas in pine ones, leaves tend to cover only the top. Like the old growth pine taiga, [[wolves]], [[fox]]es and cold [[animal]] variants spawn here, and [[trail ruins]] can also generate. [[Rabbit]]s may also spawn here{{Only|Java|short=JE}}.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Giant Spruce Taiga.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Snowy taiga]]'''
|{{anchor|Snowy taiga}}
Similar to the standard taiga, except much of the biome is covered in [[snow]]. [[Fern]]s and [[large fern]]s generate here commonly, however [[Sweet Berries|sweet berry]] bushes generate more rarely than in the regular taiga. 

[[Wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s and cold [[animal]] variants can spawn here. One may also find an [[igloo]] nestled between the trees, making it one of the three biomes where igloos naturally generate. [[Village]]s and [[pillager outpost]]s may also generate here{{Only|BE|short=1}}. Villages use the same architecture as taiga villages, but the villagers wear snowy biome outfits.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Snowy Taiga.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Birch forest]]'''
|{{Anchor|Birch forest}}
A forest that is solely made of [[birch]] trees. The grass is aqua in color, and unlike the regular forest, no wolves spawn in this biome. [[Wildflowers]] are very common in birch forests.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Birch Forest.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Old growth birch forest]]'''
|{{Anchor|Old growth birch forest}}
[[Birch]] trees grow much taller than usual in this uncommon variant of the birch forest biome. Whereas normal birch trees grow up to 7 blocks tall, these trees can grow up to 13 blocks in height. This makes deforestation a much more difficult task, although it provides the player with far more resources. 

This is one of the few biomes where [[trail ruins]] can generate.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Tall Birch Forest.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Dark forest]]'''
|{{Anchor|Dark forest}}
This biome is mainly composed of [[dark oak]] trees, which create a mostly closed roof of leaves. [[Oak]] trees, [[birch]] trees, and [[huge mushroom]]s can also be found occasionally, and the ground is covered with [[leaf litter]]. Trees in this forest are so densely packed that some areas are dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn, even during the day. On rare occasions, a [[woodland mansion]] may generate.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Dark Forest.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Pale garden]]''' 
|{{anchor|Pale garden}}
The pale garden is a rarer variation of the dark forest biome. It is, in fact, the rarest biome. The dark oak trees are replaced with [[pale oak]] trees, with lots of [[pale hanging moss]] hanging from the trees. Patches of [[pale moss block]]s and [[pale moss carpet]]s cover much of the ground, and patches of [[eyeblossom]]s dot the landscape. The sky, foliage, and water in this biome are gray and desaturated, and no [[music]] plays inside the biome.

Some of the pale oak trees may have a [[creaking heart]] hidden within them, which spawns a [[creaking]] at night. No passive mobs spawn in this biome. Trees in this forest are so densely packed that some areas are dark enough for hostile mobs to spawn, even during the day. On rare occasions, a [[woodland mansion]] may generate, making the pale garden one of only two biomes where it can be found.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Pale_Garden.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Jungle]]'''
|{{anchor|Jungle}}
A dense forested biome that includes many different plants and features. [[Jungle tree]]s and mega jungle trees are common, with the mega trees having 2x2 thick trunks and possibly growing up to 31 blocks in height. Fancy [[oak]] trees are also common, and [[jungle bush]]es often cover much of the forest floor. [[Fern]]s and [[large fern]]s are found commonly, and [[vines]] are found growing on most types of blocks, especially on jungle trees. Additionally, [[cocoa]] can also grow on the sides of jungle trees. [[Melon]]s can generate here in patches, similar to pumpkins, although they are much more common. Single shoots of [[bamboo]] can be found scattered throughout the biome. 

The foliage in the jungle is a bright, lush green color. [[Jungle pyramid]]s and [[trail ruins]] can generate, and [[ocelot]]s, [[parrot]]s, [[panda]]s and warm [[animal]] variants can spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Jungle.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Sparse jungle]]'''
|{{anchor|Sparce jungle}}
In contrast to the wild and overgrown vegetation of the jungle biome, the sparse jungle consists of [[jungle tree]]s, fancy [[oak]] trees, and [[jungle bush]]es that are spaced out and isolated, creating a much more open environment. The terrain of this biome is often flat, but there may be some small rises in elevation.

[[Parrot]]s, [[ocelot]]s, and [[panda]]s can still spawn in the sparse jungle{{Only|Bedrock}}. [[Wolves]] can also spawn in this biome along with warm [[animal]] variants.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Jungle Edge.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Bamboo jungle]]'''
|{{anchor|Bamboo jungle}}
In this biome, large areas of the landscape are covered with massive amounts of [[bamboo]]. Patches of [[podzol]] can be found underneath the densely packed bamboo. Additionally, mega [[jungle tree]]s, fancy [[oak]] trees, and [[jungle bush]]es can also generate here.

[[Panda]]s have a much higher chance to spawn here than the other jungle biomes, making this the best place to find them. [[Ocelot]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}, [[parrot]]s and warm [[animal]] variants are also able to spawn, and [[jungle pyramid]]s can generate here{{only|java|short=1}}.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Bamboo Jungle.png|frameless]]
|}

==== Wetland biomes ====
Wetland biomes are [[river]]s, [[swamp]]s and [[beach]]es. They have a large amount of water resources. Rivers separate other biomes; beaches generate as a transition between the [[ocean]] and land.

{| class="wikitable collapsible" data-description="wetland biomes"

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[River]]'''
|{{anchor|River}}
A biome that consists of water blocks that form an elongated, curving shape similar to a real river. Rivers cut through terrain or separate the main biomes. They attempt to join up with ocean biomes, but sometimes loop around to the same area of ocean. Rarely, they can have no connection to an ocean, instead forming a loop, or ending in a swamp or far inland. The grass has a dull aqua tone, much like the ocean, and trace amounts of [[oak]] trees, [[bush]]es, and [[firefly bush]]es tend to generate there as well. Rivers are also a reliable source of [[clay]]. These biomes are good for [[fishing]], but [[drowned]] can spawn at night and during thunderstorms. {{IN|bedrock}}, mobs other than [[salmon]], [[squid]] and drowned cannot spawn in this biome, even underground, except from a [[monster spawner]].
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:River.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Frozen river]]'''
|{{anchor|Frozen river}}
A river with a layer of [[ice]] covering its surface. It generates when a river goes through snowy biomes. [[Salmon]] spawn underwater while [[rabbit]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} and [[polar bear]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} spawn on the surface. At night and during thunderstorms, [[drowned]] can spawn below the ice with [[stray]]s{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} on the surface. {{IN|bedrock}}, no hostile mobs other then strays and [[skeleton]]s can spawn here, even underground, except from a [[monster spawner]].
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Frozen River.png|frameless]]

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Swamp]]'''
|{{anchor|Swamp}}
A biome characterized by a mix of flat areas around sea level, and shallow pools of green water with floating [[lily pad]]s. [[Clay]], [[sand]] and dirt are commonly found at the bottom of these pools. Trees are covered with [[vines]] and can be found growing out from the water. [[Mushroom]]s, [[firefly bush]]es, [[dead bush]]es, and [[sugar cane]]s are abundant, and [[blue orchid]]s grow exclusively here. [[Frog]]s of the temperate variant can spawn here as well. [[Swamp hut]]s with a black [[cat]] and a [[witch]] generate exclusively in swamps. [[Slime]]s also spawn naturally at night and during thunderstorms, most commonly on full moons. Some zombies may end up underwater, which can transform them into [[drowned]], and some skeletons are replaced by [[bogged]], making this an especially dangerous biome at night or during thunderstorms. Temperature varies within the biome, causing foliage and grass colors to vary. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[huge mushrooms]] also spawn in this biome. Visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Swamp.png|frameless]]

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Mangrove swamp]]'''
|{{anchor|Mangrove swamp}}
A biome characterized by a dense foliage, featuring plenty of [[mangrove]] trees of varying heights. The floor is mainly composed of [[mud]] blocks with occasional grass patches. The grass has the same color as in the normal swamp but leaves and [[vines]] have a unique light green tint and the water is teal rather than gray. Warm [[frog]]s often spawn in this biome. [[Slime]]s also spawn naturally at night and during thunderstorms, most commonly on full [[moon]]s. Some zombies may end up underwater, which can transform them into [[drowned]], and some skeletons are replaced by [[bogged]], making this an especially dangerous biome at night or thunderstorms. Visibility is also lower than other biomes when the player is underwater.

| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Mangrove_Swamp.png|frameless]]

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Beach]]'''
|{{anchor|Beach}}
Generated where oceans meet other biomes, beaches are primarily composed of [[sand]]. Beaches penetrate the landscape, removing the original blocks and placing in sand blocks. These are also useful for [[fishing]]. [[Buried treasure]] can be found under few blocks of sand, and an occasional [[shipwreck]] can also generate here. Passive mobs other than [[turtle]]s do not spawn on beaches. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Beach.png|frameless]]

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Snowy beach]]'''
|{{anchor|Snowy beach}}
Like a regular beach, one can find plenty of [[sand]] in this biome and [[buried treasure]] can be found underground in this snowy beach. However, sand is covered in a layer of [[snow]]. Snowy beaches are found when a snowy biome borders a frozen ocean biome. No passive mobs other than [[rabbit]]s{{only|bedrock|short=1}} spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Snowy Beach.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Stony shore]]'''
|{{anchor|Stony shore}}
This stone-covered biome generates at shores with low erosion values, usually close to [[mountain]]s. Depending on the height of the nearby land, stony shores may generate as medium slopes or huge cliffs, its tops tall enough to be covered by snow even when near warmer biomes.<ref name="MC-240697" /> No passive mobs spawn here. Buried treasure can generate here{{only|bedrock|short=y}}. [[Strip]]s of [[gravel]] can sometimes be found here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Stone Shore.png|frameless]]
|}

==== Flatland biomes ====
These biomes have a wide view on usually flat terrain, but can also generate on large hills or cliffs. [[Tree]]s spawn less here and water sources are plentiful. They also have a higher number of passive mob spawns.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Plains]]'''
|{{anchor|Plains}}
A flat and grassy biome with rolling hills and few [[oak]] trees. [[Village]]s are common. Cave openings, lava lakes and waterfalls are easily identifiable due to the flat unobstructed terrain. Passive mobs are easily found in plains biomes; this biome is also one of the few biomes where [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s spawn naturally, while hostile [[zombie horse]]s will spawn during the [[nighttime]]. [[Pillager outpost]]s may also be generated.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Plains.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Sunflower plains]]'''
|{{Anchor|Sunflower plains}}
A fairly uncommon variation of the plains, this biome is the only place where [[sunflower]]s naturally generate. {{IN|BE}}, [[village]]s and [[pillager outpost]]s may also generate here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Sunflower Plains.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Snowy plains]]'''
|{{anchor|Snowy plains}}
An expansive biome with a huge amount of [[snow]]. [[Sugar cane]] can generate in this biome, but can become uprooted when chunks load as the water sources freeze to ice. There are few [[spruce]] trees in this biome. No animal mobs other than [[rabbit]]s and [[polar bear]]s can spawn; however, it is one of the few biomes where [[stray]]s and [[zombie horse]]s appear. {{IN|Bedrock}}, this biome does not spawn monsters other than strays and [[skeleton]]s, but [[monster spawner]]s can still spawn monsters. This is one of the three biomes where [[igloo]]s naturally generate. [[Village]]s and [[pillager outpost]]s may also generate here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Snowy Plains.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Ice spikes]]'''
|{{Anchor|Ice spikes}}
A rare variation of the snowy plains biome that features large spikes and glaciers of [[packed ice]]. Usually, the spikes are 10 to 20 blocks tall, but some long, thin spikes can reach over 50 blocks in height. The floor in this biome is entirely covered in [[snow block]]s instead of grass, and [[ice patch]]es made of packed ice can generate on it. Like the regular snowy plains, no animal mobs other than [[rabbit]]s and [[polar bear]]s can spawn and [[stray]]s appear at night or during thunderstorms. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Ice Spikes.png|frameless]]

==== Arid-land biomes ====
In these biomes, it neither rains nor snows. The surface is covered with sparse vegetation.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Desert]]'''
|{{anchor|Desert}}
A barren biome consisting mostly of [[sand]] dunes, [[dead bush]]es, [[dry grass]], and [[cacti]]. [[Sandstone]] and sometimes [[fossil]]s are found underneath the sand. The only passive mobs that spawn naturally in deserts are gold/creamy [[rabbit]]s and [[camel]]s. At night and during thunderstorms, [[husk]]s, [[parched]], and [[camel husk]]s usually spawn in the place of normal zombies and skeletons. [[Sugar cane]] can be found if the desert is next to a river biome. Desert [[village]]s, [[desert well]]s and [[desert pyramid]]s are found exclusively in this biome. [[Pillager outpost]]s can also generate here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Desert.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Savanna]]'''
|{{Anchor|Savanna}}
A relatively flat and dry biome with a dull-brown grass color and [[acacia]] trees scattered around the biome, though [[oak]] trees may generate occasionally. Tall grass covers the landscape. [[Village]]s can generate in this biome, constructed of acacia wood, with some [[stained terracotta]]. [[Pillager outpost]]s can also generate here. [[Horse]]s, [[armadillo]]s and warm [[animal]] variants can naturally spawn here, while hostile [[zombie horse]]s will spawn during the [[nighttime]]. [[Llama]]s may also spawn here{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Savanna.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Savanna plateau]]'''
|{{Anchor|Savanna plateau}}
This biome generates when a normal savanna biome spawns at high altitudes and near mountains. It is mostly indistinguishable from the standard savanna, with the main differences being the fact that [[llama]]s and [[wolves]] can spawn, and villages and pillager outposts cannot generate.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Savanna Plateau.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Windswept Savanna]]'''
|{{Anchor|Shattered savanna|Windswept savanna}}
In contrast to the mostly flat and calm terrain of the savanna biome, this uncommon variant generates chaotic terrain, with gigantic mountains covered in [[coarse dirt]] and some patches of stone. The mountains in the windswept savanna are extremely steep, sometimes jutting out at 90-degree angles, making it almost impossible to climb. On top of that, they can reach heights comparable to the mountain peak biomes, sometimes rising above the [[cloud]]s. Massive waterfalls and lavafalls are quite common, and ocean-like lakes can also generate. 
Unlike the regular savanna, villages and pillager outposts do not generate in this biome. [[Horse]]s, [[armadillo]]s and warm [[animal]] variants can still spawn in the windswept savanna, as well as hostile [[zombie horse]]s during the nighttime. [[Llama]]s may also spawn here{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}}. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Shattered Savanna.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Badlands]]'''
|{{Anchor|Badlands}}
An uncommon biome where large mounds of [[terracotta]] and stained terracotta generate. [[Red sand]] also generates here instead of regular sand, with occasional [[cacti]], [[dead bush]]es, and [[dry grass]]. This biome is usually found alongside desert biomes and it can generate in mountainous terrain. [[Armadillos]] are the only mobs that can be found here. [[Mineshaft]]s generate at a higher altitude than normal - occasionally a player may come across a mineshaft jutting out of the badlands. [[Gold ore]] also occurs more frequently, because additional veins can generate within badlands up to Y=256. The composition of this biome is useful when other sources of terracotta and gold are scarce.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Badlands.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Wooded badlands]]'''
|{{Anchor|Wooded badlands plateau|Wooded badlands}}
The wooded badlands has layers of [[coarse dirt]] and [[grass blocks]], and forests of [[oak]] trees with [[leaf litter]] that generate at higher altitudes in humid areas. The lower parts don't generate the oak forests, exposing [[terracotta]] and [[red sand]] to the sky. The color of the grass and leaves is a dull green-brown hue, giving it a dried and dead appearance. These trees are a rare source of wood when living in the otherwise barren badlands. [[Armadillos]] can spawn here during the day, and [[wolves]] and warm [[animal]] variants can spawn on the wooded plateaus.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Wooded Badlands Plateau.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Eroded badlands]]'''
|{{Anchor|Eroded badlands}}
This rare variant generates unique terrain features that are similar to the [[Wikipedia:Hoodoo (geology)|structures in Utah's Bryce Canyon]]. Tall and narrow spires of colorful [[terracotta]] rise out of the floor of the canyon, which like all other badlands variants, is covered in red sand. [[Armadillo]]s are the only passive mobs that can be found here.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Eroded Badlands.png|frameless]]

==== Cave biomes ====
These biomes generate inside [[cave]]s in the Overworld. They're mostly found underground but can sometimes leak out of cave entrances.

| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Deep dark]]'''
|{{anchor|Deep dark}}
A dimly lit cave biome that generates deep underground mostly within the [[deepslate]] layer. It is largely [[sculk]] blocks 1 block thick upon all surfaces, with frequent [[sculk sensor]]s and occasional [[sculk shrieker]]s, the latter of which can directly summon a [[warden]]. Large structures known as [[ancient cities]] can generate here, containing [[chest]]s with unique loot. No mobs aside from [[warden]]s spawn here, except from a [[monster spawner]].
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Deep Dark.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Dripstone caves]]'''
|{{anchor|Dripstone caves}}
These are caves filled with [[dripstone block]]s and [[pointed dripstone]] both hanging as stalactites and growing from the ground as stalagmites and small [[water]] wells of 1×1 in the ground. Large [[dripstone cluster]]s structures generate occasionally inside these caves. [[Copper ore]] blobs found in this biome are much bigger compared to other biomes. [[Drowned]] and rarely [[zombie nautilus]]es can spawn in aquifers.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Dripstone Caves.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Lush caves]]'''
|{{anchor|Lush caves}}
Lush caves are often found underground below [[azalea tree]]s. These caves are covered by [[moss block]]s, [[moss carpet]]s, [[short grass]] and [[azalea]] bushes on the floors. On the ceiling, [[vine]]s and cave vines with [[glow berries]] grow down and light up the caves, and [[spore blossom]]s grow from the ceiling and spore [[particle]]s. There are also shallow lakes with [[clay]] where [[dripleaf]] plants grow out of them and [[axolotl]]s spawn, making this the only biome where they can spawn. [[Tropical fish]] can also spawn inside the aquifers in a lush cave.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Lush Caves.png|frameless]]

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[The Void]]'''{{only|java}} 
|{{anchor|Void|The Void}}
Can be accessed only through [[Single Biome]] world selection or The Void [[Superflat#Presets|superflat preset]]. In a single biome world, the landscape consists of stone, as well as water and bedrock depending on the generator type. In The Void superflat preset, the world is completely empty except for a single structure: a 33×33 stone platform with a single block of cobblestone in the center. No mobs (passive or hostile) aside from [[phantom]]s and [[Patrol|pillager patrols]] can spawn without [[spawn egg]]s, [[monster spawner]]s or [[commands]]. It does not rain in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:The Void.png|frameless]]
|}

=== The Nether ===
[[The Nether]] is considered a different [[dimension]]. All biomes in this dimension are hot and dry, and it is not possible to place [[water]]; [[ice]] can still be placed, though it does not turn into water upon melting. Lava oceans are generated as a [[feature]] and are therefore not considered a separate biome.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Nether wastes]]'''
|{{anchor|Nether|The Nether|Hell|Nether wastes}}
The Nether wastes is the most common biome in the Nether. The terrain mainly consists of [[netherrack]], with [[glowstone]] clusters growing and lava leaking from the ceiling and [[gravel]] and [[soul sand]] lining its shores. Most of the Nether’s mobs can spawn here, including [[ghast]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[strider]]s, [[piglin]]s, and the occasional [[enderman]].
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Nether.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Soul sand valley]]'''
|{{anchor|Soul sand valley}}
The soul sand valley mainly consists of [[soul sand]], basalt and [[soul soil]]. Notable features of the biome are exposed [[Nether fossil]]s in various shapes and sizes, large amounts of [[lava]], blue fog, large spires made of [[basalt]], [[soul fire]], and the occasional [[Nether fortress]] or [[bastion remnant]]. [[Ghast]]s and [[skeleton]]s are common in this biome while [[Enderman|endermen]] are rare. [[Strider]]s can spawn here as well. This is the only place to find [[dried ghast]]s naturally.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Soul Sand Valley.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Crimson forest]]'''
|{{anchor|Crimson forest}}
The crimson forest consists of many [[Huge crimson fungus|huge crimson fungi]], which act as the "trees" of this biome. The huge fungi often generate with [[weeping vines]] hanging from them, and [[shroomlight]]s which light up the landscape. The floor is mostly covered with crimson [[nylium]], with occasional patches of bare [[netherrack]] or [[Nether wart block]]s. [[Crimson roots]], [[crimson fungus]], and occasionally warped fungus grow on the ground. Small patches of Nether wart blocks and weeping vines can also be found growing on the ceiling. 

[[Hoglin]]s, [[piglin]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, and [[strider]]s can spawn in this biome. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Crimson Forest.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Warped forest]]'''
|{{anchor|Warped forest}}
The warped forest consists of many [[Huge warped fungus|huge warped fungi]], which act as the "trees" of this biome. The huge fungi often generate with [[shroomlight]]s, which light up the landscape. [[Twisting vines]] grow throughout the biome in patches. The floor is mostly covered with warped [[nylium]], with occasional patches of bare [[netherrack]] or [[warped wart block]]s. [[Warped roots]], [[warped fungus]], [[Nether sprouts]], and occasionally crimson fungus grow on the ground.

[[Endermen]] and [[strider]]s are the only mobs that spawn in this biome. The biome emits out a magenta-purple fog upon entry. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Warped Forest.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Basalt deltas]]'''
|{{anchor|Basalt deltas}}
A gray biome, the basalt deltas are said to be the remnant of ancient volcanic eruptions.{{citation needed}} The ground consists of [[basalt]] and [[blackstone]] blocks, with small patches of [[netherrack]] and pools of [[lava]]. The shape of the terrain is chaotic and uneven, making it somewhat difficult to traverse and build on. Unlike the other biomes in the Nether, [[bastion remnant]]s do not generate in basalt deltas. When this biome borders a lava ocean, clusters of basalt form near the coast. Fog is colored light-gray and particles of dust can be seen falling from the ceiling upon entry. 

Magma cubes have a high spawn rate in this biome, making the basalt deltas the best place to [[Tutorial:Magma Cube farming|farm magma cream]]. This biome also contains a much higher abundance of blackstone compared to other Nether biomes. [[Ghast]]s and [[strider]]s can spawn in this biome as well. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:BasaltDeltas.png|frameless]]
|}

=== The End ===
[[The End]] is considered a different dimension. The terrain consists of [[End Stone|end stone]] islands of varying sizes, floating in the [[void]]. They use five different biomes {{In|je}}, or all use [[The End (biome)|the End]] {{In|be}}, with no terrain differences.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[The End (biome)|The End]]'''
|{{anchor|The End|End}}
This biome is used to generate the circle of radius 1000 centered at the 0,0 coordinates in [[the End]]. The End central island is generated at the center of this circle, and it's surrounded by a complete vacuum all the way to the edge of the biome. Most of the End features are exclusive to that island, including the [[ender dragon]], the [[End spike|obsidian pillars]], the [[End crystal]]s, the 5×5 spawn platform, the exit portal and the 20 central [[End gateway]]s. Large amounts of [[endermen]] spawn in this biome. It does not rain or snow in this biome unlike the other low-temperature biomes. The outer islands in the End can be accessed using [[End gateway]]s after the ender dragon has been defeated. {{IN|Bedrock}}, this biome is instead the biggest, as it is used to generate the whole dimension. 

If the biome is used for a [[superflat]] world, the sky appears nearly black and an ender dragon spawns at the 0,0 coordinates in the Overworld. Only endermen spawn at night.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:The End.png|frameless]]

| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Small End islands]]'''{{Only|Java|short=JE}}
|{{anchor|Small End islands}}

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[End midlands]]'''{{Only|Java|short=JE}}
|{{anchor|End midlands}}
Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the gradual slope from the hilltops of each island down to the cliffs around the edge. [[End cities]] generate here, but chorus trees do not. Large amounts of [[Enderman|endermen]] spawn in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:End Midlands.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[End highlands]]'''{{Only|Java|short=JE}}
|{{anchor|End highlands}}
Generates as part of the outer islands of the End. This biome represents the hilltops of each island, and is the only biome in the End where both [[chorus tree]]s and [[End cities]] generate. Large amounts of [[Enderman|endermen]] spawn in this biome. 
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:End Highlands.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[End barrens]]'''{{Only|Java|short=JE}}

=== Unused biomes ===
{{Removed feature|section=y|edition=je}}{{Unobtainable|section=y|edition=be}}{{main|Biome/Before 1.18}}
{{see also|Bedrock Edition unused features}}

These biomes have been completely removed from the game {{in|java}}. {{IN|be}}, they still exist in the code, but do not generate and can only be found in old worlds. Most biomes were removed from the generator because the terrain was the only difference with their regular biome variant.

|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Legacy frozen ocean]]'''
| Similar to the [[frozen ocean]] biome, but without icebergs, it was completely flat. Because they were a frozen ocean variant, they could spawn [[polar bear]]s and [[stray]]s, but not [[dolphin]]s. Unlike the regular frozen ocean, polar bears, [[drowned]], [[squid]], [[salmon]], [[cod]], [[rabbit]]s, [[Skeleton|skeletons]] and [[stray]]s were the only mobs that spawn here. Kelp also generated here. 
This biome doesn't generate naturally from [[Pocket Edition Alpha 0.9.0]] onward. When [[Bedrock Edition 1.4.0]] introduced the new frozen ocean, this biome was not removed or replaced by the new frozen ocean, although the id name changed from <code>frozen_ocean</code> to <code>legacy_frozen_ocean</code>.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Legacy Frozen Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Desert lakes]]'''
| In this biome, patches of water were more common, and the terrain was slightly more rough. Although desert wells could be found, desert pyramids, villages and outposts did not generate in this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Desert Lakes.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Mountain edge]]'''
| Similar to the [[sparse jungle]] biome, the mountain edge used to generate exclusively at the edge of windswept hills biomes in order to smooth the transition between biomes. This biome had lots of trees, similar to windswept forests. While the terrain was lower and gentler in nature, some areas might reach high enough to be covered by snow. 
This biome doesn't generate naturally from [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]] and [[Java Edition 1.7.2]] onward.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Mountain Edge.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Deep warm ocean]]'''
| Similar to the [[warm ocean]] biome, but without coral reefs or sea pickles, and twice as deep. Because they were a deep ocean variant, they could generate ocean monuments.
The deep warm ocean did not naturally generate in any non-snapshot or non-beta version.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Deep Warm Ocean.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''Hills'''
| Hills biomes were generated as small spots scattered throughout certain biomes. This included: 

* {{BiomeLink|Wooded Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Taiga Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Jungle Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Desert Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Birch Forest Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Giant Tree Taiga Hills}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Mountains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Bamboo Jungle Hills}}

Most hills were gentle rolling slopes on which the usual biome terrain generated, with some sharper cliffs here and there. Snowy mountains had a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%).

[[Swamp hills]] and [[dark forest hills]] generated as 'modified' biomes instead of hills biomes, making them slightly rarer but also bigger in size.

[[Tall birch hills]] generated as 'modified hills' biomes, which made them even rarer than modified biomes. Tall birch hills had much more mountainous terrain than most hills biomes.
| style="text-align:center;" | [[File:Giant Tree Taiga Hills.png|frameless]]<br>[[File:Desert Hills.png|frameless]]<br>[[File:Jungle Hills.png|frameless]]<br>[[File:Snowy Mountains.png|frameless]]<br>[[File:Tall Birch Hills.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Giant spruce taiga hills]]'''
|Giant spruce taiga hills were a special case. {{IN|java}}, the game code sets the values <code>setBaseHeight</code> and <code>setHeightVariation</code> to define a "hilly" biome, but used the same values as for its non-hill variant ({{Abbr|giant spruce taiga|now known as old growth spruce taiga}}), meaning there was absolutely no terrain difference between the two biomes.

{{IN|bedrock}}, this biome did generate as a much hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, even more mountainous than regular hills biomes. However, the giant spruce taiga hills used the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills (with leaves only at the top), making this biome very similar to the giant tree taiga hills.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Giant Spruce Taiga Hills.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Badlands plateau]]'''
| Badlands plateaus generated as actual biomes<!--standalone, with regular badlands as its hills biome--> in badlands biomes, and were flattened at the top, much like real-life plateaus. They came to rest at an elevation of about 20 to 30 blocks above sea level. One may discover the entrance to a mineshaft within the tall slopes of a badlands plateau.
With the new terrain generation in [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], the regular [[badlands]] biome also featured these plateaus and this biome became redundant.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Badlands Plateau.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Shattered savanna plateau]]'''
| The terrain of the shattered savanna plateau biome was much less tame than its normal counterpart. It featured incredibly large and steep mountains that jut out of the terrain, similar to the {{Abbr|shattered savanna|now known as windswept savanna}} biome, albeit slightly smaller and gentler in comparison.
{{IN|BE}}, the grass and foliage color was lush green (the same color as in mushroom fields), making it easily distinguishable from the regular shattered savanna.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Shattered Savanna Plateau.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Modified wooded badlands plateau]]'''
|This biome featured grass and oak trees on top of plateaus, much like its counterpart. However, the plateaus that generated here were generally smaller, allowing far less foliage to be generated. The terrain was more erratic, and could be compared to that of the similar modified badlands plateau biome, having an old and eroded appearance. Eroded badlands generated instead of desert alongside this biome.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Modified Wooded Badlands Plateau.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Modified Badlands Plateau|Modified badlands plateau]]'''
| Compared to the average badlands plateau, the modified badlands plateau featured more variable terrain and smaller plateaus, as if a larger plateau was weathered down over time. It was the second-rarest biome in the game, after the modified jungle edge.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Modified Badlands Plateau.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" |'''[[Mushroom field shore]]'''
|Mushroom field shores represented the transition between [[mushroom fields]] and the ocean, forming long strips between the biomes as a "beach", hence the name. However, it did not generate if the ocean biome was a deep ocean. This biome also generated when a river met a mushroom fields biome, similar to what frozen rivers did in snowy plains. The terrain of this biome was much more flat and shallow than the main mushroom fields biome, though it contained many of the same features, such as a mycelium surface layer, huge mushrooms and lack of hostile mobs, but shipwrecks and buried treasures could generate here{{Only|BE}}.
Because the terrain was the only difference with the regular mushroom fields biome, this biome became redundant after [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]].
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Mushroom Field Shore.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Gravelly Mountains+|Gravelly mountains+]]'''
| The gravelly mountains+ had exactly the same terrain and features as the regular {{Abbr|gravelly mountains|now known as windswept gravelly hills}}.
{{IN|BE}}, the regular gravelly mountains did not have any trees, but this biome did, making it slightly different. Because almost no grass blocks were generated between the gravel, trees did rarely generate.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Gravelly_Mountains_Plus.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Modified Jungle|Modified jungle]]'''
|The modified jungle featured very mountainuous terrain, with many cliffs and overhangs.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Modified_Jungle.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Modified Jungle Edge|Modified jungle edge]]'''
|The very rare modified jungle edge only generated when a rare swamp hills biome bordered a jungle. Like the regular modified jungle, this biome had much more mountainous terrain, but it was very small in size.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Modified_Jungle_Edge.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Taiga Mountains|Taiga mountains]]'''
| Like the snowy taiga mountains, this biome featured very mountainous terrain, sometimes passing snowfall height. The taiga mountains were very similar to the windswept forest, but with a higher density of trees and slightly lower elevation.
| style="text-align:center;" |[[File:Taiga_Mountains.png|frameless]]
|-
| style="text-align:center;" | '''[[Snowy Taiga Mountains|Snowy taiga mountains]]'''
| The very rare snowy taiga mountains featured even more mountainous terrain than the snowy taiga hills, although not as much as the windswept hills.

== Tint ==
All biomes use a set of [[colors]] for various environmental aspects such as the [[sky]], [[water]], [[fog]], and some [[blocks]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, biomes specify their colors in the <code>[[Resource pack#Biomes|client_biome]]</code> JSON files in the [[Resource pack#Internal resource packs|vanilla resource packs]]. Some biomes specify their colors directly, while others use colormaps or separate JSON files which can also control other environmental effects.

{{IN|bedrock}}, all biome colors for blocks are also visible on [[maps]].<ref>{{bug|MC-130658}}</ref>

=== Plants ===
Biome grass and foliage colors are selected from three 256×256 colormap images: <code>grass.png</code>, <code>foliage.png</code>, and <code>dry_foliage</code> under {{cd|assets/minecraft/textures/colormap}}{{only|je|short=1}} or {{cd|textures/colormap}}{{only|be|short=1}} in the [[Resource pack#Internal resource packs|vanilla resource pack]]. The <code>grass.png</code> colormap sets the colors for [[grass block]], [[short grass]], [[tall grass]], [[fern]]s, [[large fern]]s, ferns in [[flower pot]]s, [[sugar cane]]s, [[bush]]es and stems of [[pink petals]] and [[wildflowers]]. Meanwhile, the {{cd|foliage.png}} colormap sets the colors for [[vines]] and tree [[leaves]] of oak, jungle, acacia, dark oak and mangrove. The {{cd|dry_foliage.png}} colormap sets the colors for [[leaf litter]]. Only the colors in the lower-left halfs of the images are used, even though the upper-right side of {{cd|foliage.png}} and {{cd|dry_foliage.png}} is colored.

<gallery>
Grasscolor.png|<samp>grass.png</samp>
foliage.png|<samp>foliage.png</samp>
dry_foliage.png|<samp>dry_foliage.png</samp>
</gallery>

The adjusted temperature and adjusted downfall values (recognized as AdjTemp and AdjDownfall in the following, respectively) are used when determining the biome color to select from the colormap. They are computed as follows:

<code>AdjTemp = clamp( Temperature, 0.0, 1.0 )</code>

<code>AdjDownfall = clamp( Downfall, 0.0, 1.0 ) * AdjTemp</code>.

"clamp" limits the range of the temperature and downfall to 0.0—1.0. The clamped downfall value is then multiplied by the adjusted temperature value, bringing its value to be inside the lower left triangle. Treating the bottom-right corner of the colormap as <code>AdjTemp = 0.0</code> and <code>AdjDownfall = 0.0</code>, the adjusted temperature increases to 1.0 along the X-axis, and the adjusted downfall increases to 1.0 along the Y-axis.

==== Special plant tints ====
In the following cases, the plants are not tinted exactly according to the colormap. {{IN|java}}, several of them are specified in [[custom biome|biome Json]]s in vanilla data pack. 

'''Swamps'''

In swamps and mangrove swamps, the grass color is based on a noise on XZ plane. When the value of this noise is less than -0.1, it uses the color {{color|#4c763c}}. Otherwise using {{Color|#6a7039}}. The foliage color is {{Color|#6a7039}} in swamps and {{Color|#8db127}} in mangrove swamps, which are not affected by the colormap. The dry foliage color in swamps and mangrove swamps is {{color|#7b5334}}, which also ignores the colormap.

{{IN|bedrock}}, all swamp biomes use colormaps to determine these colors, similar to regular colormaps described above.<gallery>

File:Swamp foliage.png|<samp>swamp_foliage.png</samp>
File:Mangrove swamp foliage.png|<samp>mangrove_swamp_foliage.png</samp>
</gallery>
'''Dark forest'''

In [[dark forest]]s, the grass color is the result of the bitwise AND between the color in the colormap and {{color|#fefefe}}, and then averaging with {{color|#28340a}}. In vanilla, that is {{Color|#507a32}}.

'''Badlands'''

In [[badlands]], [[wooded badlands]] and [[eroded badlands]], the grass color is {{Color|#90814d}} and the foliage color and dry foliage color is {{Color|#9e814d}}. They are not affected by the colormap.

'''Cherry grove'''

The color for grass and foliage in [[cherry groves]] is always {{Color|#b6db61}}, which is not affected by the colormap.

'''Pale garden'''

In the [[pale garden]], the grass color is {{Color|#778272}}, the foliage color is {{Color|#878d76}}, and the dry foliage color is {{Color|#a0a69c}} They are not affected by the colormap.

'''Other leaves'''

The color for spruce [[leaves]] is {{Color|#619961}} and the color for birch leaves is {{Color|#80a755}}. Both are not affected by the biome, but determined by colormaps {{In|be}}.<gallery>

</gallery>

=== Environment ===
The color of the daytime [[sky]] in Overworld changes according to the basic temperature value of the biome. The basic temperature is first modified as <code>T = clamp( Temperature / 3 , -1.0, 1.0 )</code>. Then the triple <code>(0.62222224-0.05T, 0.5+0.1T, 1)</code> is the sky color. 
The color of the sky in the [[Pale Garden|pale garden]] biome is {{color|#b9b9b9}}, which is unaffected by the above formula. See {{Slink|2=List of biome climates}} below for all sky colors.

The colors and surface opacity of [[water]] are defined in the vanilla data pack{{only|je|short=1}} or client biome JSON files in vanilla resource packs.{{only|be|short=1}} Some biomes {{In|je}}, or most biomes {{In|be}} have unique water colors. [[Swamps]] and [[Warm Ocean|warm oceans]] in ''Bedrock Edition'' have unique water surface opacities, 65% and 55% respectively.

The color and density of water and sky [[fog]] is different for most biomes, defined by separate JSON files for each biome in ''Bedrock Edition''. The underwater fog color is {{Color|#050533}} with a few exceptions in ''Java Edition'', or the same as the water surface color with some exceptions in ''Bedrock Edition''. The sky fog color is {{Color|#c0d8ff}}{{only|je|short=1}} or {{Color|#abd2ff}}{{only|be|short=1}} in all Overworld biomes, except pale gardens which use {{Color|#817770}}. Nether biomes and the End have unique fog colors.

==== Vibrant Visuals ====
[[Vibrant Visuals]] ignores default colors for the sky, water, and fog, and adds new effects for each biome or a set of biome. Which environmental settings are used is determined by the biome JSON file, and all environmental settings are stored in seperate directories in resource packs. In vanilla, the following effects are affected by the biome:

* '''Atmospherics''', which includes the sky colors. The sky color of a biome is defined at zenith and at the horizon, with specified heights where the colors are blended. [[Cloud]] colors change with the sky colors. The color, strength, and scattering effects of directional light sources (sun and moon) are also dependent on the biome. Furthermore, all these settings are constantly changing with the [[daylight cycle]], which also differs per biome. There are 17 different atmospherics and 15 different lighting settings defined for all biomes.
* '''Ambient lighting''', which is always applied to any surface, has different strengths depending on the [[dimension]]. This is 0.02 in the Overworld, 0.5 in the Nether, and 0.125 in the End.
* '''Volumetric fog''' is an additional layer of [[fog]] with large differences between biomes. There are 9 different fog effects, mainly depending on the biome's humidity, but some biomes like swamps and pale gardens have unique dense fog effects with different colors.
* '''Color grading''' is applied to the final image rendering. This rebalances saturation levels for RGB colors at different illumination levels, and changes the image's color temperature. There are 14 color grading settings defined for all biomes.

Water colors are not visible with Vibrant Visuals, but all regular fog colors still apply asides from the volumetric fog.

=== Transition ===
When plants or water are at the borders between or among biomes, the color is affected by the biome of the surrounding blocks at the same Y-level. The range of the block involved in the calculation is determined by the biome blend radius in [[options]]. Takes the plant color or water color of the biomes within a square centered on this block and with the side length being the biome blend radius, and calculates their average value to get the final color for this block.

The sky color{{only|je|short=1}} and the fog color use the color processed by {{w|Gaussian blur}} from colors of the biomes at each block in the range of 5×5×5 centered on the block the camera is in.

== Climate ==
{{For|climates in unused biomes|Biome/Before 1.18#Climate}}
A biome has three climate attributes: temperature, downfall and precipitation.

=== Temperature ===
Each biome has a '''base temperature''' value (see {{Slink|2=List of biome climates}}), but the actual temperature value at each location in the biome is also affected by the height of the location. Locations with Y≤80 use the base temperature as actual temperature. At Y=81, the actual temperature value randomly fluctuates up and down by -0.00875 — +0.01125 from the base temperature based on a noise on the XZ plane, and at Y≥81 the actual temperature decreases by 0.00125 ({{frac|1|800}}) every block up.

In [[frozen ocean]]s and [[deep frozen ocean]]s, it is also affected by a noise value on the XZ plane. In some regions according to the noise, the base temperature value is always regarded as 0.2. The actual temperature values for these regions are also calculated on this basis. This is detectable in [[frozen ocean]]s, as its base temperature is low enough to freeze or snow, so that only these regions do not freeze or snow at sea level.

The temperature affects at which height [[snowfall]] can occur, the sky and block colors, and whether [[sponges]] dry in the air.{{only|be|short=1}}

=== Downfall ===
The downfall value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (see {{Slink|2=List of biome climates}}). When the downfall value is greater than 0.85, the biome is marked as humid, which is related only to the random extinction of [[fire]] and block colors. This value doesn't affect the [[weather]].

=== Precipitation ===
The precipitation value can be "true" or "false". If the precipitation of the biome is false, no [[rain]] or [[Snowfall|snow]] occurs. Otherwise, a location is rainable when its temperature value is equal or greater than 0.15, and snowable otherwise.

So, if the base temperature is less than 0.15, it's snowable at any Y level. Even if equal or greater than 0.15, it will still snow above a certain Y level, which are listed below:

|}
The exact minimum height for snowfall is randomized per block, with a margin of 8 blocks. {{IN|bedrock}}, this is a transition layer where both snow and rain particles are visible at the same time. This transition also appears when moving horizontally between snowy and rainy biomes, and the particle density decreases when moving to a dry biome.

=== Snow accumulation ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, the amount of [[snow]] layers generated on the surface is based on the snow accumulation value of the biome. The snow height is randomly selected per block between a minimum and maximum value, with 0.0 being no snow and 1.0 being the full height of one block.

During snowfall, snow can stack infinitely on top of generated snow, unlike {{In|je}} where this is controlled by a snow accumulation [[game rule]].

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease|Re-added tundra as [[ice plains]].

|{{HistoryLine||1.1|dev=12w01a|Added the [[desert]], [[wooded hills]], [[taiga hills]], [[mountain edge]], and [[beach]] biomes.
|Smoothed color transitions between biomes – [[swampland]] grass, foliage and water smoothly transition into other biomes.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.2.1|dev=January 18, 2012|slink={{tweet|jeb_|159616418575421440}}|[[Jens Bergensten]] tweeted a teaser screenshot of a new [[jungle]] biome.}}

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w03a|Added the [[jungle]] biome.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w07a|The [[Anvil file format]] was introduced and it allows for biomes to be stored in the world data. In contrast, the [[Region file format]] relies on the [[world seed]] to dynamically calculate biome placement. This would cause biome placement in older worlds to change when the biome generation code was changed. With the current Anvil format, the biome data is stored along with the rest of the world data, meaning it does not change after the world is generated and can be edited by third-party map-editing tools. Furthermore, "edge" biomes allow for biomes to continue to extend beyond the edge chunks of an old world. This allows for smooth transitions in world generation after the generation code changes in an update.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w19a|Increased the scale and depth of [[desert hills]], [[forest hills]], [[extreme hills]], [[ice mountains]], [[jungle hills]] and [[taiga hills]] biomes.}}

|Biomes avoid getting placed next to a biome that is too different from itself, [[temperature]]-wise.
|The [[frozen ocean]] and [[extreme hills edge]] biomes no longer generate naturally.
|"[[Advancement#Adventuring_Time|Adventuring Time]]" achievement added, but it was broken until [[Java_Edition_1.8|1.8]], making the goal of getting all achievements impossible in [[Java_Edition_1.7.2|1.7]].}}

|"[[Advancement#Adventuring_Time|Adventuring Time]]" is now available without [[command]]s.

|Slightly tweaked the placements of all modified biomes.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=18w08a|Added ocean variants, including [[warm ocean]], [[lukewarm ocean]], [[cold ocean]], [[warm deep ocean]], [[deep lukewarm ocean]], [[deep cold ocean]] and [[deep frozen ocean]].
|[[Frozen ocean]] now generates naturally again, for the first time since [[13w36a]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=18w08b|[[Deep warm ocean]] biome no longer generates.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=18w16a|Biome names are now [[translate]]able.
|Cleaned up several biome names, mainly by adding missing spaces and changing "Biome M" for "Mutated Biome".}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=18w19a|Names of several biomes are changed. The exact name changes are listed [[18w19a#General 2|here]].}}

|{{HistoryLine||1.16|dev=20w06a|Implemented vertical biomes in the Nether.
|Added [[soul sand valley]]s, [[crimson forest]]s and [[warped forest]]s.

== Trivia ==
* The term ''biome'' is slightly similar to its scientific usage: in the real world, a biome is climatically and geographically defined by distinctive communities of plants, animals and soil organisms supported by similar climatic conditions. They are often referred to as {{w|ecosystem}}s.<ref>"[[Wikipedia:Biome|Biome]]" on Wikipedia</ref><ref>"[http://dictionary.com/browse/biome biome]" on Dictionary.com</ref> ''Minecraft'' biomes are defined by all of the blocks that compose them, not just the plants and animals found in them.
*A biome can sometimes generate with an area of only one block.<ref>{{bug|MC-69731||Random 1 block biome generating|WF}}</ref>
