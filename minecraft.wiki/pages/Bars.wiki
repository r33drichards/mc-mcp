[[File:All Bars.png|thumb|All bars.]]
'''Bars''' are [[block]]s that serve a similar purpose to [[glass pane]]s, but made out of certain metal [[ingot]]s instead of [[glass]].

== Variants ==
There are 9 variants of bars:
* {{BlockLink|id=all-copper-bars|Copper Bars}}
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Bars#Unoxidized|Copper Bars|Unoxidized Copper Bars}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Copper Bars|Waxed}})
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Bars#Exposed|Exposed Copper Bars}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Exposed Copper Bars|Waxed}})
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Bars#Weathered|Weathered Copper Bars}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Weathered Copper Bars|Waxed}})
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Bars#Oxidized|Oxidized Copper Bars}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Oxidized Copper Bars|Waxed}})
* {{BlockLink|Iron Bars}}

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
Both iron and regular unwaxed, unoxidized copper bars have the same crafting recipe format, where six ingots result in sixteen bars of the same type.

== Usage ==
[[File:Arrow Slits.png|thumb|Iron bars used to create arrow slits.]]
As with [[glass pane]]s and [[fence]]s, bars can be used to create narrow slits when placed between a [[door]] and a solid block. Mobs can see through and attack through these gaps, and arrows may be shot through them. Also as with fences and glass panes, arrows cannot be shot through bars themselves.

[[Endermen]] seen through bars do not become angry. The [[ender dragon]] cannot destroy iron bars (some of the [[end crystal]]s are protected by them), which makes them a useful material in [[the End]].

=== Placement ===
Bars can be placed in much the same way as [[fence]]s or [[glass pane]]s. If no solid block is adjacent to the bars, they have appearance of a slim, tall column. If something is placed next to bars, they appear either flat, [[File:Curve.png|text-top]] shaped, [[File:T junction.png|text-top]] shaped or [[File:Cross.png|text-top]] shaped, depending on the blocks surrounding it.
