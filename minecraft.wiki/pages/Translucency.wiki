{{distinguish|Transparency}}
{{Stub}}
'''Translucency''' is a concept very closely related to [[Opacity|transparency]]. Blocks, items, entities and other game elements said to be translucent allow for vision to pass through them partially, but not fully.

== Examples of translucent objects ==

=== Blocks ===

==== {{el|je}} ====
All translucent blocks use the <code>rendertype_translucent</code> [[Shader#List of core shaders|core shader]], with the exception of tripwire, which uses <code>rendertype_tripwire</code>.

==== Blocks that are not translucent, even though they'd be expected to ====
[[Water cauldron]]s, despite containing water, render this water as completely opaque. While it was rendered translucent as expected in prior versions, this seems to be inconsistent and possibly hardware-dependent, and when it fully stopped is currently unknown. Its opacity is also a parity issue, as cauldron water appears translucent as expected {{in|be}}. This persists to the present day.<ref>{{bug|MC-13187}}</ref>

Similarly, while tripwire itself is translucent, the region of tripwire which connects to a [[tripwire hook]] is not. This causes the region of tripwire attached to the tripwire hook to appear much darker than the rest of it.<ref>{{bug|MC-214692|||WF}}</ref>

=== Miscellaneous ===
{{Incomplete section|other translucent textures}}
These visuals are also rendered with translucency:
* The outer body of [[slime]]s.
* Certain [[particles]], like the swirls emitted from potion [[effect]]s.
* Certain [[Screen_effects#Overlays|screen overlays]] like the [[nether portal]] transition effect and the [[powder snow]] freezing overlays.
* [[Water]], while [[lava]] is not.
* The outer glow of [[Beacon#Beam|beacon beams]].
