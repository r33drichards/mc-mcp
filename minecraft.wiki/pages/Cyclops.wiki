'''Cyclops''' is a tall one-eye race of humans, that appears in the [[Minecraft Mini-Series]] and resides in the Maze of the Minotaur.

== Appearance ==
The Cyclops has a tall, thin build. He has one large eye in the middle of his head and a large nose underneath it. The top of his head is bald, but there is hair on the sides and back of his head. He is dressed in brown torn rags and also wears black bracelets with white spikes on his hands and feet.

== Biography ==
In 4 Episode of Season 2, after [[Quinn]], [[River]], [[Durango]] and [[CommuniKate]] made it through the maze, they briefly encountered the Cyclops, as well as [[Minotaur]] and [[Cerberus]], but as they prepared to attack, [[Zed]] dug a large hole underneath them, causing the Cyclops and Minotaur to fall into it while Cerberus flew away.
The trio also appeared in Season 2, Episode 8, when [[CommuniKate]] tried to stop the Command Block Statue from self-destructing.

== Power and Abilities ==
The series does not show his abilities, but he presumably has great strength, durability, and speed and can teleport.
