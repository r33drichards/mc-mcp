A '''zombie villager''' is a variant of the [[zombie]] that can be cured into a normal [[Villager (old)|villager]]{{info needed|Does it become an old villager in BE, or a new one?}} by {{ctrl|using}} a [[golden apple]] on it while it is has the [[Weakness]] effect.

== Spawning ==
When a group in the normal spawn cycle spawns zombies, there is a 5% chance to instead spawn a group of zombie villagers{{only|pocket}}, or a single zombie villager{{only|java}}. (This increases to a 20% chance in [[old growth taiga]] biomes){{only|java}}

If any type of [[zombie]] kills a [[villager]], there is a chance for the villager to transform into a zombie villager.

{{IN|Java}} a zombified zombie villager does not despawn if the player has traded with it at least once prior to its death, but unlike all other persistent mobs it still counts toward the hostile mob cap. If the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap. {{IN|Pocket}} all zombified villagers are persistent.

A zombie villager appears alongside a [[Villager|cleric]] villager in every [[igloo]] basement (a normal zombie villager in [[Pocket Edition]] and a cleric zombie villager in ''[[Java Edition]]''). One of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron). They also spawn in [[zombie village]]s. Zombie villagers generated in both of these structures do not despawn naturally.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable|edition=bedrock|nosource=1
|{{DropLine|name=Rotten Flesh|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Iron Ingot|notes=player_or_pet|dropchance=0.025|lootingchance=0.01|multiplychance=1/3}}
|{{DropLine|name=Carrot|notes=player_or_pet|dropchance=0.025|lootingchance=0.01|multiplychance=1/3}}
|{{DropLine|name=Potato|notes=player_or_pet|dropchance=0.025|lootingchance=0.01|multiplychance=1/3}}
}}
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

=== Naturally-spawned equipment ===
Zombie villagers do not spawn with equipment in ''Bedrock Edition''. In ''Java Edition'', a zombie villager can spawn with any of the following:
* {{BlockLink|Carved Pumpkin}} <ref name=":0" group="note">Zombie villagers spawn with [[pumpkin]]s and [[jack o'lantern]]s{{Only|java}} only during [[Wikipedia:Halloween|Halloween]].</ref>
* {{BlockLink|Jack o'Lantern}}{{only|java}}<ref name=":0" group="note" />
* {{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Iron Sword}}
* {{ItemLink|Iron Chestplate|Random Armor|link=Armor}}
* Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability. Each level of [[Looting]] increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III).

{{Notelist}}

=== Experience ===
Adult zombie villagers drop {{xp|5}} and an additional {{xp|1|3}} per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby zombie villagers drop {{xp|12}} experience.
