The '''Prismarine Cape''' is a personal [[cape]] that was given to a modder.

== Distribution ==
This cape was given to Drullkus by [[Jeb]] as appreciation for creating his own prismarine block texture for the Chisel mod instead of modifying Mojang's textures.<ref>{{tweet|Drullkus|744802175168086016|@tterrag1098 Wow! Looks sweet!
