A '''dead bush''' is a non-solid [[plant]] block found in [[desert]]s, [[badlands]], [[swamps]] and [[old growth taiga]]s. It can only be obtained with [[shears]], and otherwise drops [[stick]]s when broken.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Dead bushes [[drop]] 0–2 [[stick]]s when broken without [[shears]], or when the block below it is removed. [[Fortune]] enchantment doesn't affect the stick drop rates. When shears are used, a dead bush drops itself.

=== Natural generation ===
Dead bushes generate in [[desert]]s, [[badlands]], [[wooded badlands]], [[eroded badlands]], [[swamp]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s, [[old growth pine taiga]]s, and [[old growth spruce taiga]]s. They generate on [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[terracotta]], [[grass block]]s, [[podzol]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], and [[mud]].

Dead bushes generate twice as commonly in desert biomes as they do in old growth taigas, and 10 times more often in badlands than they do in deserts (ratio of 1:2:20 – taiga:desert:badlands).

Dead bushes generate in some entrance rooms of [[trial chambers]], next to a cactus. They can also be found inside [[flower pot]]s inside some desert [[village]] houses and in trial chambers.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|dead-bush}}

== Usage ==
Dead bushes can be used for aesthetic decoration, as a source of [[stick]]s and a [[fuel]] source. A dead bush can be placed on any kind of [[sand]], [[terracotta]], [[dirt]], [[podzol]] and [[mud]]; they can also be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[mycelium]], and [[moss block]]s. They can also be planted in [[flower pot]]s. Dead bushes do not spread, and cannot be grown using [[bone meal]].

Unlike most plants, dead bushes cannot be [[compost]]ed.<ref>{{bug|MC-219904}}</ref>

=== Fuel ===
Dead bushes can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.5 items per dead bush.

=== Ambience ===
If placed on [[sand]], [[red sand]] or a [[terracotta]] block of any kind with at least one more corresponding block underneath it, dead bushes produce [[Ambience|ambient sounds]] reminiscent of dry leaves rustling, wind howling and insects rattling. These ambient sounds can play anywhere if the given conditions are met, and naturally play in the [[badlands]] and [[desert]] biomes due to the abundance of dead bushes on top of said blocks.
