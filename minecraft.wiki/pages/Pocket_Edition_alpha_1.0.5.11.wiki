'''1.0.5 build 3''' (also known as '''Alpha 1.0.5.11''' or '''Alpha 1.0.5.13 re-release''') is the third and final build version released for [[Pocket Edition 1.0.5|1.0.5]].<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360004125472|title=MCPE Android Beta - 1.0.5 Build 3}}</ref>

== Changes ==
* Entities will no longer spawn in lava with the {{cmd|spreadplayers}} command

== Fixes ==
* {{bug|MCPE-18181}} Chorus plants now make the correct sounds.
* {{bug|MCPE-19719}} Maps zoomed out on an anvil now work the same for all players
* Fixed a crash when attempting to place any irrelevant item in Horse Armor slot using {{cmd|replaceitem}} command
* Fixed several bugs with the {{cmd|replaceitem}} command

== Trivia ==
* This beta build unintentionally allowed beta users access to their Realms. If a beta user using this build accessed their Realm, the Realm would upgrade to 1.0.5 which would only allow the Realm owner and those also on the beta build to access the build until the full 1.0.5 release.</onlyinclude>
