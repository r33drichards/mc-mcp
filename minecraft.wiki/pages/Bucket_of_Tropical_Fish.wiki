A '''bucket of tropical fish''', internally known as a '''tropical fish bucket''', is a living [[tropical fish]] inside of a [[water bucket]], in the form of an item.

== Obtaining ==
A bucket of tropical fish can be obtained by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on a [[tropical fish]]. Once a water bucket is used, the tropical fish is picked up along with the water source block.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s occasionally sell a bucket of tropical fish for 3 [[emerald]]s. When placed, a bucket of tropical fish bought from a wandering trader has a random variant.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
Pressing {{control|use}} with a bucket of tropical fish places a [[water]] source block, and spawns the tropical fish back into the world, leaving an [[bucket|empty bucket]] in the [[player]]'s [[inventory]]. Placing a bucket of tropical fish in [[the Nether]] causes the same [[particle]]s to appear that generate when a normal water bucket is placed in the Nether, and the tropical fish is spawned alone.

Tropical fish caught in buckets and then released do not despawn, unlike naturally spawning aquatic mobs.

If a bucket of tropical fish is inside a [[dispenser]], the dispenser spawns the tropical fish and water block in front of it upon activation, leaving an empty bucket inside. Dispensers cannot pick up a tropical fish when using a water bucket, due to the bucket being emptied instead.

If a bucket of tropical fish is named a certain name through an [[anvil]], the tropical fish inside displays that name as if it were named with a [[Name Tag|name tag]].{{Only|java}} Alternatively, if a named tropical fish is captured with a bucket of water, the resulting bucket of tropical fish shares a name with the captured tropical fish.{{Only|java}} If a named tropical fish is captured {{in|Bedrock}}, the item is called "Bucket of <Name>".

=== Breeding ===
Additionally, buckets of tropical fish may be used to [[breed]] and lead [[axolotl]]s and tamed [[nautilus]]es. It can also speed up the growth of a baby axolotl and nautilus. Although they can be fed to tamed [[zombie nautiluses]], they cannot breed with them.

=== Tropical fish variants ===
<onlyinclude>Tropical fish also have assigned names that can be seen after capture. {{IN|Java}}, the smaller text under the item name is displayed showing the fish name, similar to the text that displays [[Enchanting|enchantments]] under enchanted items. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the item name is displayed showing "Bucket of <fish name>". Their colors are mostly named according to the [[Java Edition data values#Carpet|colored block]] names, though with a few exceptions:

<div class="list-style-none" style="-moz-column-width:10em;-webkit-column-width:10em;column-width:10em">

*{{BlockLink|Light Gray Concrete|link=none|text=Silver}}

*{{BlockLink|Purple Concrete|link=none|text=Plum}}
*{{BlockLink|Magenta Concrete|link=none|text=Magenta}}
*{{BlockLink|Pink Concrete|link=none|text=Rose}}
</div>

The base color comes first, and if the pattern color is different, it comes after that. Lastly, the fish bucket is given a name according to the shape and pattern of the fish:

Some tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system, and instead, reference real-life fish species. Apart from these names, these types of fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.

These varieties are:

A bucket of tropical fish purchased from a [[wandering trader]] or pulled from the [[Creative inventory]] spawns random tropical fish when used, due to it having no associated NBT.
