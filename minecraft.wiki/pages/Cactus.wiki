{{relevant tutorial|Cactus farming}}
A '''cactus''' is a [[plant]] block found in [[desert]]s and [[badlands]]. It grows over time and can sprout [[Cactus Flower|cactus flowers]]. It damages [[Mob|mobs]] and destroys [[Minecart|minecarts]] and [[Item (entity)|dropped items]] that touch it.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A cactus can be mined by hand without taking damage. The [[tool]] used to mine the cactus does not affect mining speed.<ref>{{bug|MC-175179||Cactus blocks do not have an assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Cactus}}
If a cactus becomes unsupported (e.g., due to a [[block]] being placed next to it or its base removed), it breaks and drops as an [[item]]. 

A cactus also removes and drops itself as an item if a [[piston]] tries to push it, or moves a block into its space. Trying to pull it with a sticky piston does nothing. 

Using a [[sign]] on the side of a cactus causes both the sign and the cactus to drop as items.

=== Natural generation ===
Cacti naturally generate in [[desert]] and [[badlands]] biomes (twice more common in desert than in badlands). They generate as one ({{frac|11|18}} chance), two ({{frac|5|18}} chance), or three ({{frac|2|18}} chance) blocks tall. Rarely taller cacti can be found if generation chooses to generate another on top of one already generated (although not as commonly as [[sugar cane]]).

A [[potted cactus]] can also be found in an [[igloo]] with a basement.
Potted cacti and 3 block cactus can also be found in some desert village buildings.

Cacti also have a {{frac|2|9}} (22.2%) chance to generate in the entrance chamber of [[trial chambers]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
[[Endermen]] can pick up cacti. If an enderman is holding a cactus when it dies, the cactus will be dropped.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|cactus}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 cactus for 3 [[emerald]]s.
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
A cactus block can be placed only on [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[suspicious sand]], or another cactus block. A cactus breaks itself (and drops as an item) if any [[block]] with the [[legacy solid]] property, or [[lava]], occupies any of the 4 horizontally adjacent blocks. It also breaks if on the sand and the block above is [[water]] or lava.

When most [[entities]], including [[player]]s and [[mob]]s, touch a cactus, it deals {{hp|1}} [[damage]] every tick (although [[damage immunity]] reduces this to once every half-second). Damage from touching a cactus is reduced by [[armor]], and touching it also damages the armor. Mobs do not avoid cactus when they pathfind. Notably, [[armor stand]]s are exempt from this.

A cactus destroys any [[item]]s that come into contact with it, including other cactus in item form. [[Falling block]]s such as [[sand]] and [[gravel]] are not destroyed when falling onto cactus; instead, they are transformed into item form (as happens when it falls into any block with a hitbox that has a height less than 1, such as [[slab]]s or [[button]]s). The item created in this case is sometimes (though not always) destroyed by the cactus. The conversion to an item applies even when the falling block is a cactus (which is possible with {{cmd|summon}}).<!-- example: /summon minecraft:falling_block ~4 ~4 ~ {BlockState:{Name:"minecraft:cactus"},Time:1} -->

When a [[minecart]] hits a cactus block, the minecart drops as an item and is often destroyed, although a [[hopper]] can pick it up faster.

A cactus can also be placed in a [[flower pot]], where it is harmless.

A cactus (excluding its spikes) is {{frac|7|8}} of a block in width (the same as [[chest]]s) and a full block in height, however the [[Solid block|collision box]] is {{frac|15|16}} of a block high.

=== Farming ===
{{main|Tutorial:Cactus farming}}

Cacti naturally grow to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top cactus block has received 16 random [[tick]]s (i.e. on average every 18 minutes<!-- Average 68.27 seconds/tick * 16 ticks/growth = 18.2 minutes -->, but the actual rate can vary very widely). [[Bone meal]] does not work on cacti to speed their growth.<ref>{{bug|MC-73963||Can't use bone meal on cacti or sugar cane|WAI}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-73214||Cactus cannot be bone meal|WAI}}</ref>A cactus does not need [[light]] to grow and is non-flammable. If a cactus has space directly above it, it grows even if the newly-grown block would immediately break due to adjacent blocks.

A cactus also has a chance to grow a [[cactus flower]] at any height. This happens after a cactus block has received exactly 9 random [[tick]]s (i.e. earlier than growing another cactus block){{verify|edition=bedrock}}. If the cactus is 1 or 2 blocks tall the chance is 10%, at 3 or more blocks tall the chance is 25%. A cactus flower can only grow if there are no blocks in any cardinal directly adjacent to it. A cactus with a cactus flower can no longer grow. When the cactus flower is broken by a player, the cactus may grow taller but can't generate another cactus flower until it has grown at least 1 cactus block.

=== Smelting ingredient ===
Cactus provides the highest [[smelting]] XP of any farmable block in ''Java Edition''.

=== Breeding ===
Cacti can be used to breed [[camel]]s and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby camels by 10%. Camels also follow a player holding a cactus.

=== Composting ===
Placing a cactus into a [[composter]] has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Cactus|Cacti}}

== Trivia ==
* Cacti can be placed in 1 block deep [[water]], provided they are placed on [[sand]], and they grow if they break the surface.
* Cacti can be placed next to [[sapling]]s, but the cactus breaks when the [[tree]] grows.
* [[Endermen]] could move and place cacti. Thus, they can increase the cactus population in [[desert]]s by moving cactus blocks as they grow.
* [[Sign]]s and [[painting]]s can be placed on the sides of cacti and behave as non-blocks, making them cause damage even though they are covering cacti.
* It is possible for cacti to generate on blocks other than sand due to [[generated structures|terrain generation]]; refer to the gallery for examples.
* Cactus can be used in the desert to see if the [[player]] is in a newly generated area. If most of the cacti around the player is only one block high, then it is most likely new land.
* Dying from touching a cactus displays "[playername] was pricked to death" in the chat messages.
* [[Block]]s can be placed on top of a cactus, including other cactus blocks.
* It is possible to place [[redstone]] next to a cactus block without destroying it.
* A 20 block tall cactus can be found on the seed 43931985876593125 at coordinates (-9711824 , ~ , 7726416) and more recently a 22 block tall one on seed 11343195073417814 at coordinates (14955936 , ~ , -3750655) and even a 23 block tall one on the seed 184693195438010998 and coordinates (16274576 ~ 10230656). All these seeds, found by the Minecraft@home research project, work on Java Edition 1.14.4.<ref>{{Tweet|minecraftathome|1275401340731232256|With data generated from volunteer computers on our BOINC network, the tallest known cactus in #Minecraft was discovered yesterday at the 20 blocks high.<br><br>Seed: 43931985876593125<br>Position: -9711824 7726416}}</ref>
* Top snow can be placed next to cacti without breaking the cacti, no matter how many top snow layers stack.
