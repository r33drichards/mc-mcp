{{IN|be|lce|3ds}}, a '''texture pack''' is a type of [[DLC|downloadable content]] that can be bought from the [[Marketplace]] (or the platform's storefront {{in|LCE}}) which customizes the appearance of the game by replacing the default [[textures]].

In addition to separately available texture packs, [[mash-up packs]] come bundled with texture packs as well.

==Trivia==
*The “Siamese” cat in the City texture pack has been changed to resemble a Sphinx cat, while “silverfish” now resemble cockroaches.
*In [[Pocket Edition v0.15.0 alpha]], the default texture of the [[Nether Reactor Core]] was changed to the Plastic Texture Pack texture and as a result, the Plastic Texture Pack had the default texture. The bug was never fixed.
