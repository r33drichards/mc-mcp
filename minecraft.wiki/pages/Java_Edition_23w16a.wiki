'''23w16a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20]], released on April 20, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w16a|April 20, 2023}}</ref> which adds a new command and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format === 
'''{{cmd|return}}'''
* A new command that can be used to control execution flow inside functions and change their return value. Effects:
** Skip remaining separate top-level commands in the currently executing function (if any).
** The result value of the function command that triggered the execution is changed from the number of commands executed to the value.
** The result value of the return command is also the value.
* Syntax: {{cmd|link=none|return <value>}}
** <code>value</code>: An integer return value.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added <code>recipe_crafted</code> advancement trigger; triggered when crafting a recipe.
** Conditions:
*** <code>recipe_id</code>: The resource location of the recipe crafted.
*** <code>ingredients</code>: An array of predicates for the item stacks used in the recipe.
**** A single item stack can only be used to fulfill one predicate.
**** Each predicate needs to be fulfilled to trigger the advancement. This allows for seperation between recipes that have same identifier but use different ingredients.
**** This field is optional. When not provided, or left empty, only the <code>recipe_id</code> dictates the success of the trigger.

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added splashes: 
** This sand is sus
** Remember to brush your... ...teeth
** Has working bookshelves!
** Sniff sniff...
** Place hanging sign here

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added block tags:
** <code>#maintains_farmland</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|pumpkin_stem|pumpkin|attached_pumpkin_stem|melon_stem|melon|attached_melon_stem|beetroots|carrots|potatoes|torchflower_crop|torchflower|pitcher_crop|wheat}}
*** Blocks that don't cause farmland to be converted into dirt when placed on top of it.
* Added item tags:
** <code>#villager_plantable_seeds</code>: contains {{cd|d=and|wheat_seeds|potato|carrot|beetroot_seeds|torchflower_seeds|pitcher_pod}}.
*** Seeds that villagers use to farm.
* Added block and item tags:
** <code>#stone_buttons</code>: contains <code>stone_button</code> and <code>polished_blackstone_button</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Polished Blackstone Button JE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Polished Blackstone Button]]'''
* Now breaks in the same time as other buttons.

[[File:Calibrated Sculk Sensor JE2.gif|width=32x32]] '''[[Calibrated Sculk Sensor]]'''
* The model has been changed from [[File:Calibrated Sculk Sensor JE1.gif|width=32x32]]: the top of the amethyst is now unshadowed and stretched to match the model of the [[amethyst cluster]].

[[File:Pitcher Crop Age 4 JE1 BE1.png|width=42x42]] '''[[Pitcher Pod|Pitcher Crop]]'''
* Hitbox shape has been changed for each stage of its growth.

[[File:Pitcher Plant JE1 BE1.png|width=62x62]] '''[[Pitcher Plant]]'''
* Is now flammable.

[[File:Sculk Sensor JE1.gif|width=32x32]] [[File:Sculk Shrieker JE2 BE3.gif|width=32x32]] '''[[Sculk Sensor]] and [[sculk Shrieker]]'''
* If a vibration is scheduled to be received by a sculk sensor or sculk shrieker, they stay queued until all adjacent chunks are loaded and ticking.
** This prevents vibration resonance setups from breaking when unloading their chunks from a distance.

[[File:Torchflower JE1 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Torchflower]]'''
* No longer makes [[farmland]] turn into [[dirt]].
* Is now flammable.

[[File:Decorated Pot (N) JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Decorated Pot]]'''
* Tag for pot decorations renamed from <code>shards</code> to <code>sherds</code> (to match items).

=== Items ===
[[File:Archer Pottery Sherd JE2 BE2.png|width=32x32]] '''[[Pottery Sherd]]'''
* Renamed from "Pottery Shard".

=== Mobs ===
[[File:Sniffer JE1 BE1.png|width=50x50]] '''[[Sniffer]]s'''
* No longer sniff while panicking.
* No longer dig while having the [[Levitation]] effect.
* Can now enter [[minecart]]s.

[[File:Plains Villager Base JE2.png|width=43x43]] '''[[Villager]]s'''
* Can now plant [[torchflower seeds]] and [[pitcher pod]]s.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]]'''
* <code>item_display</code> items have been rotated 180 degrees around Y axis to better match transformation applied when rendering items on armor stand head and in item frames.
** For reference, order of transformations applied to model (starting from innermost) is <code>item_transform</code>, rotate Y 180, <code>transformation</code> field, entity orientation (<code>billboard</code> option + <code>Rotation</code> field + <code>Pos</code> field).

=== World generation ===
[[File:Trail Ruins.png|width=82x82]] '''[[Trail Ruins]]'''
* Reworked and added more variants.
* No longer generates with [[sand]] and [[suspicious sand]].
* Tweaked the amount of [[gravel]], [[dirt]], and [[suspicious gravel]].
* Split the archaeological loot tables for the suspicious gravel within the structure.
** Rare loot items and common loot items now each have their own dedicated archaeological loot table.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Version is now <code>14</code>.

'''[[Loading world screen]]'''
* Changed chunk colormap a little.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed <code>stone_button</code> and <code>polished_blackstone_button</code> from the <code>#buttons</code> block and item tags, newly added <code>#stone_buttons</code> is used instead.
* Removed <code>stone_button</code> from the <code>#mineable/pickaxe</code> block tag, newly added <code>#stone_buttons</code> is used instead.
* Removed {{cd|d=and|sand|dirt|coarse_dirt}} from the <code>#trail_ruins_replaceable</code> block tag.
* Renamed <code>#decorated_pot_shards</code> item tag to <code>#decorated_pot_sherds</code>, and renamed all its members accordingly.

'''General'''
* The game's application icon has been changed from [[crafting table]] to [[grass block]].
** Uses dirt icon for snapshots.
* Added native support for ARM64 machine architecture on Windows.
** Needs to manually specify a native Java Executable in the launcher currently.
