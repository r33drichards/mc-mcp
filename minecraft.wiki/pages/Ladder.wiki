The '''ladder''' is a [[block]] used for climbing walls either vertically or horizontally. They can be placed only on the sides of other blocks.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break ladder is [[axe]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Ladder|Axe}}
Ladder drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
Ladders generate naturally in library rooms of [[stronghold]]s and in intersection rooms with a wooden ceiling. Ladders can also be found in [[village]] structures such as [[Village/Structures|plains and taiga temple]]s and many small or medium houses, as well as in churches. They may also be found leading to the basements of [[igloo]]s, in [[end ship]]s on the pillar leading up to the crow's nest, and in rail rooms of [[woodland mansion]]s. Ladders can also generate in [[ancient cities]], [[trail ruins]], [[trial chambers]], and in [[end cities]].

== Usage ==
Ladders provide a way to cushion a [[player]]'s impact after a free fall. Upon entering a ladder's area of effect, the player's speed is reduced instantly to normal ladder descent speed and no damage is taken. Falling onto the narrow top surface of the ladder incurs falling damage as normal.

Holding the {{control|sneak}} key while climbing a ladder causes the player to grab hold of the ladder and not fall off. While the player is holding on to a ladder, mining speed decreases.

Any [[mob]] ''can'' climb a ladder in the same way a player does: by pushing against it. Mobs cannot use ladders deliberately — they do not remain on a ladder to get somewhere, but a ladder directly in their path lets them climb up.

=== Placement ===
Ladders can be placed on any full solid block face.

Ladders displace [[lava]] blocks to create an [[air]] pocket and can be used instead of [[glass]] to let lava light shine through a ceiling. They also displace flowing water, but a ladder placed inside a [[water]] source block becomes [[waterlogged]] and does not create an air pocket.

=== Climbing ===
A ladder takes effect whenever the [[player]]'s lower half is in the block occupied by a ladder. These effects are:
* If the player pushes against a wall, the player moves upward at about 2.35 blocks per second instead of horizontally. (Thus inside a 1×1 ladder shaft, the player can use any movement key to move upward.)
* If a player occupies the 1×1 ladder shaft, the player can ascend the ladder by holding {{ctrl|jump}} instead of using a horizontal movement key.
* If a player moving perpendicular to the ladder block enters the ladder block, the player begins to move upward, but then falls off the ladder shortly afterward if the player continues to move horizontally.
* The player's maximum downward speed is reduced to a "descending ladder" speed, at about 3 blocks per second.
* The player's horizontal movement friction is the same as on [[ice]]. (That is, moving around in the tiny space the player is in while still hanging on the ladder at the same level.)

Additionally:
* In ''Bedrock Edition'', a player can hold down the jump button while climbing a ladder to make the climbing speed faster.
* Also in ''Bedrock Edition'', waterlogged ladders cannot be climbed.
* In ''Java Edition'', when a [[trapdoor]] satisfies the following conditions, it also becomes climbable:
** The trapdoor is placed directly above a ladder.
** The trapdoor is opened.
** The trapdoor and the ladder directly below it face the same direction.
* A player on a [[slab]] in front of the ladder must jump to get on the ladder despite being only half a block down.
* Like [[vine]]s, ladders slow the player down when walked through.
* Consuming [[food]], blocking with a [[shield]] or pulling back a [[bow]], do not slow the player down while climbing ladders (unlike when [[walking]], [[sprinting]] and [[swimming]]).<ref>{{bug|MC-12305|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Fuel ===
A ladder can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, [[smelting]] 1.5 [[item]]s per ladder.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* It is possible to use ladders one [[block]] apart in a corner by placing every other ladder on the alternating side of the corner. This method requires jumping and shifting sides constantly.
* By holding the jump key, players can still use [[water]] ladders that have ladders placed every other block.
* Attempting to place a ladder on a spot another ladder occupies may instead place the ladder somewhere nearby (because of the ladder's hitbox).
* It is possible to remove a ladder while standing on a ladder and holding the sneak key, but it can take a long time because the countdown for breaking the ladder often resets.
* In ''Java Edition'', [[stick]]s can be crafted into ladders to gain a slight bonus in [[fuel]] efficiency. While 7 sticks can smelt 3.5 items, if they are crafted into 3 ladders, 4.5 items can be smelted.
