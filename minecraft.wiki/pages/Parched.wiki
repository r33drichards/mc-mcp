A '''parched''' is a [[skeleton]] variant that spawns in [[desert]]s. Parched behave similarly to skeletons, but have less [[health]], do not burn in [[sun]]light, fire their [[bow]]s more slowly, take freeze damage and cannot convert to [[stray]]s, and shoot [[tipped arrow]]s of [[Weakness]].

== Spawning ==
Parched can [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in [[desert]]s at night, replacing some [[skeleton]]s.

{{IN|java}}, parched spawn directly under the sky in groups of 4 in place of 50% of all skeletons spawned in desert biomes.

{{IN|bedrock}}, parched spawn on the surface in groups of 2-4 in place of {{frac|1|3}} (~33%) of all skeletons spawned in desert biomes. 

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Camel husk jockeys ===
When a [[husk]] spawns [[spawn cycle|naturally]] and spawns in a space that does not block the collision box required for a [[camel husk]], it has a 10% chance to spawn as a [[camel husk jockey]], i.e. riding a camel husk, and spawning a parched as the second passenger.

=== Spider jockeys ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}[[Spider]]s and [[cave spider]]s spawned in deserts have a 1% chance to spawn as a [[spider jockey]], with an 80% chance of the rider being a parched.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Bone|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Arrow|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
|{{DropLine|name=Arrow of Weakness|notes=player|quantity=0-1|lootingquantity=0-1|limit=1}}
}}
* Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up. 
* Any naturally spawned equipment, including the [[bow]], has an 8.5% chance of dropping (9.5% with [[Looting]] I, 10.5% with Looting II and 11.5% with Looting III). It is damaged and may be enchanted. 
* {{xp|5}} [[experience]] orbs when killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]] and an extra {{xp|1|3}} if the parched has [[armor]].

== Behavior ==
Parched mostly behave like normal [[skeleton]]s but shoot extended [[arrows of Weakness]] instead of normal arrows. Their cooldown between each [[bow]] shot is longer than normal skeletons at every 3.5 seconds on Easy and Normal and every 2.5 seconds on Hard. Parched do not burn in sunlight. Parched are unaffected by the [[Weakness]] effect, although this does not usually affect them anyway, since they attack using projectiles.

{{IN|be}}, parched ride [[camel husk]]s when pushed into one.

{{IN|be}}, the eyes of parched are [[emissive]] when [[Vibrant Visuals]] is enabled.

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] [[enchantment]].
* Unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

As they are also under the "skeletons" [[entity type tag]]{{only|java}}, if a parched kills a [[creeper]], the creeper drops a [[music disc]], randomly selected from [[13]], [[Music Disc cat|cat]], [[Music Disc blocks|blocks]], [[chirp]], [[far]], [[mall]], [[mellohi]], [[stal]], [[strad]], [[ward]], [[11]], and [[wait]]. They will also run away from wild and tamed wolves similar to other skeleton variants.

Similar to [[bogged]], parched take freezing [[damage]] and do not convert into [[stray]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-268579||Bogged in powder snow freeze on death instead of converting to Stray|WAI}}</ref> Unlike [[husk]]s, parched do not turn into skeletons when submerged in [[water]] for too long.
