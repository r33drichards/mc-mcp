'''Vibrations''' are a gameplay mechanic based around the concept of [[sound]] and its physical interactions. Most in-game actions and events produce vibrations of different frequencies, or intensity. [[Wool]] can be used to dampen or block vibrations and prevent them from traveling if collided with. Vibrations are solely utilized by [[sculk sensor]]s, [[sculk shriekers]], [[warden]]s, and [[allay]]s. 

== Mechanics ==
When a vibration is created, it takes the appearance of blue-cyan "sound wave" [[particle]]s which moves from its source of origin to the entity which detected it. Vibration waves move at a constant speed, and their speed cannot be altered.

{{Expand section|''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' values}}
Each vibration in the game falls under a certain frequency value. This value can be measured with a [[comparator]]. With the right contraption utilizing a [[calibrated sculk sensor]] or [[sculk sensor]], the player could detect if a certain action has occurred or is occurring  nearby.

=== Sources which are not detected ===
The following occurrences, despite presumably causing physical motion, do not produce vibrations and therefore cannot be detected: 
*Blocks destroyed by a fluid flowing into their space<ref>{{bug|MC-207410}}</ref>
*Several blocks being destroyed due to their supporting block being removed:<ref>{{bug|MC-207411}}</ref>
**Rails
**Powered rails
**Detector rails
**Activator rails
**Redstone wire
**Redstone repeaters
**Redstone comparators
*Several cases where a [[dispenser]] fails to perform an action:<ref>{{bug|MC-208142}}</ref>
**Flint and steel not creating fire
**Bone meal not growing something
**Heads and carved pumpkins, if not equipped on something or placed
**Shulker boxes, if not placed
**Shears, if there's nothing to shear
**Glowstone, if it doesn't charge a respawn anchor
*Inserting an [[eye of ender]] into an [[end portal frame]]<ref>{{bug|MC-208805}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-209798}}</ref>
*Eyes of ender breaking<ref>{{bug|MC-210153}}</ref>
*[[Silverfish]] entering blocks<ref>{{bug|MC-210283}}</ref>
*[[Water]] and [[lava]] flowing into existing spaces, or drying up<ref>{{bug|MC-210482}}</ref>
*Changing the mode of a [[redstone comparator]]<ref>{{bug|MC-211331}}</ref>
*Changing the delay on a [[redstone repeater]]<ref>{{bug|MC-214621}}</ref>
*Changing the shape of a single unit of [[redstone wire]]<ref>{{bug|MC-214623}}</ref>
*[[Fire]] extinguished by rain<ref>{{bug|MC-251525}}</ref>

The following cases have been confirmed to be intentional: 
*[[Axolotl]]s being bred via tropical fish buckets<ref name="axo-bucket">{{bug|MC-208799|||WAI}}</ref>
*[[Moss block]]s replacing existing blocks<ref>{{bug|MC-214210|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Amethyst resonation ===
When a block of amethyst is placed adjacent to a [[sculk sensor]] or a [[calibrated sculk sensor]], if that sculk sensor receives a [[vibration]], the block of amethyst re-emits its frequency as a separate vibration at its location. This vibration can then be detected by another sculk sensor, allowing a chain of sculk sensors and amethyst blocks to be created, transmitting a signal wirelessly.

=== Vibration occlusion ===
[[Wool]] can be used to block vibrations from reaching nearby [[sculk sensor]]s. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect vibrations behind it. Similarly, if a wool block is placed between a sensor and a [[sculk shrieker]], the sensor is unable to alert the shrieker. 

Sculk sensors are not able to detect the placing and breaking of wool, as well as entities [[walking]], [[sprinting]], or [[jumping]] on top of it. They are also unable to detect [[Item (entity)|items]] dropped on wool, or wool itself dropped in item form.

Similar to sculk sensors, [[warden]]s are also unable to detect everything wool-related as listed above.

Wool can also be used to block [[note block]] sounds from reaching [[allays]].
