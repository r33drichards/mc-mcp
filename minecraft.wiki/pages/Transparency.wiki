'''Transparency''' may refer to:

* [[Opacity]], which describes whether a block completely obstructs vision or not. This quality also affects light propagation.
* [[Translucency]], which allows textures to be rendered as partially transparent.
* [[Conductivity]], a property of blocks that determines whether redstone signals can be conducted through them.
* For [[mob spawning|spawning]], a block may be called ''transparent'' if it does not have a [[Solid block|solid]] upper face.
