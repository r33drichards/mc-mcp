'''Riding''', also known as '''mounting''', is the behavior that allows an entity to mount another entity.

== Behaviors ==
Riding connects one entity to another. An entity riding another entity is called a '''passenger''' (or '''rider'''), and an entity being ridden is called a '''mount''' (or '''vehicle'''). An entity can be both a passenger and a mount at the same time if it is riding another entity while being ridden by other entities.

An entity can only ride at most one entity at the same time. Most entities support only one passenger, but [[boat]]s, [[bamboo raft]]s, [[camel]]s and [[camel husk]]s can support two passengers at the same time, while a [[happy ghast]] can support four passengers at the same time. {{IN|java}}, by modifying entity NBT through commands, an entity may be ridden by any number of entities. {{IN|bedrock}}, a baby [[hoglin]] can support 3 baby piglins, which looks like they are stacked one by one. However, {{in|java}}, baby piglins ride each other and are indeed stacked one by one, instead of all riding on the hoglin. {{IN|bedrock}}, a player can support 2 [[parrot]]s. However, {{in|java}}, parrots become not entities and are stored into the player's NBT data when sitting on the shoulders of a player.

The collision and movement of a mount is not affected by its passengers, so the accessible position for the mount may put the passengers into danger, for example, making the passenger's head inside of a block and causing [[suffocation]].<ref>{{bug|MC-477|||WAI}}</ref> However, {{in|java}}, a passenger riding on a passenger of an entity collides with the entity, resulting in bugs like {{bug|MC-71998}}.

{{IN|java}}, when dismounting, players will be placed on different sides of the mount, depending on the [[Options|main hand]] of that player. 

When a [[player]] leaves a world, all entities riding or being ridden by that player will also disappear from the world, and will reappear with the player when they rejoin the world, unless the affected entity has another player passenger.

{{IN|java}}, with {{cmd|ride}} command, all entities are rideable by any entity, except [[marker]] and [[player]], which never can be ridden. {{IN|bedrock}}, only some riding combinations are valid for {{cmd|ride}} command (see {{section link||Valid riding combinations in vanilla}}.)

{{IN|java}}, when a leashed mob starts riding, it drops the [[lead]]. {{IN|bedrock}}, a leashed mob cannot start riding unless using the {{cmd|ride}} command, and when starting riding, it doesn't drop the [[lead]].

A passenger cannot set its mount as its target for attack. A mount cannot set its passenger as the target for attack either, unless using the {{cmd|damage}} command. {{IN|bedrock}}, they cannot attack each other at all even when they target each other through the {{cmd|damage}} command.

=== Passengers ===
Passengers have the following behaviors:

*The position of a passenger is fixed on its mount; that is, the position and movement of a passenger cannot be affected by any other gameplay features.
**Passengers have no collision with entities and blocks.
**Passengers cannot be moved by [[damage#knockback|knockback]], [[explosion]], [[fishing rod]], and [[trident]] with [[riptide]] enchantment.
**{{IN|bedrock}}, passengers cannot be teleported by [[chorus fruit]] and [[End Gateway (block)|end gateway]]. 
**{{IN|java}}, when a passenger goes into an [[End Gateway (block)|end gateway]], it is teleported with its mount. 
**When a [[shulker]] is a passenger, it cannot teleport on its own. {{IN|java}}, an [[enderman]] cannot teleport on its own either.
**Passengers dismount when teleported by {{cmd|tp}}.
**{{IN|java}}, using the /data command to change a mob's position will not make it dismount. The newly-given position will last only until entities are processed later in the [[Tick#Game_process|tick]], and will not be visually noticeable.
*Passengers can be transported by [[Nether Portal (block)|nether portals]] or [[End Portal (block)|end portals]].<ref name="MC-67">{{bug|MC-67|||Fixed}}</ref>
*Passengers do not calculate the falling height. When starting riding, the falling height is reset.
*When a player is a passenger, it cannot interact with its mount.
*When a player is a passenger, it cannot interact with other passengers on the same mount as it.
*When a player is a passenger and the mount is a mob or an armor stand, the [[health]] bar of the mount is displayed on the player's [[HUD]] in the form of {{healthbar|2|mob=1}}. {{IN|Java}}, the hunger bar is replaced by it in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode.

=== Mounts ===
Mounts have the following behaviors:

*Mounts can be transported by nether portals or end portals.<ref name="MC-67"/>
**{{IN|bedrock}}, mounts cannot be teleported by [[End Gateway (block)|end gateway]].
*When a mount receives [[damage|falling damage]], all passengers also receive falling damage.
**{{IN|java}}, if a mount is immune to falling damage, the damage is not passed to passengers.
**{{IN|bedrock}}, even if a mount is immune to falling damage, the damage is still passed to passengers.

=== Controlling ===

==== By players ====
The movement of the following mounts are controlled by the '''player''' when being ridden by it:
*{{EntitySprite|Horse}} Saddled [[horse]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Skeleton Horse}} Saddled [[skeleton horse]]s {{only|java}} / Adult [[skeleton horse]]s {{only|bedrock}}
*{{EntitySprite|Zombie Horse}} Saddled [[zombie horse]]s 
*{{EntitySprite|Donkey}} Saddled [[donkey]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Mule}} Saddled [[mule]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Camel}} Saddled [[camel]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Camel Husk}} Saddled [[camel husk]]s 
*{{EntitySprite|Pig}} [[Pig]]s can be controlled by players holding a [[carrot on a stick]].
*{{EntitySprite|Strider}} Saddled{{only|java}} [[strider]]s can be controlled by players holding a [[warped fungus on a stick]].
*{{EntitySprite|Nautilus}} Saddled [[nautilus]]es 
*{{EntitySprite|Zombie Nautilus}} Saddled [[zombie nautilus]]es 
*{{EntitySprite|oak Boat}} [[Boat]]s
*{{EntitySprite|oak Boat with chest}} [[Boats with chests]]
*{{EntitySprite|Happy Ghast}} Harnessed [[Happy Ghast]]

{{IN|java}}, though {{EntityLink|minecart|text=minecarts}} on rails receive the input from its player passenger, they are '''not''' regarded as being controlled in game. {{IN|java}}, boats and boats with chest are regarded as being controlled by a '''[[armor stand]]''' when being ridden by it, but never move.

The following mounts have the ability of "jump charging". When players ride them, the experience bar on [[HUD]] will be replaced by jumping charging bar:
*{{EntitySprite|Horse}} Saddled [[horse]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Donkey}} Saddled [[donkey]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Mule}} Saddled [[mule]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Skeleton Horse}} Saddled [[skeleton horse]]s {{only|java}} / Adult [[skeleton horse]]s {{only|bedrock}}
*{{EntitySprite|Zombie Horse}} Saddled [[zombie horse]]s 

The following mounts have the ability of "dash charging". When players ride them, the experience bar on [[HUD]] will be replaced by dashing charging bar:
*{{EntitySprite|Camel}} Saddled [[camel]]s
*{{EntitySprite|Camel Husk}} Saddled [[camel husk]]s 
*{{EntitySprite|Nautilus}} Saddled [[nautilus]]es 
*{{EntitySprite|Zombie Nautilus}} Saddled [[zombie nautilus]]es 

When a player rides the following entities, pressing {{control|inventory}} opens the interaction interface of these creatures instead of the normal item bar interface:
*{{EntitySprite|Horse}} Tamed [[horse]]
*{{EntitySprite|Donkey}} Tamed [[donkey]]
*{{EntitySprite|Mule}} Tamed [[mule]]
*{{EntitySprite|Llama}} Tamed [[llama]]
*{{EntitySprite|Trader llama}} Tamed [[trader llama]]
*{{EntitySprite|Camel}} [[Camel]]
*{{EntitySprite|Camel Husk}} [[Camel husk]] 
*{{EntitySprite|Skeleton Horse}} Tamed [[skeleton horse]] {{only|je}}
*{{EntitySprite|zombie Horse}} Tamed [[zombie horse]] {{only|je}}
*{{EntityLink|id=oak boat with chest|Boat with chest}}

==== By mobs ====
{{IN|java}}, the movement of a mount is controlled by its passenger, if both the mount and the passenger are '''mobs (not players)'''. However, there are some exceptions:
*Mobs with their <code>NoAI</code> NBT being true cannot be controlled by any mob, though they can be controlled by players.
*Slimes and magma cubes cannot control any mob, which is controlled by entity type tag <code>non_controlling_rider</code>.

{{IN|bedrock}}, for most rideable mobs, when its mob passenger tries to chase and attack player or mobs, the passenger takes control, otherwise the mount controls movement. The following mobs are exceptions:
*{{EntityLink|Hoglin}}: cannot be controlled by mob passengers.
*{{EntityLink|Strider}}: cannot be controlled by mob passengers.
{{IN|bedrock}}, some AI goals are disabled if the entities is ridden by or riding an entity. For example {{in|bedrock}}, when a zombie rides a pig, the pig controls the movement when they are idle; but the pig cannot follow players holding a carrot even when the zombie is idle; the pig controls the movement when it is breeding and the zombie is idle; the zombie controls the movement when it targets a player even when the pig is breeding.  

When being controlled by its passenger, the mount uses its own walk speed. However, {{in|java}}, the speed modifier of its passenger's AI is applied. For example, spiders ridden by a chicken, a sheep, or a llama have different speeds when they follow a player holding seeds, wheat, or hay block, respectively, since the AIs of chickens, sheep, and llamas have different speed modifiers, while {{in|bedrock}}, the speed modifier (speed multiplier) for being controlled is defined for each entity type (by <code>[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/entityreference/examples/entitygoals/minecraftbehavior_mount_pathing minecraft:behavior.mount_pathing]</code> component).

==== Behavior ====
For an entity that is ridden by multiple passengers, only the front passenger has control over the mount. If a player and other entities ride it at the same time, the player becomes the front passenger.

{{IN|java}}, the passenger controlling its mount can be targeted with {{cmd|execute on controller}}.

{{IN|java}}, mobs cannot float on water when they are controlled; they are submerged in the water instead. {{IN|bedrock}}, they can float on water when being controlled; however, because they float up and down more fiercely than in {{el|java}}, their heads are often submerged so that the passenger is ejected, while tall mobs can float on water without their heads being submerged and the passenger is not ejected.

=== Dismounting ===
Mobs usually cannot leave their mounts on their own AI (there are some exceptions, e.g. {{in|java}}, baby piglins stop riding baby hoglins when being hurt), but there are many ways to make passengers leave their mounts:
*When the passenger is a player, the player uses the {{control|dismount}} control.
*When the passenger is a player, the player starts sleeping by using {{control|use}} on a bed.
*When the passenger is a player, the player starts riding another mount.
*When the mount is dead or destroyed.
*When the passenger starts being leashed with a [[lead]].
*When riding a chicken, pig, ravager, spider, strider, horse, donkey, mule, zombie horse, llama, trader llama or camel under [[water]], being driven off by them. {{IN|java}}, this is controlled by {{cd|dismounts_underwater}} entity [[tag]].<ref>{{bug|MC-72440|||WAI}}</ref>
*Being driven off by the mount (e.g. untamed horses, donkeys and llamas, underwater boats, minecarts on a powered [[activator rail]], etc.).
*{{IN|java}}, When the passenger finishes eating a [[chorus fruit]].
*{{IN|bedrock}}, when the passenger is pulled by a [[fishing rod]].
*{{IN|bedrock}}, when the passenger is a piglin, and it converts to a zombified piglin.
*When the passenger is teleported by {{cmd|tp}}.
*Dismounting by {{cmd|ride}} command.

=== Minecart ===
A mob can ride a [[minecart]] when pushing by a moving minecart on rails {{in|java}} or when colliding with a minecart {{in|bedrock}}. {{IN|bedrock}}, armor stands can also be picked up.

[[Ender dragon]]s, [[warden]]s, and [[wither]]s cannot be picked up by a minecart. {{IN|java}}, [[iron golem]]s cannot be picked up either.

{{IN|bedrock}}, unlike [[warden]]s, ender dragons can ride a minecart via the {{cmd|ride}} command; withers cannot ride a minecart via the {{cmd|ride}} even though a success message is returned.

=== Boat ===
Mobs can be picked up into a [[boat]] or a [[boat with chest]] when they collide with the side of the boat or boat with chest. {{IN|java}}, a boat being ridden by a player cannot pick up a mob. {{IN|bedrock}}, mobs can be picked up by a boat being ridden by a player.

Mobs wider than the width of a boat cannot be picked up. [[Warden]]s and [[wither]]s cannot be picked up.

{{IN|bedrock}}, mobs wider than the width of a boat can ride a boat via the {{cmd|ride}} command. Unlike wardens, ender dragons can ride a boat via {{cmd|ride}} command; withers cannot ride a boat via {{cmd|ride}} even though a success message is returned.

=== Jockey ===
{{main|Jockey}}

==== Spider jockey ====
{{main|Spider Jockey}}
Spider jockeys are the rare appearance of a spider being ridden by a [[skeleton]].

==== Chicken jockey ====
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
{{main|Chicken Jockey}}
Chicken jockeys are the rare appearance of a baby [[zombie]], baby [[zombified piglin]], baby [[zombie villager]], baby [[husk]], or baby [[drowned]] riding a [[chicken]].

==== Jockey of baby zombie ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, 15% naturally spawned baby zombies, zombie villagers{{upcoming|26.0}}, baby husks, baby drowned{{upcoming|26.0}}, and baby zombified piglins{{upcoming|26.0}} try to find a mount when it tries attacking a [[villager]], [[player]], or [[iron golem]], which can ride:
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s
* {{EntitySprite|Ocelot}} Untamed [[ocelot]]s

}}

==== Skeleton Horseman ====
{{main|Skeleton Horseman}}
Skeleton horseman is a jockey consisting of a [[skeleton]] riding a [[skeleton horse]]. Skeleton horsemen spawn only from a "skeleton trap horse".

=== Baby piglin riding baby hoglin ===
{{main|Piglin|Hoglin}}
Baby piglins play with baby hoglins, running around and riding upon them. Up to 3 baby piglins may stack on top of each other while riding a baby hoglin. {{IN|bedrock}}, a baby [[hoglin]] can support 3 baby piglins, which looks like they are stacked one by one. However, {{in|java}}, baby piglins ride each other and are indeed stacked one by one, instead of all riding on the hoglin.

=== Strider or zombified piglin riding strider ===
{{main|Strider|Zombified Piglin}}
For every strider that spawns, there is a 1 in 10 chance of an additional baby strider to spawn riding on top of the previous strider. Zombified piglins have a 1 in 30 chance of spawning on top of a strider.

=== Illager riding ravager ===
{{main|Ravager}}
A [[ravager]] generated in [[raids]] may generate with a [[pillager]], [[evoker]] or [[vindicator]] riding on it.

=== Parrot riding player ===
{{main|Parrot}}
A tamed parrot on the ground can be made to perch on its player's shoulder by moving through the parrot. {{IN|bedrock}}, technically the parrot is riding the player. {{IN|java}}, technically the parrot on the shoulder is not an entity.

== Valid riding combinations in vanilla ==
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, whether an entity is rideable is mainly defined with minecraft:rideable component and entity [[family|familliers]] in vanilla behavior packs. Some entities have hardcoded riding behaviors. For example, wardens cannot ride in a boat, and boats cannot pick up adult horses, although adult horses can ride in boats via the {{cmd|ride}} command.

In the following table, <code>none</code> means that the entity is rideable by these families no matter what component groups it has. Multiple components separated by | symbols means that the entity must have at least one of them to be rideable by these families.
