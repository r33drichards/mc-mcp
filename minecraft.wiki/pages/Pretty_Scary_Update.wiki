The '''Pretty Scary Update''' is the name for {{el|je}} [[Java Edition 1.4.2|1.4.2]], a major update officially released on October 25, 2012.<ref name="AnimalSufficationBug">{{tweet|jeb|260659871219843072|We found the animal suffocation bug!!!11oneone Unfortunately that means a 1.4.1, and aim for Thursday morning instead of Wednesday afternoon|October 23, 2012}}</ref> Among the main changes were a number of new [[mob]]s and variants ([[witch]]es, [[bat]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s), wearable and placeable [[head]]s, a new boss (the [[wither]]), the [[command block]], the [[anvil]], the [[beacon]], new [[food]] ([[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s and [[pumpkin pie]]s), [[Carrot on a Stick|carrots on sticks]] for controlling pigs, the [[Nether star]], and new decoration items (such as [[item frame]]s, [[flower pot]]s and [[Wall|cobblestone walls]]).

The official name of the update was revealed at PAX Prime 2012 during the ''Minecraft'' panel, then later with snapshot {{verlink|Java Edition 12w36a|12w36a}}.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/09/minecraft-snapshot-12w36a/</ref> [[Dinnerbone]] first revealed the 1.4 release date with snapshot {{verlink|Java Edition 12w40a|12w40a}}, where he stated that he was fully into the "Prepare for release" mode.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/10/minecraft-snapshot-12w40a/</ref>

Development on the Pretty Scary Update began the week after {{verlink|JE 1.3.1|1.3.1}}, which was released on August 1, 2012. 15 development snapshots for 1.4 from {{verlink|Java Edition 12w32a|12w32a}} to {{verlink|Java Edition 12w42b|12w42b}} were released. During the development period, 1.3.2 was released. The 1.4 Pre-release was unveiled on October 19, 2012, so that modders could start preparing their mods before the launch on October 24, 2012.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/10/minecraft-snapshot-12w42b-preprerelease/</ref> 

[[Mojang]] found a mob suffocation bug after this was released, and was forced to delay the launch by a day. The 1.4.1 Prerelease was unveiled on October 23, 2012,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/10/minecraft-1-4-1-pre-release/</ref> and the release was pushed back a day. 

Mojang then found yet another bug, and fixed "a severe memory leak in the server". This, as well as correct rendering of [[fence]]s and cobblestone [[stairs]], came in the 1.4.2 Prerelease, released on October 24, 2012.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.mojang.com/2012/10/minecraft-1-4-2-pre-release/</ref> 1.4.2 was the first official release of 1.4, available through the launcher on October 25, 2012.

A bug was introduced whereby a player could not achieve the ''The End?'' achievement.

The Pretty Scary Update was originally intended to include the [[Modding API]], however it was pushed to a later version.<ref>{{tweet|jeb|246177156193980416|Yes, eventually|September 13, 2012}}</ref>

Lighting bugs present in 1.3.2 were partially fixed. Dinnerbone first introduced changes in snapshots {{verlink|Java Edition 12w39b|12w39a/b}}. Dinnerbone tweeted to revert and push this to 1.5.<ref name="Lighting Fix 1.5">{{tweet|dinnerbone|251719813704069120|I think I'm going to revert the new lighting stuff and come back to it for 1.5. I'd rather get other (actually working) bugfixes in 1.4.|September 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|253772962530996224|Lighting is really annoying me now. Reverting everything I've done to it, will come back to it in 1.5 : (|October 4, 2012}}</ref><br /> Other changes postponed to 1.5 include redstone changes<ref>{{tweet|jeb|253778582369861632|The redstone changes we did yesterday will not be in 1.4. We fixed incorrect behaviours, but those behaviours are used in many contraptions|October 4, 2012}}</ref> and a rendering overhaul.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|252679131261710336|Looks like we can keep the lighting code; Managed to selectively revert the worldgen portion.
