[[File:Spectator mode.png|thumb|Spectator mode.]]

'''Spectator mode''' is a [[game mode]] that allows the [[player]] to [[fly]] around and observe the [[world]] without interacting with it in any way.

== Usage ==
Spectators are invisible to other [[player]]s and [[mob]]s, can [[fly]], clip through [[block]]s and [[entities]], and view all entities, including other players, in Spectator mode. The [[HUD]] is completely invisible, except for [[subtitle]]s and the [[chat]]. The [[inventory]] is accessible in Spectator mode; however, it cannot be interacted with in any way, and items cannot be [[craft]]ed in the crafting grid.

=== Accessing ===
Spectator mode can be entered by using the {{cmd|gamemode spectator}} [[command]], dying in [[Hardcore]] mode, using {{key|F3+N}} with [[cheats]] enabled, or through the {{key|F3+F4}} game mode selector.

{{IN|be}} and [[Minecraft Education|''Minecraft Education'']], Spectator mode can also be entered by changing the personal game mode to Spectator through settings, although players cannot spectate other entities.

=== Invisibility ===
Spectators are not noticed by [[mob]]s, and do not trigger [[mob spawning]] (including from [[monster spawner]]s), nor do they prevent mob despawning, but they are noticed by commands and/or [[command block]]s.

Spectators who are affected by the [[Glowing]] [[status effect]] can still be seen in Spectator mode by other players, although not by mobs.

=== Highlighting players ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
Spectators can also use the "Highlight Players (Spectator)" [[control]] if changed from the default (unassigned). This allows the spectator to see other [[player]]s as if they have the Glowing effect when the button is pressed; the effect disappears when the button is released. The color of the outline reflects the player's [[team]].

=== Intangibility ===
Spectators can move through blocks, entities and other players. When their head is inside a block, they can see through all blocks.

Spectators can see through [[lava]] and [[powder snow]], and their underwater vision is set to maximum instantly instead of gradually like in other game modes.

Spectators cannot take [[damage]], as all blows go through them. [[Lava]], [[drowning]], [[fire]], and [[suffocation]] also do not affect them. However, they can still take damage from the [[void]]{{only|je}} or the {{cmd|kill}} command.

Commands (including player selectors) can still target spectators.

=== Flight ===
Spectators are always flying. They cannot stop flying by landing, as the player just clips through the blocks. The mouse scroll wheel and the [[sprint]] key affect the flying speed, but the [[slowness]] and [[swiftness]] effects do not.

The maximum speed that can be achieved while flying is 43.556&nbsp;m/s (156.80&nbsp;km/h) without sprinting and 87.111&nbsp;m/s (313.59&nbsp;km/h) if sprinting.

=== GUIs ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
If a player opens their [[inventory]] while in Spectator mode, they cannot interact with or use any of the [[item]]s in it. Likewise, viewing GUIs is possible, but it is not possible to interact with them. If a container uses a [[loot table]] to generate its contents, but the loot has not yet been generated, a player in Spectator mode cannot open the container to view its contents. Items in the world also cannot be picked up. The player's head is slightly visible in the inventory, but in a translucent, darker color.

If a number key is pressed, the player can teleport to a specific player on that server by pressing {{key|1}}, or the player can teleport to a team member by pressing {{key|2}} and clicking on the number of the player twice to be teleported or once to see their name. There are also specific buttons on the [[hotbar]] {{in|je}}. However, these icons use older textures.

=== Seeing invisible entities ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
Spectators can see other spectators and invisible [[mob]]s, as well as themselves using {{key|F5}}. Spectators appear as a translucent disembodied head, and any held or equipped items are invisible. Invisible mobs appear translucent, like when viewing an invisible ally with {{cmd|team modify <''team''> seeFriendlyInvisibles}} set to true.

=== Mob view ===
{{Exclusive|Java|section=1}}
A spectator can click on an entity with the attack button, to take its view. Their position is locked to that of the entity, and their POV moves in accordance with the entity. Viewing oneself while spectating from an entity's point-of-view using {{key|F5}} shows the entity. Pressing the dismount key ({{key|Shift}} by default) returns the player to flying mode. In addition to spectating mobs, players can also spectate any other entity, such as an [[end crystal]], [[primed TNT]], or an [[armor stand]]. If the spectating mob takes any form of [[damage]], the screen tilts a little as if the player was taking damage. 

Certain mobs also apply a post-processing [[shader]] while looking from their point of view. This filters how the world is portrayed to the spectator. Similar to the [[Super Secret Settings]], if one presses {{key|F4}}, it removes the filter without dismounting the mob. Below is a table of mobs that have a filter. [[Warden]]s, despite supposedly being blind and having no visible eyes, show a normal view when spectated.<ref>{{bug|MC-249500|||WAI}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*If the player wears a [[pumpkin]] on their head and enters Spectator mode, their vision is still filtered, even when spectating a mob.
* If an entity falls out of the world, any spectators die with it as they are still separate entities, and take void damage.
* All mobs' perspectives can be viewed with the exception of the [[ender dragon]].
*Shaders persist if the player dies while spectating.
*If a player has an effect applied that [[Screen effects|changes their field of view]], players spectating them are also affected. The FOV changes are not visible when spectating non-players. 
**[[Nausea]] is not subject to this.
*If a player uses a [[spyglass]], the effect also applies to the spectator, but without the overlay.
*If a player presses a number key to open up their hotbar, it is revealed that the textures used for the icons are the older textures used before [[Java Edition 1.14]], even without the built-in [[Programmer Art]] texture pack enabled.
*If a player is in spectator mode, their name is italicized and grayed out on the multiplayer player list.
