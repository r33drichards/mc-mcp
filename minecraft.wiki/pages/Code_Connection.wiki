'''''Code Connection for Minecraft''''' is an extension that allows educators and students to explore, create, and play in an immersive ''Minecraft'' world – all by writing code.

== ''Code Connection'' ==
{{discontinued|section=1|The ''Code Connection'' app was discontinued on December 1, 2023. You can still use Code Builder or CodeConnectFix to code in Minecraft.<ref>{{cite|url=https://makecode.com/blog/minecraft/2023-release#code-connection-end-of-support|title=Code Connection end-of-support}}</ref>}}

=== Connection ===
''Code Connection'' launches in a separate window. From here the user can select an environment.

=== Supported editors ===
* [https://code.org Code.org]
* [https://minecraft.makecode.com Microsoft MakeCode]
* [https://tynker.com/minecraft/learn-to-code Tynker]
* [https://scratchfoundation.github.io/scratchx ScratchX]
* Other supported editors{{verify|which ones?}}

Once a editor is selected, paste the <code>/connect</code> command into the chat. You can then return to ''[[Bedrock Edition|Minecraft]]'' and you'll be greeted by the [[Agent]], who can be programmed to perform all sorts of activities in-game, from mining to building to farming.

Code Connection was officially discontinued on December 1, 2023, however, if you head to the Minecraft Tynker website and create a mod, you will still be able to link it up to the game.

== Code Builder ==
