'''shulker_boxes.png-atlas''' is a procedurally-generated [[texture atlas]] used to store textures for all [[shulker box]]es.

[[Shulker]]s themselves do not reference this atlas, nor do their bullets. Notably, this means that while shulker boxes can be animated like many other textures, doing so will cause shulkers to appear completely broken in-game.<ref>{{bug|MC-196524}}</ref>

== Format ==
<samp>shulker_boxes.png-atlas</samp> is a fixed-width 512×256-pixel file that store textures for all shulkers and shulker boxes.

|{{HistoryLine||1.19.3|dev=22w42a|As an optimization to resource pack loading, everything in the relevant directory is compiled into this atlas, rather than only those sprites which are used by the game.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=22w46a|A customizable atlas json file has been added which can be used to control which graphics are added to this atlas.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.19.4|dev=Pre-release 3|The way in which sprites are arranged on atlases has been changed considerably, resulting in atlas dimensions being generally smaller.
|This atlas can now be exported to the screenshots folder using F3+S.}}

| All textures now have an extra pixel of padding in all four directions. This negatively impacts tiling efficiency.<ref>{{bug|MC-303675}}</ref>

==== Mipmapped versions ====
Minecraft also generates mipmapped versions of this atlas, for unknown reasons. They are not used by the game at all - only blocks placed in the world which use the json model system use mipmapped textures.<ref>{{bug|MC-277450}}</ref> The mipmapped version no longer generates in [[1.21.9]].
