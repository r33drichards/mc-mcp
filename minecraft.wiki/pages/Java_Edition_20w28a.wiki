'''20w28a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16.2]], released on July 8, 2020,<ref name="20w28a">{{snap|20w28a|July 8, 2020}}</ref> which adds experimental support for custom [[biome]]s and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>base_stone_nether</code> block tag.
** Contains netherrack, basalt, and blackstone.
** Used to determine what blocks [[ancient debris]] can replace.
* Added the <code>base_stone_overworld</code> block tag.
** Contains stone, granite, diorite, and andesite.
** Used to determine what blocks dirt, gravel, granite, diorite, andesite, coal ore, iron ore, gold ore, redstone ore, diamond ore, lapis lazuli ore, and infested stone can replace when generated as underground ores.
* Added the <code>stone_crafting_materials</code> item tag.
** Contains cobblestone and blackstone.
** Used in the {{mono|furnace.json}} advancement and recipe files.
** Used in the {{mono|brewing_stand.json}} recipe file.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Brewing stand]]s'''
* Can now be crafted with [[blackstone]].
** Determined by the <code>stone_crafting_materials</code> item tag.

'''[[End portal (block)|End portals]]'''
* Now teleport the player centered on the end platform instead of at the north-west corner of the block.

'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* The crafting recipe and recipe book unlock now use the <code>stone_crafting_materials</code> item tag.
** This change is not noticeable in-game as this tag has the same contents as the old <code>furnace_materials</code> item tag.

'''[[Potted cactus]]'''
* Model now uses a cullface for the top.
* No longer has a hole in the bottom: [[File:Potted Cactus UNKVER4 (facing NWU).png|32px]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Totem of undying]]'''
* Now gives [[Fire Resistance]] II for 40 seconds when activated.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now emit green particles when joining a [[village]], setting a home [[bed]], or acquiring a job site or profession to match {{BE}}.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Bartering]]'''
* Various weights and item amounts have been changed.
* [[Blackstone]], [[spectral arrow]]s, and [[water bottle]]s can now be obtained through bartering.
* [[Glowstone dust]] and [[magma cream]] can no longer be obtained from bartering.

=== General ===
'''[[Custom]]'''
* Custom worlds now support custom [[biome]]s.

'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* There is now experimental support for a <code>[[Custom world generation|worldgen]]</code> folder in data packs.
** <code>worldgen/biome</code> can contain biome definitions.
** <code>worldgen/configured_carver</code> can contain definitions for world carver settings.
** <code>worldgen/configured_feature</code> can contain definitions for feature placements.
** <code>worldgen/configured_structure_feature</code> can contain definitions for structure placements.
** <code>worldgen/configured_surface_builder</code> can contain definitions for surfaces.
** <code>worldgen/processor_list</code> can contain sets of block processors.
** <code>worldgen/template_pool</code> can contain pool definitions for jigsaw structures.
* Custom biomes can now be used in the single biome/caves/floating islands [[world type]]s after adding the data pack containing the biome first.
* Custom biomes can now be used in custom [[dimension]] generators.

'''[[Java Edition distance effects|Distance effects]]'''
* Blobs no longer use 32-bit floats, causing them to generate in the correct shape regardless of position in the world and preventing a crash that could occur if the world border was moved out further via mods.

'''GPU warnlist'''
* Changed to no longer explicitly warn against Mesa and Gallium renderers and X.Org vendors, but instead just warn against anything with a version below 3.0.

'''[[Server]]s'''
* Dedicated servers can now rate limit clients.
** Dedicated servers can now kick clients that consistently send too many packets within a second.
** Controlled with the <code>rate-limit</code> settings in <code>[[server.properties]]</code>.
** The default rate limit of 0 means "no limit".

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Changed the <code>furnace_materials</code> item tag to <code>stone_crafting_materials</code>.

'''World creation'''
* Changed the description of the <code>doDaylightCycle</code> [[Commands/gamerule|gamerule]] from "Advance in-game time" to "Advance time of day".
