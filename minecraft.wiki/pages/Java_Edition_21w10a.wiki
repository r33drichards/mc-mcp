'''21w10a''' is the thirteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on March 10, 2021,<ref>{{snap|21w10a|March 10, 2021}}</ref> which adds [[lush caves]] and new [[deepslate]] variants.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Cracked Deepslate Bricks JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Cracked deepslate bricks]]'''
* A cracked variation of [[deepslate bricks]].
* Obtained by smelting deepslate bricks.

'''[[File:Cracked Deepslate Tiles JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Cracked deepslate tiles]]'''
* A cracked variation of [[deepslate tiles]].
* Obtained by smelting deepslate tiles.

'''{{Animate|Deepslate Coal Ore JE1 BE2.png; Deepslate Copper Ore JE2 BE2.png; Deepslate Emerald Ore JE1 BE1.png|32px}} Deepslate ores'''
* Added deepslate ore variants for [[Copper Ore|copper]], [[Emerald Ore|emerald]] and [[Coal Ore|coal ore]].
** Do not generate by default; they only have been added for use by creators of maps and data packs.
** Like other deepslate ores, they can be used in blasting and smelting recipes like normal ores.
*** Again, like other deepslate ores, they unlock these recipes in the recipe book.

'''[[File:Deepslate.png|32px]] [[Infested deepslate]]'''
* An infested variant of deepslate.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Azalea Tree.png|32px]] [[Azalea tree]]'''
* Generate above [[lush caves]], either on the surface or underground.
* Consist of [[azalea leaves]] (both variants), [[oak log]]s and [[rooted dirt]].

'''{{BiomeLink|Lush caves}}'''
* Currently the biome is only accessible in single-biome worlds.
* Adaptive to the environment: every type of cave generation can be a lush cave.
* [[Moss block]]s cover the floors and ceilings, along with [[moss carpet]]s and [[grass]] on the floors.
* [[Spore blossom]]s grow from the ceiling and drip particles.
* Contains [[clay]] pools where [[dripleaf]] plants grow out of them.
** Clay pools sometimes generate [[water]] sources over [[air]], and the water is suspended and does not flow. This has yet to be fixed.
* Contains [[azalea]] bushes (both variants).
* [[Cave vines]] with [[glow berries]] grow from the ceiling and light up the caves.

=== General ===
'''[[Shaders]]'''
* Are now included for all supported render states.
* Any shader except for the blitting shader can also be replaced in resource packs.
* For now replacing these shaders is not officially supported and the way it works may change in the future.
* Current rendering engine uses a system similar to the post-processing shader pipeline. There are some differences between both systems that cater to slightly different requirements.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the {{cd|coal_ores|copper_ores|emerald_ores|d=and}} block and item tags.
** Contain both the normal and deepslate ores of each ore type.
* Added the <code>lush_ground_replaceable</code> block tag.
** Contains the <code>[[Tag#blocks lush_plants_replaceable|#lush_plants_replaceable]]</code> block tag, clay, and moss block.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Deepslate diamond ore]], [[deepslate gold ore]], [[deepslate iron ore]], [[deepslate lapis lazuli ore]], [[deepslate redstone ore]], [[coal ore]], [[diamond ore]], [[iron ore]], [[gold ore]]'''
* The textures of these ores have been changed.
** Iron ore and deepslate iron ore no longer have streaks, better matching the appearance of other ores.
** Diamond ore closer resembles deepslate diamond ore.

'''[[Cobbled deepslate]]'''
* The texture has been changed.
* Can now be smelted back into deepslate.

'''[[Deepslate]]'''
* Both the top and side textures have been changed.
* Deepslate can now be placed along any axis.
* Textures in caves now generate with a random rotation.

'''[[Deepslate bricks]] and [[deepslate tiles]]'''
* Can now be crafted.

'''[[Lava]]'''
* Now replaces air below Y=-53.

'''[[Lightning rod]]'''
* Changelog states they can now be waterlogged, though this is not the case.<!-- If it's not the case then why is it mentioned here?-->

'''[[Moss block]]'''
* Using [[bone meal]] on it now spreads moss to blocks on any height.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spyglass]]'''
* The item model has been changed back to a dedicated texture.
** Similar to [[trident]]s, the spyglass still uses a 3d model in the hand.
** The texture is different from the original item texture.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Slime]]'''
* The maximum size that slimes can be summoned with is now 128.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Crack carver]]s'''
* Now are much less common.

'''[[Fossil]]s'''
* The fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with deepslate diamond ore instead of coal ore.

[[File:21w10a approximate ore distribution.jpg|thumb|400px|The new ore generation for 21w10a.]]
'''Ore distribution'''
* Now generates more [[emerald ore]] in mountains.
* Now generates more [[lapis lazuli ore]].
* Now generates less [[copper ore]], [[gold ore]], and [[redstone ore]].
* Now generates smaller [[diamond ore]] blobs, but slightly more frequent (less diamond ore overall though).
* Now generates less [[iron ore]], and it generates lower down.
** The deepest iron generation range: previously Y=-64 to -8, now Y=-64 to -32.
** The middle iron generation range: previously Y=-16 to 80 (most at 32), now Y=-24 to 56 (most at 16).
* Reduced air exposure for [[coal ore]].

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|/give}}'''
* The give command can only give up to 100 stacks of items at a time (e.g. 6400 stone or 100 iron swords)

'''{{cmd|/spawnpoint}}'''
* Can no longer set a player's spawnpoint to areas that are out of the world.

=== Gameplay ===
'''{{EffectLink|Glowing}}'''
* Glowing is now based on the outline of all layers on an entity, not just the base layer.

=== General ===
'''Game library updates'''
* Rendering is now using OpenGL 3.2 core profile.
** All fixed function rendering has been replaced with shader-based rendering.

'''[[Splashes]]'''
* Changed the splash "OpenGL 2.1 (if supported)!" to "Now on OpenGL 3.2 core profile!"

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Glow item frames have their own subtitles, no longer using the same subtitles as normal item frames.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed moss block, the <code>[[Tag#blocks flowers|#flowers]]</code> block tag, grass, tall grass, moss carpet, small dripleaf, big dripleaf, big dripleaf stem, and vines from the <code>lush_plants_replaceable</code> block tag.
* Removed the <code>azalea_log_replaceable</code> block tag.
