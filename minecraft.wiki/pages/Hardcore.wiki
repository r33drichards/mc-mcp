'''Hardcore''' is a variant of [[Survival]] and one of the main [[game mode]]s in ''Minecraft''. In this mode, the world is locked to Hard [[difficulty]] and the [[player]] is unable to respawn after dying.

The key feature of Hardcore mode is that the player is not given the option to [[respawn]] upon [[death]] as they would in other game modes. Instead, the player is given two options: to spectate the world, which sets the player's game mode to [[Spectator]] mode and respawns them at the world's spawn point, or return back to the [[title screen]]. Re-opening the world after death simply returns to the same death screen or the Spectator mode depending on the outcome.

In addition, Hardcore mode worlds are restricted to Hard [[difficulty]] and cannot be changed, being the second key feature.

When creating a Hardcore mode world, the ''Allow [[Command]]s'', ''[[Starting map|Starting Map]]'',{{only|bedrock}} and ''[[Bonus Chest]]'' world options are locked and disabled. On the world selection menu, Hardcore mode worlds display dark red text reading "Hardcore Mode"

Hardcore mode is specific to worlds, not players; the variable determining whether the world is in Hardcore mode is saved in <code>[[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]]</code>. Thus, the player can use {{cmd|gamemode creative}} (if commands are enabled) to set themselves to [[Creative]] mode. Players in Creative mode while on a Hardcore mode world still see Hardcore mode's death screen upon death.

It is normally impossible to toggle Hardcore mode once the world has been created, though it is possible to use external programs such as [[Tutorial:Programs and editors/NBTExplorer|NBTExplorer]] to change it by setting the {{nbt|bool|hardcore}} tag to either 1 (hardcore) or 0 (normal).

However, it is possible to enable commands through the [[Open to LAN]] feature in the [[pause menu]].{{only|java}} From here, the player can, while spectating the world after death, type {{cmd|gamemode survival}} to bring themselves back to [[Survival]] mode, being able to play again by cheating death.

It is also possible to enable "Immediate Respawn" in Hardcore mode, allowing a player to skip the death screen and automatically switch to Spectator mode.

== Multiplayer ==
Hardcore mode is an option for [[multiplayer]], and its functions are similar to those in [[singleplayer]]. All players have Hardcore mode enabled — it is impossible to have some players in Hardcore and some not.
[[Server]] operators can use the {{cmd|gamemode}} command to change the game mode of themselves or another player.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2|Hardcore mode added. Upon death, the "Delete world" button and "You cannot respawn in hardcore mode!"<sup>{{sic}}</sup> text are shown, and the difficulty in the options menu appears as "Hardcore".}}

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w18a|Hardcore mode is now properly supported in multiplayer. Previously, running a hardcore mode world on a server would force the difficulty to Hard, but players could still respawn as normal and the HUD displayed regular hearts.
|When the player dies in hardcore mode on a server, the "Delete world" button is replaced by "Leave server", which automatically bans the player from the server when clicked.
|Deleting the world/leaving the server after dying in hardcore mode now displays the message "You have died. Game over, man, it's game over!"}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=12w21a|Multiplayer death bans now specify the reason "Death in Hardcore", shown when attempting to rejoin.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.7.2|dev=13w36a|Clicking the delete world/leave server button now displays a prompt asking if the player wants to quit to the title screen or respawn, as a result of the same prompt being added to the regular death screen. Choosing to "respawn" deletes the world/bans the player as normal, while "title screen" quits without doing anything special.<ref>{{bug|MC-10979}}</ref>}}

|{{HistoryLine||1.8.1|dev=pre1|Hardcore worlds can no longer be uploaded to [[Realms]], as the auto-banning on death would cause the host to be permanently locked out of the realm until resetting it or restoring a backup.<ref>MC-71981</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.8.3|The delete world/leave server button no longer shows the quit confirmation - instead, it opens the main menu screen but leaves the world/server loaded in the background without deleting it/banning the player.<ref>{{bug|MC-30646}}</ref>
|As a result, the ability for hardcore mode to automatically delete worlds/ban players and the "Game over, man" message are effectively removed from this point forward, although the button labels have not yet been changed to reflect this.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.9|dev=15w37a|The player now has the option to be put into [[Spectator]] mode on death instead of attempting to delete the world (which remains broken).
|Removed the text "You cannot respawn in hardcore mode!" from the death screen.<ref>{{bug|MC-121007||"You cannot respawn in hardcore mode!" message no longer appears as of version 1.9|WAI}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.15|dev=19w35a|The "Delete world"/"Leave server" button on the Hardcore death screen has been changed to "Title screen" and no longer leaves the world loaded in the background, officially removing the option to delete the world/ban the player on death.}}

== Trivia ==
[[File:1DNGn.png|thumb|The joke "ultra hardcore" button.]]
* When Hardcore mode was announced, Notch jokingly posted an image of an 'ultra hardcore' mode where the premium status of the player's account would be revoked on death.<ref>{{tweet|notch|117188911230500864|http://i.imgur.com/1DNGn.png|September 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>[https://imgur.com/ultra-hardcore-mode-1DNGn "Ultra hardcore mode!"]</ref> This is not to be confused with [[Ultra Hardcore|the custom game mode of the same name]].
* When toggling Hardcore mode on ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', the sounds of a [[flint and steel]] igniting and a [[zombie]] infecting a [[villager]] are played.
* The longest Hardcore world record lasted for 5 years. It ended in April 2019 when a baby [[zombie]] and a [[spider]] killed the record holder in a cave. A [[splash]] text called "''[[w:Philza|Ph1lza]] had a good run!''" was added in reference of him.<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-minecrafter--a-hardcore-tragedy|Meet a Minecrafter: A Hardcore Tragedy|July 27, 2019|Kelsey Howard}}</ref>
* When a Hardcore mode world is loaded on a version released prior to Hardcore mode, the world is permanently converted into a Survival world.
