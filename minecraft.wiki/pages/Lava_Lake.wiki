A '''lava lake''' is a small, widespread, naturally-generated [[feature]] in the [[Overworld]] that contains a volume of [[lava]].

== Description ==
Lava lakes are shallow and often small bodies of liquid. Lava lakes found at the surface are surrounded by [[stone]], which can be replaced by other features such as [[ore feature]]s of blocks. These ore features are made of blocks like [[dirt]], [[gravel]], and [[coal ore]].

Lava lakes generate with a small [[air]] pocket above them, which may result in floating [[sand]], floating [[snow]] cover, or even floating [[tree]]s above<ref>{{bug|MC-225839}}</ref>. Lava lakes that spawn on ground level may cause nearby trees to catch on [[fire]] and burn away.

== Generation ==
Lava lakes are rare on the surface but often found underground above Y=0, and replace blocks around them with stone. They can generate in any biomes in Overworld except the [[deep dark]].

{{IN|java}}, the air pockets above lakes are generated with [[cave air]] instead of normal air. This is true even for lakes that are exposed to the open sky.

=== Config ===

{{main|Configured feature}}
{{el|java}}:
<section begin="config"/><div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound|config}}
** {{nbt|compound|fluid}} The block to use for the fluid of the lake.
*** {{nbt inherit/block state provider}}
** {{nbt|compound|barrier}} The block to use for the barrier of the lake. If 'air' is specified, the barrier remains unchanged instead of overwriting any existing blocks.
*** {{nbt inherit/block state provider}}
</div><section end="config"/>

Note that lake features are generated on their northwest corner, with the actual center of the lake being offset from the placement position by +8 blocks on both the X and Z axes. It's recommended to counteract this by applying an [[Placed feature#:~:text=noise based count|xz_spread offset]] of -8 blocks to placed lake features before performing any additional checks such as block predicate filters.

Lake features require a sufficient amount of solid blocks in order to generate, including (but not limited to) a solid base at least 3 blocks thick (starting from one block below the placement position). The fluid level of generated lake features is always one block below the placement position.

Noise-type blockstate providers apply a single blockstate for the entire lake based on its placement position rather than the position of the lake's individual constituent blocks.

Lake features exhibit a bug in which the [[freeze top layer]] feature type is applied only to portions of the lake that are within the chunk from which the lake feature originates. In effect, this means that usually only the north-west corner of water lakes are iced over in snowy biomes.
