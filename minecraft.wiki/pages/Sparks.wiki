== Powers and abilities ==
Sparks is consistently shown to be incredibly intelligent, with skills ranging from construction to quantum entanglement. Using her qualifications, she has been able to create impressive inventions, including ones capable of the destruction of the universe.

== Biography ==
At an unknown time, Sparks created [[the Togetherness Machine]], intended to bring about a merger of different consoles that play ''[[Minecraft]]''. Using the combined energies of [[charged creepers]], she took a massive gamble, risking her own existence being destroyed. Nonetheless, she pushed forward, sending an excavator out to unite the platforms. This paid off, with dozens of heroes now together building in a circular biome.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|All Sparks wants to do is make things. She’s a builder, an architect, a [[redstone]] expert... and five times more enthusiastic about everything than it’s healthy to be. Sparks loves stuff! She loves her friends! She loves animals! She loves exclamation marks! Craft [[planks]] for Sparks and she’ll swear they’re the best planks she’s ever seen, and that you’re her best friend and, oh, they’re just what she wanted and, gosh, she’s not going to cry. Sniff, she’s really not. The only thing Sparks doesn’t love is the dark and groaning beasts that live in the shadows. Which is why the thing she loves most is building impenetrable fortresses surrounded by traps. She loves [[lava]] rooms! They’re so colourful and burny!|[[Marsh Davies]]<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-mags-colourful-characters|Meet the Mag’s Colourful Characters|August 11, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>|image=Marsh Davies Mojang avatar.png}}
