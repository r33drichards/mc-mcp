'''1.18.2 Pre-release 1''' (known as '''1.18.2-pre1''' in the launcher) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.18.2]], released on February 18, 2022,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-18-2-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.18.2 Pre-Release 1|February 18, 2022}}</ref> which improves [[structure]] related [[tag]]s and [[commands]], updates [[data pack]]s, and fixes bugs. This is the first pre-release released in 2022.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added following configured structure feature tags:
** {{cd|#dolphin_located}}: {{cd|d=and|#ocean_ruin|#shipwreck}}.
** {{cd|#eye_of_ender_located}}: {{cd|stronghold}}.
** {{cd|#mineshaft}}: {{cd|d=and|mineshaft|mineshaft_mesa}}.
** {{cd|#ocean_ruin}}: {{cd|d=and|ocean_ruin_cold|ocean_ruin_warm}}.
** {{cd|#on_ocean_explorer_maps}}: {{cd|monument}}.
** {{cd|#on_treasure_maps}}: {{cd|buried_treasure}}.
** {{cd|#on_woodland_explorer_maps}}: {{cd|mansion}}.
** {{cd|#ruined_portal}}: {{cd|d=and|ruined_portal|ruined_portal_desert|ruined_portal_jungle|ruined_portal_mountain|ruined_portal_nether|ruined_portal_ocean|ruined_portal_swamp}}.
** {{cd|#shipwreck}}: {{cd|d=and|shipwreck|shipwreck_beached}}.
** {{cd|#village}}: {{cd|d=and|village|village_desert|village_plains|village_savanna|village_snowy|village_taiga}}.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Dolphin]]s'''
* Now pick the closest [[structure]] more accurately, regardless of structure type.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Bastion remnant]]'''
* Bounding boxes are now slightly more accurate to the shape of the structure.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Now support [[tag]]s, using {{cd|#}} prefix to distinguish from normal IDs.
* The parameter is now a configured structure rather than a structure type.
** For instance, it is now possible to use {{cmd|locate village_desert}} or {{cmd|locate shipwreck_beached}}.
* The old usage for structure categories is now done via tags.
** For instance, {{cmd|locate village}} is now {{cmd|locate #village}}.

'''{{cmd|locatebiome}}'''
* Now support tags, using {{cd|#}} prefix to distinguish from normal IDs.
** For instance, it is now possibile to use {{cmd|locatebiome #minecraft:has_structure/igloo}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Increased data pack version from <code>8</code> to <code>9</code>.
* It is now possible to add custom structures in experimental datapacks: the game now generates and stores data-driven configured structures.
** Experimental datapacks can add new structure sets.
** The {{cd|feature}} field in location predicates now references a configured feature.
** The {{cd|exploration_map}} loot table function {{cd|destination}} field is now a configured feature tag id.
** The {{cd|exploration_map}} loot table function no longer automatically sets the display name of the map.
* A lot of the cave generation is now configurable through data packs.
** A new registry was added for Density functions (caves are created by combining those together).
** Noise settings got a new field {{cd|noise_router}} (and lost a couple of flags), see {{samp|worldgen/noise_settings}} folder in the worldgen report.
** Noise router wires data-driven parts of the cave generation with the rest of the code.

'''General'''
* Added a warning for users running Minecraft in a 32-bit environment in the main menu, because support for the 32-bit environment will end soon.
