'''1.10''' is a [[Java Edition Classic]] server version released for [[Classic 0.30 (Creative)|0.30 (Creative)]] on December 11, 2009.

== Additions ==
* A warning was added for turning <code>verify-names</code> in [[server.properties]] off.
** The warning reads:
<pre style="width: 70ex">
######################### WARNING #########################
verify-names is set to false! This means that anyone who
connects to this server can choose any username he or she
wants! This includes impersonating an OP!

AND SINCE THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVER, IT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU!

If you wish to fix this, edit server.properties, and change
verify-names to true.
###########################################################
</pre>

* Added <code>admin-slot</code> to [[server.properties]].
** Setting this to true prevents players from logging in if the server is almost full and they're not admins.

== Fixes ==
* Tried to fix <code>grow-trees</code>.
* Fixed a bug where people with long usernames could connect.
