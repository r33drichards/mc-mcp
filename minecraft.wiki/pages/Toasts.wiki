'''Toasts''' are informational text boxes shown on [[heads-up display]]. They typically show up when the player unlocks new [[Recipe|crafting recipes]], grants [[Advancement|advancements]], a [[song]] starts playing, or loads up a new [[world]].

[[Tutorial hints]] are also specific toasts that serve to teach the player how to play the game.

== Description ==
[[File:Toast Recipe Java Edition.png|thumb|A toast in ''Java Edition''.]]

{{IN|je}}, toasts are shown when the player unlocks crafting and smelting recipes, by showing an icon of a [[furnace]] or of a [[crafting table]] on the top left corner of the toast. A toast also shows up when obtaining an [[advancement]] and for warnings and errors by applying a [[resource pack]], joining a server where chat messages cannot be reported, when there is not enough space on computer, when a song starts playing, or when changing [[narrator]]s settings. A toast can be shown using commands like {{cmd|recipe}} or {{cmd|advancement}}.

{{IN|be}}, toasts are shown when the player unlocks crafting recipes and are not visible while in Creative mode. Visible toasts can be declined by pressing {{Keys|M}}. Toasts are also shown in [[menu screen]]s for pack error messages, while importing or downloading a pack/world, warnings about full [[screenshot]] storage, or for game invites. These toasts can be opened by pressing {{Keys|N}}/tapping on it, which redirects to the settings tab or resource pack with the problem. The duration of menu toast messages can be adjusted in the accessibility [[settings]].

A different, animated light gray toast appears on the action bar when the game enters sleep mode, prompting the player to press any button.
