'''Aotearoa New Zealand''' is a [[Marketplace]] map centered around exploring selected parts of [[w:New Zealand|New Zealand]], the main filming location of {{AMCM}}, as part of the {{AMCM|100% Pure New Zealand}} campaign.<ref name=":Business">{{Citation|url=https://businessevents.newzealand.com/news-and-success-stories/new-zealand-now-playable-in-global-game-phenomenon-minecraft/|title=New Zealand now playable in global game phenomenon Minecraft|website=Business Events - Tourism New Zealand|date=March 19, 2025}}</ref>

== Summary ==
The map opens on a title screen, marked "100% Pure New Zealand," which leads to a panning sequence across clouds and into a dense forest into a wharenui, with a song is sung. Once that concludes, the [[player]] spawns inside of a wide yard, with a prompt to interact with two characters, Pania and Koro. Koro can be found under a [[Planks|wooden]] awning, and explains that the wharenui is a place of gathering, expressing interest in helping in the filming of ''A Minecraft Movie''. They hand over a camera to assist with the scouting, and recommends checking out the turapa inside the wharenui.

Pania can be found close by, above a small set of [[stairs]] leading into the wharenui, and explains New Zealand's relation with nature; Tiaki. Inside the building, the player can select any of the six areas using octagonal portals. When selecting the area, the turapa behind them will light up with the area's title. Although there's an open entrance to the wilderness opposite to the wharenui, it cannot be passed. Beside it are two wood carvings, and a stylized tree with several {{Wikipedia|kōkako}} resting.

=== Waitomo Caves ===
The area begins on a path of [[Packed Mud|packed mud]], surrounded by [[Leaves|bushes]], [[Stone|rock formations]], and [[Tall Grass|tall grass]]. Behind the player are two signs, instructing them to be prepared and not litter. The first instructions are to talk to a character named Kaiawhina, who introduces the player to Waitomo. After speaking with them, the player will be transported to a 2D section, inside of a [[sandstone]] cave, with three objectives: to capture photos of a [[stalagmite]], a [[stalactite]], and a glowworm. Beside them is a {{Wikipedia|Australian pied cormorant|kāruhiruhi}}, which can be snapped. Although a cave is visible, it cannot be entered.

Moving {{Control|right|text=forward}}, the player will collect an item, and then drop down to a slightly dark area to collect another, before climbing a ladder into a darker area. From there the player can drop and climb up several paths, all leading into the same area.{{Needs testing}} Exiting the 2D section returns to 3D, with stalagmites and stalactites nearby, both giving the same description when snapped. At the end of the tunnel, past several [[Spring|springs]], is a sign pointing towards a second 2D area.

Immediately, an added challenge is evident, in the form of a [[Water|waterfall]]. Jumping down leads deeper into the cave, where the player can choose between continuing {{Control|right|text=forward}} or {{Control|jump|text=swimming}} up into an aquifer. The section ends when the player discovers a boat, leading to a ride where they must take pictures of glowworms throughout a dark cavern. Once the ride concludes, the player will return to the beginning area at night, and if al three photos are taken can return to the hub, Kaiawhina thanking them.

=== Te Puia, Rotorua ===
The area begins with the player facing Tipene, who explains the significance of the area, and offers three explanations of subjects; arts, {{Wikipedia|geysers}}, and {{Wikipedia|Kiwi (bird)|kiwi}}. From there the player receives three photo requirements: a geothermal vent, a mud pool, and Te Puia {{Wikipedia|Tekoteko}}. Nearby is a small wooden hut, with a red tekoteko stationed on a wooden pole to its left. Green collectibles can direct the player down a path, beside several billboards, telling people to keep the country clean and show respect. Eventually a fork appears, one road using the same path, the other packed mud.

On the continued road, another tekoteko can be found surrounded by bushes, with the mud pool not far away in a quarry. Several mud pools can be found, bubbling light gray, a stairway leading to a balcony with three. The final photo opportunity is the vent, also very close to the mud pools. However, the first encountered are very small, with minuscule smoke. A far larger one can be found after crossing a bridge, with an NPC named Timu greeting the player, representing the {{Wikipedia|New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute}}. They offer to explain the institute's tourism and education, beside two structures, one made of [[Smooth Quartz Block|smooth quartz]], and another made of [[Deepslate Bricks|deepslate bricks]] and [[Cobbled Deepslate|cobbled deepslate]].{{More info}}

Progressing down the path leads to a large tree surrounded by [[Moss Block|moss]]. Passing by [[Mossy Cobblestone|mossy cobblestone]] and [[azalea]] bushes lead to a large valley of geysers, with many signs encouraging photography. Eventually, a roadblock sign can be found, and in the distance a building made of [[blackstone]], with another red tekoteko. The path will lead uphill, and after a long hike will lead to a bending bridge over a lake. The road will finally end at the end of a third bridge, reaching a dead end in the form of a cave blocked by [[Sign|mangrove signs]].

Upon snapping all three photos, the area will be completed.

=== Kāpiti, Wellington ===
The area begins with the player facing Manaaki, who welcomes them to Kāpiti Island, explaining its role as an animal sanctuary. From there three goals are given: finding photo opportunities for shore, swamp, and forest birds. Nearby, Pania can be found beside a small structure, explaining the rich culture and animal sanctuaries of the area. The area splits into three, ginormous paths, with dense, thick trees.

To the left of spawn is an uphill path to a grove with hundreds of bushes, where several {{Wikipedia|weka}}, {{Wikipedia|tākapu}} can be found. This road circles around and swivels into several paths, leading to a gravelly beach. However, after a certain point the player will be blocked by an invisible wall.

To the right of spawn is a dense swamp, with {{Wikipedia|black swan}}s, {{w|Royal spoonbill|spoonbill}}s, and {{w|pūtangitangi}}. Although there is a long path, little can be found along the way, the back being a dead-end of shrubs.

To the back of spawn is a forest. Upon entering it, the time will quickly shift to [[Daylight cycle|night]], and to [[Daylight cycle|day]] when exited. Here, {{Wikipedia|pīwakawaka}}, {{w|Kiwi (bird)|kiwi}}, and {{Wikipedia|morepork|ruru}} mobs can be found frolicking between [[Azure Bluet|azure bluets]]. Continuing forward the player will go up a hill beside a short dead end, leading into a maze of circling paths, trees, elevations, and occasional mobs. At the end is a small platform made of wood, where players can gaze out into a large forest.

Once all three photos are taken, the area will be completed.

=== Torrent Bay, Abel Tasman ===
The area begins in a campground, the player surrounded by tents as they receive a pop-up explaining the setting. Three NPCs are situated nearby. Rapato explains the ancestral history of the area and {{Wikipedia|Te Āti Awa|Te Ātiawa}}, and introduces their ancestor Tūrangapeke. Tama hails from the {{Wikipedia|Ngāti Rārua}} tribe, who have fished and explored the area for generations. Te Pūoho shares the story of the Ngāti Rārua and {{Wikipedia|Tino rangatiratanga|Tinorangatiratanga}}, directing to {{Wikipedia|Te Waikoropupū Springs}}.  Nearby the campsite is a building with [[Cut Copper|oxidized cut copper]] roofing, though nothing can be found outside, and not inside for it can't be entered. Similarly, two paths can be found at the camp, ultimately leading nowhere. At the coast is Lee-Anne, an NPC the player is directed to speak with, who is revealed to be a tour guide for "your Waka experience."

Once the player agrees to join the boat, Lee-Anne will explain to ready a camera, for the trip will be all about the history of the area and come with plentiful photo opportunities. Once the conversation ends, the player will be placed on a boat, kayaking towards several points. In order to maneuver the boat, they must utilized {{Wikipedia|tank controls}}, rotating by moving the camera and only being able to go {{Control|forward}} and {{Control|backwards}}.Eventually, the player will fond a shore with rocks and a glowing halo, similar to those in the wharenui, signaling to take a photo. The first is for a {{w|New Zealand fur seal}}.

After paddling away from there, the player will find a vacant sea, discovering a {{w|Southern right whale|tohorā}}. From there, the player will reach a very narrow shore at a plateau, and can snap a picture of a {{w|Little_penguin|kororā}}. Although a vast spread of water is visible, the player will be blocked by an invisible wall.

Once all three photos are taken, the area will be completed, concluding on a panning cinematic over a river and into a stylized lake.{{More info}}
