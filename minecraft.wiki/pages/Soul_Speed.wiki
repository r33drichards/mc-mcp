'''Soul Speed''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[boots]] that causes faster movement on [[soul sand]] and [[soul soil]], but slowly drains [[durability]] in the process.

== Obtaining ==

==== Loot chest ====
{{LootChestItem|enchanted-book-rnd-soul-speed}}

Soul Speed can be acquired via [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s, who may offer [[enchanted book]]s and [[iron boots]] with a random level of Soul Speed. Piglins may spawn wearing [[golden boots]] enchanted with Soul Speed which have a chance to be dropped when they are killed. Enchanted books and golden boots with a random level of Soul Speed may appear in [[bastion remnant]] "generic" chests.

Soul Speed is a treasure enchantment. It cannot be obtained from [[enchanting]] in an [[enchanting table]]. Unlike most other treasure enchantments, it also cannot be obtained from most [[chest loot]] (except from chests in bastion remnants), [[fishing]], or [[trading]].

== Usage ==
=== Speed ===
When walking on [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]], Soul Speed increases the player's speed. When wearing [[boots]] with Soul Speed, the player's speed is adjusted by the multiplier {{cd|(Soul Speed Level * 0.105) + 1.3}}. The speed decrease of soul sand has no effect on Soul Speed, meaning that the player can walk on soul sand with the same speed as on soul soil.

While Soul Speed walkways are not as fast as some other means of transit (such as [[blue ice]] tracks), Soul Speed boots do not require vehicles such as minecarts or boats in order to apply their speed boost. This makes Soul Speed walkways useful for increasing movement speed across more uneven or varied terrain where vehicles might prove unwieldy. 

[[Carpet]]s or [[slab]]s{{Only|Java|short=1}} on top of soul sand or soul soil does not prevent the speed increase from Soul Speed.

=== Durability ===
The durability of worn boots enchanted with Soul Speed has a 4% chance to go down for each compatible block stepped on.{{verify}}<ref>{{bug|MC-274447||Soul speed can use durability when equipping boots while standing on soul blocks}}</ref> This chance can be decreased with the [[Unbreaking]] enchantment.

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|be}} the particles generated by the enchantment are bright in the darkness because they don't respect light levels.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-100534}} Resolved as Won't Fix</ref>
* Soul Speed works via stomping the souls out of the blocks, hence the particles.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcHiRdrsAfk&t=2510s</ref>
* {{IN|be}}, in [[Spectator]] mode, if a player wearing boots with Soul Speed flies over soul sand or soul soil, the particle effect still plays.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-165655}}</ref>
