'''''Manor Road''''' is a point and click game created by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Blockjam Bundle]] game jam.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes role of Ashley, who is travelling via a train to Liverpool. They can move around the train wagon by clicking the desired destination, which will make them automatically walk there. There are other characters in the wagon, including the conductor, the player can click on them to interact. In the top right corner, there's a sanity meter. The player's sanity starts off full.

If the player interacts with a character, the character will talk to the player, but the player will not be able to respond. After all characters are interacted with, the conductor announces that the train is arriving at Manor Road. The train stops and after a while leaves the station.

When the other characters are interacted with, the player can now respond. The response is chosen by clicking an option from a list. Depending on how the player handles the conversation, they can either clear it or fail, with each choice either reducing or improving sanity. The interactions cannot be retried.

After interacting with all the characters again, if the player has failed any of the interactions, the conductor once again announces the train is arriving at Manor Road. The train will stop and leave the station all the same. The player will now be able to retry failed interactions, however the cleared interactions will remain locked.

This continues in a loop until either the player clears interactions with all the characters, or sanity is fully lost. If all interactions are cleared, the good ending is achieved: "a mysterious tear in time opens up", Manor Road becomes the final destination of the train, and Ashley gets off it. Losing all sanity causes the bad ending: Ashley goes mad and is "forever lost between Manor Road stations".
