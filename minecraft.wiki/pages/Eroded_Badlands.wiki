The '''eroded badlands''' or '''mesa bryce''' is a variant of the [[badlands]] notable for its hoodoos.

== Description ==
The biome generates similar to regular badlands, with red, orange, yellow, white, light gray, brown, and regular [[terracotta]] forming the landscape. Lower grounds are mostly made of [[red sand]] and [[red sandstone]], with brown terracotta underneath. [[Dead bush]]es grow on terracotta and red sand, while [[cacti]] along with occasional [[cactus flower]]s only appear on red sand. Like all badlands biomes, [[gold ore]] generates more frequently and closer to the surface, and [[mineshaft]]s made out of dark oak can also be found, often exposed to air. Terrain underwater in [[lake]]s is coated with a layer of orange terracotta, with shallow areas occasionally featuring white terracotta too. Deeper bodies of water may contain scattered gravel. 

[[Rainfall]] never occurs in eroded badlands, as the biome is arid, and [[lightning]] never strikes here. Exception to both rules are [[river]]s that cut through eroded badlands, which still experience both.

Eroded badlands feature unique formations of terracotta [[wikipedia:Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]], narrow spires that rise up from the red sand floor of the biome's drainage basins. Thanks to these hoodoos, eroded badlands provide a more accessible source of terracotta, allowing players to gather it without digging into the terrain. The hoodoos only generate at lower elevations. At higher elevations, the biome is indistinct from the regular badlands. The biome is intended to resemble the famous [[wikipedia:Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]] in Utah, USA, which features hoodoos across its landscape. 

Mobs found within eroded badlands are the same as regular badlands: [[Animal spawning|Farm animals]] can only spawn on player-created [[grass blocks]] in this biome, and generate their warm variants if possible. [[Armadillo]]s also inhabit eroded badlands. 

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], eroded badlands have unique atmospherics, lighting, and color grading which appears dry and yellow with slightly more color than deserts, although they use default volumetric [[fog]]. 

Eroded badlands generate in place of regular badlands in positive [[World generation#Biomes|weirdness]] when [[humidity]] values are low, which often results in eroded badlands getting separated from badlands by a river. Biomes that often border eroded badlands include [[desert]]s, regular badlands (which can sometimes generate adjacent), [[savanna]]s, [[savanna plateau]]s, [[plains]], and uncommonly [[forest]]s and [[stony peaks]]. Badlands can also generate in [[Mountains|mountain]] peaks, where they can elevate up to Y=256. The [[deep dark]] might generate beneath eroded badlands. [[Lush caves]], however, never generate under eroded badlands.
