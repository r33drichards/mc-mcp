== Additions ==
=== Items ===
{{Additions table
|Armadillo Scute
|Armadillo Spawn Egg Revision 1
|Wolf Armor
}}
'''[[File:Armadillo Scute JE2 BE2.png|class=pixel-image|x32px]] [[Armadillo Scute]]'''
* Dropped by [[armadillo]]s periodically and when [[brush]]ed.
* [[Dispenser]]s can be used to brush armadillo scutes off armadillos.
* Can be used to craft and repair [[wolf armor]].

'''[[Spawn Egg]]'''
* [[File:Armadillo Spawn Egg JE3 BE3.png|width=32x32]] Added [[armadillo spawn egg]]s.

'''[[File:Wolf Armor JE3 BE3.png|class=pixel-image|x32px]] [[Wolf Armor]]'''
[[File:All Dyes on Collars and Wolf Armor.png|thumb|[[Wolves]] wearing dyed [[wolf armor]] in all 16 basic colors]]
* Crafted with 6 [[armadillo scute]]s in a harness shape.
* Protects [[wolves]] from most damage sources until the armor loses all durability and breaks.
** Provides an armor value of {{armor|11}}.
* Shows signs of increased breakage as durability goes down.
* Using wolf armor on an adult tamed wolf will equip the armor on the wolf, and using [[shears]] will make it drop the armor.
** Only a wolf's owner can put on / shear off wolf armor. That also excludes dispensers.
* The wolf's owner can repair the armor with [[armadillo scute]]s while it is equipped on the [[wolf]].
* If a wolf dies while wearing armor, it will drop the armor.
* Wolf armor can be dyed in similar fashion to [[leather armor]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Armadillo JE2 BE2.png|x32px]] [[Armadillo]]'''
* The winner of [[Minecraft Live 2023]]'s Mob Vote.
* A passive mob that spawns in [[savanna]] and [[badlands]] biomes with the same frequency as [[chicken]]s and [[pig]]s.
* Has {{hp|12}} health points.
* Can drop [[armadillo scute]]s either periodically or when [[brush]]ed, but drops no loot when killed.
** Armadillos drop scutes at around the same rate as [[chicken]]s lay eggs.
** Brushing takes 16 durability from the [[brush]].
* Can be bred with [[spider eye]]s.
* If an armadillo detects a threat, it will roll up.
** Threats include:
*** A player [[sprinting]].
*** A player in a vehicle or mounted.
*** Anyone it has been attacked by recently.
*** [[Undead]] mobs.
** Special cases where an armadillo will not roll up include when it is:
*** Fleeing.
*** In water or in the air.
*** On a leash.
** When an armadillo is rolled up it cannot walk nor eat, and will not be tempted by food. Additionally, it will be protected by its shell, causing it to take reduced damage and completely negating damage from weaker attacks.
** While rolled up, armadillo continuously scans for threats. If no threats are detected for 3 seconds, it unrolls. Armadillos peek out to see if “the coast is clear” before unrolling.

'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Added variants of wolves. [[File:Wolf variants.png|right|thumb|The nine variations of wolves.]]

=== Items ===
'''[[Durability]] bar'''

=== Technical ===
'''[[API]]'''
* Dynamic imports (e.g., {{cd|import("/my-module.js")}}) should be functional again.
* {{cd|BlockTypes}} will now return valid types for flattened or refactored block names.
* {{cd|EntityMountTamingComponent}}

** Renamed {{cd|setTamed}} to {{cd|tame}}.
* Released {{cd|BlockComponentTypes}} from {{cd|beta}} to 1.10.0
* Released {{cd|EntityComponentTypes}} from {{cd|beta}} to 1.10.0
* Released {{cd|ItemComponentTypes}} from {{cd|beta}} to 1.10.0
* Removed {{cd|EntityHealableComponent.filters}} as they currently have no backing implementation.
* Added {{cd|PaletteColor}} enum to {{cd|beta}} for use with {{cd|ItemColorComponent/ItemColor2Component}}.
* Added {{cd|ItemColor2Component}} to {{cd|beta}} for reading {{cd|minecraft:color2}}.

* Added “extend_player_rendering” component to the {{cd|minecraft:free}} camera.
** This component is intended to be an enhancement and improvement to current functionality and as such will be “set to true” by default.
** Setting this component to false will remove the added rendering capability. Documentation will be undated prior to release.
* The server now sends chunks and actors around the camera to the client if that information already exists on the server even when the camera is placed far away from the player.

'''Components'''
* The {{cd|interact}} component’s fields {{cd|equip_item_slot}} and {{cd|drop_item_slot}} now support both armor and inventory slots:

** Inventory slots are specified as positive numbers, now expressed as strings.
** This change requires a world version of 1.20.80 or higher.
* Added {{cd|repair_entity_item}} field to the {{cd|interact}} component, which allows to repair an item in one of the entity’s inventory or armor slots.
* Added the {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_blocked}} component, which prevents an entity from visually rotating their body to match their own facing direction.
* The durations and cooldowns of {{cd|behavior.timer_flag_1}}, {{cd|behavior.timer_flag_2}}, and {{cd|behavior.timer_flag_3}} are now correctly randomized on both start and stop, rather than only on spawn.

'''Entity Filters'''
* Added new entity filter {{cd|is_sitting}}, which checks if the entity is sitting.
* Added new entity filter {{cd|has_damaged_equipment}}, which checks if the entity has a certain damaged piece of equipment in the specified slot.

'''[[Mob]]s'''
* Added spawn categories, which will be used in the future for [[mob spawning]].
** Spawn categories have been enabled in entity [[behavior pack]] files, but are not yet functional.

'''[[Molang]]'''
* Added new query {{cd|query.armor_slot_damage}}, which returns the damage value of the armor item in the specified slot.

'''[[Recipes]]'''
* Added {{cd|assume_symmetry}} boolean property for Shaped Recipes to allow for symmetrical shaped recipes with different outputs.
