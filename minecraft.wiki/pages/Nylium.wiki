'''Nylium''' is a variant of [[netherrack]] that generates in [[the Nether]]. It has two variants: [[warped nylium]] and [[crimson nylium]], each spawning in different biomes.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break nylium is [[pickaxe]]. Nylium needs to be broken using a pickaxe, otherwise the breaking time will increase and the block drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Nylium|Pickaxe|Wooden|drop=0}}
Nylium drops 1 netherrack block when it's destroyed using a tool without [[Silk Touch]].<br>
Nylium drops itself when it's destroyed using a tool with Silk Touch.

=== Natural generation ===
Warped nylium generates in the [[warped forest]] biome, and crimson nylium generates in the [[crimson forest]] biome.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
Nylium is dropped when an [[enderman]] dies while holding it.

=== Chest loot ===
{{LootChestItem|crimson-nylium}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{ctrl|Using}} [[bone meal]] on [[netherrack]] that is placed next to or adjacent to warped or crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into nylium of that type. Only certain blocks (mainly [[Transparency|transparent]] blocks) can be directly above the netherrack during this process, including but not limited to [[air]], [[Glass|glass blocks]], [[Chest|chests]], and [[Slab|slabs]]. Note that some transparent blocks, such as [[glowstone]], prevent this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a [[dispenser]] with bone meal directly into that netherrack block. If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread.

=== Renewability ===
{{exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
As [[netherrack]] generates in [[nether portal]]s spawn floating, using bone meal on netherrack turns them into nylium, making them renewable.

== Usage ==
Similar to [[grass block]]s and [[mycelium]], nylium decays (based on [[random tick]]s) into netherrack when an [[opaque]] block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath [[water]] or [[lava]].<ref>{{bug|MC-173356|||WAI}}</ref> It decays when covered with [[snow]].<ref>{{bug|MC-174639|||WAI}}</ref>

Like mycelium and [[podzol]], [[mushroom]]s can remain on nylium blocks in any [[light]] level. [[Huge mushroom]]s can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on nylium.

[[Nether fungi]] can likewise be grown into [[huge fungi]] using [[bone meal]], although the fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal is never consumed. 

Nylium is also the only block which the fungus of its type can be grown.

Similar to [[grass block]]s, the player can apply [[bone meal]] to nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generates vegetation that occurs in its native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly [[crimson forest]] vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly [[warped forest]] vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occasionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5×5 area centered on the nylium block on which bone meal is used. 

=== Note blocks ===
Nylium can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

* The name is a portmanteau of "[[The Nether|Nether]]" and "[[Mycelium]]", the name of the part of a fungus analogous to roots.
