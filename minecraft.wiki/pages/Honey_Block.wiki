'''Honey blocks''' are storage blocks equivalent to four [[honey bottle]]s. Honey blocks are sticky and can be used in conjunction with [[piston]]s to move blocks and adhered entities.

== Usage ==
=== Redstone ===
Unlike the [[slime block]], the honey block {{in|java}} is non-conductive and cannot have a [[redstone]] signal sent through it (including via a [[repeater]] or an [[observer]], etc). {{IN|bedrock}}, honey blocks are conductive, which is notable behavior because it is transparent and both mobs and players will not suffocate while they are inside of it.

When being moved by a [[piston]], entities on a honey block's top surface move with it. They are not launched in the direction of the push, as a slime block would do. Honey blocks moved by pistons do not move entities that are touching the side or bottom of the block.<ref>{{bug|MC-163122||Honey blocks don't move entities from the side|WAI}}</ref>

When a honey block is moved by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent blocks in the same direction. A honey block can move any block a [[sticky piston]] can ''pull'', except for [[glazed terracotta]] and [[slime block]]s. The blocks that are moved may, in turn, push other blocks, as if they were being pushed by a piston. For example, a honey block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which pushes additional ground blocks in the direction of motion.

When the adjacent block that is moved is also a honey block, that block ''also'' attempts to move all its adjacent blocks. For example, a 2×2×2 cube of honey blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube.

A honey block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. However, if an adjacent block ''could'' be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the honey block is also prevented from moving. [[Liquid]]s are an exception: they are not moved, but neither do they stop a piston from pushing or pulling blocks into their space (usually destroying the liquid, and in a rare case displacing it through the piston).<ref>{{bug|MC-75581||Water and lava teleport or disappear when moved via slime blocks|WAI}}</ref> 

Honey blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-honey) block is moved by a piston.

The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2×2×3 of honey blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it. However, the platform in which a honey block shifts is entirely dependent on the placement of the sticky piston, as well as placement of blocks too.

=== Slowing down entities ===
Honey blocks slow down [[entities]] walking on top of them and prevent them from jumping. Players walking on honey blocks move at 2.508 m/s, about a 60% reduction from the normal walking speed. {{IN|bedrock}}, players also slow down slightly if walking up against the side of it. Players, who can ordinarily [[jump]] about {{frac|1|1|4}} [[block]]s high, can jump about {{frac|3|16}} blocks high on honey; this is an 85% reduction. They can more easily step up onto other blocks than jump up onto them.

This effect applies even through other blocks on top of honey blocks as long as they are half-block or less in height - so the player cannot jump on [[carpet]]s, bottom [[slab]]s or [[daylight detector]]s that are placed on honey blocks.

This effect also applies regardless of a player's mode of movement, such as flying with [[elytra]] or [[swimming]].

=== Sliding ===
Entities pressed against the sides of a honey block slide down at a slow speed and do not take fall [[damage]], similar to going down a [[ladder]]. {{IN|java}}, the entity's horizontal momentum gradually decreases; this allows players to jump 2 blocks further by holding on to the walls. {{IN|bedrock}}, the entity's horizontal momentum resets instead. The slowdown induced by honey blocks stacks with the [[Slow Falling]] status effect. It is important that a honey block is NOT a [[full block]], the transparent yellow corona around it is not solid. This is testable by [[sneaking]] around it on a one block wide area.

=== Falling ===
As with [[hay bale]]s, falling onto a honey block reduces fall damage by 80%. For example, if a [[player]] or mob falls from a height that would normally cause {{hp|10}} fall damage, the fall causes {{hp|2}} damage instead.

=== Bees ===
When a honey block is near [[bee]]s and a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]], bees occasionally fly close and attach to it for a few seconds, resembling an action of eating honey. When doing this, the bee stops fluttering its wings, and firmly attaches its face to the honey block regardless of whether flowers are nearby.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
Although the 2×2 inventory crafting grid is sufficient to craft a honey block, a 3×3 crafting table grid is required to convert a honey block back into four honey bottles.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Honey blocks are not full [[block]]s: despite taking up 16{{^|3}} pixels, the collision box is only 14×14×15 pixels. 
** The bottom face of the honey block is the same depth as a full block, though it is only 14×14 pixels.
** Small [[entities]] such as [[arrow]]s are free to move through the gap between honey blocks as they are under 2 pixels wide.
** Only when entities are partially "in" the honey block (i.e., they are touching the 14{{^|3}}-pixel hitbox) can they slide down against it.
* In real life, bees eat honey when the temperature is low and flowers are difficult to find. Otherwise, pollen and nectar are their primary food sources.
* The bottom surface of the honey block does not slow down entities.
* It takes 1 minute and 14 seconds to slide down 256 honey blocks.
* The [[player]] cannot place some [[block]]s on the honey block such as [[vine]]s, [[ladder]]s and [[torch]]es.{{only|java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-131115||Torches, levers, buttons, tripwire hooks, coral fans, vines, ladders and bells cannot be placed on the sides of farmland or grass paths|WAI}}</ref>
