A '''mooshroom''' is a mushroom-covered variant of a [[cow]] exclusive to the rare [[mushroom fields]] biome.

== Spawning ==
Red mooshrooms can spawn in [[mushroom fields]] [[biome]]s in herds of 4–8 on [[mycelium]] blocks. They do not naturally spawn in any other biome.

Red mooshrooms have a 5% chance of spawning as babies.

A red mooshroom transforms into a brown mooshroom, and vice versa, when it is struck by [[lightning]]. Brown mooshrooms never spawn naturally.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Breeding ===
{{Main|Breeding}}

A pair of mooshrooms can breed when being given [[wheat]]. A mooshroom cannot be bred with a cow.

Breeding two red mooshrooms has a {{frac|1|1024}} chance to spawn a brown baby variant and vice versa. When breeding a red mooshroom and a brown mooshroom together, the baby has a {{frac|1|2}} chance of being either variant.

Feeding wheat to a baby mooshroom shortens its growing time by 10% of the remaining time. Baby mooshrooms do not have mushrooms on their backs; they appear once the baby grows to an adult.

== Drops ==
=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} upon successful [[breeding]]
=== On death ===

* {{xp|1|3}} (when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]])

Shearing a mooshroom drops 5 corresponding [[mushroom]]s and turns the mooshroom into a temperate [[cow]], emitting a smaller version of the [[particles#largeexplode|explosion]] particle. The mushrooms do not grow back.

Like other baby animals, killing a baby mooshroom yields no items or experience.

== Behavior ==
Mooshrooms have the same AI behavior as cows: they walk around slowly and aimlessly, huffing and mooing occasionally. They avoid danger such as cliffs, fire, or lava, but make no attempt to stay out of water.

A mooshroom follows a player holding [[wheat]]. 

A [[lightning]] strike 4 blocks within a mooshroom switches its color, from red to brown, and vice versa. Mooshrooms do not take damage from lightning during this transformation.

=== Milking ===
A mooshroom can be milked by {{control|using}} a [[bucket]] on it, yielding a [[milk bucket]]. Mooshrooms can also be {{control|used|text=milked}} using [[bowl]]s to get [[mushroom stew]].

When a small flower is used on a brown mooshroom, the brown mooshroom produces a [[suspicious stew]] related to that small flower the next time it is {{control|use item|text=milked}} with a [[bowl]]. Red mooshrooms do not produce suspicious stew. The brown mooshroom returns to producing mushroom stew until fed another small flower. The small flowers produce the suspicious stew with the following effects.

{{:Suspicious Stew/Effects}}

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Mooshroom.png|thumb|width=165x165|A red mooshroom ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult mooshroom to form a [[jockey]].

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|earth}}, there was a buttercup-covered variant of mooshrooms known as "[[moobloom]]s".<ref>{{tweet|jorax79|1151394648281120769|Mooblooms! A new mob variant in Minecraft Earth!|July 17, 2019}}</ref> This variant was also part of the [[Minecraft Live 2020]] Mob Vote. It came last and there are currently no known plans to add it to the game.
