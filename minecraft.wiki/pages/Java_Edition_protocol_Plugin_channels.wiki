'''Plugin channels''' allow client mods and server plugins to communicate without cluttering up chat. [https://web.archive.org/web/20220711204310/https://dinnerbone.com/blog/2012/01/13/minecraft-plugin-channels-messaging/ This post by Dinnerbone] is a good introduction and basic documentation.

==== Chunk Section Position ====

Represents a box with integer precision

<b>Note:</b> What you are seeing here is the latest version of the [[Minecraft Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg merge/Data types|Data types]] article, but the position type was [https://wiki.vg/index.php?title=Data_types&oldid=14345#Position different before 1.14].

64-bit value split into three '''signed''' integer parts:

* x: 22 MSBs
* z: 22 middle bits
* y: 20 LSBs

For example, a 64-bit position can be broken down as follows:

Example value (big endian): <code><span style="outline: solid 2px rgb(255, 0, 0)">0000000000000000000000</span> <span style="outline: solid 2px rgb(0, 0, 255)">0000000000000000000000</span> <span style="outline: solid 2px rgb(0, 255, 0)">00000000000000000000</span></code><br>
* The red value is the X coordinate, which is <code>0</code> in this example.<br>
* The blue value is the Z coordinate, which is <code>0</code> in this example.<br>
* The green value is the Y coordinate, which is <code>0</code> in this example.<br>

Encoded as follows:

 ((x & 0x3FFFFF) << 42) | ((z & 0x3FFFFF) << 20) | (y & 0xFFFFF)

And decoded as:

 val = read_long();
 x = val >> 42;
 z = val << 20 >> 42;
 y = val << 42 >> 42;

Note: The above assumes that the right shift operator sign extends the value (this is called an {{wikipedia|arithmetic shift}}), so that the signedness of the coordinates is preserved. In many languages, this requires the integer type of <code>val</code> to be signed.

== Channels internal to Minecraft ==

These are channels used by Minecraft. Most of them are debugging-related except for brand.

=== Brand ===

Announces the server and client implementation name right after a player has logged in.

These brands are used in crash reports and a few other locations. It's recommended that custom clients and servers use their own brand names for the purpose of identification. The brand is not processed in any other way, and Notchian clients will connect to servers with different brands with no issue (the brand is not used to validate).

The Notchian server sends a <code>minecraft:brand</code> packet right after it sends a [[Minecraft Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg merge/Protocol#Login (play)|Login (play)]] packet, and the Notchian client sends it right after receiving a Login (play) packet. However, some modified clients and servers will not send this packet (or will take longer to send it than normal), so it is important to not crash if the brand has not been sent. Additionally, the brand may change at any time (for instance, if connected through a BungeeCord instance, you may switch from a server with one brand to a server with another brand without receiving a Login (play) packet).

== Notable community plugin channels ==

Channels listed in this section are not used by the vanilla Minecraft client or server. This is just a likely-incomplete list of channels used by mods/plugins popular within the Minecraft community.

=== Register ===

{| class="wikitable"
 ! Channel
 ! Bound to
 ! Field Name
 ! Field Type
 ! Notes
 |-
 | <code>minecraft:register</code>
 | Two-way
 | Channels
 | {{Type|Byte Array}}
 | An ASCII (sometimes UTF-8) string without a length prefix containing the channels separated by \u0000
 |}

Allows the client or server to register for one or more custom channels, indicating that data should be sent on those channels if the receiving end supports it too. This format is used on Bukkit, BungeeCord, Velocity and Fabric API.

=== Unregister ===

{| class="wikitable"
 ! Channel
 ! Bound to
 ! Field Name
 ! Field Type
 ! Notes
 |-
 | <code>minecraft:unregister</code>
 | Two-way
 | Channels
 | {{Type|Byte Array}}
 | An ASCII (sometimes UTF-8) string without a length prefix containing the channels separated by \u0000
 |}

Allows the client or server to unregister from one or more custom channels, indicating that the receiving end should stop sending data on those channels. This format is used on Bukkit, BungeeCord, Velocity and Fabric API.

=== "Common" standard ===

The common standard was created by the FabricMC, NeoForged, PaperMC and SpongePowered team because the current register channel lacked the game phase. It is currently used by Fabric API and NeoForge. The current version of the standard is 1, which contains the following payloads:

==== Supported Versions ====

 | "play" or "configuration"
 |-
 | Channels
 | {{Type|Prefixed Array}} of {{Type|Identifier}}
 |
 |}

Note: this standard only supports registering channels, not unregistering.

=== BungeeCord ===

<code>bungeecord:main</code>

Formerly <code>BungeeCord</code>; additionally, note that the channel name is remapped by spigot so that the old name can still be used in plugins.

=== Forge ===

{{Main|Minecraft Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg merge/Minecraft Forge Handshake}}

<code>fml:handshake</code>, <code>fml:play</code>

Previously <code>FML|HS</code>, <code>FML</code>

Used by [http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php Minecraft Forge] to negotiate required mods, among other things.
[https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.15.x/src/main/java/net/minecraftforge/fml/network/NetworkInitialization.java <code>fml:handshake</code> and <code>fml:play</code>]

=== Fabric API ===

<code>fabric:accepted_attachments_v1</code>, <code>fabric:attachment_sync_v1</code>, <code>fabric:custom_ingredient_sync</code> and much more

=== WorldEdit CUI ===

{{Main|/WorldEditCUI}}

<code>worldedit:cui</code>

Used by the server-side [http://www.enginehub.org/worldedit/ WorldEdit] and the client-side [http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1292886-worldeditcui/ WorldEditCUI] to coordinate selections.
