'''Shazboots!''' is a joke [[status effect]] in [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine]].

== Effect ==
This effect causes the player to begin to slide around on any blocks like [[ice]] and the speed increases to around a level equivalent to [[Speed]] 15. In addition, when the player jumps, a blue bar appears that acts like a jump bar for a [[horse]], and while flying, the player slows down a lot. The amount of time that the effect is given for is so short that it doesn't have much of an effect.
