'''Bear''' is a character appearing in the [[2017]] iteration of [[Minecraft: Official Magazine (2017)|Minecraft: Official Magazine]], as well as several annuals.

== Appearance ==
Being a survival expert, Bear has a very messy appearance, with a face appearing to scream. Their teeth are noticeably tall, with an upraised, long nose, and high blackish blue eyes under a headband. His hair is long, with long braids or bangs, a leaf and flower covering his left side, using the same color scheme as face paint on his cheeks. His clothes are similarly covered by leaves, with a leaf wristband on his right arm. Below are a tattered white shirt, ripped [[leather]] colored pants, and brown shoes.

== Personality ==
{{Expand section}}
A very abrasive, paranoid figure, Bear thrives in the wilderness and is known to go on extreme challenges.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|The most hard-bitten survival expert the world has ever seen – at least in his own estimation – Bear has faced desperate odds with nothing but an egg and steely determination, and then somehow made those odds go crying home to momma. Bear will use any excuse to prove his survival credentials, and is known to suddenly emerge from potted plants to impress upon people the importance of vigilance, before receding into the foliage, whispering, “Become the jungle!” Bear is incapable of not rising to a challenge, no matter how stupid it is. He’s insufferable, ludicrous, self-serious… but, perhaps regretfully, he really knows his stuff.|[[Marsh Davies]]<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-mags-colourful-characters|Meet the Mag’s Colourful Characters|August 11, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>|image=Marsh Davies Mojang avatar.png}}
