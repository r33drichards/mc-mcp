'''Diamond chickens''' were rare joke variants of [[chicken]]s present in the April Fools' [[Java Edition 2.0]]. They lay [[lapis lazuli]] and [[diamond]]s instead of [[egg]]s.

== Spawn ==
Diamond chickens spawn under normal chicken spawning conditions, but only with a 7% chance.

== Color ==
The diamond chicken's texture is identical to the regular chicken's, except the former is multiplied by the 31 DIAMOND color{{info needed|hex code? is this a [[map color]]?}} instead of the usual 16 COLOR color{{info needed|hex code?}} used for white wool and, consequently, the normal chicken color.

== Behavior ==
As chickens were modified in [[Java Edition 2.0|2.0]] to display neutral behavior, diamond chickens are also neutral.

Diamond chickens lay [[diamond]]s and [[lapis lazuli]] instead of eggs. They also have a 5% chance to explode instead of laying an item.
