The '''starting house'''<ref>{{citation|url=http://notch.tumblr.com/post/387901149/that-was-a-lot-of-work-but-it-should-behave-better-now|title=That was a lot of work, but it should behave better now|section=|website=[https://web.archive.org/web/20140427003832/http://notch.tumblr.com/ The World of Notch]|author=[[Markus Persson]]|date=February 14, 2010|quote=The starting house will only spawn in nice places now. Mostly. ;)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427012050/notch.tumblr.com/post/387901149/that-was-a-lot-of-work-but-it-should-behave-better-now}}</ref> was a [[structure]] that acted as the starting place when first spawned in a [[Java Edition Indev]] world. It could be considered the first "[[structure]]" added to the game (though it could also be considered a [[feature]]).

== Generation ==
When creating a new world, the [[player]] spawned inside the starting house located in the center of the world.

== Structure ==
{{main|Starting House/Structure}}
The structure consisted of a single 7 block wide × 7 block long × 4 block tall room, with a 1×2 hole for players to exit and two [[torch]]es on the interior. When starting houses were added, they were made of mossy cobblestone (which was unavailable naturally on the map anywhere else) and 4 [[chest]]s, one filled with [[TNT]], one with a full stack (99 at the time) of every type of [[block]], another with every type of [[item]] and one filled with every color of [[cloth]]. As Indev progressed from testing items and blocks to testing the actual survival aspect, these chests were removed. Later, the design of the house was changed. The floor was changed to [[stone]] and the walls and roof were changed to [[planks]].

== Chest contents ==
The contents of the chests changed between versions.
