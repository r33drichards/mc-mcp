''[[Minecraft]]'' offers '''controls''' tailored for different input methods.  While {{edition|je}} is playable only with a keyboard and mouse, {{edition|be}} has a wider variety of control schemes in order to accommodate players across all platforms. These controls can be changed in the [[options]] menu.

=== Non-configurable controls ===
''Java Edition'' uses a combination of the mouse and keyboard for controls, generically known as "mouselook/keymove." Many prior games (such as ''DOOM'' and ''Quake'') have used such a scheme, but those who have not played such a game before may need practice to get around effectively. [[Creative]] mode or [[Peaceful]] difficulty in Survival mode are helpful for a player to gain familiarity with the controls.

| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|W}}
| style="text-align: center" | Sprint (secondary)
| This is always the same as the current forward key. When pressed twice in quick succession, causes the [[player]] to [[sprint]] (unless the character is too [[Hunger|hungry]]). Attempting to sprint (Double-Tap) while fully submerged underwater initiates swimming.
|}

=== Configurable controls ===
{{info|The default behavior of {{w|Fn}}s (e.g. {{key|F1}}, {{key|F2}}, {{key|F3}}, etc.) differs by system. On macOS, these keys activate system functionality (such as changing the system volume or display brightness) by default, and it necessary to either hold down {{key|Fn}} while pressing the function key or enable the "Use F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys" system setting to send these inputs to Minecraft instead; third-party software which changes the behavior per-app [https://fluorapp.net/ also exists]. Some Windows laptops exhibit similar behavior, and the solution is to either disable the "Fn lock" system setting or hold the {{key|Shift}} key while pressing the function key.|section=1}}
These are controls that a user may change at their preference.

|- id="Jump"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|Space}}
| style="text-align: center" | Jump
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.jump}}
| [[Jump]]. When swimming, keeps the player afloat. When double-tapped, toggles [[Flying|Fly Mode]] ([[Creative]] only). When Fly Mode is on, causes the player to gain [[altitude]] (ascend). Player flies faster if sprinting.
|- id="Sneak"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|Left Shift}}
| style="text-align: center" | Sneak
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.sneak}}
| [[Sneaking|Sneak]]. When Fly Mode is on, causes the player to lose [[altitude]] (descend) unless {{control|jump}} is held.
Holding {{key|Shift}} and pressing {{control|use}} on an usable block with a block in hand overrides the USE action and places the block instead. For example, using a [[lever]] on a block that would usually open an internal inventory (such as a [[dispenser]]) places the lever instead.

Used to get off rideable entities.
|- id="Sprint"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|Left Control}}
| style="text-align: center" | Sprint
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.sprint}}
| Start [[sprinting]]. Increase speed when [[Flying|Fly Mode]] is on.

|-
! colspan=4 | Miscellaneous
|- id="Advancements"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|L}}
| style="text-align: center" | Advancements
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.advancements}}
| Open the [[advancements]] screen.
|- id="Quick Actions"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|G}}
| style="text-align: center" | Quick Actions
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.quickActions}}
| Opens a [[dialog]] or a list of dialogs in the <code>minecraft:quick_actions</code> [[dialog tag]] configured by the world or server.
|- id="Take Screenshot"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|F2}}
| style="text-align: center" | Take Screenshot
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.screenshot}}
| Simply pressing this key takes a screenshot and place it in:<br>
''%appdata%\.minecraft\screenshots'' on Windows<br>
''~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/screenshots'' on macOS<br>
''~/.minecraft/screenshots'' on Linux.
|- id="Toggle Cinematic Camera"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | <small>Not bound</small>
| style="text-align: center" | Toggle {{va|Cinematic Camera}}
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.smoothCamera}}
| Toggles mouse smoothing. Looking around becomes a slow, smooth and more cinematic motion.
|- id="Toggle Fullscreen"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|F11}}
| style="text-align: center" | Toggle Fullscreen
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.fullscreen}}
| Toggles full-screen mode.

When using some Apple keyboards, {{key|F11}} must be pressed while holding {{key|Fn}} and {{key|Option}} to enter fullscreen. Using {{key|F11}} alone toggles Exposé, and pressing {{key|F11}} while holding {{key|Fn}} turns down the volume or vice versa, depending on system preferences.

Some people are experiencing a bug while exiting from full-screen mode that causes an inescapable black screen. When that's the case, use {{key|Alt+Tab}} to switch out of Minecraft and switch it back to windowed mode.

On Linux, mouse input is often buggy while in full-screen mode. After entering full-screen mode on Linux, the mouse typically restricts the player to a single 360-degree rotation. This can be fixed by hitting {{key|Esc}} to release the mouse then hitting {{key|Esc}} again to regrab it.

Also, note that this may not respect multiple monitors and Minecraft may occupy all screens instead of the one it is active on.
|-
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|F1}}
| style="text-align: center" | Toggle GUI
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.toggleGui}}

Use this in conjunction with {{key|F2}} to take screenshots without the HUD. This option is also useful when exploring with a [[map]].

|- id="Toggle Perspective"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|F5}}
| style="text-align: center" | Toggle Perspective
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.togglePerspective}}
| Toggles between first person, [[Third person view|third person]] from the back and [[Third person view|third person]] from the front.
|-
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|F4}}
| style="text-align: center" | Toggle Spectator Shader Effects
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.toggleSpectatorShaderEffects}}
| Toggles the currently active [[shaders|post-processing shader]], such as [[Spectator#Mob_view|screen filters]] when spectating as certain [[mob]]s.
|-

|- id="List Players"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|Tab}}
| style="text-align: center" | List Players
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.playerlist}}
| In [[Multiplayer]], hold the {{key|Tab}} key to see a list of players.
When in the chat window, {{key|Tab}} cycles through possible commands or arguments and also complete player names.
|- id="Open Chat"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|T}}
| style="text-align: center" | Open Chat
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.chat}}

| style="text-align: center" | Open Command
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.command}}
| Opens the chat window with the "/" character already typed. On some keyboards (Nordic layout at least) this button might be asterisk/apostrophe: {{key|<sup>*</sup> <sub>'</sub>}}.
|- id="Social Interactions Screen"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|P}}
| style="text-align: center" |[[Social interactions|Social Interactions Screen]]
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.socialInteractions}}
| Gives players the ability to disable chatting with certain players, thus hiding any messages receiving from them. Whether a player is hidden resets when re-joining a server.
|-
! colspan=4 | Gameplay
|- id="Attack/Destroy"
| style="text-align: center" | [[File:Mouse 1.svg|38px|Left click]]
| style="text-align: center" | Attack/Destroy
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.attack}}
| Destroy blocks (hold down); Attack entity (click once).
|- id="Pick Block"
| style="text-align: center" | [[File:Mouse 3.svg|38px|Middle click]]
| style="text-align: center" | Pick Block
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.pickItem}}
| Pressing that button while looking at a block or an entity makes the game attempt to put a corresponding item for the block or entity in the player's hand. For blocks, it is simply the block in item form. For mobs, the game places the corresponding spawn egg in the player's hand. This also works on [[boat]]s, all types of [[minecarts]], [[paintings]], and [[armor stand]]s{{only|je}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-90947}}</ref> to get the entity in item form. If the item is in the hotbar, it switches the selected hotbar slot to the slot with that item. If the item is not in the hotbar, but in the player's inventory, it moves that item from the inventory into the hotbar. If no hotbar slot is empty, the item selected is replaced. In Creative mode, if the item is not in the inventory, the game gives the player that item.

Hovering over an item in any inventory and clicking with the mouse wheel when in Creative gives one full stack of that item. Dragging over slots of inventory/container while holding an item fills them with full stacks of copies of that item.

If used on a tile entity while holding {{key|Control}}, or {{Key|Command}} (for some Mac computers), the tile entity's nbt data are copied. The block given to the player has the Lore: ''(+DATA)''{{only|be}}.
|- id="Use Item/Place Block"
| style="text-align: center" | [[File:Mouse 2.svg|38px|Right click]]
| style="text-align: center" | Use Item/Place Block
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.use}}
|
Place blocks, summon entities with [[spawn egg]]s, toggle [[levers]]/[[door]]s (click once), charge a [[bow]] (release to fire), [[crossbow]], use crossbow, block using a [[shield]], use special blocks like [[chest]]s, [[doors]], and [[lever]]s, enter [[transportation|vehicles]], eat [[food]], drink [[potions]], till [[farmland]], [[shears|shear]] or [[dye]] a [[sheep]], command tamed [[wolves]] and [[cats]] to sit, trade with [[villagers]], place [[fire]] using [[flint and steel]] or a [[fire charge]], name a [[mob]] with a [[name tag]], attach a [[lead]] to an animal or attach an animal on a lead to a [[fence]], cast or reel in a [[fishing rod]], throw a [[splash potion]], [[egg]], [[ender pearl]], [[eye of ender]], [[bottle o' enchanting]], or [[snowball]], equip [[armor]] from the hotbar if the associated armor slot is empty, eating [[cake]], starting a [[furnace minecart]], open [[book and quill]] and [[written book]], use [[debug stick]], add mob in a [[monster spawner]].

Commonly, if both the item held and the block clicked on has a such purpose (like trying to place dirt on a chest), the block overrules the item. This also means a player can punch an entity while eating/drinking, however the eating/drinking resets when a player presses Button 1.

This button also uses items in the off-hand. Only items with a right click function can be used, and they are available only if the item in the main hand does not have a right click action, or its right click action cannot be performed.
|-
! colspan=4 | Inventory
|- id="Drop Selected Item"
| style="font-size: medium; text-align: center" | {{key|Q}}
| style="text-align: center" | Drop Selected Item
| style="text-align: center" | {{cd|key.drop}}
| Drop/toss an item. If [[items]] are stacked, only one gets thrown/tossed/dropped. In recent versions of ''Java Edition'', holding the key causes single items to be dropped quickly from a stack. There is no actual "throw" command; "drop" (default {{Key|Q}}) tosses an [[Item (entity)|object]] approximately 2 to 3 [[blocks]] from the player. [[Egg]]s, [[ender pearl]]s, [[eyes of ender]], and [[snowball]]s can be thrown by the "use" command (default right-clicking). {{key|Control+Q}} drops the whole stack of items.

Note that there is no corresponding '''Pick Up''' command. Dropped items are picked up (if there is room in inventory/hotbar) by moving near them. Placed items are picked up by "mining" (e.g. chopping up a sign with an axe), when they behave as dropped items and can be picked up as such.
|- id="Hotbar Slot"

== ''Bedrock Edition'' ==
{{IN|be}}, there are three control modes available: Keyboard & Mouse, Controller, and Touch. Keyboard & Mouse and Touch controls are not available for Nintendo Switch, although a keyboard can be used for typing and the touchscreen can be used for [[menu screen]]s and [[GUI]]s. All other platforms support any control mode, but the device may not support it by default.

Whenever an input is detected from a different control mode, the game automatically switches to that control mode and enables its [[settings]]. The game launches with the latest selected control mode, or the device default on first launch.

=== Keyboard & Mouse ===
The keyboard and mouse controls are similar to {{JE}}, with a few differences. Most keybinds can be changed in the [[settings]], with a few optional settings related to the controls. Keyboard and mouse controls are unavailable on the Nintendo Switch and require external keyboards on devices without a built-in keyboard and mouse (mobile and consoles).

The game will enter keyboard & mouse mode when it receives a mouse event, but key event won't.{{needs testing|Tested on Windows and Android version, needs testing other versions}}

|-
! width="125" | Default
! In-game option name
! Function
|-
| style="text-align: center" | [[File:Mouse 1.svg|38px|Left click]]
| Attack/Destroy
| Destroys blocks (hold down); Attacks (click once).
|-
| style="text-align: center" | [[File:Mouse 3.svg|38px|Middle click]]
| Pick Block
| Pressing that button while looking at a block or an entity causes the game to attempt placing a corresponding item for the block or entity in the player's hand. For blocks, it is simply the block in item form. For mobs, the game places the corresponding spawn egg in the player's hand. This also works on [[boat]]s, all types of [[minecarts]], and [[paintings]] (not [[armor stand]]s<ref>{{bug|MCPE-90947}}</ref>) to get the entity in item form. If the item is in the hotbar, it switches the selected hotbar slot to the slot with that item. If the item is not in the hotbar, but in the player's inventory, it moves that item from the inventory into the hotbar. If no hotbar slot is empty, the item selected is replaced. In Creative mode without the item in the inventory, the game gives the player that item.

If used on a tile entity while holding {{Key|Control}}, the tile entity's nbt data is copied. The block given to the player has the Lore: "(+DATA)."
|-
| style="text-align: center" | [[File:Mouse 2.svg|38px|Right click]]
| Use Item/Place Block
| Places blocks, interact with [[block]]s, [[entities]], or [[item]]s, equip [[armor]] from the hotbar if the associated armor slot is empty.

=== Controller ===
{{relevant tutorial|Playing with a controller}}
The "Controller" controls for gamepads are similar to the [[Xbox One Edition|''Xbox One'']], [[Nintendo Switch Edition|''Nintendo Switch'']], and [[PlayStation 4 Edition|''PlayStation 4'']] editions, with some differences. All of these controls, except the control sticks and menu controls, can be changed in the [[settings]], as well as some other controller-related options. The Nintendo Switch version can be played with a pair of Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Lite. It cannot be played with a single Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2 controller, as they do not have enough buttons or control sticks. If the gamepad has two control sticks, then the left stick ({{xbtn|thumb-left}}/{{xbtn|seriesthumb-left}}/{{nsbtn|thumb-left}}/{{psbtn|thumb-left}}/{{psbtn|5thumb-left}}) would be used for moving and the right stick ({{xbtn|thumb-right}}/{{xbtn|seriesthumb-right}}/{{nsbtn|thumb-right}}/{{psbtn|thumb-right}}/{{psbtn|5thumb-right}}) would be used for looking. The blank spaces mean that the function is, by default, left unassigned and it is up to the player to assign a button to it. All platforms support gamepads.

=== Touch ===
"Touch" controls for touchscreen devices use controls shown on the [[HUD]]. There are three touch control modes, and an option to split controls, resulting in four actual control modes:
*'''Joystick & tap to interact'''. Drag joystick to move. Drag anywhere else to look around. Tap and hold blocks to interact with them.
*'''Joystick & aim crosshair'''. Drag joystick to move. Drag anywhere else to look around. Aim [[crosshair]] and use buttons to interact with blocks.
*'''D-pad & tap to interact'''. Tap arrows to move. Drag anywhere else to look around. Tap and hold blocks to interact with them.
**'''Split controls''': Aim crosshair and use buttons to interact with blocks.

All control buttons and the joystick can be customized in location, size, and opacity, in the [[settings]], where various other touch control features can be changed.

Menu buttons always appear on the top of the screen regardless of touch control mode.

Touch controls are available on devices with a touchscreen except Nintendo Switch, where the touchscreen can only be used to interact with the hotbar, inventory, and menus. This can also be enabled for other devices.

The game will enter touch mode when it receives a touch event.{{needs testing|Tested on Windows and Android versions, needs testing other versions}}

Note: For Xperia Play owners using the gamepad, while in Creative mode, the lowest two rows of items are beneath the screen, and one cannot scroll down to see them. They are still accessible, but it requires either remembering how many times one has to press the directional buttons to access them, or trial-and-error. This is most prominent in the 4.0 update, as the amount of items has increased, and now sixteen items are hidden. The only way to see them is to turn on the option to use touch controls in the options menu.

==== Notes ====
*On the {{el|psv}} (when playing on the PlayStation Vita), {{el|wii}} (when playing on the Wii U GamePad), and {{el|ns}} (when playing in Tabletop or Handheld mode), the touchscreen can be used to control the tooltips shown at the bottom of the screen (if enabled), as well as the menus and inventory.
** Likewise, on the {{el|ps4}}, the Touch pad can be used to move the inventory cursor as well as control the menus by swiping.
*The {{el|wii}} can be played with a Wii U GamePad, Wii U Pro Controller, Classic Controller, or Classic Controller Pro. It cannot be played with a Wii Remote, Wii Remote Plus, or Nunchuk.
**Note: While the {{el|wii}} can not be played with a Wii Remote or Wii Remote Plus, a Wii Remote or Wii Remote Plus is required to play with a Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.
*The {{el|ns}} can be played with a pair of Joy-Con, the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, or the Nintendo Switch Lite. It cannot be played with a single Joy-Con, as it does not have enough buttons or control sticks.
