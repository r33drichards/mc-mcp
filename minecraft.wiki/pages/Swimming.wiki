'''Swimming''' is a form of [[transportation]] that allows the player to move in water.

== Control ==
[[File:Enter swimming.gif|thumb|right|upright|Entering swim mode.]]
[[File:Exit swimming.gif|thumb|right|upright|Exiting swim mode.]]
Swimming is activated by pressing {{control|forward}} while in [[water]].

Sprint-swimming can also be activated. To do this, the player can press {{control|sprint}} for 1 block gap while moving, or double tap {{control|forward}}. The player cannot sprint-swim if the hunger bar is at {{hunger|6}} or below, or when affected by [[Blindness]].

Sneaking when swimming allows the player to sink faster.

== Usage ==
When swimming on the surface of still water, the player moves at 2.20 blocks per second. If the player is partially submerged in water, the player moves at 1.97 blocks per second. The player moves at 1.81 blocks per second when swimming downstream underwater, and moves at a slower 0.39 blocks per second while swimming upstream underwater.

=== Sprint-swimming ===
[[File:Swim.gif|An animation showing the player sprint-swimming|thumb|250px]]
Sprint-swimming allows the player to move at around 3.918&nbsp;meters/second, which is 10 percent slower than the normal walking speed of around 4.317&nbsp;m/s. The player can turn while sprint-swimming at a slightly reduced speed. Eating, [[blocking]] with a shield or drawing a bow also slows the player down, but doesn't stop the player from spring-swimming.

{{control|Sneaking}} while sprint-swimming allows the player to descend faster, and {{control|jumping}} allows the player to ascend faster. Therefore, the fastest way to descend underwater is to look directly downward, sprint-swim and sneak at the same time, and the fastest way to ascend underwater is to look directly upward, sprint-swim and jump at the same time. While swimming vertically, actions such as eating, blocking or drawing a bow do not slow the player down, unlike when swimming horizontally. 

[[Depth Strider]] increases the player's speed while sprint-swimming. With Depth Strider III, the player can sprint-swim at 5.305&nbsp;meters/second, which is 35% faster than the regular sprint-swimming speed.

Sprint-swimming allows the player to fit through one-block gaps, in a similar method to [[crawling]].<ref>{{ytl|yf-J0FyZo3U}}</ref>

By maneuvering the angle of swimming, it is possible to sprint-swim at the surface of a body of water, while still being able to breathe. 

Sprint-swimming reduces the player's saturation, and upon reaching zero it depletes the [[hunger]] bar at a rate of {{frac|1|2}} every 40 meters, or 7 seconds.

When a player attacks any [[mob]] (excluding [[squid]]) while sprint-swimming, the mob suffers a larger knockback than usual.

Sprint-swimming, unlike normal sprinting, doesn't end when the player collides with a solid block, but it does end when the player attacks a mob. Additionally, sprint-swimming also ends if the hunger bar decreases to {{hunger|6}} or below.

== Trivia ==
* Sprinting and jumping while under a 1 block gap high ceiling causes a player to move at a speed almost twice as fast as regular sprinting speed, but it consumes a hunger point every second.
** This can be sped up even more by decreasing the ceiling height using [[water]] source or by sprinting on [[ice]].
** A similar effect occurs if the player sprints and rapidly hits {{control|swim}} at the same time on a set of fish mobs.
* When affected by [[Dolphin's Grace]]{{only|java}}, a player's speed is increased significantly while swimming.
