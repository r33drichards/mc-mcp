A '''squid''' is a common aquatic [[passive mob]] that [[Mob spawning|spawn]]s in [[river]]s and [[ocean]]s.

== Spawning ==
{{IN|Java}}, 2 to 4 squid can spawn in [[water]] or waterlogged block from [[altitude|Y-level]] 50 to 63 (inclusive), as long as the [[biome]] is a [[river]] or [[ocean]] variant. The block above must also be water, and the block below must be water or waterlogged.<ref group="s" name="water_conditions">
The spawning block and the block below must contain water fluid (water source, flowing water, or waterlogged blocks) while the block above must be water (source or flowing).<br 
/>The squid itself must also pass the collision check. E.g. they can spawn in waterlogged blocks with no collisions such as kelp, sea grass, or signs, but will fail when trying to spawn in a waterlogged slab or above a waterlogged fence.
</ref>
Squid share the water creature [[mob cap]] with [[dolphin]]s and [[nautilus]]es.

{{IN|bedrock}}, 2 to 4 squid can spawn in ocean biomes, and two can spawn in river biomes. In addition, squid spawn only on the surface, i.e. there must not be a solid or spawnable block above the spawn location.

Squid have a 5% chance of spawning as babies.

Unlike other passive baby mobs, killing a baby squid does yield items and experience.{{only|BE}}{{until|BE 26.0}}

== Behavior ==
[[File:Particle squid ink.png|thumb|The ink cloud produced by a squid.]]
Squid are [[passive]] toward the player. They are not attracted to light and do not deliberately interact with the player. Squid sometimes beach themselves and suffocate on the banks of rivers and occasionally on ocean beaches. These behaviors are shared with the glow squid.

Squid wander around aimlessly in three dimensions as long as they are in the water, opening and closing their tentacles, which gives them the appearance of pushing themselves leisurely forward.

A squid's hitbox does not include its tentacles, and therefore they cannot be damaged by attacking its tentacles.

Squid suffocate when out of water, dying after {{convert|15|second|game tick}}. While on land, they remain stationary until they suffocate.<ref>{{bug|MC-240990|||WAI}}</ref> They can take fall damage and [[fire|burn]] like any other land mob, but they cannot drown. When out of the water, squid are extremely resistant to [[knockback]].

Squid cannot swim in lava, even if inflicted with {{EffectLink|Fire Resistance}}. They simply pass through the lava and behave as if on land.

{{IN|be}}, squid can survive on land with {{EffectLink|Water Breathing}}. However, they still cannot move.

Unlike land-based mobs, squid can swim against a current and not get pushed by it.{{only|je}}

[[Guardian]]s and [[elder guardian]]s attack squid in the same manner as they would a player, even if the squid is affected by [[Invisibility]]. [[Axolotl]]s also attack squid.

Squid are affected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment — {{IN|Java}} because they are aquatic mobs; {{IN|Bedrock}} as long as they touch water.

Squid produce a cloud of black ink particles and swim away when attacked. They also produce unique dark blue bubble particles when hit. The ink remains visible when the squid has the {{EffectLink|Invisibility}} status effect.

Squid sometimes accidentally beach themselves.<ref>{{bug|MC-132473||Squids and glow squids can swim one block above water}}</ref>

If the player is in [[Spectator]] mode or is far away from a squid (often when it is in an unloaded [[chunk]]), it remains stationary. When attacked in this state, squid cannot flee.<ref>{{bug|MC-212687||Squid and glow squid stop moving if player is a little far from them}}</ref>

Like land-based mobs, squid can be picked up by a [[minecart]].

Unlike most 'animal' mobs, squid cannot [[breed]]. Baby squid can only be found when they naturally spawn. A baby squid eventually turns into an adult after 24000 ticks (20 minutes), and their growth cannot be sped up.

|Until this version, squid would not despawn like other mobs. This made squid a popular pet as once harvested they could be put in aquariums and kept there.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*When [[Jeb]] first added squid to ''Minecraft'', he used the code for [[cow]]s as a basis for squid. He accidentally forgot to remove the milking feature, which led to squid being able to be milked.<ref>{{ytl|MNOWp8wLNro|Why Is That Squid Flying? Minecraft Bugs Explained!|t=108s}}</ref>
** He also made a mistake in the squid's movement code, causing a server-client desync over the squid's position, which led to the "flying squid" bug.
*Hitting a squid underwater causes it to rise approximately {{fraction|1|3}}–{{fraction|1|2}} block.
*Squid don't have a death animation {{in|java}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-237079||Squid do not rotate 90 degrees upon death}}</ref>
*The squid's idle sound is barely audible.
*{{IN|bedrock}}, if a squid is out of the water, its tentacles swing more slowly as its oxygen meter goes down. When 15 seconds have passed, its tentacles stop swinging and the squid begins to suffocate.
*In-game squid have eight arms, but in real life they also have two additional long tentacles. The in-game squid is more like an octopus.
*In-game squid have a gaping, tooth-lined mouth, but as passive mobs they are completely harmless. Real-life squid, like all cephalopods, have a beak instead of teeth.
*{{IN|java}}, squid are not affected by the "Dinnerbone" and "Grumm" [[name tag]] easter egg.<ref>{{bug|MC-115092||Squid/glow squid named "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" is not upside-down}}</ref>
*According to minecraft education, squid ink is actually [[W:ferrous sulfate|ferrous sulfate]], unlike real squid ink which is mostly mucus and melanin.
