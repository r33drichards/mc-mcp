== Description ==
Like all other hills biomes, giant tree taiga hills featured elevated, hillier terrain compared to the tegular {{Abbr|giant tree taiga|now known as old growth pine taiga}}, making the landscape less suitable for shelter. In any other aspect, the giant tree taiga hills generated the same way as the regular giant tree taiga. Podzol, coarse dirt, and rocks all generated on the hills. Wolves, foxes and rabbits{{only|je}} spawned here.

== Mobs ==
Giant tree taiga hills used the same mob spawning chances as giant tree taigas. 

The following mobs naturally spawned here:
