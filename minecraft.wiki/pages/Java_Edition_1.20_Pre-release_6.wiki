'''1.20 Pre-release 6''' (known as '''1.20-pre6''' in the launcher) is the sixth pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.20]], released on May 25, 2023,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-20-pre-release-5|Minecraft 1.20 Pre-Release 6|May 25, 2023}}</ref> which fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]'''
* "Smithing with Style" is now a challenge advancement.

=== General ===
'''[[Loot table]]'''
* The ID of the random sequence is now an optional field. If no sequence name is given, loot is drawn using a non-deterministic random source.

'''[[Recipe]]'''
* {{cd|"item": "minecraft:air"}} can no longer be used in data pack recipes.
* Ingredients in array form are now also allowed in {{cd|d=and|smithing_trim|smithing_transform}} recipes on fields template, base and addition.
** Those fields also allow empty arrays, which signalize that slot needs to be left empty.
