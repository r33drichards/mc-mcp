'''1.14 Pre-Release 2''' is the second pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on April 12, 2019,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-14-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.14 Pre-Release 2|April 12, 2019}}</ref> which adds 2 new [[advancement]]s, a new Mouse Settings menu and increases performance.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added 2 new advancements:
** ''Voluntary Exile'' – Kill a [[raid captain]].
** ''Hero of the Village'' – Successfully defend a [[village]] from a [[raid]].

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Illager banner]]'''
* Renamed to ominous banner.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Sensitivity, invert mouse and touchscreen mode have been moved to a subsection "mouse settings".
* Added new options scroll sensitivity and discrete scrolling, also in "mouse settings"; these fix {{bug|MC-123773}}.
** Scroll sensitivity is a multiplier for scroll magnitude; the setting was first added in [[18w21a]] but was only accessible by editing <code>mouseWheelSensitivity</code> in [[options.txt]].
** Discrete scrolling tells the game to ignore scroll magnitude values given by the operating system and instead to act as if the operating system supplied &minus;1 or +1. <!-- i.e. signum(input) --> These will be influenced by the sensitivity afterward if needed.
** If unwanted scrolling occurs, enable discrete scrolling and set the sensitivity to 1.

'''Performance'''
* Improved performance.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Added new statistics:
** Bells rung
** Interactions with cartography table
** Interactions with loom
** Interactions with stonecutter
** Raids triggered
** Raids won
