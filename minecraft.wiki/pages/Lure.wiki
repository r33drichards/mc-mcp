'''Lure''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[fishing rod]]s that decreases the wait time for bites when fishing.

== Obtaining ==
Lure can be obtained from [[enchanting tables]], drops from mobs that have spawned in a [[raid]]{{only|bedrock}}, books obtained by [[fishing]], [[monster room]] chests, librarian [[villager]]s, and non-village [[structure]] loot.

== Usage ==
In [[Java Edition]], Lure increases the rate of something biting the [[player]]'s hook while [[fishing]]. Specifically, it decreases the wait time for something to appear by 5 seconds per level. See [[Fishing]] for more information.

If [[commands]] are used to increase the enchantment level beyond 5, the wait timer does not start and fish do not bite.

In [[Bedrock Edition]], Lure increases the chance of catching fish at the cost of reeling in treasure or junk, as it was before [[Java Edition 1.9]].
