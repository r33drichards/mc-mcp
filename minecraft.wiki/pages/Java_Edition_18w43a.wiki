== Trivia ==
* The first snapshot of [[Java Edition 1.13]], [[17w43a]], was released in the same week of the year as 18w43a.
* In the [[minecraft.net]] blog post introducing 18w43a, [[Adrian Östergård]] captioned the section describing loom using the phrase "Bröther, may I have some lööm?". This is a reference to the [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cats-wanting-fruit-loops cat wanting fruit loops] internet meme.
* 18w43a holds the record as having the most content in one developmental release, adding nearly 3 times as much content as the entirety of [[Java Edition 1.4.2]] did in October 2012.
** The previous record for most content added in one developmental release was held by [[15w31a]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]].
* As with [[18w43b]], 18w43a was released exactly 6 years after the [https://bugs.mojang.com Minecraft issue tracker].
