'''''Minecraft: PlayStation Vita Edition''''' is the {{el|lce}} version of ''[[Minecraft]]'' for the {{w|PlayStation Vita}} and {{w|PlayStation TV}} in development by [[4J Studios]] for and alongside [[Mojang Studios]].<ref>{{tweet|4JStudios|370111405216649216|Happy to confirm we're developing Minecraft PS3, PS4 & PS Vita Editions for Mojang, as well as Xbox 360 & Xbox One Editions!|August 21, 2013}}</ref> A hidden teaser was hinted by 4J Studios on {{w|Twitter}} in April 2014 where a PlayStation Vita displaying ''Minecraft'' in the background of the main focus of the image could be seen,<ref>{{tweet|4JStudios|454533121040334848|Perfect Dark XBLA is on sale at 70% off just now!

Here's a screenshot.|May 12, 2014}}</ref> Following the announcement, [[Jens Bergensten]] (Jeb) also added that it was based on {{el|ps3}}.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|465877758707769344|MC:Vita screenshot! (It's based on the PS3 Edition)|May 12, 2014}}</ref>

The {{el|ps3}} also has some level of connectivity with the ''PlayStation Vita Edition''; the game at the PlayStation Store incorporates the so-called {{w|PlayStation Network#Cross-buy|Cross-Buy}} feature, which makes players get one of the two editions for free when purchasing either one of them. Saved worlds were also transferable between the consoles.<ref>http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2674931-snapshot-14w21b-ready-for-testing-xbone-ps-news</ref>

Compared to the ''[[PlayStation 3 Edition]]'', ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' only supports multiplayer for up to 4 players'','' and the [[Render distance|render]] and [[Simulation distance|simulation]] distance was reduced to 5 [[Chunk|chunks]]. [[Splitscreen/Legacy Console Edition|Splitscreen]] is not included, but the ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' supports local multiplayer via an {{w|ad-hoc network}}. 

The ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' became available for purchase on the PlayStation Network on October 14 in North America and on October 15 in Europe.<ref>{{tweet|4JStudios|519987042139525120|#MinecraftPSVita passed final test and will be released on 15th October in Europe!|October 8, 2014}}</ref> It had a retail release in stores on November 11 (North America),<ref>{{tweet|PlayStation|520567552490352641|Minecraft PS Vita Edition hits PS Store on Tuesday!

As of [[PlayStation Vita Edition 1.84|1.84]], the ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' has not received new feature updates, such as [[Village & Pillage]], [[Buzzy Bees]], the [[Nether Update]], [[Caves & Cliffs]], and so on.
The ''PlayStation Vita Edition'''s most recent feature update is the [[Update Aquatic]].<ref>https://minecraft.net/article/update-aquatic-coming-legacy-console-editions</ref>

Update 1.84 removed the ability to transfer saves from PS3, PS Vita, and PS TV systems to PS4, and fixed some bugs.<ref name="save">"[https://minecraft.net/article/enjoy-saving-your-playstation-game- Enjoy saving your PlayStation game? | Minecraft]" Sofia Dankis, April 4, 2020</ref>

== Gameplay ==
{{Main|Legacy Console Edition#Gameplay}}

== Changes ==
Through Sony's "Cross Buy" initiative, owners of ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' are able to download ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' at no additional cost. Since the ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' is based on the ''PlayStation 3 Edition'', saves on the ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' are compatible with ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' and vice versa via an online upload to PlayStation Network.

This does not apply to {{el|ps4}}. It was only possible to do a one-way save transfer from PS3 to PS4. As of April 15, 2020, it is no longer possible to transfer saves from PS3 to PS Vita/PS TV and vice versa.<ref name="save" /> There was also a major discount for previous owners of the ''PlayStation 3 Edition'', however, since February 25, 2016, there is no longer such a discount on ''PlayStation 4 Edition'' for owners of the ''PlayStation 3 Edition''.

== Trivia ==
* As production of PlayStation Vita cartridges have been discontinued,<ref>[https://polygon.com/2018/5/16/17360062/vita-physical-games-discontinued Sony is shutting down production of physical Vita games] - Polygon; May 18, 2019</ref> the only legal way to purchase the ''PlayStation Vita Edition'' is to buy the game digitally via the PlayStation Store. Another option is to order a physical copy from re-sellers from websites like eBay and Amazon, but buying a digital copy may be more viable.
** The physical copy released in North America included a download code for the game instead of a physical cartridge. These codes expired on March 31, 2017.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWh5NsMadaU&ab_channel=Bearman3600</ref>
* The popularity of this version of Minecraft in Japan produced a bundle with a Minecraft-themed backplate on the PlayStation Vita console, along with a downloadable Minecraft voucher, and a Minecraft-themed carrying case for the PS Vita.<ref>[https://www.gematsu.com/2016/11/minecraft-ps-vita-models-announced-japan Minecraft PS Vita models announced for Japan] - Gematsu; November 14, 2016</ref>
* When traveling in The Nether on PlayStation Vita Edition, Overworld distances are scaled down by a ratio of 3:1 rather than 8:1.
