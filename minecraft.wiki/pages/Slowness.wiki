'''Slowness''' is a [[status effect]] that decreases [[walking]] speed. As such, it is also the opposite of [[Speed]].

== Effect ==
Slowness reduces movement speed. Movement includes [[walking]], [[sprinting]], [[sneaking]], [[crawling]], and [[swimming]]. If a player or mob is [[riding]] another mob, slowness only reduces the speed of the ridden mob if that mob has the effect. The speed of the rider does not matter.

Slowness decreases movement speed by 15% × ''level'' and contracts the player's field of view accordingly. [[Status effect#negativelevels|Negative levels]] of Slowness increase movement speed.

[[Jumping]], [[Entity#Motion of entities|falling]], [[climbing]], [[flying]], and any motion that is not caused directly the [[player]] or [[mob]] with slowness, are not effected by slowness. i.e. the player or mob will jump / fall / etc. at the same speed as normal.

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to the Slowness effect.
*Flying mobs and [[Shulker]]s are unaffected by the Slowness effect.<ref>{{bug|MC-40949}} - Flying mobs do not obey generic.movementSpeed attribute</ref>.

== Notes ==
* A weapon enchanted with [[Bane of Arthropods]] inflicts Slowness IV on [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, [[silverfish]], [[endermite]]s and [[bee]]s; duration is dependent on the enchantment level.
* Levels 7 and above render the player unable to move unless jumping while throwing an [[ender pearl]].
* Alternative methods of reducing travel speed include: walking on [[soul sand]]s, [[slime block]]s, or [[honey block]]s, or through [[sweet berry bush|berry bushes]] or [[cobweb]]s; [[swimming]]; riding a [[boat]] on land; [[sneaking]]; eating; drinking [[honey bottle]], [[milk]] or a [[potion]] (travel speed is reduced while drinking ''any'' potion, regardless of the effects of the potion after drinking is finished); aiming a [[trident]] or [[bow]], charging [[crossbow]] and blocking with a [[shield]].
