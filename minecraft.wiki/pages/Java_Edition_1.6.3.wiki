'''1.6.3''' is the first and only pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.6.4]].<ref>{{tweet|dinner|378475393772445696|Snapshot 13w37b and Prerelease 1.6.3 have both just been released. Go get them! https://mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w37a/|13 Sep 2013}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/09/minecraft-snapshot-13w37a/</ref> It was released to provide a fix to allow structures to be saved with the world file.

1.6.3 was reuploaded on September 17, 2013.{{more info}}

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* {{bug|MC-15547}} – Structures (witch huts, nether fortresses etc.) do not get saved with the world file.
** In order for current structures (witch huts, nether fortresses, etc.) to be saved to the world file, the player must load the appropriate chunks within the game manually. The game ''will not'' automatically scan worlds and update structure data globally. After this is completed, structures will be compatible in all snapshots starting with snapshot [[13w37b]].
* Fixed a handshake exploit.</onlyinclude>
* Removed browser compatibility. (The .jar file cannot be ran on a browser JVM.)

== Trivia ==
* The pre-reupload of this version was released on the same day as [[13w37b]].
