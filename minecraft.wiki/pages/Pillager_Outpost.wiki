{{relevant tutorial|Defeating a pillager outpost}}

A '''pillager outpost''' is an assortment of [[Structure|generated structure]]s inhabited by [[pillager]]s.

== Generation ==
Pillager outposts are semi-rare structures, generating every several hundred to couple thousand blocks.<ref>https://chunkbase.com/apps/pillager-outpost-finder</ref> This makes them rarer than [[village]]s<ref>https://chunkbase.com/apps/village-finder</ref> but less rare than [[woodland mansion]]s.

Pillager outposts can generate naturally in any village-generating biome, including:

* {{BiomeLink|Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Desert}}
* {{BiomeLink|Savanna}}
* {{BiomeLink|Taiga}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* {{BiomeLink|Sunflower Plains}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
* {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
Pillager outposts also generate in the following biomes, where villages do not spawn:
* {{BiomeLink|Grove}}
* {{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes}}
* {{BiomeLink|Jagged Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Frozen Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Stony Peaks}}
* {{BiomeLink|Cherry Grove}}

{{IN|Java}}, pillager outposts never generate too close to, or within, villages. They can do so {{in|bedrock}} as well as generate far away from villages.

{{IN|Java}}, if an outpost spawns in the water or in the air (e.g., spawning near a [[savanna plateau]]), then a platform of [[grass block|grass]] (or [[sand]]), [[dirt]], and [[stone]] spawns underneath it in a circular shape. This also applies to the smaller structures such as tents, targets, [[log]] piles, and cages. On occasion, the smaller structures still spawn in the air despite having a platform below them, depending on how high up they are.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, pillager outposts generate with foundations similar to that of a woodland mansion: watchtowers use [[cobblestone]], birch [[planks]], and dark oak logs as their foundation; tents and cages generate dark oak planks as their foundation; log piles use horizontal dark oak logs as their foundation; and targets generate cobblestone as a foundation.

The outpost tower generates each time. Up to 4 other smaller structures may spawn around the periphery of the main outpost structure.

Eight extra [[air]] blocks also generate around the outpost, inside of the ground, creating small trenches.<ref>{{bug|MC-139711||Jigsaw block creates holes in the ground when generating pillager outposts}}</ref>

Iron golems and allays spawn only during the generation of the outpost structures. An iron golem has a 85% chance of spawning. Meanwhile, the allay has a 50% chance of spawning. These mobs spawn in cages. The iron golem can punch pillagers who are one block away from the fences of the cage. 

Both regular pillagers and [[pillager captain]]s can continuously spawn around the structure. Pillagers can still spawn if a player is inside the tower. {{IN|Java}}, they spawn in a 72×54×72 area centered on the top level of the watchtower, the same level as the chest.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, pillagers spawn at the highest available position in up to 4 columns depending on which direction the structure generates. The number of spawning locations vary based on the orientation of the structure: 2 spots when the door is facing east/west (50%), 4 for north (25%), and 1 for south (25%). The first spawning column is one block diagonally toward the chest at the top from the center of the structure; the other possible 3 are 8 blocks east, south, and southeast of the first. Pillagers can spawn in these columns, beginning from the bottom floor and extending vertically up to 18 blocks. Pillagers spawn on the northwest corner of a block and require a clear 2×2×2 area for spawning. Any solid block in this region inhibits spawning, while transparent blocks like leaves or glass don't impede spawning if they aren't positioned on the actual spawning spot.
[[File:PillagerOutpost SpawnBlock Bedrock.png|thumb|Pillagers always spawn on the red block in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''. Note that the entrance is at the bottom of this image.]]

[[File:Pillager spawn request.jpeg|thumb|Pillagers have a higher chance of spawning if there are more blocks where mobs spawn (e.g. ice, grass block, bedrock).]]
Additionally, pillagers can also spawn on spots in the outbuildings of the outpost. The spawning spots are either level with, or one block above the generated floor of the outbuilding. Extending the floor of an outbuilding outside the originally generated boundary of the floor can sometimes reveal additional spawning spots.

{{IN|Java}}, only pillagers may spawn within a pillager outpost spawn area. Pillagers may naturally spawn on any valid opaque block (except leaves) as long as the block light level is 8 or less. They cannot, however, spawn on blocks that emit a light level of 14 or greater. There is a 6% chance for a pillager to spawn as a patrol leader.

{{IN|Java}}, there are 15 jigsaw blocks that can generate the structures around the tower. Each structure has a 1 in 13 chance of being generated, including allay and iron golem cages. When generated, iron golem cages spawn one golem, and allay cages spawn two allays.

A total of eight pillagers, including the pillager captain, spawns in a pillager outpost.

=== Bad Omen ===
Upon killing an outpost captain, it drops an [[Ominous Bottle]] of a random level between 1 and 5. Drinking it causes the [[player]] to receive the corresponding level of the [[Bad Omen]] effect, active for 100 minutes (5 in-game days).

== Structure ==
{{main|/Structure}}
A pillager outpost consists of a 4-story watchtower with other smaller structures around it.

[[Structure block]]s can be used to manually load pieces of the pillager outpost from the {{cd|/data/minecraft/structures/pillager_outpost}} folder in [[minecraft.jar]]. To do so, set a structure block to Load mode, enter {{cd|pillager_outpost/''<structure_name>''}}, and press LOAD.
