== Changes ==
{{info needed section|visual differences in the tooltip background compared to the previous snapshot}}
=== Items ===
'''[[Ender pearl]]'''

* Ender Pearls now ensure that the chunk they are in or travel into is always loaded and ticking.
* They also load chunks when crossing to a new dimension, so that they can always continue to travel.
* This ensures that Ender Pearls can always land, and makes cross dimensional ender pearl traveling more predictable.
* Ender Pearls now unload when a player logs out, and reappear whenever that player logs back in, similar to how mounts currently behave
* Each Ender Pearl creates a ticket for chunk loading any time it moves into a new chunk, and also periodically every 10 seconds.

=== Mobs ===

*** When present, it is used to generate containing stack name.
*** For example, if value is <code>foo</code> and item is <code>minecraft:lingering_potion</code>, the name of item is translation of <code>item.minecraft.lingering_potion.effect.foo</code>.
