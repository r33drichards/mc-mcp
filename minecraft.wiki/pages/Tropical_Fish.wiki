'''Tropical fish''' are common [[Bucket of aquatic mob|bucketable]] aquatic [[passive mob]]s found in warm or lukewarm [[ocean]]s, [[mangrove swamp]]s and [[lush caves]]. There are 2,700 naturally occurring variants of tropical fish of different colors and shapes with unique names {{in|bedrock}} and 3,072 {{in|java}}.<ref name="MC-261096"/>

== Spawning ==
{{IN|java}}, random varieties of tropical fish spawn in groups of 8 in [[Lukewarm Ocean|lukewarm]] or [[Warm Ocean|warm]] oceans (as well as their deep variants) and [[mangrove swamp]]s at Y-level 50 to 63, and in [[lush caves]] in aquifers at any Y-level. They are subject to [[Fish#Spawning|fish spawning requirements]].

{{IN|bedrock}}, tropical fish spawn underwater at 12-32 blocks away from the player. Tropical fish spawn only in [[Warm Ocean|warm]], [[Lukewarm Ocean|lukewarm]], [[Deep Lukewarm Ocean|deep lukewarm]] ocean biomes; [[lush caves]], in groups of 3-5 for the same preset pattern, and in groups of 1-3 for a random pattern; and mangrove swamps. In addition, tropical fish in warm, lukewarm, and deep ocean variants can spawn only at Y levels between 50 and 64 and must be on the surface (i.e., there must not be a spawnable block above the spawn location with a non-solid block on top). Tropical fish in lush caves can spawn on aquifers at any Y levels but require underground.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===

|{{DropLine|name=Bone|edition=bedrock|dropchance=25%|lootingchance=1%|lootingquantity=1-2}}
}}
* {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
Tropical fish tend to swim in schools of fish with a maximum of 7 tropical fish per school. Tropical fish are also able to go against the water flow.

The player may collect a tropical fish by {{control|using}} a [[water bucket]] on it, which gives the player a [[bucket of tropical fish]]. {{control|Using}} that fish bucket against a block empties the bucket, placing water with that fish swimming in it. Tropical fish placed via buckets do not despawn naturally.

Tropical fish cannot be bred, but only spawn in designated biomes.

=== Weaknesses ===
Tropical fish cannot survive out of water. Outside of water, they flop around for a while until eventually they suffocate and die. {{IN|bedrock}}, they rotate when flipping. Fish cannot swim or breathe in cauldron water.<ref>{{bug|MC-126819}} – "fish bouncing and suffocating on top of the cauldron which fills with water" resolved as "Won't Fix"</ref>

Fish have a weakness to weapons that have the [[Impaling]] enchantment, which also affects [[squid]], [[turtle]]s, [[guardian]]s, [[elder guardian]]s, and [[dolphin]]s.{{only|java}}

== Varieties ==
[[File:Wild Tropical Fish Variants.png|thumb|300px|The 22 uniquely-named varieties of tropical fish in ''Java Edition''. From top to bottom and left to right:
<ol><li>Anemone, Black Tang, Blue Tang, Butterflyfish, Cichlid, Clownfish</li>
<li>Cotton Candy Betta, Dottyback, Emperor Red Snapper, Goatfish, Moorish Idol, Ornate Butterflyfish</li>
<li>Parrotfish, Queen Angelfish, Red Cichlid, Red Lipped Blenny, Red Snapper, Threadfin</li>
<li>Tomato Clownfish, Triggerfish, Yellowtail Parrotfish, Yellow Tang</li></ol>]]
[[File:All Tropical Fish variants.png|thumb|300px|All possible tropical fish variants.]]

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
When tropical fish spawn in the wild, 90% of the time they appear as schools of one of the 22 varieties seen on the right, and the other 10% of the time their patterns, shape, and colors are completely random, drawn from any of 2 shapes, 6 patterns, 16 base colors, and 16 pattern colors. The color black is not supposed to appear on any naturally-spawned tropical fish, since the eyes are usually hard to see<ref name="Black">{{bug|MC-169763||Black-colored tropical fish never spawn naturally or using spawn eggs|WAI}}</ref>, but due to a bug<ref name="MC-261096">{{bug|MC-261096||Tropical fish spawn with black colors since 1.19.3}}</ref> black can be chosen randomly. This results in 3,072 naturally-occurring combinations, instead of the intended 2,880.

Tropical fish can be [[summoned]] with black as one or both of their colors, and/or without any visible pattern,{{more info|How is this done? Put it in the data values section below}} though even without the pattern they can still have a pattern color, causing a further 884 possible combinations, 480 of which look the same due to the missing pattern.

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
Tropical fish do not have common varieties {{in|bedrock}}. Instead, naturally spawned tropical fish have 2 spawn attempts: the first chooses one of the 22 preset variants, and the other uses randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black).
Tropical fish spawned from a spawn egg use randomly chosen patterns, sizes, shapes, and colors (except black).
By using commands, tropical fish may be spawned as one of the 22 preset variants (due to {{bug|MCPE-117477}}, Yellowtail Parrot Fish do not spawn, therefore only 21 preset variants exist on Bedrock Edition).

=== Names ===
<onlyinclude>Tropical fish variants in buckets have names that are assigned based on their colors and type. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the names are in the name of the bucket, giving names like "Bucket of Dottyback", "Bucket of Sky-Orange Snooper", or "Bucket of Orange-Lime Dasher". {{IN|Java}}, the type, and colors are displayed as additional lines in the item tooltip. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, the following colors are renamed from their defaults when they refer to tropical fish. Parentheses indicate default name and color id - see {{slink||Entity data}}.
* {{BlockLink|Light Blue Concrete|link=none|text=Sky}} (Light Blue; 3)
* {{BlockLink|Pink Concrete|link=none|text=Rose}} (Pink; 6)
* {{BlockLink|Light Gray Concrete|link=none|text=Silver}} (Light Gray; 8)
* {{BlockLink|Cyan Concrete|link=none|text=Teal}} (Cyan; 9)
* {{BlockLink|Purple Concrete|link=none|text=Plum}} (Purple; 10)

The base color is first, and the pattern color is next if it is different.

The fish type is determined according to the shape and pattern of the fish:

Some varieties of tropical fish don't follow the normal naming system; instead, they reference real-life fish species. {{IN|Java}}, these unique fish are limited to the 22 common varieties. {{IN|Bedrock}}, there are also 22 uniquely-named tropical fish, though they are not all the same as {{in|Java}}. These uniquely-named tropical fish aren't different from regular tropical fish in terms of design or behavior.

These varieties are:
