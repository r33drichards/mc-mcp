'''Trees''' are common living plant [[feature]]s found in many biomes that mainly consist of [[log]]s and [[leaves]].

== Structure ==
[[File:Arrangement of all tree types.png|thumb|500px|Various trees found in ''[[Minecraft]]'']]
Trees vary widely in height, from a bare minimum of 1 log block for jungle bushes, ranging up to a maximum of 30 blocks for mega jungle trees.

Tree canopies are composed of leaf blocks and grow 1 block higher than the highest log block (except those of the fancy oak, whose leaves grow 3 blocks higher). The canopy may begin from the ground and go up to 6 blocks from the ground. Tree canopies are generated from roughly spherical clusters of leaves about 5–7 blocks across, centered on sections of trunk or branches. Leaves must be supported by an adjacent trunk (or leaf blocks connected to the trunk); otherwise, they disappear.

Fancy oak, dark oak, and mega jungle trees grow branches (logs connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree has between one and six branches, and each branch has between one and six logs. Acacia tree branches do not cover their branches in this way.{{info needed|How do acacia branches work?}} Regular oak, jungle, birch, spruce, pine, mega spruce, and mega pine lack branches.

== Growth and characteristics ==
{{See also|Tutorial:Tree farming}}
[[File:Jungle tree growth example.png|alt=|left|thumb|This jungle tree cannot grow because of the red wool block (looking southeast from the northwestern corner).]]
Trees are created when [[chunk]]s are generated, and can also be grown from [[sapling]]s.

Tree saplings have a {{frac|1|20}} chance ({{frac|1|40}} if they are jungle saplings) of dropping from [[leaf]] blocks when they decay or are destroyed. There are eight species of saplings, corresponding to seven trees: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, acacia, dark oak, cherry and pale oak.

[[File:UndergroundTree.png|thumb|A tree that was grown in a cave, with the necessary light provided by [[torch]]es.]]

The sapling can be planted on any variant of [[dirt]], (except [[dirt path]]) a [[moss block]], or [[mud]], and must have a [[light]] level of at least 8 in the sapling block.<!-- a light level of at least 9 in the block directly above the sapling (making the light in the sapling block at least 8, depending on torch placement)--> 

<!--This is not true as of 1.17.
{{IN|java}}, acacia saplings do not grow on farmland and 2×2 trees cannot be grown when the NW sapling is on farmland.
-->
A sapling uproots with light level 7 or less in the sapling block itself unless it has a view of the sky that is unobstructed (except by [[glass]] or [[Opacity|other transparent materials]]). The sapling must have at least 6 blocks of space above it to grow; the amount of required space varies between the different species of trees. A ceiling above sapling limits the ''maximum'' height of the tree that can grow from that sapling. However, dirt blocks and logs may not prohibit tree growth, and in some cases may be replaced as a sapling attempts to grow through them. However {{in|BE}}, logs prohibit tree growth.

If multiple saplings are planted next to each other, each one grows as long as the leaves from the other grown saplings do not block too much of the sunlight. Artificial light (torches, etc.) can still be used to grow them if this happens.

[[File:CaveTree.png|thumb|Trees can be generated anywhere where there is light and dirt.]]
All trees in the active [[chunk]] radius around the player make attempts to grow at random intervals. For any given tree this can work out to about one growth attempt per minute. When a tree attempts to grow, it first checks that it has enough light, then randomly chooses which variant of that species of tree to become; for example, an oak sapling chooses to grow as either a normal or fancy oak.

Once a tree has passed a light check and chosen size to attempt, it checks if there is enough space for its chosen size. If it encounters an obstruction during this check, it fails to grow and must wait for the next pass before it can attempt to grow again. This means that a tree in an open field with enough light grows relatively quickly, but a tree in a cramped tree farm that stunts its size may make several attempts before finally growing.

[[Bone meal]], when {{control|used}} on a sapling, has a chance of forcing it to grow, so long as all of the normal checks (light, space, dirt, etc.) have passed. It does not ''guarantee'' growth, but forces an ''attempt'' to grow.

[[File:NetherTrees.png|thumb|Planting trees in the Nether]]
All saplings grow normally in [[the Nether]] and in [[the End]], although they must be planted in [[dirt]] transported from the [[Overworld]] and provided with sufficient light and space. Leaf blocks in the Nether have the same color as if they were placed in a [[desert]] biome. In the End, they are a dull bluish-green, as in the [[windswept hills]] biome.

In order to grow a 2×2 tree (be it spruce, jungle, dark oak, or pale oak), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, there must be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western side up to the final height of the tree. The [[bone meal]] can be used on any of the saplings. The largest mega jungle trees, mega spruces, and mega pines reach 31 blocks tall. Dark oaks are typically 6–8 blocks tall.

Leaves and logs removed from a tree do not grow back over time.

When a sapling on a grass block or mycelium or moss block grows into a tree, the block the sapling was planted on is instantly converted to dirt.

== Types of trees ==
{{See also|Tree/Structure}}
There are ten types of trees – [[oak]], [[spruce]], [[birch]], [[jungle tree]], [[acacia]], [[dark oak]], [[azalea tree]], [[mangrove]], [[cherry]], and [[pale oak]].

Other structures are loosely defined as trees: the [[huge fungus]], [[huge mushroom]], and [[chorus plant]].

=== Oak ===
{{main|Oak|Swamp Oak}}
Oaks are among the most common trees in the game. They have the smallest space requirements, and along with [[dark oak]] trees, they can drop an [[apple]] when a leaf block is destroyed. In [[swamp]] biomes, a slightly larger variant of the regular oak with [[vines]] called the swamp oak is generated, which can naturally generate in shallow water. Fancy oaks may also grow or generate in place of regular oaks; these are taller and may feature branches. A rare variant is its smallest configuration, colloquially known as a "balloon" oak. Normal oaks can also generate in the [[trial chambers]] and they're all the same type with a single [[dirt]] underneath and a single [[water]] next to it. When near [[flowers]] oak trees may generate with a [[bee nest]].

=== Dark oak ===
{{main|Dark oak}}
Dark oaks are found in the [[dark forest]] biome. They have thick 2×2 trunks. A dark oak always generates with dirt blocks under its trunk, even on a steep cliff. Irregular logs, representing large branches, are nearly always present and connected to the trunk. The canopy of a dark oak filters enough light that a dense forest of them is sufficiently dark for hostile mobs to spawn during the daytime.

</gallery>

=== Spruce ===
{{main|Spruce}}
Spruce trees grow from spruce saplings and have growth patterns and requirements similar to birch trees, although they appear different. They are mainly found in the [[taiga]] biome, but they may also generate in [[windswept forest]], [[snowy plains]], [[snowy taiga]], and [[old growth taiga]] biomes. Spruce logs have the same texture as oak logs, but it is a darker shade of brown; its leaves are denser, with a darker and more bluish tone.

</gallery>

=== Birch ===
{{main|Birch}}
Birch trees look fairly similar to small oaks in terms of height and are most commonly found in [[birch forest]] biomes. There are two types of birch: a shorter tree that can be grown by the player with birch saplings; and a taller, rarer variety that generates only naturally in [[Old Growth Birch Forest|old growth birch forest]] biomes. When near [[flowers]] birch trees may generate with a [[bee nest]].

<gallery widths="100px">
File:Birch Tree.png|A birch
File:Tall Birch Tree.png|A tall birch
</gallery>

=== Jungle ===
{{main|Jungle tree|Jungle Bush}}
Jungle trees are one of the rarest naturally generated trees in Minecraft because they are native to the [[jungle]] biomes, which are themselves rare. Jungle tree leaves drop jungle tree saplings. When planted in grass or dirt they grow into a jungle tree with a 1×1 trunk, but the [[player]] can place them in a 2×2 formation to grow a large jungle tree with a 2×2 trunk like the trees found naturally in the jungle biome. Jungle bushes also generate in the jungle biome, featuring a single jungle log surrounded by oak leaves.

<gallery widths="100px">

File:Jungle Bush.png|A jungle bush
</gallery>

=== Acacia ===
{{main|Acacia}}
Acacias are found in the [[savanna]] biome. They are about 8 blocks tall and feature unique diagonal trunks, and may occasionally have multiple canopies.

File:Single-canopy Acacia Tree.png|A variant of acacia with a single canopy
</gallery>

=== Azalea ===
{{main|Azalea Tree}}
Azalea trees generate on any empty space above a [[lush cave]], with roots consisting of [[rooted dirt]] and [[hanging roots]] that reach down to the lush cave. The tree usually appears at the surface, but they can generate inside caves if there is enough room and a lush cave below.

Azalea trees can be manually grown by applying bone meal to an [[azalea]] or [[flowering azalea]] block ("bush"). Unlike most trees, they do not have their own wood type (the trunks are composed of oak logs), but they have two types of leaf block: [[azalea leaves]], and [[flowering azalea leaves]].

<gallery widths="100px">
File:Azalea Tree.png|An azalea tree
</gallery>

=== Mangrove ===
{{main|Mangrove}}

Mangroves are found in muddy [[mangrove swamp]]s, growing in water or on land. They are grown from [[propagule]]s, which can be found hanging from the trees. A mangrove converts any mud around it to [[muddy mangrove roots]]. The wood has a deep red-orange color.

<gallery widths="100px">
File:Mangrove Tree.png|A mangrove
</gallery>

=== Cherry ===
{{main|Cherry}}

Cherry trees are found in [[cherry grove]]s. They have distinct pink leaves and curved branches. They also have a unique petal falling particle effect. They may occasionally have multiple canopies. When near [[flowers]] they may generate with a [[bee nest]].<gallery>
Cherry Tree.png|A cherry tree
</gallery>

=== Pale Oak ===
{{main|Pale Oak}}

Pale oaks are found in [[pale garden]]s. They have thick 2×2 trunks and gray leaves with a leaf-shaped falling particle effect. They generate with [[pale hanging moss]] on some leaves, naturally generated pale oaks also may contain a [[creaking heart]].<gallery>
Pale Oak Tree.png|A pale oak
</gallery>

=== Huge fungus ===
{{main|Huge fungus}}
Huge fungi come in many shapes and sizes, from really small to really huge. Their trunks are composed of "stem" blocks which are nearly identical to wooden logs, except for being non-flammable.  In place of leaves they have [[nether wart block]]s or warped wart blocks, with occasional [[shroomlight]]s embedded within them.  Crimson huge fungi often generate with [[weeping vine]]s.  

Huge crimson fungi are found in the [[crimson forest]] biome; huge warped fungi are found in the [[warped forest]] biome.

They can be grown from crimson or warped [[Nether Fungus|fungus]], placed on [[crimson nylium]] or [[warped nylium]].  To grow into a huge fungus, the original fungus must be planted on the matching type of nylium, and then bone meal applied to it.

<gallery widths="100px">
File:Huge Crimson fungi.png|A huge crimson fungus.
File:Huge Warped fungi.png|A huge warped fungus.
</gallery>

=== Huge mushroom ===
{{main|Huge mushroom}}
While loosely defined as a tree, these are [[features]] generated in certain biomes. Instead of logs and leaves, they consist of mushroom stems and mushroom blocks, which don't decay. When harvested without [[Silk Touch]], they drop [[mushroom]]s.
They come in two variants, brown and red.

<gallery widths="100px">
File:Huge Red Mushroom.png|A huge red mushroom.
File:Huge Brown Mushroom.png|A huge brown mushroom.
</gallery>

=== Chorus plant ===
{{main|Chorus plant}}
While loosely defined as a tree, these are [[features]] generated on the outermost End islands. Instead of logs and leaves, they are instead comprised of chorus plant trunk blocks and flowers on the tip. They do not drop their own block but instead [[chorus fruit]].
They are usually extremely tall, with multiple branches. When the bottom of the chorus tree is cut, the whole chorus tree falls apart, dropping their fruit. The branches are tipped with "chorus flowers", which do not drop when the tree is broken, but can separately be broken (and dropped) by any tool, bare hands, or the impact of any projectile.  When a chorus flower is placed on [[end stone]], it grows into a chorus tree over time &mdash; unlike most trees, this is a step-wise process as the chorus flower generates branches one block at a time.

<gallery widths="100px">
File:Chorus plant.png|A chorus plant.
</gallery>

=== Variant trees ===
Some trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, while only dying trees can be grown out of normal saplings.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143349/http://i.imgur.com/hTg0N8J.gifv</ref><ref>{{Cite bug|MCPE|21304|Tree falled - Planted saplings sometimes grow as fallen trees|date=April 16, 2017}}</ref>

==== Fallen trees ====
{{Main|Fallen tree}}
[[File:Fallen Logs.jpg|thumb|The different fallen tree types.]]
Oak, spruce, birch, tall birch, and jungle trees can generate as fallen trees.

These trees consist of a single upright log, or stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump.

<gallery>

</gallery>

==== Dying trees ====
{{Exclusive|Bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Dying Trees.jpg|thumb|The different dying tree types.]]
These trees have the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with [[vines]]. They can generate as dark oak, jungle, spruce, or small oak trees, or can grow from saplings.
{{-}}

=== Joke ===
==== Potato tree ====
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
[[File:Potato Tree.png|thumb|upright=0.5|right|A large potato tree]]
The "potato tree" is found in the [[Potato Dimension]], added in [[24w14potato]] release for April Fool's Day in 2024. They vary in size, ranging from small trees that resemble [[jungle bush]]es to large trees that can reach over 50 blocks tall, appearing as if several [[acacia]] trees are stacked on top of each other. They grow potato fruits that hang from [[potato pedicule]]s.
{{-}}

== Foliage colors ==
{{main|Color#Biome colors}}
Depending on the [[biome]] the tree is located, the color of the leaves may differ. For example, if an oak is in a colder biome, such as a taiga or windswept hills biome, it has a blue-green hue. However, if it is in a dry biome, such as a desert or savanna, it has a mustard yellow hue. Spruce, birch, azalea, cherry, and pale oak leaves do not follow these rules; they always have the same color regardless of the biome. {{IN|bedrock}}, most leaves (with the exception of azalea, cherry, and pale oak) turn white during [[snowfall]].

<gallery>
File:FoliageWet.png|Foliage color in wetter biomes.
File:FoliageDry.png|Foliage color in drier biomes.
File:FoliageCold.png|Foliage color in colder biomes.
</gallery>

Leaves are checked individually for biome coloration rather than as part of a larger tree; as such, trees that were grown between biomes usually have multiple shades on each side.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Floating trees may appear when small above-ground lava lakes generate in a forested area.<ref>{{bug|MC-225839}}</ref> This happens since the tree is generated when the [[chunk]] loads first, before the lake appears underneath. This leaves the tree floating above the lake, causing the tree to catch fire, potentially spreading to other trees and starting a forest fire.
