'''18w30a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13.1]], released on July 25, 2018,<ref name="18w30a">{{snap|18w30a|July 25, 2018}}</ref> which adds a search bar in the world list and a few other things, and fixes many bugs.

== Additions ==
'''[[Block]]s'''
* Re-added punch-to-explode [[TNT]] using the <code>unstable</code> state (instead of the <code>explode</code> state in 1.12).

'''[[Gameplay]]'''
* Added a search bar in the world list.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Added {{keys|Control+F3+C}} to force a JVM crash, instead of a regular crash. However, with some keyboards it only triggers with right control.<ref>{{bug|MC-135509}}; per comments there, some keyboards do not allow pressing those keys at the same time (as they are in the same vertical column, presumably). http://keyboardchecker.com/ can be used to check.</ref>
