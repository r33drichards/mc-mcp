A '''chain''' is a metallic decoration [[block]] made from [[ingot]]s and [[nugget]]s.

== Variants ==
There are 9 variants of chain:
* {{BlockLink|id=all-copper-chains|Copper Chain}}
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Chain#Unoxidized|Copper Chain|Unoxidized Copper Chain}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Copper Chain|Waxed}})
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Chain#Exposed|Exposed Copper Chain}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Exposed Copper Chain|Waxed}})
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Chain#Weathered|Weathered Copper Chain}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Weathered Copper Chain|Waxed}})
** {{BlockLink|link=Copper Chain#Oxidized|Oxidized Copper Chain}} ({{BlockLink|Waxed Oxidized Copper Chain|Waxed}})
* {{BlockLink|Iron Chain}}

== Obtaining ==

=== Crafting ===
Both iron and regular unwaxed, unoxidized copper chains have the same crafting recipe format, using two nuggets and one ingot of the same type.

}}

== Usage ==
Chains can be used to suspend [[bell]]s, [[hanging sign]]s, and all variants of [[lantern]]s (normal, [[soul Lantern|soul]], [[copper Lantern|copper]]), as the chain texture connects to the chain of the lantern seamlessly as if it were part of it, and it connects the hanging sign chains together. Chains do not require a supporting block to be placed whether it is on the top, next to it or at the bottom. It can exist completely free-standing in mid air<ref>{{bug|MC-178791|||Invalid}}</ref> and it can be rotated. Chains connect horizontally or vertically, but not across different orientations (so a chain with N orientation does not connect to a chain with E orientation in the adjacent block). Horizontal chains one block above a surface may be walked over. Horizontal chains two blocks above a surface prevent players from traveling past them. Vertical chains block travel if targeted directly, but may be skirted.

Chains can be walked on.

Chains can be pushed by [[piston]]s without being broken.

==Trivia==
* A vertical chain, being a solid, but not a full block, allows for many sizes of mobs and players to pass alongside each piece horizontally.
* Chains are the only block type whose collision box does not align with the pixel grid; its width is 3 pixels, centered on the middle of the axis it is placed on, thus putting each of its collision faces 3/32 of a block away from its center.
