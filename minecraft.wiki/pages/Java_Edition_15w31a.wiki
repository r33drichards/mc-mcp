'''General'''
* Mobs have a 5% chance to spawn left-handed, through the new <code>LeftHanded</code> boolean tag.
** Mobs able to hold items hold them according to their dominant hand.

'''[[File: Shulker.png|32px]] [[Shulker]]s'''
* Short for "''Shell Lurker''".
* Hostile mobs with the appearance of a purple block.
** Only spawn on the ground or at the walls of End cities when they first generate.
* When attacking, they open their shell with a spinning animation, revealing the creature inhabiting.
** The creature looks like a little white cube with big eyes.
** Its attack consists of shooting projectiles.
*** The projectiles chase the player until the projectile is out of range.
**** They can only move along one of the three grid axes at a time and on integer steps.
***** This means they can move only via [[taxicab distance|taxicab geometry.]]
*** Projectiles can be knocked away by attacking them.
*** Getting hit by a projectile causes 2 hearts of damage and inflicts the Levitation status effect.
*** They take more damage while their shell is open.
**** Their shells are considered armor, and bounce arrows off.
** It has an idle animation, where it opens its shells a little to peak through. 
* Can be pushed by [[piston]]s, and can exist only on coordinates that are integers (except if they are on [[minecart]]s).
* Can teleport like an [[enderman]].
** Sometimes does this while being attacked or placed in unusual circumstances:
*** Removing its support block.
*** Pushing it into a non-air block (except piston heads).
*** Pushing a non-air block into its position (except piston heads).
* Is one of the few entities (apart from [[boat]]s and minecarts) that can be stood upon.
** It even displaces the player properly during its attacking and idle animations.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:EndCityEntrance.png|32px]] [[End cities]]'''
* Generate on the new outer End islands.
* Dungeon-type structure fashioned like a branching tower made of [[End stone]] and many of the new blocks.
** Resemble a tree house.
* Generate with [[shulker]]s in it.

'''[[File:End Ship.png|32px]] [[End ship]]s'''
* Can generate up in the air, right next to an End city.
** Always generate sailing away from what appears to be a pier.
** Composed of many of the same materials as the End city.
* Generate with [[shulker]]s in it.
* Have a [[beacon]] set to Speed, a [[brewing stand]] with [[potion]]s of Healing, and other loot.

'''[[File:Chorus plant.png|32px]] [[Chorus tree]]s'''
* Tree-like arrangements of the new [[chorus plant]] and [[chorus flower]] blocks.
* Generate on the outer End islands
* The whole structure is destroyed when the bottom-most block is destroyed, like [[cacti]].
* Can be farmed by planting the chorus fruit flowers that come from the top of the plants.
** Unlike cacti, chorus plants do not require the supporting block to be below it, but rather adjacent.
*** This allows the structure to grow around obstacles, like other plants.

'''[[File:End gateway JE1.png|32px]] [[End gateway]]s'''
* Small structures consisting of an [[End gateway block]] and two little bulbs of bedrock, at both the bottom and the top.
** Are an alternative way of traveling to the outer End islands, without having to build or fly all the way over there.
** Since the bulbs of bedrock only leave a one block slit on the horizontal plane, it is only accessible by throwing [[ender pearl]]s at it, or by riding [[pig]]s, [[boat]]s or [[minecart]]s.
*** The player is teleported to somewhere on the outer End islands.
*** The final location of the player depends on what angle they entered or at what angle the ender pearl was thrown at.
* One gateway is created for each dragon kill.
** Up to 20 gateways are possible to create this way.
** Gateways spawn in a radius around the End portal.
** Another gateway is created every time the player teleports to a new location.
*** The created gateway is linked to the original, so the player has a way back.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''

=== Gameplay ===
'''Dominant hand option'''
* An option for players to change their dominant hand on their player model.
** Under "Skin Customization".
* Changes the orientation of the offhand slot in the hotbar (left often suits right-hand players better and vice versa).

'''[[Dual wield]]ing'''
* Players can now use both hands at the same time to do different actions, with the left and right mouse buttons.
** For example, if a player has a pickaxe in their main hand and a torch in their other hand, right clicking places the torch.
*** This happens because a pickaxe lacks a right click use, and therefore the game tries to then treat the other item as if it's being right clicked.
*** The player cannot click both buttons at the same time.
** This is achieved through an extra inventory slot called the "offhand" slot.
*** Pressing {{key|F}} (by default) switches whatever item is selected in the hotbar with the item in the offhand (including no item).
*** The offhand slot is displayed next to the hotbar when it's not empty (left for right-hand players and vice versa).
**** It's also available in the [[inventory]] screen.
* Only the main hand can be used for attacking.
** Even bows can't be used in the offhand.
* [[Bow]]s can be used when something else is in the offhand. 
** Arrows in the offhand take priority over arrows in the rest of the inventory slots.
* The offhand model is invisible in first person view, while it's empty.
* Some attributes and enchantments apply to the offhand item, while others do not.

'''[[Status effect]]s'''
* {{EffectLink|Levitation}}
** Received when the player is hit by [[shulker]] projectiles.
** Makes player involuntarily float high into the air.
*** Can be used to get to higher places.
** Listed as a negative effect, due to the potential to kill from fall damage.
** Higher levels of Levitation result in faster floating, except for the last two:
*** Level 255 does nothing.
*** Level 254 results in slow fall (similar to lunar gravity).

* {{EffectLink|Glowing}}
** Received when players or mobs are hit by [[spectral arrow]]s.
** Makes player's outline glow, seen even through non-transparent blocks.
*** The outline includes the models of the currently held items.
** Listed as a negative effect, because it prevents players from hiding from other players.
** It becomes colored differently if the player is part of a team, to match its team color.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===

'''[[Door]]s'''
* Changed the shading on acacia, birch, dark oak and jungle doors.

'''[[Fire]] '''

** After:<br>[[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (unconnected) JE2.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NS) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (EW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NE) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (ES) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (SW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NEW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NES) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (ESW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NSW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Inactive Redstone Wire (NESW) JE4.png|32px]]<br>[[File:Active Redstone Wire (unconnected) JE2.png|32px]][[File:Active Redstone Wire (NS) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (EW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (NE) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (ES) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (SW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (NW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (NEW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (NES) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (ESW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (NSW) JE4.png|32px]] [[File:Active Redstone Wire (NESW) JE4.png|32px]]

'''[[Stairs]]'''
* Are now rotated 90° in the inventory.

'''[[Trapdoor]]s'''

'''Item models for chest-like blocks'''
* Unlike other blocks, [[chest]]s, [[trapped chest]]s and [[ender chest]]s have their item model rotated, to have the front face in view of the player.
** This made it easier to distinguish between trapped and regular chests while being held, since only their front face is different.

'''[[Map]]s'''
* Now display as a mini map when held in the off hand, or if the offhand slot is occupied.
** The (old) large version is visible only when held in the dominant hand with both hands-free.

'''[[Potion]]s'''

* Numeric IDs are no longer used. Instead, a "Potion" tag is used.

* Splash potions now have a separate data value and ID name and can be created from all potions, including water bottles.
* Added Mundane, Thick and Awkward potions to the Creative inventory.

'''[[Chicken]]s'''
* Can be led and bred with [[melon seeds]], [[pumpkin seeds]], and [[beetroot seeds]], in addition to regular [[wheat seeds|seeds]].

'''[[Ender dragon]]s'''
* Similar to the one on [[Legacy Console Edition]].
* The dragon can be re-spawned indefinitely by creating a creeper face configuration out of [[clay]] in [[the End]].
** Subsequent dragons spawn new gateways, but don't drop [[XP]] or create new [[dragon egg]]s.
* The dragon AI and attacks has been changed:
** Breathes fire/purple particles on players and mobs, while on top of the portal.
** Drops fireballs on top of the player.
** Defends the obsidian pillars more, the further the fight progresses.
* The dragon flies and stops over the portal sometimes, only then can the last blow be dealt.

** End islands and mini End islands have chorus trees spread throughout them.

'''[[The Nether]]'''

'''[[Village]]s'''

'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Rearranged the Survival inventory and the Creative "Survival tab" to accommodate for the new offhand slot.
* Unified the orientation of many items in the inventory.

'''[[Status effect]]s'''
* Status effects icons are now displayed on the HUD on the right hand corner, instead of just in the inventory (similar to [[Pocket Edition]]).

'''Damage tooltips'''
* Items can damage differently based on where they are placed to (main hand, offhand, armor slots).

'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Death messages now are displayed on the player's death screen as well as in the chat.

'''[[Models]]'''

** This works on compasses, clocks, and anything that can have a durability bar.
