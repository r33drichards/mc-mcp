'''Introducing New Default Skins!''' is an animated short made to introduce the newly expanded cast of ''[[Minecraft]]''.

== Summary ==
[[Alex]] is building with [[wool]] on top of an oversized [[Trader Llama|trader llama]] statue, before looking down at [[Steve]] and waving. Steve starts placing [[scaffolding]] to reach her and pass a [[redstone torch]], but trips and falls off. Luckily, [[Ari]] arrives wearing [[elytra]] and grabs it, flying past a flock of [[Parrot|parrots]] before dropping the torch to [[Zuri]], who is gathering resources with [[Sunny]]. Zuri runs off to return the torch, but is caught off guard by an emerging [[creeper]], the two running over a [[wheat]] farm being tended to by [[Kai]] and [[Makena]]. Still being chased by the creeper, Zuri trips over a [[cat]], dropping the torch once again.

The torch is caught by none other than [[Noor]], who is mining for [[Coal Ore|coal]] in a cave with Ari. Noor then falls into a [[minecart]], and is propelled into the air by an extensive railway while another cat chases potentially the same creeper through a [[savanna]]. The torch next lands in the hands of [[Sunny]] in a [[boat]], who is attempting to [[Fishing|fish]] in a border between biomes. Sunny is momentarily confused by the torch, before getting hit and sunk by Noor's body. From there the torch sinks underwater and is found by [[Efe]], who is fighting a horde of [[drowned]]. Efe is also momentarily confused, but quickly manages to [[Swimming|swim]] away and scurries onto the surface face first, before joining the chase with the cat and creeper.

Efe begins [[riding]] a [[pig]], before bumping into Makena gliding. Efe hands the torch to Makena, who then finally returns it to Alex. From there, all nine of the heroes appear at the base of the llama statue and light up [[Redstone lamp|redstone lamps]] built into it, using their own torches. With that, Alex places the inciting torch onto the statue, activating a unique [[dispenser]] mechanism designed to resemble spitting, and everyone celebrates, but not before the creeper returns and nearly blows everyone up. The video ends on a shot of the full group standing in a light blue void, with the caption "tell your story, with default skins."
