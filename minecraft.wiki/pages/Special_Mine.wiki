|Put on a show{{note|After locating the stage, enter backstage through the door on the right. Use a goat horn from the chest nearest the door to signal the show beginning. Then, take a [[Music Disc And Action!|'disc' (stylized as a movie clapper)]] from a second chest near a jukebox and play it. Activate the 'light show' by stepping on and off the pressure plate beside a piston. When the prompt at the bottom of the screen indicates, take the mob heads from the first chest and wear one onto the stage. Switch between heads until the Warden reacts. Finally, return backstage, go up the stairs, and use the redstone in the chest to connect the lever to all three dispensers. Right click the lever repeatedly to announce the end of the show with fireworks.}} for the crowd with the [[Warden]] (bugged?){{note|The exit portal fails to spawn after completing the show. Leaving the area and returning after it unloads will spawn an exit on the stage, which is similar behavior to other special mines that require the player to kill certain enemies. This may suggest that completing the show is not the correct solution to the world, despite the provided instructions.}}, and/or kill the Warden.
