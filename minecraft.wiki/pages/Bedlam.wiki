The '''Bedlam''', previously known as '''The Sham''', is a haunted [[bed]] that first appeared in the [[Campfire Tales]] [[skin pack]]. It was also the titular character of ''The Sham'', the fourth episode of the first season of the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]''.

==Biography==
The origin of the Bedlam is unknown, but according to a Campfire Tale, it preferred bleary-headed victims and reveled in the fright of those it frightened. Allegedly, it claimed the souls of its victims when they fell asleep on it.<ref name=poem>{{tweet|Minecraft|782883142046740484|Feeling sleepy? How about another Campfire Tale before you turn in?|October 3, 2016}}</ref>

[[CommuniKate]] may have been aware of this legend and had incorporated the Bedlam in a challenge on [[Eerie Island]] in her reality show, threatening [[Rudi]] and [[Durango]]. However, it ultimately didn't kill or even harm anyone, instead only costing them points in the game.

==Trivia==
* There was a feature in ''Minecraft'' [[Beta 1.3]] through [[Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5]] where a [[zombie]] or a [[skeleton]] had the chance of spawning when a player slept. This is similar to the Bedlam's behavior, except that the bed itself is the monster.
* The Bedlam was based on a [[Mash-up pack#Minifigures based on Mash-Up Packs or Skin Packs|minifigure]] made by Mattel which in turn was based on a skin with the same name in the [[Campfire Tales]] [[skin pack]].
* The Bedlam was originally named "The Sham" before it was renamed at an unknown date.
* The word "Bedlam" is used to convey a setting or scene of mayhem or confusion.
** The word "sham" is used to mean something that is false or pretending to be something it's not. A "pillow sham" is a decorative pillowcase for storing pillows when they aren't being used.
