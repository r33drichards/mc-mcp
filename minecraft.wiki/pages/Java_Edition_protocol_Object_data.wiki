This article documents the '''Data''' field in the [[Java Edition protocol/Packets#Spawn Entity|Spawn Entity]] packet. The field is of type {{Type|VarInt}}, and the meaning of its contents depend on the [[Java Edition protocol/Entity_metadata|type of entity]] being spawned, as defined in the Type field of the same packet, and is documented below.

The Notchian client clamps invalid values into the valid range through the modulus operator. If the resulting value is negative, the absolute value is used.

Velocity in the packet is always ignored.

The Notchian client clamps invalid values into the valid range through the modulus operator. If the resulting value is negative, the absolute value is used.

{{Warning|Although the values of 0 and 1 are invalid, the Notchian client uses the same clamping algorithm as [[#Item_Frame|Item Frame]], which can result in any value from 0 to 5. If the resulting value is invalid, the entity will fail to spawn.}}

Velocity in the packet is always ignored.

 | Block state ID

 | Owner
 | {{Type|VarInt}}
 | The entity ID of the owner
 |}

{{Warning|If the entity with the Owner ID doesn't exist in the client, the entity will fail to spawn.}}

Velocity in the packet is ignored, and instead should be inferred from the shooter's position.

 | Pose
 | {{Type|VarInt}}
 | If a value of 1 is specified, the Warden will spawn in the [[Java Edition protocol/Entity_metadata#Entity_Metadata_Format|emerging pose]].
Any other value is silently ignored.
