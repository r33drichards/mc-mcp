A '''minecart with TNT''' is a [[minecart]] with [[TNT]] inside. Unlike normal TNT, it can detonate instantly, and its blast radius and damage is increased by its speed at detonation.

== Obtaining ==
Minecarts with TNT can be retrieved by attacking them, and doing so drops them as an [[item]]. [[Critical hits]] are not applied to them, although the particles suggest otherwise.

=== Crafting ===

== Usage ==
[[File:TNT minecart and powered activator rail.png|thumb|right|When the minecart with TNT passes over the powered activator rail, it explodes after four seconds.]]
[[File:Simple TNT minecart detonator setup.png|thumb|right|{{IN|je}}, placing two minecarts with TNT on the rail and powering it (here, by flicking the lever) creates an instant explosion.]]
[[File:TNT minecart roof trap.png|thumb|right|Destroying the block of gold causes the minecart with TNT to fall down and instantly explode.]]

A minecart with TNT detonates after a delay on these conditions:
* It moves over a powered [[activator rail]].
* It is destroyed while in motion (except by a player in Creative mode).
* It is destroyed by fire, lava, or an explosion.
* It is hit by a [[fire charge]] projectile.
* Using a [[flint and steel]], [[fire charge]], or any [[item]] enchanted with [[Fire Aspect]].{{Only|BE}}

The delay is {{convert|4|seconds|ticks}} for an activator rail, like the TNT block. For other causes there is a random delay between 0 and 1.95 seconds.

It detonates instantly on these conditions:

* It hits the ground with a downward velocity of it falling more than three blocks, unless landing on any form of rail.
* It turns on a curved track too fast, with a solid block or entity located beside the track (in the previous movement direction). {{only|je}}
* It is hit by a flaming projectile.
* It is pressed into a block or entity and has velocity.{{only|je}}

Upon detonation it acts as normal TNT, [[exploding]] and damaging nearby blocks, players, and entities. Upon detonation after activating on activator rail, it does not destroy its rails and the blocks the rail is on, however other nearby minecarts can.{{only|java}} More than one minecart can be placed on the same rail block, allowing many of them to fit into a single block. {{IN|je}} they explode when touched, dealing large amounts of damage.

The explosion has a base [[Explosion#Explosion strength|power]] of 4, the same as regular TNT, but the game also adds a random bonus value up to 1.5 times velocity, but no higher than 7.5. This means that with a speed of 5 or higher the power is a random value between 4 and 11.5. When triggered by an activator rail or by damage, the bonus value is calculated using the horizontal velocity of the minecart. When hit by a flaming arrow the velocity of the arrow is used instead. When triggered by fall damage, the fall distance divided by 10 is used.

Minecarts with TNT bounce off of other minecarts and cannot be linked to [[minecarts with furnace]]s.

=== Entity data ===
Minecarts with TNT have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.

{{el|java}}:
{{main|Entity format}}
<section begin="entity data"/><div class="treeview" style="margin-top: 0;">
* {{nbt|compound}} Entity data
** {{nbt inherit/entity}}
** {{nbt inherit/vehicle}}
** {{nbt|int|fuse}}: Time until explosion or -1 if not activated.
** {{nbt|float|explosion_power}}: A value from 0 to 128. Additional [[Explosion#Block_destruction|explosion power]], which is added to the speed-based explosion power. Defaults to 4.0. If set to the default value, this field is not saved to the entity's NBT.
** {{nbt|float|explosion_speed_factor}}: Controls the amount of added damage depending on the speed of the Minecart. Defaults to 1.0. If set to the default value, this field is not saved to the entity's NBT.
