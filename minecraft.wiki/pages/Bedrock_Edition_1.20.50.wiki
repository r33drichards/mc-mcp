*** For example, a ravager won't be able to attack through a few block thick walls.
** In vertical directions, mobs' attack reach are now the exact vertical range of their bounding box. When there's no overlap between their bounding box and their target's bounding box in vertical direction, they can not attack, in specific:
*** Riding a medium-sized mob (e.g. horse) can get rid of attacks from short mobs (e.g. baby zombie).
*** Riding a tall mob (e.g. camel) can get rid of attacks from standard size mobs (e.g. zombie).

==== Blocks ====
'''[[Chiseled Copper]]'''
* Have 8 variants in {{Animate|Chiseled Copper.png; Exposed Chiseled Copper.png; Weathered Chiseled Copper.png; Oxidized Chiseled Copper.png|32px}} 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Can be crafted both in [[crafting table]] and [[stonecutter]]:
** When in crafting table, consume 2 [[cut copper slab]]s from the same type, resulting in 1 chiseled copper with the same type.
** When in stonecutter, consume 1 [[block of copper]], resulting in 4 chiseled copper from the same type.

'''[[Chiseled Tuff]]'''
* Can be crafted from [[Tuff Slab|tuff slab]]s or can be obtained by cutting tuff using a [[stonecutter]].

'''[[Chiseled Tuff Bricks]]'''
* Can be crafted from [[Tuff Slab|tuff brick slab]]s or can be obtained by cutting tuff, tuff bricks, and polished tuff using a [[stonecutter]].

'''[[Copper Bulb]]'''
* A light-emitting block that can toggle its light emission through redstone pulses.
* Have 8 variants in {{Animate|Copper Bulb.png; Exposed Copper Bulb.png; Weathered Copper Bulb.png; Oxidized Copper Bulb.png|32px}} 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Can be crafted in crafting table with a cross pattern, by 3 blocks of copper from the same type, 1 [[blaze rod]] in the center slot, and 1 [[redstone dust]] in the bottom slot, resulting in 1 copper bulb with the same type.
* They emit less light the more {{Animate|Lit Copper Bulb.png; Lit Exposed Copper Bulb.png; Lit Weathered Copper Bulb.png; Lit Oxidized Copper Bulb.png|32px}} oxidized they are. From less oxidized to most oxidized, they emit block light levels of 15, 12, 8, and 4, respectively.
* While powered by a redstone signal, a redstone crystal in the center of them will glow.
* They have following properties:
** Only toggle their light on or off when receiveing a {{Animate|Lit Powered Copper Bulb.png; Lit Powered Exposed Copper Bulb.png; Lit Powered Weathered Copper Bulb.png; Lit Powered Oxidized Copper Bulb.png; Powered Copper Bulb.png; Powered Exposed Copper Bulb.png; Powered Weathered Copper Bulb.png; Powered Oxidized Copper Bulb.png|32px}} redstone pulse. Their state will not be changed if the source of the redstone pulse is removed.
** When the light is on, redstone comparators will read a redstone signal strength of 15.
** Don't conduct redstone power.

'''[[Copper Door]] and [[Copper Trapdoor]]'''
* Have 8 variants in {{Animate|Copper Door.png; Exposed Copper Door.png; Weathered Copper Door.png; Oxidized Copper Door.png|32px}} {{Animate|Copper Trapdoor.png; Exposed Copper Trapdoor.png; Weathered Copper Trapdoor.png; Oxidized Copper Trapdoor.png|32px}} 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Works like wooden doors in that they can be opened and closed by the player as well as redstone.
* Can be crafted as other doors, with blocks of copper from the same type.

'''[[Copper Grate]]'''
* A new type of decorative block unique to the copper family.
* Have 8 variants in {{Animate|Copper Grate.png; Exposed Copper Grate.png; Weathered Copper Grate.png; Oxidized Copper Grate.png|32px}} 4 oxidation levels, waxed or not waxed.
* Can be crafted both in crafting table and stonecutter:
** When in crafting table, consume 4 blocks of copper from the same type in rhombic pattern, resulting in 1 copper grate with the same type.
** When in stonecutter, consume 1 block of copper, resulting in 4 copper grate from the same type.
* They have the following properties:
** Transparent and allows light to pass through.
** Cannot conduct redstone.
** Hostile mobs cannot naturally spawn on them.

'''[[Crafter]]'''
* A variant of [[crafting table]], can be crafted with five [[iron ingot]]s, a crafting table, two [[redstone dust]]s, and a [[dropper]].
* Have a user interface similar to crafting table.
** Have 3×3 interactable crafting grid.
** Their crafting grid slots are toggleable, meaning that the player can change the behavior of a slot by clicking or pressing on a slot with an empty hand.
*** A toggled slot cannot hold any items and therefore cannot have items placed into it by other blocks such as [[hopper]]s and droppers.
*** A toggled slot can be toggled off by player, whether clicked directly or holding item(s), pressing slot keys associated with an empty or a not empty hotbar slot.
** Unlike the crafting table, the slots display a preview of the crafted item which will be crafted and ejected on the next redstone pulse but cannot be manually taken out by the player.
** The user interface is shared between all players interacting with them, meaning that multiple players can interact with them at the same time, similar to [[chest]]s and hoppers.
* Crafters can be oriented in any direction when placed.
* A [[pickaxe]] can increase the speed of mining them.
* The crafter ejects one crafted item at a time when powered by a new redstone pulse, a redstone signal that is not a continuous signal.
** Upon receiving this new signal, crafters eject the recipe result from the front face.
** All the result items will be ejected together when the output result has multiple type of items.
* They can interact with hoppers and droppers, to input/output automatically.
** Hoppers can be used to both insert and pull items out of them.
** Droppers can be used to insert items into them.
** Moving items in from another block with a hopper or a dropper prioritizes filling items into slots, by following these rules:
*** If there is a toggled slot, skipped.
*** If there is not a toggled slot, crafters prioritize the first empty slot from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
*** If there is not a toggled slot, and there are no empty slots, crafters prioritize the smallest stack of the same item. If there are multiple possible stacks, pick the first from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
** If failed to select a slot, hoppers and droppers will not take any action.
* When read by a [[redstone comparator]], the redstone signal strength is 0 to 9, where each non-empty or toggled slot adds 1 strength.

'''[[Polished Tuff]]'''
* Can be crafted from [[tuff]] or can be obtained by cutting tuff using a [[stonecutter]].
* Can be used to craft respective [[File:Polished Tuff Stairs.png|32px]] [[stairs]], [[File:Polished Tuff Slab.png|32px]] [[slab]]s, [[File:Polished Tuff Wall.png|32px]] [[wall]]s, and [[File:Tuff Bricks.png|32px]] [[Tuff Bricks|bricks]].

'''[[Tuff Bricks]]'''
* Can be crafted from [[polished tuff]] or can be obtained by cutting tuff using a [[stonecutter]].
* Can be used to craft respective [[File:Tuff Brick Stairs.png|32px]] [[stairs]], [[File:Tuff Brick Slab.png|32px]] [[slab]]s (that can be used to craft [[File:Chiseled Tuff Bricks.png|32px]] [[chiseled tuff bricks]]), and [[File:Tuff Brick Wall.png|32px]] [[wall]]s.

'''[[Tuff Stairs]], [[Tuff Slab]], and [[Tuff Wall]]'''
* Can be crafted from [[tuff]] or can be obtained by cutting tuff using a [[stonecutter]].
* Tuff slabs can be used to craft [[File:Chiseled Tuff.png|32px]] [[chiseled tuff]].

=== Changes ===

* Now can be used to craft respective {{Animate|Copper Door.png; Exposed Copper Door.png; Weathered Copper Door.png; Oxidized Copper Door.png|32px}} [[Copper Door|doors]] and {{Animate|Copper Trapdoor.png; Exposed Copper Trapdoor.png; Weathered Copper Trapdoor.png; Oxidized Copper Trapdoor.png|32px}} [[Copper Trapdoor|trapdoors]], as well as the {{Animate|Copper Bulb.png; Exposed Copper Bulb.png; Weathered Copper Bulb.png; Oxidized Copper Bulb.png|32px}} [[copper bulb]] and {{Animate|Copper Grate.png; Exposed Copper Grate.png; Weathered Copper Grate.png; Oxidized Copper Grate.png|32px}} [[copper grate]], or any variant of the block of copper cutting it in a [[stonecutter]].

'''[[Tuff]]'''
* Now can be used to craft a [[File:Polished Tuff.png|32px]] [[Polished Tuff|polished]] variant and respective [[File:Tuff Stairs.png|32px]] [[stairs]], [[File:Tuff Slab.png|32px]] [[slab]]s, and [[File:Tuff Wall.png|32px]] [[wall]]s, or any form and variant of tuff cutting it in a [[stonecutter]].
