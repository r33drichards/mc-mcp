'''1.5.1'''<ref>https://mcupdate.tumblr.com/post/45905956059/minecraft-151</ref> is a minor update to {{JE}} released on March 21, 2013,<ref>{{tweet|jeb|314689089347665920}}</ref> which mainly fixed issues with low frame rates on certain devices. As the protocol is the same as [[Java Edition 1.5|1.5]], players on 1.5.1 can connect to servers that are running 1.5. While it was not the last update to 1.5, it was the last one before the snapshots of [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6.1]] started.

A [[Java Edition 1.5.1 (pre-release)|pre-release version of 1.5.1]] was released on March 19, 2013. The 1.5.1 pre-release was reuploaded on March 20, 2013, to fix a null pointer crash<ref name="reupload">{{cite|url=https://www.mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-1-5-1-pre-release/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2013/03/minecraft-1-5-1-pre-release/|title=Minecraft 1.5.1 Pre-release|date=March 19, 2013|website=Mojang.com|author=Jens Bergensten}}</ref> and this reupload became the full release of 1.5.1.
