=== Gameplay ===

'''[[Biomes]]'''
* Some {{BiomeSprite|snowy plains}} [[ice plains]] and {{BiomeSprite|snowy mountains}} [[ice mountains]] have been replaced by {{BiomeLink|taiga}} and {{BiomeLink|taiga hills}}.

'''[[Experience]]'''
* Gaining experience from mining ore is now different for each type of ore (mining [[coal ore]] will give the player the least amount while [[diamond ore]] & [[emerald ore]] will give the most amount of XP).

== Fixes ==
'''13 bugs fixed'''
* Newly added wooden [[stairs]] will now burn.
* Fixed {{cmd|kill}} not working.
* Fixed powering specific glitched pistons crashing the game.
* Fixed a visual bug causing pistons to be partially invisible or in the wrong location momentarily.
* Fixed being able to place [[Nether portal|portals]] in [[the Nether]] in locations where they would end up in illegal locations in the overworld.
* Fixed the game crashing when publishing SP worlds with certain language settings.
* Fixed players on [[minecart]]s, [[boat]]s or [[pig]]s and spider jockeys not being displayed in the correct location.
* Fixed a bug with [[dispenser]]s.
* Fixed {{cmd|say}} not accepting some strings from the console, often triggering the help dialogue.
* Fixed being able to transmute blocks to certain [[data values]] using an orientation-dependent [[String#Tripwire|tripwire]] bug.
* Fixed drinking [[potions]] in creative not consuming the potions, but still giving empty [[Glass Bottle|bottles]].
* Fixed signs sometimes not saving the text when placing them.
* Fixed torches at the top of 1&times;1 vertical shafts not lighting up their own block.</onlyinclude>

== Trivia ==
* Even though this version's changelog mentions changes related to pistons, those changes were actually added to the game in the previous snapshot.
