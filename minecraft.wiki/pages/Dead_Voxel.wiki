== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Dead voxel.ogg]]

"Dead Voxel" begins with dark ambient sounds and distant, high-pitched synthesizers, similar to ones heard in "Ballad of the Cats", and later turns into a serene, but dramatic piano song with a fittingly warm ambient backing and an accompaniment of an oriental-sounding synth imitating a plucked instrument.

The track is a less dissonant, more somber variant of "Concrete Halls", with softer percussion. The sound of lava flowing and bubbling can be heard in the background. At the end, part of "Beginning" can be heard.
