{{DISPLAYTITLE:al_version}}
'''al_version''' (AppletLoader version) is a number used in versions prior to [[Java Edition Alpha]] to uniquely identify a set of jar files to be cached. It was used to tell the LWJGL AppletLoader when to clear its cache so LWJGL and client jars could be updated automatically.

== Usage ==
al_version is a positive floating-point number given as a parameter to the LWJGL AppletLoader in the HTML code of <code>[[minecraft.net]]/play.jsp</code>.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090525130611/http://minecraft.net/play.jsp Minecraft.net/play.jsp] (source) – Wayback Machine, May 25, 2009. "''&lt;param name="al_version" value="5.17"&gt;''".</ref>
It is used to specify a unique version for each jar file to cache them for re-use.
If the stored al_version matches the latest jar files, those jar files are re-used; otherwise the previously saved jars are removed from the cache and new ones are downloaded.
