'''1.11.1''' is a minor update for {{JE}} released on December 20, 2016.<ref name="article">{{Mcnet|minecraft-1112-released|Minecraft 1.11.1 Released|December 20, 2016}}</ref> It is not compatible with [[Java Edition 1.11|1.11]] servers. This update added [[iron nugget]]s, which can be smelted from iron [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s; the [[Sweeping Edge]] enchantment; and fireworks can now boost flying players.

== Additions ==
{{Additions table

|Enchanted Book[&7Sweeping Edge I]
|Enchanted Book[&7Sweeping Edge II]
|Enchanted Book[&7Sweeping Edge III]
}}

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Iron Nugget.png|32px]] [[Iron nugget]]s'''
* Can be crafted from [[iron ingot]]s, but are also received from smelting iron tools and armor.
* Can be crafted into iron ingots.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* Added [[Sweeping Edge]].
** Can be applied to a [[sword]] to increase the [[damage]] of the [[sweep attack]].
*** The damage dealt is <code>1 + Base_Damage × (Sweeping_Edge_Level / (Sweeping_Edge_Level + 1))</code>, rounded to the nearest integer.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Furnace]]s'''
* Iron and golden [[tool]]s and [[armor]] can be [[smelt]]ed into [[nugget]]s. Iron and golden [[horse armor]] can also be smelted.
** Yield one iron or golden nugget per [[item]] respectively.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Firework]]s'''
* While flying using [[elytra]], {{control|using}} a firework gives the player a boost for a certain amount of time. This emits [[particle]]s when in use.
** Fireworks stay at the [[player]]'s location until they disappear or [[explode]].
** Longer flight duration on the rocket makes the boost last longer. Players can increase the flight duration of a firework by crafting it with more [[gunpowder]].
** Fireworks with an explosion deal damage at the end of their flight.
** The right-click on a [[block]] action for the fireworks is prioritized over the right click ability in midair. This simply means that when you look at a block while flying and right click, the rocket will shoot regularly, instead of being used as a boost.
* Firework explosions now [[Damage|hurt]] surrounding [[mob]]s and players.
** The damage radius of the explosion is about 2-3 blocks and is the same for any shape (large ball, creeper, burst, etc.). Damage decreases with the distance to the explosion.
** The damage amount at close range is about {{hp|5}} without [[armor]] on, and with full [[diamond armor]], it equates to about {{hp|1}}.
** [[Death message]] is "[player] went off with a bang".

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Damage#Attack cooldown|Attack indicator]]'''
* When in crosshair mode, the [[weapon]] is fully cooled, and a [[mob]] or [[entity]] is in range of attack, the attack indicator will be visible and will include a small plus sign (+) underneath the crosshair.

'''[[Enchantments]]'''
* [[Mending]] is no longer compatible with [[Infinity]] on [[bow]]s when trying to apply them with an [[anvil]] or when using the {{cmd|enchant}} command.
** Old bows with both [[enchantment]]s applied still keep their enchantments and remain working as they used to.
* Anvils no longer apply [[enchanted book]]s to [[item]]s, if the result has no effect.
** This can occur if all enchantments on the book are incompatible with existing enchantments on the item.
** This can also occur if the enchanted book has no enchantments.

=== General ===
'''[[Totem of undying]]'''
* ID name changed from <code>totem</code> to <code>totem_of_undying</code>.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Removed the 'Junk Fished' and 'Treasure Fished' statistics

'''[[Piston]]s'''
* Added a new byte tag <code>source</code> for the <code>piston_extension</code> block entity, which is true if the block represents the piston head itself, and false if it represents a block being pushed.

'''[[Arrow]]s'''
* Added a new integer tag <code>Color</code> to be used by the <code>arrow</code> entity, for displaying the custom potion color of a fired arrow item that had a <code>CustomPotionColor</code> tag.
