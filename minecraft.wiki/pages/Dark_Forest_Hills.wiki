The '''dark forest hills''' or '''roofed forest mutated''' biome was a rare variant of the [[Dark Forest|dark forest]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
The mountains and cliffs of the dark forest hills broke the leaf canopy, increasing visibility and decreasing the chance of daytime hostile mob spawning, though the hills were steeper compared to other hill biomes. Hills generated near [[river]]s led to cliffs. Small [[plains]] biome clearings did not generate within the dark forest hills variant. The foliage was the same as in regular dark forests, with a high density of [[Dark oak tree|dark oak trees]], [[oak trees]], [[birch trees]], and [[Huge mushroom|huge mushrooms]]. The ground was covered with different [[Flower|flowers]]. [[Woodland Mansion|Woodland mansions]] also generated here, often with a very high base due to the high elevation.

Although this biome is called 'dark forest hills', it did not actually generate as a 'hills' variant, but as a 'modified' variant of the dark forest, making it slightly rarer.

== Mobs ==
Dark forest hills used the same mob spawning chances as dark forests.

The following mobs naturally spawn here:
