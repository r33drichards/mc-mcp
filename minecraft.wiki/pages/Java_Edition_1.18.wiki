'''1.18''', the second and final release of '''[[Caves & Cliffs]],''' is a major update to {{JE}} released on November 30, 2021.<ref name=":0">{{Mcnet|caves---cliffs--part-ii-out-today-java|Caves & Cliffs: Part II out today on Java|November 30, 2021}}</ref> It completely overhauls the Overworld generation, with larger caves, taller mountains, new mountain biomes, new cave biomes, and [[Aquifer|flooded caves]]. It was first announced alongside the release of [[Java Edition 1.17|1.17]] snapshot [[21w15a]] when [[Mojang Studios]] stated that the Caves & Cliffs update would be split in two.<ref>{{Mcnet|a-caves---cliffs-announcement|A Caves & Cliffs announcement|April 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{snap|21w15a|April 14, 2021}}</ref> Some features for 1.18 were initially implemented during 1.17's development cycle, before getting postponed and relegated to [[Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack|official data pack]]s used with a corresponding 1.17 snapshot.<ref>[https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402614709389-Caves-Cliffs-Prototype-Data-Pack-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition Caves & Cliffs Prototype Data Pack for Minecraft Java Edition]</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Music Disc Otherside JE1 BE1.png|32x32px]] [[Otherside]] music disc'''
* Added a new [[music disc]] from [[Lena Raine]] titled "otherside".
** Can be found on rare occasions in [[stronghold]] corridor chests, or more rarely in [[Monster room]] chests.
** Has a blue and green color to the ring area of the disc.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Caves]]'''
* Completely overhauled.
* Now stretch down to Y=-64.
* The caves now generate in 2 layers of different stone bases depending on the depth.
** The layer above Y=8 is made up of regular [[stone]].
** Stone transitions to [[deepslate]] from Y=8 to Y=0.
** Deepslate completely replaces stone from Y=0 to [[bedrock]].
*** Certain types of ores and structures still generate in the deepslate layer, as well as [[tuff]] and [[gravel]].
*** [[Dirt]], [[diorite]], [[granite]] and [[andesite]] do not generate in this layer.
* Biomes such as the [[dripstone caves]] and [[lush caves]] now generate in the underground.
* Contain [[aquifers]], bodies of [[water]] with different heights, independent of sea level (Y=63).
** Aquifers below Y=0 sometimes generate with lava instead of water.
* Improved old caves to blend in with the new generations of caves better
* New noise caves, coming in 3 forms, "cheese", "spaghetti", and "noodle".
** Cheese caves have large stone towers stretching from the bottom of the cave to the top, and are often large enough to allow safe elytra flight.
** Spaghetti caves are long, thin caves that have small aquifers and are more similar to original caves.
** Noodle caves are thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variants of spaghetti caves.

'''[[Mountains]]'''
* Come in 6 sub-biomes:
** {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
*** A grassy elevated biome that looks like a flowery and colder [[plain]]s, with an aqua [[grass]] color and dark blue water color.
*** Generates in plateaus and the lowest layers of some mountains, usually near plains and other temperate biomes.
*** Contains [[grass]], [[tall grass]], [[dandelion]]s, [[azure bluet]]s, [[cornflower]]s, [[poppies]], [[oxeye daisies]] and [[allium]]s.
*** Birch and oak trees can rarely appear in this biome, and always have [[bee nest]]s.
*** Only [[rabbit]]s, [[donkey]]s, and [[sheep]] spawn in this biome.
*** Plains [[village]]s and [[pillager outpost]]s can generate in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Grove}}
*** Generates in the slopes of a snowy mountain when next to forested biomes.
*** Reminiscent of a [[snowy taiga]] with a surface of [[snow block]]s and [[powder snow]], instead of [[grass block]]s.
*** [[Rabbit]]s, [[wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[cow]]s spawn in this biome.
*** Pillager outposts can generate in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Snowy slopes}}
*** Generates in the slopes of a mountain when next to plains and snowy tundra.
*** Covered in snow, snow block and powder snow.
*** Only [[rabbit]]s and [[goat]]s spawn in this biome.
*** [[Igloo]]s and pillager outposts can generate in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Jagged peaks}}
*** One of three biomes that generate in the mountain peaks.
*** Covered in snow, snow blocks and [[stone]].
*** Tends to generate in sharp and jagged peaks in areas with snowy, cold, and temperate biomes.
*** Only [[goats]] spawn in this biome.
*** Pillager outposts can generate in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Frozen peaks}}
*** One of three biomes that generate in the mountain peaks.
*** Covered in snow, snow blocks, ice, and [[packed ice]].
*** Tends to generate in smoother and less jagged peaks in areas with snowy, cold, and temperate biomes.
*** Only [[goat]]s spawn in this biome.
*** Pillager outposts can generate in this biome.
** {{BiomeLink|Stony peaks}}
*** One of three biomes that generate in the mountain peaks.
*** Covered in [[stone]], [[gravel]], and strips of [[calcite]].
*** Tends to generate in any peak surrounded by warm biomes such as [[jungle]]s and [[savanna]]s, to avoid temperature clashes.
*** No animals spawn in this biome.
*** Pillager outposts can generate in this biome.

'''[[Ore vein]]s'''
* Long and rare [[ore]] formations.
* [[Copper ore]] veins mixed with [[granite]] and [[blocks of raw copper]] generate above Y=0.
* [[Iron ore]] veins mixed with [[tuff]] and [[blocks of raw iron]] generate below Y=0.

'''Upgrading of old worlds'''
* The biomes and terrain from old and new chunks now seamlessly blend, preventing the hard cut borders from before. Any player-made structures in these chunks may either be intact, buried, or deteriorated.
* Several checks are made on the previous [[bedrock]] layer to determine whether or not a chunk should generate new terrain below.
** The game first checks if there is any bedrock at Y=0.
*** If bedrock is detected, the game then checks if each column in a chunk has air at Y=0. New terrain generates only under columns with non-air blocks.
*** If there is no bedrock whatsoever at Y=0, the whole chunk does not get new terrain below.
* The old bedrock layer between Y=0 and Y=4 in old chunks gets replaced with [[deepslate]].
** A new bedrock layer is placed between Y=-64 and Y=-60.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|jfr}}'''
* When enabled, begins profiling with Java FlightRecorder, as well as the following custom events:
** '''minecraft.ServerTickTime''': Sampling event exposing average server tick times in intervals of a second
** '''minecraft.ChunkGeneration''': Time taken to generate individual chunk stages
** '''minecraft.PacketRead''' / '''minecraft.PacketSent''': Network traffic
** '''minecraft.WorldLoadFinishedEvent''': Initial world loading duration
* The profiling can be stopped in-game by using {{cmd|jfr stop}}.
* If it is started from an external source, the JFR events for network packets are aggregated instead of one event per packet.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
{{Load advancements|Caves & Cliffs;Feels like home;Sound of Music;Star Trader}}
* Added two new advancement triggers.
** {{cd|fall_from_height}}
*** Triggered when a player lands after falling.
** {{cd|ride_entity_in_lava}}
*** Triggered for every tick when player rides in lava.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Added three new lines: Multinoise, biome builder, and terrain.
** Appears if the dimension where the player is uses the multi-noise biome source type.
** Multinoise lists the parameters used at the player's position in order to place a biome. C is continentalness, E is erosion, T is temperature, H is humidity, and W is weirdness. 
*** Continentalness goes up as you go more inland. In areas with low continentalness values, oceans may generate.
*** Erosion determines how flat or mountainous terrain is. Higher values result in flatter areas, lower values result in mountainous areas.
*** Temperature and humidity have no impact on the terrain itself, and determining only biome placement.
*** Weirdness indirectly drives the PV (peaks and valleys) noise and determines which biome variant gets placed.
** Terrain lists values related to terrain generation.{{Info needed}}

'''Font'''
* Added {{cd|illageralt}}, the rune-like font from ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]''.
** Currently usable only via commands

** Entities, blocks, and fluids are not updated outside of simulation distance.
** Allows higher render distance with less CPU load.

* Now spawn on the surface rather than at a fixed y-level, but tend to be partially buried.

'''[[Dripstone caves]]'''
* Now generate naturally underground and inside hills or mountains.
* Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves.

'''[[Monster room]]s'''
* Increased the amount of dungeons, especially below Y=0.

'''[[Fossil]]s'''
* The fossils in the deepest part of the underground generate with Deepslate Diamond Ore instead of Coal Ore.

'''[[Jungle pyramid]]s'''
* No longer generate on [[water]].

'''[[Lake]]s'''
* Water lakes were removed, because [[aquifer]]s could provide local water levels.
* Lava lakes now generate only above Y=0

'''[[Lush caves]]'''
* Now generate naturally underground and inside hills or mountains.
** [[Azalea tree]]s now generate above lush caves.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* The starting room no longer generates with a dirt floor.
* Now generate higher up in [[badlands]].

'''[[Ocean]]'''
* Ocean biomes temperatures now match land biome temperatures:
** [[Frozen ocean]]s now generate only within [[snowy taiga]]s or [[snowy plains]], as well as [[snowy beach]]es.
** [[Cold ocean]]s now generate only within [[taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, and some [[plains]] and [[forest]]s.
** Normal [[ocean]]s now generate only within [[plains]], [[forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, and [[dark forest]]s.
** [[Lukewarm ocean]]s now generate only within [[savanna]]s, [[jungle]]s, and sometimes [[plains]] and [[forest]]s.
** [[Warm ocean]]s now generate only within [[desert]]s or [[badlands]] and can sometimes spawn in deep waters.
* Completely removed the previously unused [[deep warm ocean]] biomes.

[[File:1-18-ore-distribution.jpg|thumb|450px|Ore distribution changes.]]
'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Changed ore generation of all ores making them have a spread value like [[lapis lazuli ore]]. Some still retain a linear generation alongside a spread generation.
** [[Coal ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of Y=96 and generating between an altitude of Y=0 and Y=192.
** [[Copper ore]] generates between Y=-16 and Y=112, generating the most at Y=48 and like all other ores, uses spread. It peaks at Y=48. Bigger blobs of copper ore generate in dripstone caves.
** [[Iron ore]] attempts to generate three times: once as a spread peaking at an altitude of Y=256, generating above Y=80; another as a spread peaking at Y=16 and generating with a minimum height of Y=-24 and a maximum height of Y=57, and a smaller one spreading evenly between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=-32.
** [[Gold ore]] generates between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=32, peaking at Y=-16. Also, extra gold generates below Y=-48. The extra gold that generates in the [[badlands]] biome was increased, with a top height limit from Y=79 to Y=256, and increased number of blobs.
** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, as a spread between the altitudes of Y=32 and Y=-32, peaking at an altitude of 0; and evenly between the altitudes of Y=64 and Y=-64, generating buried like [[ancient debris]].
** [[Redstone ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=15 and Y=-64; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of -64 and generating below an altitude of Y=-32.
** [[Diamond ore]] now generate as a spread, generating below Y=16 and peaking at depths near Y=-64.
** [[Emerald ore]] generates above Y=-16 as a spread, peaking at Y=256 and decreasing in quantity as the [[altitude]] decreases.
* The size and positioning of diorite, andesite, granite, gravel and dirt has been tweaked - there are larger blobs of these blocks but they're fewer and further apart.
** Diorite, andesite and granite generate less commonly above Y = 60.

'''[[Pillager outpost]]s'''
* Now generate in all the new mountain biomes.

'''[[Spring]]s'''
* Lava springs can now generate amid [[calcite]], [[dirt]], [[snow block]], [[powder snow]] and [[packed ice]].
** These changes allow lava springs to generate in [[mountains]] and snowy terrain.
* Water springs can now generate amid [[dirt]] and [[snow block]], and don't generate higher than Y=192.

'''[[Stony shore]]'''
* Now generate with strips of gravel.
* Can generate alongside any biome instead of just windswept hills.

'''[[Swamp]]'''
* Swamp [[oak]] trees are now able to generate in slightly deeper water than before.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Now slightly more spread out.
* Now generate in [[meadow]]s.

'''General'''
* The [[overworld]] now uses the multi-noise biome source type.
* [[Terrain]] generation is now independent from [[biome]]s, with biomes adapting to whatever [[terrain]] they happen to generate throughout.<ref>{{YouTube link|6Ffu1gTEsVo|Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot|Henrik Kniberg|July 13, 2021|name=}}</ref>
** This allows for natural variation in the terrain of any individual biome, both in terms of shape and elevation.
*** For example, [[forest]]s and [[desert]]s could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that purpose.
** This additionally allows for smoother transitions between biomes.
* Terrain is now smoother and more extreme.
* [[Bedrock]] layers generate dependent on the world seed now.
* New random number generator is used for Overworld generation.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* "Light as a Rabbit" now has "Sweet Dreams" as its parent instead of "Adventure".
* Changed the number of biomes required to visit for the "Adventuring Time" advancement from 42 to 50, due to the removal of sub-biomes and the inclusion of new additions, with the following biomes now being required:

'''[[Weather]]'''
* Sleeping now resets the weather cycle only if the weather is [[rain]] or a [[thunderstorm]].

=== General ===
'''[[Chunk format]]'''
* Chunks {{cd|Level.Sections[].BlockStates}} & {{cd|Level.Sections[].Palette}} have moved to a container structure in {{cd|Level.Sections[].block_states}}.
* Chunks {{cd|Level.Biomes}} are now paletted and live in a similar container structure in {{cd|Level.Sections[].biomes}}.
* Chunks {{cd|Level.CarvingMasks[]}} is now {{cd|long[]}} instead of {{cd|byte[]}}.
* Removed chunks <code>Level</code> and moved everything it contained up.
** <code>Level.Entities</code> has moved to <code>entities</code>.
** <code>Level.TileEntities</code> has moved to <code>block_entities</code>.
** <code>Level.TileTicks</code> and <code>Level.ToBeTicked</code> have moved to <code>block_ticks</code>.
** <code>Level.LiquidTicks</code> and <code>Level.LiquidsToBeTicked</code> have moved to <code>fluid_ticks</code>.
** <code>Level.Sections</code> has moved to <code>sections</code>.
** <code>Level.Structures</code> has moved to <code>structures</code>.
** <code>Level.Structures.Starts</code> has moved to <code>structures.starts</code>.
** <code>Level.Sections[].block_states</code> has moved to <code>sections[].block_states</code>.
** <code>Level.Sections[].biomes</code> has moved to <code>sections[].biomes</code>.
* Added <code>yPos</code> the minimum section y position in the chunk.
* Added <code>below_zero_retrogen</code> containing data to support below zero generation.
* Added <code>blending_data</code> containing data to support blending new world generation with existing chunks.

'''Chunk render pipeline'''
* Changed the prioritization order.

'''[[Cloud]]s'''
* Raised cloud level from 128 to 192.

'''Data generator'''
* <code>--report</code> option now creates full worldgen reference files instead of just biomes.

'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Data pack version number has been increased to 8.

'''[[Effect]]s'''
* Redesigned how effects look in the inventory screen.
** Can display while recipe book is showing.
** The list of effects are now shown to the right of the player's inventory, instead of the left side.
** When the inventory effects list is visible, it is hidden from the game view to reduce screen clutter.
** There are now two effect-list views, compact and classic:
*** Classic is the pre-existing list of effects, one after another.
*** Compact is a single icon for each effect, suitable for small screens.
*** The game automatically switches between the two looks to suit the available screen space.

'''[[Altitude|Height limit]]'''
* Has been increased to 384 blocks, expanding 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, with 319 being the height limit and -64 being the depth limit.

'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Main menu background is changed to reflect [[Caves & Cliffs]]: Part II update.

'''[[Mob spawning]]'''
* The maximum number of monsters spawned is now tracked per player instead of globally.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Sneak, sprint, and auto-jump options have been moved to the "Controls" tab.
* Render distance now causes chunks to load in a cylinder shape around the player instead of a square.
* Changed default brightness to 50.

'''Performance'''
* Now, various background tasks including world generation are executed on a background thread pool.
** The size of the thread pool equals <code>''Amount of available CPU threads'' - 1</code>.
*** Maximum amount of threads is 255, instead of 7. This limit can be overridden by Java system property <code>max.bg.threads</code>.

'''[[World Spawn|Player spawning]]'''
* Reworked world spawn selection algorithm.
** Now spawns according to the same climate parameters that control biome placement and world generation: players should no longer be able to spawn in the ocean or some other inconvenient location.

'''[[Resource pack]]s'''
{{Resource pack format/value|8}}
* Size limit for [[server]] resource packs has been increased from 100 MB to 250 MB.

'''[[Scoreboard]]s'''
* Removed length limits for [[scoreboard]]s, score holders and team names.

'''[[Server]]'''
* {{cd|server.jar}} now bundles individual libraries instead of merging all the files into single archive.
** This change is meant to solve certain problems related to Java modules.
* On startup, {{cd|server.jar}} unpacks libraries into a directory configured by {{cd|bundlerRepoDir}} (default: working directory).
** To run different main class than server, use {{cd|bundlerMainClass}} property.
*** If this property is set to an empty value, the server just validates and extracts files, then exits.
* Server classes are now signed.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* The splash "[this splash text has been delayed until part 2]" has been changed to "[this splash text is now available]".
* The splash "Now Java 16!" has been changed to "Java 16 + 1 = 17!".

'''[[Sprinting]]'''
* No longer reduced to walking when touching the wall at low angles.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Renamed the {{cd|lava_pool_replaceables}} block tag to {{cd|lava_pool_stone_cannot_replace}}.

'''[[Tick]]'''
* Changed some internal details of block and fluid ticking to improve save times.

'''[[Create New World|World creation screen]]'''
* Removed "Caves" and "Floating islands".

'''[[World type]]s'''
* Changed "[[Amplified]]" and "[[Large Biomes]]" types, they have been adapted to the new terrain.
** "Amplified" now has terrain with the following characteristics:
*** Rounded terrain at Y=320, instead of Y=256 previously.
*** Doubled offset above sea level.
*** Greatly increased 3D noise values, resulting in lower factor values inversely.
*** Doubled peak jaggedness.
** "Large Biomes" now has terrain with the following characteristics:
*** Most biomes are four times larger, except mountain peaks and rivers.
*** Multinoise is slowed down by factor 4 for temperature, vegetation, continentalness, and erosion, but not for ridge noise.

'''General'''
* Optimized entity collisions.
* The game now requires Java 17 instead of Java 16.
* Chunks are now saved whenever there is spare time to reduce autosave spikes.
