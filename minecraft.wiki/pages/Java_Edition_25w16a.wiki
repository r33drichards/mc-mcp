'''25w16a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.6]], released on April 15, 2025,<ref>{{snap|25w16a|id=a|April 15, 2025}}</ref> which adds more functionality and improvements to [[lead]]s, technical changes to [[shader]]s, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[POI]]'''
* Added the <code>test_instance</code> POI.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Firework rocket]]'''
* While gliding, using a firework rocket will only be used as a boost even if placed on a block.

'''[[Lead]]'''
* Leashed leads are now rendered twice as thick, to match ''Bedrock Edition''.
* Leads can now be used to leash two mobs together.
** Sneak-interact on any mob while holding a bunch of leashed mobs will leash these mobs to the interacted entity.
** It's not possible to leash anything to itself.
* If the re-leashing an entity would result in immediate leash snapping due to distance, the re-leashing would not happen.
* Leads can be snipped from an entity when interacting them with [[shears]], which consumes their [[durability]].
** This applies to its own leash connection as well as all entities attached to it.
** [[Dispensers]] can now snip leashes from entities in front of them when they are equipped with [[shears]]; this also consumes their [[durability]].
* The leash mechanics were improved, with reworked leash physics, allowing for more stable leash connection, especially when leashed entities are not on ground.
** When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher.
** Using a firework rocket when flying with leashed entities will now break the leash connections.
* When leashing an already leashed mob, the current leash will now snap and a player will re-leash the object to the player.
** It's not possible to steal leashed entities from other players.
* The interactions with a [[leash knot]] and [[fence]] blocks have changed:
** When interacting with a leash knot or a [[fence]], if there are any player-leashed entities in range of the leash knot, they will be re-leashed to the leash knot or a [[fence]].
** In case of attaching of mobs fails due to distance or there is nothing to attach, the player will now transfer all fence leashed entities to itself.
** If there is nothing left attached to the leash knot, it disappears.
** Sneak-interact can only result in attaching of the player mobs to the [[fence]].
** Interacting with [[shears]] or punching the leash knot will result in all current connections broken.
* Boats, as well as large mobs that can be leashed but cannot fit in a boat ([[horses]], [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[camel]]s and [[sniffer]]s), can now be leashed in a special 4-leash configuration to the [[happy ghast]].
** Happy ghast will also present a custom layer when it's leashing something using a quad connection.
** Leashes in quad connection are now rendered without slack.
* Leash snapping distance has been changed from 10 to 12 blocks.
** The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes, rather than their feet is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities.
** Happy ghast leash is now longer - with free roaming distance of 10 blocks and leash snapping at 16 blocks.

=== General ===
'''[[Block models]]'''
* Block model rotations are no longer limited to multiplies of {{cd|22.5}}.
** {{cd|elements[].rotation.angle}} value in block models is no longer limited to multiplies of {{cd|22.5}} degrees and can now be any angle from {{cd|-45}} to {{cd|+45}}.

'''[[Clouds]]'''
* Clouds now exist all the way to the horizon.

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* {{cd|painting/variant}}
** No longer accepts inline variants.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|73}}.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|57}}.
* All core shader uniforms are now uniform blocks.
* The cloud texture ({{cd|clouds.png}}) can no longer be colored.

'''[[Shader]]s'''
* All built-in uniforms are now uniform blocks instead of opaque loose uniforms.
* Custom uniforms provided to post-process shaders are now uniform blocks.
* Uniform definitions inside JSON files are now per-block.
* Post-process effect definitions
** Entries in the targets map have been expanded to support new properties.
*** New optional boolean field: {{cd|persistent}}
**** Default: {{cd|false}}
**** If true, this render target will be persistent across frames.
**** The contents of the target will be cleared when the screen is resized.
*** New optional field: {{cd|clear_color}} 
**** Default: {{cd|[0, 0, 0, 0]}}
**** Format: integer ARGB value, or float array in order {{cd|[R, G, B, A]}}
**** When this target is created or cleared, it will be filled with this color.
** The uniforms values is now a list-per-block, instead of a global list.
*** e.g. <code>uniforms: { "UniformBlockName": [ { "type": "vec2", "value": [...] } ] }</code>
**** The order of uniforms in a block must match the order in the shader.
** {{cd|name}} as part of a uniform definition is no longer used.
** {{cd|value}} as part of a uniform definition replaces the old {{cd|values}}, and the type depends on the {{cd|type}} field.
*** This field is required.
*** {{cd|"type": "int"}} needs {{cd|"value": 123}} (a single int).
*** {{cd|"type": "float"}} needs {{cd|"value": 123.4}} (a single float).
*** {{cd|"type": "vec2"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.2, 3.4]}} (two floats).
*** {{cd|"type": "vec3"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6]}} (three floats).
*** {{cd|"type": "ivec3"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1, 2, 3]}} (three ints).
*** {{cd|"type": "vec4"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]}} (four floats).
*** {{cd|"type": "matrix4x4"}} needs {{cd|"value": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0]}} (four rows of four columns of floats).
* Post-process effect shaders
** Instead of every uniform being an individual opaque type, they are now grouped in uniform blocks.
*** They will be set according to the pass definition in the JSON file, and may be shared across both vertex and fragment shaders.
** The list of sizes (all {{cd|vec2 *Size}} uniforms) are now replaced with a single {{cd|SamplerInfo}} uniform block.
*** This contains, in order, the size of the output texture followed by the size every input texture.
*** The order of textures in the definition file will dictate the order of samplers in this uniform.
*** For most post chains this is just {{cd|OutSize}} and {{cd|InSize}} as before.
*** All sizes are {{cd|vec2}}
* {{cd|post/bits.fsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|BitsConfig}} of {{cd|float Resolution}} and {{cd|float MosaicSize}}.
* {{cd|post/blit.fsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|BlitConfig}} of {{cd|vec4 ColorModulate}}.
* {{cd|post/blur.vsh}} and {{cd|post/box_blur.fsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|BlurConfig}} of {{cd|vec2 BlurDir}} and {{cd|float Radius}}.
* {{cd|post/color_convolve.fsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|ColorConfig}} of {{cd|vec3 RedMatrix}}, {{cd|vec3 GreenMatrix}} and {{cd|vec3 BlueMatrix}}.
* {{cd|post/invert.fsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|InvertConfig}} of {{cd|float InverseAmount}}.
* {{cd|post/rotscale.vsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|RotScaleConfig}} of {{cd|vec2 InScale}}, {{cd|vec2 InOffset}} and {{cd|float InRotation}}.
* {{cd|post/spiderclip.fsh}}
** Expects a {{cd|SpiderConfig}} of {{cd|vec4 Scissor}} and {{cd|vec4 Vignette}}.
* {{cd|Globals}} uniform block
** Available through <samp>#moj_import <minecraft:globals.glsl></samp>
** Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it.
** Contains {{cd|ScreenSize}}, {{cd|GlintAlpha}}, {{cd|GameTime}} and {{cd|MenuBlurRadius}}.
*** {{cd|MenuBlurRadius}} is the blur radius of the background when a menu is open.
* {{cd|Fog}} uniform block
** Available through <samp>#moj_import <minecraft:fog.glsl></samp>
** Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it.
** Contains {{cd|FogColor}}, {{cd|FogShape}}, {{cd|FogStart}}, {{cd|FogEnd}}, {{cd|FogSkyEnd}} and {{cd|FogCloudsEnd}}.
*** {{cd|FogSkyEnd}} is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing for the sky.
*** {{cd|FogCloudsEnd}} is new and represents where the fog should end when drawing the clouds.
*** {{cd|FogEnd}} is the "normal" fog cutoff as before.
** {{cd|FOG_IS_SKY}} is now available to the <samp>position.vsh/position.fsh</samp> shaders when they are rendering for the sky.
* {{cd|Projection}} uniform block
** Available through <samp>#moj_import <minecraft:projection.glsl></samp>
** Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it.
** Contains {{cd|ProjMat}} with no changes.
* {{cd|DynamicTransforms}} uniform block
** Available through <samp>#moj_import <minecraft:dynamictransforms.glsl></samp>
** Is no longer available to shaders that do not normally use it.
** Contains {{cd|ModelViewMat}}, {{cd|ColorModulator}}, {{cd|ModelOffset}}, {{cd|TextureMat}}, {{cd|LineWidth}}.
* {{cd|Lighting}} uniform block
** Available through <samp>#moj_import <minecraft:light.glsl></samp>
** Most shaders are able to receive this uniform block, even if they don't normally use it.
*** The values may not make sense if the shader wouldn't normally expect it, however.
** Contains {{cd|Light0_Direction}} and {{cd|Light1_Direction}}.
* {{cd|CloudInfo}} uniform block
** Only available to the clouds shaders (<samp>rendertype_clouds.vsh/rendertype_clouds.fsh</samp>).
*** Contains {{cd|CloudColor}}, {{cd|CloudOffset}} and {{cd|CellSize}} (new).
**** {{cd|CellSize}} contains the size of an individual cloud cell.
* {{cd|LightmapInfo}} uniform block
** Only available to the lightmap shader (<samp>lightmap.fsh</samp>).
** Contains {{cd|AmbientLightFactor}}, {{cd|SkyFactor}}, {{cd|BlockFactor}}, {{cd|UseBrightLightmap}}, {{cd|NightVisionFactor}}, {{cd|DarknessScale}}, {{cd|DarkenWorldFactor}}, {{cd|BrightnessFactor}}, {{cd|SkyLightColor}} with no change in behavior.

== Fixes ==
