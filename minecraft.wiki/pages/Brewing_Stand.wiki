A '''brewing stand''' is a [[block]] used for [[brewing]] potions using [[water bottle]]s and suitable ingredients. It also serves as a [[cleric]]'s [[job site block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A brewing stand can be mined with anything, but [[pickaxe]]s are the fastest. When broken, it also drops all of its contents.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Brewing Stand|Pickaxe|foot=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Brewing stands generate in [[end ship]]s. They have two [[potion of Healing|Instant Health II potions]] in their holders. 

A brewing stand also generates in the basement of [[igloo]]s with a [[splash potion of Weakness]] in it.

Brewing stands can generate without potions in [[village]] churches.

== Usage ==
[[File:Brewing Stand GUI.png|thumb|right|176px|Brewing stand GUI {{in|java}}]]

By default, the interface of a brewing stand is labeled "Brewing Stand", but this name can be customized by naming it in an [[anvil]] before placing it.

Brewing stands cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s {{in|java}}.

=== Brewing ===
{{main|Brewing}}
The main purpose of brewing stands is to allow for the [[brewing]] of [[potion]]s. Their interface can be opened by pressing {{control|use}} on them.

Brewing stands need [[blaze powder]] as fuel. Each piece brews 20 batches of potions, with each stage of brewing counting separately. A single brew takes 20 seconds (400 [[Tick|ticks]]) to complete. Unlike [[furnace]]s, there is no time limit; fuel is consumed only when there are [[water bottle]]s and an ingredient to brew into it.

Brewing stands interact with [[hopper]]s as follows:

* They accept brewing ingredients from hoppers pointing down into the top.
* Any valid brewing ingredient is pushed into the ingredient slot, regardless of whether it would actually start the brewing process.
* Any valid potion recipe can be preloaded for "hands-free" brewing of a complex recipe, with the [[nether wart]] falling through into the stand for the first step.
* Bottles (including empty bottles) and fuel are accepted from hoppers pointing into the side.
* Finished products can be pulled out by hoppers below, but each stage of brewing counts as a batch of "finished" potions.

{{IN|education}}, elements can be combined in the brewing stand to make the [[medicine]] potions: antidote, elixir, eye drops, and tonic.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a brewing stand has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to cleric and claim the brewing stand as their [[job site block]].

=== Light source ===
Brewing stands emit a light level of 1.{{only|java}}

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Even when the brewing stand is not in use, there is still smoke coming out of the top of it.
* {{IN|Java}}, when a brewing stand is broken, particles from a bottle appear, even if no bottle is in the stand.
* No matter what potion (including water bottles) is in the stand it always looks like a full red bottle.
* Brewing stands always face east, no matter what direction they are placed.
* According to [[Searge]], for thematic reasons, a brewing stand was added to the basement of the [[igloo]]. Because of this, blaze powder was required for fuel to preserve game progression. In this way, the player is prevented from using it before going to the Nether.<ref>https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-blaze</ref>
