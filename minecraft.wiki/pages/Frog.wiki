A '''frog''' is a [[passive mob]] found in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s. It performs large jumps, swims, and uses its long tongue to eat small [[slime]]s and small [[magma cube]]s. [[Froglight]]s are created when frogs eat magma cubes; different frog types create different froglight colors.

== Spawning ==
Frogs spawn in groups of two to five in [[swamp]] and [[mangrove swamp]] biomes. 

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Variants ===
{{Redirect|Frog variant|the definition of frog variants in data packs|Mob variant definitions#Frog}}
Frogs have three variants: temperate, cold, and warm. The variant is determined by the biome the frog spawns in, both naturally and when growing from a [[tadpole]].

Frogs do not naturally spawn within cold biomes, but cold frogs can spawn naturally in a swamp or mangrove swamp bordering a cold biome, and a tadpole can grow up in a cold biome.

;Notes
{{reflist|group=variants}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
Frogs drop {{xp|1|3}} when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].

=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} is dropped upon successful [[breeding]].

== Behavior ==
On land, frogs slowly wander, jumping at random. They can jump up to 8 blocks high and take {{hp|5}} less damage from falling than most other mobs. They prefer jumping on [[lily pad]]s and [[big dripleaves]], and usually jump to places that are higher up. 

In water, frogs swim and move much faster. They generally swim upward and remain at the water's surface, but can swim downward if lured by a player. Frogs do not take [[drowning]] damage.

Occasionally, they may croak and inflate their vocal sac.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Tutorial:Frog farming}}
Frogs follow any player holding a [[slimeball]] within 6 blocks of them. 

Feeding two frogs a slimeball causes them to enter [[breeding|love mode]], causing one of the frogs to become pregnant, similar to [[turtle]]s. The pregnant frog then searches for a water block with at least one adjacent water block (flowing or source) with air above to lay their eggs, known as [[frogspawn]]. After 3-10 minutes, the frogspawn hatches and 2-5 [[tadpoles]] are spawned, which grow into frogs after 20 minutes.

Unlike all other mobs with baby variants, the tadpole is treated by the game as a completely different mob from the frog. 

Furthermore, the biome in which the tadpoles grow into frogs determines their variant type, regardless of their parental variant type, a unique characteristic specific to frogs.

=== Attacking ===
Frogs attack by using their tongue to pull certain mobs into their mouth and eat them, whereupon the mob instantly despawns without a death animation.

Frogs attack small [[slime]]s, which drop [[slimeball]]s when killed.

Frogs also attack small [[magma cube]]s, producing a [[froglight]] block. When a magma cube gets targeted, the frog walks toward it at a faster pace before attacking. The color of froglight that drops depends on the variant of frog that eats the magma cube:

{| class="wikitable"
!Frog variant
!Froglight color
|-
|{{EntitySprite|temperate-frog}} Temperate
|{{BlockSprite|ochre-froglight}} Ochre
|-
|{{EntitySprite|warm-frog}} Warm
|{{BlockSprite|pearlescent-froglight}} Pearlescent
|-
|{{EntitySprite|cold-frog}} Cold
|{{BlockSprite|verdant-froglight}} Verdant
|-
|}
Frogs cannot be harmed by slimes or magma cubes, regardless of their size.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*The warm frog is based on the [[wikipedia:grey foam-nest tree frog|grey foam-nest tree frog]], a real-life species of frog native to Africa.<ref>{{ytl|w6zLprHHZOk|Minecraft Live 2021 @2:08:19|Minecraft|October 16, 2021|t=7699s}}</ref>
*The temperate frog is based on brown [[wikipedia:bullfrog|bullfrogs]].<ref>{{ytl|n9TpuPGH9hk|Minecraft Now: Wild Update and Farlands ft AntVenom! @10:19|Minecraft|May 19, 2022|t=619s}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|n9TpuPGH9hk|Minecraft Now: Wild Update and Farlands ft AntVenom! @12:02|Minecraft|May 19, 2022|t=722s}}</ref>
*Originally, frogs were meant to eat [[Firefly (mob)|fireflies]], but this was scrapped as in real life some fireflies are poisonous to some frogs. Instead, now they can eat small slimes and small magma cubes.<ref>{{tweet|Badgerisi|1478879118766886913|Most fireflies are actually poisonous for frogs, thats why we are currently not having frogs eating fireflies.|January 5, 2022}}</ref>
*During the frog's early development, the developers didn't know what the frog was going to eat, so they made the mouth huge. Some early ideas for what the frog was going to eat included [[bee]]s.<ref>{{Ytl|DAfFKNE6us4|Minecraft 1.19: Secret Sounds & Fabulous Frogs @4:39|Minecraft|t=279s}}</ref>
*At one point in Bedrock Edition's development, in [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.18.10.26|beta 1.18.10.26]], frogs could eat [[goats]]. However, this was later removed as it was leftover prototype code.<ref>{{tweet|Badgerisi|1479030938373955586|I will admit that seeing Frogs eat Goats was extremely hilarious! 😂 It is however not intended and was just some prototype code that was forgotten while developing :) One of the reasons for betas/snaps is to find these small mistakes and fix em <3}}</ref> This was later referenced in the trailer for [[Minecraft Live 2022]], where a frog eats a goat. 
*In ''Minecraft'', all frogs are genderless and have {{w|vocal sac}}s. In real life, only male frogs can have vocal sacs.
*Frogs were first in the 2019 biome vote for swamps, but lost to the Mountains and swamp gained second place, then 2 years later at Minecraft Live 2021 they were announced to be coming to the game, and came to the game part of The Wild Update in 2022 3 years after being declined in the 2019 biome vote.
