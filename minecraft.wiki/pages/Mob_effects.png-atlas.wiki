<samp>'''mob_effects.png-atlas'''</samp> was a procedurally-generated [[texture atlas]] used to store textures for all [[mob effect]]s.

== Format ==

== History ==
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.14|dev=19w08a|Added <samp>textures/mob_effect-atlas</samp>, following the removal of effect icons from <samp>[[inventory.png]]</samp>.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.15|dev=Pre-release 1|Renamed <samp>textures/mob_effect-atlas</samp> to <samp>mob_effects.png-atlas</samp>.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.19.3|dev=22w42a|As an optimization to resource pack loading, everything in the relevant directory is compiled into this atlas, rather than only those sprites which are used by the game. For this specific atlas, there is no resulting visual change.}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=22w46a|A customizable atlas json file has been added which can be used to control which graphics are added to this atlas.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.19.4|dev=Pre-release 3|The way in which sprites are arranged on atlases has been changed considerably, resulting in atlas dimensions being generally smaller.
|This atlas can now be exported to the screenshots folder using F3+S.}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.21.6|dev=25w19a|This atlas has been removed; mob effect icons are now part of <samp>[[gui.png-atlas]]</samp>.}}
