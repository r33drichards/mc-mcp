A '''sniffer egg''' is a [[block]] that can be [[brush]]ed out of [[suspicious sand]] in [[warm ocean ruins]], or obtained by [[breeding]] two [[sniffer]]s. It slowly hatches into a snifflet (baby sniffer) when placed.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Sniffer eggs can be mined with any tool, even with bare hands, and always drop themselves. Unlike turtle eggs, [[Silk Touch]] is not needed.<ref>{{bug|MC-261258||Sniffer eggs do not need to be mined by the Silk Touch enchantment which is different from the turtle eggs|WAI}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Sniffer Egg}}

=== Mob loot ===
Sniffer eggs can also be obtained by [[breeding]] two [[sniffer]]s with [[torchflower seeds]]. Unlike [[turtle egg]]s or [[frogspawn]], which are placed into the world in block form, sniffer eggs are dropped as [[Item (entity)|items]], similar to [[chicken egg]]s.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|sniffer-egg}}

== Usage ==
=== Placing ===
Sniffer eggs can be placed in block form. Once placed, they slowly mature and hatch into snifflets. 

Sniffer eggs do not require a supporting block below.<ref>{{bug|MC-263505||Sniffers eggs don't require support and can float|WAI}}</ref> Unlike [[dragon egg]]s, they are not affected by gravity.

=== Hatching ===
Sniffer eggs crack over time and hatch after cracking twice. They hatch in 10 minutes when placed on [[moss block]]s or 20 minutes when placed on any other block (including [[pale moss block]]s).

Sniffer eggs do not need to receive [[random tick]]s to hatch {{in|java}}. Therefore, the hatching speed of sniffer eggs is not affected by the {{cd|randomTickSpeed}} [[game rule]].<ref>{{bug|MC-261250||Sniffer Eggs are not affected by the "randomTickSpeed" game rule|Invalid}}</ref>

=== Piston interactivity ===
Sniffer eggs can be pushed and pulled by [[piston]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-261168||Sniffer eggs can be pushed and pulled by pistons|WAI}}</ref>
