An '''amber gem''' is an item obtained from fletching [[toxic resin]] in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
[[Toxic resin]] of "jewel" clarity can be turned into amber gems at a [[fletching table]].

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|B2 = Block of Amber
|Output = Amber Gem,9
|ignoreusage=1
}}

== Usage ==
=== Trading ===
In 24w14potato, amber gems replace [[emerald]]s as the primary [[trading]] currency. All villagers, including potato villagers, sell items only for amber gems (although they buy items only for [[poisonous potato]]es).

=== Beacons ===
Amber gems can be used to select powers from a [[beacon]]. The player must select one of the available powers, and then insert a gem into the item slot.

An amber gem can be substituted for an [[iron ingot]], [[gold ingot]] or [[netherite ingot]], an [[emerald]], or a [[diamond]].
