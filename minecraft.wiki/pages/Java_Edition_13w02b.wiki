'''13w02b''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.5]], released on January 11, 2013<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112233709/http://www.mojang.com/2013/01/minecraft-snapshot-13w02b/|title=Minecraft Snapshot 13w02b|website=Mojang.com}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[13w02a]] snapshot.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Activator rail]]s'''
* Changed crafting recipe. 
** Now includes two sticks and a [[redstone torch]], as well as the 6 [[iron ingot]]s. 
* [[Dinnerbone]] stated the previous crafting recipe was not intended.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/16dmm1/minecraft_snapshot_13w03a_released/c7v1rki</ref>

'''[[Chest]]s'''
* Large/double chests can now release a redstone signal when connected to a [[comparator]] depending on the number of stacks within. 
** Before, double chests would only emit a signal depending on how full each individual chest was (a double chest with only the top half full would emit a full signal from the side that the [[item]]s were in).

'''[[Hopper]]s'''
* Powering the block now also stops it from taking in items (see comparison between 13w02a and 13w02b).<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210125181947/https://imgur.com/qogQW,xo2gL#0</ref>

'''[[Trapped chest]]s'''
* Can now transmit signal downward through one [[block]]. This does not apply horizontally (through walls).<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|289738233984741378}}</ref>
