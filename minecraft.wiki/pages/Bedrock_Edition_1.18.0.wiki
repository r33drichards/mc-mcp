'''1.18.0''', the first release of '''[[Caves & Cliffs]]: Part II''', is a major update to {{BE}} released on November 30, 2021.<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4414284658701|title=Minecraft - Caves & Cliffs: Part II - 1.18.0 (Bedrock)|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=November 30, 2021}}</ref> It was first announced alongside the release of the [[Java Edition 1.17]] snapshot [[21w15a]] when [[Mojang Studios]] stated the Caves & Cliffs update would be split in two.<ref>{{snap|21w15a|April 14, 2021}}</ref> Features from 1.18.0 were being developed alongside {{vl|be 1.17.0|}} through [[Experimental Gameplay]]. This is the third major update for Bedrock Edition that is split into several updates since [[Village & Pillage]] in 2019.

== Additions ==
=== Items ===
'''[[File:Music Disc Otherside JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Music Disc]]'''
* Added a new music disc from [[Lena Raine]] titled "otherside".
** Can be found on rare occasions in [[stronghold]] corridor chests, or much more rarely in [[dungeon]] chests.
** Has a blue and green color to the ring area of the disc.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:EnvSprite cave.png|16px]] [[Cave]]s'''
* Completely overhauled.
* Now stretch down to Y=-64.
* The caves now generate in 2 layers of different stone bases depending on the depth.
** The layer above Y=9 is made up of regular [[stone]].
** Stone transitions to [[deepslate]] from Y=8 to Y=0.
** Deepslate completely replaces stone from Y=0 to [[bedrock]].
*** Certain types of ores and structures still generate in the deepslate layer, as well as [[tuff]] and [[gravel]].
*** [[Dirt]], [[diorite]], [[granite]] and [[andesite]] do not generate in this layer.
* Biomes such as the [[dripstone caves]] and [[lush caves]] now generate in the underground.
* Contain [[aquifers]], bodies of [[water]] with different heights, independent of sea level (Y=63).
** Aquifers below Y=0 sometimes generate with lava instead of water.
* Improved old caves to blend in with the new generations of caves better
* New noise caves, coming in 3 forms, "cheese", "spaghetti", and "noodle".
** Cheese caves have large stone towers stretching from the bottom of the cave to the top, and are often large enough to allow safe elytra flight.
** Spaghetti caves are long, thin caves that have small aquifers and are more similar to original caves.
** Noodle caves are thinner, squigglier, and more claustrophobic variants of spaghetti caves.

'''[[File:EnvSprite mountain.png|16px]] [[Mountains]]'''
* Comes in 6 sub-biomes:
**[[File:BiomeSprite meadow.png|16px]] [[Meadow]]
*** A grassy elevated biome that looks like a flowery and colder [[plain]]s, with an aqua [[grass]] color and dark blue water color.
*** Generates in plateaus and the lowest layers of some mountains, usually near plains and other temperate biomes.
*** Contains [[grass]], [[tall grass]], [[dandelion]]s, [[azure bluet]]s, [[cornflower]]s, [[flower|poppies]], [[flower|daisies]] and [[allium]]s

*** Pillager outposts can generate in this biome.
** [[File:BiomeSprite stony-peaks.png|16px]] [[Stony Peaks]]
*** One of three biomes that generate in the mountain peaks.
*** Covered in [[stone]], [[gravel]], and strips of [[calcite]].
*** Tends to generate in any peak surrounded by warm biomes such as [[jungle]]s and [[savanna]]s, to avoid temperature clashes.
*** No animals spawn in this biome.
*** Pillager outposts can generate in this biome.

'''[[File:EnvSprite ore-vein.png|16px]] [[Ore vein]]s'''
* Long and rare [[ore]] formations.
* [[Copper ore]] veins mixed with [[granite]] and [[raw copper block|blocks of raw copper]] generate above Y=0.
* [[Iron ore]] veins mixed with [[tuff]] and [[raw iron block|blocks of raw iron]] generate below Y=0.

'''[[Magma Block]]s'''
* Slightly increased the frequency of underwater magma.

'''[[Stonecutter]]'''
* [[Block of Copper]] can be converted to 4 Cut Copper using stonecutter.

'''General'''
* [[Block light]] level now must be 0 for [[Light#Mobs|many hostile mobs]] to spawn (the [[sky light]] can still prevent these mobs from spawning like before).<ref>{{tweet|_Ulraf_|1414985600273428480|Some more information about: "Monsters will only spawn in complete darkness" * This means that generic monster spawning is now only in complete darkness. (Mobs that have special rules like slimes or phantoms are unaffected by this) * This only affects block-light, not sky-light}}</ref>

=== World generation ===
'''[[Amethyst Geode]]s'''
* Now generate up to Y=30.

'''[[Badlands]]'''
* Now can generate in mountain peaks.
* Red sand generates a bit higher.

'''[[Beach]]es'''
* Beaches are generally wider.
** In some places there is a chance where no beaches generate at all, to provide some variation.

'''[[Biomes]]'''
* Because the terrain height is no longer controlled by biomes, the following sub-biomes no longer generate naturally and become unused in the game:
:{| class="wikitable collapsible collapsed"
! Unused biomes
|-
| {{BiomeLink|Badlands Plateau}}

* Now generate naturally underground and inside hills or mountains.
* Drowned can spawn in aquifers inside dripstone caves.

'''[[Dungeon]]s'''
* Increased the amount of dungeons, especially below Y=0.

** [[Azalea tree]]s now generate above lush caves.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Mineshaft pieces no longer generate if they were fully floating in the air.

* Cobwebs no longer generate floating without an adjacent block.
* Now generate higher up in [[badlands]].

** [[Frozen ocean]]s now generate only within [[snowy taiga]]s or [[Snowy Tundra|snowy plains]], as well as [[snowy beach]]es.
** [[Cold ocean]]s now generate only within [[taiga]]s, [[Giant Tree Taiga|old growth taigas]] and some [[plains]] and [[forest]]s.

** [[Lukewarm ocean]]s now generate only within [[savanna]]s, [[jungle]]s and sometimes [[plains]] and [[forest]]s.
** [[Warm ocean]]s now generate only within [[desert]]s or [[badlands]].
** [[Warm ocean]] biomes now generate in deep waters.

[[File:1-18-ore-distribution.jpg|thumb|450px|Ore distribution changes.]]
'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Changed ore generation of all ores making them have a spread value like [[lapis lazuli ore]]. Some still retain a linear generation alongside a spread generation.
** Coal ore attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=136 and Y=256; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of Y=96 and generating between an altitude of Y=0 and Y=192.
** [[Copper ore]] generates between Y=-16 and Y=112, generating the most at Y=48 and like all other ores, uses spread. It peaks at Y=48. Bigger blobs of copper ore generate in dripstone caves.
** [[Iron ore]] attempts to generate three times: once as a spread peaking at an altitude of Y=256, generating above Y=80; another as a spread peaking at Y=16 and generating with a minimum height of Y=-24 and a maximum height of Y=57, and a smaller one spreading evenly between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=-32.
** [[Gold ore]] generates between the altitudes of Y=-64 and Y=32, peaking at Y=-16. Also, extra gold generates below Y=-48. The extra gold that generates in the [[badlands]] biome was increased, with a top height limit from Y=79 to Y=256, and increased number of blobs.
** [[Lapis lazuli ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, as a spread between the altitudes of Y=32 and Y=-32, peaking at an altitude of 0; and evenly between the altitudes of Y=64 and Y=-64, generating buried like [[ancient debris]].
** [[Redstone ore]] attempts to generate twice: once, evenly between an altitude of Y=15 and Y=-64; and as a spread, peaking at an altitude of -64 and generating below an altitude of Y=-32.
** [[Diamond ore]] now generate as a spread, generating below Y=16 and peaking at altitudes near Y=-64.
** [[Emerald ore]] generates above Y=-16 as a spread, peaking at Y=256 and decreasing in quantity as the [[altitude]] decreases.

'''[[Pillager outpost]]s'''
* Now generate in all the new mountain biomes.

'''[[Spring]]s'''
* Lava springs can now generate amid [[calcite]], [[dirt]], [[snow]], [[powder snow]] and [[packed ice]].
** These changes allow lava springs to generate in [[mountains]] and snowy terrain.
* Water springs don't generate higher than Y=192, and are less common.

'''[[Stony Shore]]'''
* Now generate with strips of gravel.
* Can generate alongside any biome instead of just extreme hills.

'''[[Stronghold]]s'''
* Now try to generate fully encased in [[stone]], or [[deepslate]] at low y-levels.

'''[[Village]]s'''
* Now generate in [[Mountain#Meadows|meadows]].

'''General'''
* The [[overworld]] now uses the multi-noise biome source type.
* [[Terrain]] generation is now independent from [[biome]]s, with biomes adapting to whatever [[terrain]] they happen to generate throughout.<ref>{{YouTube link|6Ffu1gTEsVo|Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot|Henrik Kniberg|July 13, 2021|name=}}</ref>
** This allows for natural variation in the terrain of any individual biome, both in terms of shape and elevation.
*** For example, [[forest]]s and [[desert]]s could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that purpose.
** This additionally allows for smoother transitions between biomes.
* Terrain is now smoother and more extreme.
* New random number generator is used for overworld generation.

=== Gameplay ===


'''[[Patrol|Patrols]]'''
*[[Vindicator]]s can no longer spawn in patrols.

'''[[Raid]]s'''
*Changed raid boss bar colour from pink to red.
*Raid mobs now despawn after a raid ends if the players move too far away

'''[[Status effects]]'''
*Hero of the Village effect now applies to all players who helped kill a raider once a raid is defeated, and the effect remains on the players, even if they travel outside the village.

=== General ===
'''Android External Storage'''
* Players with external storage will be migrated to the new location at startup, due to storage changes required by Google.
** Players can still play if the migration fails by closing the results window.

'''[[Cloud]]s'''
* Raised cloud level from 128 to 192.

'''[[Altitude|Height limit]]'''
* Has been increased to 384 blocks, expanding 64 blocks up and 64 blocks down, with 319 being the height limit and -64 being the depth limit.

'''[[Title Screen|Menu screen]]'''
* Main menu background is changed to reflect [[Caves & Cliffs|Caves & Cliffs]]: Part II update.

'''[[Create New World|World creation screen]]'''
* Removed the [[Old]] world types.
** Existing world with old world types are still playable, but do not get updated with 1.18 features.
