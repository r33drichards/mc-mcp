== Obtaining ==

=== Witches ===

Witches drop Potions of Healing, Fire Resistance, Swiftness and Water Breathing, but only when they die while drinking that potion.

=== Fishing ===

Water bottles may be caught as junk when [[fishing]].

=== Filling bottles ===

Using a [[glass bottle]] on water source block or a [[cauldron]] will turn it into a water bottle. Using a glass bottle on a cauldron will also lower the water level of that cauldron by 1/3.

=== Brewing ===
{{main|Brewing}}

Almost all potions can be obtained by [[brewing]], starting with the water bottle as the base.

== Usage ==

Potions have a different effect according to their damage value, with the exception of reverted potions being identical to their base potions.

Potions can be used by pressing and holding {{control|use}}, similarly to eating food. Upon using, they will apply the corresponding [[status effect]] to the player.

=== Tiers ===
{{main|Brewing}}

Potions have four tiers, those being base, extended, level II, and reverted. On most potions, extended is obtained by adding a piece of [[redstone]] to the potion in the brewing stand, while level II requires a [[glowstone dust]]. If an extended potion receives a glowstone dust, or a level II potion receives a piece of redstone, it will change to the other effect if available, or become a reverted potion.

Most potions can also be "corrupted" using a [[fermented spider eye]]s, which usually inverts the effect (for example: Swiftness to Slowness). Corrupted potions have the same four tiers as normal potions, and tiers are usually kept after corruption.

=== Base potions ===

Base potions are potions that are created first to brew into other potions. Base potions have no effect when you drink them.

=== Unbrewable potions ===

This class of potions exist in the game code and are functional, but cannot be brewed. They are extended and empowered versions of existing potions, but the brewing process normally only allows for one of the two to take precedence. Thus, these potions result from custom data values that place both effects on the potion. The data values for these potions are essentially the values of the original potions added by 96 (e.g. the data value for Potion of Strength (8201) + 96 = 8297 (the data value of Potion of Strength II (extended))) See the table below for the complete set of what is included.

=== Unused potions ===

There are thirty unused potions that were left behind in {{verlink|Beta 1.9-pre2}}. All unused potions have no effect and appear to be re-textures of other potions. Below is a list of their names and values.

These potions can only be obtained by using the command {{cmd|give <target> minecraft:potion 1 <data-value> {CustomPotionEffects:[]} }}. Adding a multiple of 64 to the value will result in the same potion. As with other potions, adding the value with 16384 will result in a splash version of given potion. 

''Values with a '''*''' do not require <code>{CustomPotionEffects:[]}</code> at the end of the command.''

(r) = Reverted Potion

* Bits 0-3 (1, 2, 4 and 8) determine the potion effect. The highest legitimately available is currently 14 <small>decimal</small> = 1110 <small>binary</small>.
* Bits 0-5 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) determine the potion's name.
* Bits 5 (32) and 6 (64) determine the potion's modifier.
** If bit 5 is true, the potion is a level II potion (or, in some cases, a reverted potion).
** If bit 6 is true, the potion is an extended potion (or, in some cases, a reverted potion).
** Potions with bits 5 ''and'' 6 set to true cannot be brewed, but if obtained through commands or other means, will appear and function as level II and/or extended, depending on which modifiers the effect supports.
* Bits 13 and 14 (8192 and 16384) determines whether the potion is a drinkable potion or a splash potion. If bit 13 is true, it's drinkable. If 14 is true, it's a splash potion.
** Potions with bits 13 ''and'' 14 set to false cannot be brewed, but if obtained through commands or other means, they will appear and function as drinkable potions.
* Bits 7-12 and 15 are ignored, thus many potions with distinct data values will have the same properties.
