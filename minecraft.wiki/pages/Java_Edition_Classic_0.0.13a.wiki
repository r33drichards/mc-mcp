[[Java Edition Classic 0.0.13a/Development#World size test (1) (May 21, 2009)|An early development version of 0.0.13a]], mislabelled as its released counterpart, is available in the launcher. It was used for testing the world size, and can only generate flat terrain, instead of the actual terrain used in the full release. Many features from [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.12a|0.0.12a]] are still present, such as using the "generating level" screen from that version instead of the one from 0.0.13a.

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Added a thin black block selection outline.
** This causes a bug where the white overlay vanishes when very close to a block on one or more of its sides.
* Pressing {{key|Esc}} now opens the pause menu.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Lava JE2.png|32px]] [[Lava]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Lava JE1.png|32px]].
* Is no longer transparent.
* The mist underneath lava is now a thick red, instead of the previous shade of orange.

'''[[File:Oak Sapling JE2.png|32px]] [[Sapling]] '''
* Changed the texture from [[File:Oak Sapling JE1.png|32px]].

'''[[File:Water JE2.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Water JE1.png|32px]].

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Player]]'''
* Player jump height reduced to its [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.11a|0.0.11a]] value.
* Swimming and sinking down in water is now much faster.

=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Surface dirt layer is more uniform. 
** There is almost always a layer of grass with dirt under it above stone.
** Cliff faces can no longer be made of pure dirt and grass.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Holding down {{key|R}} no longer causes the player to cycle between different locations - holding the key now has the same effect as simply pressing it.
* Holding the {{ctrl|jump}} key no longer allows for auto jumping.

=== General ===
'''[[Menu screen]]s'''
* The world generating screen now shows darker dirt.

'''Resolution'''
* Changed the game's resolution from 640×480 to 854×480.</onlyinclude>

== Technical ==
'''Levels'''
* Added level saving for players with accounts.<ref>[[wordofnotch:111554130|"minecraft.net goes live, and you can save your levels now!"]] – The Word of Notch.</ref>
** Feature for registered and logged in players only.
** Five slots in total.
** Could be played at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?name=<username>&id=<the slot saved in, starting from 0></nowiki></code>.

== Fixes ==
'''4 bugs fixed'''
* The block being used is once again shown in the top right corner.
* Fixed textures touching the top and bottom of the map not being shown.
* The terrain is no longer always generated a block above water.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''(22:12:23) <Notch_> it's fixed in 0.0.13a. =)''" (20:12 UTC)</ref>
* Lava and water now always produce stone.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''(16:29:51) fartron: Notch_, how can lava float on water without forming stone? [...] Notch_: it can't in 0.0.13a. :D''" (14:29 UTC)</ref>

== Bugs ==
'''3 bugs reported'''
* Transparency issue with water.<ref>{{link|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg203338#msg203338|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=TIGSource Forums|author=[[Markus Persson]]|date=May 22, 2009|quote=That transparency thing looks like a bug!}}</ref>
* Level saving sometimes does not work.<ref>{{link|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg203341#msg203341|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=TIGSource Forums|author=Baltirow|date=May 22, 2009|quote=The added saving feature doesn't seem to work in the last version (v0.013 something).}}</ref>
** The reason is because Opera and older versions of Java did not support a workaround Notch made to allow connecting to a host from an applet in LWJGL.<ref>{{link|url=https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273.msg203362#msg203362|title=Minecraft (alpha)|website=TIGSource Forums|author=[[Markus Persson]]|date=May 22, 2009}}</ref>
* When facing at certain angles, a block can be placed where a block already is.
