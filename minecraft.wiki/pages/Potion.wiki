'''Potions''' are bottled consumable liquids that give [[effect]]s for a certain amount of time when drunk. They are primarily obtained from [[brewing]]. Every potion is brewed starting from a [[water bottle]], which is considered a type of potion that has no effects.

== Obtaining ==
=== Brewing ===
{{main|Brewing}}

Almost all potions are obtained by [[brewing]].

The [[potion of Luck]]{{only|java|short=1}} and the [[potion of Decay]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} cannot be brewed. They can be obtained via commands, and are also available in the [[Creative inventory]] in their respective editions.

=== Mob loot ===
A [[witch]] has an 8.5% chance to drop a [[potion of Healing]], [[Potion of Fire Resistance|Fire Resistance]], [[Potion of Swiftness|Swiftness]], or [[Potion of Water Breathing|Water Breathing]] if it dies while drinking one of them.

A [[wandering trader]] also has an 8.5% chance to drop a [[potion of Invisibility]] if killed while drinking it.

=== Generated loot ===
Two [[potions of Healing II]] can be found in the brewing stand on end ships in [[end cities]].

One splash [[potion of Weakness]] can be found in the [[brewing stand]] inside every [[igloo]] basement.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, the cauldron in a [[swamp hut]] contains 1 to 3 bottles of a random potion. There is a 25% chance for a [[potion of Healing]] or [[Potion of Poison|Poison]], 15% for [[Potion of Swiftness|Swiftness]], 10% for [[Potion of Slowness|Slowness]], [[Potion of Weakness|Weakness]], or [[Potion of Water Breathing|Water Breathing]], and 5% for [[Potion of Fire Resistance|Fire Resistance]].

{{LootChestItem|potion-of-regeneration,potion-of-swiftness,potion-of-water-breathing,potion-of-healing,potion-of-strength}}

=== Bartering ===
When given a [[gold ingot]], [[piglin]]s have a {{frac|10|469}} (~2.13%) chance to [[barter]] a water bottle, a {{frac|8|469}} (~1.71%) chance to barter a [[potion of Fire Resistance]], and a {{frac|8|469}} (~1.71%) to barter a [[Splash Potion of Fire Resistance|splash potion of Fire Resistance]].

=== Fishing ===
[[Water bottles]] can be [[fishing|fished]] up as junk items.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s can sell 1 extended [[potion of Invisibility]] for 5 [[emerald]]s.

=== Cauldrons ===
{{Main|Glass Bottle}}
A glass bottle can be {{control|used}} on a filled [[cauldron]] to fill it with water, making a [[water bottle]]. This drops the water level in the cauldron by one. {{IN|BE}}, a cauldron can hold 1 to 3 bottles of any potion, which can be picked up by the same method to fill the bottle with the corresponding potion.

=== Water ===
A glass bottle can also be {{control|used}} on a [[water]] source block to fill it with water. This does not affect the water source block.

== Usage ==
Potions are used by pressing and holding {{control|use}} with the potion bottle in hand, as with all consumable items. When consumed, they bestow the corresponding [[status effect]] upon the player and return a [[glass bottle]].

Drinking a potion while already under the effects of the same potion does not add onto the effect's duration, but simply resets it. A potion effect does not "downgrade" if a lower level is activated. For example, if a [[player]] has [[Regeneration]] II, drinking a regular potion of Regeneration does not have any effect.

=== Modifiers ===
{{main|Brewing}}

Potions can be modified in five ways.
# Adding [[glowstone dust]] into certain potions enhances their level of effect.
# Adding [[redstone]] extends the duration of the effect.
# Adding [[gunpowder]] into a potion makes it a [[splash potion]] (area effect).
# Adding [[dragon's breath]] to a splash potion makes it a [[lingering potion]] (area effect that lingers on the ground).
# Adding a [[fermented spider eye]] into specific potions modifies their effect, usually inverting it; this is referred to as "corruption".

The modifications of enhancement and extension are mutually exclusive.

Enhancing most potions trades some of its duration for a bigger effect. For example, the base [[potion of Regeneration|Regeneration]] lasts for 44 seconds whereas Regeneration II lasts for only 22 seconds but heals more per tick during that time.

Extending a potion generally makes it last {{frac|8|3}} times as long as its base potion, so a duration of 3 minutes becomes 8 minutes.

==== Corruption ====
The usual result of corruption is to invert the potion's effect (for example [[Potion of Swiftness|Swiftness]] becomes [[Potion of Slowness|Slowness]]). However:
* Corrupting [[potion of Poison]] (a continuous damage effect) creates a [[potion of Harming]] (an instant damage effect) instead of [[Potion of Regeneration|Regeneration]] (a continuous healing effect).
* Corrupting a [[potion of Night Vision]] turns it into a [[potion of Invisibility]] instead of [[Blindness]] or [[Darkness]].

Corrupting an extended or enhanced potion results in a corrupted potion with the same modifier, if it is supported by the corrupted effect. The only exception to this is the enhanced potion of Slowness, which cannot be brewed by corrupting an enhanced potion of Swiftness or Leaping. All of the corrupted potions except Harming can be extended, but only Harming and Slowness can be enhanced.

=== Base potions ===
Base potions are potions that have no effect when the player drinks them, but are necessary as the basis for other potions.

=== Undead mobs ===
The effects given by potions of Healing and Harming are reversed on [[undead]] mobs. Potions of Healing deal damage, and Harming heals them. In addition, undead mobs are not affected by Poison or Regeneration.

{{IN|bedrock}}, hitting an undead mob with a Regeneration Potion always registers as Regeneration I, no matter the level of the used potion.

=== Mud conversion ===
Using a water bottle, splash water bottle, or lingering water bottle on [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], or [[rooted dirt]] converts it into [[mud]], returning a [[glass bottle]] with it. This process can be automated with a [[dispenser]].

=== Filling cauldrons with potions ===
{{IN|Bedrock}}, using a potion bottle on a [[cauldron]] empties the potion into it and fills the cauldron by {{frac|1|3}} of its capacity. Using a glass bottle on a cauldron filled with a potion drains it by {{frac|1|3}} and fills the bottle. A single cauldron can store up to three potions of the same type. Different potions cannot be combined in a cauldron, nor can they be mixed with any other substance. [[Arrow]]s can be also [[Tipped Arrow|tipped]] when used on a cauldron containing potion. A single portion of potion can tip 16 arrows at once, while a full cauldron can tip a stack of arrows at once.

=== Uncraftable potion ===
{{IN|JE}}, the uncraftable potion is a potion with no effect that is unobtainable in [[Survival]]. It is also available in splash potion and lingering potion forms, as well as for tipped arrows.

Uncraftable potions have the same texture as [[water bottle]]s.

It can be obtained using the following command: {{command|give @s minecraft:potion}}. It is also obtained when a potion has invalid or missing potion effect tags, and thus serves as a placeholder.

== Custom effects ==
{{Main|Data component format#potion contents}}
{{IN|java}}, potions can also be obtained with any status effect using {{cmd|give}} and the <code>potion_contents</code> data component.

{{HistoryTable

|{{HistoryLine||1.0.0|dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2|Added [[effect]]s.
|Implemented [[cauldron]]s, used to brew potions<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|119466949708222465|Potions are delayed because *add to cauldron, pick up, look at tooltip, pour back into cauldron, repeat* was extremely tedious|September 29, 2011}}</ref> by filling them with water and adding a series of ingredients. They were ultimately disabled in this release due to dissatisfaction with the feature, making brewing inaccessible without using a mod to assign them a block ID.
|Added glass bottles. Their only use is collecting potions from cauldrons.
|Added potions. They stack to 64 and can have multiple effects, including negative effects, depending on the ingredients used to make them. They are always given one of [[Java Edition removed items#Beta 1.9 Prerelease 2 potions|32 generic names]], with their actual effects being listed in their tooltip.
|In total, there are 161 possible potion combinations and 2,653 different types of potions.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|120520408792432641|In the prerelease, there are 161 brewable unique potions. Unless we change it, there will be 2,653 with all ingredients added.|October 2, 2011}}</ref>
|[[Jeb]] later tweeted that both [[Notch]] and he had come up with a different way to brew potions, which was revealed to be brewing stands.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|119710836469149697|A quick discussion with @notch led me in on a new way of doing the potion brewing. Cauldron is out...|September 30, 2011}}</ref>}}
|{{HistoryLine|||dev=Beta 1.9 Prerelease 3|Added [[water bottle]]s, created by using a glass bottle on water or on a filled cauldron.
|Potions can no longer stack. Only empty bottles can be stacked to 64.
|Added [[brewing stand]]s, replacing the scrapped cauldron-based brewing mechanic. Potions are now obtainable. Potions brewed in the previous version are now glitched.
|Cauldrons are now properly accessible, but most of their previous functionality is removed. Instead of holding potions, they can only hold water.
|Added potions of [[Potion of Swiftness|Swiftness]], [[Potion of Slowness|Slowness]], [[Potion of Strength|Strength]], [[Potion of Weakness|Weakness]], [[Potion of Healing|Healing]], [[Potion of Harming|Harming]], [[Potion of Regeneration|Regeneration]], [[Potion of Fire Resistance|Fire Resistance]], and [[Potion of Poison|Poison]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*When a player drinks two potions by quickly switching to another potion immediately after drinking one, the second drinking animation is not shown.{{verify|type=current|Still in recent versions?}}
*A [[potion of Poison]] II lasts for 22.5 seconds, but it is displayed as 22 seconds because the [[item]] hover display shows rounded-down integer values.
*The "Local Brewery" [[advancement]] uses the uncraftable potion texture for its icon.

== Unused potions ==
''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' has [[History of textures/Unused textures#Unused potions|unused potion textures]] for several [[effect]]s, along with their [[Splash Potion#Unused splash potions|splash variants]]. These effects are: [[Absorption]], [[Blindness]], [[Haste]], [[Health Boost]], [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]], [[Mining Fatigue]], [[Nausea]], [[Resistance]], [[Saturation (effect)|Saturation]], and [[Levitation]], as well as the [[Luck]] potion textures also present in ''[[Java Edition]]''. These unused textures were added along with the other potion textures in [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha]], except for the potion of Levitation, which was added in [[Pocket Edition 1.0.0]]. The textures were changed along with the other potion textures during the [[texture update]] in [[Bedrock Edition 1.10.0]]. Strangely, the potion of levitation texture is a duplicate of the splash potion of levitation texture.
