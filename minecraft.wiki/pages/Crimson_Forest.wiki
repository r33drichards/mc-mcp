The '''crimson forest''' is a forested [[biome]] in [[the Nether]]. It is one of [[Warped Forest|two]] Nether biomes where players are able to acquire [[Wood (disambiguation)|wood]] without returning to the Overworld.

== Description ==
The crimson forest is the second most common Nether biome, making up 22% of the Nether by volume, and can generate next to any other Nether biome except for the [[basalt deltas]].

Crimson forests are dense and have a crimson color scheme. The forest's fog is dark red and blazing particles are seen floating. [[Piglin]]s are often seen in this biome in groups of 3-4. [[Zombified piglin]]s also spawn, but in fewer numbers, and [[strider]]s appear in lava lakes that generated within the biome. This is the only biome where [[hoglin]]s naturally spawn outside of [[bastion remnant]]s.

The forest floor is mostly covered with [[crimson nylium]], with some [[netherrack]] and [[Nether wart block]]s generating on the surface as well. The most frequent vegetation of the biome includes [[crimson fungi]], [[crimson roots]] and [[huge crimson fungi]], along with [[weeping vines]] that hang from the large fungi and Nether wart blocks from the ceiling, and lone [[shroomlight]]s that provide light within the huge fungi. [[Warped fungi]], though less common, also occasionally generate, naturally keeping hoglins away from affected areas. Just like in the rest of the Nether biomes, [[fire]] and [[lava]] are very common, with the latter appearing as [[lava spring]]s or whole lava lakes. [[Glowstone blob]]s also spawn on the ceiling like normal. 

[[Nether fortress]]es can generate in this biome, along with bastion remnants and [[ruined portal]]s.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:

== Trivia ==
* When the crimson forest was announced at [[MINECON Live 2019]], which happened before the first Nether Update snapshot was released, it was known as "Nether wart forest". In the announcement, however, it was called "Nether wart forest red".
* Most of the ambience in the crimson forest was made with balloons, which [[Samuel Åberg]] says creates a disturbing feeling of something stretching and forcing itself to bend.<ref>{{ytl|BPJOs8nFMv0|Dev Diaries #2: Nether Sound|Minecraft|July 24, 2020|t=43}}</ref>
* The crimson forest's music track, Chrysopoeia, is named after {{w|Chrysopoeia|a term in alchemy}} that refers to the transmutation of base metals into gold.
