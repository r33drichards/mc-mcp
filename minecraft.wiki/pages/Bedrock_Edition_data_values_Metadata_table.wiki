The tables shows all blocks and items with their associated metadata or damage values respectively in the current ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' version.

=== [[Planks]] ===

{{dvt|sprite=dirt|[[Dirt]]}}
{{dvt|sprite=coarse-dirt|[[Coarse Dirt]]|foot=1}}

=== [[Sapling]]s ===
Alias IDs only.
The data value is split in half. The bottom three bits determine the type of sapling (and thus the eventual tree type), according to the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! Bits !! Values
|-
| 0x1<br>0x2<br>0x4 || A three-bit field storing a value of 0 to 5 specifying the type of sapling:
*0: {{BlockSprite|Oak Sapling}} Oak Sapling
*1: {{BlockSprite|Spruce Sapling}} Spruce Sapling
*2: {{BlockSprite|Birch Sapling}} Birch Sapling
*3: {{BlockSprite|Jungle Sapling}} Jungle Sapling
*4: {{BlockSprite|Acacia Sapling}} Acacia Sapling
*5: {{BlockSprite|Dark Oak Sapling}} Dark Oak Sapling
|-
| 0x8 || Set if sapling is ready to grow into a tree.
|}

The 0x8 bit functions as the counter. The counter is cleared when a sapling is dropped as an item.

=== [[Water]] and [[Lava]] ===
If bit 0x8 is set, this liquid is "falling" and only spreads downward. At this level, the lower bits are essentially ignored, since this block is then at its highest fluid level.

The lower three bits are the fluid block's level. 0x0 is the highest fluid level (not necessarily filling the block - this depends on the neighboring fluid blocks above each upper corner of the block). Data values increase as the fluid level of the block drops: 0x1 is next highest, 0x2 lower, on through 0x7, the lowest fluid level. Along a line on a flat plane, water drops one level per meter from the source, lava drops one in the nether and two everywhere else.

The stationary versions of each fluid are "stable" and currently not being checked by the engine for further level changes. Oddly the in-code names for stationary water and lava are "water" and "lava" and the regular versions are "flowing_water" and "flowing_lava".

=== [[Sand]] ===
Alias IDs only.
{{dvt|spritetype=block|sprite=sand|Sand}}

*1: {{BlockSprite|Acacia Log Horizontal}} Facing East/West
*2: {{BlockSprite|Acacia Log Top}} Facing North/South
|}

=== [[Leaves]] ===
If bit 0x4 is set, the leaves are permanent and will never decay. This bit is set on player-placed leaf blocks and overrides the meaning of bit 0x8.

If bit 0x8 is set, the leaves will be checked for decay. The bit will be cleared after the check if the leaves do not decay. The bit will be set again whenever a block adjacent to the leaves is changed.

=== [[Fire]] ===
0x0 is a placed or spread fire. Once it reaches 0xF the eternal fire-trick will work since there will be no further updates of the block.

For normal sandstone the bottom has a cracked pattern. The other types of sandstone have bottom faces
same as the tops.

=== [[Mushroom Block|Brown and red mushroom blocks]] ===
Mushroom blocks consist of the same blocks throughout their structure, the data value of each block decides the texture. The default texture on all sides is porous flesh. The cap texture can be either the brown mushroom or red mushroom texture, the textures for porous and stem sides are identical. Although data values 11-13 are unused they have the same texture as data value 0 as placeholders (to keep people from destroying their maps).

=== [[Pumpkin seeds|Pumpkin stem]] and [[Melon seeds|Melon stem]] ===
{| class="wikitable"

| 7 || Seventh stage of growth<br>In this stage a stem can generate a melon or pumpkin next to<br>it on an empty dirt, grass or farmland block
|}

=== [[Vines]] ===
Determines the face against which the vine is anchored. Note that (except for Top) these are testable as bit flags, unlike most of the other directional data for other block types. Multiple sides can contain vines. The "top" attachment is assumed to be present if data is 0 or there is solid block above.
* 1: south
* 2: west
* 4: north
* 8: east

=== [[Fence Gate]]s ===
[[File:Fence gate orientation bits.png|thumb|The left circle was opened from the outside, the right one from the inside. Facing directions: Red = North; Green = East; Yellow = South; Blue = West]]

{| class="wikitable"
! Bits !! Description
|-
| 0x1<br>0x2 || Two bits storing a value from 0 to 3 specifying the direction the gate is facing:
*0: Facing south
*1: Facing west
*2: Facing north
*3: Facing east
|-
| 0x4 || 0 if the gate is closed, 1 if open.
|}

=== [[Nether Wart]] ===
Like Crops, the data value is related to the size of the Nether Wart. There are three distinct visual stages to Nether Wart's growth (the associated data values are given):

{| class="wikitable"
! Icon !! Value
|-
|{{BlockSprite|nether-wart-1}}|| 0
|-
|{{BlockSprite|nether-wart-2}}|| 1-2
|-
|{{BlockSprite|nether-wart-3}}|| 3
|}

=== [[Brewing Stand]] ===
The bottom three bits are bit flags for which bottle slots actually contain bottles.

{| class="wikitable" data-description="Block data"
! Bits !! Values
|-
| 0x1 || The slot pointing east
|-
| 0x2 || The slot pointing northwest
|-
| 0x4 || The slot pointing southwest
|}

=== [[Cauldron]] ===
The data value stores the amount of water kept in the cauldron, in units of glass bottles that can be filled.

{| class="wikitable"
! [[Bedrock Edition data values|DV]] !! Description
|-
| 0 || Empty
|-
| 1 || ⅓ filled
|-
| 2 || ⅔ filled
|-
| 3 || Fully filled
|}

=== [[Nether Portal]] ===
{| class="wikitable"
! [[Bedrock Edition data values|DV]] !! Orientation
|-
| 0 || Automatic
|-
| 1 || Facing North/South (obsidian to east and west)
|-
| 2 || Facing East/West (obsidian to north and south)
|}

=== [[End Portal Frame]] ===
The bottom two bits determine which "side" of the whole portal frame this block is a part of. To make the frame activate, each of the portal frame blocks in the pattern must "face" toward the middle. Since the image is near-symmetrical, it is difficult to tell which direction an individual block is actually facing, but if the block isn't facing in that direction and that is the last frame block where the Eye of Ender is placed, the frame won't activate.

Direction vectors for the blocks are the following:
* 0: To the south
* 1: To the west
* 2: To the north
* 3: To the east

0x4 is a bit flag: 0 is an "empty" frame block, 1 is a block with an [[Eye of Ender]] inserted.

=== {{Anchor|Cocoa Plants}}[[Cocoa]] ===
{| class="wikitable"
! Bits !! Values
|-
| 0x1<br>0x2 || A two-bit field storing a value from 0 to 4 specifying the direction the pod is attached to:
* 0: Attached to the north
* 1: Attached to the east
* 2: Attached to the south
* 3: Attached to the west
|-
| 0x4<br>0x8 || A two-bit field storing a value from 0 to 3 specifying the stage of growth of the plant:
* 0: First stage
* 1: Second stage
* 2: Final stage 
|}

=== [[Tripwire Hook]] ===
{| class="wikitable"
! Bits !! Values
|-
| 0x1<br>0x2 || A two-bit field storing a value from 0 to 3:
* 0: Tripwire hook on block side facing south
* 1: Tripwire hook on block side facing west
* 2: Tripwire hook on block side facing north
* 3: Tripwire hook on block side facing east
|-
| 0x4 || If set, the tripwire hook is connected and ready to trip ("middle" position).
|-
| 0x8 || If set, the tripwire hook is currently activated ("down" position)
|}

=== [[Tripwire]] ===
{| class="wikitable"
! Bits !! Description
|-
| 0x1 || Set if tripwire is activated (an entity is intersecting its collision mask).
|-
| 0x2 || ''Unused''
|-
