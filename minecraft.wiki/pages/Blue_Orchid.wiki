A '''blue orchid''' is a [[flower]] that generates exclusively in [[swamp]] biomes. It is used to craft [[light blue dye]] and [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A blue orchid can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A blue orchid also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Blue Orchid|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Blue orchids generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[swamp]]s as part of [[vegetation]] features.

Potted blue orchids can also be found in [[woodland mansion]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a swamp biome, blue orchids have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area {{in|java}}, or a 7×5×7 area {{in|bedrock}}.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, when [[bone meal]] is applied to a blue orchid in any biome, more blue orchids appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up blue orchids, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell a blue orchid for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, blue orchids can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Blue orchids can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using a blue orchid imparts the {{EffectLink|Saturation}} effect for 0.35 seconds {{in|java}} or 0.3 seconds {{in|bedrock}}. The Saturation effect restores an additional {{hunger|7}} hunger and 14 saturation {{in|java}}, or {{hunger|6}} hunger and 12 saturation {{in|bedrock}}. The suspicious stew can be crafted using a blue orchid or produced by feeding a blue orchid to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with blue orchids, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Blue orchids can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a blue orchid have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a blue orchid into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of blue orchids yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
