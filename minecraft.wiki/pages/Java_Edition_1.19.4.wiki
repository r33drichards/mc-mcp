'''1.19.4''' is a minor update to {{JE}} released on March 14, 2023,<ref>{{mcnet|minecraft-java-edition-1-19-4|1.19.4|March 14, 2023|Staff}}</ref> which adds the {{cmd|ride}} and {{cmd|damage}} commands, makes technical changes, and fixes bugs.<ref>{{snap|23w03a|January 18, 2023}}</ref>
Aside from the aforementioned changes, this version also released more features for [[Java Edition 1.20|1.20]] under an "Experimental" toggle. This is the first version released in 2023.

== Additions ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]] entities'''
* Including block display, item display, and text display ({{cd|d=and|block_display|item_display|text_display}}), for flexible display of blocks, items and text.
** Like [[marker]] ({{cd|marker}}), don't tick and have no collisions or physics.
** Models render at entity position, with normal rotation around X and Y axis (so it can be controlled by teleport commands), but also with additional arbitrary model transform.
* 2 new data types added, each of them has 2 forms, but only one for saving, as following:
** {{cd|rotation}}
*** Quaternion form (used for saving): array of 4 numbers, describing components (x, y, z, w).
*** Axis-angle form: object with following fields:
**** {{cd|axis}}: 3D vector.
**** {{cd|angle}}: Angle in radians.
** {{cd|transformation}}: Arbitrary affine transform, composed as following fields and following order:
*** Matrix form: array of 16 numbers, describing row-major matrix.
*** Decomposed form (used for saving): object with following fields:
**** {{cd|translation}}: 3D vector.
**** {{cd|left_rotation}}: {{cd|rotation}} object.
**** {{cd|scale}}: 3D vector.
**** {{cd|right_rotation}}: {{cd|rotation}} object.
* Some properties of display entites can be interpolated, to create gradual changes over time for clients, instead of instantenous jumps.
** Display entities keep track of current and previous values of interpolated values:
*** All properties marked as "interpolated" are part of a single interpolation set.
*** Any update to interpolated property causes all values of interpolation set to be saved as "current".
**** Data command executions that do not change value of property (even if it's present in NBT) do not count as updates.
**** Updates are synchronized to clients at most once per tick, so multiple updates within command still count as single update.
*** Previous current values are saved as "previous".
*** If interpolation is enabled, entity transitions between "previous" and "current" values over time.
*** Start of interpolation (entity fully in "previous" state) is defined by field {{cd|interpolation_start}} (game time, in ticks).
**** Set to {{cd|-1}} to load current game time instead.
** When a new interpolation is started, it starts from the current state.
** Interpolation always starts at the beginning on client tick.
** Field {{cd|interpolation_start}} is replaced with {{cd|start_interpolation}}, with a different meaning.
** {{cd|start_interpolation}} describes amount of ticks from the start of next client tick after receiving an update to start of interpolation.
*** For example, value 0 means that interpolation starts at the beginning of next client tick after receiving the update.
** {{cd|start_interpolation}} is not stored in entity data.
*** When using {{cmd|data}} commands, if interpolated value is updated, but {{cd|start_interpolation}} is not present in modified tag, interpolation continues from the time of previous update, but with new values.
** End of interpolation (entity fully in "current" state) is defined as {{cd|interpolation_start}} + {{cd|interpolation_duration}} (in ticks).
* Every entity in family has the following fields:
** {{cd|transformation}}: {{cd|transformation}} applied to model (after normal entity orientation). Defaults to identity. Interpolated.
** {{cd|billboard}}: option to control if entity should pivot to face player when rendered:
*** {{cd|fixed}}: No rotation (default).
*** {{cd|vertical}} Entity can pivot around vertical axis.
*** {{cd|horizontal}} Entity can pivot around horizontal axis.
*** {{cd|center}} Entity can pivot around center point.
** {{cd|brightness}}: If present, overrides light values used for rendering. Omited by default (which means rendering uses values from entity position). Object has two fields:
*** {{cd|sky}}: Value of skylight, from 0 to 15.
*** {{cd|block}}: Value of block light, from 0 to 15.
** {{cd|view_range}}: Maximum view range of this entity. Actual distance depends on client-side render distance and entity distance scalling. Default value 1.0 (roughly the same as fireball).
** {{cd|shadow_radius}}: Size of shadow. Defaults to 0 (no shadow). Interpolated.
** {{cd|shadow_strength}}: Strength of the shadow. Controls the opacity of the shadow as a function of distance to block below. Defaults to 1. Interpolated.
** {{cd|d=,|width|height}}: Describe size of culling bounding box. Bounding box spans vertically {{cd|y}} to {{cd|y+height}} and horizontally {{cd|width/2}} in all directions from entity position. If either field is set to 0, culling is disabled. Both default to 0.
** {{cd|glow_color_override}}: Override glow border color. Defaults to 0 (use team color).
* Besides common fields, these entitiy types also have some exclusive fields for their different usages:
** Item display ({{cd|item_display}}): Displays a single item stack (stack can be changed with commands by setting slot {{cd|inventory.0}}).
*** {{cd|item}}: Item stack to display. Same format as in inventory.
**** Example: {{cd|{id: "minecraft:dirt", Count: 1} }}
*** {{cd|item_display}}: Describes item model transform applied to item (as defined in {{cd|display}} section in model JSON)
**** Values: {{cd|none}} (default), {{cd|d=,|thirdperson_lefthand|thirdperson_righthand|firstperson_lefthand|firstperson_righthand|head|gui|ground|fixed}}.
** Block display ({{cd|block_display}}): Displays a block state, does not display block entities, even if they would normally be created on block placement (like [[chest]]).
*** {{cd|block_state}}: Block state to display. Same format as item held by [[endermen]].
**** Example: {{cd|{Name:"minecraft:dirt"} }}.
** Text display ({{cd|text_display}}): Displays a text component (backgrounds uses new shader types {{cd|d=and|rendertype_text_background|rendertype_text_background_see_through}}).
*** {{cd|text}}: Text to display. Components are resolved with the context of the display entity.
*** {{cd|line_width}}: Line width used to split lines (note: new line can be also addded with {{cd|\n}} characters). Defaults to 200.
*** {{cd|text_opacity}}: Opacity (alpha component) of rendered text. Defaults to 255. Interpolated.
*** {{cd|background}}: Color of background. Includes alpha channel. Defaults to 0x40000000. Interpolated.
*** {{cd|default_background}}: If true, rendering uses default text background color (same as in chat). Defaults to false.
*** {{cd|shadow}}: Should text be displayed with shadow. Defaults to false.
*** {{cd|see_through}}: Should text be visible through blocks. Defaults to false.
*** {{cd|alignment}}: How text should be aligned.
**** Values: {{cd|center}} (default), {{cd|d=,|left|right}}.

'''[[Interaction]]'''
* A new type of entity that records {{ctrl|attack}}s and {{ctrl|interact}}ions. Interactions ({{cd|interact}}ion) are invisible and of a custom size, with following fields:
** {{cd|width}}: Width of the entity's bounding box (default {{cd|1}}).
** {{cd|height}}: Height of the entity's bounding box (default {{cd|1}}).
** {{cd|attack}}: An action object, records the last attack action on the entity.
** {{cd|interaction}}: An action object, records the last interaction action on the entity.
** {{cd|response}}: Boolean specifying if interacting should trigger a response (arm swing, sound effects, etc - default {{cd|false}}).
* Introduced action object accordingly. When an action is stored, it always has two fields:
** {{cd|player}}: The UUID (in standard integer array format) of the player performing the action.
** {{cd|timestamp}}: The timestamp of the game tick when the event happened (stored as a long).
* This made following command usage possible:
** Execute command as the last player who attacked the entity when using {{cmd|execute on attacker}}.
** Execute command as the last player who interacted with the entity when using {{cmd|execute on target}}.
* Advancement triggers also got triggered, when:
** Interacting with an interaction entity: {{cd|player_interacted_with_entity}}.
** Attacking an interaction entity: {{cd|player_hurt_entity}}.

=== Command format ===

** If the relation is not applicable to the executing entity or there are no entities matching it, selector returns zero elements.
* New sub-command: {{cd|summon}}, with the following syntax:
** {{cd|... summon <entity> -> execute}}
** This sub-command is for summoning new entity and binding context ({{cd|@s}}) to it. Meant to simplify entity setup and reduce need for raw NBT editing.
* New sub-command: {{cd|positioned over}}, for finding positions on top of a heightmap. Changes the height of the execution position to be on top of the given heightmap. Syntax:
** {{cd|... positioned over <heightmap> -> execute}}
*** {{cd|<heightmap>}}: A heightmap records the highest position in a column of blocks according to some criteria. Available options:
**** {{cd|world_surface}}: Any non-air block.
**** {{cd|motion_blocking}}: Any motion blocking material (e.g. ignores flowers and grass).
**** {{cd|motion_blocking_no_leaves}}: Any non-leaf motion blocking material.
**** {{cd|ocean_floor}}: Any non-fluid motion blocking material.
* Added a new relation {{cd|origin}} for {{cmd|link=none|execute on}}, which can select:
** Shooter, if the executing entity is a [[projectile]] (like [[arrow]], [[fireball]], [[trident]], [[firework]], thrown [[potion]], etc.)
** Thrower, if the executing entity is an [[item (entity)|item]].
** Source of effects, if the executing entity is an [[area effect cloud]].
** Igniter, if the executing entity is a [[primed TNT]].

* Added registry {{cd|trim_pattern}} and {{cd|trim_material}}, which defines trim patterns and materials respectively, to allow add them via data packs.
** These are synchronized to clients when they join the server, but the accompanying resource pack is required on client to make them visible.
** The paths to these textures are inferred based on the filename of the pattern json, and try to find the textures within the same namespace as the trim pattern's {{cd|name}} field.
* {{cd|trim_pattern}} defines following data:
** {{cd|asset_id}}: a namespaced ID used to infer texture locations and localization.
** {{cd|template_item}}: the ID of the smithing template item used to apply the trim pattern.
** {{cd|description}}: a text component used for displaying the pattern name of an armor trim when hovering an armor item stack.
* {{cd|trim_material}} defines following data:
** {{cd|asset_name}}: a string used as a suffix for armor trim texture locations.
** {{cd|ingredient}}: the ID of the ingredient item used to apply the trim material.
** {{cd|item_model_index}}: a float number which defines the item model override each armor item model should target to change their visuals for this material.
** {{cd|description}}: a text component used for displaying the material name of an armor trim when hovering an armor itemstack.
*** The style defined in this description is applied to the armor trim pattern {{cd|description}} as well.
** {{cd|override_armor_materials}}: an optional map of armor material to overriden color palette.
*** Map key is the armor material that this trim material wants to override with a different color palette.
*** Map value is the name of the color palette that is used when this trim material is applied to an armor piece with the corresponding armor material.

'''[[Recipe]]'''
* Added {{cd|d=and|smithing_transform|smithing_trim}} recipe serializers for the updated netherite upgrade and the new armor trim recipe respectively.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* Added {{cd|paletted_permutations}}, which is a new type of atlas configuration source used to dynamically generate new textures in memory based on a set of color palettes.
** Color palettes allows to swap out the colors of a texture without having to supply all files for the variants of a texture in a resource pack.
** This is useful for things like armor trims. It can change the their color directly without create a new texture for each color.
** The {{cd|paletted_permutations}} source has a set of required parameters:
*** {{cd|textures}}: a list of namespaced locations of base textures.
**** These textures are used to generate variants of them that have been modified by color palettes.
*** {{cd|palette_key}}: a namespaced location of a color palette key file.
**** A color palette key is used to define the set of key pixel colors we want to swap out with the color palettes defined below.
*** {{cd|permutations}}: a map of permutations from suffix to a namespaced location of a color palette file.
**** The suffix is appended at the beginning to the resource location of the output variant textures, with a {{cd|_}} character separating the suffix and the base texture name.
**** The color palette is a texture file with a set of pixels that are used for replacing pixels that match the color palette key in each base texture.
**** The number of pixels in each color palette must be the same as that of the {{cd|palette_key}} defined for this source.
**** Key matching is done by comparing the RGB values of each pixel in the {{cd|palette_key}} to the RGB values of each pixel in the color palette.
**** Alpha channel is ignored for key matching, but in the resulting texture the alpha channel is multiplied with the color palette's alpha channel.
**** Pixels that do not match the {{cd|palette_key}} are copied over to the resulting texture as-is.
** After defining a {{cd|paletted_permutations}} source, those namespaced output textures can be referenced in other resources in resource pack.
*** For example, if the following {{cd|paletted_permutations}} source exists:
**** <syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
    "type": "paletted_permutations",
    "textures": [
        "minecraft:item/leather_helmet",
        "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate",
        "minecraft:item/leather_leggings",
        "minecraft:item/leather_boots"
    ],
    "palette_key": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/leather_armor_color_key",
    "permutations": {
        "red": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/red",
        "green": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/green",
        "blue": "minecraft:colormap/color_palettes/blue"
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>
*** The resulting textures can be referenced in other resources like this:
**** <syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
    "textures": {
        "layer0": "minecraft:item/leather_helmet_red",
        "layer1": "minecraft:item/leather_chestplate_green",
        "layer2": "minecraft:item/leather_boots_blue"
    }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

'''[[Tag]]s'''
