The '''world spawn''' is where [[player]]s initially spawn in the ''Minecraft'' world.

{{see also|Spawn/Multiplayer details|title1=Multiplayer spawning details}}

New players initially spawn within a small area surrounding the world spawn point when the server is ''not'' in Adventure mode. Upon death or return from [[the End]] dimension, the player respawns within this area unless the player's [[#Individual spawn|individual spawn point]] changed (by using a [[bed]], [[respawn anchor]], or {{cmd|spawnpoint}} ).

This area is 21×21 blocks by default {{in|Java|Education}} or 11×11 {{in|Bedrock}}, but can be changed by the {{cd|respawn_radius}}{{only|je}} or {{cd|spawnradius}}{{only|be}} [[game rule]] or world settings.

The respawn radius has the range of 0 to 99,999,999. However, anything above 128 will be reset to 128 when rejoining the world.

When the respawn radius is set to 0, the player spawns in the crosshair where the four blocks meet. When set to 1, the player always spawns on the northwest of those four blocks. Afterwards, normal spawning rules apply.

On the discontinued [[Old]] world type{{only|Bedrock|short=1}}, the maximum spawn radius is 256 blocks instead.

When the player first loads into the world or respawns, the game searches within the world spawn area and tries to place the player on a random [[grass block]]. Upon spawning, the player is placed on the highest valid spawn point block of the X and Z spawn [[coordinates]], regardless of elevation. If a grass block was invalid, due to being obstructed by a block above it, the game checks the closest two free spaces from below the grass block and the player spawns there. However, if there are no valid grass blocks, the player spawns directly at the world spawn point. The player is still placed at the highest valid block at the world spawn point. This can result in players falling into the [[void]] after spawning if there are no blocks at that location.

In Java Edition, the world spawn point is determined by a search algorithm to prevent players from spawning in oceans or rivers. Each location has a "fitness" value, which is higher the closer it is to non-river land and the closer it is to (0,0). The search algorithm first sets the spawn point at a position where both XZ coordinates are 0. It then selects positions on circles with radius of 512, 1024, 1536, and 2048 blocks, calculating their fitness. If a more suitable position is found, the spawn point is set to that position. The algorithm then draws 16 circles centered at the current spawn point, each 32 blocks apart, and selects positions on these circles to calculate their fitness. If a more suitable position is found among these, the world spawn point is set to that position; otherwise, the world spawn point remains at the current position.

The world spawn point can be changed using the {{cmd|setworldspawn}} command.

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' world spawn search ====
{{IN|bedrock}}, when a [[player]] creates a new world, the world spawn point is restricted to specific biomes. The algorithm starts searching from coordinate 0,0, continuing outward until an acceptable biome is found for the world spawn point. Using add-ons, a rare biome can be designated to cause the player to spawn at a distant location, but the game crashes if the biome does not exist or cannot generate.

The algorithm searches for these biomes:
* {{BiomeLink|Plains}}
* {{BiomeLink|Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|Dark Forest}}
* {{BiomeLink|Birch Forest}} 
* {{BiomeLink|Taiga}}
* {{BiomeLink|Jungle}}
* {{BiomeLink|Desert}}
* {{BiomeLink|Savanna}} (only regular variants)
* {{BiomeLink|Badlands}}
* {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
* {{BiomeLink|Cherry Grove}}
* {{BiomeLink|Grove}}

The player spawns within a 5-block radius of the point selected in the chosen biome, sometimes resulting in the player spawning outside the intended spawn biome, ending up in a beach, river, or swamp biome. It is also possible (but rare) for a player to spawn initially underwater and start drowning.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-120237}}</ref>

A search for a valid world spawn biome is ''not'' performed for [[Flat]] and [[Old]] world-types.

==== Adventure mode ====
When the server's settings specify the default game mode as Adventure (using the server.properties), then the normal spawning mechanic is ignored, and players are spawned directly on the world spawn point. This includes the X, Y, and Z coordinates, even if there is no block there, and even if there are blocks above it.

If the Y coordinate is not within a valid spawning area, then the server looks up until it finds one, up to a maximum of Y=256. If there is space to spawn, but it is in mid-air, the player spawns in mid-air, even falling into the void if there is a hole.

==== Location ====
There are several ways to determine the world spawn point:
* A [[compass]] (that hasn't been assigned to a [[lodestone]]) always points to the world spawn point.
* Doing the [[command]]s {{cmd|gamerule spawnRadius 0}} then {{cmd|kill}}.
* If commands are disabled, remove all the [[grass blocks]] in the 21×21 spawn area (or place a block above them to make them invalid), make sure the individual spawn point is disabled, and die.
* Entities, other than players, falling into the [[exit portal]] in [[the End]] land exactly at the world spawn point. Items thrown in mark the spot in the [[Overworld]]. Players spawn like they normally do, allowing this action to be used to perform the above without dying, and thus can be performed in [[hardcore mode]].
* Mods or external programs, such as [[Programs and editors/NBTExplorer|NBTExplorer]] or [[MCEdit]], can also be used to find and set the world spawn point.

=== Individual spawn ===
The individual spawn point of the player can be changed by sleeping in a [[bed]], using a [[respawn anchor]], or using the {{cmd|spawnpoint}} command. If the individual spawning area of the player is obstructed upon death, the player respawns at the world spawn.

Sleeping in a bed allows for leniency in obstruction, in that the player respawns on other blocks near the bed if the original point becomes blocked. The same is true for the respawn anchor. If the spawn point set via {{cmd|setworldspawn}} or {{cmd|spawnpoint}} becomes obstructed, the player is not given this leniency in respawning. If the block obstructing the player's spawn point is a bed in the Overworld or a respawn anchor in the Nether, regardless of if the bed or respawn anchor was used to set the spawnpoint, this leniency will still be given.

For the spawn point to be considered unobstructed, certain criteria need to be met. Generally, for a spawn point set via {{cmd|/setworldspawn}} or {{cmd|/spawnpoint}}, there must be a two-block-tall space at the spawn point which is free of [[solid blocks]]. However, there are also some solid blocks which do not obstruct spawning, some examples including the [[Heavy Core|heavy core]], [[candles]], and [[Head|player and mob heads]]. [[Lava]] and [[water]] will also obstruct the spawn point despite being non-solid, however, aquatic plants, such as [[kelp]] and [[seagrass]], will not, even when in water. The player will always be spawned in the center of the spawn point block and {{frac|1|10}} of a block above the bottom of the block, even if there is a non-obstructing solid block occupying the space, such that the player can sometimes be spawned inside of a block they would otherwise have collision with. Unlike when respawning around a bed or respawn anchor, the block below the spawn point is not considered, meaning the player can be spawned on top of dangerous blocks such as [[Magma Block|magma block]]s, or over a non-solid block. The state of any blocks occupying the two-block-tall spawning space is also not considered. For example, an open [[Fence Gate|fence gate]] will still obstruct the spawn point even though the player has no collision with it.

== Trivia ==
* Developer [[Ulraf]] in a livestream expressed the idea of giving the [[dragon egg]] the use of modifying the world spawn, because there is only one dragon egg per world. He clarified that he experimented with this idea using [[command]]s, and that there weren't plans to add this function to vanilla.<ref> https://youtu.be/2cxUNoWNy50?t=11284</ref>
