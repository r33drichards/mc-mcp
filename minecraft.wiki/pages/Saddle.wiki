A '''saddle''' is [[equipment]] for certain [[animal]]s that either enables or improves the act of {{Control|riding}} them. All saddled animals can be directly controlled, except for [[pig]]s and [[strider]]s, which must be guided using [[Carrot on a Stick|carrots]] or [[warped fungi on sticks]].

=== Mob loot ===
Any mob equipped with a saddle drops the saddle upon death.

A [[strider]] may spawn being ridden by a [[zombified piglin]] as a [[strider jockey]], which causes it to spawn wearing a saddle. This saddle always drops when the strider is killed.

A [[ravager]] has a large version of a saddle on its texture, but does not actually wear one, neither does it have the "Saddle" [[NBT format|NBT]] tag, but it always drops a saddle upon death. Looting does not affect the drop.

== Usage ==
[[File:SaddledHorse.png|thumb|right|A [[horse]] equipped with a saddle.]]

=== Equipping ===
While [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[skeleton horse]]s{{Only|Java}}, [[zombie horse]]s, [[camel]]s and [[camel husk]]s can always be ridden, a saddle is required to control them. These mobs (only after being [[Taming|tamed]], in the case of equine mobs) can be equipped with a saddle by placing it in their [[inventory]], which can be accessed by opening the {{control|inventory}} while riding the mob or pressing {{control|use}} on the mob while {{control|sneaking}}. It can also be equipped directly by {{control|using}} the saddle on the mob.

Tamed [[nautilus]]es and [[zombie nautilus]]es can always be ridden, but a saddle is required to control them. Like equines and camels, they can be equipped with a saddle by placing it in their [[inventory]] or using the saddle on the them.

Saddles are required in order to ride [[pig]]s and [[strider]]s, but even with a saddle their movement cannot be controlled. A [[carrot on a stick]] (for pigs) or a [[warped fungus on a stick]] (for striders) is required to direct these mobs. As these mobs lack an inventory, the only method for equipping a saddle is {{control|using}} the saddle on them. 

[[Animal]]s can also be equipped with saddles by a [[dispenser]].

=== Removing ===
For equines, camels and nautiluses, the saddle can be unequipped by removing it from the {{SlotSprite|Saddle}} saddle [[slot]] or by {{control|using}} [[shears]] on the mob.

For pigs and striders, the saddle can only be unequipped by using shears. This is the only way to safely remove a saddle from these mobs.

=== Properties ===
While a player is riding a saddled mob, a view of the mob's health bar replaces the hunger bar on the [[HUD]].

Saddles cannot be [[enchanting|enchanted]] in Survival mode. However, in ''[[Java Edition]]'' Creative mode, an [[anvil]] can be used to enchant the saddle with [[Thorns]], [[Curse of Binding]], and [[Curse of Vanishing]]. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.

A saddle maintains properties such as a custom name and enchantments when dropped by the mob that was wearing it.

Once equipped, any mob with a saddle does not despawn and remains in the world.
