The event was conceived by [[Markus Persson|Notch]] after he expressed interest in a meet-up in a blog post<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118182136/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1008498266/how-about-a-somewhat-spontaneous-minecraftcon-2010|title=How about a somewhat spontaneous MinecraftCon 2010?|website=Notch's Tumblr|date=August 2010}}</ref> and called on the community to organize it without specifying a venue.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/discussion/115057-minecraftcon-2010-in-bellevue|title=MinecraftCon 2010 in Bellevue|website=Minecraft Forum|date=August 2010}}</ref> Notch was already in the area visiting the offices of Valve Software.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905215121/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1058999436/a-brief-summary-of-bellevue-more-to-come-next-week|title=A brief summary of Bellevue|website=Notch's Tumblr|date=September 2010}}</ref> Although Notch referred to it as "MinecraftCon 2010," the event was more of an informal gathering than a traditional gaming or anime convention.

A thread on the [[Minecraft Forum]]<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/25879-|title=MinecraftCon 2010 Discussion|website=Minecraft Forum|date=August 2010}}</ref> served as an unofficial hub for organizing the event, with attendees sharing YouTube videos and photos afterward.<ref>{{Reddit|d58pz|title=MinecraftCon 2010, Bellevue, August 31st|author=deleted|date=August 25, 2010}}</ref>

Over 50 people attended the gathering, including one fan in a full-body [[creeper]] costume,<ref>[[:File:Creeper costume at MINECON 2010.jpg]]</ref> which caught Notch's attention.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20100904042025/http://picasaweb.google.com/Ubercow1337/MinecraftCon2010#</ref> Notch discussed his future plans for ''Minecraft''<ref>{{Reddit|d846p|title=Confirmed additions from minecraftcon 2010|author=Ballsmasher|date=September 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/818408-minecraftcon-2010-which-one-for-friday-less-than-9|title=MinecraftCon 2010 Discussion|website=Minecraft Forum|date=September 2010}}</ref> and addressed the recent popularity of [[Herobrine]].<ref>{{Ytl|7vjhooRq3Ek|MinecraftCon 2010|Miles Smith|September 1, 2010}}</ref> Several attendees livestreamed the event or uploaded recorded footage to YouTube.
