A '''skeleton skull''' is the [[head]] of a [[skeleton]] in the form of a [[block]]. It can be obtained from [[ancient cities]] or by killing a skeleton using a [[charged creeper]]'s [[explosion]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of skeleton skull.<ref>{{bug|MC-192905||Heads & Skulls have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Skeleton Skull}}
Skeleton skull drops itself when it's destroyed.
When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the skeleton skull always drops as an item.

=== Natural generation ===
Skeleton skulls can generate in [[ancient cities]], which sometimes generate in the [[deep dark]].

=== Mob loot ===
Skeleton heads are always dropped by a [[skeleton]] if it dies due to a [[charged creeper]]'s explosion. {{IN|bedrock}}, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however {{in|java}} only one mob selected at random drops its head.<ref>{{bug|MC-63534|||WAI}}</ref>

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
A skeleton skull can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to [[sign]]s. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking.

=== Wearing ===
{{See also|#Renders}}

The player can wear skeleton skulls, similarly to [[pumpkin]]s or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's [[skin]].

==== Disguise ====
Wearing a skeleton skull reduces the detection range for [[skeleton]]s. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from [[sneaking]] and from the [[Invisibility]] status effect.

{{IN|bedrock}}, wearing a skeleton skull makes the player invisible to other players on a locator [[map]].

=== Dispensers ===
A [[dispenser]] can equip a skeleton skull on a player, mob, or [[armor stand]] with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing.

=== Enchantments ===
Skeleton skulls can receive the following enchantments, but only through an [[anvil]].

=== Note blocks ===
Placing a skeleton skull above a [[note block]] causes the note block to play the [[skeleton]]'s {{cd|ambient}} sound when activated.

The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Skeleton skull is destroyed when the [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by the [[sticky piston]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Skeleton skulls do not have their own textures and take their textures from other objects.
* When [[breaking]] a skeleton skull, the particle effect of breaking it is the same as [[soul sand]].
* {{IN|be}}, the skull variant for the item is stored under the {{cd|damage}} component, normally used for items with [[durability]].
