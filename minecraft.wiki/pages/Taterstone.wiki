'''Taterstone''' is a common [[block]] found in the Potato dimension. It is dropped when mining [[potone]] in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The best tool to break taterstone is the [[hoe]], resulting in one taterstone being dropped. If not broken with a hoe, the block drops nothing.

=== Potone ===
[[Potone]] drops taterstone if broken with a non-[[Silk Touch]] hoe.
