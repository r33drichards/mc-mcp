'''20w21a''' is the eighteenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on May 20, 2020,<ref name="20w21a">{{snap|20w21a|May 20, 2020}}</ref> which adds experimental support for [[custom|custom worlds]] and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
[[File:Warped Forest Overworld.png|333px|thumb|A warped forest biome in the Overworld using the new generator.]]

=== General ===
'''[[Customized]] worlds'''
* Added experimental support for new custom worlds.
* The "Edit World" menu now has an option to export world settings to a JSON file.
** Previously exported world settings can be imported during world creation.
* Many new parameters are exposed but marked as experimental, meaning they can be used but may later be removed.

'''<samp>[[client.json]]</samp> arguments'''
* <code>disableChat</code>
** Disables the receiving and sending of online chat.
* <code>disableMultiplayer</code>
** Disables the "[[Multiplayer]]" and "[[Minecraft Realms]]" buttons.

'''[[Settings]]'''
* Added functionality to import/export world settings.

'''[[Sound events]]'''
* Added a new sound event for [[fox]]es teleporting after eating a [[chorus fruit]].

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Added an unused<ref>{{bug|MC-184622}}</ref> subtitle for traveling through a [[nether portal]], "Portal noise fades".
* Added a subtitle for activating a nether portal, "Portal noise intensifies".
* Added a subtitle for [[cat]] purring, "Cat purrs".
* Added a subtitle for [[donkey]] eating, "Donkey eats".
* Added a subtitle for fox teleporting, "Fox teleports".
* Added subtitles for [[mule]]s neighing and eating; "Mule neighs" and "Mule eats", respectively.
* Added subtitles for [[parrot]]s imitating [[hoglin]]s, [[piglin]]s, and [[zoglin]]s; "Parrot growls", "Parrot snorts", and "Parrot growls", respectively.
* Added subtitles for [[zombie]]s attacking and breaking wooden [[door]]s; "Door shakes" and "Door breaks", respectively.
* Added subtitles for using [[cartography table]]s, [[loom]]s, and [[stonecutter]]s; "Map drawn", "Loom used", and "Stonecutter used", respectively.
* Several of these subtitles do not show up in-game but are specified in <samp>[[sounds.json]]</samp>.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Redstone dust]]'''
* Right-clicking an isolated redstone toggles it between a cross and a dot.
** A dot of redstone does not power surrounding blocks, and a cross does.
** Redstone which is connected to anything is not toggleable.

'''[[Log|Stems]]'''
* Now have a hardness of 1.

=== Items ===
'''[[Nether sprouts]]'''
* Are now positioned in the center of the inventory slot as opposed to the bottom.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Piglin]]s'''
* No longer walk around when admiring golden items.
* If a piglin is hurt while admiring a gold ingot, the ingot now disappears without completing a barter.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Ore (feature)|Ore blobs]]'''
* Increased the chance of ores to generate in the [[basalt deltas]] to balance against the reduced amount of [[netherrack]] in this biome.

'''World types'''
* [[Buffet]] worlds can no longer be created from <samp>[[server.properties]]</samp>.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Structure names are now specified as lowercase.

'''{{cmd|spreadplayers}}'''
* Added the ability to control the height.
** Syntax: {{cmd|spreadplayers <center> <spreadDistance> <maxRange> under <maxHeight> <respectTeams> <targets>}}
*** <code>maxHeight</code> specifies the maximum height for resulting positions.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Fishing]]'''
* [[Lily pad]]s are now considered junk fishing loot rather than treasure.

=== General ===
[[File:Splash2020.png|thumb|New Mojang logo on the loading screen.]]
[[File:Java Edition logo 12.png|thumb|New Minecraft logo.]]

'''[[Title Screen|Menu screens]] and splash'''
* Updated [[Mojang Studios]] and Minecraft [[logo]]s.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
* The <code>Dimension</code> tag is now a resource location string instead of a number, which is used in [[player.dat]].

'''[[Obsidian platform]]'''
* Now can regenerate when a non-player entity enters the End through an [[end portal]].

'''[[Subtitles]]'''
* Changed the subtitle for [[zombie villager]]s converting from "Zombie vociferates" to "Zombie Villager vociferates".
* Changed the subtitle for zombie villagers being cured from "Zombie snuffles" to "Zombie Villager snuffles".
* Changed the capitalization:
** "Blast furnace crackles" to "Blast Furnace crackles".
** "Enchanting table used" to "Enchanting Table used".
** "Respawn anchor is charged" to "Respawn Anchor is charged".
** "Respawn anchor depletes" to "Respawn Anchor depletes".
** "Respawn anchor sets spawn" to "Respawn Anchor sets spawn".
** "Turtle egg breaks" to "Turtle Egg breaks".
** "Turtle egg cracks" to "Turtle Egg cracks".
** "Turtle egg hatches" to "Turtle Egg hatches".
* Removed the subtitle "Horse lands".

'''[[Superflat]]'''
* Removed structure settings from flat level preset strings as it was broken due to the addition of customizable worlds.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Removed wither roses from the <code>#prevent_mob_spawning_inside</code> block tag.

'''[[World]]s'''
* Old customized worlds (from before [[Java Edition 1.13]]) now say "Old Customized" in the world selection screen.
