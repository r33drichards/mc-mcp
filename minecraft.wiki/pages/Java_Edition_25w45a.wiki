'''25w45a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.11]], released on November 4, 2025, which adds a coral variant of [[zombie nautilus]] and a [[netherite]] tier of [[horse armor]].<ref>{{snap|25w45a|id=a|November 4, 2025}}</ref>

A separate [[unobfuscated version]] of 25w45a was released, titled '''25w45a Unobfuscated''' (or '''25w45a_unobfuscated''' when in the launcher). This is experimental and is aimed to aid the migration towards clients and servers being unobfuscated, which will be the only form clients and servers will have after the release of 1.21.11.<ref>{{Mcnet|removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition|Removing obfuscation in Java Edition|October 29, 2025}}</ref>

**  Added {{cd|#in_nether}}
*** Contains timelines that are active in the [[Nether]].
**  Added {{cd|#in_end}}
*** Contains timelines that are active in the [[End]].

'''[[Timeline]]s'''
* Are a new experimental concept defined in data packs under the timeline registry (i.e. found under <samp>data/<''namespace''>/timeline/<''id''>.json</samp>).
* Specify game behavior based on the absolute day time (that which is set by {{cmd|time set}}). Timelines optionally can specify a period over which they will be repeated.
* Are able to modify game behavior or visuals by acting as an Environment Attribute source to apply Environment Attribute modifiers.
** Format: object with fields
*** {{cd|period_ticks}}: optional integer, defines the duration in ticks over which the timeline will repeat.
**** If not specified, the timeline will not repeat
*** {{cd|tracks}}: optional map between Environment Attribute IDs and a corresponding Environment Attribute Track object.
* Timelines by default have no effect unless they are included by a dimension.
* With the inclusion of Timelines, Environment Attribute sources are processed in the following order (from low to high priority):
** Dimensions
** Biomes
** Timelines
** Weather (not data-driven)
* Interpolation
** Timelines can define Attribute Tracks 
*** These specify how a modifier for a particular Environment Attribute changes over time by defining keyframes. 
*** Depending on the attribute, interpolation may be used between each keyframe. If interpolation is not used, the previous keyframe value will always be selected.
** For example, a Timeline with a period of 24000 might be set up as following:
*** At time = {{cd|0}}, the timeline provides {{cd|sky_color {{=}} #ff0000}} (red)
*** At time = {{cd|1000}}, the timeline provides {{cd|sky_color {{=}} #ff0000}} (red)
*** At time = {{cd|6000}}, the timeline provides {{cd|sky_color {{=}} #ff00ff}} (magenta)
** Between time = {{cd|0}} and time = {{cd|1000}}, the sky color will be red. Between {{cd|1000}} and {{cd|6000}}, it will shift from red to magenta. Then, from {{cd|6000}} all the way until the timeline repeats and reaches time = {{cd|0}} again, the color will slowly shift back to red.
** Unlike biomes, if a Timeline uses a modifier instead of an override, interpolation is applied to the modifier arguments rather than the final modified values.
* Attribute Tracks
** An Attribute Track specified within a Timeline takes the format of an object with the following fields:
*** {{cd|ease}} &ndash; optional Easing Type (see below), used to ease the interpolaton of the value between keyframes.
**** Default: linear
***** If the target attribute does not support interpolation, the easing mode will have no effect.
*** {{cd|keyframes}} &ndash; list of keyframe objects, must be ordered by the ticks field:
**** {{cd|ticks}} &ndash; integer between 0 and period_ticks (if specified), defines the tick (within the period) at which this keyframe's value will be active.
**** {{cd|value}} &ndash; the modifier argument (format dependent on the chosen modifier).
***** If no modifier is specified (or override is used), the type of this field is the same as the Environment Attribute itself.
***** How this value is used depends on the type of modifier.
****** Note: at most two keyframes can be placed on the same tick, creating an immediate transition.
*** {{cd|modifier}} &ndash; optional string modifier ID, dependent on the Attribute Type (see the Common Modifiers section below).
**** Default: override
** For example, the following Timeline has a period of {{cd|24000}}, and has an attribute track that modifies only {{cd|minecraft:gameplay/cat_waking_up_gift_chance}}. Because the easing is constant, between tick {{cd|362}} and {{cd|23667}} the value is {{cd|0.0}}, while between tick {{cd|23667}} and {{cd|362}} it is {{cd|0.7}}.
** Like other Environment Attribute sources, the specified value is used as the argument to the specified {{cd|modifier}}. This is then applied on top of sources with a lower priority. In this case the modifier is {{cd|maximum}}, so this timeline will only ever increase the value of {{cd|cat_waking_up_gift_chance}} to the value specified in the track.
