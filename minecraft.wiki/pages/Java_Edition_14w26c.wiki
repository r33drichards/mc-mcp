'''14w26c''' is the thirty-first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on June 26, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624075744/https://mojang.com/2014/06/minecraft-snapshot-14w26a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w26c|date=June 25, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> to fix some critical bugs and a major world-save corrupting problem in the [[14w26a]] and [[14w26b]] snapshots.

It is strongly advised ''not'' to use a world that had been last saved with 14w26a or 14w26b; to avoid problems it is advised to use a world backup that was saved with a pre-14w26a version.

A potential means of recovering corrupted worlds using [[Programs and editors/Mapping#Map Editors|MCEdit]] was made available by a Reddit user.<ref>http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/29551r/if_you_corrupted_a_large_project_or_lost_a_large/</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Hay bale]]'''
* Rebalanced how they heal and accelerate the growth of [[horse]]s.

'''[[Jack o'lantern]]s'''

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now have a head slot where armor or blocks can be put, using the {{cmd|replaceitem}} command.
