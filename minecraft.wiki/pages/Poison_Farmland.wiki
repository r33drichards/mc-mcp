'''Poison farmland''' is a joke [[block]] found throughout the [[Potato dimension]] in [[24w14potato]]. It mostly acts as normal [[farmland]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
When mined (even with a [[Silk Touch]] tool), poison farmland drops [[terre de pomme]]. It can be obtained as an item only by using [[commands]], via the [[Creative inventory]] or the {{control|pick block}} control in Creative mode.

=== Natural generation ===
Poison farmland occurs naturally in the [[Potato dimension]]: it covers a large portion of the [[fields]] biome (where only [[potato]]es are growing on it), as well as generating in [[potato village]]s (where potatoes, wheat seeds and carrots can be found growing on it).

=== Post-generation ===
A player can create a block of poison farmland by {{Control|using}} a [[hoe]] on [[terre de pomme]], [[peelgrass block]], [[corrupted peelgrass block]] or [[poison path]].

== Usage ==
Plants can grow on poison farmland.
