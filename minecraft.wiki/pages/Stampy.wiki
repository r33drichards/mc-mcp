=== ''Minecraft Story Mode'' ===
==== Season 1 ====
{{Main|MCSM:Stampy Cat}}
Within the game, he portrays himself in the episode ''{{MCSM|A Portal to Mystery}}'', alongside several other popular creators. His character becomes intertwined with a series of murders connected to the villain the {{MCSM|White Pumpkin}}, where his role in the story can change depending on the player's choices.

==== Season 2 ====
He reappears as himself alongside some builds from his Lovely World series. Being featured in the title screen and in-game, his tower-like structure with a rainbow-striped dome is used as his domestic household in-universe with his Love Garden beside it.

== Trivia ==
* In contrast to other ''Minecraft'' content creators, Stampy doesn't use a custom ''Minecraft'' skin. Instead he uses a skin based on Fidget from ''{{Wikipedia|Dust: An Elysian Tail}}'' which was originally part of the [[Summer of Arcade Skin Pack]] and later re-released in [[Skin Pack 4]], as well as the [[Legacy Skin Pack]].
* Although unofficial to ''[[Minecraft (franchise)|Minecraft]]'', he has partnered with [[4J Studios]] to release the world from his long-time YouTube series ''Stampy's Lovely World'' on the [[Marketplace]].<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/4j-studios/stampy%E2%80%99s-lovely-world/2cac624e-2f90-4b3c-aa62-6dd0493ad20e</ref>
