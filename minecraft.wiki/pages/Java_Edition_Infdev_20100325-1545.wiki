== Bugs ==
'''4 bugs reported'''
* Cave generation sometimes drops performance.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(11:53:21) <sorretil> infdev will get worse"..."(11:53:46) <sorretil> i went from about 158fps to about... 0"..."(12:24:28) <Evil-Ville> the cave generation makes the fps really jittery too so i think i'll wait for the next version"</ref>
* The game crashes on sunset.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(12:22:24) <Evil-Ville> cool the game just crashed when sun started setting"</ref>
** This is caused by flower drops in darkness<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(12:22:40) <Demki> evil, it is because of the deplanting flowers"..."(12:23:00) <Demki> at night all flowers deplant"</ref>
* The game progressively degrades in performance, becoming unbearably slow within minutes of loading a world.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(10:44:43) <Notch> keep in mind that level genration is slow in this version"</ref> (This is caused by flowers that are generated in places where they break as soon as they appear, resulting in an increase in the number of entities. In rare cases, a flower or chunk breaks in such a way to spawn insane amounts of entities, bringing the game to a grinding halt in seconds.)<ref>{{ytl|I9KhSkDHgKQ|MC Java Infdev 2010-03-25 - Game becomes unplayable due to flowers popping out as entities|Le Sharkoïste|May 30, 2022}}</ref>
** This can cause extreme lag spikes happening to the game, and this will sometimes result in the game freezing.
* Above-ground cave entrances cut into trees and [[brick pyramid]]s, resulting in half-destroyed trees and brick pyramids containing caves. The entrances also do not turn dirt into grass, which results in patches of dirt strewn across the terrain near cave entrances.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(12:01:55) <Marach> yay spotted a bug :D"..."(12:03:57) <Marach> Notch: it generated like that. http://imgur.com/zWK2H.png{{Dead link|Image not properly archived}}"..."(12:04:20) <Notch> oh yeah, I should plant trees AFTER carving ;D"..."(12:04:22) <Notch> also, grass"</ref>
