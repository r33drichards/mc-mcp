{{For|the pre-1.15 atlas file containing every texture in the game|textures-atlas}}

A '''texture atlas''', also known as a '''spritesheet''', is an arrangement of game sprites on a single image file, used by the game to store and access associated sprites more efficiently than with individual files.

''Minecraft'' uses both procedurally-generated and predefined texture atlases for different purposes, however all but a small handful of predefined atlases have since been split into individual files for compilation into larger atlases.

These two classes of atlases are documented on separate pages:
* [[/Predefined]]
* [[/Generated]]
