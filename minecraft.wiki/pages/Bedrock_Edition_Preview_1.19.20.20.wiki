'''Vibration'''

'''General'''

'''Bucket Item'''
* Releasing a bucketed custom mob now spawns the correct type of mob
* Fixed the order in which a bucketed mob is created when released, which means any Actor Properties on it will load correctly

'''Dedicated Server'''
* Added a server property disable-player-interaction which informs clients that they should ignore other players when interacting with the world
* Added a new dedicated server property, "chat-restriction", that can be modified in the "server.properties" file to restrict the chat for all players connecting to the server. The property's possible values are "None", "Dropped", and "Disabled". See the default file for more information

*** script-watchdog-enable- Enables the watchdog (default = true)
*** script-watchdog-hang-threshold- Sets the watchdog threshold for single tick hangs (default = 3000 ms)
