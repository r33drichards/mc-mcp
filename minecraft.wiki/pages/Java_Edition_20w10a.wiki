'''20w10a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.16]], released on March 4, 2020,<ref name="20w10a">{{snap|20w10a|March 4, 2020}}</ref> which gives [[smithing table]]s a functionality and adds [[hyphae]] and nether [[Ambience|ambient sounds]].

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Crimson Hyphae (UD) JE1.gif; Warped Hyphae (UD) JE1.gif|32px}} [[Hyphae]]'''
* A variant of stems with the bark on all 6 sides.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Crimson roots]]'''

'''[[Crying obsidian]]'''
* Programmer Art texture is now the old 2011 texture.

'''[[Fire]] and [[soul fire]]'''
* Now has a proper hitbox ({{frac|1|16}} [[block]]s).
* Now has a breaking animation.
* Cannot be put out by [[sword]]s or [[trident]]s in [[Creative]] mode, akin to other blocks, and can be modified via the [[debug stick]].

'''[[Nether sprouts]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Nether Sprouts JE1 BE1.png|32px]] to [[File:Nether Sprouts JE2 BE2.png|32px]] (a little taller than in previous snapshots).

'''[[Observer]]s, [[redstone block]]s, [[target]]s'''
* Now allow placing of [[ladder]]s and [[tripwire hook]]s.

'''[[Smithing table]]s'''
* Added functionality: it is used to upgrade diamond items into netherite versions.

'''[[Warped fungus]]'''

'''Netherite armor, tools and swords'''
* Can no longer be crafted.
* Changed the texture.

'''[[Netherite scrap]]'''
* Changed the texture.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Fish]]'''
* Now despawn when they are further than 64 blocks away from the closest [[player]].
** Does not apply to fish placed by the player or nametagged fish.<ref>{{reddit|fdfmcy/hot_off_the_smithing_table_snapshot_20w10a_is_out|fjh8a2t|title=It was 128 blocks before. This doesn't apply to anything marked persistent, like nametagged fish or fish caught in a bucket and then released again.|author=sliced_lime|date=March 4, 2020}}</ref>

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Item frame]]s'''
* Have two new tags:
** <code>Invisible</code> – makes item frame invisible ([[item]] inside frame remains visible).
** <code>Fixed</code> – prevents item frame from being [[breaking|broken]] and the item inside from being removed (it does not prevent item rotation).

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Bartering]]'''
* Has been tweaked again.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1235259261229436940|It seems we missed a change in the Snapshot changelog: Bartering loot has been tweaked once again: - Soul Sand is back! - Netherite Hoe much less common. - Shroomlight removed. - Warped Fungus removed. - Iron Nuggets added.|March 4, 2020}}</ref>
** [[Piglin]]s can now offer [[soul sand]] and [[iron nugget]]s.
** Piglins no longer offer [[shroomlight]]s, [[warped nylium]], nor [[warped fungi]].
** [[Netherite hoe]]s are now less common.

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The <code>target_hit</code> trigger has been changed.
** Conditions:
*** <code>signalStrength</code> has been renamed to <code>signal_strength</code>.
*** Added <code>projectile</code>: matches the projectile [[entity]].
*** Added <code>shooter</code>: matches the [[player]] who shot or threw the projectile.

'''<samp>[[client.jar]]</samp>'''
* Removed [[Realms]] code from the client, though its assets remain.

'''[[Entity]] UUIDs'''
* UUIDs of the owners of projectiles, such as [[arrow]]s or [[snowball]]s, are now stored as an array of four integers. All UUIDs will be stored in this format in the future.

'''[[Model]]s'''
* All "block states" files have improved spacing, and now define the namespace when referring to the model.{{verify|This does not seem to be true. At least in 21w41a, the item frame blockstates file still seems to not use namespacing. Whether this was always the case and was not changed in 20w10a, or was changed and reverted since, is unknown.}}
* All model files now define the namespace when referring to a different model.{{verify|Also does not seem to be true. Again, in 21w41a, plenty are still using bare referencing like "block/block".}}

'''[[Realms]]'''
* Removed translation strings of:
** <code>mco.create.world.seed</code>.
** <code>mco.trial.title</code>.
** <code>mco.trial.unavailable</code>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added [[crimson hyphae]] and stripped crimson hyphae to the <code>crimson_stems</code> block and item tags.
* Added [[warped hyphae]] and stripped warped hyphae to the <code>warped_stems</code> block and item tags.
