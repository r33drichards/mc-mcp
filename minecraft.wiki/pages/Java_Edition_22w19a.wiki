'''22w19a''' is the tenth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19]], released on May 12, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w19a|May 12, 2022}}</ref> which introduces chat preview, merges {{cmd|locate}} and {{cmd|locatebiome}} into the new {{cmd|locate|link=none}}, adds the ability to locate a POI (Point of Interest), the ability to place a template, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Added {{cmd|locate poi|link=none}}, can locate a POI (Point of Interest), with following syntax:
** {{cmd|locate poi <poi>|link=none}}
*** <code>poi</code>: The namespaced ID of a POI, or a POI tag.

'''{{cmd|place}}'''
* Added {{cmd|place template|link=none}}, can place templates at a given location, with following syntax:
** {{cmd|place template <template> [<pos>] [<rotation>] [<mirror>] [<integrity>] [<seed>]|link=none}}
*** Works like using the load button in the UI for a [[structure block]].
*** <code>template</code>: The namespaced ID of a template ("structure block file") to load and place.
*** <code>pos</code>: The position to use as the origin for the generation. (if omitted, <code>~ ~ ~</code> is used)
*** <code>rotation</code>: The rotation to apply. (if omitted, <code>none</code> is used)
*** <code>mirror</code>: The mirroring to apply. (if omitted, <code>none</code> is used)
*** <code>integrity</code>: The structure integrity value between 0 and 1.
*** <code>seed</code>: The seed to use for the randomized degradation when integrity is less than 1.

=== General ===
'''[[Chat]]'''
* Servers can now enable chat preview, which displays a server-controlled preview above the chat edit box, showing how the message appears when sent.
** Can be used by servers to preview messages with styling applied, such as emojis or chat coloring.
** Chat preview sends chat messages to the server as they are typed, even before they're sent.
*** The server then sends back the styled preview in real time.
*** This allows servers to apply dynamic message stylings while still allowing chat to be securely signed.
** A warning toast message is shown on the client when joining a server with chat preview, and it can be globally disabled in chat settings.
** Dynamic chat styling can also be controlled by the server, although this is only signed when chat preview is enabled.
*** Clients can prefer to always show the original, signed message by enabling "Only Show Signed Chat" in chat settings.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Chat Preview" chat option, for enabling chat preview. Toggled on by default.
* Added "Only Show Signed Chat" chat option, for clients who prefers to always show the original, signed message. Toggled off by default.

'''{{samp|[[options.txt]]}}'''
* Added <code>chatPreview</code> and <code>onlyShowSignedChat</code>.

'''Protocol'''
* Servers now also send an additional icon and MOTD packet after a player has connected.
** This allows servers with <code>enable-status=false</code> to set an icon and MOTD for players that successfully connect.

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Added server property <code>previews-chat</code> to enable chat preview.
** Defaults to <code>false</code>.
* Added temporary server property <code>test-rainbow-chat</code>, for this snapshot only.

'''[[Tags]]'''
* Added following <code>point_of_interest_type</code> tags (new type):
** <code>#acquirable_job_site</code>: {{cd|d=and|armorer|butcher|cartographer|cleric|farmer|fisherman|fletcher|leatherworker|librarian|mason|shepherd|toolsmith|weaponsmith}}.
*** This tag defines job sites sought by [[villager]]s with <code>none</code> profession.
** <code>#bee_home</code>: <code>beehive</code> and <code>bee_nest</code>.
*** This tag defines POIs that [[bee]]s target.
** <code>#village</code>: {{cd|d=and|#acquirable_job_site|home|meeting}}.
*** This tag defines POIs that belongs to [[village]]s.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Iron golem]]'''
* Now make sure to spawn above something solid, so they can now spawn on top of [[glass]] and [[leaves]] and are no longer blocked by things like [[string]].

'''[[Tadpole]]'''
* Hitbox is now reduced from 0.5×0.4 to 0.4×0.3.

'''[[Warden]]'''
* Now make sure to spawn above something solid, so they can now spawn on top of [[glass]] and [[leaves]] and are no longer blocked by things like [[string]].
* Ranged attack damage is now affected by difficulty.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* No longer intersect with [[ancient cities]].

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}} and {{cmd|locatebiome}}'''
* Merged into the new {{cmd|locate|link=none}} command:
** {{cmd|locate|link=none}} -> {{cmd|locate structure|link=none}}
** {{cmd|locatebiome|link=none}} -> {{cmd|locate biome|link=none}}

=== General ===
'''Point of Interest types'''
* Removed <code>unemployed</code> and <code>nitwit</code> types.

== Trivia ==
* This snapshot was released on a Thursday instead of Wednesday, just like snapshots before [[14w26a]]. This was due to an unrelated delay due to a workshop about development that week's Wednesday.<ref>{{tweet|CagilMartin1|1536257811688361984|Just a workshop about development, not a big deal - JAPPA}}</ref>
