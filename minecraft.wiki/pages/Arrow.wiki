An '''arrow''' serves as ammunition for [[bow]]s, [[crossbow]]s, and [[dispenser]]s. Arrows can be crafted into [[spectral arrow]]s and [[tipped arrow]]s to give [[status effects]] to [[player]]s and [[mob]]s.

=== Picking up arrows ===
Arrows shot by players can always be [[#Retrieving|picked up]] in Creative mode.

An arrow ''cannot'' be picked up by a player in [[Survival]] or [[Adventure]] mode if: 
*It is shot by a player in [[Creative]] mode.
*It is shot by any [[mob]] able to shoot arrows, such as [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[pillager]]s, or [[piglin]]s. This includes mobs that do not shoot arrows in normal gameplay, such as [[illusioner]]s and bow-wielding [[wither skeleton]]s.
**This is the case even in Creative mode.<ref>{{bug|MC-128845|||WAI}}</ref>
*It is shot with an [[Infinity]]-enchanted [[bow]].
*It is one of the two extra arrows shot with a [[Multishot]]-enchanted [[crossbow]].

Arrows that are stuck in a player cannot be retrieved, and the player does not drop them when killed.

After a [[tipped arrow]] has been in the ground for {{convert|600|gt|s}} or more, it becomes a regular arrow and can be picked up as one.

=== Villager gifts ===
{{IN|java}}, arrows can be obtained as a reward item from [[fletcher]] [[villager]]s when the player has the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect.

=== Bartering ===
{{IN|Bedrock}}, arrows can be obtained through [[bartering]] with [[piglin]]s, and have a ~8.53% ({{frac|40|469}}) chance to give the [[player]] 6-12 arrows.

== Usage ==

=== Cauldrons ===
{{main|Cauldron#Holding potions}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, arrows can be used on [[Cauldron#Potions|cauldrons]] that contain [[potion]]s to create [[tipped arrow]]s.

| drag_float = true
}}

=== Spawning ===
An arrow entity spawns when an arrow item is shot out of a [[bow]], [[crossbow]], [[dispenser]], or a bow- or crossbow-wielding mob. Arrow entities spawn with a starting velocity calculated using the following process:

*The direction of the velocity is set as the facing vector of the entity that shot it, or the vector pointing straight out of a dispenser.
*The magnitude of the velocity is set as 0 to 3 for bows depending on how far they're drawn, 3.15 for crossbows, and 1.1 for dispensers.
*A random vector is added to the previously determined velocity. This vector ranges from <math display="inline">-0.0172275\cdot\text{inaccuracy}</math> to <math display="inline">0.0172275\cdot\text{inaccuracy}</math> on every axis. Inaccuracy is 1 for bows and crossbows, and 6 for dispensers.

Because crossbows shoot slightly faster arrows than bows but have the same inaccuracy, crossbows are actually more accurate because their randomness is smaller in proportion to their total velocity.

==== Critical arrow ====
{{For||Critical}}
Arrows fired by players from crossbows (or bows at [[critical charge]]) leave a trail of crit particles behind them. Critical arrows deal random damage, between {{hp|6}} and {{hp|11}} for bows at critical charge, and between {{hp|7}} and {{hp|11}} for crossbows.

=== Movement ===
An arrow entity follows this list of steps in order when calculating its movement each [[Tick|game tick]]:

* If it is intersecting a block's collision box, its <code>inGround</code> NBT value is set to true.
* If it is on fire and in rain, water, or powder snow (including cauldrons containing water or powder snow), its fire is extinguished.
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
* If <code>inGround</code> is true: <div class="mw-collapsible-toggle-placeholder"></div>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
:* If it is no longer intersecting a block's collision box:
::* <code>inGround</code> is set to false.
::* Its velocity in each axis is multiplied by a random number from 0 to 0.2.
:* Otherwise, it ticks its despawn timer.
</div></div>
* If <code>inGround</code> is false:
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
:* It calculates collisions with blocks and entities: <div class="mw-collapsible-toggle-placeholder"></div>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
::* It sets its target position to its current position plus its velocity.
::* It performs a raycast from its current position to the target position, checking for blocks to hit. If the raycast hits a block, the target position gets set to the point that was hit.
::* It performs a raycast from its position to the target position, checking for entities to hit.
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
::* If a block was found and no entity was found, handle effects from block collision: <div class="mw-collapsible-toggle-placeholder"></div>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
:::* The block is activated, if applicable. For example, [[Target|targets]] and wooden [[Button|buttons]] are activated here.
:::* The arrow's velocity is set to the target position minus the arrow position.
:::* The arrow is moved directly away from the target position by 0.05 blocks
:::* <code>inGround</code> is set to true.
:::* <code>crit</code> is set to false.
:::* <code>PierceLevel</code> is set to 0.
</div></div>
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed">
::* If any entity was found, handle effects from entity collision: <div class="mw-collapsible-toggle-placeholder"></div>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
:::* If the entity is an [[Enderman]], it is skipped.
:::* The arrow attempts to damage the entity. See the Damage section for more information. If the damage fails:
::::* If the entity has the [[Tag#List_of_tags|deflects_projectiles]] tag, the arrow's velocity is rotated a random angle about the Y axis and scaled by 0.5.
::::* Otherwise, its velocity is multiplied by -0.1.
</div></div>
</div></div>
:* Its velocity vector is added to its position vector.
:* Its velocity vector is multiplied by 0.99 if it's in air or 0.6 if it's in water (this is the "drag").
:*0.05 is subtracted from its velocity vector's y component (this is the "gravity").

The arrow movement (when not stuck in a block) can be solved as a recurrence relation to obtain the following formulas:

<math display="block">\vec{V_t} = 0.99^t\cdot\left(\vec{V_0}+\begin{bmatrix}0\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}\right)-\begin{bmatrix}0\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}</math>

<math display="block">\vec{P_t} = \vec{P_0}+100\cdot(1-0.99^t)\cdot\left(\vec{V_0}+\begin{bmatrix}0\\5\\0\end{bmatrix}\right)-\begin{bmatrix}0\\5t\\0\end{bmatrix}</math>

Where <math display="inline">\vec{V_t}</math> is the velocity at tick t and <math display="inline">\vec{P_t}</math> is the position at tick t. These formulas can quickly calculate the position and velocity at a future tick t given an initial position and velocity. To make them work for arrows in water instead, change 0.99 with 0.6 and 100 with 2.5.

{{:Calculators/Projectile motion|type=1|name=Arrow|gravity=-0.05|dragx=0.99|dragy=0.99|hideproperties=1}}

=== Damage ===
The damage an arrow inflicts on an entity depends on the [[#Entity data|damage NBT tag]], the [[#Entity data|crit NBT tag]], and the arrow's speed. However, {{in|bedrock}}, arrows shot from a dispenser do not scale damage with speed.

The damage NBT tag is determined by the item that shot it: It is 2 for everything except bows enchanted with [[Power]], in which case it's <math display="inline">2.5 + \frac{\text{power level}}{2}</math>.

The crit NBT tag is given to all arrows shot out of crossbows or fully charged bows.

The damage inflicted on an entity is <math display="inline">\text{damage NBT tag }\cdot\text{ speed}</math>, rounded up to a whole number. If the arrow has the crit NBT tag, it does an additional random amount of damage between 0 and <math>\frac{\text{damage}}{2}+2</math>.

=== Common properties ===
Arrows shot from a bow with the [[Flame]] enchantment, or shot through [[lava]] or [[fire]], catch on fire and show an appropriate animation until they pass through water or rain. They can set other entities they hit on fire for up to 5 seconds (inflicting up to {{hp|4}} of fire damage){{Citation needed}}, as well as ignite [[TNT]], [[candle]]s, and [[campfire]]s.

[[File:ArrowShotInTree.png|thumb|An arrow shot in a [[tree]]]]

Arrows also stick into blocks they come in contact with and remain there for one minute before disappearing. Such arrows may be [[#Picking up arrows|retrieved]]. The 1-minute despawn timer is then refreshed, meaning it takes another minute for the arrow to despawn.

Arrows can get visually stuck in players {{in|java}}, although not any mobs. They appear as regular arrows regardless of type.<ref>{{bug|MC-83933|||WAI}}</ref>
<gallery>
Steve got shot.png|Steve covered in arrows
Alex got shot.png|Alex covered in arrows
</gallery>

If the arrow has any custom potion effects (NBT tag <code>CustomPotionEffects</code>), all potion effects, including vanilla potion effects (NBT tag <code>Potion</code>) are removed 30 seconds after the arrow stops moving.

An arrow shot at a [[chorus flower]] or [[decorated pot]] breaks the block; a chorus flower drops itself, while a decorated pot shatters into [[pottery sherd]]s and/or [[brick]]s along with dropping any of the items stored inside.

Arrows stuck in blocks drop to the ground in a sharp arc if their supporting blocks are destroyed. Such arrows can still damage entities.

==== Redstone circuits ====
An arrow can activate a [[wooden button]], [[wooden pressure plate]], a [[tripwire]], or a [[target]]. An arrow continues to power these blocks until it is removed, either due to despawning, or being picked up. Target blocks emit a redstone pulse for one second, as opposed to the static depressed state of the other switches. Non-wooden switches are not affected by arrows.

===Mobs immune to arrows===
A few mobs cannot be shot using an arrow, because the arrow either disappears or it gets deflected. This includes:
* [[Endermen]] - even while immobile, the enderman is immune to damage from arrows;
* [[Breeze]];
* [[Wither]] under half health, when it gains wither armor;
* Closed [[shulker]]s;
* [[Ender dragon]], while sitting on top of the [[exit portal]].

==Issues==
{{issue list}}

==Trivia==
*By default, arrows fly slightly offset to the right. If the player stands close to a wall and fires several arrows without moving the crosshair, the arrows cluster around a point slightly to the right of the crosshair. If the player switches their main hand to be the left hand in options, the arrows instead cluster to the left.
*Arrows fired at [[Nether Portal]]s often skip through the portal block completely and fail to collide, thus continuing through to the opposite side of the block.
*Arrows stuck in blocks vibrate upon a world reload.<ref>{{bug|MC-93992||Arrow shakes when world loads|WF}}</ref>
