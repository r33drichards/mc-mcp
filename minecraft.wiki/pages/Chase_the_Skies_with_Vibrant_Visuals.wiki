}}'''Chase the Skies with Vibrant Visuals''' (stylized as '''CHASE THE SKIES WITH VIBRANT VISUALS''') is an official trailer for [[Chase the Skies]], including [[Vibrant Visuals]].

== Summary ==
[[Steve]] leads two [[horses]] and a [[ghastling]] over a cliff, only to discover [[Noor]] and [[Kai]] riding a [[happy ghast]]. The ghast flies high up into the clouds, as [[Makena]] and [[Ari]] watch from their own ghast, above a build of the name Minecraft. The duo head down, gracing an ocean [[Alex]] and [[Sunny]] are camping at. Makena and Ari dock as Sunny rehydrates a [[dried ghast]], while Kai and Noor arrive at a [[village]] being [[raided]]. The conquest is momentarily stopped as the illagers become perplexed by the appearance of a ghast.

Later, Sunny, Alex, Makena, and Ari share a ghast, as they check in on [[Zuri]] and [[Efe]] at a [[swamp]]. They also have a happy ghast, but are prioritizing [[slime blocks]]. In a [[bamboo jungle]], [[pandas]] are playing around and become memorized by the ghast, Kai holding up a [[cake]]. To Kai's right is Steve, fending off a random [[goat]], who launches Steve off a cliff and onto a happy ghast with Zuri and Efe.
