The '''Nether wastes''' or '''hell''' is the most common [[biome]] found in [[the Nether]].

== Description ==
The Nether wastes is the most common Nether biome and makes up around 36% of the Nether by volume. Unlike other Nether biomes, which tend to generate in large patches, the Nether wastes more often generates in thinner strips, often separating two or more other biomes. In particular, a thin strip of Nether wastes always separates the [[crimson forest]] and the [[basalt deltas]], or the [[warped forest]] and [[soul sand valley]], pairs of biomes that can never border each other.

The Nether wastes is a barren biome composed of mostly [[netherrack]]. It has extensive [[lava sea]]s with [[glowstone blob]]s hanging from the ceiling. Blobs of [[Nether quartz]], [[Nether gold ore]], and [[blackstone]] generate in the wastes (where [[ore]] is most visible) with the rarer [[ancient debris]] found unexposed within the terrain. [[Gravel]] and [[soul sand]] are found among its coastlines.

Most of [[the Nether]]'s [[mob]]s can spawn here, including [[ghast]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[strider]]s, [[piglin]]s, and the occasional [[endermen]]. [[Nether fortress]]es, [[ruined portals]] and [[bastion remnant]]s are present as well.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Nether biome|Nether Wastes}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|bedrock}}, if the Nether wastes is used as the biome for [[Overworld]] generation, although the terrain is entirely [[netherrack]], no ore is generated (including [[Nether quartz ore]], [[Nether gold ore]], [[ancient debris]], etc.). Caverns and lakes (with red-colored water) still generate. The [[player]] is still able to place water in an Overworld Nether wastes biome, but trying to sleep in a bed still causes an explosion.
