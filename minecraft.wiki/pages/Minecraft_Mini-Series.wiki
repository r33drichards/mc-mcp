== Trivia ==

=== Errors ===
* In Episode 2, the competitors build a shelter with 2 beds of each color, except for Purple, which only has 1 bed due to [[Quinn]] staying by herself. However, Quinn is a part of Team Stone Beach, whose color is Blue. Purple belongs to Team Tundra.
* In Episode 1, [[Bow]] and [[Gold]] tools have glitched models and textures.
