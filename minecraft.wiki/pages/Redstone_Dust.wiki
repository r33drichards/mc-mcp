'''Redstone dust''', internally known as '''redstone wire''' in block form and '''redstone''' in item form, is a mineral that can transmit [[Redstone circuits#Power|redstone power]] as a wire when placed as a [[block]]. It is also used in [[crafting]], [[brewing]] and as a [[trim material]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Redstone dust is immediately destroyed when broken.

Redstone dust is removed and drops as an item if:	
* its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed	
* [[water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space	
* a [[piston]] tries to push it or moves a block into its space

{{breaking row|Redstone Dust|horizontal=1}}
Redstone dust drops itself when destroyed.

=== Mining ===
{{see also|Redstone Ore#Natural generation}}
[[Redstone ore]] mined using an [[iron pickaxe]] or higher drops 4 or 5 redstone dust (or more with [[Fortune]], averaging at 6 redstone dust with Fortune III). If mined with [[Silk Touch]], the block drops itself instead of redstone dust. When the ore itself is clicked on/touched, it emits a light level of 9 and glows.

=== Natural generation ===
15 lengths of redstone dust are naturally generated as part of the trap in each [[jungle pyramid]]. 5 lengths of redstone dust can be found in one type of a jail cell room in a [[woodland mansion]]. In [[ancient cities]], multiple pieces of redstone dust can be found integrated into circuitry. 1 piece of redstone dust can be found in the "Encounter 4" room in [[trial chambers]].

=== Mob loot ===

=== Generated loot ===

=== Crafting ===
Redstone dust can be crafted from [[blocks of redstone]].

{{see also|Tutorial:Raid farming}}
{{IN|Java}}, when the player has the [[Hero of the Village]] status effect, clerics might throw that player a redstone dust as a gift.

== Usage ==
Redstone dust is used for [[#Brewing ingredient|brewing]], [[#Crafting ingredient|crafting]], and in redstone circuits by placing it on the ground to create [[#Redstone component|redstone wire]]. It can also be used to power redstone components.

=== {{anchor|Redstone dust}} Redstone component ===
When placed in the world, redstone dust becomes a block of redstone wire, which can transmit [[Redstone mechanics#Redstone signal|redstone signal]].

==== Placement ====
[[File:Redstone wire as circuit component.png|Examples of redstone wire configuration. ''Top Left:'' Redstone wire connects diagonally vertically through [[non-conductive]] blocks. ''Top Right:'' Redstone wire does ''not'' connect diagonally vertically through [[conductive]] blocks. ''Center:'' Redstone wire gets darker as its power level drops, to a maximum of 15 blocks from a power source.|thumb]]
[[File:Redstone on Glowstone, Stairs, Slabs.png|Examples of redstone wire placements.|thumb]]
Redstone dust can be placed on [[conductive]] blocks as well as [[glowstone]], upside-down [[slab]]s, [[glass]], upside-down [[stairs]], and [[hopper]]s. It can also be placed on some non-conductive blocks; see [[Opacity/Placement]] for more information. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.<ref>{{bug|MC-182709||Fire, soul fire, redstone wire and powered, detector and activator rails cannot be placed suspended without a supporting block via /setblock|Invalid}}</ref>

Redstone wire configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone [[Redstone components#Power components|power components]] and [[Redstone components#Transmission components|transmission component]] connection points. Redstone wire also configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone wire one block higher or lower – unless there is a [[conductive]] block above the lower redstone wire.

If there is only one such adjacent redstone component, redstone wire configures itself into a {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust}} line pointing both at the neighbor and away from it. If there are two or more such adjacent components, redstone wire connects them in the form of {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust}}, {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust-upleft}}, {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust-t-up}}, or {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust-cross}} as needed.

When there are no adjacent components, a single redstone wire configures itself into a {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust-cross}} plus sign, which can provide power in all four directions. By right-clicking, it can be changed into a {{BlockSprite|redstone-dust-dot}} dot, which does not provide power to any of the four directions.{{Only|java}}

Redstone wire does not automatically configure itself to point toward [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]]; the only exceptions are the back and side faces of [[piston]]s and [[sticky piston]]s {{In|bedrock}}. If such a configuration is desired, the other neighbors of the redstone wire must be arranged to create it, i.e the redstone dust must be placed in a way that it would be pointed at the block’s location even if it were not there.

When redstone wire is reconfigured after placement, it does not update other redstone components around it of the change unless that reconfiguration also includes a change in power level or another component provides an update. This can create situations where a mechanism component remains activated when it shouldn't, or vice versa, until it receives an update from something else – a "feature" of redstone wire that can be used to make a [[BUD|block update detector]].

==== Behavior ====

}}

Redstone wire can transmit power, which can be used to operate [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]] ([[door]]s, [[piston]]s, [[redstone lamp]]s, etc.).
Redstone wire can be "powered" by a number of methods:
* from an adjacent [[Redstone components#Power components|power component]] or a strongly-powered block
* from the output of a redstone repeater or redstone comparator
* from adjacent redstone wire. The powering dust can be a level higher or lower, but with restrictions:
** Redstone dust can be powered by redstone dust that is one level lower, or on a [[conductive]] block one level higher. A non-conductive block cannot{{only|java}} pass power downward.
** The block "between" the two dust blocks must be air or non-conductive. A conductive block there "cuts" the connection between the higher and lower dust.

The "power level" of redstone dust can vary from 0 to 15. Most power components power-up adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, but a few ([[daylight sensor]]s, [[trapped chest]]s, and [[weighted pressure plate]]s) may create a lower power level. Redstone repeaters output power level 15 (when turned on), but [[redstone comparator]]s may output a lower power level.

{{Schematic | caption =

Redstone wire can transmit power up to 15 blocks.

 |rt-$!|rd-$ew!+15|rd-$ew!+14|rd-$ew!+13|rd-$ew!+12|rd-$ew!+11|rd-$ew!+10|rd-$ew!+9
 |rd-$ew!+8|rd-$ew!+7|rd-$ew!+6|rd-$ew!+5|rd-$ew!+4|rd-$ew!+3|rd-$ew!+2|rd-$ew!+1|rd-$ew+0

}}
Power level drops by 1 for every block of redstone wire it crosses. Thus, redstone wire can transmit power for no more than 15 blocks. To go further, the power level must be re-strengthened – typically with a redstone repeater.

Powered redstone wire on top of, or pointing at, a [[conductive]] block provides ''weak'' power to the block. A weakly-powered block cannot power other adjacent redstone wire, but can still power redstone repeaters and comparators, and activate adjacent mechanism components. Non-conductive blocks cannot be powered.

When redstone wire is unpowered, it appears dark red. When powered, it becomes bright red at power level 15, fading to darker shades with decreasing power. Powered redstone wire also produces "dust" [[particles]] of the same color.

While redstone wire always provides power to the directions it points into, it can still point into directions in which it cannot give power. If redstone wire comes in the form of a cross, the player can right-click to toggle it between a cross and dot. A redstone dot does not power anything adjacent to it, but powers the block under it.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Redstone dust is destroyed when a [[piston]] tries to push it. It can't be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.
