A function [[Tag (Java Edition)|tag]] is a group of [[function (Java Edition)|functions]]. They can be called in the {{cmd|function}} command with {{cd|#{{ph|resource location}}}}, which runs all the functions specified in the tag in the order of their first appearance in a tag. If a function is referenced multiple times in a tag and its sub-tags, it is run once.

Moreover, functions tagged in the {{cd|minecraft:tick}} tag run every tick at the start of the tick and functions tagged in {{cd|minecraft:load}} run once at the start of the tick after a server (re)load.

== List of tags ==
This is a list of all function tags used directly by Minecraft. They are in the {{cd|minecraft}} namespace. Adding a function to these tags has a direct effect. 

=== load ===
Functions in this tag run when the world loads, or after a reload.

{{tag_list|load|type=function}}

=== tick ===
Functions in this tag run at the beginning of every tick.

{{tag_list|tick|type=function}}
