[[File:Spruce variants.png|thumb|312x312px|All existing spruce and pine variants]]
'''Spruces''' and '''pines''' are [[tree]]s with dark bark and brown wood. They have growth patterns and requirements similar to [[birch]]es, although they appear different. They are mainly found in the [[taiga]] biome, but they may also generate in [[windswept forest]]s, [[windswept hills]]{{only|java|short=1}}, [[snowy plains]], [[snowy taiga]]s, [[old growth taiga]]s, and [[grove]]s.

== Appearance ==
Spruces come in several different variants with different properties:
* Spruces are the most common variant with a height between 5 and 12 blocks. The leaves tend to grow in discrete rows rather than the more spherical arrangement of oaks and birch trees. {{IN|bedrock}}, only this variant can be grown using saplings.
* Pines are a fairly tall variant of spruces which generate in a matchstick style, with only a few leaves at the top, with a rare variant which is small.
* Mega spruces are larger variants of spruces which generate in the [[old growth spruce taiga]] and rarely in the [[old growth pine taiga]]. They have considerably more leaves than the mega pine. In ''Bedrock Edition'', only this variant can be grown using saplings.
* Mega pines are a larger variant of pines which generate only in the [[old growth pine taiga]]. These pines have few leaves, concentrated at the top, and can be grown from spruce saplings arranged in a 2×2 square, with or without bone meal.

[[File:Podzol Pattern.png|thumb|The maximum horizontal reach of podzol that can generate from a mega spruce tree.]]
In an amplified taiga or old growth taiga, some of the spruces generate with snow on them, just like in the other cold biomes.

When mega spruces grow, they convert any [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[mycelium]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]]s and [[Pale Moss Block|pale moss blocks]] up to a radius of 6 blocks to [[podzol]], centered on the south-eastern sapling.

Like birches, they do not grow branches. When height-constrained, the trunk height maximum is two less than the roof. The headroom of 9 blocks limits the tree to a trunk height of 7, which enables harvesting from ground level.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of spruce.
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Wood}} (created from logs in the inventory crafting grid)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Spruce Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Spruce Wood}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on wood)
* {{BlockLink|Spruce Sapling}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Vines}}{{only|be}} (harvested with shears from dying trees)

== Planting ==
Spruce [[sapling]]s may be planted and grown on:
{{columns-list|
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
}}
1×1 spruces require a 5×5 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree and 1 level above; that is, a sapling planted in a hole 2 blocks deep can still grow.

To grow a 2×2 tree (be it mega spruce or mega pine), four saplings must be placed adjacent to each other in a square. For growth to succeed, the three adjacent blocks outside the northwest corner of the square must be clear. Also, there must be an unobstructed 5×5 column of blocks centered on the northwestern sapling, starting from the top of the sapling and at least 14 blocks tall (15 blocks including the sapling), or up to the final height of the tree, which can be 30 blocks above ground. [[Bone meal]] can be used on any of the saplings to accelerate growth.

2x2 spruce trees convert nearby dirt type blocks to [[Podzol]] when grown.

== Other spruce variants ==

Spruce trees can generate as one of the two following variants of the normal tree. Both of these generate naturally, and can be grown out of normal saplings.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143349/http://i.imgur.com/hTg0N8J.gifv</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-21304}}</ref>

=== Fallen spruces and pines ===
{{main|Fallen tree}}
[[File:Spruce Fallen Log.png|200px|Fallen spruce log.]]

A fallen spruce may consist of a single upright log, or a stump. Logs lying on their side are often found 1–2 blocks from the stump. They occasionally have [[mushroom]]s on top.

A fallen spruce log has a length of 6–10 blocks, and the stump is never covered with vines.

=== Dying spruces ===
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Dying Trees.jpg|thumb|The different dying tree types.]]
Dying spruces and dying pines retain their standard growth pattern. However, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with [[vines]].
{{-}}

== Foliage colors ==
{{main|Tint}}
Spruce leaves do not follow the [[tint|foliage color]] rules that cause the trees to appear in different colors in different [[biome]]s. Spruce leaves are always the same color regardless of the biome. {{IN|bedrock}}, however, they turn white as other leaves do during [[snowfall]] in snowy biomes.

== Trivia ==
* In real life, "spruce" refers to any member of the [[wikipedia:spruce|''Picea'']] genus of trees.
**Although the leaves of real-life spruce trees are typically referred to as "needles", the [[leaves]] of spruce trees in ''Minecraft'' are still called "spruce leaves" as well as producing leaf particles and being able to be smelted into [[Leaf Litter|leaf litter]].
