<onlyinclude>
'''v0.8.0 alpha build 1''' (labelled '''v0.8.0 alpha''' in-game and '''0.8.0_test1''' internally) is the first build version for [[Pocket Edition v0.8.0 alpha|v0.8.0 alpha]] and the first ever build compiled in 2013. It was never officially released to the public; however, the client was uploaded on Google Play. There are two uploads that are functionally identical.

Since this version contains commands, which would not be officially added to the game until [[v0.16.0 alpha]], it is likely to be a [[developer build]].

* All of the 11 commands are freely accessible in both Creative and Survival mode.
* No [[target selectors]] are available; a player's name has to be entered in order to target them.
* Boolean arguments do not accept strings as valid input. "0" is considered "false" and all other integers are considered "true."
* <s>Strikethrough text</s> indicates arguments which the player is unable to specify due to a bug.
* Command arguments do not have known names. Unofficial names are provided in the syntax below for readability.
