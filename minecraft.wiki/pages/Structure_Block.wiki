A '''structure block''' is used to generate structures manually. They can also be used to save and load structures, alongside [[structure void]] blocks.

== Obtaining ==
Structure blocks are available using the {{cmd|setblock}}, {{cmd|fill}}, or {{cmd|give}} commands, and are available in the [[Creative inventory]] {{in|Java}}. When placed, structure blocks are unbreakable in [[Survival]] and have the same blast resistance as [[bedrock]]. {{IN|be}}, only save-mode structure blocks are obtainable through commands.

== Usage ==
When placed, {{control|use}} the structure block to open its GUI. The GUI opens only if the player is in [[Creative]] mode, and has [[permission level]] 2 or higher.

Once a structure is named, its name appears above the structure block when highlighted, preceded by the block mode (e.g. "Save:minecraft:example").{{only|je}}

Switching between modes preserves the settings of the structure block wherever possible.

In item form, the structure block uses a "blank" texture, a texture that is not used when on a placed block.

Structure blocks can't be moved by [[piston]]s, and can't be destroyed by the [[ender dragon]].

=== Save ===
[[File:StructureSaveGUI.png|thumb|250px|Save mode GUI for Java Edition]]
[[File:Structure Block Bedrock ClassicUI.png|thumb|250px|Save mode GUI for Bedrock Edition]]

{{BlockSprite|Structure Block Save}} '''Save''' mode allows the player to highlight a structure in the world and save it to memory, level file,{{only|be}} or a separate file.

; Structure Name
: A text box for entering the [[resource location]] of the structure to be saved. Only [[Resource location#Legal characters|some characters]] are allowed. {{IN|bedrock}}, it has a "mystructure:" prefix by default.

; Relative Position
: The X, Y, and Z offsets of the structure, relative to the bottom north-west corner of the structure block. Sets the origin of the structure outline.
: {{IN|je}}, the origin must be at most 48 blocks away in all directions. {{IN|be}}, the origin must be at most 64 blocks away horizontally, and 384 blocks vertically.

; Structure Size
: X, Y, and Z offset from the Relative Position coordinates. This sets the opposite corner of the structure, and defines the structure's size.
: The maximum structure size is 48x48x48 {{In|je}} and 64x384x64 {{In|be}}.
: When successful, generates an outline surrounding the structure that's mostly white except for the red, green and blue lines that represent the X, Y and Z axis. {{IN|be}}, the structure also gets previewed with a rotatable 3D model inside of the structure block's GUI.

; Detect structure size and position
: Automatically calculates the size and position of the structure using a corner block placed on the opposite corner of the structure.
: The name of the structure in the save block '''must''' match the name within the corner block, or the size calculation fails.
: Two corner blocks can also be used. It uses the second corner block instead of the structure block.

; Remove blocks {{only|be|short=1}}
: When saving the structure, if enabled, no [[block]]s are included in the structure.

; Include entities
: When saving the structure, if this option is on, saves any [[entities]] within the structure as well.

; Save
: When all coordinates and a structure name have been entered, press this button to save the structure.
: {{IN|java}}, this saves the structure to a file. The name of the structure is the name of the file.
:: Structures can be saved to a file only by manually pressing this button. If a structure block in Save mode is instead powered by [[Redstone_components|redstone]], the structure is only saved in memory. This is the case even if a file for that structure already exists on disk. Reloading the world clears any structures stored in memory. This is for unspecified security reasons.<ref>{{bug|MC-105595|||WAI}}</ref>
:: If no namespace is specified, a default value of <code>minecraft</code> is used. This can be changed by prefixing the structure name with <code><namespace>:</code> in the structure block.
:: Structures are saved in <code>.minecraft/saves/(WorldName)/generated/(namespace)/structures</code>. <ref group="note" name="before1.13">Structures created in versions before [[Java Edition 1.13|1.13]] are saved in <code>.minecraft/saves/(WorldName)/structures</code>.</ref>
: {{IN|be}}, this saves the structure into the level database file rather than a standalone file. The structure block can be configured to either save to memory or to disk (the level file) when activated by redstone.

; Export {{only|be|short=1}}
: Used to export a structure into a <code>.mcstructure</code> file, which can be used to load from the <code>structures</code> folder of a behavior pack. If the structure contains a custom block from a behavior pack, then the block is also saved on the structure block. This option is only available on Windows 10 devices by default and Android with [[resource pack#Bedrock Edition|resource packs]] however, starting with version [[1.21.130]], the button becomes completely useless on Android, as exporting to unsupported platforms has been removed.

=== Load ===
[[File:StructureLoadGUI.png|thumb|250px|Load Mode GUI for Java Edition]]
[[File:Structure Block Bedrock ClassicUI Load.png|thumb|250px|Load Mode GUI for Bedrock Edition]]

{{BlockSprite|Structure Block Load}} '''Load''' mode allows the player to load and rotate saved structures.

;Structure Name
:The name of the structure to load.
:{{IN|java}}, structures are searched in the following order:
:* from memory
:* from a file (<code>.minecraft/saves/''&lt;World Name>''/generated/''&lt;namespace>''/structures/</code>)
:* from data packs
:* built-in structures from [[minecraft.jar]]
:{{IN|bedrock}}, structures are searched for in the following order:
:* from memory
:* from disk (level database)
:* from a behavior pack
:{{IN|bedrock}}, vanilla NBT structure files cannot be loaded with structure block.

;Relative Position
:The X, Y, and Z offsets of the structure, relative to the bottom north-west corner of the structure block. Coordinates may be specified as numbers between -48 and 48 {{IN|je}}, or between -64 and 64 {{IN|be}}{{info needed|does this also allow for 384 blocks vertically like save mode?}}.

;Show bounding box
:Highlights the outline of the structure. On by default.

;Structure Integrity and Seed
:Removes random blocks that compose the structure based on a user-defined seed.

:Lower integrity values result in more blocks being removed. The integrity value must be between 0.0 and 1.0{{only|je|short=1}} or 100.00{{only|be|short=1}}.

;Strict Placement{{only|je|short=1}}
:When on, the blocks of the structure do not emit [[block updates]] or run their post-placement code when the structure gets loaded.

;Include entities
:Include any entities saved in the structure file when loading the structure. Off by default.

;Waterlog blocks {{only|be|short=1}}
:When loading the structure blocks that replace water become [[waterlogged]] instead of replacing blocks with air, creating air pockets. 

;Remove blocks {{only|be|short=1}}
:When loading the structure, don't include any [[block]]s from the saved structure.

;Rotation (0, 90, 180, 270)
:Sets the rotation of the structure to 0° (no rotation), 90° clockwise, 180° clockwise, and 270° clockwise (or 90° counter-clockwise).

;Mirror (¦, <>, ^v)
:Sets the mirroring of the structure to none (<code>¦</code>), left to right (<code>&lt; &gt;</code>), or front to back (<code>^ v</code>). At 0° rotation <code>&lt; &gt;</code> mirrors across the X-axis and <code>^ v</code> mirrors across the Z-axis.{{info needed|how do mirror and rotation behave when combined?}}
:{{IN|be}}, the options are x and z, which can be toggled to set mirroring.

;Animation mode {{only|be|short=1}}
:Select the animation to show how structure is loaded. Place by layer make structure loaded layer by layer, place by block make structure loaded one block by block. Default to none.
:Once the loading has started, breaking the structure block can not stop the loading process.
:Loading with animation may break blocks in structures that contain multiple parts (such as beds, doors, or tall grass), or need to be attached to other blocks (such as torches), and may cause water, lava, and fire to spread out.

;Animation time {{only|be|short=1}}
:Adjust the animation time for loading the structure.

;Load
:Press to load the structure.
:{{IN|java}}, press this button once to prepare the outline preview of the structure. When satisfied with the position, press again to generate the structure.
:A redstone signal will also activate the structure block and load the structure.

=== Corner ===
[[File:StructureCornerGUI.png|thumb|250px|Corner Mode GUI for Java Edition.]]
[[File:StructureCorner_BedrockGUI.jpg|thumb|250px|Corner Mode GUI for Bedrock Edition.|link=Special:FilePath/StructureCorner_BedrockGUI.jpg]]

{{BlockSprite|Structure Block Corner}} '''Corner''' mode allows for an easier and automatic size calculation while saving or loading structures.

:To use, place on the opposite corner of a save structure block or a second corner structure block. Then, using a save block, press "DETECT".
:When successful, a bounding outline appears.

;Structure Name
:The name of the structure on which to calculate the size and position.
:Name is case sensitive{{only|be}}, it must match exactly with the name provided by the complementary save or corner structure block.

=== Data ===
[[File:StructureDataGUI.png|thumb|250px|Data mode GUI for Java Edition.]]
[[File:DataModeBedrock.png|thumb|250px|Data Mode GUI for Bedrock Edition.]]

{{BlockSprite|Structure Block Data}} '''Data''' is a deprecated mode, which is superseded by the jigsaw block, but still used in some certain vanilla structures (igloo, end city, woodland mansion, ocean ruin, shipwreck). Structure blocks in data mode can be used only during natural generation. They mark the location to run a specified hardcoded function, which can be used only for relevant structures. {{IN|java}}, this mode is hidden unless the {{key|Alt}} key is held while switching from Corner mode. {{IN|bedrock}}, data mode structure block cannot be obtained with commands.

;Custom Data Tag Name
:The name of the function to run. 
:;[[Igloo]]
::"chest" - sets the [[loot table]] for a chest beneath the structure block to "chests/igloo_chest" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.
:;[[End city]]
::"Chest" - Sets the loot table for a chest beneath the structure block to "chests/end_city_treasure" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.
::"Sentry" - Creates a [[shulker]] at the location of the structure block.
::"Elytra" - Creates an [[item frame]] entity with an [[elytra]] item inside it at the location of the structure block.
:;[[Woodland mansion]]
::"ChestSouth" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to "chests/woodland_mansion" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.
::"ChestNorth" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to "chests/woodland_mansion" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.
::"ChestEast" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to "chests/woodland_mansion" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.
::"ChestWest" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to "chests/woodland_mansion" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.

:;[[Ocean ruins]]
::"chest" - Creates a chest at the location of the structure block, setting its loot table to either "chests/underwater_ruin_big" or "chests/underwater_ruin_small", with seed dependent on the world seed.
::"drowned" - Creates a [[drowned]] at the location of the structure block.
:;[[Shipwreck]]
::"map_chest" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to "chests/shipwreck_map" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.

=== 3D Export ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:ExportModeBedrock.png|thumb|250px|Export Mode GUI]]

{{BlockSprite|Structure Block Export}} '''3D Export''' mode,{{Note|Only available on Windows 10}} is similar to [[#Save|save mode]], but the structure is saved as a 3D render in the format of <code>.glb</code> rather than as an actual structure.<ref>{{ytl|OKIfw1fjSlY|How to Use Structure Blocks in Minecraft: Education Edition|Minecraft: Education Edition|August 2, 2018}}</ref> Therefore, structures saved this way can be viewed with 3D Viewer<ref>https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/3d-viewer/9NBLGGH42THS</ref> or Paint 3D<ref>https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/paint-3d/9NBLGGH5FV99</ref>, but cannot be generated via [[#Load|load mode]].

The 3D file exported is basically the same as the real-time rendering in the preview. Animated textures such as Nether portal blocks, liquids, magma, etc. only have a static texture. Some blocks cannot be displayed properly, such as piston arms, chests, beds, etc. including entities is not supported in this mode.

Structure blocks in 3D export mode cannot be activated by redstone.

3D export can't be used in Marketplace world templates.

;Structure Name
:Enter the name of the structure. Case sensitive. The player must enter a file name in order to export.

;Relative Position
:Enter the X, Y, and Z values for the structure here, based on the position of the structure block. Sets the origin of the structure outline.
:Maximum allowed distance from the structure block is 64 blocks in any direction.

;Structure Size
:Enter the X, Y, and Z values to set the distance from the Relative Position coordinates. This sets the opposite corner of the structure, and defines its size.
:Maximum structure size is 64×384×64.

;Remove Blocks
:While exporting the structure, doesn't include any blocks within saved structure.
