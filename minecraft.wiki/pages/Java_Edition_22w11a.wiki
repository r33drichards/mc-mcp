'''[[File:Mangrove Propagule JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Mangrove Propagule]]'''
* A new type of sapling.
* Can be grown by bonemealing the mangrove leaves, grows from the exposed bottom of it.
** Propagules can also grow spontaneously from leaves, but only if they're naturally generated (not player-placed leaves).
** Have 4 stages to fully grown, can be accelerated by bonemealing.
* Can break off a fully grown one, and plant it to grow a mangrove tree (currently not added, generates an oak tree instead).
* Can be planted underwater.
* Can be placed in [[flower pot]]s.
* [[Bee]]s can pollinate them.

'''[[File:Sculk JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk]]'''
* Generates in the [[deep dark]] biome.

* Sculk blocks grow when a [[mob]] dies near a [[sculk catalyst]].

'''[[File:Sculk Catalyst JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Sculk Catalyst]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome.
* Emits soul particles after a mob dies within 8 blocks, and grows sculk-related blocks.
** Spreads sculk blocks to wherever a nearby mob dies. The amount it spreads depends on the amount of experience the mob is meant to drop.
*** Even if the mob doesn't drop experience as it wasn't killed by a [[player]], the blocks would still spread based on the amount of experience it normally drops.
*** Experience does not drop in these cases.
** The charge decays over time, faster the furthest away from the catalyst it moves.
*** If a charge decays more than 4 blocks away from the catalyst, it has a chance of creating either a [[sculk sensor]] (90%) or a [[sculk shrieker]] (10%).
*** If a charge decays more than 24 blocks away from the catalyst, it merely vanishes.
* Drops only experience when broken without Silk Touch.
* Emits a light level of 6.
* [[File:Sculk Catalyst Bloom.gif|32px]] Blooms when activated.
* Can spread sculk only on blocks in the <code>sculk_replaceable</code> [[tag]].

'''[[File:Sculk Shrieker JE1 BE2.gif|32px]] [[Sculk Shrieker]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome.
* Has two soul-shaped patterns in the center.
* Drops only experience when broken without Silk Touch.
* Currently doesn't do anything due to the warden not being in this snapshot.

'''[[File:Sculk Vein JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] [[Sculk Vein]]'''
* Generates in the deep dark biome on the edge of sculk patches.
* Generates in a layer on top of blocks and can be placed in all directions, like [[glow lichen]].
* Has an animated texture.
* Some have parts that are transparent, allowing the player to see the block it is on top of.
* Can be [[waterlogged]].
* Drops nothing when broken without Silk Touch.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Bucket of Tadpole JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bucket of Tadpole]]'''
* Can be obtained by catching a tadpole using a water bucket.

'''[[File:Mangrove Boat JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Boat#Mangrove|Mangrove Boat]]'''
* Crafted with mangrove planks.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Frog Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Frog spawn egg]] 
* [[File:Tadpole Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Tadpole spawn egg]]

=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Temperate Frog JE1 BE1.gif; Warm Frog JE1 BE1.gif; Cold Frog JE1 BE1.gif|32px}} [[Frog]]s'''
* Can croak, jump, swim, and slowly walk on land.
** Are able to jump over 5 blocks.
** Are faster in water than on land.
** Preferred to jump to [[lily pad]] and [[big dripleaf]].
* Have {{hp|10}} health points.
* Come in three variants: temperate, warm, and cold.
** The temperate variant is orange, the warm variant is white, and the cold variant is green.
* Eat small [[slime]]s, dropping [[slimeball]]s in the process.
* Can be tempted and bred using slimeballs.
** Lay eggs on water after mating.
* Grow from tadpoles.
** Variants depend on the [[Biome#Temperature_2|temperature]] of the biome it turns from a tadpole to a frog in.

'''[[File:Tadpole swimming.gif|32px]] [[Tadpole]]s'''
* Jump around like fish when on land, and eventually die.
* Grow up into frogs after 20 minutes in the world, which can be sped up using slimeballs.
** Frog type dependent on which temperature a tadpole grows in.
* Have {{hp|6}} health points.
* Are hunted down by [[axolotl]]s.
* Can be held in a [[water bucket]].

=== World generation ===
'''{{BiomeLink|Deep Dark|link=Deep Dark}}'''
* New biome at the "deepest depths of the world".
* Tends to generate under continental/mountainous areas, exclusively within the [[deepslate]] layer between Y=-1 and Y=-64.
** Currently can extend above the deepslate layer, sometimes up to around Y=33.
* The surface is covered in sculk and contains all sculk-related blocks.
* With the exception of [[Monster Spawner|spawner]]s, no mobs can spawn there, similar to [[mushroom field]]s.

'''Upgrading of old worlds'''
* Now support 3D biome blending, so it blends the underground biomes as well.

=== General ===
'''[[Chunk format]]'''
* Added <code>blending_data.min_section</code> and <code>blending_data.max_section</code> that determines which sections are used for data for blending.

'''[[Data pack]] and [[resource pack]]'''
* Can have <code>filter</code> section in {{samp|pack.mcmeta}} now.
** This section has a mandatory field <code>block</code>, which is a list of patterns (regular expressions) for namespaces and paths.
** If any of the files in packs added before one with <code>filter</code> section matches any pattern inside <code>block</code>, it is filtered out (i.e. treated as if not present in the first place).
** <code>filter</code> section does not apply to a pack containing it, only to packs loaded before it.
** Both <code>namespace</code> and <code>path</code> can be omitted: if they are, the game works as if they had been specified as a ".*". The missing field matches every value. When they are included, these fields contain a regular expression pattern.
** For example, adding a pack with this section in {{samp|pack.mcmeta}} after the vanilla pack hides all recipes and advancements defined by the vanilla pack:
:::<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
"filter": {
    "block": [
        {
            "namespace": "minecraft",
            "path": "recipes/.*"
        },
        {
            "namespace": "minecraft",
            "path": "advancements/.*"
        }
    ]
}
</syntaxhighlight>
* World presets/types and super flat world [[presets]] in “Create World” screen can now be controlled by datapacks.
** New registry types <code>worldgen/world_preset</code> and <code>worldgen/flat_level_generator_preset</code> were added to data-driven presets (like "Amplified" or "Single Biome").

'''[[Debug screen]] and profiling'''
* Added estimated GPU utilization percentage to performance profiling metrics and F3 debug screen.
** This is available only for graphics devices that support GPU timer queries.
* Added "Blending" row, above the "Noise Router" row.

'''[[Font]]s'''
* Added new glyph provider type <code>space</code>, to allow creation of space-like glyphs.
** New provider has a single argument called <code>advances</code> which is a map of a codepoint to glyph advance (width).
** Rendering of space glyph is no longer hardcoded (needs to be declared manually in the font).

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Directional Audio" sound option, for 3D Directional Audio simulation.
** Uses HRTF-based directional audio to improve the simulation of 3D sound, making it easier to distinguish which direction a sound comes from (including if it is above or below the player).
** Requires HRTF-compatible audio hardware.
** This option is best experienced with headphones.
** Toggled off by default.

'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added three new particles: <code>sculk_soul</code>, <code>sculk_charge_pops</code>, and <code>sculk_charge</code>.

'''{{samp|[[server.properties]]}}'''
* Added server property <code>max-chained-neighbor-updates</code> to limit the number of consecutive neighbor updates before skipping additional ones. Negative values remove the limit.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added the following splash text:
** "Shriek like a Sculk Shrieker!"
** "Who let the frogs out?"
** "RIBBIT!"
** "Croak team!"
** "Nooooooooooooo!"
** "Flower forest TM perfume"
** "Hat Fridays!"
