A '''wolf''' is a [[neutral mob]] that can be [[tamed]] using [[bone]]s. Tamed wolves defend their owners against attackers and can assist in combat. They can also be equipped with [[Wolf Armor|wolf armor]].

== Spawning ==
Wild wolves spawn naturally in multiple biomes on [[grass block]]s, [[coarse dirt]], [[snow]] ({{in|java}} only on 8 layers of snow), [[snow block]]s or [[podzol]]. They have a 10% chance of spawning naturally as a baby. Their appearance and the amount of wolves that attempt to spawn depend on the biome.

{{Mob spawn table|Wolf}}

=== Color variants ===
{{Redirect|Wolf variant|the definition of wolf variants in data packs|Mob variant definitions#Wolf}}
Wolves have 9 color variants, each of which spawns in a different biome. Most variants spawn in packs, with some having larger or smaller packs.

When a wolf pack spawns near a biome border, individual wolves of the pack might take on a different appearance if their spawn location is in a bordering biome.<ref>{{bug|MC-269144||Wolf pack spawning on biome borders results in default wolves|WAI}}</ref>

Wolves spawned in [[jungle]]s or [[bamboo jungle]]s (using [[spawn egg]]s, [[monster spawner]]s, [[command]]s, or due to a wolf pack bordering these biomes) spawn as rusty wolves; wolves in [[savanna]]s or [[windswept savanna]]s spawn as spotted wolves; wolves in [[badlands]] or [[eroded badlands]] spawn as striped wolves. Wolves in all other biomes spawn as the pale variant.

<gallery widths="280" heights="200">
Wolf variants.png|All of the nine wolf color variants. Order: snowy, striped, spotted, rusty, chestnut, black, ashen, woods, and pale.
</gallery>

For pictures of individual color variants, see {{slink||Gallery}}.

=== Sound variants ===
Wolves have 7 sound variants; big, classic, cute, puglin, angry, grumpy, and sad. These variants are meant to reflect a wolf's personality,<ref>{{mcnet|/test-new-egg-citing-features|Test new egg-citing features|February 19, 2025|Linn Viberg}}</ref> but have no effect on the wolf's behavior.

Wolf sound variants are assigned independently of a wolf's spawning biome, with a 14.2% chance of spawning for one of each sound variant. Wolves will make the sounds associated with their variant when they make bark, pant, whine, growl, death, or hurt sounds. Sound variants are unrelated to color variants. Similarly, the angry sound variant is unrelated to the {{EntitySprite|angry-wolf}} angry wolf state.

For all wolf sounds, see {{Slink|2=Sounds}}.

== Drops ==
Adult wolves drop {{xp|1|3}} [[experience]] orbs when killed by a [[player]] or a tamed wolf. {{IN|be}}, a tamed wolf that is killed by its owner does not drop experience.

Wolves wearing [[wolf armor]] always drop their wolf armor when they die, regardless of what kills them.

Upon successful [[breeding]], {{xp|1|7}} are dropped.

Like other baby animals, baby wolves will drop no experience when killed.

== Behavior ==
{{Anchor|Behavior and appearance}}
[[File:Begging Tame Wolf.png|thumb|upright|A tamed pale wolf "begging" the player for food or admiring bones if held by the player.]]
[[File:Dog Trio.png|thumb|Three tamed pale wolves following the player around.]]

Wolves exhibit three different states depending on how the user interacts with them:

* {{EntitySprite|wolf}} '''Untamed'''{{Anchor|Wild Wolf}} wolves have a drooping tail and their eyes consist of a white pixel and a black pixel for the pupil (on each side). They are neutral toward the [[player]]. They are hostile toward [[sheep]], [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es, baby [[turtle]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[bogged]], and [[parched]], taking on their angry appearance while attacking these mobs, and changing back when the targeted mob dies or moves out of range. They chase [[bat]]s despite being unable to reach them.<ref>{{bug|MC-9925||Wolf chasing bats- Works as intended or not?|WAI}}</ref> They avoid [[llama]]s, although wolves will always attack a llama that spits on them. They do not [[despawn]], even if they are in an unloaded chunk, or 32 blocks away from the [[player]]. They can be ridden by baby [[zombie]] variants.{{only|be|short=yes}}
* {{EntitySprite|angry-wolf}} '''Angry'''{{Anchor|Hostile Wolf}} wolves are characterized by their constant growling and fearsome appearance. Wild wolves become hostile when they are either attacked by a [[player]] or [[mob]], if not killed in one hit<ref>{{bug|MC-2432||Pack of wild Wolves / Zombified piglins / Silverfish / Bees not becoming aggressive at one hit kill|WAI}}</ref>, or when they see a [[mob]] they want to eat. Their tail is held out straight, their eyes become blood red, their mouth is raised in a slight snarl, and they have angry eyebrows. Angry wolves are hostile only to the players or mobs that attacked them, or to the mobs they are hunting. They can see attackers even if they are under the invisibility effect, but they cannot track the attacker down if they get out of their render distance, or the attacker was able to unload the [[chunk]] where the wolves were. Notice that only the damage done to players gets scaled by difficulty, all other mobs will receive {{hp|4}} damage regardless of diffiiculty. Angry wolves cannot be [[leash]]ed, but a wild wolf may become angry while it is still leashed without dropping the lead.
* {{EntitySprite|tamed-wolf}} '''Tamed''' {{Anchor|Tamed Wolf}} wolves have friendlier-looking eyes, and more hp than the untamed wolf. They have a default red collar around their neck, which can be dyed {{control|using}} one of the sixteen colored [[dye]]s on the wolf by the owner of the wolf. Pressing {{Control|use}} on the wolf makes it sit and remain in place, and not follow the player. Tamed wolves that are not sitting attack players or mobs that their owner attacks, or those that injure their owner unless the target has the same owner or is on the same [[team]], dealing them {{hp|4}} damage regardless of difficulty. They do not attack [[creeper]]s or [[ghast]]s. Standing tamed wolves attack only skeletons and their variants without provocation. Kills by tamed wolves count as player kills: this means mobs killed by a tamed wolf can drop [[experience]], [[rare drops]] or [[Drops#Equipped items|equipped items]]. Tamed wolves are always passive to the [[player]], even if the player hits them or kills a tamed wolf on the same team. 

A wolf becomes hostile to a player or other mob that attacks it unless the attacker is the wolf's owner, or is otherwise on the same team, or if killed in one hit.
It also causes wild wolves and standing tamed wolves in a 33×21×33 cuboid centered on the attacked wolf to become hostile to the attacker, allowing coordination for attacks and team hunts (only in wild wolves).

{{IN|java}}, any tamed wolf attacked by a player/mob causes all standing wolves on that team to attack that player/mob who attacked the tamed wolf.

Skeletons and their variants, foxes, baby turtles and passive rabbits actively avoid both tamed and wild wolves. {{EntityLink|id=killer-bunny|Killer rabbit}}s{{only|java|short=1}} attack wolves actively. Sheep ignore wolves, but flee when attacked by one. Sheep ignore tamed wolves but also do not flee from them.

When a [[player]] within 8 blocks holds [[meat]] or [[bone]]s near a wolf, the wolf tilts its head as if to 'beg' for the food for 2 to 4 seconds.

The behavior of baby wolves is the same as adult tamed wolves. Baby wolves have large heads, similar to other baby animals.

Wolves are 0.85{{only|java|short=1}} or 0.8{{only|bedrock|short=1}} blocks tall and baby wolves are 0.425{{only|java|short=1}} or 0.4{{only|bedrock|short=1}} blocks tall.

The textures of the wolves are tinted dark gray once submerged in water.

In Peaceful [[difficulty]], attacking a wild wolf aggravates the wolf and its group, but they deal no damage to the [[player]].

=== Movement ===
[[File:Wolf shaking.gif|thumb|A tamed pale wolf shaking off water.]]
Standing tamed wolves wander randomly when near their owner, but follow if more than 10 blocks away and teleport to a nearby free block (if any) if more than 12 blocks away. Besides making travel easier, teleportation can be used to rescue them from [[lava]], [[water]] or pits, as they immediately teleport to a safe area.

* Wolves can be told to "sit" by pressing {{control|use}} on them and made to stand again with another press of {{control|use}}.
** {{IN|java}}, a wolf automatically sits when first tamed.
** While sitting, they do not follow the player. However, if their owner fights a mob near them, they are still likely to join the fight. When the fight is over, they go back to sitting (if in water, they do not sit until they are on dry land, telling the wolf to sit makes it stand). They sit at their new location instead of returning to wherever they were previously.
** Wolves stand up and follow the player if it is pushed into water or injured while sitting.
* Wolves can either attack (within 16 blocks) or flee from (within 24 blocks) [[llama]]s. The wolves' speed is increased by 50% when they flee.
* Wolves find paths to their targets if attacking within 16 blocks, even in difficult terrain. They also navigate along the edges of cliffs and occasionally fall far enough to take [[damage]] if they leap.
* Wolves attack their targets running about at the player's walking speed and by leaping at them in exactly the same manner as [[spider]]s, but cause no damage while in midair. Tamed wolves attack any animal the player starts to attack. They also can navigate and turn around in 1×1 horizontal tunnels.
* After emerging from water, a wolf shakes the water off their fur. This is represented by an animation and water [[particles]].

=== Teleportation ===
Tamed wolves [[Teleportation|teleport]] to their owner if they are more than 12 blocks away, unless the owner is not directly touching the ground{{verify|Is this true for both editions? See also talk page}} (e.g. using [[elytra]], swimming, flying, in a [[boat]]).

Tamed wolves teleport to a block on the edge of a 5×1×5 region centered on the player. This block must be [[transparent]], with a solid block below and another transparent block above. If no such block can be found, the wolf does not teleport.

It is possible for tamed wolves to teleport to an inaccessible location (e.g. under [[ice]]) and be injured or die of [[suffocation]] as a result. This happens when the wolf considers [[transparent]] blocks, such as [[glass]] or [[Slab|slabs]], to be open.{{verify|Is this still happening or was this a bug that's fixed? Is this perhaps Java- or Bedrock-only?}}

Wolves cannot teleport across [[dimension]]s. As such, if the player is in another dimension than the wolf, it remains in its current dimension and automatically sits until the player allows it to stand. However, wolves can be transported to another dimension by pushing them into the portal first.

Tamed wolves do not teleport if:
* The wolf has been ordered to sit.
** Exception: The wolf is likely to teleport if it is injured while sitting (it no longer sits after teleporting). An example is if a wolf that is sitting is hit by another player, it teleports to their owner.
** Exception: If the wolf is in a loaded [[chunk]], and the player gets damaged by a mob, there's a chance for the wolf to stop sitting, causing them to teleport if the player is far away, then attack the player's attacker and sit down afterward.
* The wolf is angry, e.g. if it is chasing after a [[skeleton]]. This can lead to wolves standing and jumping in one place, such as over a cavern if a skeleton is near. The wolf teleports once the skeleton is killed.
* The wolf is in a [[minecart]] or a [[boat]].
* The wolf has been attached to a fence post with a lead.
* The wolf is in an unloaded [[chunk]], which can occur if the player moves away too quickly for the chunk to remain loaded (such as when flying with an elytra or travelling by boat on an ice highway).

Wolf teleportation is completely silent.<ref>{{bug|MC-166291||Certain forms of teleportation do not play the teleportation sound|Invalid}}</ref>

=== Taming, health, and feeding ===
[[File:Lots of tamed wolves.png|thumb|Many different types of wolves (tamed) sitting.]]
[[File:Begging-dogs.png|thumb|A group of begging wolves.]]

A wolf can be [[tamed]] by feeding it [[bone]]s. Once tamed, a wolf does not accept any more bones. The number of bones required is random: each bone has a {{frac|1|3}} chance of taming the wolf. If the wolf is tamed, it receives a red collar and, {{in|java}}, sits if not [[swimming]]. There is no limit to the number of wolves that a [[player]] can tame. A wolf cannot be tamed if it is [[hostile]] or already tamed. Wolves that are tamed by the same player can accidentally [[attack]] each other while attacking another mob, leading to a fight.{{verify|Entities don't use a hitscan to attack, so how is this possible?}}

{{Anchor|Health}}
A tamed wolf's tail rises and lowers depending on its [[health]]. The exact health of an individual wolf can be determined by measuring the angle between its hind legs and tail. The angle indicates the percentage of health that the wolf has. Tamed wolves whine when they have low health (below {{hp|20}}{{only|JE|short=1}} / {{hp|10}}{{only|BE|short=1}}). Untamed wolves have a maximum health of {{hp|8}}; the position of an untamed wolf's tail does not depend on its health. Tamed wolves, as well as untamed wolves {{in|Bedrock}}, can be healed by feeding them any of the meat and fish items listed below.

|}

Wolves do not get {{EffectLink|Hunger|hunger|link=Hunger (effect)}} from eating [[rotten flesh]] and [[raw chicken]], nor {{EffectLink|Poison|poison}} from eating [[Pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]]. Feeding any meat item to a tamed wolf that is already at full health starts the "[[Breeding|love mode]]" animation.

A tamed wolf's collar color can be changed by the owner {{control|using}} one of the sixteen colored [[dye]]s on the wolf.

Using a wolf spawn egg on a tamed wolf makes the baby automatically be tamed to the parent wolf's owner.

=== Wolf armor ===
[[File:Wolf wearing Wolf Armor.png|thumb|A pale wolf wearing wolf armor.]]
{{main|Wolf Armor}}

{{Control|Using}} wolf armor on a wolf that the player has [[tamed]] equips it onto the wolf.

Wolf armor absorbs all damage done to the wolf with some exceptions (see the list below), until its durability runs out. When the armor absorbs damage, the wolf does not produce a hurt noise.

Baby or untamed wolves cannot wear armor.

Wolf armor does not absorb damage dealt by the following sources:
* [[Drowning]]
* [[Freezing]]
* [[Suffocating]]
* [[Magic damage|Magic]]
* [[Thorns]]
* The [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] effect
* [[Void]]
* Being outside the [[world border]]
* [[Entity cramming]]
* The {{command|kill}} command
* [[Warden]]'s sonically-charged shriek

If the owner uses [[shears]] on a wolf that is wearing armor, the armor gets unequipped from the wolf.

If a wolf dies while equipped with wolf armor, the armor is dropped.

A wolf armor's durability is 64 Durability points. It can make a cracking sound in certain points. Damage particles appear as the armor goes down 60, 44, and 20 points.

Repairing wolf armor recovers 8 durability points per [[armadillo scute]]. When merged with another wolf armor via crafting table or anvil it also gives a 5% durability bonus.

=== Breeding ===
{{main|Breeding}}
[[File:Sitting pup.png|thumb|A baby pale wolf sitting.]]

Tamed wolves at full [[health]] can be bred with any type of meat, including rotten flesh and raw chicken without causing the hunger [[status effect]] (see the list above). {{IN|java}}, [[rabbit stew]] and any type of fish can also be used to breed wolves. There is a 5-minute cooldown in [[Java Edition]] and a 1-minute cooldown in [[Bedrock Edition]] for breeding, during which the wolf does not accept meat. In order to breed, both wolves must be standing.

Baby wolves have a 50% chance of being the same variant as either of its parents. Similar to a [[sheep]]'s wool color, the color of a baby wolf's collar is a mix of the colors of the parents' collars, if it is possible to mix them; otherwise, one of the parents' collars is randomly chosen.

Similarly, breeding two wolves with different sound variants or a single one will produce a baby with a randomized sound variant. When the baby appears, a soundclip from one random sound variant will play, but the other sounds the baby makes come from a different variant.

Baby wolves take 24000 ticks (20 minutes) to grow, but the growth time can be accelerated {{control|using}} any type of meat; {{in|java}}, rabbit stew and any type of fish can also be used. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.

Breeding two wolves that recognize someone else as an owner causes the baby to also be owned by the owner of the original two wolves. If two tamed wolves have different owners, the baby is randomly assigned to one of their two owners as its permanent owner.

{{IN|java}}, if an untamed wolf is fed any type of meat or fish, it enters love mode but doesn't look for a partner and cannot breed.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Wolf.png|thumb|width=165x165|A pale wolf ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult wild wolf to form a [[jockey]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Wolf|Wolves|Dog}}

== Trivia ==
* If a tamed wolf is named with a [[name tag]], its name is shown in the chat to the owner when killed.
* Despite being unused at the time, one of the two howling sounds can be heard in an official Mojang [[YouTube]] video.<ref>{{YouTube link|oM0efF8anO4|POV: YOU'RE A WOLF|Minecraft|July 27, 2023}}</ref> The other one is heard twice in {{AMCM}}.
* The different wolf variants were initially made just for fun, until they were deemed the perfect addition to the [[Armadillo|armadillos]] and [[Wolf Armor|wolf armor]].<ref>{{YouTube link|LNO89rgNYQQ|All About The Armored Paws Drop|Minecraft|April 21, 2024}}</ref>
* In the [[April Fools' Day jokes|April fools']] snapshot [[Java Edition 22w13oneBlockAtATime|22w13oneBlockAtATime]] naming a wolf "Mars" gives it a unique texture.
* In the April fools' snapshot [[23w13a_or_b]], naming a wolf "[[Brandon Pearce|kingbdogz]]" using a [[name tag]] causes the wolf to be given a crown.
* A wild baby wolf's head grows significantly when it becomes angry.
* The wolf sound variants were recorded from various peoples' dogs who works during development of [[Minecraft 1.21.6]].
* The big wolf's death sound is not the same as the real one, but has been edited to closely match zombie villager's first and third ambient and ravager's first death sounds, because the real one has not been occasionally recorded due to the bad occurrence in the audio files, so it was pitched differently in the same pitch as zombie villager's first and third ambient sounds, and ravager's third stunning sound.
* In [[singleplayer]], if the player punches a wild wolf and leaves its field of vision, it stares at the player and does not move at all. Going back into its range causes it to continue pursuing the player.
* If the player attacks a wolf, but then moves a large distance away (e.g. 70 blocks), the wolf still appears hostile, but exhibits neutral behavior.{{only|java}}
* If a player uses the {{cmd|effect}} command to give a tamed wolf [[Health Boost]] 255, [[Absorption]] 255 and [[Regeneration]] 255, the wolf's tail may begin spinning all the way around constantly, or just point directly up.{{info needed|Which one exactly, and in what circumstances?}}
* With wild, tame, and angry states, baby and adult states, 9 variants, whether it is [[Name Tag#Easter eggs|named "Dinnerbone"/"Grumm"]] or not, and specifically for tamed wolves sitting and standing states, 40 tail positions, 16 collar colors, whether it is wearing [[wolf armor]] and whether that armor is [[Dye#Dyeing armor|dyed]] or not, and 16,777,216 dyed wolf armor colors, there are 1,642,824,992,160 possible visually distinct wolves. Because dyeing armor is limited to about 5,439,691 colors {{in|be}} without the use of [[command]]s, 532,654,544,160 of those are obtainable through normal means.
* A few of the sounds from the puppy also come from the sad sound variant. They may have have been pitched slightly for babies, despite still having the same pitch as the original one, the actual sound variants for adults is not working, but they may solve the problem from various users until the full release.
