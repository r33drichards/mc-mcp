== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''UI'''
*Screen Safe Area Settings: Disables Horizontal and Vertical Screen Position sliders if the Safe area is set to 100%

*Long splash texts on the start screen will break into two lines to be more readable. 
*The invite button on the pause screen is moved up a bit and now has an icon.
*Scaled and moved the title logo to make room for the friends drawer button. 
*Added new loading tips for creative mode.

'''{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/34063162910093-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-70-22#:~:text=for%20creative%20mode.-,Player%20Permissions,-The%20Player%20Permissions|title=Player Permissions}}'''
*The Player Permissions screen has been upgraded to the new Ore UI, bringing a fresh look and a more intuitive and user friendly experience.

'''{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/34063162910093-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-70-22#:~:text=Friends%20Drawer%20Improvements|title=Friends Drawer Improvements}}'''
*Players can now also find the Friends Drawer in the Main Menu and Game Menu, in addition to the Play Screen, in the top right of the screen.

=== Technical ===
'''API'''
*Component {{cd|minecraft:fluidContainer}} has been renamed to {{cd|minecraft:fluid_container}} in V2.

'''Commands'''
*Moved the {{cd|place feature}} and {{cd|place featurerule}} subcommands out of the Upcoming Creator Features experiment.

'''Components'''
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:is_collidable}} component
**This component allows other mobs to have vertical and horizontal collisions with the component's owner.
***For a collision to occur, both mobs must have a {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} component.
***This component can only be used on mobs and enables collisions exclusively between mobs.
**Please note that this type of collision is unreliable for moving mobs.
***It is recommended to use this component only in scenarios where the mob remains stationary.
**Collidable behavior is closely related to stackable behavior.
***While the {{cd|minecraft:is_collidable}} component governs how other mobs interact with the component's owner, the {{cd|minecraft:is_stackable}} component describes how an entity interacts with others of its own kind.
*The {{cd|entity_sensor}} component now has two additional fields: 
**{{cd|y_offset}}, applies a vertical offset to the entity's position when calculating distances to other entities.
**{{cd|find_players_only}}, restricts the search to Players only, affecting all subsensors.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_axis_aligned}} component, that causes the entity's body to automatically rotate to align with the nearest cardinal direction based on its current facing direction.
**Combining this with the {{cd|minecraft:body_rotation_blocked}} component will cause the entity to align to the nearest cardinal direction and remain fixed in that orientation, regardless of future changes in its facing direction.

'''Entity Components'''
*Added {{cd|on_spawn}} trigger to {{cd|spawn_chance}} on {{cd|hit}} sub-component, triggered on the newly spawned entity with other set to the owning entity.
*Added {{cd|particle_item_name}} map to {{cd|particle_on_hit}} on {{cd|hit}} sub-component, maps an item name to an actor filter to determine what the name of the item used in the particle should be. Falls back to the name of the entity itself as before.

'''Goals'''
*{{cd|minecraft:behavior.float_wander}} AI goal will now restrict mobs to their home position if they have the {{cd|minecraft:home}} component.

'''Mobs'''
*Added maximum value of {{cd|100000000.0}} and minimum value of {{cd|-100000000.0}} to {{cd|minecraft:collision_box}} component.

'''Network Protocol'''
*Added {{cd|ActorFlags::COLLIDABLE}}.
*Added {{cd|ActorFlags::BODY_ROTATION_AXIS_ALIGNED}}.

'''Sounds'''
*Sound effects found in animations and animation controllers can now include an optional {{cd|locator}} field similar to particle effects allowing them to originate from the locator on the entity rather than the origin.
