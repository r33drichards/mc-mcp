'''1.15 Pre-release 4''' (known as '''1.15-pre4''' in the launcher) is the fourth pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.15]], released on December 3, 2019,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-15-pre-release-1?4|Minecraft 1.15 Pre-Release 4|December 3, 2019}}</ref> which fixes many issues relating to coordinate precision.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''Performance'''
* Performance improvements.

'''[[Wikipedia:Floating-point arithmetic|Floating-point]] precision'''
* The floating-point precision used for the location of where certain particles and entities appear was increased to 64-bit ([[wikipedia:Double-precision floating-point format|double-precision]]), from 32-bit ([[wikipedia:Single-precision floating-point format|single-precision]]).
** This fixes many issues regarding certain types of [[particles]] and [[entities]] not appearing at the right places when far away from the center of the world, especially beyond 16,777,216 (2<sup>24</sup>) blocks. The following list includes instances that are known and confirmed to be fixed:
*** [[Particle]]s
**** [[Fishing]] particles<ref>{{bug|MC-161991}}</ref>
**** [[Squid]] ink particles<ref>{{bug|MC-161994}}</ref>
**** [[End gateway]] particles<ref>{{bug|MC-161999}}</ref>
**** [[Conduit]] particles<ref>{{bug|MC-161993}}</ref>
**** Impact particles when entity has fallen from height on to block<ref name="thebigone">{{bug|MC-76810}}</ref>
**** Sweeping attack particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** Damage heart particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** Particles appearing when using the {{cmd|/particle}} command<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[Mycelium]] particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** Underwater particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[Nether portal]] particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[End portal]] particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[Brewing stand]] particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[Monster spawner]] particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[Barrier]] particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** [[Armor stand]] breaking particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
**** Suspended gravity affected block particles<ref name="thebigone"/>
*** [[Entities]]
**** Primed [[TNT]] entities.<ref>{{bug|MC-125638}}</ref> However, indirectly ignited TNT from other explosions is still affected.<ref>{{bug|MC-167047}}</ref>
*** [[Block entities]]
**** The floating book above placed [[enchanting table]]s is now correctly rotated towards the direction of where a nearby player is at high coordinates.<ref>{{bug|MC-161888}}</ref> However, there are still issues with the book not opening early enough.<ref>{{bug|MC-167044}}</ref>

* The versions in which these issues first appeared, as well as other fixes, can be seen at [[Java Edition distance effects#History]].

'''Textures'''
* The checkerboard background for unfilled sections on maps now has its own texture.
