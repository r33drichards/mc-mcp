A '''zombie villager''' is a variant of the [[zombie]] that can be cured into a normal [[villager]] using a [[golden apple]] while it is under the effect of [[Weakness]].

== Spawning ==
[[File:Zombie Villager with Enchanted Wep.png|thumb|A plains zombie villager with an enchanted iron [[sword]].]]
{{IN|je}}, when [[zombie]]s spawn during the normal cycle, there is a 5% chance that one of them will be replaced with a zombie villager. This chance increases to 20% in old growth pine taiga biomes.

{{IN|be}}, when zombies spawn during the normal cycle, there is a 5% chance that 2–4 of them will be replaced with zombie villagers.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Converting ===
Additionally, if any type of zombie kills a [[villager]], that villager has a chance of turning into a zombie villager depending on the game difficulty.

{| class="wikitable"
!Difficulty
!Chance
|-
|[[Difficulty#Easy|Easy]]
|0%
|-
|[[Difficulty#Normal|Normal]]
|50%
|-
|[[Difficulty#Hard|Hard]]
|100%
|}

In ''Java Edition'',  a converted zombie villager does not despawn if the player has traded with it at least once prior to its conversion, but unlike all other persistent mobs it still counts toward the hostile mob cap. If the zombie villager picks up any item however, it remains persistent but is excluded from the mob cap. {{IN|Bedrock}} all converted zombie villagers are persistent.

=== Abandoned villages ===
Zombie villagers may also spawn as part of [[Village|abandoned villages]] during world generation, the number of which depends on the buildings in that village, as some buildings generate zombie villagers inside and some do not. Like villagers, the zombie villagers’ biome outfits are based on the type of village. These zombie villagers are persistent and do not despawn.

=== Igloo basements ===
A zombie villager appears alongside a [[cleric]] villager in every [[igloo]] basement (a normal zombie villager in ''Bedrock Edition'' and a cleric zombie villager in ''Java Edition''), both locked in small cages behind [[iron bars]]. One of them transforms into a leatherworker, due to the workstation (a cauldron). The zombie villager is persistent and does not despawn.

=== Reinforcements ===
{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
{{main|Zombie#Reinforcements 2|title1=Zombie § Reinforcements}}
On Hard [[difficulty]], all zombie villagers have a 0-10% chance to spawn other zombie villagers as reinforcements when receiving [[damage]] while targeting an [[entity]]. Additionally, up to 5% of zombie villagers spawn as leaders, getting a 50-75% boost to that chance. 

== Variants ==

=== Baby zombies ===
Baby zombie villagers make up 5% of zombie villager spawns. They have big heads, unlike normal baby villagers {{in|java}}. They behave similarly to regular zombie villagers, with the following differences:
* They are 30% faster than normal [[zombie]]s, yet they have the same [[health]] as normal zombies. This makes baby zombie villagers more dangerous than their bigger counterparts.
* The noises they make are higher-pitched than adult zombie villager [[sound]] effects.
* {{IN|java}}, baby zombie villagers have a chance to spawn as a [[chicken jockey]].
* Baby zombie villagers turn into baby [[villager]]s, if cured. In [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']], their heads turn back to small baby villager heads.<ref>{{bug|MC-180893|||Invalid}}</ref>
* Worn [[armor]] shrinks to fit their body size.
* They are able to fit through 1×1 [[block]] gaps.
* They drop 12 [[experience]] when killed by the [[player]] instead of 5.
* Unlike other baby [[mob]]s but like undead baby mobs, they stay as babies indefinitely and never grow into "adult" zombie villagers.
* They have a decreased [[hitbox]] size.

Baby zombie villagers are spawned when a [[zombie]] kills a baby [[villager]], the chance of infection being the same as adult zombie villagers. Baby zombie villagers also spawn naturally, but the combined chance (5% villagers × 5% babies) is low at 0.25% (or 1 in 400 chance) of all newly spawned zombies.

==== Mounts ====
{{In development|be|3=26.0|section=1}}
{{IN|bedrock}}, 15% of naturally spawned baby zombie villagers can start riding a mob and become a [[jockey]] when it tries attacking. A jockey mob ridden by a baby zombie villager will adapt to the speed of its rider. When cured, the baby villager will dismount the mob. A baby zombie villager can ride:{{columns-list|* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s

=== Armed zombie villagers ===
{{Main|Geared mobs}}
Along with [[skeleton]]s and regular [[zombie]]s, some zombie villagers are capable of picking up dropped [[item]]s. These zombie villagers automatically pick up and hold any item that they come across (except [[jack o'lantern]]s{{only|java}}, [[mob head]]s and [[pumpkin]]s, as these are worn on their heads), and use any [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, or [[tool]]s picked up. If they encounter another similar item, they pick it up and drop their previous item:

* if the new [[item]] is [[armor]] or a sword and the old item was not (for example, zombie villagers prefer [[sword]]s to [[pickaxe]]s and [[helmet]]s to [[pumpkin]]s),
* if both items are armor/swords and the new item is better damage-wise (reduces more damage for armor, or inflicts more damage for swords),
* if both items are armor/swords with the same damage reduction/infliction, the new item has NBT tags while the old does not or the new item is ''more'' [[Item durability|damaged]] than the old item, or
* if both items are bows and the new item has NBT tags while the old does not.

[[Item]]s dropped by [[mob]]s in exchange for another cannot be picked up by [[player]]s or mobs for 10 game ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag), but can be picked up by [[hopper]]s.

[[Armor]] worn by zombie villagers is not damaged from most damage sources, which means it cannot "wear out" the way [[player]] armor does. [[Helmet]]s (not [[block]]s like [[pumpkin]]s) on zombie villagers can wear away and break if the zombie villager is exposed to daylight, or has an [[anvil]] or other falling block dropped on its head. Zombie villagers also have a natural armor rating of {{armor|2}}, which gives 1.6 - 8% damage reduction from [[Armor#Effects|most sources]].

Some zombie villagers that are capable of picking up [[item]]s spawn already in possession of such items, and those items may also be [[enchant]]ed. The chances of that event are listed below. If a zombie villager spawns wearing multiple pieces of [[armor]], the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material).

Any zombie villager that spawns with equipment{{only|java}} (picked-up items don't count) [[drop]]s 1–3 extra [[experience]] per [[item]].

=== Villager variants ===
A zombie villager retains its biome outfit and profession after zombification from a villager. They also retain their trades. Zombie villagers with a profession ''cannot'' work at a job site block.

Below is a table listing the various biome outfits and professions, along with the specific job site block that each [[Zombie Villager/Professions|profession]] requires:

{{/Professions}}

=== Variant spawning ===
A zombie villager has variants depending on what biome it had spawned in, a [[Plains]] variant spawning in [[Sunflower Plains]] is an example.

upcoming_be = {{upcoming|BE 26.0}}
}}
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping on death or when cured and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

=== Naturally-spawned equipment ===
Zombie villagers do not spawn with equipment in ''Bedrock Edition''. In ''Java Edition'', a zombie villager can spawn with any of the following:
* {{BlockLink|Carved Pumpkin}} <ref name=":0" group="note">Zombie villagers spawn with [[pumpkin]]s and [[jack o'lantern]]s{{Only|java}} only during [[Wikipedia:Halloween|Halloween]].</ref>
* {{BlockLink|Jack o'Lantern}}{{only|java}}<ref name=":0" group="note" />
* {{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Iron Sword}}
* {{ItemLink|Diamond Sword}} (in [[ominous trial]]s)
* {{ItemLink|Iron Chestplate|Random Armor|link=Armor}}
* Zombie villagers have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), and drop it with a random durability. Each level of [[Looting]] increases the chance by 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). They cannot drop the [[diamond sword]]s that they occasionally wield during ominous trials.

{{Notelist}}

=== Experience ===
Adult zombie villagers drop {{xp|5}} and an additional {{xp|1|3}} per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby zombie villagers drop {{xp|12}} experience.

== Behavior ==
{{main|Zombie#Behavior}}

Zombie villagers behave as ordinary [[zombie]]s, except that they do not convert to [[drowned]] when submerged.

Zombie villagers that were converted from [[villager]]s retain their professions and clothes, which gain a tattered appearance. Naturally spawned zombie villagers (or ones spawned with spawn eggs) have a random profession, and can also spawn with unemployed or [[nitwit]] outfits. {{IN|BE}}, baby zombie villagers are always unemployed.

{{IN|Java}}, zombie villagers are never spawned as part of a [[zombie siege]], but if a zombie villager naturally spawns nearby, it will join the siege and behave like all other zombies.

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* ignored by the [[wither]].
* affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* a threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

=== Curing ===
{{Redirect|Curing|the enchantment|Mending}}
{{relevant tutorial|Curing a zombie villager}}

Zombie villagers can be cured (converted to normal [[villager]]s) by first giving them the [[Weakness]] effect, which can be applied by:
* A [[splash potion]] of Weakness thrown by the [[player]], a [[dispenser]], or a [[witch]].
* A [[lingering potion]] of Weakness thrown by the player or a dispenser.
*An [[arrow of Weakness]] shot by the player, a dispenser, or a [[parched]].
*An [[area effect cloud]] caused by the explosion of a [[creeper]] inflicted with Weakness.{{only|java}}
*The {{cmd|effect}} command, if cheats are enabled.

The weakened zombie villager must then be healed by {{Control|using}} a (non-enchanted<ref>{{bug|MC-107909||Can't cure zombie villager with enchanted golden apple
|WAI}}</ref>) [[golden apple]] on it. The zombie villager begins to shudder to signal that curing is in progress. Also, the Weakness effect is removed, replaced by [[Strength]] for the duration of the curing process. An internal countdown timer is then started, counting down the total time to cure.

Time to cure is initially a random integer between 3600 and 6000 ticks (180 to 300 seconds, 3-5 minutes). On each tick, there is a 1% chance for the game to look for cure accelerants. It checks each block within a 9×9×9 cube centered on the villager for either [[iron bars]] or a [[bed]] (either half of a bed, detected separately; [[copper bars]] are ignored). For each one found up to 14, there is a 30% chance of decreasing the countdown timer by 1 more tick. Therefore, having at least 14 half-beds and/or iron bars within range speeds up conversion by an average of 4.2%.<ref>{{ytl|CYIAfv291k4}}</ref><!-- In 1.19.2, see code in ZombieVillager.getConversionProgress. -->

During the curing process, the zombie villager behaves like a normal zombie except that it gains [[Strength]] (with a potency that doesn't depend on the [[difficulty]] level). Thus, a zombie villager is more dangerous during curing than at other times.

At the end of the curing process, the zombie villager transforms into a [[villager]] and gains the [[Nausea]] effect for 10 seconds (which has no effect on the villager's behavior). If it was holding any item it picked up, that item is dropped (unless it was enchanted with [[Curse of Binding]], in which case it remains in the villager's inventory but is not worn and does not drop if the villager is killed). If it was a baby before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a baby after the cure. If it had traded with a player at least once, it recovers its former profession and inventory of trades. Otherwise, it recovers its profession but might immediately change it if it finds and claims a workstation block for a different profession.

A newly-cured villager, if it had a profession prior to being zombified, offers a trading discount to the player who administered the cure. These discounts are permanent. If a villager is cured more than once, no additional discounts are applied. Villagers near the cured villager are also affected but offer fewer, smaller discounts.

Zombie villagers that are in the process of converting do not despawn if the player moves far away from them, but like all monsters, they despawn if the [[difficulty]] is changed to Peaceful.

=== Specific to ''Java Edition'' ===
* If a zombie villager spawned as a nitwit or was a nitwit before it was transformed into a zombie villager, it remains a nitwit if cured.
* If cured, naturally spawned zombie villagers keep their profession for one tick then become unemployed.
* A cured villager gains both the permanent and the temporary but spreadable type of positive [[Villager#Gossiping|gossip]] from curing.
* There is a bug whereby if you cure a zombie villager chicken jockey, the baby [[villager]] will still ride the chicken. The rider will grow to a normal villager after 20 minutes and, if struck by lightning, can be turned into a [[witch]] jockey.

=== Specific to ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
*A former nitwit zombie villager becomes an unemployed villager and can learn a profession after the cure.
*Villagers in a range of 16 blocks in a cube surrounding the cured villager also offer a small discount proportional to the number of cured villagers (up to 10).
*Saving and reloading the world causes the curing process to finish as soon as the chunk containing the villager is ticked. This does not happen if the player moves out of range, then returns: In that case, the countdown timer pauses until the player returns.
* After the curing process, naturally spawned zombie villagers can gain a different profession from the one they had while zombified.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Zombie Butcher.png|thumb|width=165x165|A butcher zombie villager ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult zombie villager to form a [[jockey]].

== Trivia ==

* When a zombie villager wears a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]], its head is so tall that it pokes out the top of the pumpkin.<!--Applies to both Java and Bedrock; other than spawning with pumpkins during Halloween in Java, zombie villagers can pick up and wear carved pumpkins in both editions-->
* {{IN|java}}, zombie villagers have a glitched design when using the programmer art [[resource pack]].<ref>{{bug|MC-140954||Zombie villager fists render around the head while using Programmer Art texture pack}}</ref>
* {{IN|bedrock}}, when a zombie villager holds a [[trident]], the hand that holds the trident lowers.
* In ''Bedrock Edition'', if a zombie villager is summoned using the /summon command with an invalid spawn event, a generic zombie villager that moves extremely fast spawns.
* In ''Bedrock Edition'', the icon for the [[achievement]] Zombie Doctor uses the old zombie villager texture.
* Curing a zombie villager [[chicken jockey]] is the only way to get a villager riding a chicken without the use of [[commands]].<ref>{{bug|MC-200418||Cured baby zombie villagers stay as jockey variant}}</ref>{{Only|je}}
* Green-colored zombies are also present in ''[[Minicraft]]'', a 2D ''Minecraft''-inspired game also created by [[Markus Persson]].
* {{IN|java}}, the rarest mob is a baby zombie villager riding a chicken, with 3 pieces of enchanted diamond armor, an enchanted iron sword and a jack o' lantern on its head. It has approximately a 1 in 948 trillion (948,148,148,148,148) chance to spawn and can be found only during Halloween, as this is when mobs can spawn wearing jack o' lanterns.
