'''25w15a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.6]], released on April 8, 2025,<ref>{{snap|25w15a|id=a|April 8, 2025}}</ref> which adds the [[dried ghast]] block, [[happy ghast]]s, [[harness]]es, two new [[advancement]]s and fixes bugs. The [[locator bar]] is also added behind an [[experimental]] toggle.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Dried Ghast BE1.png;Partially Hydrated Ghast BE1.png;Mostly Hydrated Ghast BE1.png;Hydrated Ghast BE1.png|32px}} [[Dried ghast]]'''
* Found in [[Nether fossils]] in [[soul sand valley]]s.
* Can be crafted with 1 [[bone block]] and 8 [[ghast tear]]s.
{{Crafting
|A1 = Ghast Tear
|B1 = Ghast Tear
|C1 = Ghast Tear
|A2 = Ghast Tear
|B2 = Bone Block
|C2 = Ghast Tear
|A3 = Ghast Tear
|B3 = Ghast Tear
|C3 = Ghast Tear
|Output = Dried Ghast
|ignoreusage=1
}}
* Can be mined instantly without using a tool.
* When [[waterlogged]], it undergoes 3 states over about 20 minutes until it spawns a [[ghastling]] mob.
* Makes sounds and shows particles depending on state.
* If mined during the waterlogging, it will revert to its "dry" state regardless of what state it has reached during waterlogging.
** Will revert states back to its initial "dry" state when it is taken away from being waterlogged, using the same time scale.
* Can be moved by [[piston]]s.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Happy_Ghast_Spawn_Egg_JE1_BE1.png|32px]] [[Happy ghast spawn egg]]'''
* Used to spawn a [[happy ghast]].

'''{{animate|White Harness.png;Light Gray Harness.png;Gray Harness.png;Black Harness.png;Brown Harness.png;Red Harness.png;Orange Harness.png;Yellow Harness.png;Lime Harness.png;Green Harness.png;Cyan Harness.png;Light Blue Harness.png;Blue Harness.png;Purple Harness.png;Magenta Harness.png;Pink Harness.png|32px|class=pixel-image}} [[Harness]]'''
* Crafted out of 3 [[leather]], 2 [[glass]] and 1 [[wool]], the harness will have the same color as the wool used when crafting.
{{Crafting
|A1 = Leather
|B1 = Leather
|C1 = Leather
|A2 = Glass
|B2 = Matching Wool
|C2 = Glass
|Output = Matching Harness
|ignoreusage = 1
}}
* Used to fly on [[happy ghast]]s.
** Can only be equipped on a happy ghast.
** Allows up to 4 players to mount the happy ghast.
* Have 16 variants, matching the color of wool used to craft the harness.
** Can be re-dyed.
{{Crafting
|B2 = Any Harness
|C2 = Matching Dye
|Output = Matching Harness
|ignoreusage = 1
}}
* Can be removed from the happy ghast using [[shears]], but only when no players are mounted.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Ghastling (pre-release).gif|32px]] [[Ghastling]]'''
* Spawned after a [[dried ghast]] gets hydrated in [[water]].
** Can also be summoned using the command: {{cmd|/summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ {Age:-24000} }}, or by using a Happy Ghast Spawn Egg on a Happy Ghast.
* Has {{hp|20}} health points.
* Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes (or faster if fed Snowballs).
** Can be tempted and fed using [[snowball]]s to speed up their growth.
* After spawning, a ghastling will try and follow:
** Players within a 16-block radius.
** Or an adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius.
* If no player or suitable mob is close around the ghastling, it will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with).
** It will reset its home position if it is moved more than 16 blocks away from the border of its home area.

'''[[File:Happy Ghast.gif|32px]] [[Happy ghast]]'''
* Spawned after a [[ghastling]] grows up.
* Has {{hp|20}} [[health points]].
* A rideable entity, which can be equipped with a [[harness]] and ridden by up to four players.
** When a player mounts, the goggles on the happy ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it now can be controlled.
** Players mounted after the first player piloting the happy ghast are placed in slots on each side of it, starting clockwise from the first player.
** Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top.
** 3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted.
** If players dismount midair, the happy ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming.
* The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting in front of the Happy Ghast, just above its face.
** Pressing the forward key will make the Happy Ghast fly in the direction the player is looking.
** Pressing the back key will make the Happy Ghast fly in the opposite direction the player is looking.
** Pressing the left and right keys will strafe the Happy Ghast in the respective direction.
** Pressing the jump key will make the Happy Ghast fly directly up.
* Can be stood on, similar to a [[shulker]].
** If the happy ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction.
*** This happens regardless of it having a harness equipped or not.
* When not being ridden, can be tempted by players holding [[snowball]]s and [[harness|harnesses]].
** However, they can not be bred.
** Harness tempting only works if the Happy Ghast is unharnessed.
* Has no panic behavior when taking damage.
* Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered.
* Can be burned by [[fire]] and [[lava]], as opposed to regular [[ghast]]s.
* Cannot enter [[boats]], but can enter [[minecart]]s.
* When there are no players mounted or walking on the happy ghast, the goggles go up and the happy ghast starts to roam around the home position (the home position is where the Ghastling was hydrated as a dried ghast).
* Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position in the similar way as the [[Ghastling]].
** If wearing a harness, the happy ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks).
** The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own.
* Does not drop anything other than [[experience]].
