=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Added a new death message for when players or their pets are defeated by a [[mace]] smash attack.
** '''<''player/mob''> was smashed by <''player''>'''
** '''<''player/mob''> was smashed by <''player''> with <''item''>'''

'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Water splash sounds have been adapted to the {{JE}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Rarity]]'''
*The rarity of all items and blocks in the game has been re-evaluated to more accurately reflect the current challenge of obtaining them, given the following guidelines:
**Items and blocks become rarer depending on the following factors:
***The chance of finding it in a loot table, including mob drops.
***The amount of traveling required to obtain it.
***The difficulty of any obstacle that must be overcome to obtain it.
***The possible amount of that item or block that exists in the world.
**Any item or block that can be crafted must inherit the highest rarity of its crafting ingredients.
***For example, a Mace has an Epic rarity because one of its ingredients (the Heavy Core) has an Epic rarity.
***Likewise, any crafted item that has only Common crafting ingredients must also be Common.
**The lists below detail the items and blocks that have changed to that rarity category.

**If the base rarity of an item is Epic, it remains Epic when enchanted.

'''[[Realms]]'''
*The Realms backup list now displays the date that the backup was created, instead of the age of the backup.

'''Touch Controls'''
*Improved new d-pad for touch controls. It is now more compact, includes back strafing buttons, and a slightly extended zone outside where camera input is not received in order to prevent unexpected camera movement. When customizing controls, the diagonal buttons are visible as well.

***A value of 0 means that this item is not allowed inside another storage item.
**The {{cd|banned_items}} field defines the items that are not allowed in the item's dynamic container.
**The {{cd|allowed_items}} field defines the items that are exclusively allowed in the item's dynamic container.
***If empty all items are allowed in the item's dynamic container.
*Added {{cd|minecraft:bundle_interaction}} item component to enable bundle-specific interaction scheme and tooltip.
**This component requires that the bundles toggle is enabled.
**To use this component the item must have a {{cd|minecraft:storage_item}} component defined.
**The {{cd|minecraft:bundle_interaction}} component interacts with the container created by the {{cd|minecraft:storage_item}} component.
**The {{cd|num_viewable_slots}} field (1 to 64) defines the maximum number of item stacks accessible from the top of the bundle, while other slots are hidden.

'''[[Resource Pack|Resource]] and [[Behavior Pack]]s'''
*The player's {{cd|helmet_layer_visible}} variable is now based on the result of the {{cd|has_head_gear}} [[Molang]] query and the player and persona render controller's part visibility for the helmet layer no longer checks for the existence of head gear. 
**This fixes attachable scripts setting the {{cd|helmet_layer_visible}} to 1.0 to now properly work and maintains a fix that prevents persona hair and head gear from clipping outside of mob and [[Pumpkin]] heads.

'''[[Trading|Trade Tables]]'''
*The Trade Table files are now versioned:
**TradeTier's {{cd|total_exp_required}} is a required member from version {{cd|1.21.30}}.
**TradeTier's {{cd|groups}} is a required member from version {{cd|1.21.30}}.
**TradeItem's quantity {{cd|min}} cannot be lower than {{cd|max}} from version {{cd|1.21.30}}.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", "Bundles", and "Upcoming Creator Features" experimental toggles.
=== Additions ===
==== Items ====
'''[[File:Bundle Filled BE1.png|32px]] [[Bundle]]s'''
* Added bundles.
* A bundle is an item that can pack different items together into the same stack.
* A bundle fits one stack (usually 64 items) but it can be a mixture of many different item types.
* Player can insert items into a bundle directly in the [[inventory]].
* The bundle tooltip fits 3 rows and can always show at least 8 item types.
* Player can select any of the visible items to pull out of the bundle:
** Use the scroll wheel on mouse, the right stick on a game controller, or tap on a touch device.
* When selecting an item to remove, the bundle icon shows that item poking out of the bundle.
* When holding a bundle in hand, player can empty it onto the ground.
* The bundle is crafted with one string above one leather:
{{Crafting
|B1=String
|B2=Leather
|Output=Bundle
|ignoreusage=1
}}

==== Technical ====
'''Add-Ons and Script Engine'''
*Added {{cd|item_display_transforms}} control to the block geometry file. This controls the way a block is visually represented in the UI, on the player, and floating on the ground. It exists inside the {{cd|minecraft:geometry}} json object and requires geometry {{cd|format_version}} 1.21.0 and the "Upcoming Creator Features" toggle
**Default values example:
 "item_display_transforms": { "gui" : { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [30, 225, 0], "scale": [0.625, 0.625, 0.625], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "fit_to_frame" : true }, "firstperson_righthand": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 45, 0], "scale": [0.4, 0.4, 0.4], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "firstperson_lefthand": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, -135, 0], "scale": [0.4, 0.4, 0.4], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "thirdperson_righthand": { "translation": [0, 2.5, 0], "rotation": [75, 45, 0], "scale": [0.375, 0.375, 0.375], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "thirdperson_lefthand": { "translation": [0, 2.5, 0], "rotation": [75, 45, 0], "scale": [0.375, 0.375, 0.375], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "ground": { "translation": [0, 3.0, 0], "rotation": [0, 0, 0], "scale": [0.25, 0.25, 0.25], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "fixed": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 0, 0], "scale": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] }, "head": { "translation": [0, 0, 0], "rotation": [0, 0, 0], "scale": [1, 1, 1], "rotation_pivot" : [0, 0, 0], "scale_pivot" : [0, 0, 0] } }

'''API'''
*{{cd|PlayerInteractWithBlockBeforeEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value is true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false if triggered on holding the interaction button.
*{{cd|PlayerInteractWithBlockAfterEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|beforeItemStack?: ItemStack}} to {{cd|beta}}. This is the item the player was selecting before the interaction succeeded.
**Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value is true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false if triggered on holding the interaction button.
**This after event no longer always triggers on an empty hand. The interaction with the block needs to be successful for it to trigger the after event.
*{{cd|PlayerInteractWithEntityAfterEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|beforeItemStack?: ItemStack}} to {{cd|beta}}. This is the item the player was selecting before the interaction succeeded.
**Canceling the before event now no longer triggers the after event.
**This event now triggers only on a successful interaction.
*{{cd|ItemUseOnBeforeEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value is true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false on events triggered from holding the interaction button.
*{{cd|ItemUseOnAfterEvent}}
**Added property readonly {{cd|isFirstEvent: boolean}} to {{cd|beta}}. This value is true if the event was triggered on players initial interaction button press and false on events triggered from holding the interaction button.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Added new experimental field {{cd|item_specific_speeds}} to {{cd|minecraft:destructible_by_mining}} block component.

'''Gameplay'''
*Focus Target Camera: Added {{cd|rotation_speed}} in the free camera preset JSON to control the speed of rotation for targeting an entity. This value is a float that represents degrees turned per second.
*Focus Target Camera: Added {{cd|snap_to_target}} bool in the free camera preset JSON to enable snapping to the target entity on the first tick.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''[[API]]'''
*Moved class {{cd|PlayerCursorInventoryComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|1.14.0}}.
