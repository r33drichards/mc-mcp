A '''cactus flower''' is a type of [[flower]] that grows from [[cactus|cacti]]. It can be placed on any solid top surface or [[Crafting|crafted]] into [[Pink Dye|pink dye]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cactus flowers [[Breaking|break]] instantly when mined by hand or any item. A cactus flower will always drop itself when mined by a [[player]].{{breaking row|Cactus Flower|horizontal=1}}
When a cactus flower's supporting block is removed, the cactus flower uproots and drops as an [[item (entity)|item]].

A cactus flower also removes and drops itself as an item if a [[piston]] tries to push it, or moves a block into its space. Trying to pull it with a sticky piston does nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Cactus flowers can generate in [[desert]]s, [[badland]]s, [[Eroded Badlands|eroded badlands]] and [[Wooded Badlands|wooded badlands]] growing on [[cactus]] blocks. Naturally generated cacti have a 25% chance to have a cactus flower on top.

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post generation ===
A cactus flower has a chance of growing on [[cactus]] blocks. If a [[cactus]] is one or two blocks high the flower has a 10% chance to grow instead of the cactus getting higher. If a cactus is three blocks high the flower has a 25% chance to grow. A cactus flower can only grow if there are no blocks in any cardinal directly adjacent to it. A cactus with a cactus flower can no longer grow.

=== Automatic harvesting ===
The optimal harvest interval for automatic cactus flower farms not relying on block detection is 34 minutes and 6.45 seconds.<!-- Rebuking "no source". Here is the formula for the doubters.

Each block has p = 1−(4095/4096)³ chance per tick of a random-tick. Model N~Poisson(λ=T·p). Yield Y(λ)=0.1·P(9≤N≤24)+0.325·P(N≥25). Maximize blocks-per-tick by solving λ·Y′(λ)=Y(λ) → λ≈29.96, giving T* = λ/p ≈ 40929 ticks (~34 min 6.45 s). -->

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Cactus flowers can be placed on [[cactus]] blocks, [[farmland]], or any block which provides center support at the top of the block. A placed cactus flower might be used as a decorative block. Cactus flowers cannot be placed in [[flower pot]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-280104||Cactus flower cannot be placed in a flower pot|Invalid}}</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Feeding ===
[[Bees]] follow players holding a cactus flower in their hand within 6 blocks. [[Feeding]] a cactus flower to an adult bee causes it to enter [[Breeding|love mode]]. Two adult bees in love mode will always breed and produce offspring. When fed to a baby bee, it will slightly speed up its growth into an adult bee.

=== Composting ===
Using cactus flowers on a [[composter]] has a 30% chance to raise the compost level by 1. A stack of cactus flowers yields an average of 2.74 [[bone meal]].

=== Pollination ===
A bee might try to pollinate a cactus flower and collect pollen from it, resulting in the production of either [[Honey Bottle|honey]] or [[Honeycomb|honeycombs]] at its [[Bee Nest|bee nest]]. Bees might die this way due to the cactus that often accompanies a cactus flower, which might prick some bees to death during pollination, unless the cactus flower was manually placed by the player on a surface other than cactus.
