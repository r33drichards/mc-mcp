== Trivia ==
* In Latin, "rubedo" means "redness", and is defined as the final stage of transmutation in alchemy. A common goal in alchemy was to convert base metals into gold, leading to gold being associated with the color red and signaling success.
** In relation to ''Minecraft'', this may be a loose reference to the importance of gold as a material in the Nether, as well as the [[Nether wastes]] biome, which it plays in, being predominantly red.
