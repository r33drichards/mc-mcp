The '''Buffet''' [[world type]] used to have two extra generator types which were removed in [[Java Edition 1.18]] due to bugs and lack of support. They were:

* '''Caves:''' Uses generation settings that are similar to those of [[Nether]] in Overworld. The world generates with a bedrock floor at the Y=0 lower height limit and a bedrock ceiling at Y=127, and the world is generated in between these two like a giant cave complex, much like the Nether. Like other Buffet world types, this world type makes Overworld only have one selected biome.
* '''Floating Islands:''' Uses generation settings that are similar to those of [[End]] outer islands in Overworld. There is no bedrock ceiling or floor to the world, and the entire Overworld is generated in the shape of a series of floating islands, much like the End outer islands. Like other Buffet world types, this world type makes Overworld only have one selected biome.

== Trivia ==
* If used with Floating Islands world type, biomes that would normally contain underground generated structures, such as [[mineshaft]]s, [[stronghold]]s or [[fossil]]s, sometimes have the structures spawn floating freely away from the islands.
* Generating an Overworld biome with Floating Islands world type can simulate what the [[Sky Dimension]] or Indev map type floating might have looked like.
* Ocean biomes created using Floating Islands generation spawn with lots of floating water in the shape of [[cave]]s.
* Deep Ocean biomes created using Floating Islands generation can spawn the player into empty space and immediately drop them into the void, making such worlds unplayable in Survival.
* Depending on the biome, the bedrock ceiling of the Caves world type may have holes in it, due to the generation of [[lake]]s or other structures. Players who manage to make their way above the bedrock ceiling can find generated structures such as [[Villages]] and [[Ruined Portals]].
* The Caves world type is nearly uninhabitable, because in addition to the perpetual darkness causing hostile mobs to spawn continuously in normal Overworld biomes, trees never spawn regardless of biome, and therefore wood is obtainable only from structures that generate with it.
* If used with Floating Islands world generation, diamond and redstone ores are extremely hard to spawn as few islands reach down as far as Y=15{{verify|Is this really the lowest level?}}, the topmost level at which these ores spawn.
