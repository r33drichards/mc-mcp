{{relevant tutorial|Defeating the wither}}</div>
The '''wither''' is an [[undead]] [[boss]] mob spawned by building a specific structure using [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]] and three [[wither skeleton skulls]]. It is able to fly, fires explosive skulls at [[player]]s and most non-undead mobs and becomes immune to [[projectile]]s below half health. It is the only source of [[Nether star]]s, which are used to craft [[beacon]]s.

== Spawning ==
{{FakeImage|align=left|{{BlockGrid|scale=2|w=Wither Skeleton Skull|s=Soul Sand|www|sss| s }}|Wither build configuration. [[Soul soil]] can be used interchangeably with [[soul sand]].|style=max-width:106px}}
The wither is spawned by placing 4 blocks of [[soul sand]] and/or [[soul soil]] in a T shape, and putting 3 [[wither skeleton skull]]s on top of the three upper blocks. The last block placed must be one of the skulls (which can either be placed by hand or by a [[dispenser]]) then it will load a boss bar that takes 12 seconds to fully charge up, this then is followed by a large explosion. [[Air]] blocks are required on either side of the base soul sand/-soil. The orientation of the skulls does not matter, and the structure as a whole can be built upright, lying down, or upside-down. The wither spawns at the base soul sand/soil.
{{-|left}}

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
On death, the wither always drops a [[Nether star]]. It drops {{xp|50}} XP when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]].
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Nether Star}}
}}
A Nether star, when dropped by a wither:
* takes 10 minutes (as opposed to 5 minutes normally) to [[Item#Behavior|despawn]] {{in|java}}<ref>{{bug|MC-125027||Nether stars despawn after 10 minutes.|WAI}}</ref>
* never [[Item#behavior|despawn]]s {{in|bedrock}}

== Behavior ==

=== Spawning ===
[[File:Blue Wither 2.png|thumb|Wither when spawned with its blue shield.]]
When spawned, the wither switches colors between black and blue as its health bar fills up. While in this state, the wither is invulnerable and neither moves nor attacks. When this state ends after 11 seconds or 220 game ticks, the wither creates a large [[explosion]] centered on itself, destroying nearby blocks and dealing tons of damage to nearby players and other [[entities]]. 

It is the largest individual explosion that the player can cause {{in|java}} without commands, with a blast power of 7, more than that of a [[charged creeper]] or an [[end crystal]]. It is accompanied by a [[Sound#Gameplay|global sound event]] (a sound that is played for everyone, no matter how far away they are from the wither{{only|java|short=1}} <ref name="MC-177741">{{bug|MC-177741||Wither sounds play for all players}}</ref>). After this, the wither attacks nearby mobs and can take damage.

=== Health and damage ===
[[File:HealthBarComparison.png|thumb|right|The color difference between the [[ender dragon]]'s boss bar and that of the wither.]]
{{IN|Java}}, the wither's health is {{hp|300}}, regardless of [[difficulty]]. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, wither's health depends on difficulty:
* {{hp|300}} on Easy 
* {{hp|450}} on Normal 
* {{hp|600}} on Hard 

The wither is immune to [[fire]], [[lava]], [[drowning]], and [[freezing]]. Like other [[undead]] mobs, the wither is harmed by the [[Instant Health]] effect and healed by the [[Instant Damage]] effect as well as affected by weapons with the [[Smite]] enchantment. It is immune to all other [[status effect]]s, and cannot be damaged by other undead mobs.

Upon taking damage, the wither breaks all [[block]]s within a 3×4×3 area around it, including blast-resistant blocks like [[obsidian]], [[crying obsidian]], and [[ancient debris]], dropping them as [[item (entity)|items]] if possible. The wither is the only mob in the game that can destroy obsidian. (See [[Tutorial:Obsidian farming]])

The wither cannot break the following blocks: 
* {{BlockLink|Allow}}{{only|be|ee|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|Barrier}}
* {{BlockLink|Bedrock}}
* {{BlockLink|Border}}{{only|be|ee|short=1}}
* {{BlockSprite|chain-command-block}} {{BlockSprite|command-block}} {{BlockSprite|repeating-command-block}} [[Command Blocks]]
* {{BlockLink|Deny}}{{only|be|ee|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|End Gateway|link=End Gateway (block)}}{{only|je|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|End Portal|link=End Portal (block)}}
* {{BlockLink|End Portal Frame}}
* {{BlockLink|Jigsaw Block}}{{only|je|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|Light|Light Blocks}}
* {{BlockLink|Moving Piston}}
* {{BlockLink|Nether Portal}}{{only|je|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|Reinforced Deepslate}}
* {{BlockLink|Structure Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Structure Void}}{{only|be|ee|short=1}}
* {{BlockSprite|Test Block Start}}{{BlockSprite|Test Block Log}}{{BlockSprite|Test Block Accept}}{{BlockSprite|Test Block Fail}}[[Test block|Test Block]]{{only|je|short=1}}
* {{BlockLink|Test Instance Block}}{{only|je|short=1}}
{{IN|java}}, these blocks are listed under the {{cd|wither_immune}} [[tag]]. [[File:WitherAttack 2.png|thumb|right|alt=|The wither attacking a [[villager]].]]

The wither's block-breaking behavior makes [[suffocation]] ineffective under most circumstances. However, the blocks listed above, as well as some natural structures that include them (like the [[exit portal]]), can be used to suffocate the wither due to their wither immunity.

The wither is hostile toward all [[mob]]s except:

*{{EntityLink|Ghast|Ghasts}}<ref>{{bug|MC-162557||Withers no longer attack ghasts|WAI}}</ref>

**{{EntitySprite|drowned}} {{EntitySprite|husk}} {{EntitySprite|zombie}} {{EntitySprite|zombie-villager}} [[Zombie]]s and their variants
*Mobs with the {{cd|Invulnerable}} [[NBT tag]].

[[Armadillo]]s are afraid of withers (and other [[undead]] mobs) and hide in their shell if a wither is nearby.

If the wither is idle, it simply hovers and is unable to gain altitude. On Normal or Hard [[difficulty]], it fires blue skulls in random directions until it finds a target.

The color of the wither's [[bossbar]] depends on the edition: dark purple {{in|Java}} or light purple {{in|Bedrock}}. It appears whenever a [[player]] is within the vicinity of a wither. All withers display a boss bar on the screen, with a limit of five boss bars. A [[name tag|renamed]] wither displays its changed name above its boss bar. The [[fog]] around a player darkens when a wither is loaded.

Additionally, the wither's side heads shoot targets slightly slower than the main head. The interval for smaller heads is 2&ndash;3 seconds, while the main head's always 2.{{info needed|Which part of the article does this go in? And is it the same in both editions?}}

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
[[File:Wither with wither armor effect.gif|thumb|200x200px|Wither with 'wither armor' effect, after half health depleted.]]
;Attacking
Upon noticing a [[mob]] or a [[player]] within 40 blocks, the wither hovers above it and rapidly shoots black [[#Wither Skull|wither skull]]s. The wither always tries to fly 5 blocks above, and within 3 blocks horizontally from its target. Each head fires independently, allowing a wither to attack up to three different mobs/players at the same time. The wither skulls try to fly toward the middle of the target's eye height and its feet vertically and the middle of its hitbox horizontally.

The main head controls the wither's movement and fires a black wither skull toward its target every 2 seconds, with a 0.1% chance to shoot a blue wither skull instead of the default black one. When the line of sight to its target is blocked, the wither stops firing wither skulls but still [[Pathfinding|pathfinds]] toward the target. Side heads find a new target and fire black wither skulls toward the new target.

The wither skulls from the main head spawn 3 blocks above its body vertically and the middle of its hitbox horizontally. The wither skulls from the side heads spawn 2.2 blocks above its feet vertically, 1.3 blocks offset from the middle of its hitbox horizontally.

;Wither roses
When a wither kills another mob, a [[wither rose]] is planted if the ground is [[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[moss block]], [[mud]], [[netherrack]], [[soul sand]], or [[soul soil]], or otherwise dropped as an item at that mob's location; however, it may be destroyed by other wither skulls. Wither roses are planted/dropped even when the [[game rule]] {{cd|doMobLoot}} is set to {{cd|false}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-154922}}</ref>

The wither has a passive regeneration rate of {{hp|1}} every 20 ticks (1 second), and a direct killing blow on a target instantly heals {{hp|5}}.

;Wither armor
When its health drops below half ({{hp|150}}), the wither gains a natural "wither armor" effect, which makes it immune to [[damage]] from [[arrow]]s and thrown [[trident]]s and causes it to fly at the same height as the target. The armor disappears if it regenerates above half health.

Despite being immune to projectiles when it has "wither armor", it can still be hit by a [[warden]]'s sonic boom attack because it is not a projectile, but an instant damage attack. It can also still be hit by explosive fireworks, shot with or without a crossbow.

;Breaking blocks
When being damaged, the wither destroys a 3×4×3 area, with the lowest center block being the block where the wither's tail is located. The block where the wither tail is located is the block at the bottom center of the wither's hitbox (block position of the wither's coordinate).

The attack can destroy any block in the game except moving piston/blocks, unbreakable blocks, and liquids. Withers can do block breaking attacks every 20 [[tick]]s.

When a wither is damaged, it sets its block breaking counter to 20. Every time it gets processed, it first decreases the counter by 1, then check if the counter equals 0. If it is 0 after the decrement, it breaks the blocks around it.

Suffocation is processed before the block breaking, so if wither is suffocated or damaged by something else before it ticks, it breaks blocks 19 ticks after the damage instead of 20 ticks.

==== Side heads behavior ====
When one of the wither's side heads does not have a target, it locks onto a target randomly within line of sight and attempts to shoot a skull. Each head can lock onto different targets. When it has a target, it fires a black wither skull toward the target every 2–3 seconds. If the side head fails to fire a skull for 9.5–17.2 seconds, or the wither is damaged faster than 12 tick intervals, it fires a blue skull at a random direction. Each head has its own separate wither skull cooldowns. If reloaded, the side heads could possibly shoot at 7.5–17.2 seconds after reloading instead.

Every tick the wither gets processed:

# It decreases its side head wither skull cooldown by 1
# The game then checks through each side heads for the wither skull cooldown, if the wither skull cooldown equals to 0 after the decrement, it does the followings:
## Set the wither skull cooldown to 10 ~ 19
## Add 1 to blue wither skull counter
## If the blue wither skull counter is greater than 15 after the addition and the game difficulty is set to Normal or Hard:
### Shoots a blue wither skull in random direction
### Set blue wither skull counter to 0
## If the head has a target, it does the followings:
### Shoot a black wither skull toward the target
### Sets wither skull cooldown to 40 ~ 59
### Set blue wither skull counter to 0
## If it does not have a target, target a random target with line of sight

=== ''Bedrock Edition'' ===
The wither has different [[Mob spawning|spawn]] and death animations, both of which involve the wither exploding. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the eyes and mouths of both the wither and its skulls are emissive, and during spawning, shooting, or explosions the blue texture is emissive. The charge overlay below half health is also emissive. 

;Attacking
Upon noticing a [[player]] or [[mob]], the wither flies to a random location horizontally near the target, sometimes strafing a few blocks before settling, then hovers in place. It always attempts to be above the player's reaching distance (about 4 blocks). It shoots 3 black wither skulls and one blue wither skull before flying to another location. The time between each shot decreases when the wither reaches {{Hp|500}} and {{Hp|400}}. At half health it fires skulls at the original rate, then once again shoots faster at {{Hp|200}} and {{Hp|100}}.  On Normal [[difficulty]] or higher, if the wither has targeted an entity but cannot find a location to pathfind to, it shoots random blue skulls in a random direction along with the skulls directed toward the target.

A blue wither skull can be deflected by hitting it or using a projectile. If a deflected blue wither skull hits the wither, the wither takes damage.

;Half health behavior
At half health, it crashes into the ground causing a large [[explosion]] that spawns 3 [[wither skeleton]]s (except on Easy difficulty), as well as gaining wither armor. It then sometimes dashes into the ground destroying all the blocks around it, until it goes down approximately 40 blocks or reaches a block it cannot break.

Instead of flying to a random location, the wither moves by dashing toward its target, destroying blocks and damaging players or mobs in its path. When dashing, the wither pauses and tilts its body completely horizontal before moving at a high speed. It continues firing wither skulls like before, dashing after every second volley.

The wither's dash ability breaks all blocks in a 6x8x6 volume around it, rounded to the south-east if required. Despite the wither being able to destroy [[obsidian]] with blue skulls, the wither cannot dash through it.

A wither retains its anti-projectile armor after regenerating over 1/2 of its total HP, though it disappears after the game is restarted.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-161643}} – After healing a wither boss over 1/2 HP, it still retains its anti-projectile shield</ref>

;Wither roses
Wither roses always drop as an item when the wither kills a mob. Wither roses are dropped even when the [[game rule]] {{cd|doMobLoot}} is set to {{cd|false}}.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-73842}}</ref> The [[wither rose]] inflicts the [[Wither effect]] for a couple of seconds when stepped on.

;Easy difficulty
On Easy difficulty, the wither does not inflict the wither effect or summon wither skeletons.

}}

When attacking, the wither rapidly fires explosive projectiles called wither skulls, which look similar to its own heads, at its target. There are two types of wither skulls: a fast-moving black one, and a slower blue one.
*Black wither skulls explode with a blast power of 1, the same as a [[ghast]]'s fireball, and cannot break blocks with a [[blast resistance]] above 4.
*Blue wither skulls have the same explosion strength, but move slower and are more destructive to terrain. They treat all breakable blocks as having a blast resistance lower than 0.8 (except [[reinforced deepslate]]), such as [[obsidian]], [[ancient debris]] and [[blocks of netherite]]. Blue skulls are able to destroy [[water]] and [[lava]] source blocks, but cannot break unbreakable blocks like [[bedrock]] and [[end portal frame]]s. {{IN|education}}, blue wither skulls deal increased damage, but with the same explosion radius.

If either type of wither skull hits a player or mob, it does {{hp|8}} damage on Normal difficulty. It also inflicts [[Wither (effect)|Wither]] II for 10 seconds on Normal difficulty and 40 seconds on Hard, which turns the player's hearts black <span class="nowrap">({{healthbar|20|9px|withered=1}})</span> and drains health, similarly to [[Poison]]. However, unlike Poison, it can kill the player.

Like other [[status effects]], the Wither effect can be cured by drinking [[milk]].

{{IN|be}} and {{LCE}}, the blue skull can be deflected by hitting it with an empty hand, weapon, tool, throwable projectiles such as tridents, arrows, [[snowball]]s, and throwable potions and explosions. Deflected blue skulls can damage the wither if it hits the body, but not the heads. Killing a wither with a blue skull drops a wither rose as it is considered to be killed by a wither.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Wither (painting texture) JE1 BE1.png|thumb|160px|The painting depicting how to spawn a wither]]
*The wither was originally supposed to shoot flaming skulls, but the game would not stop crashing despite the best efforts of the developers. So, the skulls were changed to no longer be on fire.<ref>{{mcnet|minecrafts-top-10-bugs|Minecraft's Top 10 Bugs|August 16, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>
*According to [[Jeb]], the wither was inspired by ''[https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria Terraria]'', which has a summonable boss mechanic. The name itself is inspired by a poison spell in another game made by Jeb called ''Whispers in Akarra''.<ref>{{mcnet|meet-wither|Meet the Wither|February 13, 2017|Marsh Davies}}</ref>
*There is a [[painting]] showing the [[soul sand]] and [[wither skeleton skull]] formation needed to spawn a wither.
**Similarly, the wither appears on the four sides of [[chiseled red sandstone]].
*If the wither is damaged by the void, it frantically attempts to fire blue skulls.
*Above half health, the wither always attempts to stay a few blocks above the mob it is targeting. This means that attempting to build or climb up to hit the wither using a sword is essentially impossible.
**If the wither is after a blaze and the blaze tries to fly up to it, the wither attempts to keep rising above the blaze, thus making both of them rise higher until they hit a ceiling or until the [[blaze]] despawns or dies.
*Although the wither is 3.5 blocks tall, 3 blocks wide, and 1 block thick, its hitbox is only 3.5 blocks tall, 1 block wide, and 1 block thick. 
**The true dimensions of the wither are: 2.844 blocks tall (varies), 3 blocks wide, and 1.719 blocks long (also varies).
*An enemy called the [[wither storm]] appears in {{MCSM}}. It was created by replacing the center block of soul sand with a [[command block]].
*Despite not having visible feet, withers can make footstep sounds.<ref>{{bug|MC-92623}}</ref>
*In [[Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34]], withers drop red keys.
*According to [[Quinn Richter]], Marketplace Partner Manager, the wither's name is "Simmons?", similar to the ender dragon's name being "Jean?".<ref>{{ytl|gtL_hkE_LVE|Ask Mojang #4: To The Moon! @ 3:40|Minecraft|November 8, 2019|t=220}}</ref>
*On the webpage for the 10th anniversary of Minecraft, an image of the wither is referred to internally as a ghast.<ref name=":Ghast">{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/10th-anniversary|title=Celebrate with Us|website=minecraft.net}}</ref>
