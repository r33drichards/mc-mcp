The '''desert lakes''' or '''desert mutated''' were a rare variant of [[desert]]s that no longer generate since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and were removed in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
The desert lakes featured slightly rougher and hillier terrain than the base desert biome, though not as much as the [[desert hills]]. This made them more likely to have oases of [[water]] across its landscape. These lakes were often surrounded by large amounts of [[sugar cane]]. Like regular deserts, the ground was completely covered with sand and no rain occurred here. [[Cacti]], [[dead bush]]es, [[fossil]]s, and [[desert well]]s generated here, but [[village]]s and [[desert pyramid]]s did not.

== Mobs ==
Desert lakes used the same mob spawning chances as deserts.

The following mobs naturally spawned here:
