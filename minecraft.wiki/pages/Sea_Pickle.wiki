A '''sea pickle''' is a small block that emits light underwater, and is typically found in colonies of up to four sea pickles.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Sea pickles can be broken instantly with any tool including hands. Each colony drops 1-4 sea pickles, depending on how many are in the colony (so a colony of 3 pickles drops 3 pickles).

{{breaking row|Sea Pickle|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[Sea Pickle (feature)|Sea pickle colonies]] generate on the bottom of warm oceans and are found on top of [[coral block]]s in [[coral reef]]s. Each chunk has {{frac|1|6}} chance to generate sea pickle colonies. They can be found in groups of 1 up to 4.

Sea pickles may also be found in [[desert village]] houses as decorative blocks that resemble pottery.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 sea pickle for 2 [[emerald]]s.
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
Using [[bone meal]] on an underwater sea pickle placed on top of a living [[coral block]] creates more sea pickles. Specifically, the colony to which bone meal is applied increases in size, and any living coral block within a [[taxicab distance]] of 2 blocks (horizontally from either the coral block or the sea pickle itself) can generate 1-3 sea pickles. They do not grow or spread naturally, and do not require light. 

== Usage ==
=== Placing ===
Sea pickles can be placed on top of most solid [[block]]s, as well as non-solid blocks, up to four per block, similar to [[turtle egg]]s or [[candle]]s. More information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

{{IN|Bedrock}}, unlike [[Turtle Egg|turtle eggs]], sea pickles can only be placed on complete blocks.

=== Light ===
Sea pickles produce light when underwater. A single pickle produces a light level of 6, and a colony produces an additional 3 levels per pickle (so 4 sea pickles produces a light level of 15). When they produce light, there is a pale green glow at the end of the pickle.

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the center of lit sea pickles emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{color|#b0dad3}}. This causes the bottom part of sea pickles to render a small square shadow.

=== Growing ===
[[Bone meal]] can be {{control|used}} on sea pickles if they are underwater and planted on living [[coral block]]s. This increases their number on that block, and they spread to ''empty'' areas underwater above other living coral blocks. They can spread to the original sea pickle's level or one level below, out to a horizontal [[taxicab distance]] of 2.

== Trivia ==
* Sea pickles are based on real-life {{W|Pyrosome|sea pickles|newtab=1}}, which are free-floating colonial {{W|Tunicata|tunicates|newtab=1}} with blue-green {{W|bioluminescence|newtab=1}}, more properly known as pyrosomes. Unlike the ''Minecraft'' version, they are not stationary organisms and are an entirely different species.<ref>{{Mcnet|sea-pickle|Taking Inventory: Sea Pickle|December 20, 2023|[[Duncan Geere]]}}</ref>
