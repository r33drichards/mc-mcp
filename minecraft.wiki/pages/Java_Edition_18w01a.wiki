== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|teleport}}'''
* Added <code>facing</code> to the command.
** Syntax: {{cmd|teleport [<targets>] (<location>{{!}}<destination>) facing (<facingEntity>{{!}}<facingLocation>)}}
** Rotates an entity to face either an entity or a location.

'''{{cmd|time}}'''
* Added <code>noon</code> and <code>midnight</code> to {{cmd|time set}}.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Added <code>set_name</code> function to loot tables.
* Functions tagged in <code>minecraft:load</code> now run once after a (re)load.
* Added the new block tag <code>minecraft:anvil</code>.
** Contains <code>minecraft:anvil</code>, <code>minecraft:chipped_anvil</code>, and <code>minecraft:damaged_anvil</code>.

'''[[Death messages]]'''
* Added a death message for when a mob or player causes another player to die in the void.
** "''Player'' didn't want to live in the same world as ''Player/Mob''".

== Changes ==
=== Command format ===
* Changed all custom names (blocks, items, entities, block entities) to translatable text components.
** Removed the <code>LocName</code> tag. Instead of <code>LocName:"gui.toTitle"</code>, use <code>Name:"{\"translate\":\"gui.toTitle\"}"</code>.
* <code>Thrower</code> and <code>Owner</code> nbt keys of [[item entities]] are no longer strings but are instead compounds with two longs named <code>L</code> and <code>M</code>.
* <code>owner</code> nbt keys of [[snowball]]s, [[egg]]s and [[ender pearl]]s are no longer strings but are instead compounds with two longs named <code>L</code> and <code>M</code>.

=== General ===
'''Crashes'''
* Crash reports now list what data packs are enabled.

'''Data generators'''
* Now exposed, the player can get a dump of all blocks/items/commands/etc. from the game without opening it up.
