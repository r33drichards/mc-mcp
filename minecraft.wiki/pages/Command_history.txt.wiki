'''<samp>command_history.txt</samp>''' is a text file found in the root of the <samp>[[.minecraft]]</samp> folder which stores a list of commands the [[player]] has entered in-game.

== Usage ==
The command history file is used to persist command history between worlds and sessions. The command and chat history can be navigated through by pressing {{key|up}} or {{key|down}} while the chat is opened. Regular chat messages do not persist between worlds but commands do.

== Contents ==
The file is simply a one-per-line list of commands that have been typed, including the slashes. It is sorted in chronological order.

Up to 50 commands are stored in this file.

Example:
<pre>
/locate biome minecraft:plains
/spreadplayers 1000 700 10 100 false @a
/time add 200
/effect give @a minecraft:night_vision
/give @p command_block
</pre>
