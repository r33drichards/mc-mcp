== History ==
The update was announced on October 4, 2010 on Notch's blog.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1243370641</ref> A new type of block was announced on October 8, and on October 11 Notch posted a statement on his Twitter saying: "I just made the most unfair mob ever even more unfair. You will hate the [[Ghast]]."<ref>{{tweet|notch|27054892351|I just made the most unfair mob ever even more unfair. You will hate the Ghast.|October 11, 2010}}</ref> On October 10, 2010, Notch posted the first image of [[the Nether]] on his blog.

On October 19, it was announced that there were six new block types (of which five had unique abilities), one new monster, a new dimension, and a couple of bug fixes.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/1351006839/calm-before-the-storm</ref>

On October 22, [https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-halloween-update-preview-meet-the-ghasts/ PC Gamer] posted an article giving more details about the new update. The article states that Ghasts "are flying cuboid jellyfish that could shoot fireballs at you, blowing chunks out of the world around you and setting it on fire." It also states that the [[Nether portal]]s to go to and from the Hell dimension is made from [[obsidian]].

On October 25, Notch tweeted that he was working on a second, more harmless mob.<ref>{{tweet|notch|28689926226|Anyway! I'm working on the second new mob today, and it's far less dangerous than the Ghast. Right now they're kind of pointless, actually!|October 25, 2010}}</ref> This was later revealed to be the [[zombie pigman]].

Torches were planned to become temporary light sources with the new permanent light source being lanterns, but the update didn't make it in time. [[Lantern]]s, however, were added in the [[Java Edition 18w46a|Java snapshot 18w46a]] and [[Bedrock Edition 1.9.0|Bedrock 1.9.0]] versions.

== Trivia ==
* The "poster" was located at minecraft.net/boo, which no longer exists. An archive of it is available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20101204044906/http://www.minecraft.net/boo/ archive.org]
* The poster said that pumpkins were "useless", while now, they provide a shield against provoking [[endermen]].
* The poster said "Portal in, move 10 meters, portal out, and you're hundreds of meters away." Since portals move the player by a factor of 8, 10 meters away in the Nether is 80 meters away in the Overworld, not hundreds.
