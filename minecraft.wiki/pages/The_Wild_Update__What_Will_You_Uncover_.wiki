'''The Wild Update: What Will You Uncover?''', also known as '''The Wild – Adventure''',<ref name=":Brikk">{{Citation|url=https://brikk.se/en/cases/game-trailers/minecraft-the-wild/|title=Minecraft, The Wild – Adventure|website=Produktionsbolag Brikk}}</ref> is a promotional video for [[The Wild Update]], telling a story about two heroes discovering the [[deep dark]].

== Summary ==
[[Sunny]] and [[Efe]] are exploring the [[Cave|underground]] with caution, when suddenly a [[chicken]] appears. Sunny tries to approach the chicken, only for it to run away. The two chase it through a [[mineshaft]], briefly bumping into [[Steve]] and [[Alex]], both confused by the encounter. Eventually, they run straight into the deep dark, setting off various [[sculk shriekers]] before losing the chicken in the [[ancient city]]. While Efe and Sunny know to be careful and quiet, the chicken exhibits traits inferring low intelligence and pecks on one [[sculk sensor]] too many, summoning the [[warden]]. Engulfed by the shadow of the warden, Sunny and Efe are terrified but remain calm as it tries to sniff them out. Sure enough, the chicken lays an [[egg]], presumably out of fear, alerting it of their presence. The video ends on a cliffhanger.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Watch your step and tread carefully. The Wild Update brings the deep dark to Minecraft. This new biome is full of different types of sculk blocks and a deafening silence. Explore the ancient cities and face off with the warden on June 7. Stay tuned to discover everything that’s coming in Minecraft 1.19!|Video description}}
{{Quote|Mojang wanted to showcase how everyone’s Minecraft experience is unique and personal. Players can, for example, explore the new scary biome the Deep Dark, where the terrifying warden lives. Or they can take it easy and hang in the mangrove, breed frogs, or why not set sail in a boat with a chest and go on an expedition?So instead of making just one trailer, we decided to make three to show all the new updates and the different paths the player can take.This update has something for everyone!|Account of how the video was conceived<ref name=":Brikk" />}}
