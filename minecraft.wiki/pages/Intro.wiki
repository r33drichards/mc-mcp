'''"Intro"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Beta]]''.

== Track description ==
"Intro" starts with vinyl static that is stopped by C418 pushing a button on the turntable. He then sits down and plays a melody with his piano, humming along the way. As the song progresses, strings, echoing synthesized sounds, and other recordings of his voice, fade in afterwards, until eventually the song reaches its climax. The vocals remain stuck on loop as the other instruments fade out, before the song returns to vinyl static.

== Trivia ==
* "Intro" is one of only two tracks on ''Minecraft - Volume Beta'' to feature a description of some kind.
** The description of "Intro" may be because the song fades into the opening track of C418's following project, [https://c418.bandcamp.com/album/148 ''148''].
