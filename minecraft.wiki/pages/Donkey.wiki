A '''donkey''' is a [[passive mob]] similar to a [[horse]] that, when [[Taming|tamed]], can be [[saddle]]d, [[ridden]] and equipped with a [[chest]] to transport [[items]].

== Spawning ==
{{IN|JE}}, donkeys spawn commonly in [[meadow]]s in groups of 1-2, and less commonly in [[plains]] in groups of 1-3 and [[savanna]]s individually. 20% of all individual donkeys naturally spawn as babies. All donkeys spawn as adults when using spawn eggs, unless the spawn egg is {{control|used}} on a donkey.<ref>{{bug|MC-160945|||WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|BE}}, 2-6 donkeys spawn in plains, 1-2 in meadows and 1-3 in savannas.

{{Mob spawn table}}

== Appearance ==
Adult donkeys are 1.4 blocks wide and long, and 1.6 blocks high. Baby donkeys start at half the size of adults and {{in|bedrock}}, get progressively bigger as they age. Unlike [[wolves]] and [[cat]]s, donkeys do not change appearance once they have been tamed, though tamed donkeys may be differentiated by giving them equipment.

Donkeys are smaller than horses and sport long, erect ears. Their manes do not protrude, but rather are drawn directly on the back of their heads and necks. All donkeys have gray-brown coats with darker ankles, ears, manes, and tails. Donkeys can be equipped with a saddle but cannot wear horse armor, and they can also be equipped with chests to store up to 15 stacks of items.

== Drops ==
=== Breeding ===
{{xp|1|7}} experience orbs upon a successful [[breeding]].

=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Leather|quantity=0-2|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* {{xp|1|3}}, when killed by a player or [[tamed wolf]].
* If equipped with a [[chest]] or [[saddle]], they drop those items. They also drop the contents of the chest.

Killing a baby donkey yields no items nor experience.

== Behavior ==
Donkeys roam around idly, occasionally stopping to rear, swish their tails, or lower their heads as though eating the grass. Unlike [[sheep]], the eating animation does not actually cause any grass to be consumed. A donkey may turn to look at a player who comes near. Any donkey, even a wild one, allows itself to be attached to a [[lead]] without protest. However, if the player attempts to saddle an untamed donkey, it rears and flails its front hooves. Donkeys remain passive, even when hit.

Donkeys can safely fall 6 blocks before they begin to accumulate [[fall damage]], unlike most mobs, which can only safely fall 3 blocks. Donkeys also take half of the normal fall damage (rounded up) that most other mobs take ({{hp|0.5}} damage per block over the safe distance instead of {{hp|1}}). If an entity is riding a donkey, they receive the same fall damage as the donkey.

Donkeys occasionally emit a braying sound.

Adult donkeys cannot ride a [[boat]], though babies can.

Donkeys have a {{frac|1|900}} chance to regenerate {{hp|1}} health point each game tick.{{verify|edition=bedrock}}

=== Taming ===
Adult donkeys can be tamed. {{IN|je}}, a player mounts a donkey by pressing {{control|use}} on it with an empty hand. {{IN|be}}, the player can also hold an object that cannot be used on a donkey. A player tames an adult donkey by repeatedly mounting it until the donkey stops bucking off the player and shows hearts. It is necessary to tame a donkey in order to breed it, give it equipment, or ride it for any length of time. 

Taming depends on the donkey's "temper". They begin with a temper of 0 out of 100. When a player is riding the donkey, a random number between 0 and 99 is chosen. The donkey becomes tame if this number is less than the temper, otherwise, the temper is increased by 5 and the player is bucked off. Temper can also be increased by feeding the donkey.

While riding an untamed donkey, a galloping sound is audible, more or less rapid. This gives a general idea of the donkey's speed.

Like all tamed animals, a death message is displayed to their owner if they are killed.{{only|be}}

=== Breeding ===
Feeding tamed donkeys [[golden apple]]s or [[golden carrot]]s activates [[love mode]].

Baby donkeys appear more spindly than adults. A baby donkey can be fed to make it mature faster. {{IN|BE}} a baby donkey grows progressively larger until reaching adult size, while {{in|java}} a baby turns into an adult after sufficient time passes. A baby donkey is not tamed, and can be tamed after it grows into an adult. 

Cross-breeding a donkey with a [[horse]] creates a [[mule]] baby. Mules cannot breed.

=== Food ===
Feeding a donkey food may alter its behavior and cause it to grow (if it is not yet an adult; baby donkeys normally take 20 minutes to fully mature if not fed), and restore its health.

{{IN|be}}, the health of baby donkeys cannot be restored by feeding.

{{IN|je}}, feeding tamed donkeys at full health has no sound effect and movements.<ref>{{bug|MC-233276|||Fixed}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-236341|||Fixed}}</ref> {{IN|be}}, while temper is at max value, untamed donkeys can be fed any food except hay bale.

To feed a donkey, hold a valid food item and press {{control|use}} on the donkey.

The table below lists the effects of the various foods donkeys can consume.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult untamed donkey to form a [[jockey]].

== Statistics ==
{{see also|Tutorial:Horses}}

All donkeys have three "equine stats": health, (maximum) movement speed, and jump strength. {{IN|JE}}, each of these can vary between individual donkeys. {{IN|BE}}, only health can vary. These stats are created once the donkey is born or spawned, and are not affected by food.

=== Spawned values ===
When spawned in any way except breeding – for instance, using commands, spawning naturally or using spawn eggs – donkeys are assigned their stats within certain ranges, specific according to their horse type.

==== Health ====
Donkey's [[health]] ranges from 15–30, with an average of {{hp|22.5}}. A donkey with an odd number of health points does not show the last half-heart. So if a donkey has 15 health ({{healthbar|15|9px|mob=1}}), its health bar will only display 14 health ({{healthbar|14|9px|mob=1}}). And if the donkey took {{hp|3|mob=1}} damage, it would have 12 health left {{healthbar|12|9px|total=14|mob=1}}, but it would seem like it only took {{hp|2|mob=1}}, since the bar only shows 2 points of damage.

==== Movement speed ====
A spawned donkey's speed value is always 0.175, but it moves at the slightly reduced 7.38 blocks/sec. For reference, the player's normal walking speed is 0.1, equivalent to 4.3 blocks/sec, and the player's sprinting speed is equivalent to 5.6 blocks/sec. The speed listed does not include any [[status effect]] that affects the speed of a horse or a player.

See ''[[Transportation#Methods|transportation]]'' to compare the speeds of various transportation methods.

==== Jump strength ====
A spawned donkey's jump strength is always 0.5, enough to clear {{frac|1|9|16}} blocks. 

=== Bred values ===
When breeding two donkeys, the baby's stats are determined by a variation of the average of both parents' stats, randomly determined the same way [[Horse#Statistics|horses' stats]] are. 

==== Movement Speed ====
{{IN|BE}}, all donkeys have a speed value of 0.175 regardless of whether they were spawned or bred.

{{IN|JE}}, a bred donkey's speed value has the same limits as other horses, between 0.1125 and 0.3375. See [[Horse#Movement speed]]. 

==== Jump Strength ====
{{IN|BE}}, all donkeys have a jump strength of 0.5, regardless of whether they were spawned or bred.

{{IN|JE}}, A bred donkey's jump strength has the same limits as other horses, between 0.4 and 1.0. See [[Tutorial:Horses#Jump_Strength]].

== Usage ==
{{see also|Transportation}}

Tamed and [[saddle]]d donkeys are some of the fastest means of transportation or hauling in the game, although they are unable to fit through single block-wide openings. They can also be used to climb hills and jump fences, which the player can't generally.

Donkeys can be equipped with chests and used as pack animals. They can also be pulled along and tied up using a [[lead]].

=== Equipment ===
[[File:Donkey GUI Chest.png|thumb|right|GUI of a donkey, when equipped with a chest.]]

Tamed donkeys can have the following [[slot]]s available:
* {{SlotSprite|Saddle}} Saddle Slot: For equipping a [[saddle]].
* {{InvSprite|Chest}} An additional 15 inventory slots, ''provided'' the donkey has been equipped with a [[chest]].

A saddle can be equipped on a donkey by holding it and then {{control|using}} on the donkey, or by accessing its inventory. A donkey’s inventory can be accessed by mounting the donkey and using the {{control|inventory}} control, by {{control|using}} while {{ctrl|sneaking}}, or by pressing the "open inventory" button{{only|bedrock}} on the donkey. The saddle can be removed by either removing it from the donkey's inventory or by using [[shears]] on the donkey.

A donkey can be equipped with a [[chest]] by {{control|using}} a chest on the donkey. The chest cannot be removed except by killing the donkey, which causes the chest and its contents to drop.

Baby donkeys cannot be equipped with anything.

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}

Once a donkey is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls, {{control|jump}}, and the mouse. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control. Like riding other entities, it is impossible for a player to use a [[nether portal]] or [[end portal]] while on a donkey.

A ridden saddled donkey automatically runs up any one block high slope. The donkey and rider can safely fit through a space as low as 2.75 blocks high. Lower clearance risks suffocating the rider if the rider's head enters a non-transparent block. The donkey itself can enter gaps as low as 1.625 blocks high, but may itself take suffocation damage when clearance is less than 1.75 blocks. They cannot fit through a 1-block-wide gap.

Unlike horses, all naturally spawned donkeys have the same movement speed and jump strength. Donkeys are slow-moving backward and about as fast as the player when moving sideways.

Ridden saddled donkeys have the ability of "jump charging". {{IN|je}}, when the player rides them, the experience bar on [[HUD]] is replaced by the jump bar, and the hunger bar is replaced by the donkey's health bar. {{IN|be}}, both bars display, and the experience bar is replaced by the jump bar only when jumping, with the experience level number remaining visible. A ridden saddled donkey can be made to {{control|jump}}, and holding the control charges for a higher leap. Donkeys are not affected by Jump Boost beacons.

== Issues ==
{{issue list|Donkey}}

== Trivia ==
* If a player picks up [[leather]] dropped by an adult donkey, they receive the "[[Cow Tipper]]" [[achievement]]. This is due to the achievement being given when a player picks up any piece of leather instead of being given when killing a [[cow]].
* A player riding a donkey is dragged along if the donkey is being pulled by a lead, and can even be lifted up in the air in the same way.
* Using commands, it is possible to make a donkey with no armor slot, but also no way to equip a chest.
* In the ''Bedrock Edition'', the donkey can be transported in a [[boat]] by riding the donkey and jumping into the boat then dismounting (leaving the donkey behind in the boat) and activating the boat from underneath/underwater. Attempting to activate the boat to pilot it from above results in the player being mounted on the donkey again rather than being placed inside the boat to pilot it.
