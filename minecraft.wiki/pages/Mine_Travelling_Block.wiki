The '''mine travelling block'''{{note|Spelt in this way in-game.}} is a block added in [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine]].

== Usage ==
The mine travelling block is used to send the player in and out of a [[Mine (dimension)|mine]] upon being clicked. It displays an ever-growing countdown using the [[action bar]] before teleporting the player to the dimension set or back to the Hub.

== Obtaining ==
The mine travelling block cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. The block can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}}, and naturally generates in the [[hub]] above a [[mine crafter]] and in the [[mine exit]]. It cannot be destroyed by [[tool]]s or [[explosion]]s.
