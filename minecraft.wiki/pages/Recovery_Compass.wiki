A '''recovery compass''' is an [[item]] that can be held by a [[player]] who has [[died]] to point to where their most recent death occurred, as long as they are in the same [[dimension]]. If these conditions are not met, it will spin in random directions.

== Obtaining ==

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A1= Echo Shard |B1= Echo Shard   |C1= Echo Shard
|A2= Echo Shard |B2= Compass      |C2= Echo Shard
|A3= Echo Shard |B3= Echo Shard   |C3= Echo Shard
|Output= Recovery Compass
|type= Utility
}}

== Usage ==
When held by a player, the recovery compass points toward the location where the player last died.

The recovery compass works only when it is held by a player who has previously died and is in the same dimension as their last death. Otherwise, it spins around randomly.

Like other items, the recovery compass itself still drops when a player dies if the <code>keepInventory</code> [[game rule]] is not enabled.

This item is useless on [[Hardcore mode]], where the player cannot respawn.

The location the recovery compass points to is stored as the player's {{cd|LastDeathLocation}} NBT tag, and can be accessed with the {{cmd|data get @s LastDeathLocation}} command if cheats are enabled.

As with the normal compass, it also points toward the position of last death when viewed in the [[Crafting Table|crafting table]] preview menu, even without being crafted.{{Only|Bedrock}} The direction of the needle is relative to the player viewing it.  Carrying a crafting table to find your lost items for this purpose is much cheaper than crafting the compass and potentially losing it.

=== Enchantments ===

== Trivia ==
The recovery compass is the only item which, {{in|java}}, can neither be used in the world{{note|In this context, "used in the world" means the item can be placed down as a block, has special functionality when {{control|used}} in any game mode, or has special functionality when in entity form.}} nor used as an input for crafting, smelting, enchanting or other GUI-based activities. In other words, it is the only item whose unique functionality derives solely from its texture. ([[Clock]]s are similar, but attract piglins when in entity form.) This makes it useful as a "dummy item" in commands, as a renamed and retextured recovery compass does not inherit any of the gameplay properties of a regular recovery compass.
