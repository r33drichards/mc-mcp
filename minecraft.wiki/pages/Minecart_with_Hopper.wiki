A '''minecart with hopper''' is a [[minecart]] with a [[hopper]] inside. Unlike a normal hopper, it pulls items from containers much more quickly, cannot push items into containers, can collect [[item entities]] through a single layer of [[solid block]]s, and is locked and unlocked via [[activator rail]]s.

Minecarts with hoppers can be retrieved by attacking them. By doing so, it drops as an [[item (entity)|item]] along with the contents of the hopper. [[Critical hits]] are not applied to them although the particles suggest otherwise.

== Usage ==
[[File:Minecart with Hopper GUI.png|thumb|176px|The GUI of a minecart with hopper.]]
Minecarts with hoppers are placed similarly to other [[minecart]]s.

A minecart with hopper pulls in items lying nearby (within a range slightly larger than the cart itself), or inside a container directly above the minecart, at a high speed. In [[Java Edition|''Java Edition'']] a hopper minecart pulls items from a container directly above the minecart at a speed of one item every [[game tick]] in (20 items per second), eight times as fast as a normal hopper. In [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock Edition'']] it pulls an item only every two game ticks (10 items per second), four times as fast as a normal hopper. It also picks up items that are lying on a block directly above the track. It does not push items into containers, but a hopper underneath the track can remove items from a minecart with hopper on the track. Ordinary hoppers can also drop items into a minecart with hopper like other containers, at the normal speed of 2.5 items per second. In ''Bedrock Edition'' a minecart with hopper on a curved rail pulls in items in a hopper lying in front of its moving direction and one block above if the hopper's output funnel is pointed downward and no block is below that hopper.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-94293}}</ref>

The minecart with hopper can be disabled by passing over a powered [[activator rail]], and can be reenabled by an inactive activator rail.

An empty minecart with hopper can travel more than 85 blocks without stopping (as opposed to a normal cart going less than 12 blocks) from a dead stop using a two-powered track starter, even with another minecart in front of it. However, the distance traveled by a minecart with hopper depends on the hopper's load. Using a one-powered rail starter track, a minecart with an empty hopper travels 64 blocks until it stops (as opposed to an empty normal minecart going 8 blocks). The distance traveled diminishes non-linearly with increased hopper load; a minecart with a full hopper can travel only 16 blocks in this setup.

Minecarts with hoppers use the Friendly Creatures sound category for [[Sound#Entity-dependent categories|entity-dependent sound events]].<ref group=sound name=rollsource>{{bug|MC-42132}}</ref>

=== Entity data ===
Minecarts with hoppers have entity data associated with them that contain various properties of the entity.
