A '''swamp oak''' is a variant of [[oak]] only found in [[swamp]]s. Unlike regular and fancy oaks, swamp oaks only generate naturally and cannot be grown from [[oak sapling]]s.

== Appearance ==
Swamp oaks have round, flat-topped canopies. They tend to be covered in [[vines]] that trail down to the ground. Compared to regular oaks, their canopies are 2 blocks wider. They are also generally slightly taller than regular oaks, with their trunks ranging from 5 to 8 blocks tall.

== Generation ==
Swamp oaks generate naturally only in the [[swamp]] biome. They can be found on land or in water up to 2 blocks deep.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from a swamp oak:
* {{BlockLink|Oak Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
* {{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Planks}} (crafted from a log in the inventory crafting grid or a crafting table)
* {{BlockLink|Stripped Oak Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
* {{BlockLink|Oak Sapling}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{ItemLink|Apple}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
* {{BlockLink|Vines}} (harvested with [[shears]])
