}}'''Ice Cube''' is a fictionalized depiction of [[O'Shea Jackson Sr.]], appearing as both the main protagonist and antagonist of [[Ice Cube Claims Adjuster]].

== Appearance ==
Ice Cube is a dark-skinned elderly middle-aged man wearing a gray and blue shirt with a black tie. He is also dressed in gray pants and old black headphones with a microphone. He is dressed this way in all episodes of [[Ice Cube Claims Adjuster]], however during [[Sleeping in the Nether]] he briefly adopts a transformed monster, with all-black eyes and missing teeth.

== Personality ==
Despite working for an insurance firm in an "Ice Cubicle," Ice Cube is shown to be a very abrasive individual. While he is shown possessing empathy, his first response will often be mockery, refusing to help with problems beyond passive aggressive advice. This is to a point where he has to remind himself not to accept any claims, and when he does give advice it will often be counterintuitive, such as not sleeping. Moreover, he will often express anger and aggression, beating his own [[computer]], [[Larry.exe]], and breaking equipment.

In spite of these issues, he appears passionate about his job, keeping a framed picture of a coworker on his wall and drinking out of a water cooler filled with coffee to work as much as possible. On [[Going AFK|one occasion]] he attempted to both multitask and fasten his work flow, creatively using two keyboards at once.

== Powers and abilities ==
Although working a mundane job, Ice Cube is shown to possess many superhuman abilities. From his first video alone, he is propelled into the air by a constant stream of [[experience]], and at the start of a second appears to have survived a [[ghast]] fireball with minimal injury. Later in the video he confesses to lacking sleep, and abruptly begins transforming into a demonic-like state. In this form his screams appear to cause an EMP, corrupting the camera equipment used for the video. A similar occurrence happens at the start of the third video, where he vomits out keyboard keys.

He is frequently shown to be very strong, being able to break glass with little effort, and repeatedly break the floor beneath him with just a kick. In ''Going AFK'', he demonstrates gravity by falling through both the [[Overworld]] and [[Nether]], surviving a fall from around 896 blocks, or 2,939.63264 feet. However, he is not indestructible, remarking that a blow from an [[ice]] block will "hurt in the morning."
