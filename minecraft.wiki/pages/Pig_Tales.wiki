'''Pig Tales''' was a mini site within [[Minecraft website|Minecraft.net]] that allowed users to create and share their own conversations that starred two Minecraft [[Pig]] sock puppets known as Pig #1 and Pig #2 in front of an obviously fake set. The conversation ended with a dramatic zoom-in on Pig #1. The films were made in retro style and were "produced" by a fake Swedish company called Mackapar Films.

The mini site was set up on August 22, 2011 and on August 26th, the Pig Tales conversation was revealed. These Minecraft socks were made by a Swedish company called Happy Socks and were listed on their website [https://web.archive.org/web/20131205021843/http://www.happysocks.com/us/minecraft/ here].

As of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160503211940/https://www.mojang.com/2016/05/minecraftnet-20-has-been-deployed/ Minecraft.net 2.0 Redesign], this site is no longer available. An archived version is available [https://web.archive.org/web/20110919061749/http://pigtales.minecraft.net/ here].

* The man "acting" (holding the socks) was [[Jeb]].

* Mackapär is actually a Swedish word for gadget, which is a synonym to the word mojäng.
