The '''potato peeler''' is a joke [[weapon]] added in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Crafting ===
The recipe is unlocked in the [[recipe book]] after obtaining [[shears]].

{{crafting
|A2=Stick
|B1=Shears
|Output = Potato Peeler
|ignoreusage=1
}}

== Usage ==
=== Attacking ===
Potato peelers can be used to damage [[potato mobs]] for {{hp|12}}. When attacking other mobs, it deals only {{hp|2}} damage. It has a very fast attack speed of 5 and only takes 0.2 seconds to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]].

=== Enchantments ===
Despite having similar functionality to a [[sword]], potato peelers can't receive any enchantments in Survival mode, whether it be through an enchanting table or an anvil. They also do not do [[sweep attack]]s.

=== Peeling ===
When potato mobs are killed by the peeler, they can drop [[potato peels]], depending on the mob type. Peelers can also be {{control|used}} on potato sheep to drop the peels corresponding to sheep's wool color.

{{Control|Using}} the peeler on a [[Peelgrass Block|peelgrass block]] or a [[Corrupted Peelgrass Block|corrupted peelgrass block]] converts it to [[terre de pomme]] and drops lime potato peels or [[Corrupted Potato Peels|corrupted potato peels]], respectively. The peeler can also be {{control|used}} on [[blocks of potato peels]], which destroys the block and drops 9 peels of the corresponding type. <!-- (confirmation needed)
