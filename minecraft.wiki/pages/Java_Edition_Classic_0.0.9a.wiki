'''0.0.9a'''<ref name="Tigsource"/><ref>[http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/castle.png "castle.png"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150402230943/http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/castle.png Archive]) – jwaap, PhotoBucket; as mentioned in [https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=6273 Tigsource] and [[#logs|IRC logs]] ("''(16:34:37) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/castle.png''")</ref><ref name=":0">[http://web.archive.org/web/20101227155640/http://www.youtube.com:80/watch?v=3XpSaBZchEs&feature=related Archived video] (non-functional)</ref> is a version of [[Java Edition Classic]] released on May 16, 2009, at 19:15 UTC,<ref name="new version out">[[#logs|TigIRC logs]]: "''(15:15:08) notch: new version out, you can't build in a space you're occupying, and I fixed a small graphical glitch with preview tiles''" [...] "''(16:11:54) jw: minecraft is awesome D;''", "''(16:11:57) jw: and in your browser''" [...] "''(16:15:06) jw: I am so building a castle''" [...] "''(16:34:37) jw: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/oo269/jwaap/castle.png''" (19:15 to 20:34 UTC)</ref><ref name="last night">[[#lwjgl logs|lwjgl IRC logs]]: "''[13:15:36] <Notch_> i did a small update late last night, but nothing that should fix that, I think''" (May 17, 11:15 UTC)</ref> which added a new building mode and a counter for displaying frame rate and chunk updates, changed the resolution and fixes bugs.

Notch did not release versions ''0.0.4a'' through ''0.0.8a'', if they even existed to begin with.{{note|A screenshot of 0.0.9a was released an hour after Notch announced the release of a new version,<ref name="new version out"/> which in turn was an hour after the previous version announcement (for [[0.0.3a]]),<ref>[[#logs|TigIRC logs]]: "''(14:05:16) notch: fartron: I uploaded 0.0.3 with caves. Does it load the new version properly if you reload the page?''" (18:05 UTC)</ref> which itself came out an hour after [[0.0.2a]]. It is unlikely Notch released five versions without announcement in this two-hour window. Notch may have bumped the minor version to "9" to denote it being close for a public release, which would have been [[0.0.10a]] had that version not had a major playability issue.}}

== Additions ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Right-click switches between placing and destroying modes.<ref>[[#logs|TigIRC logs]]: "''(14:49:37) notch: I'm switching so that rmb = toggle edit mode now''"</ref>
** Selecting a block now shows a white overlay on all sides of the block.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
* Changed the game's resolution from 1024×768 to 640×480.{{Check version}}{{note|This change possibly happened at least as far back as [[Java Edition Classic mc-161607|mc-161607]], because it was tested that 1024x768 resolution makes the version number on the top left corner slightly stretched by a few pixels, indicating that the change happened in an earlier version.}}

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed a graphical glitch with preview tiles in the newly added build mode.{{cn}}
* Players can no longer build inside of themselves.

== Bugs ==
'''1 bug reported'''
* The white screen issue from [[0.0.3a]] still affects the game for some testers.<ref>[[#logs|TigIRC logs]]: "''(04:18:12) SimonTheDigger: all I get is a white screen''" [...] "''(04:21:12) Super-Dot: I got the white screen too, on Windows''" [...] "''(04:21:55) notch: If you're on an [[wikipedia:Asus Eee|Eee]], that's probably why. I get the same thing on mine''" (08:18 to 08:21 UTC, May 17)</ref><ref>[[#logs|TigIRC logs]]: "''(16:59:42) Super-Dot: Hmm, white screen''"</ref>
