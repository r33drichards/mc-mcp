A '''sunflower''' is a tall [[flower]] that generates exclusively in [[sunflower plains]] biomes. It can be crafted into [[yellow dye]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A sunflower can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A sunflower also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Sunflower|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===

Sunflowers generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[sunflower plains]] as part of [[vegetation]] features.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a sunflower, the flower drops a copy of itself.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, sunflowers can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[Pale Moss Block|pale moss blocks]], [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Like other tall flowers, sunflowers cannot be placed inside [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Navigation ===
Sunflowers always face east, making them useful for navigation if the [[sun]] is not visible. This also works in the [[Nether]] and the [[End]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with sunflowers, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding===
Sunflowers can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a sunflower have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a sunflower into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of sunflowers yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
