'''Beta 1.21.70.20''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.70.20''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the first beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.70]], released on January 30, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/33873681034637-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-70-20|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.70.20|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=January 30, 2025}}</ref> which adds new [[cow]] variants, [[leaf litter]]s, [[wildflowers]], [[bush]]es, [[firefly bush]]es, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Donkey]]'''
*Donkeys now spawn in [[savanna]]s.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Dark Forest]]'''
*Updated the tree composition in dark forests to match {{JE}}, increasing the number of dark oak trees and reducing the prevalence of other tree types.

'''[[Short Grass]]'''
*Now generate slightly sparser in [[meadow]]s.

=== Technical ===
'''API - Scripting'''
*Unhandled rejected promises in scripting now include callstacks when logged.

:@minecraft/server 1.18.0
*Renamed {{cd|system.scriptEvent}} to {{cd|system.sendScriptEvent}}.
*Moved {{cd|NamespaceNameErrorReason}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|@minecraft/server 1.18.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|system.sendScriptEvent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|@minecraft/server 1.18.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|NamespaceNameError}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|@minecraft/server 1.18.0}}.
*Released {{cd|InputInfo.getButtonState}}, {{cd|InputButton}}, and {{cd|ButtonState}} to {{cd|@minecraft/server 1.18.0}}.
*Released {{cd|InputInfo.getMovementVector}} to {{cd|@minecraft/server 1.18.0}}.
*Released {{cd|PlayerButtonInputAfterEvent}}, {{cd|AfterEvents.playerButtonInput}} and {{cd|InputEventOptions}} to {{cd|@minecraft/server 1.18.0}}.
*Several APIs have been given the {{cd|Readonly}} permission, which allows them to now be called inside Before Event callbacks.
**All methods for {{cd|BlockVolume}}.
**All methods for {{cd|Vector}}.
*Changed {{cd|spawnEntity}} method on {{cd|Dimension}} to now take a variant of either a string or {{cd|EntityType}}.
*Added {{cd|placeFeature}} and {{cd|placeFeatureRule}} APIs to the {{cd|Dimension}} class.
*Added {{cd|isValid}} property to the {{cd|Camera}} class.

'''Blocks'''
*The {{cd|minecraft:map_color}} component underwent a schema change:
*It is now a JSON object with two fields {{cd|color}} and {{cd|tint_method}}.
*{{cd|color}} is a required string field expecting an HEX representation of the RGB, prefixed with a # character.
*{{cd|tint_method}} is a string field that multiplies the color with a predefined tint. Supported values are {{cd|none}}, {{cd|default_foliage}}, {{cd|birch_foliage}}, {{cd|evergreen_foliage}}, {{cd|grass}} and {{cd|water}}.
*The old schema format is still supported for convenience.
*Examples:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:map_color": {
  "color": "#ABCDEF",
  "tint_method": "grass"
}
</syntaxhighlight>
or
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:map_color": {
  "color": "#ABCDEF"
}
</syntaxhighlight>
or
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:map_color": "#ABCDEF"
</syntaxhighlight>

:Components
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:replaceable}} component which determines if a new block can replace the existing block at a particular position. If the component is not added to a block it is not replaceable.

'''Components'''
*Multiple components that used effect durations can now be set to {{cd|infinite}} including:
**{{cd|minecraft:attack}}: {{cd|effect_duration}}
**{{cd|minecraft:healable}}: {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|effects}} list
**{{cd|minecraft:mob_effect}}: {{cd|effect_time}}
**{{cd|minecraft:projectile}}: {{cd|durationeasy}}, {{cd|durationnormal}}, and {{cd|durationhard}} can now all use {{cd|infinite}}
**{{cd|minecraft:food}}: {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|effects}} list
**{{cd|minecraft:spell_effects}}: {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|add_effects}} list
**{{cd|minecraft:combat_regeneration}}: {{cd|regeneration_duration}}

'''JSON Events'''
*The parameter {{cd|duration}} in the {{cd|add_mob_effect}} event can now be set to {{cd|infinite}}.

'''Sounds'''
*Added support for entity sound variants:
**Entity sounds now have a {{cd|variants}} field which defines sound variants based on the runtime entity
**{{cd|variants}} has a {{cd|key}} field reading a Molang expression returning a string to select sound variant (eg: querying an enum entity property).
**{{cd|variants}} has a {{cd|map}} field which contains key-value pairs of a variant identifier and the sound events it overrides.
**When playing a sound for an entity we first try to calculate their variant and see if that variant overrides the sound event, if not we play the sound form the base entity. If that fails we fall back to the existing logic of running from {{cd|defaults}}.
*Example:
**Given a mob with the following property:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
"minecraft:emotional_state": {
  "type": "enum",
  "values": [ "neutral", "angry", "happy", "sad" ],
  "default": "neutral",
  "client_sync": true
}
</syntaxhighlight>

*Sound variants can be played by querying the property:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
{
  "entity_sounds": {
    "entities": {
      "test_mob": {
        "volume": 1.0,
        "pitch": 1.0,
        // The base sounds for various events
        "events": {
          "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient",
          "death": "mob.test_mob.death",
          "step": {
            "sound": "mob.test_mob.step",
            "volume": 0.8,
            "pitch": 1.0
          },
          "attack": "mob.test_mob.attack"
        },
        "variants": {
            // Key returning the enum string for variants, can use any Molang expression resulting in a string
            "key": "query.property('minecraft:emotional_state')",
            "map": {
              // If a resulting variant key is not handled here then it will use the base sounds
              "neutral": {
                "volume": 1.0,
                "pitch": 1.0,
                "events": {
                  // If an event is not handled in a variant then it will use the base sound
                  "death": "mob.test_mob.death.netural"
                }
              },
              "angry": {
                "volume": 1.0,
                "pitch": 1.0,
                "events": {
                  // Variants can override different events than other variants
                  "death": "mob.test_mob.death.angry",
                  "ambient": "mob.test_mob.ambient.angry"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

'''Other'''
*Placing a block in liquid, and then placing another block next to your first block in liquid will no longer replace your second placed block for a moment causing you to fall into the liquid.
*Fixed a mismatch between server and client when continuously building that caused orientation sensitive blocks to sometimes change to the wrong block.
*Fixed a crash that would occur on Xbox if you pressed "Cancel" in the Xbox UI when converting a world or importing a world from Retail to Preview
*In Server Authoritative movement, when Players receive a movement correction it will use the current Player speed instead of a generic one, this should give a better experience.
*In Server Authoritative movement, when Players receive a downward movement correction it will now use gravity acceleration, this should give a better experience.
*Fix "Reset Random Tick Speed" button not working when editing an existing world on Realms.
*Bundle tooltip no longer flickers for players beyond the first when playing in split screen
*Adjusted Minecoin purchase screen UI to not show stray pixels. Fixed overlapping issue on PS4.
*Replacing items with the {{cd|lock_in_inventory}} component with items from the creative inventory using touch input now fails gracefully and produces a warning message.
*Fixed an issue where dark forests were missing trees along their northern borders with other biomes.
*{{cd|water}} and {{cd|lava}} no longer will turn into {{cd|flowing_water}} or {{cd|flowing_lava}} when neighbor updates happen. {{cd|water}} and {{cd|lava}} now will respond to queued ticks without needing to change into another block.
*Fixed an issue where {{cd|No more entities}} assert failure occurred when flying through biomes during a storm.
*Fixed {{cd|world_surface}} type of {{cd|heightmap_projection}} in {{cd|minecraft:jigsaw}} to generate on top of water and leaf blocks.
*Fixed a bug with water surface rendering that caused specular highlights to be much lower than they should have been in the Deferred Technical Preview.
*Resolve crash when changing point light shadow settings under Deferred Graphical Settings.
