'''24w14potato''' is an [[April Fools' Day jokes#2024|April Fools' Day joke]] snapshot, supposedly the first and only snapshot for the "'''Poisonous Potato Update'''", released alongside the [[Poisonous Potato Add-On]] for {{BE}} as part of the ''Poisonous Potato'' [[April Fools' Day]] event in 2024.<ref name="offical-announcement">{{Mcnet|poisonous-potato-update|Poisonous Potato Update|April 1, 2024}}</ref> The update is focused on the [[poisonous potato]], an item that is known for its lack of purpose, and adds the [[Poisonous Potato Dimension]].<ref>{{ytl|91PABUgBph4|Poisonous Potato Update}} on the Minecraft [[YouTube]] channel</ref> This snapshot is a fork of [[24w12a]].

The snapshot was reuploaded about 2 hours after the release to remove the Potato font; however, the font is still used in the [[Minecraft Launcher]]'s April Fools version.

=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Pedestal (24w14potato).png|32px]] [[Pedestal]]'''
* Can be found in the Overworld (in [[village]]s, [[ruined portatol]]s, and [[stronghold]]s), as well as in the Potato dimension (in [[potato village]]s, [[ruined portatol]]s, and [[colosseum]]s).
* Used to activate the [[potato portal]].
** When a poisonous potato is used on it, the potato portal generates above the pedestal.

'''[[File:Potato Portal.webp|32px]] [[Potato portal]]'''
* Allows the player to enter the Potato dimension.
* Has an item form with a very large and misshapen model that visually shows part of it outside the slot it is in.
* Works like a nether portal, requiring players in Survival to stand inside it for a few seconds before it transports them to the Potato dimension.

'''[[File:Big Brain.png|32px]] [[Big brain]]'''
* Crafted using a [[zombie head]] and 8 poisonous potatoes.
* Absorbs nearby [[experience]] orbs.
* When mined, it drops itself and a potato of knowledge with the same amount of experience as the block absorbed.
** Dropped potato of knowledge is limited to 1000 maximum experience.

'''{{Animate|Potato Battery.png; Inverted Potato Battery.png|32px}} [[Potato battery]]'''
* Can be toggled on or off by {{control|using}} it.
* While on, it emits a redstone signal of 15.
* When a living entity stands on the block, and the block is on, the block produces spark particles and the entity is constantly damaged, losing {{hp|1}} for every 2 times damaged.
* A player that dies to this block receives the following death message: '''''<player> was killed by a bad-tempered potato'''''

'''[[File:Poisonous Potato Cutter.gif|32px]] [[Poisonous potato cutter]]'''
* Functions like a stonecutter, except it can cut poisonous potatoes only into poisonous potato slices or poisonous potato sticks.

'''[[File:Frying Table.png|32px]] [[Frying table]]'''
* Fries potato peels, producing hash browns.
* Can also cook normal potatoes, as if they were cooked on a campfire.
* Mobs standing on the table play the damage animation, even though they don't take any actual damage.
** The player does not even play the damage animation alongside not taking damage. 

'''[[File:Potato Refinery (S).png|32px]] [[Potato refinery]]'''
* Can extract potato oil from potatoes or poisonous potato oil from poisonous potatoes.
* Can be used to apply potato oil to items and lubricate, making them slide when thrown. More potato oil increases the sliding factor, with diminishing returns.
** Due to floating-point imprecision, if an item is lubricated 55 times, its sliding factor reaches 1. If that item is then thrown, it never stops sliding in the direction it was thrown until it hits an obstacle, which makes it only slide along one axis.

'''[[File:Floatato.png|32px]] [[Floatato]]'''
* Generates as the clouds in the Potato dimension.
* Can be placed mid-air 2 blocks away from the player, instead of having to be placed on another block.

'''{{Animate|Floatater (S).png; Triggered Floatater (S).png|32px}} [[Floatater]]'''
* When powered by a redstone signal, it flies smoothly in the direction of the sticky side after 1 tick.
** A floatater structure is composed of all connected blocks in a 32×32×32 area and is stopped if any of these blocks are making contact with a block outside of it.
*** The size limit of the area it checks can be controlled by the game rule <code>floataterSizeLimit</code>.
** A block is considered connected if its outline box is touching that of a block being pushed by the floatater, ''not'' the floatater itself unless it's on the sticky side.
** Tile entities placed as a part of the floatater structure breaks off when the floatater begins moving, even if not pushed by anything.
*** Blocks connected to them are still moved.
** When multiple floataters facing the same direction are powered at the same time, the speed of the connected structure increases depending on how many floataters there are.
** Floataters can move blocks normally broken by piston pushing or those that cannot be moved, i.e. melons and redstone dust (not inclusive of tile entities such as shulker boxes and comparators, which break off when pushed).
* When a floatater contraption is moving, it can be stood on and push other entities. However, when moving into other moving floataters they go through each other.
* It flies until one of the blocks at the front of the floatater structure hits another irreplaceable block.

'''[[File:Powerful Potato.png|32px]] [[Powerful potato]]'''

* The top of the interface slowly stretches out to fit the title
* A feather can be inserted to the left.
* One or more toxic resins that match the quality and impurities of the first half of the title can be inserted and are "processed" into toxic resins of clarity and impurity described by the second half.
* The resulting impurity is not visible until after the fletching table successfully processes its first resin, being replaced by "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

* When the [[Villager Trade Rebalance]] experiment is enabled, the following trades are changed for villagers with this skin type:
** Librarians sell enchanted books with [[Multishot]], [[Impaling]] or [[Loyalty]] as their normal books, and [[Luck of the Sea]] II as their special book.

== Trivia ==
* This version does not include the "Java Edition" subtitle on the main menu.
* There are two references to "The Treachery of Images."
* [[Gnembon]] revealed that generative AI was used for a lot of the code, textures, and names for this version during a Q&A.<ref>{{ytl|T2WDfR-sPBg|t=1193|KIEDY NOWY BOSS? KIEDY MOBY Z MOBVOTE? WYWIAD z GNEMBONEM Cz.3 - PYTANIA OD WIDZÓW}} (in Polish)</ref>
* A "special" version of the [[End Poem]] can be seen if the player falls into the void of the Potato dimension. After the "Potato Poem" finishes, the player returns to their spawn point and is launched into the air, getting the "Sticky" effect.
