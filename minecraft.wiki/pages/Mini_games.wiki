'''Mini games''' are a variety of modes exclusive to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] of ''Minecraft''. Mini games can be played solo, [[splitscreen]] on the same console, online, or with another console locally via an ad-hoc connection.{{only|switch|vita|short=1}} The three mini games are [[Battle (mini game)|Battle]], [[Tumble]], and [[Glide (mini game)|Glide]]. 

Mini games are available on all versions of Legacy Console Edition. However, online play no longer works on the ''[[Wii U Edition]]'' due to the discontinuation of online services for the Wii U in April 2024.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u|title=Announcement of Discontinuation of Online Services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software|website=Nintendo Support}}</ref>

Prior to each round, all players can freely explore a lobby and interact with various items, such as [[bow]]s, [[fishing rod]]s, [[armor]], [[head]]s, [[elytra]], and [[music disc]]s. Any player who wears one of the six heads in the lobby retains that head into the next round.

== Lobby ==
[[File:Mini games lobby (new).png|thumb|300px|The mini game lobby.]]
Upon creating or joining a server, the player spawns in the lobby. It is a small "town" in the middle of a superflat world. All players are in adventure mode and are immune to damage (just like in creative mode). When playing with other players, the next game starts within one minute, although the player can create an invite-only game to gain the freedom to explore the lobby.

'''Exploration'''

The mini-game lobby is complex. There are many redstone puzzles scattered around. The main collectables and secrets of the lobby are getting the music discs, getting all of the armor sets, the hidden old lobby, and the mob head hunts to get the dragon's head.

'''Escaping the lobby'''

In older versions like PlayStation 3, escape was possible with an [[elytra]] or [[fishing rod]].{{info needed|how exactly?}} Note that only the winner of the previous round can access the elytra.

The modern lobby can also be escaped by going through the nether portal gate. Sometimes the nether gate blocks (and presumably the water gate blocks, but there is no evidence of those having this issue) can glitch out of existence. Then the player can use an elytra to go down the 1×1 hole, either in the 1×1 space in the area above the barrier, or in one of the 1×1 spaces used for the redstone under the map. However, there are [[barrier]] blocks that prevent the player from going any further down. Escaping the map this way can also give the player the "supersonic" achievement.

== Battle ==
{{main|Battle (mini game)}}
[[File:Battle Mini Game logo.png|thumb|300px|Battle mini game logo.]]
'''Battle''' is a mini game most similar to the popular "Hunger Games" mode on {{el|je}} servers, where players compete in a "last man standing" or "deathmatch" style game. Battle was added to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] on June 21, 2016.

== Tumble ==
{{main|Tumble}}
[[File:Tumble Mini Game logo.png|thumb|300px|Tumble mini game logo.]]
'''Tumble''' is a mini game most similar to the popular "[[Spleef]]" mode on {{el|je}} servers, where players aim to cause others to fall off of an arena by using [[snowball]]s, [[shovel]]s, or other items to mine the ground below them. Tumble was added to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] on August 30 and August 31, 2016.

== Glide ==
{{main|Glide (mini game)}}
[[File:Glide Mini Game logo.png|300px|thumb|Glide mini game logo.]]
'''Glide''' is a mini game where players maneuver through a track while wearing an [[elytra]], aiming to finish in the fastest time or score the most points by flying through colored rings. Glide was added to the [[Legacy Console Edition]] on March 28, 2017 (March 29, 2017 for ''Wii U Edition'').

== Build Off ==
'''Build Off''' was a planned mini game most similar to the popular "Build Battle" mode on {{JE}} servers, where players compete in themed building competitions and vote amongst themselves to select a winner. [[4J Studios]] hinted at the plan for the mini game at their panel at [[MINECON 2016]].<ref>https://youtu.be/hGUeli77sdI?t=3326</ref> The mode was likely cancelled for a variety of reasons, with one known issue being fairness according to former Mojang community manager [[Helen Zbihlyj]].<ref>https://youtu.be/ccB0-mPFplI?t=65</ref> Despite being cancelled, the mini game was partially implemented with calls for music cues, a leaderboard, and other features being present in the game's code and data with the namespace <code>MG04</code>.
