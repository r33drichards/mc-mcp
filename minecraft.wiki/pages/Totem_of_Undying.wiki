The '''totem of undying''' is an item that can prevent players or mobs from dying when they take fatal damage. It is dropped by [[evoker]]s, which spawn in [[woodland mansion]]s and [[raid]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Mob loot ===
Evokers always drop one totem of undying upon death, which is not affected by [[Looting]].
{{Drop sources|Totem of Undying}}

== Usage ==
[[File:Totem of Undying Animation.gif|alt=The totem animation in Java Edition.|thumb|Animation of the totem activating {{in|java}}.]]
[[File:Totem of Undying Bedrock Animation.gif|alt=The totem animation in Bedrock Edition.|thumb|Animation of the totem activating {{in|bedrock}}.]]
If a [[player]] or a [[mob]] is holding a totem of undying in the [[off-hand]] or main hand slot and receives otherwise fatal [[damage]], the totem prevents their [[death]]. The totem of undying must be held in the user's hand for it to work — it does not work if it is in the [[hotbar]], unless selected. Totems of undying prevent a [[game over]] in [[Hardcore]] mode in the same way they prevent a [[death]] in [[Easy]], [[Normal]], and [[Hard]] mode.

A totem can be used only once, and disappears when the effect is activated. It does not prevent death caused by [[void]] damage or the {{cmd|kill}} command. {{IN|java}}, it also does not prevent death caused by an arrow of [[Instant Damage|harming]] if the arrow kills the holder with just the [[arrow]]'s physical [[damage]], as the arrow's Instant Damage effect is applied after the totem has activated, effectively killing the player a second time. <ref>{{bug|MC-206307||Arrow of Harming bypasses Totem of Undying}}</ref>

When a totem of undying is activated, it restores {{hp|1}}, removes all existing status [[effect]]s and grants several positive status effects:

* [[Regeneration]] II ({{hp|1}} every 25 ticks, {{hp|2|notag=1}} × 0.4 per second) for 45 seconds (long enough to heal {{hp|36|notag=1}})
* [[Fire Resistance]] I for 40 seconds
* 5 seconds of [[Absorption]] II (providing {{hp|8|absorption=1|notag=1}})

When activated, multiple green and yellow particles are displayed around the player that held the totem. A [[Screen effects#Totem of Undying|screen effect]] also plays, showing the totem hovering in front of the [[player]]'s screen, similar to the animation seen when a player receives the [[Raid Omen]] effect or the [[Hero of the Village]] effect {{in|bedrock}}, or enters the same area as an [[elder guardian]].

Any [[mob]] that can hold a totem of undying (in a hand or in the mouth) is revived if killed while it is holding the totem. The totem functions exactly as it does with players, although undead mobs are not affected by the Regeneration effect.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* In the {{3ds}}, the totem of undying can be put in any hotbar slot to activate it, due to the lack of an [[Dual wield|off-hand slot]] in that version.
* Being able to obtain totems of undying in [[raid]]s without exploring [[woodland mansion]]s is considered a "massive game play design flaw" by Mojang.<ref>{{ytl|YRPlscod34Y|WOODLAND MANSION MYSTERY: Episode 3|Minecraft|Jan 6, 2023|t=4m20s}}</ref>
* Totems of undying are the only [[renewable resource]] that are made [[non-renewable]] in a [[difficulty]] other than Peaceful, as [[raid]]s do not last long enough to spawn [[evoker]]s in Easy difficulty.
