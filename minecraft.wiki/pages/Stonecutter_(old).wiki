The '''stonecutter''' is an unused decorative block. It was previously used to craft many stone items in ''[[Pocket Edition Alpha]]'' and the ''[[Windows 10 Edition Beta]]'' until its functionality was moved to the [[crafting table]]. It was later replaced by a new [[stonecutter]] in the [[Creative inventory]], but it still exists in old worlds which had one.

== Obtaining ==
Old stonecutters are only available by using [[Programs and editors|third-party software]] or by {{control|pick blocking}} an existing stonecutter in an old world. {{IN|new 3ds}}, they are available in the [[Creative inventory]].

=== Breaking ===
An old stonecutter requires a pickaxe to be mined, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a pickaxe, then the mining is slower and it drops nothing.

== Usage ==
Old stonecutters have no functional use. They can be used only for decoration.

== Issues ==
The old Stonecutter is an unsupported block and as such issues relating to them may not be fixed.

== Trivia == 
* The stonecutter was originally added to [[Pocket Edition]] due to a lack of space in the [[MATTIS|''Minecraft'' Advanced Touch Technology Interface System (MATTIS)]] crafting screen, prior to the redesign in [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha|v0.9.0 alpha]].
* The stonecutter has never been usable in {{el|3DS}}, as its first version was based on [[Pocket Edition v0.15.4 alpha]], two major releases after the removal of the stonecutter's functionality.
