{{Q|“Haunt Muskie”, if I remember correctly, an anagram for Hatsune Miku. Not entirely sure why anymore, but there you go. This song is very nostalgic for me, and I didn’t expect anyone to like it but just me. It turns out it is a little bit popular though. There was this fairly old video game I used to like. Some game where you solve puzzles of broken rollercoasters you have to fix. The music wasn’t particularly good, but the emotion it carried was something I always remembered. “Haunt Muskie” is what I remember that music to be.|C418|c418.org}}

{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Haunt muskie.ogg]]

"Haunt Muskie" is an upbeat, ambient, rhythmic track. It begins with the growing sound of echoing chimes and clarinets that quicken in pace. A reversed piano, accompanied by a synthesized accordion or similar instrument, begin to play up and down a scale, shortly before echoing and fading away, after which the main portion of the song starts. In some parts of the track, there is a whirlwind of synthesized sounds.

A heavily reverbed synthesized saxophone can be heard in the background throughout most of the piece. The piece concludes with an unexpectedly dissonant piano chord.
