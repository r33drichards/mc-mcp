The second version of '''[[Indev 0.31]]''' was released on '''December 23, 2009''' at 14:57 UTC.<ref>[[wordofnotch:296862046|Tree shadows, grass growing in slightly lit tiles, and torch tiles]] – The Word of Notch, December 23, 2009</ref> This version was not playable as it cached the previous version due to an incorrect [[al_version]]<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A8:59:24 <�08Notch�> it's still loading the cached version''" ... "''A9:00:02 <�08Notch�> there, it should load the new version now''"</ref> and two minutes later, it was reuploaded as [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-1459|Indev 0.31 20091223-1459]] to fix this.

* Emit [[light]].
* Their length is 13 pixels.
* If the [[player]] places a torch on the ground next to a wall, the torch attaches to the wall. 
* It is possible to create a flying torch by placing it on the ground, then by breaking the ground. 
** It's also possible for [[flower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and [[sapling]]s except that the torch stays in the air forever.

'''[[File:Lava JE6.png|32px]] [[Lava]]'''

* Do not decay in slightly lit tiles.

'''[[File:Water JE6.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Water JE4.png|32px]].
** Now has vertical lines flowing down it.{{verify|Must be the previous version.}}

'''[[File:Oak Leaves JE2.png|32px]] [[Leaves]] '''

** The grass under leaves is now [[dirt]] due to this.

== Trivia ==
* This version, same as [[Java Edition Classic 0.25 SURVIVAL TEST|0.25 SURVIVAL TEST]], was only available for 2 minutes, which makes them the shortest lived versions across all ''Minecraft'' editions.
