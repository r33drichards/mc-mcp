* Cracking animation only shows on one side of a block.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:59:28 <liq3> Notch: Cracks are only drawning on one face. :(''"</ref>
* Skeletons can enter 1-block high holes.{{verify|type=untestable}}
* Minecraft crashed upon loading for some users.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:00:12 <darkparadox> it says the game broke :\''"</ref>
* OpenGL invalid value bug.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:02:40 <Zarigani> OpenGL Exception: invalid value 1281''"</ref>
* Arrows do not deal damage after flying for more than 1 second.
* Players cannot damage themselves with arrows.
* Middle-clicking a block (pick-block) adds it into the player's [[inventory]] even when they do not yet have that block.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:47:58 <AnnihilatorBeta> if you middle mouse click on a block, you'll get it added to your inventory'' [...] ''P12:52:31 <Mikeh> I had 42 soil chunks, Middle clicked a mushroom and now I have 42 red mushrooms, Wooooo''"</ref>
** Only works on blocks that could previously be copied.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:53:08 <Snowman> You can't clone ore'' [...] ''P12:53:47 <setveen> Well notch, not really a problem with survivor, but when you middle click an admin block, nothing happenes''"</ref>
** Doing so replaces the block type of whatever you are holding, but not its amount.
* Placing a block at the build limit consumes the block, destroying it without placing anything.
* Looking at glass no longer makes glass textures directly behind it disappear.{{verify|type=untestable}}
* Walking on the very edge of a block causes the amount of sounds required to play to build up. Once the player stands on a block, those sounds play every 0.125 seconds.
