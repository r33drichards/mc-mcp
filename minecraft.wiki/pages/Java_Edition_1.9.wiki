*Hostile mobs with the appearance and some behavior of a solid purple block.
**Spawn only on the ground or walls of End cities when they first generate.
**Do not despawn in Peaceful difficulty, but also do not attack or target players.
*When attacking, it opens its shell on a spinning animation revealing the creature inhabiting.
**Looks like a little white cube with big eyes.
**Its attack consists of shooting projectiles with the appearance of white sea urchins.
***The projectiles chase the player until the player is out of range.
****It does not chase a [[spectator]].
***They can move along only one of the three grid axes at a time and on integer steps.
****This means they move through [[wikipedia:Taxicab geometry|taxicab geometry]].
***They can be knocked away by attacking them.

*It can be pushed by [[piston]]s and resists being placed on any position that isn't 3 integers (except if they are riding [[minecart]]s).

***Removing its support block.
***Pushing it into a non-air block (except [[piston head]]s).

*Generate on the outer islands of the End.
*Tree-like arrangements of the new [[chorus plant]] and [[chorus flower]] blocks.
*The whole structure is destroyed when the bottom-most block is destroyed, like [[cacti]].
*Can be farmed by planting the chorus fruit flowers that come from the top of the plants, on top of [[End stone]].
**Unlike cacti, chorus plants do not require the supporting block to be below it, but rather adjacent.
***This allows the structure to grow around obstacles, like other chorus trees.

''' [[File:EnvSprite end-islands.png|16px]] [[The End]] '''
[[File:The_End_-_Outer_Islands.png|thumb|width=189x189|End Islands]]

''' [[File:End gateway JE1.png|32px]] [[End Gateway]]s '''
*Generate in a radius around the main portal each time the dragon is killed.
**Up to 20 gateways can be generated this way.
**It is the usual way of traveling to the outer End islands, without having to build or fly all the way over there.
**It consists of the [[end gateway (block)|gateway block]] in the middle and two little bulbs of bedrock on the top and bottom.
***Since the bulbs of bedrock leave a one block slit on the horizontal plane, it is accessible only by throwing [[ender pearl]]s at it, or by riding [[pig]]s, [[boat]]s or [[minecart]]s.
***When used, it generates another gateway at the player's destination.
****The gateways are linked so the player has a way back.

''' [[File:End Ship JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[End Ship]] '''
*Sometimes generates up in the air next to the End city.
**Always appears to sail away from what appears to be a pier.
**Composed of many of the same materials as the End city.
*Generates with [[shulker]]s in it.
*Has a [[dragon head]], a [[brewing stand]] with [[potion]]s of Healing, a pair of [[elytra]] within an [[item frame]], and other various loot.

''' [[File:Igloo top.png|32px]] [[Igloo]]s '''
*Spawn randomly in [[ice plains]] and [[cold taiga]] (but not the hills variant).
**Spawning parameters are shared with [[desert pyramid]]s, [[jungle pyramid]]s, and [[witch hut]]s: the fact of a structure spawn is decided, then the biome determines which structure (if any) is spawned.
*An igloo contains: 9 [[white carpet]]s, 3 [[light gray carpet]]s, 2 blocks of [[ice]], a [[redstone torch]], [[furnace]], [[bed]] and a [[crafting table]].
*Some igloos have a [[stone brick]] basement, with a [[cauldron]], 2 [[red carpet]]s, a [[brewing stand]], 3 [[spruce stairs]], a [[cobweb]] and loot chest, along with a [[villager]] priest and [[zombie villager]] priest in [[iron bar]]s. A [[trapdoor]] with [[ladder]]s leads down, into the mossy brick basement, cracked and stone brick also available, with 2 torches.
**In the loot chest there is a [[golden apple]], hinting that the player needs to cure the zombie.
**Always spawns with a splash potion of weakness hinting the player to use these on the zombie to turn it into a villager, like the one next to it.
**The zombie has the <code>PersistenceRequired</code> tag which makes it not despawn.
**[[Silverfish]] spawn in some stone brick blocks.

''' [[File:EnvSprite superflat.png|16px]] [[Superflat]] '''
*New preset, "The Void"
**Spawns the player on a stone platform. No other terrain generates.
**The void is now a biome with an ID of 127.

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[File:AttackIndicatorHotbar.png|32px]] [[Combat]] '''
*New "attack strength" combat mechanic.
**A meter shows up after switching items or attacking.
***Damage done depends on the fullness of the meter, with a quadratic reduction (attack does 20%–100% of normal damage as the meter fills).
***Fills at different rates depending on the new attack speed attribute (see table on the changes to gameplay section for a complete list).
****The {{EffectLink|id=haste-be|Haste}} effect causes the meter to fill faster.
***Can be displayed next to the hotbar (left or right based on the player's main hand), under the crosshair or turned off.
****Looks like the icon for the {{EffectLink|id=strength-revision-1|Strength}} effect on the side of the hotbar, or like a dagger under the crosshair.
****This is controlled in video [[settings]].
**A cooldown animation is displayed of the [[tool]] slowly being lifted up, when first switching to it.
*Play sounds when attacked strongly, weakly, and parried.

''' [[Dual wield]]ing '''
*Players can now use both hands to perform different actions using the left and right mouse buttons.
**For example, if a player has a [[pickaxe]] in their main hand and a [[torch]] in their other hand, right clicking places the torch.
***This happens because a pickaxe lacks a right click use, and therefore the game tries to then treat the other item as if it's being right clicked.
****The player cannot click both buttons at the same time.
**This is achieved through an extra inventory slot called the "offhand" slot.
***Pressing {{key|F}} (by default) switches whatever item is selected in the hotbar with the item in the offhand (including no item).
***The offhand slot is displayed next to the hotbar when it's not empty (left for right-hand players and vice versa).
***It's available on all iterations of the [[inventory]] screen.
****It is distinguished by an outline of a shield like symbol.
***The player can hear an item switching sound, only for other players.
****The player cannot hear their own items switching.
*Only the main hand can be used for physical attacks.
*[[Bow]]s choose their arrow type based on the offhand.
**[[Arrow]]s in the offhand take priority over arrows in any other slot.
**If there are multiple arrow types and none in the offhand or selected hotbar slot, the arrow that is in the lowest numbered slot gets fired.
*The offhand model is invisible in first person view while it's empty.
*Some [[attribute]]s and [[enchantment]]s applies to the offhand item, if specified through a new tag.

''' [[Enchanting]] '''
*"Treasure" enchantments.
**Can be obtained only from [[chest loot]], [[fishing]], or [[trading]] for enchanted books.
*New "treasure" enchantment: [[Frost Walker]].
**Turns water into meltable ice which decays in multiple stages.
***Does not work on flowing water.
**Different tiers:
***Level I creates a circle of frosted ice around the player with a radius of 2 blocks.
***Each additional level adds 1 to that radius.
****Maximum radius is 16 blocks. Levels over 14 don't increase the range.
**Does not turn water into frosted ice if an entity is in that spot.
**The water must have an air block above in order to be turned into frosted ice.
**Works as long as the player is with in one block above a [[block]].
**Cannot be combined with Depth Strider enchantment.
*New "treasure" enchantment: [[Mending]].
**Any experience collected while holding the item repairs it instead of going to the experience bar.
***Mainhand, offhand, and armor slots all count as held.
***If multiple held items have the enchantment, one is be chosen at random for each experience orb collected.
***Repairs at a rate of 2 durability per experience.
***If the amount of repair needed is less than the value of the experience orb, the extra experience goes to the experience bar.

''' [[Status Effect]]s '''
*[[File:Glowing JE1.png|32px]] [[Glowing]]
**Received when players or mobs are hit by [[spectral arrow]]s.
**Makes player's outline glow, even through non-transparent blocks.
**Listed as a negative effect because it prevents players from hiding from other players.
**It becomes colored differently if the player is part of a team to match its team color.
*[[File:Levitation JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Levitation]]
**Received when the player or mobs is hit by [[shulker]] projectiles.
**Makes player involuntarily float high into the air.
***Can be used to get to higher places.
**Listed as a negative effect due to the potential to kill from [[fall damage]].
**Higher levels of Levitation result in faster floating.
***Effect levels 128-254 result in floating downward at a constant speed, with level 128 being the fastest and level 254 the slowest (one block per second).
***Effect level 255 disables falling and jumping altogether, to an effect not entirely unlike flying in Creative mode. Gaining or losing elevation is impossible without using pistons.
*[[File:Luck JE1.png|32px]] [[Luck]]
**Increases the luck attribute by 1 per level.
*[[File:bad Luck JE1.png|32px]] [[Bad Luck]]
**Decreases the luck attribute by 1 per level.

Instead of the deepest-nested "Riding" entity being the bottom-most in the stack of riding entities, the entity at the root of the data is at the bottom of the stack.
***For example, the armor stand in the following command is at the bottom of the stack while the cow and pig are at the same depth:
****<code>/summon ArmorStand ~ ~1 ~ {Passengers:[{id:"Cow"},{id:"Pig"}]}</code>
***One may also summon entities in stacks instead of the same height and with specific NBT tags attached to it:

***e.g. a deadly smoke that grows with each sacrifice: {{cmd|summon AreaEffectCloud ~ ~ ~ {Particle:"largesmoke",ReapplicationDelay:20,Radius:2f,&zwnj;RadiusPerTick:-0.002f,RadiusOnUse:0.5f,&zwnj;Duration:600000,DurationOnUse:0.0f,&zwnj;Effects:[{Id:7b,Duration:2400,Amplifier:10b<nowiki>}]}</nowiki> }}
*Entity: Zombie
**<code>VillagerProfession</code> (integer): tag for [[zombie villager]]s is used to determine what profession the [[zombie]] is represented as, as well as what profession it will become when cured.
**The appearance of the zombie matches the assigned profession.
**This tag is preserved during the villager's transformation to a zombie and vice versa.
***e.g. <code>/summon Zombie ~ ~1 ~ {IsVillager:1b,VillagerProfession:3}</code>
*Tile: [[Command block]]s
**<code>auto</code> (byte): When set to 1, the command block no longer requires a redstone signal in order to activate.
***When applied to an impulse mode block, its command activates only once, right after finishing writing the command.
***When applied to a repeat mode block, it constantly activates every tick.
***When applied to a chain mode block, it's always available to activate its signal when called.
***e.g. <code>/blockdata X Y Z {auto:1b}</code>
**<code>ConditionMet</code> (byte): States whether or not the command block behind the conditional command block was successful in output. Equals 1 if that block is successful and 0 if unsuccessful.

*Tile: Command blocks & [[note block]]s
**<code>powered</code> (byte): now have the "powered" tag associated with them, stating whether or not the block is currently receiving a redstone signal.
***They can be edited through block data so the block are activating even though no [[redstone]] is adjacent.
****Changing a command block through the "always active" toggle, effectively makes that command block to always have a 1 powered state, even when the block is updated.

**<code>Age</code> (long): Determines how long the [[End gateway]] has existed.
***When lower than 200, the block emits a purple beam.
****This is to easily locate the gateway when it first spawns.
***e.g. <code>/setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:end_gateway 0 replace {Age:180,ExactTeleport:1,ExitPortal:{X:1,Y:2,Z:3}}</code>

''' [[Scoreboard]] '''
*Added <code>/scoreboard players tag ...</code>
**The player can add and remove tags for any entity based on NBT tags of that entity/player.
***e.g. <code>/scoreboard players tag @a test {OnGround:0b}</code> adds the tag "test" to all players that are in the air.
**Tags can be accessed by using the parameters after the selector.
***e.g. <code>/give @a[tag=test] stone 1</code> gives 1 stone to all players that have the tag "test".
**The player can use <code>/scoreboard players tag <player> list</code> to see what tags are on an entity.
**Tags are stored in the <code>playerdata</code> file as strings, not in the scoreboard files.
***This means that any tag the player binds has to be bound to an existing online player or an existing entity.
***Unlike objectives, tags cannot be displayed anywhere on the [[HUD]] or [[inventory]].
****Only via the list sub-command can the player see which tags an entity has on the [[chat]].
****Through <code>CommandStats</code> it is possible to obtain the number of scoreboard tags an entity has via <code>QueryResult</code>.
*Added five new objective types: [[XP]], [[hunger]], [[Damage#Drowning|oxygen]], [[armor]] and level.
**"xp" can be used to track the players exact amount of XP points.
**"food" can be used to track the hunger level of the player (ranges from 0 to 20).
**"air" can be used to see how long the player has been underwater.
***Starts at 300 (out of water) and then decreases 1 per tick as long as the player´s head is underwater (resets when the player gets out of the water).
***The [[Water Breathing]] effect freezes the timer and the [[Respiration]] enchantment slows down the countdown from 300, each time more with each level.
**"armor" can be used to track the armor bar, which in turn tracks the total amount of protection of all currently worn armor pieces.
**"level" can be used to track the player's level directly, which is the number displayed above the experience bar.
***It is not directly correlated to the experience points, since increasing levels each time takes more xp than before.
***This could be tracked before, but it required some intermediate steps.
*Added <code>collisionRule</code> to the team options.
**It controls whether or not players can push other players and whether or not is team dependent.
**The modes are: <code>always</code>, <code>never</code>, <code>pushOtherTeam</code>, <code>pushOwnTeam</code>

''' [[Commands#Target selector arguments|Selector]] '''
*The gamemode selector <code>m</code> now supports both negation and literal gamemode values.

''' World selection '''
*Worlds now store (in the form of a [[data version]]) and display the version they were last played in, or display "unknown" if the version was older than snapshot [[15w32a]].
**The version number displays in red if it has been played in a newer version before.
*Now displays a thumbnail per world, showing a glimpse of the world (it takes a [[screenshot]] when the player has just created or opened it for the first time in the [[15w32b]] snapshot or higher).
**When the world hasn't been opened in snapshot [[15w32b]] or before, or if the game couldn't make a screenshot thumbnail, there is a gray-scale image.
**The thumbnail is saved in the world folder under <code>[[.minecraft]]/saves</code> with the name "icon.png".
***This allows the player to modify it easily and safely.
**An exclamation mark appears on top of the thumbnail, indicating that the world has not been played in the current [[snapshot]] yet.
***It displays the following message when hovered over: "Don't forget to backup this world before you load it in this snapshot."
***It also warns if a world was played in a newer version of ''Minecraft'', telling the player that the world may corrupt if they open it in an older version.
*The player can now click the play arrow on the thumbnail to open the world, just like the [[server list]].
*When edit world is clicked, the player has two new options:
**Reset icon: This allows the player to reset the thumbnail without going into the folder.
**Open folder: It opens the folder for the world, under <code>.minecraft</code>.

*New textures that now vary depending on what direction they are placed from, similar to [[dispenser]]s and [[piston]]s.
**It consists of a front, a back and a side texture (looks like arrows), so the orientation can be easily determined.

**The middle panel texture has a black outline.
**Impulse mode (orange): Command is run once on rising edge.
***Same behavior and color as previous versions.
**Repeat mode (blue): Command is run every game tick while powered.
***Like a [[minecart with command block]] but faster.
**Chain mode (green): Command is run whenever another command block pointing into it executes, and the chain command block itself is powered.
***The chain signal is forwarded until the blocks get out of loaded [[chunk]]s.
***The signal is independent of the powered state of any block in the chain, as well as the [[command]] (or lack thereof) inside.
**Each new mode has its own block id and is obtainable with {{cmd|give}} and {{control|pick block}}.
*Power received is now a data tag, allowing command blocks to have such a state under control, independent of any nearby [[redstone]] signal.
*"Unconditional" and "Conditional" toggle.

*Changed enchanted books rate in stronghold library chests, from groups of 1–5 with weight 2, to single books with weight 10.

''' [[Tree]]s '''
*Large oak trees now generate naturally in forest biomes again.

''' [[Village]]s '''
*Farms now include [[beetroot]] crops.

''' [[Witch hut]]s '''
*Now always generates with a witch.

=== Gameplay ===
''' [[Achievement]]s '''
*''Overpowered''
**Description changed from "Build" to "Eat" an enchanted golden apple.

''' [[Combat]] '''
*Added sound when critical hitting a player or mob.

''' [[Entities]] '''
*Most entities (except for [[item]]s, [[End crystal]]s, [[painting]]s and [[xp]] orbs) can now be pushed by other entities.
**The same class of entities are now "magnetic" to the bobber of the [[fishing rod]] and do not suffer knockback or take pseudo-damage from it.
**Entities bunched up in a 1×1 hole together no longer push away entities touching adjacent corners.

''' [[Enchanting]] '''
*Sharpness and Protection enchantments have been nerfed.
**Each Sharpness level now adds {{health|1}} damage to the base damage at level I and an additional 0.5 ({{health|2|notag=1}} × 0.25) for each additional level, down from a flat {{health|1.25}} per level.
**Protection enchantment bonuses are now linear instead of quadratic.
*Enchantments with max 1 level no longer display the level, e.g. "Infinity" rather than "Infinity I".
*When multiple pieces of [[Thorns]] armor are worn, one is now chosen at random instead of always using the "bottommost" piece.
*[[Silk Touch]] can no longer be applied to shears in Survival mode.
*Added sound when damaging players or mobs with Thorns.
*Added sound when knockback hitting a player or mob.

''' [[Experience]] '''
*Now is collected at the middle of player's model rather than at the head.
**This means that if a large amount of experience is collected, it no longer blocks the player's view.
*Blocks no longer drop XP when the <code>doTileDrops</code> gamerule is set to false.

''' [[Fishing]] '''
*The [[Lure]] enchantment no longer affects the chances of catching things, only the delay.
*Fished junk is less damaged (0%–90% durability remaining) while treasure is more damaged (0%–25% durability remaining).
*[[Ink sac]]s are now caught singly with weight 10 (formerly a stack of 10 with weight 1).
*[[Luck of the Sea]] and the new [[Luck]] effect affect fishing again, and effects stack. Each point increases the weight of treasure by 2, decreases the weight of fish by 1, and decreases the weight of junk by 2.

''' [[Hardcore]] '''
*Upon death the text "You Cannot Respawn In Hardcore Mode" is now removed, the player can now choose to respawn in [[Spectator]] mode rather than the world being deleted.

''' [[Health]] '''
*Health regenerates faster when [[saturation]] is not empty and the player is not hungry: {{hp|1}} per half-second versus {{hp|1}} per 4 seconds.
*Health regeneration increases exhaustion faster: now 4 exhaustion points (1 food point) per {{hp|1}} instead of 3 ({{frac|3|4}} food points).
*Sneaking now increases exhaustion by half as much as walking.

''' [[Jumping]] '''
*Player's jump height is increased from 1.125 blocks to 1.25 blocks.

''' [[Mob spawning]] '''
*Mobs can no longer spawn inside transparent full solid blocks containing [[glass]] and [[leaves]].
*Mobs can no longer spawn inside non-solid blocks containing [[rail]]s, [[powered rail]]s, [[detector rail]]s, or [[activator rail]]s, [[button]]s, [[tripwire hook]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, [[lever]]s, [[redstone torch]]es, [[redstone repeater]]s, [[redstone comparator]]s, and [[redstone dust]].
*[[Pack spawning]] is less likely to spawn the full pack, and less likely to spread them out.
**Previously, spawning a pack would start from the center three times and cumulatively adjust the coordinates four times by up to ±5 in X and Z, trying to spawn a mob each time, for a total of twelve spawn attempts (although it stops early if a full pack has spawned). Now that "four times" is a random number 1–4, meaning fewer total spawn attempts and less chance for the attempt coordinates to get far from the pack center.

''' [[Tool]]s '''
*Damage done by tools has been rebalanced:
**[[Axe]]s are much stronger but slower, [[sword]]s and [[pickaxe]]s are slightly weaker, but swords are faster than axes, [[shovel]]s are slightly stronger, [[hoe]]s are the fastest but also the weakest and now take durability damage when attacking.

''' [[Status effect]]s '''
*Status effect icons are now displayed on the HUD on the right hand corner instead of just in the inventory (similar to the [[Pocket Edition]]).
**They are ordered by the time of infliction from right to left.
**Positive effects are on the top row and negative effects on the bottom row.
**Effects that are about to run out blink.
***They blink faster when they are closer to running out and start fading away.
*Health Boost effect now shows multiple red hearts instead of the one similar to Regeneration.
*Absorption effect now shows a single red heart with a yellow outline around it.
*Nausea effect now stops instantly when cleared using milk or with commands.

''' [[Trading]] '''

**Can now be used on all entities.
*{{cmd|gamemode}}
**Now displays in chat the gamemode the player switched to.
*Tab-completed coordinate arguments now become tildes if no block is in focus.
*{{cmd|gamerule}}
**<code>doMobLoot</code> now drops player's XP when set to <code>false</code>.
**Setting a gamerule now reports the change: "Game rule &lt;gamerule&gt; has been updated to &lt;value&gt;."
*{{cmd|help}}
**Now randomly shows some texts which starts from "Searge says:", when run in a command block. Full list:
***"Searge says: Ask for help on twitter"
***"Searge says: Contact helpdesk for help"
***"Searge says: Have you tried turning it off and on again?"
***"Searge says: Oh my god, it's full of stats"
***"Searge says: Scoreboard deleted, commands blocked"
***"Searge says: Sorry, no help today"
***"Searge says: Yolo"
***"Searge says: /achievement take achievement.understandCommands @p"
***"Searge says: /deop @p"
***"Searge says: /kill @p[name=!Searge]"
***"Searge says: /testfornoob @p"
***"Searge says: /trigger warning"
*{{cmd|particle}}
**Now has a <code>player</code> parameter to control which players should view this particle instead of everyone in the viewing range of the particle.
**Now has a <code>params</code> parameter to specify particle parameters (for iconcrack_, …).
***<code>params</code> is can used to specify blocks and items for <code>blockdust</code>, <code>iconcrack</code>, and <code>blockcrack</code>.
***For <code>blockdust</code> and <code>blockcrack</code>, <code>params</code> parameter means <code>(id+(data*4096))</code>.
****For example, to specify pink wool for these particles, we need to add <code>24611</code> at the end of command as a <code>params</code>.
***For <code>iconcrack</code>, <code>params</code> has two values(<code>id data</code>).
****For example, <code>/particle iconcrack ~ ~ ~ 1 1 1 0.5 100 force @a 35 6</code> shows iconcrack particles of pink wool.
*{{cmd|playsound}}
**Now auto-completes itself when pressing TAB.
**Now has a <nowiki><code><source></code></nowiki> parameter to specify which sound source to be played as.

''' NBT format '''
*All entities
**Introduced a 1024 tag limit on the amount of strings an entity can have within the <code>Tags</code> tag.
***If it's surpassed, then it displays an error message saying: "Cannot add more than 1024 tags to an entity."
**<code>Riding</code> (compound): The "Riding" tag has been removed in favor of the new "Passengers" tag.
*All items
**<code>id</code> tag used to convert numerical IDs to name IDs has been removed.
**<code>/summon Creeper ~ ~1 ~ {Team:"RED"}</code> summons a creeper that is in the red team.
*<code>CustomNameVisible:true</code> makes the name tag on mobs show in the same way as on players.
*All mobs
**<code>HealF</code> tag was replaced by the <code>Health</code> tag, replacing the short-valued tag of that name.
***e.g. <code>/summon Creeper ~ ~1 ~ {Health:1.0f}</code>
**<code>Team</code> (string): Applied to mobs to make them be part of teams.
**<code>DropChances</code> and <code>Equipment</code> (list) tags are no longer used and are replaced with <code>ArmorItems</code>, <code>HandItems</code>, <code>ArmorDropChances</code> and <code>HandDropChances</code>.
*<code>BlockEntityTag</code> (compound): Now works on [[shield]]s in addition to [[banner]]s, to allow for customization.
**{{cmd|give @p minecraft:shield 1 0 {BlockEntityTag:{Base:15,Patterns:[{Color:0,Pattern:moj}]}<nowiki/>} }}
**If the player uses the {{cmd|give}} command to give themselves a shield, but doesn't specify the BlockEntityTag the shield starts with the default texture, but may change colors on entity updates to it if it has other tags.
*<code>EntityTag</code> (compound) and <code>id</code> (string): Can now be applied to [[spawn egg]]s.
**The resulting [[mob]] spawns with all of the tags.
***e.g. {{cmd|give @p minecraft:spawn_egg 1 0 {EntityTag:{id:"Creeper",Fuse:0}<nowiki/>} }}
*Entity: ThrownPotion
**The potion is a lingering potion if the stored item has an ID of <code>minecraft:lingering_potion</code>.
***e.g. {{cmd|summon ThrownPotion ~ ~1 ~ {Potion:{id:"minecraft:lingering_potion",tag:{Potion:"minecraft:swiftness"<nowiki>}}}</nowiki> }}
*Tile: Mob spawners
**<code>id</code> (string): Placed directly within the old <code>SpawnData</code> compound.
***It's essentially the same as <code>EntityId</code> except at a different depth.
***{{cmd|setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:mob_spawner 0 replace {SpawnData:{id:"Creeper"}<nowiki/>} }}
**<code>Entity</code> (compound): The original <code>Properties</code> tag has been replaced by the <code>Entity</code> tag. As well, to define which entity is used, the <code>id</code> tag within "Entity" states the ID.
***{{cmd|setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:mob_spawner 0 replace {SpawnPotentials:[{Weight:1,Entity:{id:"Skeleton"}<nowiki/>}]} }}
**Removed the <code>Type</code> and <code>Properties</code> tags, deprecated the <code>EntityId</code> tag
*Tile: Sign
**In order for a sign to accept text, all 4 tags ("Text1", "Text2", "Text3", and "Text4") must exist.
***e.g. {{cmd|setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:standing_sign 0 replace {Text1:"[\"1\"]",Text2:"[\"2\"]",Text3:"[\"3\"]",Text4:"[\"4\"]"} }}
*<code>CommandStats</code> can be used to obtain the number of "scoreboard tags" an entity has via <code>QueryResult</code>
**e.g. {{cmd|scoreboard players tag <''player''> list}} returns the number of scoreboard tags applied to the target.
***If the target previously had 3 tags added, a score of "3" is returned upon running this command.
*Fireball, DragonFireball, SmallFireball and WitherSkull entities
**<code>direction</code> (list/double): Now requires exactly 3 internal Doubles to be listed in order for the entity to be summoned.
**<code>power</code> (list): New list of 3 Doubles that determine which direction to shoot in. Unlike "direction" however, the motion does not consider air resistance, causing the fireball to endlessly move in that specified direction. <code>direction</code> is still required, but can be set to 0.
***<code>/summon Fireball ~ ~1 ~ {power:[0.0,-0.01,0.0],direction:[0.0,0.0,0.0]}</code>
*Entity: ArmorStand
**<code>DisabledSlots</code> (integer): Original values have changed in nature
***1 << slot = disables all interaction
***1 << (slot + 8) = disables removing
***1 << (slot + 16) = disables placing

''' [[Commands#Target selector arguments|Selector]] '''
*The radius selector <code>r</code> now detects based on the position of the entity.
**This means that <code>r=0</code> selects only entities at the exact same position.

=== General ===
* Non-player entities can no longer regenerate the obsidian platform when entering an End portal.
* A non-player entity going through a nether portal no longer causes a return portal to generate on the other side if none exists already.

*Proper support for multiple bosses' health bars, so they can show at the same time without obstructing each other.

''' [[Credits]] '''
*[[Thomas Guimbretière]] is now credited, under "Game design, programming and graphics".
*Samuel Åberg is now credited, under "Music and sound".
*[[Erik Broes]] is now credited under "Game design, programming and graphics", rather than "Programming".

*Rearranged the survival inventory and the Creative "survival tab" to accommodate for the new offhand slot.
*Unified the orientation of many items in the inventory.

''' [[Title screen]] '''
*Now indicates whether the current version is a snapshot in the bottom left.
**e.g. <code>Minecraft 16w05b/snapshot</code>

''' [[Model]]s: '''
*Different models/textures can be used for each different damage value, item states, and whether the item is held in a different hand.
**This works on [[compass]]es, [[clock]]s, and anything that can have a [[durability]] bar.
**It also contains additional tags for [[bow]]s and [[fishing rod]]s.
*Models can be put together based on block state attributes, such as fences.
**As a result, the vanilla set of block models has been reduced by almost 300.
*Block model JSON is now strict, meaning that comments and quote-less identifiers are not allowed.
*<code>display</code> tag defaults have changed, and the <code>thirdperson</code> and <code>firstperson</code> tags were replaced with <code>thirdperson_righthand</code>, <code>thirdperson_lefthand</code>, <code>firstperson_righthand</code>, and <code>firstperson_lefthand</code>.
*<code>parent</code> and <code>elements</code> tags can coexist now, but the top level elements tag overwrites all former ones.

''' [[Options]] '''
*Removed the ''Super Secret Settings'' button and the ''Alternate Blocks'' toggle from video settings.
*Twitch integration (along with the ''Broadcast Settings'' section in video settings) is removed.

''' Performance '''
*Optimized memory usage when connected to servers.
*Optimized mob AI (specially pathfinding).
*Optimized block ticking.
*Improved chunk generation, loading and sending.
**Improved rendering "by building a chunk only once where it was rebuilt up to 5 times in worst case".
*[[Particles]] are no longer entities, reducing memory usage.
**Throwing an [[egg]] or a [[snowball]] at an entity, produces particles.
*[[Redstone]] and [[piston]] contraptions visibly update much faster.
*Better performance on older computers.
*Riding entities such as [[boat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[minecart]]s and [[saddle]]d [[pig]]s, are now run by the client instead by the server.

''' [[Pick block]] '''
*In [[Survival]], it now works on items outside the hotbar but inside the player's [[inventory]].
*In [[Creative]], it respects the tags of items in [[item frame]]s while holding {{key|Ctrl}}.

''' [[Player]] '''
*When crouching, players are 1.65 blocks tall (versus 1.8 blocks normally).
*When flying with elytra, players are now 0.6 blocks tall.

''' [[Resource pack]]s '''
{{Resource pack format/value|2}}

''' [[Skin]]s '''
*Overlay layers (hat, jacket, sleeves, and pants) correctly render semitransparent pixels, instead of only fully opaque or only fully transparent pixels.

''' [[sounds.json#Sound events|Sound events]] '''
*Sound events were renamed.

''' [[Spectator]] mode '''
*A spectator is no longer able to open a chest where the loot has not been generated yet.
**They are given the message: "Unable to open. Loot not generated yet."

* Before the introduction of [[game drop]]s, this update had the longest wait for a major update to {{JE}}, with 545 days having elapsed since the release of [[Java Edition 1.8]] on September 2, 2014.
