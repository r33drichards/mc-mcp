The '''Minecraft Forum''' is a community-driven [[wikipedia:Internet forum|forum]] for ''Minecraft''. It was created on June 16, 2009 by community member [[User:citricsquid|citricsquid]] and has continued to be operated by the community, with [[Mojang Studios]] having no involvement in day-to-day operations (although some Mojang Studios employees have accounts on the site). The forums were launched on FluxBB, and upgraded to phpBB in 2010. They also ran on IP.Board from 2011-2013, <ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110530084810/http://www.minecraftforum.net/</ref> before finally switching to a forum software called Cobalt, which was developed in-house by Curse.

In September 2010, [[Redstone Wire Ltd]]. was formed<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160407065746/http://rmbls.net/post/16577257153/history-of-minecraftforumnet-and</ref> to manage the site, and on November 15, 2010, the site was acquired by Curse,<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/forum-announcements/796489-curse</ref><ref>https://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/07393581</ref> who owned and operated the site until it was acquired by MagicFind in June 2019. 

The forum serves as a hub for the ''Minecraft'' community with game [[mods|modifications]], custom maps, [[server]]s and [[resource pack]]s all being shared. Registration to the site is free and anyone with or without a ''Minecraft'' account is allowed to use the site. Forum administration is managed by [[User:citricsquid|citricsquid]] and [[User:PuyoDead|PuyoDead]], as well as the forum moderation team is made up of over 100<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/674656-staff-list/</ref> volunteers.

The site front page includes news, videos, interviews, contests and articles, relating to ''Minecraft'', Mojang Studios and the ''Minecraft'' community in general. The front-page news is managed by [[user:Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] with videos from the [https://www.youtube.com/user/mcspotlights MCSpotlights YouTube Channel] and the [https://www.youtube.com/user/curseentertainment Curse YouTube channel].

On May 20, 2019, citricsquid announced that the forums would become read-only on June 16, 2019.<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/news/60727-important-minecraft-forum-archive-announcement</ref> However, on June 12, 2019, the archival was cancelled and the site ownership was transferred to a different company.<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/news/60728-a-new-and-exciting-beginning</ref>
