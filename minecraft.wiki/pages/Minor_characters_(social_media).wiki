=== Baba Yaga ===
{{Wikipedia|Baba Yaga}} is a mythological figure, said to lure children into a house with bird feet and eats them whole. Within the show, there is a recurring plot thread where [[M.A.R.I.L.L.A.]] claims to have been turned into a [[computer]] by her. Initially, she brings her up while talking about the [[witch]] mob, and shows an image of her apparently so rancid it had to be censored. Later, while discussing [[spectator mode]], she flies into Baba Yaga's house and suffers a mental breakdown.<ref>{{ytl|sriHoJkuDUw|The Last Ten Years: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft|Minecraft|May 31, 2019|t=}}</ref> In another episode, she offhandedly mentions "a witch" offering her three magic beans in return for digital immortality.<ref>{{ytl|2zrD0ijjbUk|Passive & Neutral Mobs: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft @ 0:11|Minecraft|August 30, 2019|t=11s}}</ref>

=== Squid Overlords ===
[[File:TLTY Emblem.jpeg|thumb|Logo for the government.]]
In the second episode of the show, [[The Last Ten Years]], M.A.R.I.L.L.A. declared 2016 was a "slightly bad year" for Minecraft, citing a war between humanity and [[Squid|squids]]. Although quickly clarifying that this hadn't happened until 2019, she believed that they took over incredibly quickly, claiming the entirety of all seven continents and redesigning monuments such as {{Wikipedia|Mount Rushmore}} in their image.{{-}}

=== Variation 3582 ===
In the third episode of the show, M.A.R.I.L.LA. went into the introduction of [[Tropical Fish|tropical fish]], designed to "add color to the oceans without pouring paint into it!" She spoke greatly of the 3,853rd variation of the mob, a Dottyback. However, she then proceeded to dub the 3,852nd variation "the worst," in spite of them looking near identical save for two pixels. This brings the fish to tears.

In the fifth episode, the fish made a cameo reappearance, during a sequence where M.A.R.I.L.L.A. is overwhelmed by YouTube comments. Its comment is a request to make a video entitled "10 Scenes You Thought Would Be Easy to Capture In-Game but Were Actually An Absolute Nightmare."

=== Jomang Studios Founder ===
Appearing in [[DID THE CRAFTER BREAK/FIX CRAFTING?]], the Founder is the main antagonist of the second series, tricking Narrator into infiltrating Mojang Studios. Founding [[Jomang Studios]], they intend to plagiarize ''[[Minecraft]]'' as part of a scheme to create {{Wikipedia|Non-fungible token|non-fungible tokens}}.

=== Kawaii Mobs ===
[[File:Kawaii Mobs.jpeg|left|thumb|width=264x264|The three "Kawaii" mobs]]
During ''Adding a New Mob'', three "kawaii" mobs appear, with non-pixelated, 2D mouths and hearts for eyes. They consist of a baby [[Polar Bear|polar bear]], a baby [[turtle]], and a [[pig]]. When they appear, a song about friendship plays from an unknown singer, which they dance to. This occurrence brings great pain to [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]], who pleads for it to stop. When it does, their eyes turn into puppy dog eyes with a sad frown, followed by angle bracket eyes and vibrating mouths as they cry rainbows.

=== Sweet Berry Bush and Susan ===
[[File:Sweet Berry Bush Age 2 JE1 BE1.png|right|frameless|width=201x201]]
During [[Adding a New Mob|''Adding a New Mob'']], a sentient [[Sweet Berries|sweet berry bush]] appears, and is established to have married a woman named Susan. Fearing for its life, the bush asks for someone to tell their wife they love her, only for a nearby chicken to tell them that she left ten years ago. When a fox swipes the berries from the bush, its last words are "SUUUUUSAAAN!"

=== Iron Golem and Allay ===
Appearing in [[Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes#Finale: The End of Minecraft|The End of Minecraft]], the [[Iron Golem|iron golem]] and [[allay]] are two characters appearing inside a jail cell outside of a pillager outpost. When asked by MARILLA what they were "in for," the allay replied tax evasion. Narrator then asked how the iron golem, made of [[metal]], can't break out of a [[wooden]] cage, only responding with a request to remain silent. Similarly, the cage also has an exposed roof, and it is later revealed the [[Iron Door|iron door]] keeping them trapped was "unlocked."

=== Two Endermen in a Trench Coat ===
Appearing in [[Desert of Doom]], Two Endermen in a Trench Coat are two [[Enderman|endermen]] wearing a trench coat, attempting to get inside of [[Mobboland]]. They are denied entry for still being too short, which is ironic because endermen are known for their height.

=== Audience members ===
[[File:Editor's descent.mp4|thumb|width=203x203|Several of the audience members clapping.]]
Throughout the series, several audience members appear, typically the same few. They make a variety of appearances, either reacting or comically unfazed by the events transpiring around them.{{-}}

=== Mary McCorstin ===
[[File:Mary McCorstin.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Mary beside a telephone.]]
During ''CANT.STOP.BRUSHING'', a mother of four children is briefly interviewed, named Mary McCorstin. She relays her troubles dealing with brushing teeth, claiming that "the brushing never stops," only to have her concerns dismissed by [[Randy Peters]].{{-}}

=== Monologue characters ===
{{Expand section}}
Throughout passages written by the [[Editor (character)|editor]], many characters are mentioned.

=== Mother and daughter ===
[[File:Cringe scrub griefer.mp4|thumb|width=203x203|The two characters' combined screentime.]]
At the beginning of [[CANT.STOP.BRUSHING]], a mother and daughter appear, with a simple situation being established. The mother is having difficulty getting her daughter to brush her teeth, leading to her being labeled cringe and yelled at. The solution to this problem is shown to be buying [[Colgate]] products.{{-}}

== Miscellaneous ==

=== AI Adventurers ===
During the [[AI Adventurers]] series, several animals and creatures not previously seen in the franchise make appearances. [[Building the Basics]] features the appearance of a bulldog, poodle, whale, and two distinct species of tiger. [[Solving Problems with AI]] has a robotic mini-submarine that can identify [[tropical fish]] from a glance.

=== Coworkers ===
During the [[Ice Cube Claims Adjuster]] series, several minor contemporaries of Ice Cube can be seen. In the background of the first episode, one person can be seen raising their hands in the background, while another passes by in [[Going AFK]]. Throughout several episodes, a framed picture of an employee named Greg appears, represented by a photo of [[Jens Bergensten]]. He is described as working in finance, which is exactly below the [[Ice Cubicle]], and apparently soft enough to safely land on top of.

=== Claimants ===
During the [[Ice Cube Claims Adjuster]] series, multiple players appear with problems, which [[Ice Cube]] consistently dismisses. In [[Sleeping in the Nether]], one of them lost their diamonds from a bed exploding in the Nether. This player used a unique persona made using the [[Character Creator]]. In [[Going AFK]], a player using [[Zuri]] was killed by a [[phantom]] while away from the game, while in [[Fell off a Happy Ghast]], a player using [[Noor]] fell off a [[happy ghast]]. In [[Dug Straight Down]], a player named therealSocksfor1 tried to dig straight down. 

As shown by a sticky note on [[Larry.exe]], Ice Cube is specifically trying to deny these players for help.
