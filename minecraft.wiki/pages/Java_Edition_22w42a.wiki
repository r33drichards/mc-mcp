'''22w42a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.3]], released on October 19, 2022,<ref>{{snap|22w42a|October 19, 2022}}</ref> which added the first scheduled features for [[Java Edition 1.20|1.20]] and made [[bundle]]s available again in the respective built-in [[Experiments|experimental data packs]], and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* Added a subsection called <code>chat_type</code>.
* Added a subsection called <code>datapacks</code>.
** Contains vanilla data packs that enable certain features.
* The vanilla world generation data pack is now visible within the game's jar.
** This means categories such as <code>dimension_type</code> and <code>worldgen</code> are now visible, along with their contents.

'''Feature flags'''
* Option to enable or disable certain groups of game elements (i.e. blocks, entities, and items).
** Enabled via [[data pack]]s.
*** New pack metadata section called <code>features</code>, containing enabled feature flags in list named <code>enabled</code>.
* Game elements controlled by feature flags are hardcoded and stored per world.
* Built-in data packs now enable features and provide other things such as associated recipes and advancements.
* Feature flags can affect:
** Blocks
*** Disabled blocks are not recognized by commands, won't spawn in structures, won't be loaded as part of entities, and can't be interacted with by players.
** Entities
*** Disabled entities are not recognized by commands, don't spawn or load in the world, and spawn eggs for disabled entities don't function.
** Items
*** Disabled items are not recognized by commands, are hidden from the creative menu, can't be used by players for interacting or attacking, and recipes and loot tables cannot create disabled items.

'''[[Options]]'''
* Added a new "Panorama Scroll Speed" accessibility option.

'''<samp>[[server.properties]]</samp>'''
* Added <code>initial-enabled-packs</code> and <code>initial-disabled-packs</code>.
** Allows for which packs to be selected to load during world creation.
** <code>initial-enabled-packs</code> contains a list of packs to be enabled (feature packs need to be explicitly enabled).
** <code>initial-disabled-packs</code> contains a list of packs that are not enabled automatically.
*** Data packs added after world creation are disabled if they require features that are not enabled for the loaded world.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Stronghold]]'''
* The placement code has been changed to be more efficient, causing stronghold positions to shift.
** They are still placed in concentric rings, but their positions in the rings may change by a few degrees.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The advancement "Birthday Song" is now a regular advancement instead of a challenge.

'''[[Chat]]'''
* Removed chat preview.

* The ordering of tabs and the contents in the creative inventory have been tweaked to make the experience of finding relevant blocks and items easier.
** Blocks and items have been moved into categories that fit them better.
** Blocks are now ordered by their material as much as possible.
*** For example, all oak blocks and variants are now next to each other.
** Some items can now be found in more than one tab.
** Various tabs have been renamed or collapsed into others.
*** The new tabs for blocks are "Building Blocks", "Nature Blocks", "Functional Blocks" and "Redstone Blocks".
*** The new tabs for items are "Tools & Utilities", "Combat", "Consumables", "Crafting" and "Spawn Eggs".
** The search tab now lists items sequentially grouped by the other tabs.
*** For example, items found in building blocks always appear before items in redstone blocks.
* Petrified oak slab has been removed from the creative inventory, but can still be accessed through commands.

'''Protocol'''
* The network protocol now supports adding player entities to the world without being added to the 'tab' player list.
* Servers can now lazily distribute players' profile public keys along with their first chat packet.

*** Signs that are placed in this way break when the supporting block is removed.
** Attached to the solid side of a block.

The chain is on parallel sides of the sign, connected to the stick. Signs in this configuration can be placed in 4 cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).
*** Signs that are placed in this way remain hanging in the air when the supporting block is removed.
* Just like regular [[sign]]s, the text on the hanging signs is on the front, and the back side is blank.
* Just like regular signs, the text on the hanging signs can be dyed.
* Just like regular signs, hanging signs can be waterlogged.
