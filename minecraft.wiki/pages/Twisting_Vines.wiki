'''Twisting vines''' are climbable upward-growing vegetation blocks found in [[the Nether]] in [[warped forest]]s. 

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Twisting vines can be broken instantly using any tool. They have a 33% chance to drop a single twisting vine when broken, increased to 55% with [[Fortune]] I, 77% with Fortune II, and 100% with Fortune III. They always drop a single twisting vine when broken with [[shears]] or with a tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]].  Any segments left unsupported from below break with a 33% drop chance, regardless of tool used. Accordingly, twisting vines are best harvested from the top.

=== Natural generation ===
Twisting vines only generate naturally in the [[warped forest]] biome, either on the ground or on warped [[huge fungus]] structures.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
Just like [[weeping vines]], twisting vines have a 10% chance of growing one [[block]] each random [[tick]]. Unlike weeping vines, however, twisting vines grow upward. At default random tick speed, each [[fungus]] grows approximately every {{convert|13653|ticks|minutes}}. Twisting vines stop growing when the block reaches an {{cd|age}} block state of 25, or when there is no space to grow into.

Using [[bone meal]] on a block of twisting vines causes it to grow immediately. Using [[bone meal]] on [[warped nylium]] also provides a small chance of generating 1-block tall twisting vines on nearby nylium and netherrack.

== Usage ==
Twisting vines can be placed on any block except for transparent blocks (e.g. leaves and fences). They can be used to prevent fall damage, similarly to a water bucket.

Twisting cease growing naturally if [[shears]] are {{control|used}} on the tip.

=== Climbing ===
Twisting vines can be climbed by standing inside and holding the jump key. If there is a solid block behind the twisting vines, the walk forward key can also be used.

=== Composting ===
Twisting vines have a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1 if placed in a [[composter]].
