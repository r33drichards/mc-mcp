<!-- No longer accurate with 1.13 -->The '''villages.dat''' file located in the data folder of every Minecraft level is used to store information about the [[villages]] in the level. It is stored as a GZip'd NBT file.

Additional files '''villages_nether.dat''' and '''villages_end.dat''' are stored, allowing for villages in other [[dimension]]s should the [[player]] build them.

Villages are "forgotten" and not saved in this file when their [[chunk]]s are unloaded.
