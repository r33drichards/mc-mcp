== Water test (May 18, 2009) ==

'''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110302000432/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/109669296/ok-multiplayer-was-boring-but-heres-water Word of Notch post]''', '''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwgXo3LYKaU YouTube video (reupload)]'''
* '''Additions'''
** [[Bedrock]]
*** Unobtainable to the [[player]].
*** Cannot be broken, placed against or otherwise selected.
*** Surrounds the map on all four sides two blocks below ocean level, and also the bottom of the world.
** [[Water]]
*** It was originally opaque, rendered as a full block and on the same layer as all other blocks (meaning it had shadows).
*** The player can swim in it, but mobs move under it at full speed. Swimming underwater was fast at first, as seen in the video. 
*** Spreads from the world border on world generation to fill any empty space next to it. 
** World border
*** An infinite ocean now surrounds the map, making it impossible to fall off the world. 
** Pressing F now cycles between four levels of render distance. 
** Pressing N generates a new level, but without a level generation screen. Mobs also don't get reset on level reset. 
* '''Changes'''
** New terrain generator
*** Terrain is more messy, with more bumps visible on the surface.
*** Terrain now generates in islands. 
*** No blocks can generate on ocean level, the terrain is always one block above it.
*** Dirt with access to sunlight will not become grass block upon world generation if below ocean level.

=== Trivia ===
* Water was made transparent before the release of [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.12a|0.0.12a]]. To do this, Notch had to make it render on a new layer, which is why it lost its shadows. Water would stay without shadows until the release of [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.14a 08|0.0.14a_08]]. 
* The terrain generation files for this version can be found in the 0.0.13a jar provided in the launcher. When ported to [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.13a|0.0.13a]], it is possible to see how the terrain worked. There are variables to enable/disable the water spreading from the borders, the uniform dirt layer and blocks being able to generate on ocean level.

== Lava test (May 19, 2009) ==
{{Unreleased version|section=1}}
'''[https://web.archive.org/web/20200217031836/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/110143855/lava-it-flows-its-very-uncommon-on-the-surface Word of Notch post]'''
[[File:Classic 0.0.12a.jpg|thumb|right]]

* [[Lava]]
** Translucent.
** Added shortly before the full release of [[Java Edition Classic 0.0.12a|0.0.12a]], as the screenshot of it posted on Notch's blog is from May 19th, 2009. 
* [[Water]]
** Is now translucent and no longer renders as a full block.
