'''16w41a''' is the eleventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on October 13, 2016<ref name=blogpost_16w41a>https://www.mojang.com/2016/10/minecraft-snapshot-16w41a/</ref> mainly to fix a few bugs with [[observer]]s and [[piston]]s.

== Changes ==
'''[[Item durability]] bar'''
* The colors of the durability bar, which is displayed on damaged items in the [[hotbar]] and inventories, have been changed.

** Also, the background of the durability bar is now completely black, where it used to be transparent.

'''[[Elytra]]'''
* Now have their own sound when equipped.

'''[[Llama]]s'''
