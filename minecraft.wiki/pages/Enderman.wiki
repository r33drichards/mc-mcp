An '''enderman''' is a tall [[neutral mob]] found in all three [[dimension]]s that drops [[ender pearl]]s. It becomes hostile to [[player]]s that damage it or look directly at its face, using its arms to attack. Endermen [[Teleportation|teleport]] erratically, as well as away from dangers such as [[lava]], [[projectile]]s, and [[water]]. They also occasionally pick up and move certain [[block]]s.

== Spawning ==
[[File:Purpleenderman.png|thumb|right|An enderman in the Overworld.]]
Endermen can spawn on any solid surface that has at least three empty spaces above, at a [[light level]] of 0 in the [[Overworld]] and [[the End]], or a light level of 7 or less in [[the Nether]]. They are the only mobs that spawn naturally in all three dimensions.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Overworld ===
Endermen spawn uncommonly in all [[Overworld]] biomes except [[mushroom fields]] and [[deep dark]]. {{IN|Bedrock}}, endermen also do not spawn in [[river]]s, [[frozen river]]s, and [[snowy plains]]. They spawn in groups of up to four {{in|je}} or up to two {{in|be}}.

=== Nether ===
Endermen spawn in groups of four {{in|je}} or individually {{in|be}}, rarely in [[soul sand valley]]s, uncommonly in [[Nether wastes]], and most commonly in [[warped forest]]s.

=== End ===
Endermen spawn commonly in groups of four anywhere in the End dimension.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Ender Pearl|quantity=0-1|lootingquantity=0-1}}
}}
* {{xp|5}} when killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]].
* 100% chance of dropping the block that it is holding (see {{slink||Moving blocks}} for more information).

== Behavior ==
Endermen can step up one full block without having to jump.

==== Provoking ====
An enderman is passive until provoked. An enderman is provoked when

* A [[player]] or other mob attacks it.
* A player within 64 blocks looks at its eyes for 5 [[game tick]]s ({{frac|1|4}} second)<ref>{{bug|MC-258644|||WAI}}</ref> if the view is not obstructed by any solid block (including transparent blocks), or the player isn't wearing a [[carved pumpkin]] on the head.<!-- Most distance values in the behavior section are a spherical radius, unless specified otherwise. -->
** Looking anywhere at the head aggravates it, including the back of the head.
** Looking at its upper legs at further distance aggravates it.
* It can see an [[endermite]] within 64 blocks of it.

{{IN|je}}, the provocation works similar to a mob's [[detection range]], its range reducing if the player is [[sneaking]] or under the [[Invisibility]] [[effect]].

When provoked, an enderman opens its mouth and makes loud screaming noises. A provoked enderman also starts shaking {{in|je}}.

==== Staring ====
{{IN|je}}, staring an aggravated enderman in the eyes from within 16 blocks of it paralyzes it, causing it to stop moving as long as the player maintains eye contact. The enderman still displays aggravated behavior, shaking and screaming with its mouth open, and resumes its chase should the player stop looking at it. Moving within four blocks of a paralyzed enderman causes it to teleport away. Unlike the distance to provoke an enderman, the minimum and maximum paralyzing distances are not affected by sneaking or invisibility.

==== Attacking ====
An enderman runs toward the back of the player to attack, although it ceases if hit by another player or mob.<ref>{{tweet|notch|113639625364480001|Did some tweaks to the Endermen, then ran home. Working on Minecraft again is so much fun!|September 13, 2011}}</ref>{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}}{{Verify|edition=Bedrock}} An aggravated enderman runs faster than the normal movement speed and, if the player is at least 16 blocks away from the enderman, often teleports up to 19 blocks horizontally and 22 blocks vertically toward the location of its target every 1.5 to 2 seconds.{{Needs testing|Is the teleportation frequency, maximum teleport distance, and minimum distance required for an attacking teleport the same?|bedrock=1}} An enderman is not provoked by a player viewing it through a transparent block or while wearing a [[carved pumpkin]].

An aggravated enderman pursues the player until it is either killed or distracted by external elements, such as rain or fire.{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}}{{Needs testing|Do hazards actually make them lose their target, or do they just teleport?|bedrock=1}} They do not take damage from sunlight like [[undead]] mobs, but when at a sufficient light level under the sky during the day{{Only|Java}} or at any light level{{Only|Bedrock}} they teleport randomly, typically ending up in caves (although certain non-full blocks, such as [[soul sand]] and [[mud]], also register as "dark" when the enderman is standing in them).

An enderman tracks targeted mobs until they're out of sight, too far away, or in another dimension. If the target is a player, the enderman tracks the player through walls. {{IN|je}}, the enderman continues to chase the player for as long as it is loaded, regardless of the distance or dimension of the targeted player.

{{IN|be}}, the enderman loses interest after enough time{{More info|How much time?}} of non-interaction with the player. In ''Java Edition'', if the internal sky light is sufficient, the enderman attempts to disengage approximately every 20 to 30 seconds. If it does not regain sight of its target within up to 40 seconds,<!-- 40-second limit based on the maximum time AngerTime can reach naturally. --> or if it is attacked by something else, then it disengages from the player unless provoked again.

Endermen are also aggressive towards [[endermite]]s and will attack them if they are 64 blocks away or less.

==== Water ====
Endermen can be damaged by [[rain]], [[water]], [[Water Bottle|splash water bottles]], and, {{in|be}}, water-filled [[cauldrons]]. When contacting any one of these, endermen take {{Health|1}} damage. In rain, endermen continuously teleport until they find a dry spot or die.

==== Projectiles ====
Endermen are immune to most projectiles, as they teleport away before being hit.<ref>{{bug|MC-109147}}</ref>  

If an enderman is somehow unable to teleport, throwables like [[snowball]]s are absorbed, while arrows and tridents are bounced {{in|je}} and pass right through {{in|be}} (but effects are still applied from tipped arrows).

Endermen are not immune to the [[warden]]'s sonic boom ranged attack.

=== Teleportation ===
Endermen teleport when dodging projectiles, when chasing a target, and when taking damage from ''natural sources'', suffocation, and potion effects. They also teleport when hit by a player or mob,{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}} when paralyzed and within four blocks of their target,{{Only|Java|short=1}} randomly at any time and light level,{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}} and when in places with a [[sky light]] of 15 and an [[internal sky light]] of 12 and not attacking or chasing a target.{{Only|Java|short=1}} 

Endermen play a sound exclusively at the teleportation destination.<ref>{{bug|MC-94481}}</ref>

Each teleportation attempt caused by taking damage, being paralyzed,{{Only|Java|short=1}} a projectile, or random teleportation attempt chooses a random destination 32 blocks along each axis (i.e. a 64×64×64 cube centered on the current position).

When attacking, an enderman may teleport up to 19 blocks horizontally and 22 blocks vertically to close the distance on a target. Teleportation attempts made to attack a target choose a random destination within a 9×11×9{{Verify|May be 10×12×10}} rectangular prism centered on a point 16 blocks horizontally and 17 blocks vertically toward its target. If the target is within those ranges, the destination is centered on the target's XZ and/or Y coordinates instead.{{Needs testing|Are these values the same on Bedrock Edition?|bedrock=1}}<!-- When specifically ~16–17 blocks away, I also observed the enderman being unable to teleport to the four blocks directly between the player and the enderman's pre-teleport location. -->

Both teleportation types then apply the following checks:
*As long as the selected block is not [[movement-blocking]], seek downward. If the found block is waterlogged, the teleportation attempt fails.
*Starting again with the originally selected target, seek downward as long as the block below is not [[movement-blocking]]. The teleportation attempt succeeds if no liquid or solid blocks prevent them from standing at the destination.
Thus, endermen need at least three non-solid blocks above the destination to successfully teleport, and do not teleport to waterlogged blocks unless the ceiling above is movement-blocking.<ref>{{bug|MC-220319}}</ref> Endermen can appear to teleport further than their maximum teleport distance when teleporting downward, as distance through air<!-- or other blocks that are not movement-blocking --> is not a factor when seeking downward for a valid location.

Blocks that have a large enough collision box but are not [[movement-blocking]], such as [[carpet]] that is not above a movement-blocking block, [[snow layer]]s 10 or more deep, and [[azalea]], can be used to prevent teleportation. Endermen always teleport an integer Y distance, so an enderman at Y=70.0 cannot teleport onto a movement-blocking block covered by a single carpet, snow layers only 2 deep, or many other short blocks, while an enderman at Y=70.99 could teleport onto snow layers 8 or 9 deep.

Endermen always attempt to teleport upon taking damage. Most melee attacks are successful,{{Only|Bedrock|short=1}} but the enderman usually teleports a few blocks behind the player when hit if there is space behind the player. Endermen can be attacked with projectiles if they are in a [[boat]] or [[minecart]]. If all available blocks within teleport distance are removed or unavailable as a destination, it is possible to hit endermen {{in|je}} with a projectile, although arrows may simply bounce off, dealing no damage.<ref>{{bug|MC-79556}}</ref> When teleporting due to damage, it makes 64 attempts to teleport.{{Info needed|Does it also make 64 attempts for teleportation caused by a projectile?}}   

An enderman cannot teleport while it is in a minecart or boat, although in rain and water it attempts to do so, always teleporting back repeatedly until death.

=== Moving blocks ===
Endermen have the unique ability to pick up, carry, and set down certain blocks, even when angered. Every tick, an enderman has a {{frac|1|20}} (5%) chance to select a random block in a 4×3×4 (XYZ) region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically encompassing it. If the enderman can directly see this block and the block is on the "holdable" list, it picks up the block. An enderman cannot pick up blocks from a completely flat floor unless it is made of non-full blocks such as mud or soul sand. An enderman can still pick up and place blocks while sitting in a boat.

Endermen do not despawn while holding a block.

Endermen drop whatever item the block they are holding would drop when it is mined with a [[Silk Touch]] tool, which usually means it drops the block itself, though there are [[Silk Touch#Usage|some exceptions]], like dropping stone instead of infested stone, or not dropping anything when holding bedrock. Endermen do not visually let go of the block when dying.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-30144}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MC-221422|||WF}}</ref>

Endermen can pick up the following blocks:
{{columns-list|colwidth=16em|

* {{BlockLink|Cactus Flower}}
* {{BlockLink|Clay}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}

[[Data pack]]s in ''[[Java Edition]]'' can change this list by modifying the <code>minecraft:enderman_holdable</code> [[Block tag (Java Edition)|block tag]].

[[Behavior packs]] in ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'' can change this list by modifying the <code>minecraft:behavior.take_block</code> method, Unlike Java, there is no tag for these blocks, but it is possible to create a custom tag.

While an enderman is carrying a block, it has a {{frac|1|2000}} (0.05%) chance every tick to silently<ref>{{bug|MC-167369}}</ref> place the block in a 2×2×2 region horizontally centered on the enderman and vertically at the same level as the enderman itself if the target location is [[air]] with a non-air block beneath and the block is allowed to be placed at the target location. Endermen cannot place blocks onto [[bedrock]] or [[entities]].

Endermen cannot pick up or place down blocks if the [[game rule]] <code>mobGriefing</code> is set to <code>false</code>.

Endermen can randomly breach walls, bridge [[fence]]s, break [[redstone]] circuitry, set off explosions and kill themselves if they place a block of TNT on a power source, and even construct [[golem]]s by placing a carved pumpkin correctly.

{{IN|java}}, players can summon an enderman holding any block (including the ones not listed above) using the <code>carriedBlockState</code> NBT data. For example, to summon an enderman holding a [[grass block]] with no AI where the player is standing:
<pre>/summon minecraft:enderman ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1,carriedBlockState:{Name:"grass_block"}}</pre>
Endermen can place any block they are summoned with, even if it is not on the allowed list.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The developers have stated that the belief that enderman sounds are backward distortions is just speculation.<ref>{{ytl|IU8xXWIZv2s|Ask Mojang #5: Enderman jibber-jabber!|Minecraft|December 6, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, there is a [[loading tip]] in ''Bedrock Edition'' that reads out "The Enderman language is actually English in reverse."
* [[Notch]] claimed in public that the enderman is a "subtle reference" to the [[Slenderman]], a similar-looking monster with a similar name. Given the later development of the End, it is possible he already had the name in mind, and did not choose it because of the Reddit thread in which their name was revealed.<ref>{{reddit|j09ma/notch_posts_images_of_new_mob|c282dzr}}</ref> 
* [[Dinnerbone]] suggested "a haunting of endermen" as the collective noun for Endermen.<ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|443348580058021888|@nirufe @notch Let's call it a haunting. A haunting of Endermen.|March 11, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, in the third episode of {{MCSM}}, {{SMEp|3}}, a player is given the option to correct the grammar of other characters by specifying that the collective noun for a group of endermen is "a haunting of Endermen". In the fourth Minecraft novel ''[[Minecraft: The End]]'', the collective term used by endermen themselves is "an End of Endermen".
* {{IN|java}}, a player in [[Spectator]] mode can enter an enderman's perspective. This applies a [[shader]] that inverts the colors in the world. In this perspective, [[the End]] appears as an island of grayish purple [[cobblestone]] in a white sky, with white pillars. Other endermen and the [[ender dragon]] are white and have green eyes. Cobblestone also looks similar to End stone.
* In {{JE}}, the texture for an enderman's eyes is located in a different texture file than the body, allowing their eyes to glow. This causes the enderman's eyes to be visible even when under the [[Invisibility]] effect.
**In {{BE}}, the eyes are in the same texture as the body (while keeping the glowing effect), and the texture of the enderman is a {{cd|.tga}} file format. The real object that makes the enderman's eyes visible even when under the [[invisibility]] effect, is the {{cd|enderman_invisible}} material in the enderman's {{cd|client_entity}} [[JSON]] file in the vanilla resource pack.
**With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the eyes of endermen are emissive and have actual glowing.
* The enderman teleportation sound also plays when a player teleports using an [[ender pearl]] or [[chorus fruit]].
* Endermen are allegedly trying to bring about the collapse to all dimensions, as revealed in the 2019 book Minecraft Game Design.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/minecraft-game-design/page/n45/mode/2up Minecraft Game Design (2019) : Jens Bergensten : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive]</ref>
* Notch changed the eyes of endermen from green to purple to match the portal particles.<ref>{{Tweet|jeb_|1528645372935122950|Yes, Notch changed the color to match the portal particles|May 23, 2022|name=[[Jens Bergensten]]}}</ref>
* Endermen possess a skeleton with visible teeth and limb joints.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://minecraftshop.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/minecraft-enderman-skeleton-unisex-premium-hoodie|title=Minecraft Enderman Skeleton Unisex Premium Hoodie|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref>

=== Publicity ===
{{Main|Minecraft in popular culture}}
* Several endermen appear as enemies in the game ''{{Wikipedia|Magicka}}'', depicted in a more realistic style for the first time.<ref>{{YouTube link|JsX8b1ql4kE|Magicka: Fighting The Endermen|CTheConnor|March 26, 2012}}</ref>
* The enderman is a playable DLC character in the crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as an alternate costume for Steve, though with altered proportions to be at Steve's height. Additionally, there is an enderman "spirit" that makes the user vulnerable to damage by water, as are regular endermen.
* Endermen appear as NPCs in [[Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds|''Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds'']].
