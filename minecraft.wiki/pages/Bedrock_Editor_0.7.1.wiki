== Changes ==
*Added new API interface {{cd|IStatusBar}} to manage {{cd|IStatusBarItem}} objects. It can be accessed from {{cd|statusBar}} property on {{cd|IPlayerUISession}}.
**Added {{cd|IStatusBarItemCreationParams}} for status bar item initialization.
**Removed {{cd|text}} property from {{cd|IStatusBarItem}} in favor of {{cd|getText}} and {{cd|setText}} functions. Added localization support for text content.

== Fixes ==
*Fixed a bug related to losing the block palette setting of simple blocks in hotbar between suspend/resume of application.
