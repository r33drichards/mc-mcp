The '''snowy plains''' or '''ice plains''' are snow-covered grassland [[biome]]s in the [[Overworld]] that usually generate near other snowy biomes.

== Description ==
Snowy plains are plains covered with [[snow layer]]s, which are often stacked {{in|BE}}. [[Aquifers]] and [[spring]]s freeze over soon after generation due to the temperature if not exposed to light; thus, [[sugar cane]] that generates alongside water sources often uproot themselves shortly after. [[Lava lake]]s and lava [[spring]]s that generate within the snowy plains biomes melt the snow layers around them. Polar bears, rabbits, zombie horses, and strays spawn here; with the latter two being hostile mobs, making this biome and its variants slightly harder to survive in, as zombie horses spawn with a [[zombie]] rider wielding a [[spear]], while strays are a variant of the [[skeleton]] that shoot arrows of [[Slowness]].

Survival in snowy plains biomes is quite difficult due to the sparseness of the biome and the lack of [[animal]]s; only polar bears and [[rabbit]]s may naturally spawn here, though [[cow]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s and [[horse]]s may spawn as part of villages. Infrequent spruce trees are the only natural source of wood in the regular snowy plains biome and maintaining [[water]] sources, for farming [[crops]] for example, can be tough due to water in this biome freezing into [[ice]], if it is not protected by light or a roof. Strays often spawn in place of skeletons which can make dealing with [[hostile mob]]s even more difficult due to their Slowness arrows, and aggravating polar bears, or even coming near one if accompanied by cubs, can lead to fatal consequences if the player is unprepared. The ice spikes variety can be valuable to late-game [[player]]s due to the occurrence of ice spikes that can be used for a base or as a source of packed ice [[block]]s.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], snowy plains use default environmental settings with a strong cold color grading, making the biome appear icy blue.

Snowy plains generate in areas with very low temperature and low to medium humidity, more frequently at negative weirdness. They can border [[plains]], [[snowy taiga]]s, [[forest]]s and [[windswept gravelly hills]]. 

At higher elevations, snowy plains give way to [[snowy slopes]], [[jagged peaks]] and [[frozen peaks]], less frequently to [[grove]]s. Regular snowy plains are often separated from ice spikes or snowy taigas by [[frozen river]]s.

In coastal areas, snowy plains border [[frozen ocean]]s, with [[snowy beach]]es generating along the coastline.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
