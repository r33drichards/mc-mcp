'''0.25_05 SURVIVAL TEST'''<ref>{{ytl|QEJigVQpR40|Minecraft Survival Mode Vorschau 2|Errrki|September 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|nByTnK1bB4o|Minecraft Survival Mode Test|Plestecheune|September 24, 2009}}</ref> is a version of [[Survival Test]] released on September 3, 2009, at 17:11 UTC.<ref name="0.25_05">[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:11:04 <08Notch> 0.25_05 is up with a bug fix (monsters chasing dead monsters), and a small bonus. :D''" (17:11:04 UTC)</ref><ref>[[Special:Diff/2560|Wiki diff #2560]] – September 3, 2009, 17:12 UTC</ref> This version is not available in the launcher, but has been archived elsewhere.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Skin]]s'''
* Custom skins now display on the player's arm.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''P12:12:15 <liq3> Notch: Skins on arm now! :D''"</ref>

== Fixes ==
'''1 bug fixed'''
* Monsters no longer chase after dead monsters.<ref name="0.25_05"/>

== Trivia ==
*Versions ''_01'' through ''_03'' were not released under those names, and version ''_04'' was skipped. Each patch version of [[0.25 SURVIVAL TEST]] did not change the version number,<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:58:33 <08Notch> i didn't bump the number :-O''" [...] "''A11:58:56 <Quatroking> Notch: but we do have a new version?''" [...] "''A11:59:11 <08Notch> yes, Quatroking ''" (16:58–16:59 UTC)</ref> which led to a wiki admin mistakenly changing the latest version listed on [[Minecraft Wiki (website)|the wiki]] from "[[0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST_03|0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST_3]]" to "0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST_4",<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:59:24 <Quatroking> then how should I put it on the wiki''" [...] "''A11:59:32 <Quatroking> Survival_test_4?''" [...] "''P12:00:34 <Quatroking> I'm changing it to 0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST_4, okay?''" (16:59–17:00 UTC)</ref><ref>[[Special:Diff/2558|Wiki diff #2558]] – September 3, 2009, 17:00 UTC</ref> a version that does not exist.<ref group=note>The number "0.24" was used by him since the multiple reuploads of 0.25 SURVIVAL TEST were released all on the same day and he did not realize that the version number had changed.</ref> Notch saw this and thought that he was telling him that the unlabelled patches for 0.25 should have labels and that the current version should be "_04", so Notch made the next version "0.25_05", even though under Notch's [[version format]] used at the time the version should technically have been "0.25_04".
