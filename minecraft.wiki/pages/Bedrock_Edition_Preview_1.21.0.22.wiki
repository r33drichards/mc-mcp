=== Changes ===

*Changed function from <code>fillBlocks(begin: Vector3, end: Vector3, block: BlockPermutation | BlockType | string, options?: BlockFillOptions): number</code> to <code>fillBlocks(volume: BlockVolumeBase | CompoundBlockVolume, block: BlockPermutation | BlockType | string, options?: BlockFillOptions): ListBlockVolume</code>

'''[[Deferred Rendering Pipeline]] '''
*Added a new feature to the [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/deferredlighting?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable Deferred Technical Preview]: Color Grading and Tone Mapping. 
**This new capability allows resource packs to define their own color post processing for conveying distinct moods and themes.
*New experimental toggle added in video settings menu to remove texture limit and load textures instead of using the "pink texture" called "Remove Texture Limit". Textures will continue to load until the system exhausts all available graphics memory.
*Added light pre-exposure to the Deferred Technical Preview. 
** This new feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. While this won’t result in any immediate visual difference for players, creators now have the freedom to specify sun or atmospheric intensities with values larger than 65,000.
