'''A Warden's Song''', also known as '''The Warden's Lament''', is an animated horror music video released during [[Minecraft Live 2022]], featuring [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] evading a [[warden]].

== Summary ==
<onlyinclude>Steve and Alex are exploring a [[cave]], stumbling upon an [[ancient city]], while a narrator sings. As they stress that no one is around, Steve inspects a [[candle]]. Alex reaches inside a [[chest]], grabbing a pair of [[iron leggings]] enchanted with [[swift sneak]]. Alex then finds an [[echo shard]], which Steve then takes from them, then dropping it, before Alex catches it in midair right in front of a [[sculk sensor]]. Steve accidentally closes the chest, setting the sensors off until they all summon the warden. The narrator confirms the warden has no eyes, but can still sense you in the dark, as Steve and Alex try to hide from it. However, it sniffs them.

Steve and Alex run away in a hurry alongside a swarm of [[bats]], but Steve trips onto a [[sculk]] block. However, a bat flies right into the warden, giving Steve ample time to escape. Steve and Alex think they're safe, but then the warden unleashes its sonic boom. Somehow, they manage to dodge it, then eye an exit from the cave, sealing it off with [[dirt]], [[planks]], and [[cobblestone]]. However, the warden is able to tunnel through.</onlyinclude>

{{Quote|The deep dark is home to ancient cities, sculk blocks, and the warden. The key to navigating the completely quiet biome is stealth, silence, and more silence. That’s why we decided to go down there and sing our hearts out! Speaking of which, what’s that beating sound? Is it getting louder?|YouTube description}}{{Quote|Element Animation produced a song together with an animated music video about the Warden, a monster in the popular video game Minecraft, for the Minecraft Live 2022 event. I was hired by Element Animation to work on the lighting, do all of the compositing, and due to time constraints at the end manage the last two weeks of production, making sure it got finished on time. Additionally, I created the rigs, smoke effects, and a special grain algorithm used in the video.|Bram Stout Productions' involvement}}
