== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Settings]]'''
*Added an "Enable Dithering for Blocks" option to the accessibility settings.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''Graphical'''
* Adjusted rendering settings in [[Vibrant Visuals]].
** Slightly reduced contrast across all [[biome]]s.
** Reduced the intensity of temperature-based color grading in warmer biomes, especially the [[desert]] and all [[badlands]].
** Adjusted the [[End sky|sky color]] in [[the End]].
** Added unique biome settings for the [[dark forest]], making it slightly foggier and gray.

'''[[Settings]]'''
* Updated the accessibility and language settings tabs with [[Ore UI]].
* Re-added the "Text to Speech with Device Settings" and "Improved Input Response" options to Windows devices.

=== Mobs ===
{{Animate|Copper Golem JE1 BE1.png;Exposed Copper Golem JE1 BE1.png;Weathered Copper Golem JE1 BE1.png;Oxidized Copper Golem JE1 BE1.png|32px}} '''[[Copper Golem]]'''
* When interacting with a copper golem, [[Oxidation|scraping]] and waxing particles now appear at the copper golem's location instead of at the location of the block it is standing in.

[[File:Wither Skeleton JE4 BE3.png|width=50x50]] '''[[Wither Skeleton]]'''
* Wither skeletons can now pick up [[copper sword]]s.

=== Technical ===
'''[[API]]'''
* Released {{cd|initialRotation}} member of {{cd|SpawnEntityOptions}} to {{cd|2.3.0}}.
* Released {{cd|initialPersistence}} member of {{cd|SpawnEntityOptions}} to {{cd|2.3.0}}.
* Releasing the light detection API from experimental to stable. 
* Removed entity override limit on Player method {{cd|setPropertyOverrideForEntity}}.

'''General'''
*Network changes may result in better download speeds on Windows devices.

'''Item Components'''
* Added the new {{cd|minecraft:swing_duration}} item component, which defines the duration, in seconds, of the item's swing animation when mining or attacking.
** The duration is specified in the component's {{cd|value}} field.
** Affects visuals only and does not impact attack frequency or gameplay mechanics.
* The {{cd|minecraft:fire_resistant}} item component no longer accepts a direct value assignment and now requires the value to be specified through the {{cd|value}} field.

'''[[Molang]]'''
* Added {{cd|query.base_swing_duration}}, which returns the duration of the mob's swing/attack animation, determined by the carried item and unmodified by effects applied on the mob.
* Added {{cd|query.modified_swing_duration}}, which returns the duration of the mob's swing/attack animation, determined by the carried item and modified by effects applied on the mob.

'''Network'''
*The following level events now emit particles at the exact specified position instead of at the center of the matching block position:
**{{cd|WaxOn}}, {{cd|WaxOff}}, {{cd|Scrape}}.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "Upcoming Creator Features" [[experimental]] toggles.

=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
* Added {{cd|Control Scheme}} string enum. 
** Added method {{cd|setControlScheme(controlScheme?: string): void;}} to {{cd|beta}}. 
** Added method {{cd|getControlScheme(): ControlScheme;}} to {{cd|beta}}. 
* Added Scripting API for {{cd|BlockPrecipitationInteractions}} component.
** This API includes a component class for the {{cd|BlockPrecipitationInteractions}} component and the two methods ({{cd|accumulatesSnow}} and {{cd|obstructsRain}}) of said component.
* Loot table discovery API now includes information about Loot Item Conditions:
** Modified method from {{cd|setControlScheme(controlScheme?: string): void;}} to {{cd|setControlScheme(controlScheme?: ControlScheme): void;}} in {{cd|beta}}.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:precipitation_interactions}} component.
** This component allows creators to determine whether a block should obstruct precipitations or not. And if it does, whether [[snowfall|falling snow]] should accumulate on the block or not like in [[Snowfall#List of blocks that let snow go through|vanilla]].
