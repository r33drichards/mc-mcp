An entity, referred to simply as a '''mob''', was a [[passive mob]] in early development of ''[[Minecraft: Java Edition]]''. This entity came with several different models across early ''Minecraft: Java Edition'' versions. They are an in-game instance of the base mob class.

== Appearance ==
In [[pre-Classic]] and [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]], as well as from [[Indev 0.31 20100131]] onward, the mob's model looked identical to the [[player]] with the default "[[Steve]]" [[skin]].

Rana<ref name=rana>{{tweet|docky|619092636058656768|I completely forgot that some minecraft fan made a papercraft of rana. Whoever did this, you're cool. nice job!|July 5, 2015}}</ref> had a different model, with the appearance of a girl in a frog outfit. This model was used in early [[Indev]] versions up until [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100128-2304|0.31 20100128-2304]]. Rana was based on an original character designed by [[Dock]], the artist who added the model.

There were also three other model variants, which were different skin variants of the same model, these variants being commonly referred to by the unofficial names "(White) Steve",  "Black Steve", and "Beast Boy". These names originated as unofficial fanmade terms created by players on IRC chat shortly after their addition in January 2010,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/Minecraft-IRCLogs Minecraft IRC Logs], Adura.7z, 2010-01-29_#minecraft.log</ref> and were later adopted by the wider community in the absence of any known official names for the mobs.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/796582-names-for-the-new-mobs|title=NAmes for the new mobs?|author=[https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Omega12 Omega12]|website=Minecraft Forum|section=[https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/r4c7 r4c7]|date=January 31, 2010}}</ref> This was several months before [[Notch]] named the default player character "[[Steve]]" in October 2010.<ref>{{Tumblr|notch|1390641415|Weekend activities|October 24, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027005600/http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1390641415/weekend-activities}}</ref> The first usage of the name "Black Steve", which was later followed by "White Steve" and then just "Steve", was likely inspired by the character [https://codemonkeys.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Steve Black Steve] from the TV show ''{{w|Code Monkeys}}''.<ref>{{Reddit2|sub=Cial|id=1dtptnd|author=Cial|date=July 2, 2024|text=I woke up to some interesting news, so uh? Minecaft lore TLDR no clue idiot kid brain at work}}</ref>

== Spawning ==
Mobs would generate in random places when a world was generated when first added in [[pre-Classic rd-132328]]. In [[rd-20090515]] until [[0.0.23a_01]], they could be manually spawned by pressing {{key|G}} while playing. After approximately 1 minute, they would despawn.

During [[Indev]], until their removal in [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100202|0.31 20100202]], mobs spawned in random locations in the world once again.

After being re-implemented but unused in [[Infdev 20100316]], the mob was only spawnable using mods and map editors, but otherwise was not available in vanilla ''Minecraft''.

== Drops ==
In pre-Classic and Classic versions, as well as Indev versions between [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-0040|0.31 20091223-0040]] and [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100129-1452|0.31 20100129-1452]], player model and Rana mobs did not [[drop]] anything upon [[death]].

In [[Indev 0.31 20100130]], mobs could drop different resources depending on their appearance:
* {{EntitySprite|Dock Steve}} "Steve" drops 0–2 [[string]]
* {{EntitySprite|Black Steve}} "Black Steve" drops 0–2 [[gunpowder]]
* {{EntitySprite|Beast Boy}} "Beast Boy" drops 0–2 [[feather]]s

From [[Indev 0.31 20100131]] until their removal in [[Indev 0.31 20100202]], player model mobs could drop 0–2 strings, 0–2 gunpowder, or 0–2 feathers. In [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100201-2227|Indev 0.31 20100201-2227]], mobs could also drop 0–1 [[flint and steel]] instead of the other items.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Mob JE1.gif|150px|thumb|right|The animation of the mob walking before 0.0.15a.]]

Mobs could not change [[block]]s; they would just move around the map aimlessly, walking in slightly imperfect circles and jumping occasionally. While walking, they would flail their arms around, until [[Alpha v1.0.8_01]]. Mobs were affected by [[solid block]]s, but they were able to walk right through liquids, as if they were air. If the player had a custom skin, any mobs (that were using the player model at the time) created would still use the default skin and would not assume the look of the player. They would not notice dangers, and because of this they would sometimes jump into the [[void]] or [[lava]].

After being re-implemented in [[Infdev 20100316]], mobs could no longer move around, but could still float in water and move their head.

== Trivia ==
* Coding for mobs was still present until [[Java Edition Beta 1.6.6]]. Only the mob model was removed in Beta 1.2.
* The version of this mob with the beardless Steve [[player]] skin uses the old player model, so they are actually slightly taller than the player.
* Despite being taller than the player, mobs looked up at the player when chasing them. This is because their actual hitbox and eye height were shorter than the player's hitbox and eye height.
* "Rana" is the word for "[[frog]]" in several languages including Latin, Italian, Spanish and Corsican.
* The Rana and "Steve" models were stored in the game as MD3 files, which is the model format used by [[wikipedia:Quake III Arena|Quake III Arena]]. None of the other models in Minecraft are stored like this, as they are instead hard coded into the game.
* The Rana model is unique in respect to how it is textured. It is the only model that used a palette for its texture, rather than a traditional "[[wikipedia:Net_(polyhedron)|net]]" texture.
* A stylized redesign of Rana appears in the [[add-on]] Actions & Stuff by [[Oreville Studios]] as an available skin. Although unofficial, this design would be used on a button used for the [[Marketplace]], promoting it and its release on [[Marketplace Pass]].<ref>{{tweet|OrevilleStudios|1859678321833066752|Lights... Cameras... Actions & Stuff!
