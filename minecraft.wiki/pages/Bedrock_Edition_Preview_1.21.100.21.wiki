** Both of them are only executable on spiders and cave spiders.
** {{Cd|code=minecraft:entity_spawned_with_default_jockey}} lets spiders and cave spiders spawn as a spider jockey with a skeleton rider, if it's nighttime or underground.
** {{Cd|code=minecraft:entity_spawned_with_biome_specific_jockey}} lets spiders and cave spiders spawn with a skeleton variant rider depending on the biome they spawn in, if it's nighttime and not underground.
*** It adds a [[Wither Skeleton|wither skeleton]] rider in The Nether.
*** It adds a [[stray]] rider in snowy biomes.
*** It adds a [[bogged]] rider in swamp or mangrove swamp biomes.
*** If executed anywhere else or underground, it adds a regular skeleton rider.

=== Technical ===

**{{cd|can_take}}: Entity filters for when the entity can use the goal.
**{{cd|on_take}}: Trigger ran if the entity does take a block.
**{{cd|xz_range}}: XZ range from which the entity will try and take blocks from.
**{{cd|y_range}}: Y range from which the entity will try and take blocks from.
**{{cd|chance}}: Chance each tick to try and take a block.
**{{cd|affected_by_griefing_rule}}: If the goal is affected by the mob griefing game rule.
**{{cd|requires_line_of_sight}}: If the entity requires line of sight on the block it tries to take.
*Removed the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.enderman_take_block}} AI goal, it upgrades to the above goal.
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.place_block}} AI goal, allows an entity to place blocks in the world with the following options:
**{{cd|placeable_carried_blocks}}: Array of block descriptors that the entity can place if its carried item, if empty can place any block from its carried item.
**{{cd|randomly_placeable_blocks}}: Array of weighted block descriptors that the entity can randomly place, if empty the entity will try to place the block in its carried item instead.

**{{cd|xz_range}}: X range from which the entity will try and place blocks in.

'''[[API]]'''
*Removed {{cd|minecraft:destruction_particles}}'s block API from {{cd|beta}}, it was deemed too risky to expose to server scripting API since the component is only being used on client.
*Moved enum {{cd|MovementType}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.0.0}}.
*Moved enum {{cd|StickyType}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.0.0}}.
*Moved class {{cd|BlockMovableComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} to {{cd|v2.0.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|localizationKey}} property on {{cd|Block}}, {{cd|Entity}}, {{cd|Dimension}}, and {{cd|ItemStack}} from {{cd|beta}} into {{cd|2.1.0}}.

'''[[Block]]'''
*{{cd|alpha_test_to_opaque}}, {{cd|alpha_test_single_sided_to_opaque}}, and {{cd|blend_to_opaque}} will now shift to {{cd|opaque}} in the distance again when used as render method in {{cd|minecraft:material_instances}}.
*Removed Upcoming Creator Features toggle requirement from Movable Component.

'''Block Components'''
*Field {{cd|uv_lock}} no longer requires Upcoming Creator Features experiment to work. JSON {{cd|format_version}} still needs to be >= {{cd|1.21.90}}.

'''Components'''
*Content warnings will log missing references in Jigsaw Structure, Processor List, Template Pool, and Structure Sets JSON.

'''[[Molang]]'''
*{{cd|query.is_carrying_block}} is now usable by all entities, not just enderman.
*{{cd|query.is_carrying_block}} returns 1.0 if the entity is carrying any block, including air.

'''[[Texture]]s'''
*Modified Json parsing of {{cd|variations}} texture objects in {{cd|terrain_texture.json}} files:
**{{cd|weight}} field clamped to minimum value of 0.05.
**{{cd|weight}} field clamped to maximum value of 1000000.
