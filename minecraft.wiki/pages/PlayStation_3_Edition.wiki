As of [[PlayStation 3 Edition 1.84|1.84]], the ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' has not received new feature updates, such as [[Village & Pillage]], [[Buzzy Bees]], the [[Nether Update]], [[Caves & Cliffs]], and so on.

Although the PlayStation 3 console has been discontinued with all the other [[Legacy Console Edition]]s, the ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' continued to receive feature updates until the release of the [[Update Aquatic]].<ref>{{Mcnet|update-aquatic-coming-legacy-console-editions|Update Aquatic Coming To Legacy Console Editions|May 3, 2018}}</ref>

== Retail Disc ==
On April 16, 2014, Sony announced the retail disc version of ''Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition'', which was released on May 14, 2014 in Europe and on May 16, 2014 in North America. The game otherwise is identical to the downloadable version. Features such as buying or downloading content on the PlayStation Network are the same for both versions and they both updated at the same time.<ref>[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/04/16/minecraft-playstation-3-edition-coming-to-retail-may-16th/ "Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition Coming to Retail May 16th"] – PlayStation.Blog, April 16, 2014</ref><ref name=bluray1>{{citation|url=https://blog.playstation.com/archive/2014/04/16/minecraft-playstation-3-edition-gets-blu-ray-release-next-month/|title=Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition gets a Blu-ray release next month|author=Owen Hill|website=PlayStation Blog|date=April 16, 2014}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20250614203015/https://blog.playstation.com/archive/2014/04/16/minecraft-playstation-3-edition-gets-blu-ray-release-next-month/ (archive)]</ref><ref name=bluray2>{{citation|url=https://www.playstationtrophies.org/news/news-12877-minecraft-ps3-edition-coming-to-stores-on-blu-ray-next-month.html|title=Minecraft: PS3 Edition Coming to Stores on Blu-ray Next Month|author=Richard Walker|website=PlayStation Trophies|date=April 16, 2014}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20250614203014/https://www.playstationtrophies.org/news/news-12877-minecraft-ps3-edition-coming-to-stores-on-blu-ray-next-month.html (archive)]</ref>

== Gameplay ==
{{Main|Legacy Console Edition#Gameplay}}
The gameplay is very similar to ''[[Xbox 360 Edition]]'', however:

* The world generation tends to generate with roughly the same biome placement as on 360, which is similar to 1.12.2 in the most recent update, but the actual terrain and cave layouts seems to be "taller" and more "square-ish" overall than that of 360.
* The lighting is much brighter and uses a much simpler lighting model.
* The game's performance tends to be much more consistent, with less inconsistent stuttering.

== Skin packs ==

4J Studios planned to produce Skin Packs as downloadable content. Each Skin Pack was said to include 40+ skins to choose from. The first Skin Pack for PlayStation 3, [[Festive Skin Pack]] was released on the same day when ''Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition'' was released which was December 17, 2013.

[[Skin Pack 1 (PlayStation)|Skin Pack 1]] was released on March 27, 2014.

The [[Battle & Beasts Skin Pack]] was also released on March 27, 2014.

[[Skin Pack 2 (PlayStation)|Skin Pack 2]] and [[Battle & Beasts 2 Skin Pack|Battle & Beasts Skin Pack 2]] were released in May 2016.

== Cross compatibility with PS Vita ==

Through Sony's "Cross Buy" initiative, owners of ''PlayStation 3 Edition'' are able to download ''[[PlayStation Vita Edition]]'' at no additional cost. Since the PS Vita Edition is based on the PS3 Edition, saves on PS3 Edition are compatible with PS Vita Edition and vice versa.

This does not apply to ''[[PlayStation 4 Edition]]''. It used to be possible to do a one-way save transfer from PS3 to PS4. As of April 15, 2020, it is no longer possible to transfer saves between PS3s, between PS Vitas, between PS TVs, and from PS3/PS Vita/PS TV to PS4.<ref>"[https://minecraft.net/article/enjoy-saving-your-playstation-game- Enjoy saving your PlayStation game? | Minecraft]" Sofia Dankis, April 3, 2020</ref>

== Trailer ==

{{video note|As with the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One trailer, this one was also created by Hat Films.<ref>[http://youtube.com/HatFilms Hat Films], {{ytl|Jd8jH4m6D_E|"Minecraft - Official PS3 Retail Trailer"}}, ''YouTube'', 2014-04-25.</ref>|nocat}}
