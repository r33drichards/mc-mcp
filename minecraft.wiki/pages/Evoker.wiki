An '''evoker''' is a spell-casting [[illager]] that can be found in [[woodland mansion]]s and as part of [[raid]]s. They are the only source of [[totems of undying]]. Evokers use two spells to attack: one that summons armor-piercing fangs and one that summons [[vex]]es. This is the only way for vexes to spawn (without using Creative mode or commands).

== Spawning ==
=== Woodland mansions ===
Evokers [[Mob spawning|spawn]] during the generation of particular [[woodland mansion]] rooms. They only spawn on floor 2 and 3. They do not respawn after their initial spawn.

Evokers spawned with mansions do not naturally despawn (unless the world [[difficulty]] is switched to Peaceful).

=== Raids ===
In Normal and Hard [[difficulty]], evokers can spawn during [[raid]]s by themselves or riding [[ravager]]s.

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
Evokers spawn during raids starting at wave 5 (on a easy starting at wave three). On Hard difficulty, evokers can also spawn riding a ravager at wave 7. Up to five evokers spawn on Hard difficulty. During these events, they may also spawn as a [[raid captain]].

==== ''Bedrock Edition'' ====
Up to five evokers spawn during raids, with one evoker spawning during waves five and six, and three evokers spawning during wave seven. One of them rides a ravager during wave seven.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===

*{{xp|10}} [[experience]] when killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].
*When an evoker spawns as a raid captain, it always drops its {{ItemLink|ominous banner}} on death, while equipped.

== Behavior ==
An evoker moves at the [[player]]'s [[sprinting]] speed, crosses its arms and does not show its hands. 

Evokers attack [[player]]s, adult [[villager]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[snow golem]]s,{{only|bedrock|short=y}} and [[wandering trader]]s within 12 blocks by raising and waving both of their arms while looking at their target and summoning magical fangs or [[vex]]es, creating different colored [[particle]]s for the different attacks.

If the player is within a ten [[block]] radius and the evoker is not in the middle of summoning an attack, the evoker flees from the player to avoid being attacked.

If an evoker is attacked, all evokers in a twelve [[block]] radius become alerted and start attacking the player, even if they are behind walls. {{IN|java}}, the alerted evokers can attack the player from an infinite distance away, even if the player switches to [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode<ref>{{bug|MC-147574||Attacking a group of evokers gives nearby evokers infinite detection range and broken attack behavior}}</ref>; this can be fixed by relogging the world, or by setting the [[game rule]] <code>universalAnger</code> to <code>True</code>. This is only true for the alerted evokers, not the initially attacked evoker.

An evoker is passive to other [[illager]]s even if it is harmed. Any evoker can search for and join a [[patrol]] if sufficiently near a [[patrol captain]].

{{IN|JE}}, evokers and [[illusioner]]s are faster without any [[effect]]s during raids.

{{IN|JE}}, evokers are given three seconds of the [[Glowing]] effect if a [[bell]] is rung within 32 blocks of them. This applies to both evokers spawned in raids and evokers spawned in woodland mansions.

Evokers flee from [[creaking]]s when within 8 blocks of them.

=== Fang attack ===
[[File:Evoker fang attack.gif|thumb|An evoker attacking with its fangs in a straight line.]]
[[File:Evoker fang attack2.gif|thumb|An evoker summoning fangs in two circles around it.]]The evoker signals this attack by producing purplish-grey [[particle]]s ({{EffectSprite|particle-evoker-attack}}) and a low-pitched [[sound]]. 

A number of fangs rise out of the ground around the player, then snap shut and vanish. The fangs also produce brown particle effects when they close. 

[[Player]]s or [[mob]]s caught in the attack are dealt {{hp|6}} [[damage]], regardless of difficulty{{only|be}}. This harm is not mitigated by [[armor]] but is mitigated by [[enchantment]]s such as [[Protection]]. Any evoker-summoned fangs do not deal damage to any illagers, although fangs summoned or spawned by the player do. When a neutral or hostile mob (except illagers and [[goat]]s) is caught in the attack, the mob retaliates and attacks the evoker.

Fangs appear no lower than the feet of the lowest combatant and no higher than one [[block]] above the feet of the highest combatant. Fangs attempt to appear on the highest [[opaque]] block between those two extremes, but fail to spawn if they are obstructed by a [[solid block]]. In practice, this means that fangs cannot spawn inside deep pits or on top of high walls, but may, for example, go up a staircase if the target is at the top and the evoker at the bottom, or vice versa. Likewise, an evoker floating in a boat on [[water]] cannot summon fangs against a player [[swimming]] or floating in a boat because there are no opaque blocks from which the fangs can appear.

The evoker typically summons sixteen fangs in a straight line toward the target. However, if the target is within three blocks of the evoker, the evoker summons the fangs in two circles around itself: the smaller circle has five fangs and the larger has eight. The fangs do not seek the player, thus the player is able to dodge them. Summoning fangs resets the evoker's spell cooldown to two seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning fangs to five seconds.

=== Summoning vexes ===
[[File:EvokerSummonsVexes.png|thumb|An evoker summoning [[vex]]es.]]
The evoker signals this attack by producing purplish-white [[particle]]s ({{EffectSprite|particle-evoker-summon}}) for two seconds and a higher-pitched [[sound]]. After that, three [[vex]]es appear nearby. The evoker can summon vexes as long as there are fewer than eight vexes within sixteen [[block]]s centered on the evoker. 

This spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to five seconds and resets the cooldown for summoning vexes to seventeen seconds.

Non-air blocks that obstruct a vex's attempted spawning point will prevent it from spawning, meaning it is possible that a summoning can result in only one or two vexes spawning.{{Verify}}

=== Combo attack ===
{{Expand section}}
{{IN|JE}}, evokers may summon two circle fangs while summoning vexes, without any cooldown. It usually happens when a player melee attacks an evoker while it is summoning vexes.

=== Sheep color conversion spell ===
[[File: After the spell.png|thumb|An evoker using its sheep color conversion spell.]]
[[File: Sheep conversion spell.png|thumb|After the spell, the sheep is red.]]
While the evoker is not engaged in combat and {{gmr|mob_griefing|mobgriefing}} is set to <code>true</code>, it changes the [[wool]] color of any blue [[sheep]] within sixteen [[block]]s from blue to red. 

The evoker signals this spell by producing brownish-orange [[particle]]s ({{EffectSprite|particle-evoker-wololo}}) and making a "''wololo''" sound. 

This spell resets the evoker's spell cooldown to three seconds and resets the cooldown for the sheep color conversion spell to seven seconds. Evokers look at the sheep they are using the spell on while they are doing the spell until they finish the spell. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, evokers can still change a sheep's color, even when <code>mobgriefing</code> is set to <code>false</code>.

'''Evoker fangs''' are entities that evokers use to attack the player (or adult villagers, iron golems, snow golems, and wandering traders) with their fang attack.

The individual fangs in an evoker's fang attacks each have a delay. Before the delay is over, the fangs cannot be seen, although unlike truly [[invisible]] entities, fangs in warmup still have a visible [[Debug hotkey#List of debug hotkeys|debug hitbox]]. After the delay, the fangs expand into existence, snap shut, make critical hit particles and shrink out of sight again, dealing {{hp|6}} magic damage to all mobs standing on the spot.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The sheep color conversion spell is a reference to the priest units from [[wikipedia:Age of Empires (video game)|''Age of Empires'']], where they can turn enemy units into friendly units (changing the unit's color in the process) after making a "wololo" sound.
** Because Microsoft controls the copyrights for both ''Age of Empires'' and ''[[Minecraft]]'', [[Mojang Studios]] was able to get the actual "wololo" sound effect to use in the conversion sound effect.
* Evokers are still referred to as 'evocation illagers' in the code for {{BE}}.
* Hitting an evoker in survival mode and converting the gamemode into creative mode still causes the evoker to summon fangs and vexes at the player, although they deal no damage.
* Vex Armor Trim is based on the cloak and eyebrows of the evoker
