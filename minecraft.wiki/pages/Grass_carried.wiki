== Usage ==
=== Appearance ===
<samp>grass_carried</samp> highly resembles the actual grass block. However, there are two key differences between it and normal grass blocks:
* The top texture is a noticeably different color, and in fact matches the side texture much more than normal grass blocks.
** This is due to this block using a pre-tinted texture, whereas the normal grass block uses a grayscale texture with a constant tint.
* While grass blocks use the [[dirt]] texture on the bottom, <samp>grass_carried</samp> uses the side texture on the bottom: [[File:Grass Block (item) BE3 (facing NWU).png|32px]]

=== Functional differences from grass blocks ===
Despite very closely resembling the grass block visually, <samp>grass_carried</samp> has notable functional differences from normal grass blocks:
* It can be broken instantly.<ref name=BreakingFootage">https://youtu.be/djvCj4tZdNM?t=9m06s</ref>
* It does not drop anything when broken.<ref name=BreakingFootage"/>
* It cannot be turned into [[farmland]].<ref name="MCForums"/>
* Blocks which require a dirt-like block below them to exist, such as [[flower]]s and [[sugar cane]], cannot be placed on it.<ref name="MCForums"/>
* Placing an opaque block on top on it does not gradually convert it to dirt.
