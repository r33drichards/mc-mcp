[[File:Potato World.png|thumb|The Potato dimension at night.]]
The '''Potato''', also called the '''Poisonous Potato Dimension''', '''Potato Dimension''' or the '''MegaSpud dimension'''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91PABUgBph4 Poisonous Potato Update]</ref>, is a joke [[dimension]] added in the [[24w14potato]] snapshot.

== Accessing ==
To access the Potato, player must enter a [[potato portal]]. This can be done in Survival by finding a [[pedestal]]. [[Ruined portatol]]s, located by throwing [[potato eye]]s in the Overworld, have a pedestal, and [[stronghold]]s always have a pedestal in them. Many [[village]]s also generate with pedestals.

{{Control|Using}} a [[poisonous potato]] on the pedestal creates a potato portal, if block above the pedestal is air or a replaceable block, like [[water]] or [[snow]].

== Traits ==
[[File:Potato sun.png|thumb|256px|The [[sun]] in the Potato.]]
The Potato is composed of floating islands, similarly to an unused [[Sky dimension]], Floating Islands worlds or the Aether, a dimension from a popular ''Minecraft'' mod. 

Blocks can exist between Y=0 and Y=256. Just like in [[the End]], there is no floor or ceiling, and players can easily fall into the [[void]] if not careful enough. When that happens, a special version of the end poem is displayed.
{{:Java Edition 24w14potato/Potato Poem}}
When the poem finishes (or is skipped), the player launches high above their normal spawn point, wearing [[poisonous pota-toes]].

Any other entity falling into the void doesn't take void damage, and keeps falling indefinitely instead.

Daylight cycle in the Potato occurs as normal ([[clock]]s can be used), but the [[sun]] has a different texture, slightly resembling a poisonous potato. [[Clouds]] and [[weather]] exist as well: it never snows, but [[rain]] and [[thunder]] can occur. <!-- I checked that /weather thunder does indeed produce thunder, but I'm not sure if it ever occurs naturally --> Rain has green tint and it is visible only below Y=110, in all biomes except the hash biome. Rain is poisonous in the wasteland biome.

Both [[water]] and [[lava]] behave just like in the Overworld, with the exception of wasteland biome, where water is poisonous. [[Bed]]s work normally, while [[respawn anchor]]s explode, also mimicking the Overworld. However piglins, piglin brutes and hoglins don't get zombified in the Potato, unlike the Overworld.

== Environment ==
Five biomes generate in the Potato:

* '''[[Arboretum]]'''

* '''[[Corruption]]'''

* '''[[Fields]]'''

* '''[[Hash]]'''

* '''[[Wasteland]]'''

[[Cave]]s and [[canyon]]s cut through the terrain.

=== Generated structures ===
The following types of structures generate in the Potato:

* {{EnvLink|Buried treasure}}
* {{EnvLink|Colosseum}}
* {{EnvLink|Potato mineshaft}}
* {{EnvLink|Potato village}}
* {{EnvLink|Ruined portatol}}
* {{EnvLink|Shipwreck}}
* {{EnvLink|Witch hut}}

=== Terrain features ===
All types of Overworld [[tree]]s, as well as [[huge mushroom]]s, can generate in this dimension. There also exists a tree native only to this dimension, the [[potato tree]]. Normal [[potato]] plants can be found commonly in any biome (especially in fields biome), growing on peelgrass, corrupted peelgrass, poison farmland or gravtater. Most [[flower]]s also can generate in the Potato.

[[Amethyst geode]]s and [[potato geode]]s can generate too, as well as [[monster room]]s and [[hash well]]s, which are variants of [[desert well]]s.

Besides the normal clouds, a cloud-like blobs of [[floatato]] blocks generate between the islands. Rarely a tall spire of terre de pomme, known as "large potatostone", appears on the surface of this dimension.

=== Mobs ===
Many Overworld mobs can spawn in the Potato, with most of them having a different potato-like texture variant, specific to this dimension. These include [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[creeper]]s, [[endermen]], [[spider]]s, [[villager]]s, [[cow]]s, [[chicken]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[armadillo]]s.

Other Overworld mobs spawn, but don't have a potato-like texture: these include [[cat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[iron golem]]s, [[bat]]s, [[witch]]es, [[zombie]]s, [[phantom]]s, [[slime]]s, and [[glow squid]]s.

There are also mobs native to the Potato that are separate entities: [[poisonous potato zombie]]s, [[batato]]s, [[toxifin slab]]s, [[plaguewhale slab]]s, and the [[mega spud]], which is the main boss of this dimension.

[[Piglin brute]]s, [[ghast]]s, and [[giant]]s can spawn during the battle with mega spud. Giants spawned in this dimension have the skin of Mojang Studios developer [[Jay Wells]].
