A '''zombie nautilus''' is an [[undead]] variant of the [[nautilus]] that spawns being ridden and controlled by a [[trident]]-wielding [[drowned]], forming a '''zombie nautilus jockey'''. Once separated from the jockey, it behaves like a regular nautilus, but burns in [[sun]]light instead of suffocating while not in [[water]].

== Spawning ==
{{anchor|Zombie nautilus jockey}}
When an adult [[drowned]] spawns outside of [[river]] or [[frozen river]] biomes, either [[spawn cycle|naturally]] or as part of a [[structure]] (i.e. an [[underwater ruin]]), and is wielding a [[trident]] in its main hand, it has a 50% chance to spawn as a '''zombie nautilus jockey''', riding a zombie nautilus.{{verify|bedrock}} Zombie nautilus jockeys thus spawn in dripstone caves and various ocean [[biome]]s; those that spawn in [[warm ocean]]s will become the '''coral zombie nautilus''' variant, which only differs in appearance.

In this state, the zombie nautilus's movement is controlled by the jockey. When the drowned rider is dismounted or killed, the zombie nautilus becomes neutral. It can then subsequently be tamed and ridden by the player.

Zombie nautiluses count towards the "monster" [[mob cap]] and can despawn like most hostile mobs (unless they spawned as part of a structure) until the first time any player interacts with it. At that point it becomes persistent and no longer counts towards any mob cap either.

Zombie nautiluses do not naturally spawn in the Peaceful [[difficulty]] except during [[world generation]] as part of [[ocean ruins]].<ref>{{bug|MC-304858||Zombie nautiluses can spawn on peaceful by themselves, unlike skeleton/zombie horses and camel husks}}</ref>

== Drops ==

|notes=

}}

Zombie nautiluses behave like regular [[nautilus]]es, drifting through the ocean. They move backward, propelling themselves and leaving bubble [[particle]]s behind.

Zombie nautiluses follow players holding any [[fish]] or [[bucket of fish]] within a 10-block radius.

Unlike the [[nautilus]], zombie nautiluses cannot be bred.

When ridden by a hostile mob, as in the case of a zombie nautilus jockey, the hostile mob controls the movement of the zombie nautilus.

When [[Vibrant Visuals]] are enabled, their eyes emit a surrounding glow that does not illuminate objects, just like the glowing eyes of other mobs such as [[endermen]] and [[drowned]].

As they are [[monsters]], zombie nautiluses count towards the hostile mob cap.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, adult and baby drowned can mount and ride any untamed zombie nautilus that they collide with, but they do not actively search for zombie nautiluses to mount.

=== Attacking ===
Zombie nautiluses are [[neutral]], attacking only when provoked. Like regular nautiluses, they attack by dashing into their target. Zombie nautiluses occasionally dash toward and attack nearby [[pufferfish]].

When dashing toward a target on land, zombie nautiluses can launch themselves out of the water and accidentally become beached on land, where they are unable to move.

They may also unintentionally attack a mob or player that stands between them and their target.

A zombie nautilus can also perform dash attacks when being ridden by a mob, such as when part of a zombie nautilus jockey. It performs dash attacks on its own accord, temporarily taking control of the jockey's movement.

Unlike drowned, zombie nautiluses are ignored by [[axolotl]]s.

When they are hostile or mounted by a drowned, zombie nautiluses cannot be leashed.

=== Taming ===
Zombie nautiluses can be [[tamed]] by being {{Control|fed}} [[pufferfish (item)|pufferfish]] or [[buckets of pufferfish]]. Each pufferfish or bucket of pufferfish has a {{frac|1|3}} chance of taming the zombie nautilus.

These items can also be used to tempt them.

=== Healing ===
Zombie nautiluses can be healed by being {{control|fed}} any [[fish]] or any [[bucket of fish]].

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

Like most other undead mobs, zombie nautiluses also burn in direct sunlight. They are protected from burning when wearing nautilus armor, similar to other undead mobs wearing [[helmet]]s. As nautilus armor has no [[durability]], it does not break from absorbing the damage like helmets do.

Being an [[aquatic]] mob, they are affected by the [[Impaling]] enchantment in {{JE}}. Unlike the normal nautilus, zombie nautiluses don't suffocate outside of the water, as they are undead monsters.

[[Parrot]]s can also imitate them, like other hostile mobs.

{{IN|BE}}, zombie nautiluses:
* Prevent the player from [[sleeping]] if not on [[Peaceful]].{{until|BE 26.0}}
* Are killed by [[conduit]]s if in water or rain.{{until|BE 26.0}}
* Are targeted by [[iron golem]]s and [[snow golem]]s.{{upcoming|be 26.0|nocat=1}}

=== Weaknesses ===
Like regular nautiluses, they can be controlled and even dash on land, but their movement is much slower than in water.

== Usage ==
Tamed and saddled zombie nautiluses can be used as a means of underwater [[transportation]]. When ridden, the player is granted the [[Breath of the Nautilus]] status effect, which pauses the [[oxygen bar]] while the player rides the zombie nautilus. As with other zombies, they can be killed to obtain rotten flesh.

=== Equipment ===
Tamed zombie nautiluses have two equipment slots:
* {{SlotSprite|Saddle}} Saddle slot: for equipping a [[saddle]].
* {{SlotSprite|Nautilus Armor}} Nautilus armor slot: for equipping [[nautilus armor]].

Equipment can be placed on a zombie nautilus by holding it and then pressing the {{control|use}} control on the zombie nautilus, or by accessing the zombie nautilus's inventory. This can be done by pressing the {{control|use}} control on the zombie nautilus while [[sneaking]], or by mounting the zombie nautilus and pressing the {{control|inventory}} control. A [[dispenser]] can also place a saddle or nautilus armor if it is facing a tamed zombie nautilus.

The equipment can be removed by two methods:
* Removing the equipment from their slots in the zombie nautilus's inventory.
* {{ctrl|Using}} [[shears]] on the zombie nautilus. If both a saddle and nautilus armor are equipped, they are removed one at a time. The first use removes the nautilus armor, and a second use removes the saddle.

=== Riding ===
{{main|Riding}}
Once a zombie nautilus is tamed and saddled, the player can control it with the standard directional controls; pressing {{control|forward}} moves the zombie nautilus in the direction the player is facing. The player dismounts using the {{control|dismount}} control. {{IN|bedrock}}, it is impossible for a player to use a [[Nether portal]] or [[End portal]] while on a zombie nautilus. 

Zombie nautiluses are 10% faster than nautiluses when swimming. A zombie nautilus gradually gains speed while moving in a straight line, up to a swimming speed of 7.15 m/s. A zombie nautilus can still move on land when controlled by a player, but is significantly slower, moving at a maximum of 0.97 m/s.

Saddled zombie nautiluses also have the ability to dash. When the player rides them, the experience bar on the [[HUD]] is replaced by a dash charging bar. Dashing is done using the {{control|jump}} control: holding the control charges for a longer dash. When dashing, a zombie nautilus launches up to about 13 blocks forward. A zombie nautilus can dash every 2 seconds. Dashing while moving upward near the surface results in a quick breach, wherein the zombie nautilus and its rider break the surface briefly.
