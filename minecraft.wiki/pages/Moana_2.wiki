'''Moana 2''' is a [[Marketplace]] map and skin pack made to promote the film ''{{w|Moana 2}}'', developed by ''Starfish Studios''.

== Summary ==
The map is an expansive world (which takes after the first film) with many challenges, tasks and adventures to explore, with Moana as the guide.

=== Spawn ===
The player first spawns on the island of Te Fiti, surrounded by two towering, mossy walls. Behind the player is a green, swirling portal-like heart and small [[candle]]s. Vegetation is everywhere as vines and leaf blocks trail across the walls. A golden sand path is trailed ahead with the walls, which act like barriers, lead towards a boat where the player can visit Moana and the Island of Motunui.

=== Island of Motunui ===
A cutscene first plays when the player visits to the Island of Motunui for the first time as Moana welcomes them with Heihei, Pua and a small village child.

This island features many paradisiacal flora and ginormous houses made out of straw. Coconut trees flourish throughout the island with waterfalls, sandy beaches and green, luscious grass dotted around.

By interacting with Moana, she can help the player learn how to sail in the Cavern of the Ancestors.

==== Caverns of the Ancestors ====
Signs are placed along the golden sand path leading to the cave. A golden ray of sunlight shines at the entrance as the player witnesses ahead that they are inside a waterfall with vines hanging above.

Once entered, the game notifies the player to bang the drum, cueing a cutscene to happen which Moana sails inside on her canoe. Moana expresses how the island's population were ecstatic that the ocean could finally be explored again so she built a canoe course to teach her people to sail, including the player.

Another cutscene happens as it previews what the course looks like with text describing what kind of obstacle exist.

===== Canoe Course =====
The player can participate in a sailing minigame to progress the linear storyline. It is a free-for-all genre against 5 other CPUs with a scoreboard showing the player's current position. Natural obstacles such as land masses split the river path in two to create unique pathways in finishing. Water ramps and wind (shown with an floating wooden arch and swirling circle) are useful tools to gain speed and triumph. Water geysers are present unlocking secret shortcuts and used during the main course. Two laps must be done to complete the entire minigame.

==== Loto's Workshop ====
After completing the canoe course, Moana encourages the player to visit Loto's Workshop in order to obtain their own canoe. Signs guide the way to the workshop imaged by a wooden mallet strung together with plants.

Once at Loto's Workshop, the player is invited by Loto to choose a blueprint hanging from the wall in order to choose a design for their boat. This can be changed at any time.

=== Kakamora ===
After selecting a design, the player talks to Chief Tui to sail towards the kakamora (hostile coconut foes) with Moana. A compass navbar is summoned on the top of the screen with an image of a kakamora indicating the location of their barge. If the kakamora is on the left, then they are towards the left; if it is in the centre, then they are directly ahead of the player.

==== Kakamora's Barge ====
When the canoe is close to the barge, a cutscene plays, displaying the humongous barge and the sounds of drums. The leader of the kakamoras is shown to be dancing to a row of musicians.

Once on the boat, the player is tasked to destroy 6 pillars and are given an oar. The oar has a charge-up ability to deal immense knockback. Wooden boxes and décor litter across including bamboo signs to help accomplish the objective with trampolines to manoeuvre around.

== Skins ==
There are 30 skins available which can be used as part of the package.
