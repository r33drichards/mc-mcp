'''Seagrass''' is a [[solid block|non-solid]] plant [[block]] that generates in all [[ocean]]s, except [[frozen ocean]]s.

'''Tall seagrass''' is a two-block high variety of seagrass.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Seagrass can be harvested only with [[shears]]. Using any other [[tool]], [[item]], or the [[player]]'s fist destroys seagrass and causes it to drop nothing. When harvested with shears, regular seagrass drops itself as an item, and tall seagrass drops 2 seagrass items.

Tall seagrass only exists in block form; obtaining it as an item is impossible even in [[Creative]] mode or by using [[commands]].

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Seagrass (feature)}}
Seagrass generates in either its tall or small form in [[river]]s, non-frozen [[ocean]]s, underwater [[cave]]s and [[swamp]]s, replacing [[ice]]<ref>{{bug|MC-129888}}</ref> and [[planks]]<ref>{{bug|MC-128329}}</ref> as necessary. To generate seagrass, the water column it is in must have access to the sky.

=== Post-generation ===
Using [[bone meal]] on any [[Solid block|solid]] block{{only|java}}, or [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[gravel]], or [[clay]]{{only|bedrock}} that is underwater generates seagrass on that block and its surrounding blocks. In order for this to work, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water. 

== Usage ==
The seagrass [[item]] can be placed only on opaque blocks. It breaks when opaque blocks move into its hitbox.

Like [[grass]], [[snow layer]]s, and other such blocks, placing blocks inside seagrass deletes the seagrass. However, seagrass prevents [[coral fan]] placement.{{only|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-33346}}</ref>

Tall seagrass has a [[hitbox]] considerably more appropriate for its size than other two-block-tall plants such as tall grass.<ref>{{bug|MC-163896|||WAI}}</ref>

Seagrass is completely resistant to [[lava]] trying to flow into it, allowing for lava to be floating on top of the water.<ref>{{bug|MC-129731|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Breeding ===
Seagrass can be used to lead and breed [[turtle]]s.

=== Bone meal ===
Applying [[bone meal]] to a regular seagrass transforms it to tall seagrass if there is enough space. The bone meal will not be consumed if insufficient space exists.<ref>{{bug|MC-125642|||fixed}}</ref>

=== Composting ===
Placing seagrass into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Growing turtles ===
Using seagrass on a baby turtle accelerates its growing time. When the turtle becomes an adult, it drops one [[turtle scute]].
