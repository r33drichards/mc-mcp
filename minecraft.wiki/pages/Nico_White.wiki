'''Nico White''' (ニコ・ホワイト, ''Niko Howaito'') is the main protagonist of ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''. A member of the [[White Family]], Nico possesses the rare [[Mod Power|power]] to modify reality around him.

== Appearance ==
Nico is an unusually tall ten year old, with a distinctive spiky red haircut of two protruding spikes of hair,  and goggles. Instead of a cube, his head is an octahedron, representing visible cheekbones. On his left cheek is a scar, while his hair slightly covers his right eye. His outfit consists of a black jacket and wristbands, jeans, a brown belt and shoes, and a white sleeveless shirt. On the back of his hand is a [[Mod Power#Symptoms|Mod Rune]].

== Personality ==
From his introduction, Nico is the quintessential shōnen hero archetype. He is incredibly hotheaded and adventurous, not afraid to get dirty. However, he is not particularly bright, putting himself in grave danger for cheap thrills out of a desire to be like his [[Icco White|father]], and forgets the name of his apparent rivals.

== Powers and abilities ==
Being a member of the White Family, Nico can harness the cursed power of "modding" his reality, enabling him to manifest objects without the need for a [[crafting table]]. More than that, he is able to create wholly new recipes of any proportion, such as a giant [[bucket]].

As a boy, Nico was incredibly durable, being able to survive a several story high explosion face first, and then the magnitude of at least five [[creeper]]s. During this feat he was sent flying, and showed no major injuries beyond mild bruising. He was also incredibly strong, training himself to dig through the floor to escape being grounded. When he grew up, his physical capabilities had only increased, breaking out of a room made out of iron.

== Biography ==
[[File:MCTM Meet Nico.jpeg|right|thumb]]
When he was five, Nico commandeered a creeper and drove it into his [[Theo Village|hometown]]. Although having fun in the moment, the creeper soon detonates, terrifying several workers of a mine. Although he manages to survive, this stunt attracts more creepers into the village. Caught in an even larger explosion, Nico is sent flying away, and is only left impressed by the incident. As his [[Erma White|mother]] approaches to recover him, she squeezes his cheeks, apparently hurting him more than the explosion did. He says he just wanted to be like his dad.

Five years later, Nico has turned ten. Hearing sheep were attracted to [[wheat]], he decided to test it, escaping a hungry flock by jumping off a fence, leaping down a 15 block fall with no injury. Once again, his mother was displeased, shocked he was once again leaving town. Dragging him back home, her mother explains his duties as a White, and stresses that he'll only need to become a hero when he's twenty. Nico digresses, and runs off again, yearning for the mines. He arrives, but bumps into [[Luke]] and [[Bull Brown]], who he embarrasses with minimal effort. As their boss arrives, the three enter into a cave to retrieve [[coal]], and are warned to keep the area light with [[torch]]es. Once again, he completely overshadows his nemesis.
