{{Q|“Moog City” is a fun track. Moog actually contacted me on it, telling me how much they liked it. I’m glad they never found out I actually didn’t make it with a Moog device. I kinda created this song because I ordered a Moog, but I didn’t have it yet.|C418|c418.org}}

'''"Moog City"''' is an album-exclusive song composed by [[C418]] that only appears on ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]''.

== Track description ==
"Moog City" is a looping, ascending melody being played on a synth, accompanied by synth voices, plucked strings, and a glockenspiel. Mid-way through a piano plays and the Moog-like synths becomes quieter. Later, strings are played that grow louder before the piano drops. The song ends with simple piano notes and the repetitive ascending melody played quietly.

A sequel to this track, "[[Moog City 2]]", would be used in-game as part of the [[main menu]].

== Trivia ==
* Despite its name, "Moog City" wasn't created using a [[wikipedia:Moog synthesizer|Moog synthesizer]], but was inspired by it. However, its sequel, [[Moog City 2]], was.
