The '''Standard Galactic Alphabet''', internally referred to as '''alt''' {{in|JE}}, is a font used in ''Minecraft'' for text in the [[enchanting table]]. It covers the constructed script of the same name, created by American video game designer {{w|Tom Hall}} for the 1990-2001 ''{{w|Commander Keen}}'' series of games.

== Definition ==
This is the font used in the Enchanting Table's GUI when an item is able to be enchanted. When mapped to the ASCII layout, only the characters A-Z are textured. Lowercase a-z is an exact copy of the uppercase.

It references {{cd|ascii_sga.png}}.

== Supported characters ==

This is the Standard Galactic Alphabet mapped to the ASCII layout. Only uppercase and lowercase A-Z are mapped, and the uppercase and lowercase are identical.
