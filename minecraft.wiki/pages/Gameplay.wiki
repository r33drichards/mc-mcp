[[File:Survival.png|427px|right|thumb|A fresh [[Survival]] game.]]

'''Gameplay''' in most game modes of ''[[Minecraft]]'' consists mainly of placing and breaking a variety of different [[block]]s in a [[World generation|procedurally generated]] world.

With these blocks, [[player]]s can manipulate the [[world]] around them, building and destroying structures. Since ''Minecraft'' is a sandbox game, there are many types of gameplay. Players can set their own goals and play the game however way they want to. See {{Slink||Game customization}}.

== Core mechanics ==
=== Inventory ===
{{Main|Inventory}}
[[File:Inventory.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|280px|A [[survival]] inventory pop-up screen {{in|Java}}. ]]
The '''inventory''' is the pop-up menu that the player uses to manage items they carry. From this screen a player can equip [[armor]], [[craft]] items on a 2×2 grid, and equip [[tool]]s, [[block]]s, and [[item]]s. The [[player]]'s [[skin]] is also displayed here.

The inventory is opened and closed by pressing {{key|E}} on PC, {{xbtn|Y}} on Xbox, {{psbtn|tr}}/{{psbtn|5tr}} on PlayStation, or {{wbtn|x}} on Switch, and ••• on mobile devices. This key or button can be changed from the in-game [[options]] menu. The inventory can also be closed with {{key|Esc}} on PC, {{xbtn|B}} most game consoles, {{psbtn|o}}/{{psbtn|5o}} on PlayStation, and &times; on mobile devices.

The inventory consists of 4 armor slots, 27 storage slots, 9 [[hotbar]] slots, and the [[off-hand]] slot.

Items can stack up to 64, 16, or not stack at all:
* Most items can stack to 64. This includes all [[block]]s, and most [[item]]s.
* Some other items, such as [[snowball]]s, empty [[bucket]]s, [[egg]]s, [[sign]]s, [[hanging sign]]s, and [[ender pearl]]s, can stack up to a maximum of 16. 
* Some items do not stack at all, notably anything with a [[durability]] ([[weapon]]s, [[armor]], and [[tool]]s), filled [[bucket]]s, and [[potion]]s.

====Crafting====
[[File:Crafting Table.png|40px|left]]
{{Main|Crafting}}
[[Crafting]] allows players to create new [[tool]]s and [[block]]s using [[item]]s from their [[inventory]]. A player can use the 2×2 grid in the inventory or the 3×3 grid provided by a [[crafting table]] to craft.

====Smelting====
[[File:Furnace.png|40px|left]]
{{Main|Smelting}}
Smelting can be done in a [[furnace]], [[smoker]], or [[Blast Furnace|blast furnace]] using fuel (e.g. [[coal]]) to convert an item into a more useful form, such as turning [[raw iron]] into [[iron ingot]]s. Some [[food]] items can also be cooked on a [[campfire]] for free.

====Enchanting====
[[File:Enchanting Table.png|40px|left]]
{{Main|Enchanting}}
[[Enchanting]] allows the player to upgrade [[tool]]s and [[armor]], with an [[enchanting table]] or [[anvil]], but costs [[experience]]. Using the enchantment table also costs [[lapis lazuli]]. More powerful enchantments can be accessed by placing [[Bookshelf|bookshelves]] around the enchanting table. Anvils can also combine existing tools and armor to [[repair]] them and make them stronger.

====Brewing====
[[File:Brewing Stand.png|40px|left]]
{{Main|Brewing}}
[[Brewing]] creates [[potion]]s from various ingredients and [[water]] using a [[brewing stand]]. They are stored in [[glass bottle]]s and then consumed by the player or thrown at a mob to give the player or mob a [[status effect]].

====Trading====
[[File:Plains Villager Base.png|40px|left]]
{{Main|Trading}}
[[Village]]s can be found throughout the world, in [[plains]], [[Sunflower Plains|sunflower plains]]{{Only|be|short=1}}, [[desert]]s, [[savanna]]s, [[taiga]]s, [[Snowy Taiga|snowy taigas]]{{Only|be|short=1}}, and [[snowy plains]]. Here, the player can trade with [[villager]]s for [[emeralds]] to get useful items, like [[food]], [[explorer map]]s, [[ender pearl]]s and enchanted tools and books.

===Mobs===
[[File:Mob Habitat Collage.png|thumb|260px|Different mobs spawn in diverse habitats, depending on the light level, biome, and surface material.]]
[[File:Creeper in forest.png|thumb|upright|right|A [[creeper]] in a [[forest]]. Creepers stalk the player and then explode once they get near.]]
{{Main|Mob}}
The world is populated with various [[mob]]s, including passive and hostile mobs, as well as 2 bosses. Most mobs can be defeated using a [[sword]] or any other [[weapon]].

Mobs [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the [[light level]], [[biome]], and their surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters are commonly found in the dark (e.g. in a [[cave]], a [[monster room]], a [[woodland mansion]], or at [[Daylight cycle|night]]). Animals and hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius around the player.

Some mobs, including most animals, and even [[hoglin]]s, can be [[Breeding|bred]] by the [[player]], using their favorite food. [[Villager]]s cannot be directly bred by the player. Instead, they randomly [[Breeding#Villagers|breeding]] on their own, depending on the time of day and the number of [[bed]]s, which allows players to manipulate their likelihood of breeding.

====Combat====
{{Main|Tutorial:Combat}}
Most hostile mobs actively seek out and attack the player. [[Endermen]] only attack the player if they make eye contact, and [[piglin]]s attack players who are not wearing golden [[armor]]. [[Endermen]] also take [[damage]] in [[water]] and [[rain]]. A [[shield]] can be used to block most attacks from mobs, and is especially useful against [[skeleton]]s.

====Daylight cycle====
{{Main|Daylight cycle}}
It gets dark at night, making monsters spawn on the surface. Sleeping in a [[bed]] lets the player skip the night. The day-night cycle lasts 20 real-life minutes, with 10 of those being day and 10 of those being night. There are no seasons, but the [[moon]] does have phases.

== Game modes ==
{{main|Game mode}}
''Minecraft'' has four basic game modes: [[Survival]], [[Creative]], [[Adventure]], and [[Spectator]]. ''Java Edition'' and ''Bedrock Edition'' have one additional game mode, [[Hardcore]], which is a variation of Survival, locked to [[Difficulty|Hard]], where you won't respawn if you die, and has not been added to ''Minecraft'' ''China Edition'' or ''Minecraft Education''.

===Creative===
[[File:Minecraft Creative.png|right|thumb|The Creative mode inventory showing the Search tab for the ''Java Edition''.]]
{{Main|Creative}}
This mode is for creating structures and experimenting.
* The player has access to an infinite amount of all blocks and items available.
** These can be accessed from the [[Creative inventory]].
* Blocks can be [[Breaking|broken]] instantly, and do not drop their materials.
* The player cannot die (except when falling into the [[void]] in ''Java Edition''), because the health bar and other bars above the [[hotbar]] are removed.
* The player can [[Flying|fly]].
* The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, such as [[spawn egg]]s.

===Survival===
[[File:HUD.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The most common bars in the HUD. Clockwise starting from the bottom left: the experience bar, the health bar, the armor bar, the oxygen bar, and the hunger bar.]]
{{Main|Survival}}
In this mode, players must gather all their materials to build things and to [[craft]] their [[item]]s and [[tool]]s. Also, the [[experience]], [[health]], [[hunger]], [[armor]], and [[Health#Drowning|oxygen]] bars appear above the [[hotbar]]. The armor bar only shows when the player is wearing [[armor]]. The oxygen bar only appears when [[water|underwater]], [[suffocating]],{{only|bedrock|short=1}} or in [[lava]].{{only|bedrock|short=1}} If a player runs out of hearts (health), the player dies and respawns at their [[spawn point]].

There are also 4 [[difficulty]] settings:
* Peaceful: No hostile mobs spawn, and only some neutral mobs spawned. Also, players have natural regeneration, and don't get hungry, making easy survival.
* Easy: Hostile mobs spawn, but deal less damage. Also, [[villager]]s cannot be converted into [[zombie villager]]s.
* Normal: Hostile mobs spawn, but deal a moderate amount of damage. Villagers can be zombified when killed by zombies, but there is only a 50% chance. They despawn if zombification fails.
* Hard: Hostile mobs deal more damage. Villagers always zombify when killed by zombies. Also, zombies can sometimes break down [[door]]s and call reinforcements.

===Hardcore===
[[File:Healthbar Hardcore.png|thumb|class=pixel-image|The healthbar on Hardcore.]]
{{Main|Hardcore}}
In this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the difficulty level is permanently set to "Hard", and the player does not respawn after dying. Also, the health bar has different hearts in this mode. After death, the player cannot interact with the world again and must either delete the map or permanently switch to [[Spectator]] mode. Hardcore is not technically a game mode as it cannot be enabled with the {{cmd|gamemode}} command.
* {{IN|JE}}, hardcore can be selected in the game mode selector.
* {{IN|BE}}, hardcore appears as a toggle, and can be found right below the difficult selector.

===Adventure===
{{Main|Adventure}}
Players can interact with objects such as [[lever]]s and [[button]]s, and can interact with [[mob]]s. However, they can break [[block]]s only with certain [[tool]]s, and place only certain blocks, as determined by the designer. This mode is good for adventure maps.

===Spectator===
{{Main|Spectator}}

When in Spectator mode, players can clip through blocks and fly freely. The player can't interact with blocks, entities or their inventory. 

{{iN|java}}, the player can interact with functional blocks, like [[chest]], [[crafting table]], [[furnace]], etc. But they can't move any [[item]]s in it.

{{iN|java}}, the player can enter the perspective of other entities by left-clicking on them, and are invisible to all players and mobs except for other spectators. When in third-person mode, a player appears as a transparent floating head. The player can use the scroll wheel to adjust the flying speed, unlike flying in Creative mode.

==Game customization==
{{See also|Game customization}}
Players can use [[resource pack]]s, [[data pack]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, [[add-on]]s{{only|be}}, or [[mod]]s{{only|je|short=1}} to augment the game and play the way they want to play. It should be noted that articles about specific mods or similar things are outside the scope of the Minecraft Wiki. However, the wiki does document various technical features about the data format used in resource packs and data packs.

===Other ways to play===
''Minecraft'' can be played in a wide variety of other ways too.
* Players can use the game as a creative medium for story-telling and roleplay.
* The game can also be used as a competitive space. Some examples:
** The ''Minecraft'' minigame, [[Spleef]].
** [[Tutorial:Player versus Player|Player versus Player]] (PvP).
** Various types of [[Tutorial:Custom maps|Custom maps]].
* Mods, add-ons, and data packs and can also be used to make other games inside of ''Minecraft''. However, ''Minecraft'' is not a "game engine". Anyone making Mods, add-ons, or data packs should make sure to follow the guidelines outlined in the [https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula End-User License Agreement].

==Players==
[[File:Steve (classic) JE6.png|left|40px|alt=Steve player character model]]
{{main|Player}}
The player is the person (or player character) that the user controls in the [[world]]. When the user starts a game or save, the player spawns at the [[world spawn]], with an empty [[inventory]].

Each player can also have a [[skin]], which determines what the player character looks like. A player can change their skin on their profile page on [[Minecraft.net]] or in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' {{in|JE}}, and in the pause or main menus {{in|BE}}.

===Blocks===
{{main|Block}}
[[File:Ancient Greece.jpg|alt=A building based on a Greek acropolis.|thumb|280x280px|A building based on a Greek acropolis.]]
The world of ''Minecraft'' takes place within a {{w|Cubic honeycomb|three-dimensional grid of cubes}}, with each cube being occupied by a certain type of block. There are many types of blocks. For example, natural blocks, such as [[Grass Block|grass]], [[stone]] and [[ore]]s that generate randomly within the world. Or blocks that players can [[Crafting|craft]], such as the [[crafting table]] and [[furnace]]. Most of these blocks can then by [[Mining|mined]], by hand or with [[tools]]. Some blocks cannot be broken in [[Survival]], such as [[bedrock]], [[end portal frame]]s, [[command block]]s, and [[barrier]]s.

===Mining===
{{main|Mining}}
[[File:MultipleOreBlobs.png|right|thumb|Various [[ore]]s (in proximity of [[lava]]) that can be mined with a [[pickaxe]].]]
[[Tutorial:Mining|Mining]] is one of the main aspects of ''Minecraft'' and is done to extract ore and other materials mainly from below the surface of the map. These ores include [[coal ore|coal]], [[iron ore|iron]], [[gold ore|gold]], [[redstone ore|redstone]], [[diamond ore|diamond]], [[lapis lazuli ore|lapis lazuli]], [[copper ore|copper]] and [[emerald ore|emerald]]. Mining can involve [[digging]] a hole from the surface or going down through a [[cave]]. [[Mineshaft]]s and [[ravine]]s create extra areas that may contain resources, since they are usually rich in ores.

===Health===
[[File:Heart.svg|left|40px]]
The player has {{hp|20}} hitpoints, called [[health]]. The player loses health upon taking [[damage]], and dies when they run out of health. Health can be restored by keeping the [[hunger]] bar full enough, by drinking [[potions of Healing]], or by eating [[golden apple]]s. In [[Peaceful]] mode, health quickly regenerates on its own. Damage can be reduced by wearing [[armor]] or having the [[Resistance]] effect.

===Armor===
<!--[[File:Iron Chestplate.png|left|40px]]-->
[[File:Armor (icon).png|class=pixel-image|left|40px]]
[[Armor]] protects the player from damage by decreasing all incoming damage by a percentage. When the player is wearing armor, the armor bar becomes visible above the health bar, and displays how much armor the player has. Each {{armorbar|2}} chestplate on the armor bar represents 2 [[Armor#armor points|armor points]].

===Hunger===
[[File:Hunger (icon).png|class=pixel-image|left|40px]]
The player has 20 points of [[hunger]], which can be seen on the hunger bar. Each {{hunger|2|notag=1}} ham shank represents 2 hunger points. Eating food increases hunger points. Despite the name, having more hunger points means the player is less hungry (and therefore more satiated). 18 hunger ({{Hungerbar|18|9px|total=20}}) is required for natural health regeneration, and 6 hunger ({{Hungerbar|6|9px|total=20}}) is required in order to sprint, so keeping the hunger bar full is usually a good idea. Hunger depletes when the player does things (usually things that should require a lot of work), like [[jumping]] and [[sprinting]].

The [[Hunger (effect)|hunger status effect]] should not be confused with hunger points.

===Experience===
[[File:Experience Orb Value 37-72.png|class=pixel-art|left|40px]]
[[Experience]] ('''EXP''' or '''XP''' for short) can be gained from defeating [[mob]]s or performing many kinds of other actions. Experience has no direct effect on the player character, but it can be used to enhance their equipment through [[enchanting]], or by using an [[anvil]] to repair, rename, or combine enchantments on equipment. Most sources of experience are produced in the form of '''experience orbs'''. {{IN|java}}, experience gained affects the player's '''score''' on the [[death screen]].

===HUD===
[[File:HUD example.png|thumb|350px|The HUD as seen in Survival mode {{In|je}}.]]
The [[heads-up display]] is the GUI displayed over the game world. It includes a hotbar, and shows the player's held item on the right of the screen.

====Hotbar====
The hotbar is a sequence of 9 selectable [[inventory]] slots that the player can store items in. The player can use various buttons to select or cycle through these slots. The selected item is then displayed as the held item in the player's right hand, or an empty fist if the slot is empty. The selected can then be used, using the same buttons the player would use to [[Breaking|mine]] a block or use a [[crafting table]] (on mobile, a special button might appear and the player can press that button to use the item).

====Chat====
[[Chat]] is a built-in messaging system used to communicate with other players, and to execute [[commands]]. By default, the player can press {{key|T}} or {{key|Enter}} on a keyboard, [[File:Chat button.png|25px]] on touchscreen,{{only|bedrock|education|short=1}} or {{Xbutton|onedpad-right}} on controllers{{only|bedrock|short=1}} to open the chat.

====Effects====
The player can obtain various [[status effect]]s in various ways. For example, [[golden apple]]s give [[Absorption]] and [[Regeneration]]. Some status effects, like Regeneration, can buff the player to make them stronger, while others, like Slowness can debuff the player to make them weaker. Also, some mobs give the player status effects. For example, [[shulker]]s give [[Levitation]] and [[warden]]s give [[Darkness]].

====Riding====
The player can [[Riding|ride]] various [[mob]]s, by using the same button they would to use a crafting table (or by pressing "Mount" on mobile). These include [[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[camel]]s, [[pig]]s, [[strider]]s, and [[happy ghast]]s. Players can also ride in [[boat]]s and [[minecart]]s in the same way. Most of these mobs and vehicles can be controlled by the player, but some mobs require a [[saddle]], [[harness]], [[carrot on a stick]], [[warped fungus on a stick]] to ride or control. Additionally, some mobs must be tamed by the player in order to be ridden or controlled.

===Achievements===
[[Achievement]]s {{in|be}} and [[Advancement]]s {{in|je}} are ways to gradually guide new players into ''Minecraft'' and give them challenges to complete. For example, "The Lie" is given for crafting a [[cake]]. {{IN|BE}}, completing certain achievements rewards the player with [[Character Creator|cosmetics]]. There are many exclusive achievements and advancements that only exist in one edition of the game, while other achievements and advancements are shared.

==Dimensions==
===Overworld===
{{main|Overworld}}
The Overworld is the first [[dimension]] where the player spawns when the world is created. Most of the game's features exist primarily in the Overworld; it is filled to the brim with many [[biome]]s, [[feature]]s, and a variety of [[cave]]s to explore.

===The Nether===
{{main|The Nether}}
[[File:The Nether.png|thumb|right|The Nether.]]
The Nether is a dangerous, hell-like dimension with very hostile environment. It is accessible from the [[Overworld]] by going through a [[nether portal]]. It consists of five unique biomes: the [[nether wastes]], the [[basalt deltas]], the [[crimson forest]], the [[warped forest]] and the [[soul sand valley]]. Each biome has unique generation and terrain. The Nether is populated with [[zombified piglin]]s, [[blaze]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, [[magma cube]]s, [[piglin]]s and [[hoglin]]s. Ores in the Nether include [[nether quartz]], [[nether gold ore]], and [[ancient debris]]. The Nether also has large oceans of [[lava]] with [[strider]]s walking on them.

===The End===
{{main|The End}}
[[File:The End.png|thumb|right|The End.]]
The End is the final dimension of the game, where the player battles the [[ender dragon]]. The End is accessed by entering an [[end portal]], found in a [[stronghold]]. The End is composed of [[end stone]] and is inhabited by [[endermen]]. It also contains tall [[obsidian pillar]]s on top of which are [[end crystal]]s that heal the ender dragon. Once the ender dragon is slain, the [[exit portal]] is opened in the center of the main island and an [[end gateway portal]] is created in the air near the edge of the island. Gateways transport the player to the [[outer End islands]], which are have [[chorus fruit]] forests, and [[End City|end cities]] filled with [[Generated loot|loot]] and [[shulker]]s. Also, some end cities have [[elytra]]. The gateway is 1 block tall, so it can only be entered by throwing an [[ender pearl]], using elytra, or [[crawling]] via a [[trapdoor]] or some other means. There are no ores in the End.

==Multiplayer==
{{Main|Multiplayer}}[[File:Players fighting.png|thumb|right|Player versus player (PvP) on a multiplayer server.]]

=== Servers ===
{{main|Server}}
''Minecraft'' can be played with multiple players in one world using servers hosting a game. Players can connect to external servers through the Internet, or host a server themselves. ''Minecraft'' multiplayer servers have developed to include their own rules and customs, guided by their administrators and moderators. The term [[Tutorial:Griefing prevention|griefer]], meaning a player who causes grief, is a typical term on the internet but has taken up its definition on ''Minecraft'' servers: a person who destroys or defiles other users' creations on servers.

One popular game on multiplayer servers is [[Spleef]] (a play on the word "grief"), a game where the player aims to make another player drop through the floor by destroying blocks beneath the opponent's feet. This is typically played in a designated area and is usually run automatically using server plugins.

Many popular multiplayer servers exist that may contain, PvP arenas, custom [[minigames]] or large [[Survival]] or [[Creative]] worlds. {{IN|be}}, the player can access a few [[featured servers]] without needing to manually add them to quickly get started on multiplayer servers. An [[Official Minecraft Server List|official server list]] has been made for well-known and popular other servers.

==== Minecraft Realms ====
{{main|Realms}}
'''Minecraft Realms''' is an official subscription-based [[server]] hosting service that allows players to create and manage their own private ''Minecraft'' multiplayer worlds. Hosted by [[Mojang Studios]], Realms provides an easy and fast way to create servers and allows the owner to manage them from inside the game, without prior knowledge of the concepts for hosting on the internet. However, Realms are not intended for large public servers, but for groups of friends or as a family server.<ref>{{tweet|danfrisk|311725356434460672|Quick info: Minecraft Realms isn't built for huge public servers. The sweetspot is a group of invited friends or as a family server.|March 13, 2013}}</ref> Private Realms servers are easy to set up and available 24/7 as long as the owner pays for it.

===LAN and Xbox connections===
Players can also play ''Minecraft'' together using [[LAN]] connections. When a world is opened for multiplayer (by default {{in|be}}), other players on the same network can join the world without needing to add an address. This can be used to play ''Minecraft'' together locally with a smaller group of people.

{{IN|be}} players can also join worlds from other players without needing to be connected to the same network or making a server, by using the Xbox friend system. A player can add friends through the Friends tab in the [[Menu screen|menus]] or in the pause screen of a world. A player may invite friends and friends of friends to a world when the player is logged in with their Microsoft account and connected to the Internet.
