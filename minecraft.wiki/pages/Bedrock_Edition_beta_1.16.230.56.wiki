=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Added new noise caves, which come in two types: "spaghetti" and "cheese" caves.
* Added flooded aquifer caves.
* The old "carver" cave generation still generates, combining with the new caves.

'''[[Spaghetti cave]]s '''
* Long, narrow caves.
* Utilize [[noise generator]]s for generation.
* Can form cave entrances when they intersect with land.

'''[[Cheese cave]]s'''
* Utilize [[noise generator]]s for generation.
* Often form caverns of various sizes.
* Can form cave entrances when they intersect with land.

'''[[Aquifer]]s'''
* Used to generate bodies of [[water]] in new caves.
* Currently only used below Y=31, meaning any noise caves between Y=31 and Y=63 are flooded with water. This will be fixed.
* Replaces the old underwater cave carvers/canyons.
* [[Fish]], [[axolotl]]s, and [[glow squid]] spawn in aquifers if it is under an [[ocean]] or [[river]].

== Changes ==

'''[[Swimming]]'''
* Improved visibility when swimming in underwater caves.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Introducing noise based caved generation that enables caves of more varied sizes and shapes.
* Bringing local water levels to caves, allowing each cave to have its own water level.

'''[[Mineshaft]]s'''
* Mineshafts now fit into large caves.
* Mineshaft corridors are now attached to the ceiling via chains or to the floor via wood pillars when missing support platform.

'''Ore distribuition'''
* Changed ore generation to match the new world height, and to add more strategy to mining.

== Fixes ==
'''Gameplay'''
* Fixed a crash that could occur during gameplay.
* Fixed a crash that occurred when curing a Zombie Villager in another dimension if the player had not travelled back to the Overworld since entering the World. ({{bug|MCPE-121559}})
* Fixed a crash that occurred when generating jungle biomes when the Caves and Cliffs experimental toggle was enabled.
'''Character Creator'''
* Fixed a crash that could occur when switching between owned and non-owned Character Creator items.
