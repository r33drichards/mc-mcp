'''Ultra-Fine Iron Wire''' (超極細の鉄のワイヤー, ''Chō Gokuboso no Tetsu no Waiyā'') is very thin iron-reinforced thread created using the [[Mod Power#Imagination|Imagination]] [[Mod Power]] in ''[[Minecraft: The Manga]]''.

== Appearance ==
Due to its nature as a trap, the Ultra-Fine Iron Wire is very difficult to see when strung up. However, it resembles regular thread.

== Functionality ==
When strung up in high quantities, the Ultra-Fine Iron Wire can be used as a trap, entangling its opponents. This is particularly effective against larger opponents.
