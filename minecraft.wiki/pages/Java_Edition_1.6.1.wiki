== Trivia ==

* This is the first of the older versions that are available in the Minecraft launcher to not require be launched by a helper-wrapper class (<code>net.minecraft.<wbr>launchwrapper.Launch</code>) that was used for ''pre-1.6'' versions to tweak the old code to the new launcher's needs. This and all the later versions are being launched normally, by their main class (<code>net.minecraft.<wbr>client.<wbr>main.Main</code>), which means they are fully compatible with the current Minecraft launcher.
