[[File:SolidLiquid.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of the solid [[stone]] and [[liquid]] [[water]] [[block]]s]]

'''Solid blocks''' consist of any type of [[block]] that has a [[collision box]] that [[player]]s, [[mob]]s, or other [[entities]] cannot simply move through, and have to move on top of it or around it. Solid blocks are significantly different from [[liquid]] or [[Air|gas]] blocks, through which entities can freely pass.

== Properties ==
{{see also|Mob spawning#Spawn conditions}}
[[Mob]]s require a solid top surface to [[Mob spawning|spawn]]. Some mobs are able to spawn inside of the space occupied by another block, but only if their hitbox does not intersect the collision of any solid block.

Players, [[mob]]s, and other [[entities]] can [[walk]] on top of solid blocks. Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles or water drip particles) also collide with solid blocks.

=== Full blocks ===
<!-- [[Full block]] and [[full blocks]] redirect here. -->

If a solid block's [[collision box]] is a full cube that is solid on all sides, it is known as a '''full block'''. For example, [[stone]], [[planks]], and [[glass]] are full blocks, but [[stairs]], [[fence]]s, and [[chest]]s are not. For most blocks, it's easy to tell whether they're full blocks or not, but some are not so obvious:

* [[Cauldron]]s and [[composter]]s are not full blocks because their top face is not fully solid.
* [[Scaffolding]] is not a full block because although its [[interaction box]] occupies the full block, its [[collision box]] does not.
* [[Dirt path]] and [[farmland]] are not full blocks because they are slightly shorter than a full block.
* [[Mud]] and [[soul sand]] are not full blocks despite visually appearing to be because their collision boxes are shorter than their models, so entities standing on top "sink into" the blocks.

Whether or not a block is a full block can influence some game mechanics. For example, [[endermen]] will only place blocks on top of full blocks and [[hoppers]] will not try to collect [[item entities]] if their top face is covered by a full block.

== Height ==
{{Needs update|section=5|List the ones in Bedrock Edition (due to a bug, they are different) <!-- please specify the bug link in mojira and which 'one' it is -->}}
Most solid blocks are 1 block in height, but certain blocks have non-standard block heights.

A [[player]] can automatically step up from a lower to a higher height, if the difference is at most 0.6 ({{frac|3|5}}) of a block. From ground level, this is anything the height of a chain or less.

A player can fit through spaces as small as 1.8125 ({{frac|29|16}}) blocks high, since players are 1.8 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 2-block gap with a floor as high as a [[trapdoor]].

When {{control|sneaking|sneak}}, a player can fit through spaces as small as 1.5 blocks, since [[sneaking]] players are 1.5 blocks tall, respectively. Players can fit through a 2-block space with a floor as high as a slab.

When gliding with [[elytra]], a player can fit through spaces as small as 0.625 ({{frac|5|8}}) blocks high, since gliding players are 0.6 blocks tall. This allows players to fit through a 1-block gap with a floor of 0.375 blocks such as 3 layers of snow, a [[flower pot]], or a [[daylight detector]].

Note that [[door]]s, although appearing to be one 2-meter-high block, are actually composed of two (top and bottom) 1-meter-high blocks.

Here is a list of blocks with non-standard heights, from tallest to shortest in height:

== Width ==
Many blocks are less than 1 meter wide on one or more sides.

The table below shows the widths of various blocks. If a block has several hit boxes of different sizes (for example: [[brewing stand]]s), then each hitbox is listed separately. Blocks with sides of different widths are listed with cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) for each side, assuming that the block was placed from above, with the player facing north.
