== Trivia ==
* While this update introduces [[mud]] as a block, [[Earth:Mud|mud]] has existed in the franchise as a [[fluid]] {{in|Earth}}. The properties of mud in this update are identical to a block.
* Fireflies were originally planned for this update, but were ultimately scrapped as some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of [[wikipedia:Frog|frog]]s in real life.<ref>https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-ditched-fireflies-in-the-119-update-so-kids-real-pet-frogs-wont-croak/</ref> This decision received heavy criticism from the community.
** They were later added as part of [[firefly bush]]es.
* To promote The Wild Update, [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] released a free choose your own adventure game on minecraft.net called ''[[Craft Your Own Adventure: Wild Tales]]''.<ref>{{Tweet|Minecraft|1533116603012874240|Where in the wild will you wander? The Wild Tales await... Craft your own adventure right now: http://redsto.ne/wild-tales|June 4, 2022}}</ref>
* [[Brandon Pearce|Kingbdogz]] stated in a tweet that the souls in the warden's chest is incredibly important to its lore.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1484988496876126210|In terms of character, the souls in its chest were incredibly important to its lore and, likewise with the color palette. It all comes together to tell a story that I think can be really more unsettling than any of these previous iterations, despite it being less "gory".|January 23, 2022}}</ref>
* The official artwork and trailer for the update is notable for marking the first appearance of [[Player#Sunny|Sunny]] and [[Player#Noor|Noor]], before their official introduction into the game.
** Similarly, [[Player#Efe|Efe]]'s first appearance was in the ''What Will You Uncover'' trailer.
* So far, this is the last major update that has the word "Update" in its name. All subsequent major updates and [[game drop]]s (e.g. [[Trails & Tales]], [[Armored Paws]], [[Tricky Trials]], [[The Garden Awakens]], [[Chase the Skies]], etc.) do not have the word "Update" in their names. The first named major update whose name did not include "Update" was [[Village & Pillage]], released in 2019.
