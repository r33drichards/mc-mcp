'''17w17b''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.12]], released on April 27, 2017.<ref>{{snap|17w17a|April 26, 2017}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* {{nbt|long|<code>LoveCauseLeast</code>}}, {{nbt|long|<code>LoveCauseMost</code>}} for breedable entities.
** Together these record the [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html UUID] of the entity that caused a given animal to breed.

'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Added a new number display to track progress while completing certain advancements (as of this version, only Monsters Hunted and Adventuring Time).
* Added the <code>changed_dimension</code> trigger.
** Takes two optional conditions: <code>to</code> and <code>from</code>, both being strings that accept "overworld", "the_nether", or "the_end".
** Without the conditions, you can check if the player travels to any dimension from any dimension.
* The "location" shared object has a new <code>dimension</code> string (same values as above).

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Illusioner]]s'''
* The [[regional difficulty]] requirement for them to cast their Blindness spell is decreased from 3 to 2.

=== General ===
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* The default advancements now all receive their titles and descriptions from the localization files.
* "We Need to Go Deeper", "The End?", "Nether" and "The End" advancements use the new <code>changed_dimension</code> trigger.
