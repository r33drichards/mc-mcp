A '''flowering azalea''' is a variant of [[azalea]] that counts as a [[flower]] for all purposes, including pollination by [[bee]]s, except crafting dyes.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Flowering azaleas can be broken instantly using any tool or by hand. Harvesting a flowering azalea with [[shears]] consumes the durability of the shears for no additional benefit.

A flowering azalea also breaks if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if [[water]] flows into it.

=== Natural generation ===
Flowering azaleas generate commonly on top of [[Moss Block|moss]] in [[lush caves]].

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
When decayed or mined with any tool except [[shears]] and tools enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], [[flowering azalea leaves]] have a 5% chance to drop flowering azaleas. The [[Fortune]] enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II, and 10% at level III.

When {{ctrl|using}} [[bone meal]] on a [[moss block]], each block in a 3×3 to 7×7 area has a 5% chance of growing a flowering azalea.

== Usage ==
Flowering azaleas function like any other [[flower]]s in their interaction and uses with [[bee]]s. Flowering azaleas can be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[podzol]], [[moss block]]s, [[farmland]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], and [[clay]].

Unlike most transparent blocks, mobs can spawn on top of flowering azaleas in ''Java Edition''<ref>{{bug|MC-214293||Mobs can spawn on top of azaleas}}</ref>.

=== Composting ===
Putting a flowering azalea in a [[composter]] has a 85% chance of increasing the composting level.

=== Fuel ===
Flowering azaleas can be used as a fuel source in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.5 items per azalea.

=== Growing trees ===
Unlike saplings, a flowering azalea does ''not'' automatically grow into an [[azalea tree]]. Therefore, using [[bone meal]] on it is the only way to grow an azalea tree. Application of bone meal gives a flowering azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3×5×3 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs.

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with flowering azaleas, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Flowering azaleas can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a flowering azalea have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] containing 2-3 bees.
