== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>shulker_boxes</code> block tag.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Honey bottle]]s'''

* Are now stackable (up to 16).

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Iron golem]]s'''
* Damage progress is now based on the ratio of current [[health]] to max health.

'''[[Parrot]]s'''
* No longer imitate [[polar bear]]s, [[wolves]], and [[zombie pigmen]].

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* Many recipes changed to only require one material instead of nine to unlock.
