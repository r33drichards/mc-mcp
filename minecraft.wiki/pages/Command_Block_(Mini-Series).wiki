== Appearance ==
The object resembles an impulse command block, being primarily orange with beige diamonds and a throbbing, metal core. However, due to the show's art style, it's depicted in a minimalist, "chibi" presentation. The colors are lighter, with all detail gone, beveled edges, and the diamond straps outlined.
