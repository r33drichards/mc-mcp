|1=I was impressed with how easy Minecraft: Education Edition was to setup. Within 45 minutes of the download being provided to me, I was able to get it installed and my students logged in and playing in a world together. No server setup, or networking configuration required.

|1=One of my favorite features of the new Minecraft: Education Edition is the camera and portfolio. I showed my students how to take pictures of their projects and save into their portfolio of work with captions – and they absolutely loved it! And actually they were the ones who discovered that you could place the camera and take selfies of themselves and their classmates… we had a lot of fun in class that day!

|1=Our teachers had been using the MinecraftEdu version for the past couple of years, and were excited to try the new Minecraft: Education Edition. The Minecraft Education team were very supportive and helpful through the Beta program. The tutorial and new features and functionality in Minecraft: Education Edition are awesome. Several of our students also enjoyed being part of the Beta program and sharing their thoughts with the Minecraft Education team. It has been a powerful, real-world learning opportunity for them.
