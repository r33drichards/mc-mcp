An '''enchanted golden apple''' is an [[Crafting|uncraft]]able food item that, upon consumption, grants much more powerful effects than a [[golden apple]]. Despite its name and enchantment glint, enchanted golden apples do not actually have any [[enchantment]]s.

== Obtaining ==

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|enchanted-golden-apple}}

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management|title1=Hunger management}}

To eat an enchanted golden apple, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. It restores {{hunger|4}} points of hunger and 9.6 [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

The enchanted golden apple provides: 
* [[Absorption]] IV for 2 minutes (providing {{hp|16|absorption=1|notag=1}})
* [[Regeneration]] level II for 20 seconds {{in|java}} (long enough to heal {{hp|16|notag=1}}) or 30 seconds {{in|bedrock}} (long enough to heal {{hp|24|notag=1}})
* [[Fire Resistance]] I for 5 minutes
* [[Resistance]] I (20% reduced damage from all sources except the [[void]] and [[starvation]]) for 5 minutes

=== Horses ===
Enchanted golden apples can be used for improving the chances of taming a [[horse]] by 10%, for [[breeding]] and leading horses, and for speeding up the growth of [[baby]] horses by 4 minutes.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage|Enchanted Golden Apple}}

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s run toward any enchanted golden apple item on the ground and inspect it for 6 seconds {{in|java}} or 8 seconds {{in|bedrock}}<ref>{{bug|MCPE-99448||Piglins need 8 seconds to barter, while they only need 6 in java}}</ref> before putting it in their inventory. However, piglins do not eat enchanted golden apples (or any [[food]]).

|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|dev=12w21a|[[File:Enchanted Golden Apple JE1 BE1.gif|32px]] Added a second tier of the [[golden apple]] that provides greater benefits, similar to the golden apple before 1.1.
|It grants [[Resistance]] (5 minutes) and [[Fire Resistance]] (5 minutes) in addition to [[Regeneration]] IV (30 seconds). However, it only restores {{hunger|4}} hunger points.
|It can be [[Crafting|craft]]ed with 8 [[blocks of gold]] and one [[apple]]. Since apples are also renewable, enchanted golden apples are [[Renewable resource|renewable]], as opposed to pre-1.1 golden apples.
|It shines like an [[enchanted]] item and features a magenta tooltip, meaning that it is "Epic" [[rarity]], but it is simply named "Golden Apple". In response, the standard golden apple lost its glint, and its tooltip was changed to a cyan tooltip, meaning that it is "Rare".}}

== Trivia ==
* The damage tag of an enchanted golden apple obtained {{in|Bedrock}} is 1, although setting it to 0 makes no difference.
* {{IN|je}}, if a regular [[golden apple]] is enchanted using an [[anvil]] in [[Creative]] mode, it has a glint like an enchanted golden apple, but the effect when consumed remains the same as that of a regular golden apple.
* Continuously eating enchanted golden apples allows the player to survive in the [[void]] until all the apples are consumed.
