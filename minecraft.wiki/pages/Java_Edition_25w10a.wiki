'''25w10a''' is the tenth and final [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.5]], released on March 5, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w10a|id=a|March 5, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added the {{cd|tntExplodes}} game rule. Previously, that was only avaliable on Legacy Console Edition and ''Bedrock Edition''.
** When {{cd|false}}, [[TNT]] will not explode and cannot be primed by any means.
*** Trying to do so directly, like with a [[flint and steel]], will show a message on the action bar.
*** Powering a TNT block with redstone makes it simply vanish, as does blowing it up with a [[creeper]].
*** A TNT block on [[fire]] can burn up as if it was a [[plank]].
** Default value: {{cd|true}}

'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added {{cd|#flowers}} item tag.
** Corresponds to the {{cd|#flowers}} block tag.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cactus flower]]'''
* Can now be placed on [[farmland]].
* Can now be picked up and carried by [[endermen]].

'''[[Test block]] and [[test instance block]]'''
* Their textures have been updated.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Cow]]'''
* The new models have been tweaked so the horn placement and leg positioning now match the model on Bedrock Edition.
* The textures of temperate cow legs no longer have harsh borders due to a mirroring issue.
* The heads of baby cows are now positioned correctly.

'''[[Sheep]]'''
* Its wool texture has been tweaked to remove the stark line at the back.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|70}}.

'''[[Entity data]]'''
* Custom data (previously present only on [[marker]]s) is now available on all entities.
** It is exposed as a {{cd|minecraft:custom_data}} component, so it can be set by spawning items and matched by predicates.
** The component is currently stored in a field called {{cd|data}}.
** It is stored only if it's non-empty.

'''[[Predicate]]s'''
* Block predicates
** New optional fields have been added to block predicates: {{cd|components}} and {{cd|predicates}}.
** Their functionality and format are identical to the fields {{cd|components}} and {{cd|predicates}} on item predicates, but they operate on block entity components (when present).
*** When present, {{cd|components}} will match exact contents of block entity components.
*** When present, {{cd|predicates}} will match partial contents of block entity components.

* Entity predicates
** A new optional field has been added to entity predicates: {{cd|predicates}}.
*** Its functionality and format is identical to the field {{cd|predicates}} on item predicates, but they operate on entity components.
**** When present, {{cd|predicates}} will match partial contents of entity components.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|54}}.
* "Global" uniforms may now be defined in any shader, and the game will attempt to fill it.
** Currently, these are: {{cd|ModelViewMat}}, {{cd|ProjMat}}, {{cd|TextureMat}}, {{cd|ScreenSize}}, {{cd|ColorModulator}}, {{cd|Light0_Direction}}, {{cd|Light1_Direction}}, {{cd|GlintAlpha}}, {{cd|FogStart}}, {{cd|FogEnd}}, {{cd|FogColor}}, {{cd|FogShape}}, {{cd|LineWidth}}, {{cd|GameTime}}, {{cd|ModelOffset}}.
** The type of the uniform must match what it would normally be, or it'll be undefined behavior.

'''[[SNBT]] format'''
* SNBT now also supports following operations:
** {{cd|bool(arg)}} - converts argument to boolean.
*** If argument is a boolean value, returns value directly.
*** If argument is a number value, returns true if it is non-zero.
** {{cd|uuid(str)}} - converts string representation of UUID to integer array.
* Implicit infinite float values (like 1e1000) are now rejected.

'''[[Sounds]]'''
* Blocks that are broken by a [[piston]] now play their breaking sound.

'''[[Tag]]'''
* Added {{cd|cactus_flower}} to {{cd|#enderman_holdable}} block tag.
* Removed blocks that mine instantly without a tool from the {{cd|#mineable/axe}}, and {{cd|#sword_efficient}} block tags.

'''[[Title screen]]'''
* The [[panorama]] was changed to showcase the [[Spring to Life]].
