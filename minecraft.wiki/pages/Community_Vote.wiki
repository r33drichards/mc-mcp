The '''community vote''' <!-- Please do not change this to "is". The mob vote was discontinued on September 9th, 2024 and is no longer held following that date. -->was an annual event and community poll that took place during or just before ''[[Minecraft Live]]'' events. It allowed viewers to vote for a new [[mob]] or [[biome]] to be added to the game in a future update. The winning option would be added into the game while the losing options got scrapped or shelved. Each option received its own video, explaining its impact on gameplay.

== History ==
Starting from 2022, the vote took place before the show went live and players were able to cast their votes across three areas: a [[Event servers|server]] on {{BE}}, via the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'', and on [https://minecraft.net minecraft.net].<ref>{{Mcnet|best-mob-vote-tutorials|Best Mob Vote Tutorials|October 14, 2022|[[Kristina Horner]]}}</ref> In 2023, players could also vote in the ''[[China Edition]]'' launcher. Previously, the vote was held on the official [https://twitter.com/Minecraft ''Minecraft'' page on Twitter] during the livestream. The results of the votes were released during the livestream. The community vote was discontinued on September 9th, 2024, making [[Minecraft Live 2023]] the last official Minecraft event to have a mob vote.<ref>{{mcnet|the-future-of-minecrafts-development|The future of Minecraft’s development|September 9, 2024|Ryan Cooper}}</ref>

The [[frog]] and the [[Copper Golem|copper golem]] are the only mob vote mobs which have been selected to be introduced to the game despite losing their mob votes, reintroduced in [[the Wild Update]] and [[The Copper Age]] respectively. However, the devs have stated they are willing to rework old ideas if the theme of the update is right for the mob.<ref>https://x.com/_LadyAgnes/status/1311619804219019267</ref><ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/q81usv/_/hgmlk3g/</ref><ref>https://x.com/kingbdogz/status/1581393745182093312?s=20</ref>

== Trivia ==
* An unrelated [[Chinese prediction poll|prediction poll]] was also held in China, teasing the announcement at [[MINECON Earth 2018]] of a Chinese "national treasure" coming to ''Minecraft''. Options in the poll were the Giant [[panda]], Chinese alligator, Golden monkey, White-lipped deer, and River dolphin.<ref>https://mc.163.com/pe/client/activity/voteforanimalpc/index.html</ref> The [[panda]] won the poll, was announced a few days later during the livestream, and subsequently added in [[Village & Pillage]].
* Though not officially considered Mob Votes, there have been other occasions where players could vote to influence the game. These include Jens asking to add either [[llama]]s or {{w|alpaca}}s,<ref>{{Tweet|jeb_|757952180146012160|A friend is in urgent need of your help to settle this matter|July 26, 2016}}</ref> and the cat vote featuring Jellie, Zach and Coco as options for a new [[cat]] skin.<ref>{{mcnet|your-cat-could-be-minecraft|Your cat could be in Minecraft|October 13, 2018|Tom Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Tweet|Minecraft|1063522092057067521|Jellie, Zach, and Coco – these are the three final felines that remain in our CAT CONTEST! 😻|November 16, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1063522133593260032|Which cat do you want to see added to Minecraft?
