The '''Discovery Update''' is the name of the update for ''[[Pocket Edition]]'', ''[[Windows 10 Edition]]'', ''[[Gear VR Edition]]'', ''[[Apple TV Edition]]'', ''[[Fire TV Edition]]'', and ''[[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]]'' that added most of the features from the [[Exploration Update]] and [[World of Color Update]], including [[woodland mansion]]s and [[glazed terracotta]]. Except for the ''Apple TV Edition'' and ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'', it marked the final named update before every platform was consolidated under the now-official term ''[[Bedrock Edition]]''.

The update released as version [[Pocket Edition 1.1.0|1.1.0]] on June 1, 2017. For ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'', it was released as version [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.9.19|1.9.19]] on January 15/16, 2019 and was the final update released for that platform.

The official name for the update, the ''Discovery Update'', was revealed on March 29, 2017, in a blog post on the ''Minecraft'' website.<ref>{{Mcnet|discovery-update-pocket-and-win-10-soon|The Discovery Update: on Pocket and Win 10 soon|March 29, 2017}}</ref>
