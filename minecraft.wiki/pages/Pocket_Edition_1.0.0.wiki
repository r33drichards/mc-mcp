{{relevant guide|Bedrock Edition guides/Ender Update}}

'''1.0.0''', the first release of the '''[[Ender Update]]''', was a major update to ''[[Pocket Edition]]'', ''[[Windows 10 Edition]]'' and ''[[Gear VR Edition]]''<ref>[https://www.mojang.com/2016/11/pocket-and-win-10-getting-10-the-ender-update-soon/ "Pocket and Win 10 getting 1.0 - The Ender Update soon!"] - Mojang, November 11, 2016</ref> and the first release of ''[[Apple TV Edition]]'' and ''[[Fire TV Edition]]''.<ref>{{Mcnet|apple-tv-edition-released|Apple TV Edition released!|December 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.com/Mojang-Minecraft-Fire-TV-Edition/dp/B01NCJDPER</ref> It was released on December 19, 2016<ref name="MCSiteArticle" /><ref name="ms-news">https://news.xbox.com/2016/11/11/end-2016-ender-update-minecraft-windows-10-pocket-edition/</ref> and added [[the End]], new [[achievements]], [[music|in-game music]], increased world height, and new [[mobs]] including the [[Ender dragon]], [[shulker]]s, and [[polar bear]]s. This is the final version released in 2016.

With the release of the Ender Update, ''Pocket Edition'' and its derived editions were becoming more equivalent towards that of {{el|je}}, although several features were still missing. As such, with the addition of the End, these editions had been developed to the point of a "completed gameplay loop",<ref>[https://www.mojang.com/2016/12/pocket-edition-is-5-years-old-have-a-trailer-for-10/ "Pocket Edition is 5 years old! Have a trailer for 1.0!"] - Mojang, December 1, 2016</ref> and the Alpha/Beta tags were dropped entirely, marking their "official release".

* Naturally generate inside the End gateway structures after killing the dragon and traveling someplace new in the End with it.

* Cubs will follow their parents.
* Drops 0–2 [[raw fish]] (75% chance) or 0–2 [[salmon]] (25% chance), each increased by 1 per level of [[Looting]].

* Hostile mobs with the appearance and some behavior of a solid purple block.

* When attacking, it opens its shell on a spinning animation revealing the creature inhabiting.
** Looks like a little white cube with big eyes.
** Its attack consists of shooting projectiles with the appearance of white sea urchins.
*** The projectiles chase the player until the player is out of range.
**** It does not chase a [[spectator]].
*** They can move along only one of the three grid axes at a time and on integer steps.
**** This means they move through [[wikipedia:Taxicab geometry|taxicab geometry]].
*** They can be knocked away by attacking them.
*** Getting hit by a projectile causes {{hp|2}} of damage and inflicts the {{EffectLink|id=levitation-revision-1|levitation}} status effect.
*** Shulkers take more damage if they are attacked while their shell is open.
* It has an idle animation where it opens its shells a little to peek through.
* It can be pushed by [[piston]]s and resists being placed on any position that isn't 3 integers (except if they are riding [[minecart]]s).

*** Removing its support block.
*** Pushing it into a non-air block (except [[Piston#Piston Head|piston heads]]).
*** Pushing a non-air block into its position (except piston heads).
* It's one of the few entities (apart from [[boat]]s and [[minecart]]s) that can be stood on.
** It even displaces the player properly during its attacking and idle animations.
* Has various NBT tags associated with it, which can control its animation, block attached, location and target location of projectile.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Chorus tree]]'''
* Generate on the outer islands of the End.
* Tree-like arrangements of the new [[chorus plant]] and [[chorus flower]] blocks.
* The whole structure is destroyed when the bottom-most block is destroyed, like [[cacti]].
* Can be farmed by planting the chorus fruit flowers that come from the top of the plants, on top of [[End stone]].
** Unlike cacti, chorus plants do not require the supporting block to be below it, but rather adjacent.
*** This allows the structure to grow around obstacles, like other chorus trees.

'''[[End city]]'''
* Generate on the new outer End islands.
* Dungeon-type structure fashioned like a branching tower made of [[End stone]] and many of the new blocks.
** Resembles a tree house.
* Contains loot inside of [[chest]]s.
* Generates with [[shulker]]s in it.

'''[[End gateway]]'''
* Generate in a radius around the main portal each time the dragon is killed.
** Up to 20 gateways can be generated this way.
** It is the usual way of traveling to the outer End islands, without having to build or fly all the way over there.
** It consists of the [[end gateway (block)|gateway block]] in the middle and two little bulbs of bedrock on the top and bottom.
*** Since the bulbs of bedrock leave a one block slit on the horizontal plane, it is accessible only by throwing [[ender pearl]]s at it, or by riding [[pig]]s, [[boat]]s or [[minecart]]s.
*** When used, it generates another gateway at the player's destination.
**** The gateways are linked so the player has a way back.

'''[[Exit portal]]'''
* The only way back to the [[Overworld]] without dying.
* Contains the [[dragon egg]].

'''[[Igloo]]'''
* Spawn randomly in [[ice plains]] and [[cold taiga]] (but not the hills variant).
** Spawning parameters are shared with [[desert temple]]s, [[jungle temple]]s, and [[witch hut]]s: the fact of a structure spawn is decided, then the biome determines which structure (if any) is spawned.
* An igloo contains: 9 [[Carpet|white carpets]], 3 [[Carpet|light gray carpets]], 2 blocks of [[ice]], a [[redstone torch]], [[furnace]], [[bed]] and a [[crafting table]].
* Some igloos have a [[stone brick]] basement, with a [[cauldron]], 2 [[Carpet|red carpets]], a [[brewing stand]], 3 [[spruce stairs]], a [[cobweb]] and loot chest, along with a [[villager]] priest and [[zombie villager]] priest in [[iron bar]]s. A [[trapdoor]] with [[ladder]]s leads down, into the mossy brick basement, cracked and stone brick also available, with 2 torches.
** In the loot chest there is a [[golden apple]], hinting that the player needs to cure the zombie.
** Always spawns with a splash potion of weakness hinting the player to use these on the zombie to turn it into a villager, like the one next to it.
** The zombie has the <code>PersistenceRequired</code> tag which makes it not despawn.
** [[Silverfish]] spawn in some stone brick blocks.

'''[[Obsidian pillar]]'''
* Generate throughout the end's central island.
* Are capped by an End erystal that heals the ender dragon.

'''[[Obsidian platform]]'''
* It is a 5×1×5 square of [[obsidian]].
* Place where players entering The End always spawn.

'''[[The End]]'''
* New dimension.
* Replaces the previously planned [[Sky Dimension]].
* [[Endermen]] and the [[ender dragon]] spawn there.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Levitation]]'''
* Received when the player or mobs is hit by [[shulker]] projectiles.
* Makes player involuntarily float high into the air.
** Can be used to get to higher places.
* Listed as a negative effect due to the potential to kill from [[Damage|fall damage]].
* Higher levels of levitation result in faster floating.
** Effect levels 128-254 result in floating downward at a constant speed, with level 128 being the fastest and level 254 the slowest (one block per second).
** Effect level 255 disables falling and jumping altogether, to an effect not entirely unlike flying in creative mode. Gaining or losing elevation is impossible without using pistons.
