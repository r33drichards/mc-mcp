== Trivia ==
* This snapshot's cover screenshot was taken at seed <code>ddnqavbk</code> at coordinates X=1861 Y=170 Z=2678. It generates most accurately in snapshot [[21w40a]].<ref>{{tweet|djmrfunnnyman|1448326621581258753|@adrian_ivl So as it turns out the screenshot you took for the 21w41a announcment background is taken in the same location as one of my bug reports, what are the odds! (MC-238842) Seed is ddnqavbk location 1861 170 2678 version 21w40a|October 13, 2021}}</ref>
