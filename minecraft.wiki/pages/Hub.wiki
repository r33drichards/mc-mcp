The '''hub''' is a joke [[biome]] introduced in [[Java Edition 25w14craftmine|25w14craftmine]].

== Description ==
The hub consists of a small room made of [[Sky (block)|sky]]. There is a small stone platform with a [[mine crafter]] in the middle of the room, [[shimmering door]]s to both sides, and an infinitely long corridor with a [[hanging sign]] above the entrance reading "Memory Lane" filled with [[mine revisitor]]s. The main room and any new rooms created with shimmering doors will be enclosed in sky blocks. The corridor has open space above its ceiling, and walls of sky blocks up to the build limit on the left and right sides as well as the side facing the hub. In this biome mobs cannot spawn and there is also no [[sun]] or [[cloud]]s like in the [[Overworld]]. The player can change the sky using a [[dimension control]] and [[sky box]] in which the player can change this sky in this biome to the Overworld to make it look like the Overworld.
