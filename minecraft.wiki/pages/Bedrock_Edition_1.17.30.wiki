**This allows for natural variation in the terrain of any individual biome, both in terms of shape and elevation.
***For example, [[Forest|forests]] and [[Desert|deserts]] could form up on a hill without needing a special biome just for that purpose.
**This additionally allows for smoother transitions between biomes.
*[[Terrain]] is now smoother and more extreme.
