}}'''Moo''' is a [[cow]] appearing in the novel [[Minecraft: The Island|''Minecraft: The Island'']], befriending [[Guy]], the protagonist of the story.

== Appearance ==
Moo is described as merely a common cow mob, or at least near identical. Initially, Guy describes generic as "black and white" with a wide, rectangular body, before approaching and noticing gray horns, pink "inside the ears," and a pink "shallow sack" below the stomach. The fact they're "black and white" as opposed to the official brown and gray could be conjecture on the character's part, however it is repeated several times, and Guy proceeds to meet a [[sheep]], who is described as "practically all black" in comparison. No distinction is made so it is likely all that is said applies to Moo.

== Personality ==
On the surface, Moo appears (and very likely is) a typical cow mob, displaying no outward intelligence. To Guy, however, Moo serves as his conscience. After briefly attempting to flee [[The Island (location)|the Island]] and returning with a broken [[boat]], Guy imagines a cow criticizing him for how reckless the stunt was, teaching him to plan ahead, and after that calling Guy out for cowering to the thought of being alone. Eventually, this cow is killed by a [[creeper]], leading Guy to meet Moo and think twice about killing her.

Although considered different cows by Guy, both are written very similarly, being somewhat sassy and blunt yet supportive and encouraging. As such, it is plausible that Moo is not one singular cow, but many being projected on, who know no more than Guy does. This is shown several times, where Guy asks a question about the rules of the Overworld, such as [[Mob spawning|spawning]], and Moo either dodges the subject or makes it sound obvious. Her sentience is also thrown into question, if not demonstrably proven, in the chapter ''It’s not Failure That Matters, but How You Recover'', where a building Guy constructed is burned to the ground by [[lava]]. Despite the stakes and Guy pleading for her and the other animals to flee, they do not.

"Wha...?" I said, nervously looking all around. "Who... Who's there?"

== History ==

* [[Minecraft: The Island]]
* [[Minecraft: The Island (map)|Minecraft: The Island]] tie-in map
* [[Minecraft: The Mountain]] (mentioned)

== Trivia ==
* As a peer of a lonely, stranded figure that is used for comfort on an island, Moo conceptually resembles the ball Wilson from the 2000 [[w:Robert Zemeckis|Robert Zemeckis]] film [[w:Cast Away|''Cast Away'']].
* Moo, and by extension other animal characters in the story, were created to give Guy a way to have conversations and project thoughts while remaining alone on the Island.<ref>{{Mcnet|the-mountain|The Mountain|March 2, 2021|Alex Wiltshire}}</ref>
* In ''the Island'' tie-in map, there is a hub world featuring a statue of a cow. Because of the in-game context, it could be assumed this is meant to be Moo, however it is not confirmed.
