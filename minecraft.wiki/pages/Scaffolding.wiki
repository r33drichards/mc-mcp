'''Scaffolding''' is a climbable semi-solid [[block]] with a stable top platform and unique {{Control|place|text=placement}} controls that simplify creating columns and bridges. Scaffolding pieces fall downward if placed too far away from a supporting block, which can naturally form into more supporting columns.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Scaffolding is [[instant mining|broken instantly]], and no tools are required. Scaffolding requires support and drops as an item if it loses this support.

{{breaking row|Scaffolding|horizontal=1}}

Breaking scaffolding with almost any tool doesn't reduce its durability, except for shears.<ref>{{bug|MC-174829||Shears damaged by every block}}</ref>

== Usage ==
[[File:Scaffolding building.gif|thumb|A stack of scaffolding created by placing another scaffolding block on the side face of the bottom scaffolding block.]]
When the bottom [[block]] of scaffolding is destroyed, all scaffolding blocks above it break, similar to [[chorus plant]]s and [[bamboo]]; this makes it easier for [[player]]s to make temporary structures. 

The placement of scaffolding is different from any other blocks in the game.

{{IN|java}}, when holding scaffolding, the hitbox of scaffolding in the world is a full block.
* Pressing {{control|use}} on the top face of the scaffolding adds the scaffolding to the horizontal side, depending on the horizontal direction the player is facing. When pressing use on the other faces of a scaffolding, the scaffolding is added on top of the highest scaffolding in that location, allowing the player to build the scaffolding structure higher on the ground.
* When the player's eyes are inside the scaffolding, the placement depends on the vertical rotation of the player's head. If facing more than 45 degrees down, pressing use adds the scaffolding to the horizontal side, depending on the horizontal rotation of the player. Otherwise, the scaffolding is added on top of the highest scaffolding in that location.
* While {{control|sneaking}}, pressing use on a face of the scaffolding places the new scaffolding on that face, just like placing a block on full blocks (dirt, stone, etc.).
* While {{control|sneaking}} and the player's eyes are inside the scaffolding, pressing use adds the scaffolding to the direction the player is facing.

{{IN|bedrock}}, the hitbox of scaffolding in the world is not a full block even when holding a scaffolding, so the player can hit/interact with other blocks through the scaffolding. But when being hit, the scaffolding's interaction box is a full block.
* When trying to place a scaffolding inside of another scaffolding, the scaffolding is added on top of the highest scaffolding in that location, allowing the player to build the scaffolding structure higher on the ground.
* When pressing use while hitting the scaffolding, a new scaffolding is placed on the interaction face, just like placing a block on full blocks (dirt, stone, etc.). There's an exception that trying to place a scaffolding on the bottom face of a scaffolding adds the new scaffolding on top of the highest scaffolding.
* When the player's eyes are inside the scaffolding, pressing use places a scaffolding to the direction the player is facing. There's an exception that trying to place a scaffolding on the bottom of the scaffolding adds the new scaffolding on top of the highest scaffolding.

The placing scaffolding may fall as a [[falling block]] if not adequately supported.

[[File:How to Play Scaffolding.png|thumb|Scaffolding can be placed up to 6 [[block]]s away from the base of support.]]
Scaffolding can be placed up to 6 blocks out from the base of support (i.e. scaffolding block on a solid block) that is targeted; any further scaffolding placed [[Falling Block|falls to the ground]] unless able to be supported by a different scaffolding block. Only one additional block can be placed after 6 blocks, even if more would be able to be placed.

Scaffolding has different collision detection. The player can climb up or down by {{control|jumping}} or {{control|sneaking}} respectively. {{in|java}}, floating scaffolding has a solid bottom.

A scaffolding block can be moved by [[piston]]s, allowing them to be broken easily.

Scaffolding can be [[waterlog]]ged.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, scaffolding cannot be placed inside [[lava]]; if scaffolding is placed next to [[lava]] or [[fire]], the scaffolding is destroyed. If it falls into [[lava]] or [[fire]], it is destroyed immediately.

{{IN|Java}}, scaffolding is not ignited by [[lava]] and can be placed inside. It will be destroyed by [[fire]].

Mobs do not spawn on scaffolding. {{IN|Bedrock}}, mobs can spawn inside of scaffolding if the block below the scaffolding is spawnable. {{IN|Java}}, very small mobs such as [[chicken]]s can spawn in the empty space inside of a scaffolding block if the block below is spawnable.

Scaffolding resets the fall distance of players that fall onto it while sneaking, and can be used to prevent fall damage. While in scaffolding, the speed of all mobs and players is decreased.

=== Fuel ===
Scaffolding can be used as a [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 0.25 [[item]]s per block.

== Trivia ==
* When at the [[Altitude|build height limit]], if the maximum horizontal scaffolding build limit (6 + 1 blocks) has been reached, the message for build height limit is still shown, even though scaffolding would not normally have been placed.
