'''Diamond horse armor''' is the second-strongest tier of [[horse armor]]. Unlike other [[diamond]] items, it cannot be [[crafted]] and is only obtainable from [[chest loot]] in various [[structure]]s.

== Obtaining ==
{{LootChestItem|diamond-horse-armor}}

== Usage ==
Only regular adult [[horse]]s and [[zombie horse]]s can wear diamond horse armor; baby horses, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s and [[skeleton horse]]s cannot be equipped with armor.

=== Equipping ===
Diamond horse armor can be equipped to a horse either by manually placing it in its respective slot ({{SlotSprite|Horse Armor}}) in the horse’s inventory, or by pressing [[control|Use]] on the horse while holding it.

The diamond horse armor can be removed either by manually removing it from the armor slot or by using [[shears]] on the horse.

=== Protection ===
When equipped, diamond horse armor gives {{armor|11}} [[armor point]]s and 2 armor toughness.

Horse armor protects [[zombie horses]] from burning in sunlight.

If a horse dies while equipped with diamond horse armor, it drops its normal loot, a [[saddle]] (if it had one), and the horse armor.

=== Upgrading ===
{{Smithing|showdescription=1|Netherite Upgrade|Diamond Horse Armor|Netherite Ingot|Netherite Horse Armor}}

=== Durability ===
Unlike player armor or wolf armor, horse armor does not have [[durability]]. This means a single diamond horse armor can be used infinitely unless it is destroyed through other means.

=== Enchanting ===
Unlike player armor, horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, {{in|java}} Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an [[anvil]] to enchant with [[Thorns]], [[Feather Falling]], [[Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Blast Protection]], [[Curse of Binding]], and [[Curse of Vanishing]]. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.
