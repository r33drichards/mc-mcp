== Reupload ==
Beta 1.8 Pre-release was reuploaded approximately 24 hours after its initial release to fix bugs and remove some debug features that were accidentally left in the game. Features and bugs present in the initial version include:

* [[Village]]s do not generate correctly. Only the wells, gravel paths, and lampposts generate; houses do not generate.
* The [[stronghold]] does not generate correctly. Only the central staircase generates.
* Various models often become corrupted.
* Screenshots can sometimes fail to save, printing an error into the chat: <code>Failed to save: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Number of remaining buffer elements is x, must be at least y. Because at most y elements is required, regardless of actual returned element count</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are two numbers, with <code>y</code> being less than <code>x</code>. This bug seems to occur after changing the resolution of the game window, and can be solved by making the window smaller.
* The world can sometimes fail to save, resulting in lost progress when quitting.
* Various debug keys exist.
** {{key|F9}} freezes the camera in its current position.
** {{key|F6}}, while also turning back time, enables a strange "bouncy" movement. It locks the player's Y coordinate (meaning they cannot jump or fall). It makes the player accelerate relatively slowly when moving. The speed can be changed using mouse scroll, negative speeds revert the controls. Additionally, blocks lose their collision, however the player is still affected by solid blocks trying to push them out (as observed in normal gameplay), though if the player is moving quickly enough they can push all the way through a block. Strangely enough, negative speeds "suck" the player into blocks on collision.
** {{key|N}} and {{key|M}} change the view's rotation clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively. Holding both keys simultaneously resets the rotation.
** {{key|Y}} and {{key|H}} decrease and increase the field of view, respectively. These keys seem to affect the field of view differently to how the FOV option does - the player's hand (or anything the player is holding) also becomes stretched as the field of view increases or decreases, which does not happen if the player changes the FOV option in the menu. Holding both keys simultaneously resets the field of view.
** {{key|I}} makes the player look up, {{key|J}} looks left, {{key|K}} looks down, and {{key|L}} looks right. These movements are normally done by moving the mouse. This setting cannot be reset by holding any keys simultaneously.
** {{key|U}} and {{key|O}} moves the third-person camera forwards and backwards, respectively. This setting cannot be reset by holding both keys simultaneously.

== Trivia ==
* Beta 1.8 Pre-release is the first pre-release for ''Minecraft''.
** Beta 1.8 Pre-release is also the first publicly released development version of ''Minecraft''.
* This version suffered from many glitches before reupload (see images below).
* This is currently the oldest server version to support Mojang authentication servers. This means any prior version requires setting online-mode in [[server.properties]] to false in order to join them.
