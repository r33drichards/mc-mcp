'''Packed ice'''{{fn|'''Compressed Ice''' in [[Language#Differences between English variants|British English]].}} is a variant of [[ice]] that functions almost identically, but does not melt and is [[opaque]] instead of transparent. Like other types of ice, it can only be obtained using a [[Silk Touch]] tool.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Packed ice can be obtained using any [[tool]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], though a [[pickaxe]] is the fastest. Without Silk Touch, breaking it drops nothing. Unlike normal [[ice]], packed ice never turns into [[water]] when broken.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Packed Ice|Pickaxe|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Packed ice is found in the rare [[ice spikes]] biome. It also forms [[iceberg]]s found in [[frozen ocean]]s. Packed ice also generates in [[frozen peaks]] and in [[ice patch]]es.

Packed ice generates as windows in [[igloo]]s.{{only|bedrock}}

Packed ice generates as [[pile]]s (and in some houses or meeting points) in [[village]]s in [[snowy plains]] biome.

Packed ice also generates in [[ancient cities]] and in [[trial chambers]] surrounding [[stray]] spawners.

=== Trading ===

== Usage ==
=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}
=== Speed ===
Packed ice is slippery, causing most [[entities]] to slide, including [[item]]s. This also allows for increased speed of items in water currents by placing the packed ice under the water current. [[Mob]]s do not travel faster in water currents on packed ice.

{{IN|Java}}, when a non-full block of half-block or less in height is placed on top of packed ice, the block inherits the same 'slipperiness' as the ice below it for most entities, not including [[boat]]s due to a bug.<ref>{{bug|MC-203989}}</ref> Additionally, any non-full block inherits the 'slipperiness' for items.

Boats can travel on packed ice with a top speed of 40 m/s.<!-- Tested on superflat, full ice cover, Java 1.15.2 --> Ice tracks built from [[blue ice]], packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three dimensions.

Mobs can spawn on packed ice. This can allow for compact mob farms that rely on the tendency of pushed mobs to slide off the ice in some way. 

Packed ice is a completely solid block, and allows placement of any objects on top.

Unlike normal [[ice]], packed ice does not melt if placed near light sources.

Packed ice is not a storage block, as it cannot be [[craft]]ed back into [[ice]].

=== Note block ===
Packed ice can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce chime sounds.
