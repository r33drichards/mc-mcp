This snapshot contains a bug which causes all villagers with saved memory disappear when upgrading to it, which was fixed in the [[Java Edition 20w08a|following snapshot]].<ref>{{bug|MC-172078}}</ref>

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''

'''{{Animate|Piglin.png; Piglin with Crossbow.png|32px}} [[Piglin]]s'''
* Spawn in [[crimson forest]]s and [[nether wastes]] biomes.
* Randomly spawns with golden sword or crossbow.
* Adults are hostile; babies are passive.
** Don't attack [[player]]s wearing golden armor.
** Adult piglins turn aggressive when a player is mining [[blocks of gold]] or opening [[chest]]s, even if they are wearing gold armor.
* The player can [[barter]] with them by right-clicking with gold ingots or drop them on the ground, which makes them drop at least one item or block.
** Common barters ({{frac|10|109}} or about 9.17%) are 1–4 [[soul sand]], 1–4 brown [[mushroom]]s, 1–4 red mushrooms, 1–4 [[crimson fungi]], 1–4 [[nether brick]]s, 3–8 [[flint]], or 4–12 [[rotten flesh]].
** Uncommon barters ({{frac|5|109}} or about 4.59%) are 1 [[shroomlight]], 1 [[fire charge]], 4–12 [[gravel]], 2–5 [[raw porkchop]]s, 2–7 [[leather]], or 1–2 [[warped fungi]].
** Rare barters ({{frac|2|109}} or about 1.83%) are 2–4 [[glowstone dust]], 1–3 [[magma cream]], or 2–4 [[ender pearl]]s.
** Very rare barters ({{frac|1|109}} or about 0.92%) are 1 [[warped nylium]], 1–4 [[nether quartz]], or 1 [[obsidian]].
* Attack adult [[hoglin]]s sometimes.
** Baby piglins do not attack and adult piglins do not attack baby hoglins.
* Attack [[wither skeleton]]s.
* Avoid soul fire, soul fire torches, soul fire lanterns, and [[zombie pigmen]].
* Prefer to hunt and fight in groups.
* Convert to a zombie pigman when in the [[Overworld]].

** Contains [[block of iron]], [[block of gold]], [[block of diamond]], [[block of emerald]], and [[block of netherite]].
** Controls what blocks can be used to build a [[beacon]] base.
* Added block tag <code>wall_post_override</code>.
** Contains [[lantern]], [[soul fire lantern]], [[torch]], [[soul fire torch]], [[redstone torch]], and [[tripwire]].

* Added item tag <code>beacon_payment_items</code>.
** Contains [[iron ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[diamond]], [[emerald]] and [[netherite ingot]].
** Controls what items can be used as payment in a beacon's GUI. This does not affect the items displayed by the beacon's GUI.

'''Text'''
* Added text for translation string <code>death.attack.magic.player</code><ref>{{bug|MC-133088}}</ref> which appears when a player dies to a [[potion of Harming]] after being attacked by a player. It now says "''Player'' was killed by magic whilst trying to escape ''attacker''".
