== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Realms]]'''
[[File:Realms Settings "Advanced" Tab (Bedrock Preview 1.21.80.28).png|thumb|The new "Advanced" tab in the Realms settings.]]
*Realms server hosting region preference selection:
**Added a new "Advanced" tab to the Realms settings screen.
**In the advanced tab, Realm owners can select which datacenter region they would like to host their Realm in.
**Options include a list of regions, or allowing the Realms service to automatically select the best region for the Realm owner or the first player to join the Realm in a given session.
**Note that this selection is a preference only and due to server capacity, your Realm may be hosted in a different region than selected.
**In that case, the next closest region to your preference will be selected.
**Added a message during joining a Realm to indicate which server region your Realm is assigned to for that session.
**More information will be shared about Realms server hosting with the next full release.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Structure]]s'''
*Data-driven Jigsaw Structures have been put back behind the experimental toggle.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Vibrant Visuals" experimental toggle.

=== Changes ===
==== General ====
'''Graphical'''
*Updated the format of {{cd|lighting/global.json}} to include support for controlling the new End light flash in [[Vibrant Visuals]]. The {{cd|directional_lights}} section now has two groups: {{cd|orbital}}, which contains the lighting information around the sun and moon, and {{cd|flash}}, which contains information about the [[End]] light flash. The {{cd|flash}} section supports an {{cd|illuminance}} field which controls the max illuminance of the End light flash, and a {{cd|color}} field, which controls the color of the flash. Example JSON with this new format follows:
