The '''ice spikes''' or '''ice plains spikes''' is a variant of the snowy plains, featuring [[ice spike]]s made of [[packed ice]] and other special features.

== Description ==
The ice spikes features large numbers of [[ice spike]]s and [[ice patch]]es dotted across its landscape. No surface [[structure]]s generate in this biome. Instead of grass blocks, [[snow block]]s cover the ground. Vegetation is extraordinarily scarce, as it can only appear in locations where the underlying dirt was exposed during terrain generation. [[Spruce]] trees, [[sugar cane]], [[Poppy|poppies]], [[dandelion]]s, and [[short grass]] can appear under such an occasion. Like in typical biomes, [[lava lake]]s and [[ruined portal]]s generate. Because the whole biome experiences [[snowfall]], [[lightning]] typically doesn't strike within it (that is, without using a [[Channeling]] [[trident]] or summon command). The spikes are an excellent source of packed ice, which can be used for faster [[transportation]], e.g. an unmeltable ice track for boats. 

The sky uses a unique gray/blue color with [[Vibrant Visuals]]. Slightly stronger volumetric [[fog]] and changed lighting effects make the biome look more faded and gray in general. 

Generated in high weirdness values, ice spikes are most commonly separated from snowy plains by [[frozen river]]s, and might border [[plains]], [[snowy slopes]], [[snowy beach]]es, [[stony shore]]s, [[windswept gravelly hills]], [[frozen ocean]]s and rarely a [[cherry grove]] biome. Besides weirdness, ice spikes also require low [[temperature]]s as well as low [[humidity]] values during world generation. 

[[Survival]] in ice spikes is more challenging than in most biomes, comparable to the difficulty of [[desert]]s, due to the absence of trees and [[village]]s. Food is also scarce, with farm animals not spawning in the biome and the only proper food sources being the timid [[rabbit]] and the rare [[Chicken|mount]] of a [[chicken jockey]]. When under direct sky access and not warmed by high [[Effects of light|block light values]], [[water]] freezes, making above-ground [[farming]] and [[fishing]] more problematic. Finally, [[stray]]s spawn on the surface at night alongside the usual [[hostile mobs]], and the slippery landscape can make evasion difficult. {{IN|bedrock}}, [[zombie horse]]s are programmed to spawn on the surface of ice spikes biomes, but they fail to do so naturally as the biome's surface is made of snow blocks instead of grass blocks, which are required for zombie horses to spawn. However, they can still spawn on player-placed grass blocks.
