An '''oxeye daisy''' is a [[flower]] that can be crafted into [[light gray dye]], [[suspicious stew]], and flower charge [[banner pattern]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
An oxeye daisy can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

An oxeye daisy also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] flows over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if the block under the plant is moved or destroyed.
{{breaking row|Oxeye Daisy|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Oxeye daisies generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[plains]], [[sunflower plains]], [[flower forest]], and [[meadow]] biomes as part of [[vegetation]] features. {{IN|java}}, they are also technically capable of spawning in [[dripstone caves]] and [[deep dark]] biomes, though it is very unlikely due to the lack of grass blocks in these biomes. In flower forests and meadows, oxeye daisies only generate as part of [[flower gradient]]s. 

Natural oxeye daisies are found in plains [[villages]]. Potted oxeye daisies can be generated in [[woodland mansion]]s.

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

==== {{JE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, oxeye daisies have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area. In meadows and flower forests, oxeye daisies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains, sunflower plains, dripstone caves, and the deep dark, oxeye daisies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

==== {{BE}} ====
When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, oxeye daisies have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 7×5×7 area. In flower forests, oxeye daisies can generate only in specific locations depending on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains, oxeye daisies cannot generate in tulip-only areas.

When [[bone meal]] is applied to an oxeye daisy in any biome, more oxeye daisies appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|Java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up oxeye daisies, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell an oxeye daisy for 1 emerald.

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, oxeye daisies can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Oxeye daisies can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using an oxeye daisy imparts the {{EffectLink|Regeneration}} effect for 7 seconds, restoring {{hp|2}}. It can be crafted using an oxeye daisy or produced by feeding an oxeye daisy to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with oxeye daisies, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Oxeye daisies can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bees]].

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of an oxeye daisy have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing an oxeye daisy into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of oxeye daisies yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].
