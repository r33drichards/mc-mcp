[[File:Bedrock Loading Screen.png|thumb|A tip displayed on the loading screen.]]

'''Loading tips''' are shown on the [[loading world screen]] {{in|be}}. There are three categories of tips based on player progression, and exclusive sets for Creative mode, Realms, or add-ons.

== List of tips ==
{{info needed section|When the beginner and mid-game tips show up, and the version each tip was added (like on the [[Splash]] page)}}

Note that the in-game text does not have links and styling. It is plain text, and every tip is treated as one line that is wrapped as necessary in the in-game text box. The links and additional explanations in this article have been added for the reader's convenience.

=== Beginner tips ===
These tips are always displayed when loading [[Survival]] worlds and no loading tip progression has been made.

!1
|Break blocks, pick up resources. Use the crafting grid to make helpful items. Now you're crafting!
|[[Mining]] and [[crafting]] are the main aspects of the game.
| rowspan="6" |[[Bedrock Edition 1.20.50|1.20.50]]
|-
!2
|You have endless lives, but your items drop to the ground when you die. Hurry back to pick them up!
|Players can [[Health#Player effects|respawn]] an unlimited number of times but they [[Player#Drops|drop]] their [[Inventory|items]] upon death. Items left on the ground will [[Item (entity)#Despawning|despawn]] after five minutes.
|-
!3
|It's a good idea to build a place where you can safely spend the night.
|[[Tutorials/Shelters|Building a shelter]] keeps a player safe from monsters.
|-
!4
|Use the right tool for the job! Chopping wood with an axe is much faster than using your hands.
|[[Axe]]s (and any other [[tool]]s) chop [[wood]] (and other [[block]]s) faster than bare hands. Taken from the {{edition|console}} but slightly modified.
|-
!5
|Even in Minecraft you'll get hungry, so try to find something to eat before that happens.
|[[Hunger]] also exists in ''[[Minecraft]]''.
|-
!6
|Survival mode has 4 different difficulty levels - Peaceful, Easy, Normal, and Hard. Or play Creative mode and get endless resources!
|There are 4 [[difficulty]] levels: Peaceful, Easy, Normal and Hard. [[Creative]] mode allows the player to build without danger.
|-
!7
|Most monsters only come out at night. During the day you're safe... probably.
|[[Monster]]s spawn at [[Daylight cycle#Night|night]] and in [[Light#Mobs|dark]] places such as [[cave]]s.
| rowspan="5" |?
|-
!8
|Digging straight down or straight up might not be a great idea.
|If a player is digging straight down or up, there is a chance that they may accidentally break into spaces filled with [[water]], [[lava]], or other hazards. Taken from the {{edition|console}} but slightly modified.
|-
!9
|Monsters spawn in the dark. Craft a torch to brighten up any space.
|Most monsters require a [[block light]] level of 0 in order to spawn. [[Torch]]es emit a light level of 14, which prevents monsters from spawning within 13 blocks away from it if placed on a flat surface.
|-
!10
|Beds are great! Craft one to quickly pass the night and set your respawn point.
|A [[bed]] is used to skip [[night]]time and set one's respawn point.
|-
!11
|Be careful when you swim. Stay under water for too long and you'll run out of air.
|If one stays underwater for too long without [[Water Breathing]], they will [[drown]] and [[die]].
|}

=== Mid game tips ===
These loading tips are displayed when loading Survival worlds when the player has completed one full in-game day, tracked by {{Cd|day_one_experience_completed}} in [[options.txt]].
