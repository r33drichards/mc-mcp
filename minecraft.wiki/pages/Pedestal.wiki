A '''pedestal''' is a [[block]] used to create a [[potato portal]] in [[24w14potato]].

==Obtaining==
Pedestals are not obtainable as an inventory item in Survival, even with [[Silk Touch]]. They are available through the [[Creative inventory]] or commands.

===Breaking===
Pedestals have no assigned [[tool]], meaning they are mined at the same speed regardless of the tool used. A pedestal never drops as an [[item]] when mined.
{{Breaking row|horizontal=1|Pedestal|drop=0}}

They are highly blast resistant and have the same hardness as [[reinforced deepslate]].

===Natural generation===
Pedestals can generate naturally in [[ruined portatol]]s, in [[village]]s both in the Overworld and in Potato dimension, at the center of [[end portal]]s in [[stronghold]]s, and in [[colosseum]]s.

==Usage==
===Potato portals===
When a [[poisonous potato]] is {{control|used}} on a pedestal, a [[potato portal]] is spawned above the pedestal. This does not work if pedestal is placed in the Nether or the End (where they do not generate naturally). Additionally, block above the pedestal must be air or a replaceable block, like water or snow.

===Piston interactivity===
Pedestals cannot be pushed or pulled by [[piston]]s. They can, however, be moved by [[floatater]]s.
