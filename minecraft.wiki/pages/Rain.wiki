[[File:Rainy Forest.png|thumb|Rain in a [[forest]].]]
'''Rain''' is a type of [[weather]] that occurs occasionally in ''[[Minecraft]]''.

== Behavior ==

Rain is a somewhat common, temporary, and global occurrence<ref>{{tweet|notch|55984678875836416|It's temporal and global|April 7, 2011}}</ref> that can happen randomly at any time within the [[Overworld]]. In [[Biome#Temperature|colder biomes]], and at certain [[altitude]]s, it [[Snowfall|snows]] instead. No rain occurs in warmer biomes such as [[desert]]s and [[savanna]]s, as well as in other [[dimension]]s. In all biomes, rainfall occurs between Y=256 and Y=356, where it transitions into snowfall.

The average rainfall lasts 0.5–1 [[Daylight cycle#Conversions|''Minecraft'' day]], and there is a 0.5–7.5 day delay between rains. Rain has a small chance to worsen into a [[thunderstorm]].

Rainy weather always clears at sunrise after sleeping in a [[bed]]. Otherwise, it stops after a random duration of time.

== Effects ==

[[File:Rain Fog.png|thumb|A heavy rain obscuring the distance]]
[[File:Afterglow of the Sun.png|thumb|right|The sun is not visible during rain although the sunrise afterglow is visible.]]

Rainfalls darken the world, causing the [[light]] from the [[sun]] to decrease by 3, bringing it to light level 12 in full daylight. [[Moon]]light, however, is not reduced, and remains at light level 4. {{IN|je}}, the sky darkens in all biomes with different colors (see {{Slink|Sky|Colors}} for a full list). {{IN|be}}, the sky turns to {{Color|rgb(103, 103, 103)}} in all biomes, except dry biomes with [[Vibrant Visuals]]. [[Fog]] is colored {{Color|#666666}} ({{Color|#403C44}} in [[pale gardens]]), and is much denser, decreasing view distance by 30%.

Celestial bodies (the sun, moon, and stars) are no longer visible.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160604072213/https://twitter.com/notch/status/55982751265988610 "You can't see sun/moon/stars while it's raining, and days are one level darker."] - [https://twitter.com/notch @notch] on Twitter, April 7, 2011 <small>(Archived)</small></ref> In ''Bedrock Edition'', the sun and moon are still visible in biomes with no rain, but [[stars]] aren't. While flying, rain also decreases visibility on land. Clouds darken from white to light gray (95% {{Color|rgb(191, 191, 191)}} blended with regular colors in ''Bedrock Edition''), although clouds themselves do not precipitate. Although the sun is not visible during rain, the glow associated with sunrise and sunset is still visible.

Rain extinguishes [[fire]]s (including [[Flame|flaming arrows]]<ref>{{tweet|notch|55977565839564800|I'm not making it solidify lava, as that would ruin all surface lava structures when the first rain hits. But it does put out fires.|April 7, 2011}}</ref>), although it does not extinguish lit [[campfire]]s or fires on [[netherrack]] or [[magma block]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160604072638/https://twitter.com/notch/status/56265234951831552 "it will not!"] - [https://twitter.com/notch @notch] on Twitter, April 8, 2011 <small>(Archived)</small></ref> Rain does not [[obsidian|solidify]] [[lava]], and does not empty [[lava cauldron]]s. [[Mob]]s on fire are quenched on contact with rain, preventing [[skeleton]]s, [[stray]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[drowned]], and [[phantom]]s from burning during the day. During rain, [[drowned]] can leave bodies of water when chasing a target, as if it were night time. [[Endermen]] and [[snow golem]]s may die due to their weakness to water; they take damage at a rate of {{hp|1}} per half second. Endermen teleport randomly until they find a dry place. [[Blaze]]s and [[strider]]s that are in the [[Overworld]] also take damage on contact with rain.

At a certain biome-dependent elevation, the rain becomes snowfall, resulting in huge natural mountains having snow on the peaks while it is raining on the ground. Each biome has a certain temperature, and temperatures below 0.15 turn rain into snow. The temperature drops by 0.0016 per block above sea level, so at high elevations, it can be cold enough to snow despite there normally being rain instead.

Other effects caused by rain:

* While [[fishing]], there is a shorter wait time on average to get a bite during rain.<ref>{{tweet|notch|55981125994156032|Higher odds of catching fish while raining.. Good one. :D I'll try making it fill small holes with water, but it might be annoying.. brb|April 7, 2011}}</ref>
* [[Wolves]] shake themselves dry if they are not moving (certain versions only).
* [[Farmland]] becomes hydrated if it is not already.<ref>{{tweet|notch|55972362432151552|Wolves get wet in the rain. Crops will get watered. Anything else it should affect?|April 7, 2011}}</ref>
* Rain fills up [[cauldron]]s with [[water]], albeit slowly.
* [[Trident]]s enchanted with [[Riptide]] can be used on land.
* Tridents enchanted with [[Channeling]] call down lightning when thrown at a lightning rod.
* Tridents with the [[Impaling]] enchantment deal more damage to entities in rain.{{only|bedrock}}
* [[Villager]]s enter houses and stop their daily schedule.{{only|BE}}
* [[Bee]]s that are outside return to their hives.
* Players are granted the [[Conduit Power]] status effect when within a [[conduit]]'s range without having to be in the same body of water.
* [[Axolotl]]s and [[dolphin]]s can survive outside of water.

=== Rain particles ===

Rain [[particles]] create small water particles and make a noise when they hit a block, and this noise can be heard at any point within 16 blocks. {{IN|java}}, these particles can be disabled by setting particles to "Minimal" in the [[video settings]] menu. Although rain particles are visible just in the immediate vicinity, their effects occur within all loaded areas. Raindrops fall only in the two middle lines of a block, thus do not visibly fall directly onto the [[player]]. At Y=-64 and below, rain does not generate particles and the associated sound event.

{{IN|bedrock}}, rain can fall slightly tilted. {{IN|java}} rain always falls straight down.

On the border of a snowy biome and rainy biome, rainfall gradually transforms into snowfall up to eight blocks from the border in ''Bedrock Edition''. On the border of a rainy biome and a dry biome, rain particles gradually decrease in density and the sky brightens. This also happens when the biomes border each other in vertical direction, and has no influence on gameplay. In ''Java Edition'', no transition between biomes exists at all and the border between types of precipitation is visible on the edge of single blocks.

== Issues ==

{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
[[File:Void Rain.png|thumb|300px|Rain falling into the void]]

*Rain falls more slowly than the player.
*{{IN|bedrock}}, rain falls one block into the [[void]] (Y=-65). This can be seen in Creative mode by floating in the void. No particles are emitted from the rain, due to the absence of a block below it.
*Rain still falls above the clouds. Notch explains that the gray above the clouds during a storm is another layer of clouds and the origin of the rain.<ref>{{tweet|notch|130230769347067905|there's another layer of clouds above the low one! That's why the sky turns gray.|October 29, 2011}}</ref>
*Raindrop splash particles can be seen on top of blocks of layer 255 at most, even in biomes where it cannot rain.
