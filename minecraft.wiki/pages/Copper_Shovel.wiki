A '''copper shovel''' is a variant of [[shovel]] that is crafted from [[copper ingot]]s. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the fourth-highest [[tier]] of shovel, having higher [[mining efficiency]], durability, and [[enchantability]] than a [[stone shovel]].

A copper shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[copper ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 62 durability points (25% of maximum durability). Two copper shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A copper shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
