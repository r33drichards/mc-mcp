[[File:Ranagroup.png|thumb|A version of Indev with the [[Rana]] mob.]]

'''Indev''' (short for "<u>in</u> <u>dev</u>elopment") was the third phase of ''[[Minecraft]]'s'' [[Java_Edition#Development|development cycle]]. It succeeded [[Survival Test]] from the [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] development phase, and was the second Minecraft phase to have some of its versions released to the public. Indev was phased out in favor of [[Infdev]] after infinite maps were to be added into the game.

Indev was initially released on December 23, 2009 after [[Notch]] received requests to let the community try out new features he was implementing. Indev version 0.31 was put to the public at minecraft.net/indev and available only to people who had purchased the game<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225052806/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/295879830/oh-ok-here-play-with-the-latest-version|title=Oh, ok! Here, play with the latest version!|website=[[The Word of Notch]]|date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> (which cost €9.95<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615065558/http://www.minecraft.net/prepurchase.jsp|title=Purchase now!|website=minecraft.net|date=June 16, 2009|quote=If you pre-purchase now during alpha, you pay just €9.95!}}</ref>). New features currently contained a more complex and realistic [[lighting]] scheme than Classic's and support for MD3 mob models, demonstrated by [[Rana]], [[Beast Boy]], [[Steve (mob)|Steve]] and [[Black Steve]]. Indev received 29 updates after this, gaining a few fundamental features to ''Minecraft'' as it went, which are listed below. During its lifespan, some updates were devoted mostly for testing new things, like [[torch]]es or [[fire]]. As it progressed, its gameplay became standardized to that of ''Minecraft'' today, however with far fewer features.

Players would play on a limited map with dimensions determined by the shape and size characteristics. Gameplay was dramatically different from [[Survival Test]] and paved the way for future game modes to come. Players now had to use [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, gather and prepare food differently, utilize [[crafting]] and [[smelting]] and be wary of the time of day. Like Survival Test however, players still had to save their map to a file on their computer and reload it if they died.

Indev's limited maps soon raised opportunity for a game changing idea. On February 23, 2010, Indev received its last update and work on [[Infdev]] started, a new mode that would use maps that would have no boundaries and would go on forever. Indev remained available on minecraft.net during Infdev's life and into [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] phase. In September 2010, Indev along with Infdev was removed from the site, leaving Indev without a way to officially be played to this day, as no Indev versions are available in the launcher. A few functions that Indev contained are no longer seen in ''Minecraft'' today, such as picking out map characteristics, having to save and reload maps and the isometric map viewer. These were replaced by [[biome]]s, automatic map saving, [[respawning]] upon death and a new infinite map viewer (which has been removed).

== Versions ==
{{#dpl:

== Trivia ==
* Indev is the only development phase of ''Minecraft'' where all of its versions are missing from the [[Minecraft Launcher|launcher.]]
* If the player tries to play Indev today, without modifications or a proxy, they may be kicked back to the [[main menu]] or the game might crash with a {{cd|java.lang.NullPointerException}} error. However, there are a few versions that still work, including Indev versions [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-1459|0.31 20091223-1459]] to [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20100110|0.31 20100110]].
* Indev had no gaps in the [[bedrock]] layer, neither did Classic, though [[Infdev]] and [[Alpha]] (before 1.2.0) had them.
* In Indev and [[Infdev]], while in the [[inventory]] (or a [[crafting table]], a [[chest]], a [[furnace]]), the [[player]]'s visible arm while in 1st-person view would slowly sway back and forth, it is possible to walk around while this happens, if they did, the visible arm would swing around exactly like it does in 3rd-person view, if the player closed the inventory, the arm would immediately stop moving in place. Reopening the inventory would revert it back to normal.
* If the player walked out of the map, they would be pushed back into the level. The further out they went, the faster they would be pushed back. This does not happen in Indev 0.31.
* If the player plays Indev today, Indev has [[sound]], but Infdev does not. This is because Infdev resources were removed from minecraft.net/resources.
* Indev contained a color palette image titled "cube_nes.png", which matches the color palette used for the [[wikipedia:Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Entertainment System]].
* If the player plays Indev today, their character has a completely black skin. This is because Mojang Studios removed support for skins for Indev. They can still become Steve by disconnecting from the internet.
* Mobs in Indev had the same hurt sound as the player.
* In early versions of Indev, the character in the inventory screen was [[Rana]], used as a placeholder.
* The screen sometimes crashes when generating a "floating" map type. This does not happen in some versions.
* There is a rare glitch that when the player punches a sheep, it drops magenta cloth instead of the normal gray cloth.
* 46% of all of the Indev versions that were made are [[Missing Java Edition versions|lost]]. Although that is the case, there are a few small communities working hard to recover these "lost" versions.
* If the player generated a new world with the selected world theme as "Hell", the player would spawn in a world with significantly less lighting than a normal world. It allowed mobs to spawn much easier, and lava would surround the world.
