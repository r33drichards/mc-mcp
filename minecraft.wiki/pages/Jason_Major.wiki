== Trivia ==

* Jason contributed major changes to [[rabbit]]s, which were introduced with the first Bedrock Edition rabbits for [[Pocket Edition Alpha 0.13.0|Alpha 0.13]], and later ported to [[Java Edition 1.9]].<ref name="pe_rabbits" />
* During a game jam, Jason first came up with the [[stray]], among a bunch of other mobs – [[Jeb]] "thought these particular ones fitted really well with what we were already planning &#91;for [[Java Edition 1.10]]&#93;"  <ref>[https://minecraft.net/en/article/meet-stray They’re based on a concept that emerged from a game jam the Bellevue team had, where they were just adding a bunch of stuff to Minecraft - whatever they wanted. Jason Major made a bunch of cool mobs and I thought these particular ones fitted really well with what we were already planning. So we added them!] – Jens Bergensten, December 16, 2016</ref>
* Root beer is one of his favorite drinks and he usually has some in glass bottles by his desk.
* He occasionally joins the official Minecraft livestreams and he was present on the livestream where the dyeable beds were previewed
