'''Models''' are three-dimensional shapes used in ''Minecraft'' that are used to display objects encountered in the game.

The models pertaining to the vast majority of [[block]]s and [[item]]s can be configured, as well as those of a small selection of [[entities]]. Models are stored as [[JSON]] files in a [[resource pack]] in the <code>assets/''<namespace>''/models</code> folder.

== Block models ==
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag
** {{nbt|string|parent}}: Loads a different model from the given path, in form of a [[Tutorial:Models#File_path|resource location]]. If both <code>"parent"</code> and <code>"elements"</code> are set, the <code>"elements"</code> tag overrides the <code>"elements"</code> tag from the previous model.
*** Can be set to <code>"builtin/generated"</code> to use a model that is created out of the specified icon. Only the first layer is supported, and rotation can be achieved only by using block states files.
** {{nbt|bool|ambientocclusion}}: Whether to use {{wikipedia|ambient occlusion}} (<code>true</code> - default), or not (<code>false</code>).
** {{nbt|compound|display}}: Holds the different places where item models are displayed.
*** {{nbt|compound|''Position''}}: Named <code>thirdperson_righthand</code>, <code>thirdperson_lefthand</code>, <code>firstperson_righthand</code>, <code>firstperson_lefthand</code>, <code>gui</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>ground</code>, or <code>fixed</code>. Place where an item model is displayed. Holds its rotation, translation and scale for the specified situation. '''fixed''' refers to item frames, while the rest are as their name states. Translations are applied to the model before rotations.
**** {{nbt|list|rotation}}: Specifies the rotation of the model according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>.
**** {{nbt|list|translation}}: Specifies the position of the model according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. The values are clamped between -80 and 80.
**** {{nbt|list|scale}}: Specifies the scale of the model according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. If the value is greater than 4, it is displayed as 4.
** {{nbt|compound|textures}}: Holds the textures of the model, in form of a [[Tutorial:Models#File_path|resource location]] or can be another texture variable.
*** {{nbt|string|particle}}: What texture to load particles from. This texture is also used as an overlay if you are in a [[nether portal]], and used for [[water]] and [[lava]]'s still textures.<ref>{{bug|MC-240042||Water and lava textures are defined through the model particle parameter}}</ref> This texture is also considered a texture variable that can be referenced as <code>"#particle"</code>. Note: All breaking particles from non-model blocks are hard-coded, such as for [[barrier]]s.{{verify|I remember changing this before and it worked just fine}}
*** {{nbt|string|''Texture variable''}}: Defines a texture variable and assigns a texture.
** {{nbt|list|elements}}: Contains all the elements of the model. They can have only cubic forms. If both <code>"parent"</code> and <code>"elements"</code> are set, the <code>"elements"</code> tag overrides the <code>"elements"</code> tag from the previous model.
*** {{nbt|compound}} An element.
**** {{nbt|list|from}}: Start point of a cuboid according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. Values must be between -16 and 32.
**** {{nbt|list|to}}: Stop point of a cuboid according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. Values must be between -16 and 32.
**** {{nbt|compound|rotation}}: Defines the rotation of an element.
***** {{nbt|list|origin}}: Sets the center of the rotation according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>.
***** {{nbt|float|x}}: Specifies the angle of rotation around the <code>x</code> axis. This value will be ignored if an <code>axis</code> and <code>angle</code> are specified.
***** {{nbt|float|y}}: Specifies the angle of rotation around the <code>y</code> axis. This value will be ignored if an <code>axis</code> and <code>angle</code> are specified.
***** {{nbt|float|z}}: Specifies the angle of rotation around the <code>z</code> axis. This value will be ignored if an <code>axis</code> and <code>angle</code> are specified.
***** {{nbt|string|axis}}: Specifies the direction of rotation, can be <code>"x"</code>, <code>"y"</code> or <code>"z"</code>.
***** {{nbt|float|angle}}: Specifies the angle of rotation.
***** {{nbt|bool|rescale}}: Specifies whether or not to scale the faces across the whole block by scaling the non-rotated faces by  <code>1 / cos(angle)</code>. Can be true or false. Defaults to false.
**** {{nbt|bool|shade}}: Defines if the faces of the element should be shaded according to their orientation (<code>true</code> - default) or not (<code>false</code>). This does not affect ambient occlusion or shading based on light level.
**** {{nbt|int|light_emission}}: Defines the minimum light level that the element can receive. Can be 0-15, defaults to 0.
**** {{nbt|compound|faces}}: Holds all the faces of the cuboid. If a face is left out, it does not render.
***** {{nbt|compound|''Face''}}: Named <code>down</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>north</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>west</code> or <code>east</code>. Contains the properties of the specified face.
****** {{nbt|list|uv}}: Defines the area of the texture to use according to the scheme <code>[x1, y1, x2, y2]</code>. The texture behavior is inconsistent if UV extends below 0 or above 16. If the numbers of <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> are swapped (e.g. from <code>0, 0, 16, 16</code> to <code>16, 0, 0, 16</code>), the texture flips. UV is optional, and if not supplied it automatically generates based on the element's position. 
****** {{nbt|string|texture}}: Specifies the texture in form of the texture variable prepended with a <code>#</code>.
****** {{nbt|string|cullface}}: Specifies whether a face does not need to be rendered when there is a block touching it in the specified position. The position can be: <code>down</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>north</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>west</code>, or <code>east</code>. It also determines the side of the block to use the light level from for lighting the face, and if unset, defaults to the side.
****** {{nbt|int|rotation}}: Rotates the texture clockwise by the specified number of degrees (counterclockwise for the 'down' face). Can be 0, 90, 180, or 270. Defaults to 0. Rotation does not affect which part of the texture is used. Instead, it amounts to permutation of the selected texture vertexes (selected implicitly, or explicitly though <code>uv</code>).
****** {{nbt|int|tintindex}}: Determines whether to tint the texture using a hardcoded tint index. The default value, -1, indicates not to use the tint. Any other number is provided to BlockColors to get the tint value corresponding to that index. However, most blocks do not have a tint value defined (in which case white is used). Furthermore, no vanilla block currently uses multiple tint values, and thus the tint index value is ignored (as long as it is set to something other than -1); it could be used for modded blocks that need multiple distinct tint values in the same block though.

== Item models ==
<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}}: The root tag
**{{nbt|string|parent}}: Loads a different model from the given path, in form of a [[Tutorial:Models#File path|resource location]]. If both <code>"parent"</code> and <code>"elements"</code> are set, the <code>"elements"</code> tag overrides the <code>"elements"</code> tag from the previous model.
*** Can be set to <code>"item/generated"</code> to use a model that is created out of the specified icon.
*** Can be set to <code>"builtin/entity"</code> to load a model from an entity file. As you cannot specify the entity, this does not work for all items (only for [[chest]]s, [[ender chest]]s, [[mob head]]s, [[shield]]s, [[banner]]s and [[trident]]s).
** {{nbt|compound|display}}: Holds the different places where item models are displayed.
*** {{nbt|compound|''Position''}}: Named <code>thirdperson_righthand</code>, <code>thirdperson_lefthand</code>, <code>firstperson_righthand</code>, <code>firstperson_lefthand</code>, <code>gui</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>ground</code>, <code>fixed</code>, or <code>on_shelf</code>. Place where an item model is displayed. Holds its rotation, translation and scale for the specified situation. '''fixed''' refers to item frames, while the rest are as their name states. Translations are applied to the model before rotations. If this is specified but not all of translation, rotation and scale are in it, the others aren't inherited from the parent.
**** {{nbt|list|rotation}}: Specifies the rotation of the model according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>.
**** {{nbt|list|translation}}: Specifies the position of the model according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. If the value is greater than 80, it is displayed as 80. If the value is less than -80, it is displayed as -80.
**** {{nbt|list|scale}}: Specifies the scale of the model according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. If the value is greater than 4, it is displayed as 4.
** {{nbt|compound|textures}}: Holds the textures of the model, in form of a [[Tutorial:Models#File_path|resource location]] or can be another texture variable.
*** {{nbt|string|layer''N''}}: Used only to specify the icon of the item used in the inventory. There can be more than just one layer (e.g. for [[leather armor]] and [[Smithing|trimmed armor]]), but the amount of possible layers is hardcoded for each item.{{verify|It seems like it is 4 (5 when including layer0) layers maximum for all items.}} Works only in combination with <code>"item/generated"</code>. 
*** {{nbt|string|particle}}: What texture to load particles from. Used to determine the "crumb" particles generated by food items, as well as to determine the [[barrier]] particle (but it always uses <code>items/barrier.png</code> as blockbreaking particle), which otherwise uses "layer0".
*** {{nbt|string|''Texture variable''}}: Defines a texture variable and assigns a texture.
** {{nbt|string|gui_light}}: Can be <code>"front"</code> or <code>"side"</code>. If set to <code>"side"</code>, the model is rendered like a block. If set to <code>"front"</code>, model is shaded like a flat item. Defaults to <code>"side"</code>.
** {{nbt|list|elements}}: Contains all the elements of the model. They can have only cubic forms. If both <code>"parent"</code> and <code>"elements"</code> are set, the <code>"elements"</code> list overrides the <code>"elements"</code> list from the parent model.
*** {{nbt|compound}} An element.
**** {{nbt|list|from}}: Start point of a cuboid according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. Values must be between -16 and 32.
**** {{nbt|list|to}}: Stop point of a cuboid according to the scheme <code>[x, y, z]</code>. Values must be between -16 and 32.
**** {{nbt|compound|rotation}}: Defines the rotation of an element.

***** {{nbt|string|axis}}: Specifies the direction of rotation, can be <code>"x"</code>, <code>"y"</code> or <code>"z"</code>.
***** {{nbt|float|angle}}: Specifies the angle of rotation. Can be 45 through -45 degrees.
***** {{nbt|bool|rescale}}: Specifies whether or not to scale the faces across the whole block. Can be true or false. Defaults to false.
**** {{nbt|bool|shade}}: Defines if the faces of the element should be shaded according to their orientation (<code>true</code> - default) or not (<code>false</code>). This does not affect ambient occlusion or shading based on light level.
**** {{nbt|int|light_emission}}: Defines the minimum light level that the element can receive. Can be 0-15, defaults to 0.
**** {{nbt|compound|faces}}: Holds all the faces of the cuboid. If a face is left out, it does not render.
***** {{nbt|compound|''Face''}}: Named <code>down</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>north</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>west</code> or <code>east</code>. Contains the properties of the specified face.
****** {{nbt|list|uv:}} Defines the area of the texture to use according to the scheme <code>[x1, y1, x2, y2]</code>. If unset, it defaults to values equal to xyz position of the element. The texture behavior is inconsistent if UV extends below 0 or above 16. If the numbers of <code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> are swapped (e.g. from <code>0, 0, 16, 16</code> to <code>16, 0, 0, 16</code>), the texture flips. UV is optional, and if not supplied it automatically generates based on the element's position. 
****** {{nbt|string|texture:}} Specifies the texture in form of the texture variable prepended with a <code>#</code>.
****** {{nbt|string|cullface:}} Specifies whether a face does not need to be rendered when there is a block touching it in the specified position. The position can be: <code>down</code>, <code>up</code>, <code>north</code>, <code>south</code>, <code>west</code>, or <code>east</code>. It also determines the side of the block to use the light level from for lighting the face, and if unset, defaults to the side.
****** {{nbt|int|rotation}}: Rotates the texture by the specified number of degrees. Can be 0, 90, 180, or 270. Defaults to 0. Rotation does not affect which part of the texture is used. Instead, it amounts to permutation of the selected texture vertexes (selected implicitly, or explicitly though <code>uv</code>).
****** {{nbt|int|tintindex}}: Tints the texture on that face using a tint value referenced from the [[Items model definition#model|Items model definition]]. If no tint color (or the color white) is provided, the texture isn't tinted.
** {{nbt|list|overrides}}: As of [[24w45a | 24w45a]]/[[1.21.4 | 1.21.4]]+, overrides have been removed & replaced with a new system. Documentation for it can be found [[Items_model_definition | here]].

== Fields used by Blockbench ==
Some models contain fields used by Blockbench due to Mojang utilizing the software, these fields are only used by Blockbench and aren't used by ''Minecraft''.

* {{nbt|string|name}}: Name of an element (found in element objects).
* {{nbt|int array|texture_size}}: 2D Integer array defining the width and height of the texture(s) being used (found at the root object).

== Uses of models ==
{{info needed section|

== Limitations ==

=== Objects that cannot be remodelled ===
{{info needed section|Objects needing testing:
* Trident
* Is the shield model hardcoded and non-customizable, even if the shield item definition isn't required to point to it?}}
While most blocks and items can have their model changed, there are a multitude of things that cannot.

For example, no entities (with the exception of [[item frame]]s and [[glow item frame]]s) can have their model changed {{in|JE}} with resource packs alone. [[Bell]]s can have their attachment model changed but not the bell model itself.

==== Blocks and fluids ====
{{Non-remodellable blocks}}

Even these blocks have particle textures defined in dedicated model files, however it still stands that actual visual models cannot be changed.

Sub-elements of blocks, such as passively emitted particles and the book on top of the [[enchanting table]], cannot be modified, even though the base block can.

== History ==
{{needs updating|
* When were "texture overlays" like those used for a grass block added and removed? Pretty sure is in 14w25a, since that version made the sides of grass blocks its own element
* Nearly everything after 1.9 is missing
* e.g. minimum_light
* Document the early format more as well. Some things are omitted here, such as "inventoryRender3D"
* When were item display types first implemented? They don't appear to exist in 14w25a}}
