A '''breeze''' is a [[hostile mob]] spawned by certain [[trial spawner]]s found in [[trial chambers]]. It moves via jumping large distances when attacking, attacks by firing [[wind charge]]s, and deflects all projectiles that hit it except wind charges. Breezes are the only source of [[breeze rod]]s, which are dropped upon death.

== Spawning ==
Breezes [[Mob spawning|spawn]] from [[trial spawner]]s that generate surrounded by [[chiseled tuff]] in [[trial chambers]]. These trial spawners only generate in combat chambers, and never in the corridors. Only one breeze spawner can generate in each combat chamber, and it is usually in the center of the room.

Breezes can spawn only in places with line of sight to the trial spawner that spawns them.

== Drops ==
=== On death ===
{{DropTable
|{{DropLine|name=Breeze Rod|notes=player_or_pet|quantity=1-2|lootingquantity=1-2}}
}}

{{xp|10}} [[experience]] orbs are dropped if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].

== Behavior ==
[[File:Breeze in the Air.png|thumb|A breeze jumping through the air.]]
A breeze leaps around between firing [[wind charge]]s at its target. Before jumping, it compresses itself like a spring and can jump up to 15 blocks horizontally and 5 blocks vertically. If the breeze is in [[lava]], it can jump only one block into the air. Breezes are immune to all [[fall damage]].

Breezes automatically deflect all projectiles that hit them except [[wind charge]]s. Unlike [[shield]]s, deflected projectiles maintain the same velocity, and can potentially harm the attacker or other [[entities]]. Breezes are unable to deflect the blast radius of [[splash potion]]s or [[firework rocket]]s, which affect them like any other mob if they are in range of the blast.

Breezes are partially unaffected by the [[Invisibility]] effect. The eyebrows and surrounding wind remain visible.{{Only|Java}}

Breezes do not retaliate if attacked by mobs that can spawn from trial spawners ([[zombie]]s, [[husk]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[bogged]], [[stray]]s, [[spider]]s, [[cave spider]]s, and [[slime]]s). These mobs also do not retaliate if hit by a breeze's wind charge.

Breezes actively pursue and attack [[iron golem]]s.

Breezes can rotate themselves while in a boat. They are the only mobs that can do this.

Breezes float upwards in [[water]] and [[lava]] exceptionally faster than all other mobs.{{Only|Java}} 

=== Wind charge ===
{{main|Wind Charge}}
Breezes attempt to shoot a [[wind charge]] at a player or enemy within a distance of 16 blocks, with a cooldown of 32 game ticks (1.6 seconds) between attempts. When a breeze's wind charge attack directly hits an [[entity]], the entity takes [[damage]], and a burst of wind appears. If a wind charge hits a [[block]], only a burst of wind appears. This wind burst deals [[Knockback_(mechanic)|knockback]] but does not deal any damage by itself; instead, it often deals damage by making the [[entity]] fall a high distance. The wind burst can also interact with blocks, toggling block states of ''non-iron'' [[door]]s and [[trapdoor]]s, [[button]]s, [[lever]]s, and [[fence gate]]s, as well as extinguishing lit [[candle]]s. Such block interactions are potential threats in [[trial chambers]], but can be controlled by the <code>mobGriefing</code> [[game rule]]. [[Bell]]s can also be rung if hit by the wind burst, which is not affected by the <code>mobGriefing</code> game rule.

Wind charges can be deflected if hit with another projectile or a melee attack, similar to ghast [[fireball]]s.

== Trivia ==
* Regarding a change made to prevent breezes from drowning while swimming, a changelog for a ''Bedrock Edition'' Preview said that breezes breathe through their eyes rather than their "feet".<ref name=lore>{{mcnet|minecraft-preview-1-20-80-22|Minecraft Preview 1.20.80.22|March 14, 2024|Matt Gartzke}}</ref> This is referring to how eye height defines drowning height for most [[mob]]s.
* During the design process to determine how the breeze would look, the developers reportedly sat in a room for half a day sketching and throwing out designs.<ref>{{ytl|1CPKe6ynKE4|ALL ABOUT TRICKY TRIALS MOBS & ITEMS @ 0:44|Minecraft|June 11, 2024|t=44}}</ref> One of the designs they came up with was a "strider with really long legs wearing cowboy pants".<ref>{{ytl|1CPKe6ynKE4|ALL ABOUT TRICKY TRIALS MOBS & ITEMS @ 0:53|Minecraft|June 11, 2024|t=53}}</ref>
* While Tom Olovsson was designing the breeze's sounds he tried using {{w|granular synthesis|newtab=1}} to create the whoosh sounds, but mis-clicked while trying to load in a specific file and loaded in a bunch of different "whoosh" sounds instead, and he felt this was actually the right sound for the breeze.<ref>{{ytl|1CPKe6ynKE4|ALL ABOUT TRICKY TRIALS MOBS & ITEMS @ 1:20|Minecraft|June 11, 2024|t=80}}</ref>
