MINECON 2013 featured an official costume contest and an official build contest, marking the last time these contests were held. Contestant ''fyrflies'' placed in both the Build Contest and the Costume Contest.

=== Build Contest ===
The build contest theme was "Halloween", reflecting the proximity to the holiday. The contest ran weeks before the convention, with winners announced at the closing ceremony. ''Tewkesape/theo_the_ape'' was the only participant to place in the top three for both the 2013 and 2012 build contests.

== Controversies ==
=== Ticket sales ===
Mojang and their ticket vendor, [http://www.eventbrite.com/home/ Eventbrite], faced criticism for the ticket sales system. The rapid sell-out of tickets (the first batch in three seconds) and technical issues with the "Pending" status during checkout led to widespread complaints. A [http://www.change.org/petitions/mojang-ab-minecon-2013-ticket-failure-sell-minecon-2013-tickets-at-the-door?utm_campaign=signature_receipt&utm_medium=email&utm_source=share_petition Change.org petition] was created in response.

=== Age restriction ===
Mojang initially set the age restriction at 17 years old (16 and under with an adult). After reconsideration, the restriction was lowered to 14 years old (13 and under with an adult). Refunds were offered for those affected, and returned tickets were resold.<ref name="Con2013" />
