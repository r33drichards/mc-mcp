[[File:Vibrant Visuals.png|thumb|A screenshot showing many of the features in Vibrant Visuals.]]
'''Vibrant Visuals''' is a [[graphics]] mode that aims to improve the visual looks of ''Minecraft'' by adding directional lighting, physically based textures, pixel-aligned shadows, atmospheric sky, environmental effects, and various other visual features based on {{w|photorealism}}. It is built around a {{w|physically based rendering}} pipeline used for [[w:Deferred shading|deferred lighting]] and {{w|ray tracing}}.<ref name="vibrant-visuals">{{Cite|title=Vibrant Visuals|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/introvibrantvisuals?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref><ref>{{cite Discord

Most configurations and textures can be customized using [[resource packs]], and various tagged [[Marketplace]] add-ons make use of custom Vibrant Visuals packs.

Vibrant Visuals affects only the graphical appearance of ''[[Minecraft]]''; it does not affect gameplay. However, enabling Vibrant Visuals on lower-end devices (especially with high render distance and higher graphics settings) can decrease game performance significantly, which can affect the game experience.

== Features ==

=== Physically based rendering ===
[[File:Dark vibrant comparison.jpg|thumb|A comparison of the default and Vibrant Visuals textures, outside a [[woodland mansion]].]]
Vibrant Visuals uses {{w|physically based rendering}} (PBR), which simulates realistic lighting behaviors between different surface materials. This is achieved by creating different texture maps for every [[block]], [[entity]], [[item]], and [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particle]], which define specific characteristics of the surface material.<ref name="texture-map">{{Cite|title=Overview of Physically Based Rendering|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/pbroverview?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> A texture set is used to specify these texture maps in a [[resource pack]].<ref name="texture-set">{{Cite|title=Texture Set JSON and Introduction to Texture Sets|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/reference/content/texturesetsreference/texturesetsconcepts/texturesetsintroduction?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> Four maps &mdash; metalness, emissive, roughness, and subsurface scattering (collectively known as MERS) &mdash; define the material's properties. Each property in MERS is assigned to RGBA image (four channel), such as red to metalness, green to emissive, blue to roughness, and alpha to subsurface.

==== Reflections ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals PBR reflections.png|left|thumb|width=250x250|Metallic surfaces like [[Block of Copper|copper]] fully reflect sunlight and emissive light, smooth surfaces like [[Smooth Quartz Block|smooth quartz]] and [[bricks]] only reflect sunlight, and rough surfaces like [[wood]] reflect nothing.]]
Object reflections are heavily affected by their metalness and roughness properties. Metallic surfaces reflect light directly and tint that reflection with their own color (like [[gold]] and [[copper]]). Non-metallic surfaces like [[grass]], [[dirt]], and [[tree]] barks show more solid color and less reflection. A surface with low roughness is very smooth, resulting in sharp, mirror-like reflections, compared with high roughness that results in blurry, diffused reflections.
[[File:Zuri's vibrant boat ride.jpg|thumb|right|Reflections on the surface of water.]]
[[File:Vibrant Visuals reflection quality comparison.gif|thumb|The amount of blocks reflected depends on the "Reflections" setting.]]
The game uses {{w|screen space reflections}} (SSR) and {{w|image-based lighting}} (IBL) to create dynamic reflections which appear on these surfaces.<ref name="lighting">{{Cite|title=Light Sources|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/lightingcustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> SSR generates reflections by reusing what's already visible on the screen. They are limited by the objects and parts of the world that are currently visible in the camera's view, which can cause reflections to fade or disappear near the edges of the screen. In contrast, IBL reflections, used to reflect [[cloud]]s, aren't limited by what is already displayed on the screen but often appear low resolution and distorted. They use {{w|cube maps}}, which are affected by environmental lighting and atmospheric scattering.<ref name=":0" />

Most blocks and entities in Vibrant Visuals with high metalness only reflect light sources and do not completely mirror areas. [[Water]] surfaces are fully reflective and properly mirror the area surrounding them. The reflection quality can be configured under the [[Settings#Vibrant Visuals Options|video settings]], which affects their resolution and distance at which they appear.

==== Surface glows ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals emissive textures.png|thumb|Various emissive textures in a cave.]]
Pixels can appear to glow in the dark environment through the emissive texture map. This map defines which parts of a texture should be self-illuminated. It uses the green color channel in the MERS texture; areas of the map that are solid green will glow at full intensity, with different shades of the color affecting their intensity, while black areas will be unaffected by the emissive property. Emissive surfaces do not cast light onto surrounding blocks or entities, and therefore do not cast proper shadows. However, their glow remains visible even in complete darkness, making them appear bright and distinct. They also produce light bloom effect, which makes their color bleed into the surrounding areas.

Some entities and blocks &mdash; like [[drowned]], [[spider]]s, [[sculk]], certain [[Item (entity)|dropped items]], and [[firefly bush|firefly particles]] &mdash; use emissive texture map and produce glowing effect. This effect is often contributed by their natural block [[lighting]] (like [[torch]]es and [[glowstone]]), which makes the glow appear more intense and realistic. 

==== Subsurface scattering ====
The fourth map, subsurface scattering, simulates an effect of light shining on translucent surfaces, like [[leaves]].<ref name=":1" /> This effect is applied to blocks exposed to sky lighting, and blends to roughly one block deep on vertical surfaces. Subsurface scattering cannot be used in conjunction with metalness on the same pixel on an object; instead, only one effect will be applied.

=== Directional lighting and shadows ===
[[File:Sunlight Vibrant Visuals.png|left|thumb|Pixelated shadows created by the sun on all objects.]]
The primary light sources in Vibrant Visuals are global directional lights, including the [[sun]] and the [[moon]] in the [[Overworld]], and [[End flash|End flashes]] in the [[End]].<ref name="lighting" /> Depending on the location of the light source in the sky, they illuminate all objects directly exposed to them. The texture maps define how this affects objects, such as how the light is reflected and recolored. Light also shines through [[Glass pane|glass panes]] and other supported transparent blocks, where it has the same effects on objects behind it.  

When the camera is looking at a bright object, either directional lighting or emissive textures, the whole view gets darkened, which gradually fades away when looking at a dark object.  

Directional light sources cast shadows on all objects, including held items on the [[HUD]]. The object that creates the shadow and the location of the light source affect the shape, size, and direction of the shadow. Unlike shadows in most games, shadows are pixelated to match the resolution of other textures and align with the pixel grid. Shadows can be created by any block that can obstruct lighting, most [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particles]], and entities, including [[players]]. Animated objects, like animated player [[skins]] or the tentacles of a [[ghast]], create animated shadows as well. Shadows are rendered at a lower quality at higher distances, which can be configured in the settings.  

==== End flash ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals End flash.gif|thumb|A flash in the End. Notice the shadows created by [[chorus plants]].]]The End flash is an effect in the [[End sky]] exclusive to Vibrant Visuals. End flashes occur once every 30 seconds at random spots above the horizon. As a directional light source, End flashes tint block lighting purple and create shadow and reflection effects. Each flash lasts between 5 and 19 seconds, with fading at the beginning and the end, while also producing a [[sound]]. Flashes can be disabled in the [[Settings#Accessibility|accessibility settings]].

==== Colored lighting<span class="anchor" id="Point lighting"></span> ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals point lights comparison.png|thumb|Point lights off (top) and on (bottom).]]If the "[[Render Dragon Features for Creators]]" experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', and "point lights" are turned on in the settings, light-emitting blocks like [[Torch|torches]] emit directional light and cast dynamic shadows as well. The light is emitted from a single point at the center of a block, hence the name, and the strength is affected by the block's [[lighting]]. This light is colored, and blends additively. The following blocks are affected by point lighting:

The quality of point lighting and the shadows created by point lights can be adjusted in the settings, or turned off.

Enabling this for more objects may reduce the performance and affect gameplay noticeably.
[[File:Vibrant Visuals light colors.png|thumb|All different light colors, from both point lighting and static lighting.]]
In addition to point lighting, all other blocks with block lighting create static colored light. For a full list of colors, see {{Slink|Light|Light-emitting blocks}}.

==== Other light sources ====
Without directional light sources, objects are lit by ambient lighting, to prevent them from rendering pitch black. Ambient lighting has a [[dimension]]-dependent strength (0.02 in the [[Overworld]], 0.5 in the [[Nether]], and 0.125 in the [[End]]), which affects objects based on the texture sets. For example, blocks have a red tint in the Nether, where no directional lighting is available.

The [[sky]] also contributes as a light source, which can also be reflected by objects. Depending on the exposure to sky light, shadows created by directional lighting can appear darker and more visible or blend in more with bright areas.

=== Environmental effects ===
Each [[biome]] and [[dimension]] has unique effects for lighting and color that greatly affect the scene. Biome-dependent effects include atmospherics, color grading, fog, and lighting (excluding point lights). In transitions between biomes, the game automatically blends the effects.<ref name=":2" />

==== Atmospherics ====
The [[sky]] color of a biome in Vibrant Visuals is defined at the horizon and the zenith, which are variable.<ref name=":3" /> When these colors are different, the sky will blend these colors between the horizon and the zenith. For example, [[deserts]] and [[badlands]] have a light orange/green sky color, snowy biomes have a light blue or white sky color, and pale gardens have a gray sky color. The color and intensity of sunlight and moonlight are affected by the biome as well.

Different [[Vibrant Visuals#Post processing effects|color grading]] settings distinguish biomes with different temperatures, making especially cold biomes appear gray/blue, and warm biomes colored orange. Color grading is applied as a post-processing effect to the whole image, including blocks, light, and the sky.[[File:Vibrant Visuals volumetric fog comparison.png|thumb|Volumetric fog turned off (top) and set to Ultra (bottom) in a [[Pale Garden|pale garden]].|width=314x314]]
Vibrant Visuals enhances all [[fog]] effects that change depending on the environment.<ref name=":4" /> Certain biomes, like swamps and pale gardens, have denser volumetric fog effects with unique colors and strength depending on the height, and directional lighting. Directional lighting can be scattered by strong fog, and the heaviest fog can greatly lower the view distance to only a few chunks, or even block the sun entirely. With decreased effects from directional lighting, shadows and reflections are less visible, and blocks in the distance appear half-transparent and faded. Volumetric fog can be disabled in the settings, and the quality of light shafts and distance fading can be adjusted. With the [https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Henyey-greenstein_phase_function Henyey-Greenstein G phase function], Vibrant Visuals fog can create light shafts for scattering in air and water.

Most biomes, including [[unused biomes]], use default settings for fog, atmospherics, lighting, and color grading, or share a common setting with a specific climate, while some biomes have unique settings. 

* Fog types are split into default, semi-humid, and humid. For a full list of biomes using semi-humid and humid fog, see {{Slink|Fog|Volumetric fog}}.
* Color grading is split into default, warmish, coolish, and cold.
* Atmospherics and lighting are split into default and warmish. Biomes with cold or coolish color grading use default atmospherics and lighting.

* The [[End sky]] uses unique black/purple atmospherics, but this is rendered on top of the End sky texture, and a dense purple volumetric fog effect is visible during an End flash. The End has unique lighting, but default color grading.
* The sky in all [[Nether]] biomes uses the same colors as without Vibrant Visuals, with the exception that the zenith is slightly brighter than the horizon, different for each biome. All Nether biomes use the same lighting and default color grading.
* [[Swamps]], [[Mushroom Fields|mushroom fields]], [[Ice Spikes|ice spikes]], [[pale gardens]], and [[Dark Forest|dark forests]] all have unique fog, lighting, atmospherics, and color grading settings.
* [[Deserts]] and all [[badlands]] have two unique lighting, atmospherics, and color grading settings, but use default volumetric fog.
* [[Mangrove swamps]] have unique lighting, atmospherics, and color grading but use humid fog.
* [[Lush Caves|Lush caves]] use warmish color grading and humid fog, but default atmospherics and lighting.

</gallery>[[File:Vibrant Visuals sun beams.png|thumb|Sunbeams and different sky colors during sunrise.]]Global directional light sources are affected by [[W:Rayleigh scattering|rayleigh scattering]] and [[W:Mie scattering|mie scattering]], which change depending on the object's position in the sky. The sun and moon themselves create a glow in the sky around them, and cast light beams depending on fog effects. These light beams can fall through transparent blocks, and can be scattered into smaller light beams with shadows by blocks and entities.

All atmospheric effects gradually change during the [[time of day]], for example certain scattering effects only apply during sunrise or sunset, and the sky and sun colors are constantly changing. During sunrise, sky colors gradually change from black with weak light from the moon and stars, to a more vibrant light created by the sun and changed by the atmosphere. The sunrise and sunset also change the color of sunlight to a more orange/red color, which gradually fades away during the day.

==== Clouds ====
[[File:Vibrant Visuals clouds.png|thumb|Clouds with Vibrant Visuals. Note the shadows.]]
[[Clouds]] have more detail and additional light on the edges, making large clouds appear much darker than smaller clouds. Furthermore, clouds can block sunlight or moonlight and cast shadows on the ground. When a cloud covers the sun or moon, the sky and the environment darken and change colors. The color of clouds also changes with sky colors, for example, in different biomes, and during weather events.

The cloud distance can be adjusted in the Vibrant Visuals options.

==== Weather effects ====
[[File:Rain Vibrant Visuals.png|thumb|Rainfall in a forest, where the sky is tinted slightly more yellow than without Vibrant Visuals.]]
[[File:Snowfall Vibrant Visuals.png|thumb|Snowfall with Vibrant Visuals, with a bright glow in the sky.]]
The [[weather]] influences environmental light effects to make them match more with the set colors of classic graphics modes. During [[rainfall]], the sky appears dark grey, but the biome effects still partially apply, making rain look unique for every biome. Thunderstorms increase this effect and make the sky even darker. During [[snowfall]], the sky turns into a unique shade of light gray with biome effects much less visible. During a combination of snowfall and thunder, the sky is much darker at the horizon, but the light blue/light gray colors are still visible higher in the sky. The sun and moon are not visible during weather events, and don't cast shadows on blocks or entities. However, at the location of the sun and moon, a brighter glow is visible in the sky.

In dry biomes, rainfall does not affect sky or clouds at all and is indistinguishable from clear weather, unlike without Vibrant Visuals. Thunderstorms slightly darken the sky and clouds, but the sun and moon are still visible and appear darker.

Volumetric fog effects are heavily increased during rain, snowfall, or thunderstorms, and change their colors according to the sky color. The regular biome fog is unaffected.

==== Water effects ====
The [[water]] texture and inside color are rendered separately from other blocks and objects.<ref name=":5" /> Small bodies of water appear almost invisible, and large bodies are more transparent in general, with a less saturated blue color compared to classic graphics modes. Biome-specific water colors are not applied to the surface, but this has been announced to be added in a future update.<ref>{{Mcnet|evolving-vibrant-visuals-for-bedrock-edition|Evolving Vibrant Visuals for Bedrock Edition|November 7, 2025|Sophie Austin}}</ref>

When the player's eye level is inside water, volumetric fog effects are created, which change depending on the depth, the time the player has been in the water, the biome, and sky effects. Without sky light underwater, the fog color is pitch black, and the only light created by the blocks is much less effective. When the player is in an underwater area without a skylight, looking at an area exposed to a skylight, the textures of blocks are not visible, and everything is colored cyan.

The sun and moon aren't visible from below the water, but a blurred and colored light source can be seen in the direction of the sun and moon, and creates light beams falling through the water. These light beams can be obstructed and scattered by objects and fog effects. When directional lighting hits a surface underwater, water caustics are projected on that surface. Water caustics are randomly animated, and certain parts appear brighter than others, depending on the light projecting the water caustics.<gallery>

=== Post processing effects ===
Post-processing effects are visual elements that are not directly produced by either PBR or direct lighting sources, but are instead applied after the scene is fully rendered. There are multiple post-processing effects applied by Vibrant Visuals, such as:
* '''Bloom''' which appears on emissive textures and light sources. It creates a soft and hazy aura of light around the glowing object, with the colors bleeding out around the object. The effect's intensity can be configured on the [[Settings#Vibrant Visuals Options|video settings]].
* '''Upscaling''' which is done from low-resolution scene renders. The game usually renders the scene at a lower resolution and upscales it to the native resolution to improve video performance. This effect can be configured on the video settings, where the player can set between ''TAAU'' ([[W:Temporal anti-aliasing|Temporal Anti-Aliasing]] Upsampling) and ''[[W:Bilinear interpolation|Bilinear]]'' mode, and the final resolution quality. Generally, TAAU makes the game use multiple frames to create a crisper upscaled frame, while Bilinear stretches the frame to fit the screen, more suitable for low-end devices.
* '''Color grading''' which controls the saturation, contrast, gain, gamma, and offset of the final scene.<ref name="color-grading-tone-mapping">{{cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/colorgradingtonemappingcustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Color Grading and Tone Mapping|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref>
** There are three parameters that apply the effects based on the pixels' brightness condition: shadows (darkest pixels); highlights (brightest pixels); and midtones (pixels close to the average luminescence of the scene), each increasing or decreasing the five effects for red, green, and blue.
** There is an additional '''temperature-based color grading''' which makes the scene look "warmer" with more yellow and orange colors, and "cooler" with more blue color.
** 14 different color grading effects are applied based on the [[biome]].
* '''Tone mapping''' is also used to remap the colors from [[w:High dynamic range|HDR]] to [[w:Standard-dynamic-range video|SDR]] for televisions and monitors that support limited dynamic range.<ref name="color-grading-tone-mapping"/>

=== Panorama ===
An exclusive [[panorama]] is shown when using Vibrant Visuals.

== Applying ==
Vibrant Visuals can be toggled on in the [[Settings#Video|video settings]] in the [[Graphics settings|graphics]] mode dropdown menu. The graphics mode can only be changed in-game when "Allow In-Game Graphics Mode Switching" is turned on, but this can have negative impact on performance and not all devices support this.

If playing [[multiplayer]], not everyone needs to have it activated to play in the world; one player could have it activated, whilst other players could have it inactive since it's a local setting.

=== Vibrant Visuals options ===
{{Main|Settings#Vibrant Visuals Options}}
The quality of specific features from Vibrant Visuals as well as some technical options can be adjusted in the Vibrant Visuals options, below the graphics mode setting. These options can be preset to the "Favor Performance" for a better experience on lower-end devices, or "Favor Visuals" for a higher quality of Vibrant Visuals on high-end devices. The options can also be adjusted individually.

The [[Settings#Video|render distance]] for Vibrant Visuals is controlled by the "Deferred Render Distance" slider instead of the regular render distance slider. This slider can be set between 8-28 chunks (may be lower on some devices), but can be changed to any value chunks in [[options.txt]]. Higher render distances than 128 chunks will result in the game not loading any chunks further than 128 chunks away from the player, and even higher render distances can lead to glitched visual effects or crashes. Lower render distances than 8 chunks will result in the game not loading any chunks further away than the set render distance, but chunks won't be unloaded until they are further away than 8 chunks. A render distance of 0 chunks results in no chunks being loaded, but [[entities]] and [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particles]] are still visible.

The regular brightness setting is not available when using Vibrant Visuals, but the brightness can be calibrated in a separate menu in the Vibrant Visuals options. This also affects the brightness of the [[panorama]].

==== Configurations ====
All options related to Vibrant Visuals have configurations for specific devices. The [[Settings#Default|default settings]] for each preset, and the renderer configurations per setting differs between devices. The setting configurations can be found in {{File|directory|[[Bedrock Edition installation files|Content]]/data/renderer|inline=1}} as JSON files, with all renderer configurations located in a "lods" sub-directory. These files contain all available options per device, and a <code>platform_configuration.json</code> file contains all defaults for each generic graphics setting. There are separate configurations for three Android memory tiers, Xbox One (X) and Xbox Series X|S, all PS4 and PS5 consoles, three iOS devices memory tiers, and four Windows memory tiers.

There are also configurations for ChromeOS and Nintendo Switch, indicating that Vibrant Visuals may become available on those devices in the future.

This directory also contains configurations for features that are not customizable in resource packs, including tone mapping curves, deferred shading parameters, light clustering, luminance configurations, weather effects, <code>.bin</code> [https://wiki.bedrock.dev/visuals/materials material] files, and an unknown <code>brdf_lut.png</code> image, seemingly a [[colormap]].

Vibrant Visuals is not currently supported on ChromeOS devices, Fire tablets, or Nintendo Switch consoles. [[Mojang Studios]] intends to bring Vibrant Visuals, either fully or partially, to as many devices as possible.<ref name="article">{{mcnet|minecraft-vibrant-visuals|Vibrant Visuals|March 22, 2025}}</ref>

Some [[server]]s may disable Vibrant Visuals during the game using <code>disable-client-vibrant-visuals</code> in [[server.properties]], even when available on singleplayer. All [[featured server]]s besides ''[[The Hive]]'' and ''[[Mob Maze]]'' have disabled Vibrant Visuals, although this restriction can be circumvented by using third-party modification software.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://github.com/QYCottage/BetterRenderDragon|title=BetterRenderDragon|website=GitHub}}</ref> ''Minecraft'' [[Realms]] has Vibrant Visuals enabled.

Vibrant Visuals has limited compatibility with existing [[resource packs]] that are a part of an [[add-on]]. Resource packs without the <code>pbr</code> capability restrict the graphics mode to Fancy or lower. When a pack has <code>metadata.product_type</code> set to <code>addon</code> Vibrant Visuals can be enabled, regardless of the <code>pbr</code> capability. Custom textures from the add-on's resource pack default to 0% metalness, 0% emissiveness, 100% roughness, and 0% subsurface scattering.

== Customization ==
{{hatnote|1=For more detailed information and guides about customization, see [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/introvibrantvisuals?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable the official documentation].}}
[[File:Ore UI - Project Vibrant Visuals Settings Menu (Bedrock Editor).png|thumb|The Vibrant Visuals Settings in ''[[Bedrock Editor]]''.]]
Vibrant Visuals can be customized with a [[resource pack]]. A pack with <code>pbr</code> capability in its <code>[[manifest.json]]</code> can define PBR for each individual texture with a texture set.<ref>{{Cite|title=Vibrant Visuals Resource Packs|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/vvresourcepacks?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> They can also configure light sources, atmospheric effects, volumetric fog and light shafts, color grading and tone mapping, and many more.<ref name="vibrant-visuals" />

Vibrant Visuals is also compatible with resource packs that are designed for ray tracing (with <code>raytraced</code> capability). All ray tracing resource packs only support MER (metalness, emissive, and roughness) for its textures, and these can only be applied for blocks only.<ref name="texture-set" /> Vibrant Visuals resource packs however, support MER and subsurface scattering (MERS), and its textures can be applied for entities, mobs, particles, and items.

Global lighting, atmospherics, color grading, cubemaps, and water effects can be customized for each [[biome]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite|title=Biome Customization|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/biomecustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> Multiple JSON files can be stored in each directory as long as they have different names and identifiers, which are not the same as the global configurations. To apply settings to a biome, the identifier of the JSON file (in {{nbt|string|identifier}}) must be included in the [[Resource pack#Biomes|client biome JSON]] file in {{File|directory|biomes|inline=1}}, in the <code>minecraft:atmosphere_identifier</code>, <code>minecraft:color_grading_identifier</code>, <code>minecraft:cubemap_identifier</code>, <code>minecraft:fog_identifier</code>, <code>minecraft:lighting_identifier</code> and <code>minecraft:water_identifier</code> components, in strings with the same name without the namespace. The configurations will be blended automatically on biome borders, except for tone mapping, orbital offset, caustics, and waves enabled/disabled, which should use the same settings globally.

Resource packs that customize Vibrant Visuals can quickly be created with ''[[Bedrock Editor]]''. The Vibrant Visuals Settings window allows most configurations to be changed in a graphical environment, and a matching resource pack can be auto-generated. Biome-dependent settings cannot be changed.

=== Texture sets<!-- This will be moved to its own page at [[Texture set]], after a page on ray tracing has been made -->===
[[File:Vibrant Visuals subsurface scattering comparison.png|thumb|A comparison of leaves with (bottom) and without (top) subsurface scattering.]]
Textures from [[blocks]], [[entities]], [[items]] (held, displayed, and dropped), and [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particles]] use texture sets to calculate how light behaves on the texture, regarding reflections and emissiveness.<ref name="texture-map" /> Texture sets cannot be customized with ''Bedrock Editor''. On top of the regular RGBA [[Textures|texture]] maps, which control the colors and transparency, Vibrant Visuals uses six new maps for other properties of each pixel, including metalness, emissive, roughness, subsurface scattering, normal, and height maps. The first four are all created in one file, collectively known as MERS values (or MER without subsurface scattering).

* '''Metalness''' is a grayscale texture map that affect how metallic pixels look, which makes them more reflective. Pixels can use metalness values between black (non-metallic) and white (completely metalic), where metalness for values in between is affected by the brightness.
* The grayscale '''emissive''' map is used for pixels that emit light. Black pixels do not emit light at all, and any brighter values result in emissive textures. Pure white pixels are emissive at its brightest. The desaturation of the pixel's colors can be adjusted per biome in {{File|directory|lighting|inline=1}}.
* '''Subsurface scattering''' is an effect created by light shining on transcluent surfaces.<ref name=":1">{{Cite|title=Subsurface Scattering|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/subsurfacescatteringcustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> It is a grayscale map where brighter pixels allow more subsurface scattering. This texture map cannot be used in conjunction with the metalness map; if both are provided only the highest value will be applied (subsurface scattering when tied).
* '''Roughness''' is a grayscale texture map affecting how "rough" pixels are, which can block reflection effects. Black pixels are very smooth and allow all reflections caused by the metalness map, while white pixels only allow (distorted) light reflection.
* The [[W:Normal mapping|'''normal''' map]] is an RGB texture map which affect the depth of the pixel and how light rays are reflected. The ''RGB'' elements correspond to ''XYZ'' coordinates of the pixel, with (128, 128, 255) being completely flat.
* '''Height''' maps are similar to normal maps but in grayscale, allowing less possible textures. Black pixels appear to extrude inward to the object, and white pixels extrude outward. Combining black and white pixels next to each other can create height variation on which light can reflect, while creating a shadow behind. Heightmaps cannot be used together with normal maps.
Texture maps can be quickly created using [[Blockbench]],<ref>{{Cite|title=Use Blockbench to Create Vibrant Visuals Models|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/useblockbenchtocreatemodelswithtextures?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable}}</ref> which may require plugins to customize textures. The MERS textures need to be placed, preferably named <code>''[[Resource location|block/particle/entity/item ID]]''_mers</code> (or <code>_mer</code> if only using MER maps for compatibility with [[ray tracing]]), in {{File|directory|[[Resource pack|textures]]|inline=1}}, in the sub-directory containing textures for the object type. Texture maps can be stored in <code>.tga</code>, <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, and <code>.jpeg</code> formats. To make the game replace the default textures with a custom texture set, it needs to be specified in a texture set JSON file, on file for each texture, located in the same sub-directory as the texture itself.<ref name="texture-set" />

Instead of creating texture maps, the JSON file can also be used to apply specific MERS values to the whole texture.

==== Fallback values ====
When a resource pack does not contain one or more texture maps, the missing texture maps will default to the vanilla textures instead. However, for custom textures as part of an [[add-on]], all pixels default to values specified in a customizable JSON file in {{File|directory|pbr|inline=1}}.<ref>{{Cite|title=PBR uniforms|website=Microsoft Learn|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/lightingcustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable#pbr-uniforms}}</ref>

=== Lighting ===
Various types of light sources can be customized, which are split into global lighting and local lighting in the {{File|directory|lighting|inline=1}} and {{File|directory|local_lighting|inline=1}} directories.<ref name="lighting" /> Global light settings are defined per biome and require different JSON files for each biome or set of biomes and need to be specified in {{File|file|''biome''.client_biome.json|inline=1}}. Local light settings are applied for individual blocks specified in one JSON file. Local lighting currently only includes [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lights]], while global lighting includes directional lights, emissive textures, ambient light, and sky light.

* '''Directional lighting''' includes the [[sun]] and [[moon]] (orbital), and [[End flash]]. For each object, the total brightness can be adjusted, and the color of that lighting. This affects the sky and atmospheric scattering, and all objects lit by the directional light source, which are both also affected by texture sets, atmospheric settings, and color grading.
** All values for directional lighting in the JSON file and in ''Bedrock Editor'' support multiple key frames for different in-game times. See [[#Atmospherics 2|§ Atmospherics]] below for more information.
** [[File:Vibrant Visuals orbital offset.png|thumb|A custom orbital offset. Screenshot taken at noon.]]For the sun and the moon, the orbital offset can be customized, which affects how the orbit is rotated towards the south (can be rotated 360 degrees). This can also be keyframed, which allows to customize the position of the sun and moon depending on the in-game time.
* '''Emissive''' lights are produced by blocks, entities, and particles with emissive pixels in their texture set. The desaturation of the color of the pixel can be adjusted per biome.
* '''Ambient''' lighting is always applied and makes blocks visible when there are no other light sources. The strength and color of this light can be adjusted.
* '''Sky''' lighting is applied to surfaces exposed to the [[sky]]. The intensity can be adjusted, which affects how dark shadows are compared to surfaces lit by directional lighting.
* '''Static lights''' are local light sources set per [[block]], available only in the "Render Dragon Features for Creators" [[Experiments|experiment]] in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''. They do not create specular highlights or dynamic shadows and are fixed in space and in brightness. It can only be used by blocks with "regular" [[lighting]], which affects the strength. The color of this static light can be customized. When multiple static lights with different colors are overlapping in an area, the total luminance will add up.
* '''Point lights''' are local directional light sources in blocks, only available in the "Render Dragon Features for Creators" experiment. Point lights are created by a single point in the center of the block, with a specific color similar to the color for global directional lighting. Static lights are automatically also added to blocks with point lighting. The strength of the point light is affected by the [[Block light|block lighting]] of the block.

'''<code>global.json</code> format'''

Note: The <code>global.json</code> file does not override any vanilla lighting settings for non-custom biomes, each biome type requires its own JSON file such as <code>cold_lighting.json</code>.<div class="treeview">

=== Atmospherics ===
The colors and some other values for the sky can be changed in {{File|directory|atmospherics|inline=1}}.<ref name=":3">{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/atmosphericscustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Atmospheric Effects|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref> The atmospheric effects include separate horizon and zenith colors, mie scattering for the sun and moon, and rayleigh scattering. The horizon and zenith colors blend into each other depending on the specified heights for both colors. Mie scattering can also specify a height.

In this JSON file, all values can be individually key framed.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/keyframejsonsyntax?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Key Frame JSON Syntax|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref> Instead of providing a single value for a setting, the setting can be treated as an object with a set of values from the same type. The key is a number from 0 to 1 which represents the in-game [[time]], allowing to change atmospherics based on the time of day. The engine linearly interpolates between the values of the key frames, resulting in the actual atmospherics blending between specified times. A key of 0 is noon, 0.25 is sunset, 0.5 midnight, 0.75 sunrise, and 1 is the next noon.

[[File:Ore UI - Project Vibrant Visuals Settings Menu - Key Frame Graphs (Bedrock Editor).png|thumb|Some key framed settings in ''Bedrock Editor'' in different graphs.]]

In ''Bedrock Editor'', a set of different key frames can be adjusted individually. The amount of available key frames varies for each setting. With the slider below each graph, the key value for the X-axis can be seen. The Y-axis shows all values for the setting. Each key can be moved horizontally and vertically, and all keys are connected with a line corresponding to the linear interpolation. The colors do not support a color picker for each key, instead all keys have a specified color and can only be moved horizontally to change the active times and blending of each color.

=== Fog ===
The [[fog]] in Vibrant Visuals can be customized per biome in the same JSON file as regular fog in {{File|directory|fogs|inline=1}}, and using the {{Cmd|fog}} command.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/foginresourcepacks?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Fog in Resource Packs|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref> However, Vibrant Visuals has some options for more complex volumetric fog and Henyey-Greenstein G.<ref name=":4">{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/volumetricfoglightshaftscustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Volumetric Fog and Light Shafts|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref>

The density of volumetric fog can be adjusted, either for specified heights or every height, for each block where fog occurs in different situations (air, water, lava). For fog in the air, clouds, or water, the color of the fog can be specified. Finally, Vibrant Visuals allows to change light shafts inside fog for water and air. All fog settings are optional, if not specified they will equal to lower settings in the fog stack, first global values and then default values.

For all settings and the JSON format, see [[Fog definition]].

=== Color grading ===
Configurations for color grading and tone mapping can be adjusted for various situations and colors, making the final look of the scene fully customizable.<ref name="color-grading-tone-mapping" /> Both post-processing effects are configured in JSON file per biome in the {{File|directory|color_grading|inline=1}} directory.

Color grading is split into three scales based on lighting applied to the objects, and there is an additional temperature grading option. The highlight parameters are applied to the brightest pixels, the shadows to the darkest pixels, and midtones to pixels close to the average luminance of a scene. Highlights and shadows need to be enabled for specified color grading, otherwise the midtone parameters will be applied to all pixels as a global setting. The minimum brightness of the highlights and maximum brightness of the shadows affect which pixels are considered highlights and shadows instead of midtones.

For each color grading parameter, different values for each RGB color can be specified.

* The '''contrast''' affects the pixels with different luminances from the average luminance. Higher contrast values will increase brightness of highlights and darken shadows, while lower contrast values result in a more gray image with less differences in color and brightness.
* '''Gain''' affects the luminance intensity of the whole image, regardless of the luminance of a pixel.
* Similar to gain, the '''gamma''' affects the overall luminance intensity of all pixels, but after all other post-processing effects have been applied.
* The '''offset''' adjusts the intensity of pixels based on the average luminance of the scene, which is added to all pixels and has a stronger effect on brighter pixels than darker pixels.
* '''Saturation''' changes the intensity of colors apart from their luminance. Higher values increase the intensity, while lower values result in a grayscale image.

Finally, the temperature can be adjusted for the whole image, affecting how "warm" (yellow/orange) or "cool" (blue) the scene becomes. The type of temperature grading can be inverted, to make higher temperatures result in a warmer or cooler image.

The '''tone mapping''' effect cannot be customized for individual curves, but there are six operators that can be selected. Reinhard is a generic operator which looks good in low-contrast scenes and has a lower quality for higher luminances. Reinhard Luma is an extended variant that preserves details in low dynamic range regions, and Reinhard Luminance is a variant that preserves colors in higher luminance regions.

There are also filmic tone mapping operators, which emulate real-life film and work best when other Vibrant Visuals configurations are based on physically accurate values. Hable and ACES are filmic operators which preserve subtle differences in extremely dark or bright scenes, but come at a higher performance cost. Mojang Studios has developed a generic filmic tone mapping curve which preserves a bit more hue saturation at high luminance regions.

=== Cubemaps ===
Cubemaps are six 2D textures always rendered around the player which are affected by directional, ambient, and sky lighting, and scattering.<ref name=":0">{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/cubemapcustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Cubemaps|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref> They can be customized in {{File|directory|cubemaps|inline=1}} for each biome or set of biomes. Custom cubemaps only affect the [[Overworld]], the cubemap used in the [[End sky]] is unaffected.

The influence of each type of light on the cubemap can be customized, but it is always dependent of the biome's lighting settings and which types of lighting are currently applied. Cubemaps can be affected by two types of scattering. Depending on whether the cubemap contains objects in the sky (such as [[clouds]]), or in space (such as [[stars]]), atmospheric scattering should be turned on or off, respectively. Volumetric scattering lets fog and light shafts affect the cubemap, for objects close to the surface.

=== Shadows ===
[[File:Vibrant Visuals shadows comparison.png|thumb|A comparison of blocky (top) and soft shadows (bottom).]]
There are two settings for shadows created by blocks, entities, and some other objects.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/shadowscustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Shadows|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref> They can be changed with a JSON file in {{File|directory|shadows|inline=1}} and are applied globally.

* The '''shadow style''' affects which type of shadows are rendered. This can be soft, which is often used in third-party shaders and other video games, or blocky, which is used in default Vibrant Visuals. Both types are affected by the shape of the object casting the shadows.
* The '''texel size''' represents the resolution in texture to which shadows will be quantized. For the best effect, this should be the same as the pixel resolution used for block textures, which makes shadows align with the pixel grid.

=== Water ===
[[File:Vibrant Visuals particles comparison.png|thumb|Different particle concentrations create colored underwater fog. Clockwise from top-left: default water, medium CDOM, medium suspended sediment, and low chlorophyll values.]][[File:Vibrant Visuals waves.png|thumb|Animated water waves enabled with a resource pack. This pack uses the default settings for waves.]]
[[Water]] effects can be customized per biome or for default water in the {{File|directory|water|inline=1}} directory.<ref name=":5">{{Cite|url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/documents/vibrantvisuals/watercustomization?view=minecraft-bedrock-stable|title=Water Effects|website=Microsoft Learn}}</ref> Instead of blending the effects per biome based on the camera's location, the water color is set for the location of the water block in the world, meaning that multiple biome effects for water can be observed at once.

There are three elements that can be customized: particle concentrations, waves, and caustics.
* '''Particle concentrations''' affect the color and underwater light scattering. There are three particle concentrations in mg/L, which aren't used in default Vibrant Visuals:
** CDOM produces yellow to yellow-brown collors. Low values result in a fresh, blue appearance, like real-life oceans, and rivers have higher CDOM and more colored water.
** Chlorophyll produces green colors, which varies based on the temperature in real life.
** Suspended sediment produces red to red-brown colors, which appears more in real-life rivers.
* '''Waves''' are animations on the surface of water, disabled in default Vibrant Visuals. They can partially replace the water surface texture by actual three-dimensional textures, but this doesn't affect gameplay. Waves can be customized with various settings, which affect speed variations, smoother or sharper shapes, the amount of waves (and variations) per block, and the height of waves. Individual wave animations can blend into each other and pull into larger waves, which can be customized.
* '''Caustics''' are animated textures projected on any object surfaces ''behind'' a water surface when directional lighting hits the surface, which are enabled by default. The caustics use an internal texture with 64 frames of animation, but this can be changed to any custom texture. The speed of the animation (frame length) and scale can be customized, and the intensity can be increased.
** A custom caustics texture must have all animation frames laid out vertically next to each other, each using the same square resolution. It should be located under the {{File|directory|textures|inline=1}} directory in the [[resource pack]], declared in {{File|file|textures_list.json|inline=1}}.
*The [[biome]]'s '''water color''' is ignored by default in Vibrant Visuals, but {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}}, the contribution of the regular water color can be customized. Depending on the setting, water will be tinted with a color specified in the [[Resource pack#Biomes|client biome]] file, which is applied prior to the effects from particle concentrations.

== History ==

=== Announcement ===
Vibrant Visuals were revealed at [[Minecraft LIVE – March 2025]], planned for ''Bedrock Edition'' in the coming months, with more improvements over the next few years.<ref>{{YouTube link|jGNgh5zEFkY|Minecraft LIVE - March 2025|Minecraft|March 22, 2025|t=15m26s}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|NTOLOErWN4w|MINECRAFT’S VISUAL REFRESH!|Minecraft|June 14, 2025|t=228s}}</ref> It is planned to come to ''Java Edition'' in the future, but without colored lighting.<ref>{{cite|url=https://discord.com/channels/1362331987666403328/1362335022782087389/1362744378539511931|title=LowSkillCamper's FAQ on the Vibrant Vanguard Discord server|website=Discord.com|date=April 18, 2025|quote=<br>Q: Colored light?<br>
A: No.}}</ref> Developers are rewriting the rendering code before Vibrant Visuals will be added to all ''Java Edition'' supported devices.<ref name="java" />

=== Deferred Technical Preview ===
Before Vibrant Visuals was released, the deferred rendering engine was available behind the "Render Dragon Features for Creators" [[experiment]] in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]''. This was built on the features for [[ray tracing]], and gradually developed more exclusive rendering features.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/creator/article/new-render-dragon-features-creators|title=New Render Dragon Features for Creators|date=August 2, 2023|author=Kayla Kinnunen|website=[[Minecraft.net]]}}</ref> Unlike Vibrant Visuals, Mojang Studios did not provide any default configurations and textures, meaning that it needed to be configured first through [[resource pack]]s, similar to ray tracing.

Since the vanilla implementation of Vibrant Visuals, the experimental deferred lighting mode has been merged with the graphics upgrade. However, the experiment is still used for other deferred rendering features that are not implemented in Vibrant Visuals, such as colored lighting.
