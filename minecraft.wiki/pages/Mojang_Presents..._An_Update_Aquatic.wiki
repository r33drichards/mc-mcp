'''Mojang Presents... An Update Aquatic''' is an animated trailer, presenting a unique mix of ''Minecraft'' characters in realistic environments, promoting the [[Update Aquatic]]

== Summary ==
A parody of a nature documentaries, the video opens with curtains revealing the [[ocean]], as a narrator praises the sea as a "vast space... of nothing." Suddenly, the narrator's peace is disturbed by the emergence of [[Dolphin|dolphins]], conceding that it ''used'' to be empty. "An [[Update Aquatic]]" is announced, as the narrator whines about the dolphin's grace, before showing footage of [[Tropical Fish|tropical fish]] and [[Turtle|turtles]] on a beach. The narrator is audibly annoyed by their slowness, saying they don't have all day to get into the [[water]]. They then appear inside of a [[coral reef]], which the narrator calls majestic, before being shown a [[shipwreck]], which the narrator calls sad. However, a [[drowned]] appears, which the narrator cheerfully identifies as a survivor.

Moving onto [[Iceberg|icebergs]], the narrator appears to either change their mind on the tragedy of shipwrecks or make a very distasteful joke, saying that [[Iceberg (feature)|icebergs]] are "why all those stupid ships sank." They then change the topic to [[Bubble Column|bubble columns]], simply remarking "bubbles" before being startled by the appearance of a [[phantom]], which they remark "isn't very aquatic." As they're shown [[Ocean Ruins|ocean ruins]], they concede they "sound somewhat entertaining," and then see a barrage of new features, including coral reefs, [[cod]], [[kelp]], [[Turtle Egg|turtle eggs]], [[Trident|tridents]], [[Buried Treasure|buried treasure]], [[salmon]], [[seagrass]], [[Canyon|underwater ravines]], tropical fish, and finally [[pufferfish]]. Remarking "what a kook!" to the sight of a pufferfish, the narrator warms up to the prospect of updating the oceans. As the video ends, it is credited as starring "assorted fish," as well as "crafted by many DEVELOPERS, a few PIXEL ARTISTS & inspired by real-life OCEANS."
