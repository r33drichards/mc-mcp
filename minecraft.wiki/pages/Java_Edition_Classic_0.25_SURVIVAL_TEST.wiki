== Changes ==

'''General'''

** Mobs are now faster.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:19:42 <Real> holy smokes i just had some zombies come at me with incredible speed! intended, Notch?''", "''A11:19:58 <08Notch> yes. ;)''" (16:19 UTC)</ref>
** Mobs can now see the player from further away.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A10:47:07 <potato> notch what do you think about monsters being able to see you from farther away''" [...] "''A10:48:20 <08Notch> already done, potato ''" (15:47 to 15:48 UTC)</ref>
** Mobs now anger toward the player if attacked, regardless of the distance between the player and mob (evident when shooting [[arrow]]s).
* Mobs now respawn over time.
** Lone mobs lose health over time and eventually die.
* Hostile mobs can now fight each other.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A10:45:50 <08Notch> aaand I'm adding monster infighting''" [...] "''A10:46:06 <08Notch> if you make a skeleton hit any monster, that monster will hunt the skeleton''" (15:45 to 15:46 UTC)</ref>
** For example, if a skeleton shoots another hostile mob, that mob fights back that skeleton.
*** Skeletons do not fight other skeletons.

* Killing a skeleton now makes 4–9<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A11:38:06 <08Notch> they drop between 4 and 10 arrows''" [...] "''A11:38:30 <08Notch> oh, wait, no, between 4 and 9''" (16:38 UTC)</ref> arrows drop with random velocities around the skeleton's corpse.

(16:18 UTC)</ref>

== Trivia ==
*This version, same as [[Java Edition Indev 0.31 20091223-1457|Indev 0.31 20091223-1457]], was only available for 2 minutes, what makes them the shortest lived versions across all ''Minecraft'' editions.
