;[[API]]
*Added three classes: the {{cd|IBlockPaletteItem}} interface and the {{cd|ProbabilityBlockPaletteItem}} and {{cd|SimpleBlockPaletteItem}} concrete classes. 
** These classes will be used in the later implementation of the Block Palette.
*{{cd|ModalTool.bindPropertyPane}} API function will now only bind a single pane to the tool. 
** Bound pane will be displayed in the layout drawer next to the tool rail on tool activation. It is recommended to update the pane state once it’s associated with the tool to ensure it’s displayed correctly.
*Added {{cd|uniqueId}} property to {{cd|IMenuCreationParams}} API which will replace {{cd|IMenu}} id on creation.
*Added menubar: {{cd|IMenuContainer}} property to {{cd|IPlayerUISession}}. {{cd|IMenuContainer}} will manage menu related operations.
**Added {{cd|getMenu}} method to {{cd|IMenuContainer}} to return an existing menu item. Predefined editor menus can be retrieved with the new {{cd|CoreMenuType}} enum.
**Moved {{cd|createMenu}} from {{cd|IPlayerUISession}} to {{cd|IMenuContainer}}.
;Other
*Tool mode screen layout will now be using a fixed drawer system rather than floating window panels. 
** Drawers panels support drag to resize, expand/collapse, and show/hide behaviors.
*Changed top level menus to show up only when they contain items.
