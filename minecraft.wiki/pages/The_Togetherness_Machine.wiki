=== Summary ===
The video starts with a quick preview of the Togetherness Machine. Then, the creator of the machine is introduced by the narrator; [[Sparks]]. The narrator explains that the Togetherness Machine can either combine the [[Edition|many different versions of Minecraft]] into one ''Minecraft'', or destroy the known universe. Sparks turns on the Togetherness Machine, which activates an elaborate set of contraptions, which results in five stop-motion cranes going toward the main floating islands, which represent the different versions of ''Minecraft''. The [[Player|players]] on the different floating islands notice this and go toward them. The cranes take small pieces of the islands, which bring all of the players with. Now with the players connected, they are able to play together on different devices.

[MUSIC]

This is Sparks. 

Hey Sparks.

[MUSIC]

Sparks built a togetherness machine. 

This machine holds the power to fuse many Minecrafts into one 

Minecraft or destroy the known universe. 

Ready, Sparks?

[MUSIC]

Wow. And the universe didn't explode. So many Minecrafts are fused into one huge Minecraft. 

We can all play together on multiplayer servers with 

millions of consoles, PCs and mobiles. 

Minecraft really is better together

[MUSIC]
