The '''Christmas 2010 Cape''' and the '''New Year 2011 Cape''' were [[capes]] that were temporarily shown on all players during the 2010 holidays, which took place just after the introduction of capes in [[Java Edition Beta 1.0]].

== Distribution ==
The Christmas 2010 Cape was displayed on all players on December 25, 2010. The New Year 2011 Cape was displayed on all players on December 31, 2010. These capes were not added to accounts.

This type of event has not been repeated for future holidays.

== Trivia ==
* This may have been done in part to showcase capes to the public, as the employee-exclusive [[Classic Mojang Cape]] was the only cape to exist at the time.
