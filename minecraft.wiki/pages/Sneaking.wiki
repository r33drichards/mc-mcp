[[File:Sneaking Steve (wide).png|right|225px]]
'''Sneaking''' (or '''crouching''') is a gameplay feature which allows players to move stealthily, preventing them from falling off of [[block]]s, avoiding detection of [[mob]]s and the [[locator bar]], and making their [[hitbox]] smaller, allowing them to fit in smaller spaces.

== Controls ==
{{main|Controls}}
{{IN|java|bedrock}} with keyboard controls, the control for sneaking defaults to {{key|shift}}. The player sneaks as long as the key is held down. {{IN|bedrock}} with touch controls, sneaking is toggled by double-tapping [[File:Sneak button.png|30px]] and toggled back by double-tapping [[File:Sneak toggled button.png|30px]]. {{IN|bedrock}} with gamepad controls, sneaking is toggled by pressing on {{Xbutton|onethumb-right-click}}. Certain actions like opening the [[inventory]] can cancel sneaking, even if the player is still holding down the key for sneaking. This never happens on touch devices as the player doesn't need to hold down the sneak key.

== Effects ==
[[Image:Sneakoverthelava.png|right|thumb|223px|A player sneaking to avoid falling into [[lava]].]]
While sneaking, including being forced to sneak by entering a space less than 1.8 blocks tall but not less than 1.5 blocks:

*The player moves slower, at a speed of about 1.3 m/s.
**If two movement keys are pressed at once, the player sneaks diagonally at a faster 1.8 m/s.
*Eye level moves down {{frac|1|8}} of a block, and the character model bends over slightly. The latter can be seen in {{control|third-person view}}. Additionally, the third-person camera itself moves down.
*The player's hitbox height reduces from its usual 1.8 blocks to 1.5 blocks.

While sneaking by using the {{Control|sneak}} control:
*Players are prevented from walking off edges if the [[Solid block#Height|difference in height]] between the two surfaces is higher than 0.6 blocks as long as they are up to 0.6 blocks above the ground,{{only|Java}} which makes sneaking useful for building horizontally outward over empty space. 
**The player can still dismount blocks while sneaking by [[jumping]] over the block's edge.
**A sneaking player still falls if the block beneath the player's feet is destroyed.
*[[Hostile mobs]] do not become aware of the player until within 80% of the usual detection range.
*Players cannot hear their own footstep sounds.
*In multiplayer, a sneaking player's name tag appears fainter than normal, invisible to players more than 32 blocks away, and invisible through solid [[block]]s.
*If players are on a climbable block (such as [[ladder]] or [[vines]]) other than scaffolding, they do not move down. This gives the impression of holding on to that specific ladder rung or vine. Mining speed is still decreased by a factor of 5.
*Pressing {{control|use}} prioritizes using a held item over interacting with a targeted block. For example, this allows placing a [[hopper]] on a [[chest]], a [[torch]] on a [[furnace]], or [[redstone]] on a [[command block]].
*Players are able to interact with a tamed [[horse]] (tamed donkey or mule inventories, also) when pressing {{control|use item}} control while holding the {{control|sneak}} key.
*The player moves downward on [[scaffolding]].
**The player can't fall through a scaffolding block hanging in mid-air.
*The player moves downward in [[powder snow]] if they are wearing leather [[boots]]. 
**Without leather boots, the player simply sinks into powder snow without control.
*The player does not bounce on [[slime block]]s.
*[[Magma block]]s do not cause harm.
*Stepping on [[redstone ore]] does not light it.
*The player sinks faster in water or lava.
*[[Sculk sensor]]s and [[warden]]s do not detect vibrations from sneaking players, even if they jump while sneaking.
**Sculk sensors can still detect players that stand on top of them, even when they are sneaking.
**The warden can still "sniff out" a sneaking player's location and slowly approach them.
*The player's waypoint in the [[locator bar]] is not shown to other players.
*{{IN|java}}, if sneaking is set to "Toggle" under Accessibility Settings or Controls, the player keeps sneaking when interacting with blocks that have a UI if the player was sneaking when they interacted with the block.
*{{IN|bedrock}}, sneaking is used to block attacks while holding a [[shield]].
*{{IN|java}}, while holding a shield in the [[off-hand]], the player can strip or scrape blocks with an axe in the main-hand if they {{control|use}} while sneaking.
** If the player is not sneaking, they defend with a shield instead of stripping/scraping a block.

Sneaking does '''not''' affect:
*Jump height: players can still jump up to the same heights and at the same vertical speed. Horizontal jump speed and distance is decreased, however.
*[[Farmland]] and crops: they are still trampled when jumped upon.

== Sneaking speed ==
The sneaking speed attribute affects movement speed while sneaking. With the [[Swift Sneak]] enchantment, sneaking speed is increased by 15% per level of enchantment.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*While flying in [[Creative]] mode, holding the {{control|jump}} and sneak buttons simultaneously causes the player to remain at the same height.
*{{IN|bedrock}}, the player uses a sneaking stance when flying downward. The player can also place blocks on chests, furnaces and other utility blocks in this stance, suggesting the player ''is'' actually in a sneaking mode. {{IN|java}}, the player no longer enters sneak mode when flying downward, but they still don't interact with blocks by right-clicking.
*{{IN|bedrock}}, the player can bridge out by looking at the [[air]] block they are placing on, though it must be adjacent to an existing block. This works even if the player is not sneaking.<ref>{{ytl|Yc6xgkuCdRQ|t=4m5s}}</ref>
**{{IN|java}}, the player must travel to the edge of the block (usually by sneaking) and look backward to place the next block.
*If the player begins to sneak while [[sprinting]], they sneak faster than someone who sneaks without sprinting.<ref>{{bug|MC-152728}}</ref>
**This is more noticeable when the player is wearing pants or leggings with the Swift Sneak enchantment.
