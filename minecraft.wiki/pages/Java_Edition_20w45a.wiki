'''20w45a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.17]], released on November 4, 2020,<ref>{{snap|20w45a|November 4, 2020}}</ref> which adds the first [[Caves & Cliffs]] features.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Small Amethyst Bud (U) JE1.png; Medium Amethyst Bud (U) JE1.png; Large Amethyst Bud (U) JE1.png|32px}} [[Amethyst bud]]'''
* Grows from [[budding amethyst]], which is found in amethyst geodes.
* Starts out small, but grows into medium after a while, large after even more time and eventually becomes an [[amethyst cluster]].
* Unlike crops, each growth stage is a separate block instead of a block state.
* Drops nothing if broken in its premature stages, even with Silk Touch.

'''[[File:Amethyst Cluster (U) JE1.png|32px]] [[Amethyst cluster]]'''
* The final, mature stage of the amethyst bud, which grows from budding amethyst in amethyst geodes.
* Drops amethyst shards if broken, in an amount affected by Fortune, but can also be picked up with Silk Touch.
* Emits a light level of 5.

'''[[File:Block of Amethyst JE1.png|32px]] [[Block of amethyst]]'''
* A block found in amethyst geodes.
* Unlike the budding amethyst, the block of amethyst can be obtained when mined.
* Can also be crafted with 4 amethyst shards.

'''[[File:Budding Amethyst JE1.png|32px]] [[Budding amethyst]]'''
* Generates amethyst crystals on any of its sides (if next to a water source block or air, and if the side is not against another block), in a given time.
* Cannot be obtained when mined, even with Silk Touch, and does not drop anything.
* Breaks immediately if pushed by a [[piston]] or sticky piston.
** Cannot be pulled by sticky pistons.
* Generates in amethyst geodes.

'''[[File:Calcite JE1.png|32px]] [[Calcite]]'''
* An off-white stone that generates in geodes, between [[tuff]] and [[Block of Amethyst|amethyst]].

'''{{Animate|Candle JE1 BE1.png; White Candle.png; Light Gray Candle.png; Gray Candle.png; Black Candle.png; Brown Candle.png; Red Candle.png; Orange Candle.png; Yellow Candle.png; Lime Candle.png; Green Candle.png; Cyan Candle.png; Light Blue Candle.png; Blue Candle.png; Purple Candle.png; Magenta Candle.png; Pink Candle.png|32px}} [[Candle]]s'''
* Crafted with [[honeycomb]] and [[string]].
* Come with 16 dyed types and a yellowish non-dyed type. 
* Can be lit by any item that produces fire.
* Up to 4 can be placed in a single block, similar to [[sea pickle]]s, for a maximum light level of 12.
** Only candles of the same color can be placed on the same block.
* Only one can be placed on an uneaten cake and lit.
** If any of the cake is consumed the candle pops off.
* Can be placed, but cannot be lit, underwater.

'''{{Animate|Copper Block JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Copper block]]'''
* Can be crafted with 9 copper ingots, and can also be crafted back into 9 copper ingots.
* Oxidizes and changes texture to a turquoise-green over time.
* Can be stopped from oxidizing by combining it with a honeycomb to create a waxed copper block.
* Can be crafted into cut copper.

'''{{Animate|Copper Ore JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Copper ore]]'''
* Generates randomly underground in small blobs, but this has been confirmed to be a placeholder.
* Has the same rarity as iron.
* Generating starts at the same minimum level(s) as iron.
* Can be smelted into a copper ingot.

'''{{Animate|Cut Copper JE1.png|32px}} [[Cut copper]]'''
* Can be made into stair and slab variants.
* Oxidizes and changes texture over time.
* Can be stopped from oxidizing by combining it with a honeycomb to create waxed cut copper.

'''{{Animate|Cut Copper Slab JE1.png|32px}} [[Cut copper slab]]'''
* Oxidizes and changes texture over time.
* Can be stopped from oxidizing by combining it with a honeycomb to create a waxed cut copper slab.

'''{{Animate|Cut Copper Stairs (N) JE1.png|32px}} [[Cut copper stairs]]'''
* Oxidizes and changes texture over time.
* Can be stopped from oxidizing by combining it with a honeycomb to create waxed cut copper stairs.

'''[[File:Lightning Rod (U) JE1.png|32px]] [[Lightning rod]]'''
* Can be crafted with 3 copper ingots.
* Nearby lightning strikes within a 16 block radius get redirected to the lightning rod.
* Gives off a redstone signal with a strength of 15 if hit by lightning.
* Can be activated directly by throwing a trident with Channeling at it during a [[thunderstorm]], though this does not produce a redstone signal.

'''[[File:Tinted Glass JE1.png|32px]] [[Tinted glass]]'''
* A black variant of glass that does not let light pass through.
* Can be crafted with 4 amethyst shards and a glass block.
** Stained glass cannot be used to craft tinted glass.
* Drops itself if mined without [[Silk Touch]] or even by hand, unlike [[glass]].

'''[[File:Tuff.png|32px]] [[Tuff]]'''
* A grayish stone that composes the outer layer of amethyst geodes.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Amethyst Shard JE1.png|32px]] [[Amethyst shard]]'''
* Obtained from breaking amethyst clusters.
* The amount dropped can be increased with the [[Fortune]] enchantment.
* Can be used to craft tinted glass, blocks of amethyst and a spyglass.

'''[[File:Bundle JE1.png|width=32x32]] [[Bundle]]'''
* Crafted with 2 [[string]] and 6 [[rabbit hide]].
* Used to store other items (except [[shulker box]]es) inside of it.
* Is able to hold different types of items inside of it.
** Holds the equivalent of one single stack of items.
*** Items with smaller stacks, such as [[ender pearl]]s, take up more room in a bundle, and non-stackable items take up the whole bundle.
* The bundle's contents can be opened by pressing {{ctrl|use}} while holding it.

'''[[File:Copper Ingot JE1.png|32px]] [[Copper ingot]]'''
* Obtained by smelting copper ore.
* Used to craft copper blocks, lightning rods and spyglasses.

'''[[File:Spyglass JE1.png|32px]] [[Spyglass]]'''
* Crafted with 2 copper ingots and an amethyst shard.
* When used, it zooms in on wherever the player is looking, but limits their view to a small circle. [[File:Spyglass scope JE1.png|32px]]
** The overlay that limits the view can be removed with a [[resource pack]] or by pressing {{key|F1}}.
* There is a unique animation for using the spyglass, which is visible in third person perspective.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Amethyst Geode JE1.png|32px]] [[Amethyst geode]]s'''
* A new feature found uncommonly underground (can rarely appear exposed to the surface close to sea level).
* Contains blocks of amethyst and budding amethyst blocks, which are encased in a shell of calcite and tuff.
** Also generates with a small air pocket nearby which may open into the geode.
* Generally generates at or below sea level. (y = 63)
* Most commonly generates at lower levels. (y = 0 to y = 40)
* Overrides standard caves and canyons, but is overridden by mineshafts.
* Currently has a high generation rate, presumably for testing purposes which was also done with [[ruined portal]]s before.

=== General ===
'''Loot tables'''
* New functions: <code>set_banner_pattern</code>
** Sets tags needed for banner patterns. Parameters:
*** <code>patterns</code> – list of pattern objects:
**** <code>pattern</code> – name of pattern (<code>square_bottom_left</code>, <code>bricks</code>, etc.)
**** <code>color</code> – name of color (<code>light_gray</code>, etc.)
*** <code>append</code> – if <code>true</code>, new elements are appended to existing ones instead of replacing.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>candle_cakes</code> block tag.
** Contains all 17 types of candle cake.
** If the player puts a candle on a cake, and keeps clicking the candle on the cake, the candle is duplicated.
** Blocks in this tag are considered candle cakes and can be lit, if they have the <code>lit</code> block states set to false.
* Added the <code>candles</code> block and item tags.
** Contains all 17 types of candles.
** Blocks in this tag are considered candles and can be lit, if they have the <code>lit</code> and <code>waterlogged</code> block states and both are false.
** Cakes use this tag to determine if a candle item can be placed on it or not.
* Added the <code>cauldrons</code> block tag.
** Contains cauldrons, water cauldrons, and lava cauldrons.
** This tag is used in certain pathfinding processes.
* Added the <code>crystal_sound_blocks</code> block tag.
** Contains amethyst blocks and budding amethyst.
** Blocks in this tag play the "amethyst block chime" sound repeatedly for a short amount of time after being stepped on, gradually decreasing in volume.
* Added the <code>ignored_by_piglin_babies</code> item tag.
** Contains leather.
** Baby piglins do not attempt to pick up items in this tag. Adult piglins are unaffected. Baby piglins still follow the other rules adult piglins follow.
*** If an item is in this tag while simultaneously being recognized as a wanted item by piglins, this tag takes precedence.
* Added the <code>piglin_food</code> item tag.
** Contains raw and cooked porkchop.
** Piglins can eat items in this tag.
*** Eating refers to the piglin seeking out and picking up an item without appearing in its inventory, thus vanishing.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cauldron]]s'''
* Can now be filled with lava.
** Lava filled cauldrons can damage players and mobs inside of it.
** Lava filled cauldrons give off a [[redstone comparator]] signal of strength 1.
* Have been split into normal, water and lava cauldrons.

'''[[Grass path]]'''
* Renamed to "Dirt Path", as per {{BE}}.
** The block ID has also been changed to <code>dirt_path</code>.
* Can now be made with dirt, coarse dirt, mycelium, and podzol.

'''[[Piston]]s'''
* Particles now appear if a block is broken by a piston.
** Sounds, however, do not.<ref>{{bug|MC-203550}}</ref>

'''All [[rail]]s'''
* Are now able to be waterlogged.
* No longer break when contacted by water.

'''[[Water]] '''
* Flowing water no longer breaks rails.

'''[[Shulker box]]es'''
* Now mimics the opening and closing of a [[shulker]].
** Unlike its mob counterpart, it does not elevate the [[player]] when they are standing on it.

'''[[Cake]]s'''
* Have a variation called "Candle Cake".
** Can be created by using a candle on an uneaten cake.
** The candle on the cake comes with 17 colors, depending on the color of the candle used to create it.
** Pop out the original candle when any of the cake is eaten.

=== Items ===
'''[[Firework rocket]]s'''
* Simple firework rockets with one gunpowder can now be crafted using the recipe book.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Shulker]]s'''
* If a shulker is hit by another shulker's projectile, it now has a chance of spawning a new shulker.
** Shulkers are more likely to spawn new shulkers when there are fewer other shulkers nearby.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Experience orb]]s'''
* Now sometimes merge when in large quantities, to improve performance.
** Merging does not affect the amount of experience gathered from collecting the merged orbs.
* No longer follow dead players.

'''[[Minecart]]s'''
* Can now move in water, but move considerably slower than they do on land.

=== General ===
'''[[Data Pack|Data]] and [[resource pack]]s'''
* Changed the resource pack version number from 6 to 7, as the following have been changed:
** [[Drowned]] texture mirroring has changed.<ref>{{bug|MC-174685}}</ref>
** Slots for the game mode selector are now 26 pixels instead of 25.
* Split the <code>pack_version</code> number into separate resource and data pack versions; the data pack version remains at 6.

'''Dedicated [[server]]s'''
* A dedicated server can enforce custom resource packs by setting <code>require-resource-pack</code> in <code>server.properties</code>. When this option is used, players are prompted for a response and are disconnected if they decline the required pack.

'''Entity storage'''
* Entities have been extracted from main (terrain) chunks and are now stored in separate <code>entities</code> directory (similar to POI storage). Those new files are still region files with NBT.

'''Libraries'''
* The game now uses javabridge 1.1.23 instead of 1.0.22.
