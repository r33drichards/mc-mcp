A '''rabbit''' is a [[passive mob]] found in many snowy and forested [[biome]]s, as well as [[desert]]s. It runs away from [[player]]s that are not holding its [[food]], and is able to jump over [[fence]]s. Rabbits are a source of [[raw rabbit]], [[rabbit hide]] and [[rabbit's feet]].

'''The Killer Bunny''' is a [[hostile]] rabbit variant that only exists {{in|je}} and can only be spawned using [[command]]s.

== Spawning ==
Rabbits spawn above [[grass]], [[snow block]]s or [[sand]] in specific biomes. They spawn in small groups
of 1 adult and 1–2 babies.{{more info|What about herds of 2-6 rabits in meadows and cherry groves?}}

They can generate individually after the generation of the world.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Variants ===
Rabbits can naturally spawn as one of 6 variants: brown, white, black, white splotched, gold, and salt.

Rabbits of the following colors spawn in the following biomes:
* {{EntitySprite|Desert Rabbit}} Gold:
** {{BiomeLink|Desert}}
* {{EntitySprite|White Rabbit}} White, {{EntitySprite|White Splotched Rabbit}} White Splotched:
** {{BiomeLink|Snowy Plains}}
** {{BiomeLink|Ice Spikes}}
** {{BiomeLink|Snowy Taiga}}
** {{BiomeLink|Grove}}
** {{BiomeLink|Snowy Slopes}}
** {{BiomeLink|Frozen Ocean}}{{only|Be|short=1}}
** {{BiomeLink|Frozen River}}{{only|Be|short=1}}
** {{BiomeLink|Snowy Beach}}{{only|Be|short=1}}
* {{EntitySprite|Black Rabbit}} Black, {{EntitySprite|Brown Rabbit}} Brown, {{EntitySprite|Salt Rabbit}} Salt:
** {{BiomeLink|Flower Forest}}
** {{BiomeLink|Taiga}}
** {{BiomeLink|Meadow}}
** {{BiomeLink|Old Growth Pine Taiga}}{{only|je|short=1}}
** {{BiomeLink|Old Growth Spruce Taiga}}{{only|je|short=1}}
** {{BiomeLink|Cherry Grove}}

Gold rabbits are the most common rabbit color and are found only in deserts. White and white splotched rabbits are also quite common and spawn in some snowy biomes. Default rabbit colors such as black, brown and salt can also spawn in any other non-snowy biome via [[spawn egg]]s, [[commands]], [[monster spawner]]s or breeding.

{{IN|JE}}, rabbits can also be found in [[old growth taiga]]s.

{{IN|BE}}, up to three baby rabbits spawn in flower forests and rabbits can also spawn in frozen aquatic biomes: [[snowy beach]]es, [[frozen ocean]]s, and [[frozen river]]s.

The [[wolves]] and [[fox]]es found in taigas and mountainous biomes may kill rabbits, so rabbits are generally more plentiful in the desert, flowery, or icy biomes.

[[#The Killer Bunny|The killer bunny]]{{only|je}} does not spawn naturally and must instead be spawned using the command {{cmd|summon minecraft:rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} }}.

* {{xp|1|3}} upon player kills.

Killing a baby rabbit yields no items or experience.

== Behavior ==
Rabbits hop around aimlessly instead of walking. They can jump up to almost 2 blocks in height. They slowly approach [[player]]s holding [[carrot]]s, [[golden carrot]]s or [[dandelion]]s within 8 [[block]]s. They do not follow players holding a [[carrot on a stick]].<ref>{{bug|MC-207993}}</ref> Rabbits also jump off of cliffs to reach carrots but do not go into [[lava]] for them. They randomly flee around if attacked. 

All non-hostile rabbits avoid players within 8 blocks and [[wolves]] within 10 blocks. They also avoid most [[monster]]s within 4 blocks except [[ghast]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, [[hoglin]]s, [[magma cube]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, [[phantom]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, [[shulker]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, [[slime]]s{{only|je|short=1}}, undead mounts ([[camel husk]]s, [[skeleton horse]]s, [[zombie horse]]s and [[zombie nautilus]]es), and the [[ender dragon]].<ref>{{bug|MC-304535||Rabbits are not scared of certain monsters}}</ref> Notably, rabbits do not try to avoid foxes and cats, and only run from them when attacked.

If {{cmd|gamerule mobGriefing}} is <code>true</code> and {{nbt|int|MoreCarrotTicks}} is less than or equal to 0, rabbits have a chance to find and eat mature [[carrot|carrot crop]]s{{only|je}} / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1{{only|be}}. This reduces the growth stage by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.

Wild [[wolves]], [[foxes]], and stray [[cats]] are hostile to rabbits.

=== Breeding ===
Rabbits can be [[Breeding|bred]] using [[carrot]]s, [[golden carrot]]s or [[dandelion]]s.

Baby rabbits usually inherit the same type of fur as one of the parents (47.5% chance of each), but there is a 5% chance for the baby to have the fur type matching the current [[biome]]. Baby rabbits grow to adulthood after 20 minutes, although their growth can be slowly accelerated using carrots, golden carrots or dandelions; each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.

Despite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.

A {{Section link|Toast}} rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.

{{IN|bedrock}} and {{el|education}}, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent {{in|java}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-158608|||WAI}}</ref>

== Variations ==
[[File:Six Rabbit Types.png|thumb|left|The six natural types of rabbits. The gold rabbit is looking at the player.]]

Rabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins. Skins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (white), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold fur, and salt and pepper fur. The [[biome]] determines the skin used:

* Rabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.
* Rabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.
* Rabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt fur, and 10% black fur.
* Rabbits with specific skins can be spawned using {{cmd|summon minecraft:rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}{{only|je}} or {{cmd|summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)}}{{only|be}}.
* While it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to <code>RabbitType: 0</code>, except for <code>RabbitType: 99</code>, the Killer Bunny.

There are two special variants of rabbits:
{{-}}

=== The Killer Bunny ===
{{Exclusive|java|section=1}}
<!-- "The Killer Bunny" redirects here. -->
[[File:Killer Bunny.png|thumb|right|upright|The current killer bunny texture]]
'''The killer bunny''' is an unused hostile variant of the rabbit exclusive to {{el|je}} that is hostile toward [[player]]s and [[wolves]]. It has pale pinkish white fur{{upcoming|JE 26.1}} and horizontal red eyes, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes. It can be spawned only by using the {{cmd|summon minecraft:rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} command. It appears with a nameplate over its head reading "The Killer Bunny".

If the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a [[spider]]. Once it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing {{hp|8}} [[damage]] on Normal difficulty. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player.

If it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any [[wolves]], including tamed wolves.

On Peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.

The killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding [[carrot]]s, despite its hostile nature.

=== Toast ===
{{hatnote|"Toast" redirects here. For messages displayed on-screen, see [[Toasts]], [[Advancement]]s, [[Recipe]], or [[Tutorial hints]].}}

[[File:Toast Rabbit.png|thumb|left|upright|The rabbit named "Toast" using a [[name tag]]]]

Naming a rabbit '''Toast''' (using either a [[name tag]] or a renamed [[spawn egg]]) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural white splotched rabbit. Other than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like a normal rabbit. When Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming. If the [[player]] renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves. Like the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.

This rabbit is based on user xyzen420's girlfriend's [http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/27hjog/to_themogminer_my_bunny_is_missing_please_help_me/ missing rabbit], which [[Ryan Holtz|Ryan Holtz (TheMogMiner)]] implemented as a memorial.<ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|483935152133775360|@xyZenTV The skin only appears when you name the rabbit Toast using a name tag, it isn't in the random pool:|Jul 1, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Warden concept art.jpg|thumb|The warden concept art mentioning the idea of a friendly relationship between wardens and rabbits.]]

* The Killer Bunny is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Rabbit of Caerbannog|Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog]] from the British comedy film ''[[Wikipedia:Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. 
** Internally, the texture file for the Killer Bunny is called {{code|caerbannog.png}}.
* The Killer Bunny was suggested by Twitter user @88bully.<ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|475038423011835904|@88bully @xyZenTV You, I like you. I like the way you think. However, no promises. Promises are made to be broken.|Jun 6, 2014}}</ref>
* The death sound for the rabbit is called {{code|bunnymurder.ogg}}.
* A [[concept art]] suggests that a friendly relationship between [[warden]]s and rabbits was considered during the warden's development.
