A '''block of coal''', also known as '''coal block''', is a block added in the 2013 joke update [[Java Edition 2.0]], it was later added as an authentic block in [[Java Edition 1.6.1|1.6]].

|B1 = Coal

|A3 = Coal
|B3 = Coal
|C3 = Coal
|Output = [Block of Coal]Block of Coal (Joke)
|Olink = Block of Coal (Joke)

}}

== Usage ==
Blocks of coal can be crafted back into coal but the coal won't be stackable with normal coal.<ref>The coal does not stack with other coal due to having a data value of 32767.</ref>

=== Crafting ingredient ===

|Output = Coal
|ingredients = '''Block of Coal'''
|name = Coal
|ignoreusage = 1
}}

=== Fuel ===
Blocks of coal can be used as fuel in a [[furnace]]. One block of coal lasts 800 seconds (16000 ticks){{verify}}, which smelts 80 items.
