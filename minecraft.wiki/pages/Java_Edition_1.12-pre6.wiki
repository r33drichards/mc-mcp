'''1.12-pre6''' is the sixth pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.12]], released on May 29, 2017,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-112-pre-release-6|Minecraft 1.12 Pre-Release 6}}</ref> which adds the ability to see credits from the menu screen.

== Additions ==
'''[[Title screen]]'''
* Added the ability to see credits by clicking the copyright text.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Command block]]s'''
* Tab-completing command names in command blocks will no longer add a <code>/</code> prefix.

'''[[Banner]]s'''
* "Chief fess" and "base fess" banners are now just "chief" and "base" banners.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Minecarts with TNT]]'''
* No longer instantly explode when hit with [[fire charge]]s; instead, they explode as if primed by an activator rail.

=== General ===
'''[[Function (Java Edition)|Function]]s'''
* Skipped functions (when the conditional fails) is now considered a failure (for example in command blocks).

'''[[Language]]'''
* Many pieces of text are now translatable, where previously they were hardcoded English.
** The full list of changes can be found [https://gist.github.com/Dinnerbone/3700d226481934f1eeffe5cd0c22b7d2 here].

'''Optimizations'''
* Optimized [[recipe book]] and [[Creative inventory]] searching, especially when using [[mod]]s.
** Namespaces (e.g ''minecraft'':stone) are no longer considered for searching.
* Optimized chunk loading, as the previous pre-release slowed it down.
