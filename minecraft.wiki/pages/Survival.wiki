[[File:Survival 1.21.5.png|thumb|Survival mode in ''Minecraft''. The [[health]] and [[hunger]] bars, as well as the [[Heads-up display#Hotbar|hotbar]], are visible in this picture.]]
'''Survival mode''' is one of the [[game mode]]s in ''[[Minecraft]]''. Players must collect resources, build structures, battle [[mob]]s, eat, and explore the world in an effort to survive.

{{IN|Java}}, [[advancement]]s are available on any world type regardless of whether cheats are turned on or off.

{{IN|bedrock}}, [[player]]s may receive [[achievement]]s in a world not set to Flat while playing Survival mode with cheats off and no [[add-on]]s applied. If a player creates a world in [[Creative]] mode and then loads it in Survival mode, the player cannot earn achievements in that world.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Crafting Table.png|thumb|right|upright|A crafting table, required to craft most items.]]

In Survival, [[player]]s have an [[inventory]] that consists of four rows of slots used to store [[item]]s, nine of which are found on the [[hotbar]]. All [[block]]s require a certain amount of time to break, unlike [[Creative]] mode where blocks can be instantly destroyed. {{IN|be|edu}}, if the command {{cmd|immutableworld true}} is executed, the player can't place or break [[block]]s like [[Adventure]] mode.

Items can be used in [[recipe]]s to create [[tool]]s and other items. This process is known as [[crafting]]. The recipes can also be accessed by clicking the [[recipe book]] under the 2×2 crafting grid. Most crafting recipes require a [[crafting table]]. Some items cannot be obtained by crafting normally and require a [[furnace]] for [[smelting|processing]] (e.g. glass requires sand for smelting). Various other crafting stations exist for other uses, such as [[brewing]], [[anvil|repairing]], and [[enchanting]].

[[File:Inventory.png|thumb|left|The basic Survival mode inventory {{in|java}}.]]

In Survival mode, the player is able to receive [[damage]] from the environment (fall damage, suffocation, [[lava]], and freezing) and from [[hostile mob]]s (unless playing on [[Peaceful]], where hostile mobs are disabled). A player who receives enough damage [[die]]s and returns to the world spawn, or to a previously slept-in bed, or in [[the Nether]] to a [[respawn anchor]] if the player set one.

If [[cheats]] are enabled, a player can switch to Survival mode by using the [[command]] {{cmd|gamemode survival}} but cannot earn [[achievement]]s.

=== Goals ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Beginner's guide}}

[[File:Big Cave Entrance.png|thumb|right|In caves like this, players can find many resources needed to advance in Survival mode.]]

In Survival, the main goal is to survive, build, explore, and have fun, but another optional goal in Survival is to defeat the [[ender dragon]].

The player can "beat the game" in Survival mode by defeating the [[ender dragon]] in [[the End]], but this does not terminate play; it provides a trophy item (a [[dragon egg]]), a large amount of [[experience]], triggers the "[[End Poem]]" and unlocks a gateway to allow easier access to the outer end islands; another common goal is to fulfill all the predefined [[achievement]]s{{only|be}}/[[advancement]]s{{only|je}}. Oceans also invite exploration, as they have corals, monuments, and adapted creatures like [[guardian]]s, [[fish]] and [[drowned]]. The player can also optionally fight the [[wither]] boss in order to obtain a [[nether star]] so that they can craft a [[beacon]], which also completes all of the in-game [[achievement]]s. A player can search for an [[elytra]] and more after finding an [[end city]] in the End.

=== {{anchor|SSP}} Survival single-player (SSP) ===
Survival single-player is the default game mode of ''Minecraft''. Single-player may be played online or offline, as long as the player has played the game at least once in order to allow the [[.minecraft|game files]] to be downloaded to their device.

[[File:Players building.png|thumb|right|Two players working together to build a shelter in Survival multiplayer.]]

Survival multiplayer allows players to connect to a central ''Minecraft'' [[server]]. This enables them to interact with each other and work together (or [[PvP|against each other]]) in order to achieve their goals. This is mostly used for friends to play on a private server together.

=== ''Java Edition'' ===
{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine|java classic}}
|{{HistoryLine||0.24 SURVIVAL TEST|Added Survival mode in [[Survival Test]]. During this time, death was permanent, meaning players could not respawn and the level needed to be restarted unless a save file had been created.
|A score system was implemented, where players gain more points the more [[mob]]s they kill. The player's score can only be seen when they die. Other mobs give more or less points than others: [[pig]]s give 10 points, [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s give 100 points, and [[creeper]]s give 250 points.
|Until mid-Alpha, Survival single-player was the only available mode besides [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]] Creative mode.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java infdev}}
|{{HistoryLine||20100327|Death is no longer permanent; the player is now able to [[respawn]].}}
|{{HistoryLine|java alpha}}
|{{HistoryLine||v1.0.15|Added multiplayer. Originally, Notch allowed only a limited number of people from the Minecraft IRC channel to participate in the first tests of multiplayer. These invitees could invite other people to test out this mode; however, the password was leaked and the server was quickly filled up. Notch released the first version of the multiplayer server software on August 4, 2010. The client was updated so that players could enter the IP of a server to join it.}}
|{{HistoryLine|java}}
|{{HistoryLine||1.3.1|Singleplayer was abolished in a technical sense. Instead, the player hosts a server that they can either close or open to others at any time. This change was intended to reduce the labor required to fix bugs for two different parts of ''Minecraft'', at a slight performance cost.}}
