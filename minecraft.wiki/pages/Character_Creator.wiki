[[File:Character Creator.png|thumb|right|290px|The Character Creator menu {{in|BE}}.]]
The '''Character Creator''' or '''dressing room''' is a feature {{in|BE}} that lets [[player]]s customize their [[skin]]s with interchangeable cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the dressing room button on the [[main menu]]. It can also be used to equip [[cape]]s. While some items are free, most of them cost [[Minecoin]]s, which are available through the [[Marketplace]]. Some of these items can be unlocked or earned by either completing in-game achievements, specific promotions, or limited-time events.

The Character Creator contained items the player was able to unlock {{in|MCE}}. All items unlocked in ''Minecraft Earth'' are no longer obtainable as of the game's discontinuation on June 30, 2021. These items remain available to use to those who unlocked them in ''Bedrock Edition''. 

== Description ==
The Character Creator menu is the second-topmost option that appears in the left sidebar that appears after entering the Dressing Room button. The left side of the panel shows Featured Items and Marketplace Pass items, along with two lists of a character’s customizable parts: ''Body'' and ''Style''. Either of these two lists can be expanded to show menus for specific parts of the character’s body. The menu for each part shows all items that the player owns, as well as some parts available in the Marketplace.

The right panel always shows a preview of the character. The button to the bottom right of the character allows the player to view the character from various angles. Below the character, there is a section showing the name of whichever item is being selected in the left panel, as well as its price if the item is not owned by the player.

==== Rarity ====
Each item in the Character Creator assigns them into one of the five rarity tiers: ''Common'', ''Uncommon'', ''Rare'', ''Epic'' and ''Legendary''. Each one is indicated by its color icon, which symbolizes their availability, pricing, and their perceived value. They typically don't impact the player's gameplay. Certain items are not inherently difficult to get, but rather, they are more challenging, expensive or harder to obtain.

For example: Items in ''Common'' and ''Uncommon'' are readily available, often with little or no special event requirement to obtain them. Items in ''Rare'' and ''Epic'', require participation in limited-time events to be claimed. ''Legendary'', the highest tier, is reserved for very special items like capes, which are tied to specific events and cannot be purchased.

== Trivia ==
* The Gray-Green-Blue-Purple-Gold rarity color hierarchy used by character creator items is a popular color coding scheme for item rarity in video games, first used in {{w|World of Warcraft}} and subsequently appearing in numerous other games.
