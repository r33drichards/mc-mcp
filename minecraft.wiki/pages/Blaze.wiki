{{relevant tutorial|Blaze farming}}
A '''blaze''' is a [[hostile mob]] found in [[Nether fortress]]es, and the only source of [[blaze rod]]s. A blaze attacks by floating upward and shooting [[Small Fireball|fireballs]] at its target in volleys of three at a time. It can also attack its target in melee range with its spinning rods.

== Spawning ==
Blazes may spawn naturally in [[Nether fortress]]es in groups of 2 or 3{{Only|Java|short=JE}} and from 1 to 3{{Only|Bedrock|short=BE}} at a [[light level]] of 11 or less. 

Blazes may also spawn from [[monster spawner]]s in Nether fortresses. Two spawners generate in every Nether fortress, and are located on small platforms surrounded by nether brick fences with a three-block staircase leading up to it. 

Spawning conditions for blazes: 
* In the structure bounding box of any single piece of the [[Nether fortress]] they can spawn on any block
* In the larger area bounding box of the entire [[Nether fortress]] they can spawn exclusively on [[Nether bricks]]

<!-- Do not add glowstone dust as it is in violation of MCW:UPTODATE due to the Legacy Console Edition being discontinued. Any edit that adds glowstone dust to this section will be immediately reverted. -->

== Behavior ==
Blazes can fly and are immune to damage from fire and lava. When not attacking, they stay on the ground or slowly sink through the air. When idle, blazes attempt to swim upward in [[lava]] or [[water]] {{in|bedrock}} but sink {{in|java}}. Despite taking damage from water, blazes make no attempt to protect themselves if pushed or dropped into water. Their pathfinding does not avoid [[fire]] or lava but does avoid water.

Blazes take {{hp|5}} freezing damage from [[powder snow]].

Blazes take {{hp|3}} damage when hit by a [[snowball]] and {{hp|1}} damage when hit by a [[splash water bottle]].

Like [[endermen]], blazes are damaged by [[rain]] by {{hp|1}} every half second.

The entire blaze texture appears brighter {{in|bedrock}}, similar to the [[drowned]]'s eyes. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], blazes and their fire are actually emissive and glowing, with the side-effect that the environment around a blaze darkens when looking at it.

=== Attacking ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Combat#Blaze}}
Blazes target players within 48 blocks. If a blaze is damaged by a player or another mob, it alerts other blazes within 48 blocks to target the attacker. A blaze flies when it acquires a target, slowly approaching while attempting to remain from 0.5 to 3.5 blocks above the target.
[[File:Blaze Shooting.gif|thumb|150px|left|A blaze attacking]]
A blaze's normal attack is a trio of [[small fireball]]s, shot from up to 48 blocks. Unlike with the [[ghast]] or [[breeze]], a blaze's projectiles ''cannot'' be deflected, but can be [[blocking|blocked]] with a [[shield]]. A blaze shoots only when it has a clear line of sight to its target. If line of sight is broken in the middle of its volley, the blaze suspends the remainder of its volley until line of sight returns. When using this attack, the blaze burns with fire for 3 seconds, shoots 3 small fireballs over the course of 0.9 seconds, then extinguishes its flames and waits for 5 seconds before attacking again. A blaze shoots its small fireballs with roughly the same lack of accuracy as a [[dispenser]]; however, the blaze's shots maintain the same speed all the way to the target, unlike the dispenser's, which start slow and accelerate. If a neutral or hostile mob is accidentally hit by a fireball, the mob will retaliate against the blaze.

A blaze that touches its target performs a melee attack once per second that does {{hp|4}} damage on Easy [[difficulty]], {{hp|6}} on Normal, and {{hp|9}} on Hard. This attack is not considered fire damage and does not ignite the target, and as such cannot be prevented by the [[Fire Resistance]] status effect.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* When throwing a [[potion]] of [[Invisibility]] on a blaze, the smoke remains visible.
* According to [[Jens Bergensten]], blazes look the way they do because all mobs in ''Minecraft'' are cuboid-shape, so to make them flame-like and magical, he created them as a core surrounded by rotating rods.<ref>{{Mcnet|meet-blaze|Meet the Blaze|December 20, 2016|Marsh Davies}}</ref>
* Blazes originally didn't have eyes when Jens Bergensten was first creating them and "just looked like a yellow rock". Eyes were added to "give it more personality".<ref>{{YouTube link|v3TXUTLClb0|Ask Mojang Midsummer Special with Jeb|Minecraft|June 18, 2020}}</ref>
* Despite not having visible feet, blazes are still capable of making footstep sounds.<ref>{{Cite bug|MC|92623|Certain mobs play footstep sounds and subtitles when they shouldn't|date=November 13, 2015}}</ref>
* According to Minecraft's "Visit the Nether!" blazes are sentient beings made of pure lava. The article theorizes they were created by the original inhabitants of Nether fortresses to serve as guards, but their creators lost control over the blazes and were subsequently destroyed by them.<ref>{{Mcnet|visit-nether-|Visit the Nether!|November 10, 2019|Duncan Geere}}</ref>
* On the official T-shirt "Alchemy" by JINX, the blaze is in the form of the {{Wikipedia|Vitruvian Man}} and the text uses the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]]. The words on the outside of the ring translate to: "nigredo", "albedo", "citrinitas", and "rubedo",{{Note|There is a nether track titled [[Rubedo]].}} which are all relating to {{Wikipedia|Magnum opus (alchemy)|magnum opus}}. The words on the ring translate to (starting from the top): "B * Crowmer", "poison * speed", "strenth * resist" {{sic}}, "vision * heal", and "regeneration" relating to [[potions]] and probably the artist's name. On the connecting lines the words translate to: "potln of thickness" {{sic}}, "potln of awkward" {{sic}}, "weakness potion" and "mundane potion" relating to [[Potion#Base potions|base potions]].
* As part of an official collaboration, blazes are included as monsters in a free add-on for the roleplaying game {{wikipedia|Dungeons & Dragons|''Dungeons & Dragons''}}.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.dndbeyond.com/claim/source/minecraft-creatures-monstrous-compendium|title=Minecraft x D&D|website=D&D Beyond}}</ref> In the game, they are "Elementals" and have the alignment "Typically Neutral Evil".
