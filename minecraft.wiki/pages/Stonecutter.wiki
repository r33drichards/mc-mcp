A '''stonecutter''' is a [[block]] used to easily [[craft]] many [[Stone (disambiguation)|stone]] and [[copper]] blocks, and is cheaper than normal crafting for [[stairs]] and copper variants. It is also a [[job site block]] for [[mason]] [[villager]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A stonecutter can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Stonecutter|pickaxe|wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
Stonecutters can generate inside mason houses in [[village]]s.

== Usage ==
=== Cutting ===
[[File:Stonecutter GUI Stone.png|thumb|right|Interface for the stonecutter {{in|java}}, cutting a stone into two stone slabs.]]

The stonecutter can be used as an alternative to the [[crafting table]] to craft most [[stone]]-related [[block]]s. All of its recipes require just one ingredient and produce one product (in varying quantities). It allows skipping steps to craft certain blocks; for example, a stone block can be directly turned into [[chiseled stone bricks]], something that requires multiple steps when [[crafting]]. It can also be used to cut [[brick]] related [[block]]s, such as [[resin bricks]].

Stonecutting is also more efficient than crafting for certain recipes. Crafting [[stairs]] is more efficient with a stonecutter than a crafting table, as 6 full blocks are crafted into 4 stairs, while stonecutter yields 1 stair per full block. The recipe for [[cut copper]] is even more efficient: with stonecutting, 1 block of copper turns into 4 blocks of cut copper, allowing the amount of copper blocks to be quadrupled.

The GUI contains a block selection menu that is empty. The menu is populated with blocks that can be crafted from that particular material, only if a block is inserted into its input.

=== Profession ===
{{main|Job site block}}
If a stonecutter has not been claimed by a [[villager]], any nearby unemployed villager has a chance to change their profession to a mason and claim the stonecutter as their [[job site block]].

=== Note blocks ===
Stonecutters can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.

== Trivia ==
* Even though the iron blade appears to be spinning rapidly, it deals no damage and has no hitbox.
* The stonecutter was most likely based on the [[stonecutter (old)|old stonecutter]] from ''[[Bedrock Edition]]'', as it has similar functionality.
