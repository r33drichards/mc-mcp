'''Beehives''' are [[craft]]able [[block]]s that house [[bee]]s, which fill their homes with honey made from gathered [[flower]] nectar. Full beehives can be harvested for [[honeycomb]]s (using [[shears]]) or [[honey bottle]]s (using [[glass bottle]]s). Bees will attack [[player]]s who harvest or break their homes without utilizing [[campfire]]s or [[Silk Touch]], respectively.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Tutorial: Honey farming#Avoiding Bee Anger}}
Beehives can be broken by any [[tool]] or by the [[player]]'s fist, though they break faster with an [[axe]]. When mined, they always drop themselves.

If a beehive is broken with a tool not enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], any bees inside emerge, and together with nearby bees, become angry at the player. If a Silk Touch tool is used, any bees inside remain inside and any other bees nearby do not become angry. 

If broken in [[Creative]] mode with bees inside, the beehive drops itself and bees inside remain inside.
