'''14w05a''' is the eighth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on January 30, 2014,<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|428917938390056960|Minecraft snapshot 14w05a is out!|January 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131052739/https://mojang.com/2014/01/minecraft-snapshot-14w05a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w05a|date=Janaury 30, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> which adds [[Spectator]] mode and [[barrier]] blocks.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Barrier (held) JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Barrier]]s'''
* Act like a solid [[block]] but are completely transparent.
** Can transfer redstone signals and allow blocks to be placed on it.
* Indestructible like [[bedrock]].
* Can only be obtained using {{cmd|give @s minecraft:barrier}}.
* Use the lava texture as its breaking particle.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Spectator]]'''
* New game mode.
* Usage: {{cmd|gamemode spectator}}, {{cmd|gamemode sp}} or {{cmd|gamemode 3}}.
* No interaction with the world.
** Player can move through any entity or block without interfering with it (commonly referred to as 'noclip' or as if in the [[far lands]] because they have fake chunks).
** Collecting or using items is impossible, as is placing, destroying or interacting with blocks in any way.
*** A bug in this version allows the selected item from the hotbar to be dropped.
** Viewing inventories and GUIs is possible, but it is not possible to interact with them.
*** The [[heads-up display]] is disabled, except for the cross hair when looking at a mob.
** Player selectors (in commands) can target spectators.
*** Using {{cmd|give}} on a spectator causes the item(s) to drop at their location.
** Spectators are not noticed by mobs, and do not trigger spawners or spawning.
*** A spectator's presence keeps a mob from [[despawning]].
** Only the [[void]] and {{cmd|kill}} can damage a spectator.
* Flying mode.
** Landing is not possible—the player can fly through the ground.
** The mouse scroll wheel, the sprint key, and the Slowness and Speed effects all affect the flying speed.
* First-person view through another player or mob's eyes.
** Left-clicking an entity locks the player's position and camera to the entity's.
** The spectator cannot control where the entity moves or looks.
* Certain mobs have a different vision.
** Creeper applies the new creeper.json shader.
** Endermen applies the invert.json shader.
** Spider and cave spider apply the new spider.json shader.
* Viewing oneself using {{key|F5}} shows the entity.
* Pressing the dismount key ({{key|Shift}} by default) returns the player to flying mode.
* Viewing privileges.
** Spectators can see other spectators.
*** Appear as a translucent disembodied head.
*** The selected item from the hotbar is also visible.
** Invisible players and mobs appear visible, but translucent.

=== General ===
'''[[Shaders]]'''
* creeper.json.
** Shows the world in pixelated shades of green, similar to green.json.
** Is applied when the [[player]] uses Spectator mode on a [[creeper]].
* spider.json.
** A segmented-eyes effect.
** Is applied when the player uses Spectator mode on a [[spider]].

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added the following splashes:
** "pls rt"
** "Do you want to join my server?"
** "Put a little fence around it!"
** "Throw a blanket over it!"
** "One day, somewhere in the future, my work will be quoted!"
** "Now with additional stuff!"
** "Extra things!"

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Activator rail]]'''
* Powered activator rails now shake minecarts, causing riders to dismount.

'''[[End portal (block)]]'''
* Inventory image is now the missing texture instead of the nether portal.

=== Items ===
'''[[Armor]]'''
* No longer gets colored when mobs/players are hurt.

'''[[Written book]]s'''
* Copying written books now marks them as copies/copies of copies.
* The copying status of a book (i.e. original, copy of original or copy of a copy) is denoted in a separate line in the tooltip, beneath the author's name.
* Copies of copies cannot be copied.

=== General ===
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Text now has a background.
* Replaced x, y, z, b, bl and other labels with more understandable labels.
* "Light" is now the light levels at feet, not eyes.
* Currently missing LC value.
* [[Redwood Taiga Hills M]] biome now shows its name in worlds created since [[13w49a]].
** Worlds created from [[13w36a]] to [[13w48b]] that already generated chunks with the biome don't show it in the debug screen, as they show [[Mega Spruce Taiga]] instead. In these worlds, Redwood Taiga Hills M generates normaly but it only shows in the debug screen in newly chunks generated since [[13w49a]].

'''GUI code'''
* Improvements to allow "cooler things".<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|428161570867519488|Trying to clean up the GUI code so that we can do cooler things. This is both fun and not fun.|January 28, 2014}}</ref>
