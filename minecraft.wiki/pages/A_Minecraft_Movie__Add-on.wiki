{{Quote|When the Overworld and Nether clash, you’d better be equipped! Wield powerful weapons and fight vicious piglins from A Minecraft Movie in this free add-on.

== Trivia ==
* [[A Minecraft Movie Live Event]] uses the same piglins, battleaxes and buck-chuckets models as the addon, but the server redesigns the textures to be more similar to the style of RealismCraft, another project by Spark Universe.
* There is a glitch in the anti-zombification mechanic that makes it not work on normal [[Piglin|Piglins]], Piglin Brutes, and baby torch piglins. Despite this, Piglin Brutes appear in the pictures demonstrating the add-on and are not zombifying in the Overworld.
