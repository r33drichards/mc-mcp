A '''vault''' is a [[block]] found in [[trial chambers]] that ejects loot when unlocked using a [[trial key]]. Each vault can be opened by an unlimited number of [[players]], but each player can unlock a specific vault only once.<ref name="Minecraft Monthly">{{ytl|gbCSAffHr0w|REVEALING A NEW BLOCK + TRIAL KEY UNLOCKS...??? {{!}} MINECRAFT MONTHLY|Minecraft|January 26, 2024|t=4m}}</ref>

== Obtaining ==
Vaults can be obtained only by the [[Creative inventory]], using {{Control|pick block}}, or executing [[commands]].

=== Breaking ===
A vault has no tool associated with it and does not drop anything when destroyed.
{{breaking row|Vault|drop=0|horizontal=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
[[File:Vaultrender3.png|thumb|200px|A vault, as it appears in [[trial chambers]].]]
In [[trial chambers]], vaults can generate naturally in all rooms that also contain [[trial spawner]]s, as well as the entrance room. They are found generated on small pedestals made of waxed [[cut copper block]]s and [[cut copper slab]]s.

== Usage ==
=== Activation ===
When a player is within 3.0 blocks of a vault, it becomes active and begins emitting flame [[particles]] inside of it. If the player has not unlocked the vault before (i.e. if the player is not in its [[#Player limit|list of players]]), a stream of orange particles flows from the player to the vault's keyhole. The vault becomes inactive if there are no players within 4.0 blocks who have not unlocked the vault.

When active, a vault idly cycles between items once every second, visually displaying the current item inside the block. Each time the vault cycles to a new item, the item is randomly chosen from the loot table ({{slink||Loot}}). Small orange particles also appear in front of the vault as if they were being sucked into the keyhole.

=== Unlocking ===
[[File:Vault Ejecting Loot Screenshot.png|thumb|A vault in the process of ejecting loot.]]
When a trial key is {{control|used}} on a vault, it ejects items. Items are ejected one stack at a time with a burst of particles for each stack.

While a vault is ejecting items, it will briefly show the next item to be ejected. This should not be confused with the random items displayed while the vault is idle. These random item displays ''cannot'' be used for timing the unlocking, as the items to eject are rolled independently of whatever the idle display shows.

When a vault is finished ejecting items, it becomes inactive until another player approaches it.

Each vault can be unlocked only once per player. Vaults are intended to reward each player for completing each trial chamber one time. This gives every player in a [[world]] the opportunity to find their own loot without having to travel substantial distances to find undiscovered loot at a fresh structure.

{{anchor|Player limit}}
Each vault keeps track of up to 128 unique players that have opened it. If the list of players is full and another opens the vault, the new player is added to the end of the list while the first known player is forgotten and becomes able to open the vault again. Because of this, any item dropped by vaults is functionally [[renewable]] with enough players.<ref>{{bug|MC-274049|||WAI}}</ref>

=== Loot ===
A vault ejects 2 to 5 stacks of loot, which can sometimes include a few unstackable items. It ejects a combination of loot from three different loot tables. The following information describes the loot ejected for a single [[player]] when a single [[trial key]] is {{control|used}}.
* Common loot
** Every vault gives between one and three sets of common loot, corresponding the 3rd and 6th columns below.
** A vault that does not give rare loot gives an additional set of common loot, making it possible to get 4 sets of common loot.
* Rare loot
** {{IN|je}}, every vault has an 80% chance to include a set of rare loot.
** {{IN|be}}, every vault has a 20% chance to include a set of rare loot.
** The loot listed in the 2nd and 5th columns below corresponds with the chance of one set of rare loot, plus the chance of the one set of common loot that can be used in its place.
* Unique loot
** Every vault has a 25% chance to also include one set of unique loot.
** This loot, and the 75% chance for each vault to not have this loot, corresponds with the 4th and 7th columns below.

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* During unseen development, the texture of a vault had blue eyes, but the eyes were later changed to be orange to match the eyes seen on the [[trial spawner]].<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1751177169651298356|The original key texture was never aimed at the Deep Dark, it's just that an older texture of Vaults had blue eyes instead of orange ones. We opted to change it so that both Vaults and Trial Spawners had the same eye color.|January 27, 2024}}</ref>
* Vaults were inspired by {{w|Gashapon|gashapon machines|newtab=1}}, which are vending machines that dispense capsuled toys.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBr8BBrk1v8</ref>
