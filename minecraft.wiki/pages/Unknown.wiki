'''Unknown''' is a placeholder block exclusive to {{BE}} that generates in place where blocks have an invalid ID or invalid components in their [[Add-on|behavior files]].
If the block has a unique model, it takes the shape of that model.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The unknown block drops itself when broken, and breaks instantly with any tool.

=== Natural generation ===
Loading a block with an incorrect [[Bedrock_Edition_data_values#Block_IDs|ID]] in any world results in it being replaced by an unknown block, although it retains its ID. The ID is not retained upon being broken. Often caused by corruption or force opening a world of a higher version than the client, as the game does not recognize the id of newer blocks. An example of Unknown naturally generating is when you place a block that was added from an Add-on then said Add-on is removed.

== Behavior ==
The unknown block breaks instantly, and is able to be placed if it has been converted to the {{code|unknown}} identifier. If it still retains the invalid identifier, such as when obtained via {{control|pick block}}, it cannot be placed, though it flashes briefly on the client. Like ice, it has low friction.

== Sounds ==
{{Expand section}}
The unknown block makes no sound when placed or broken.
