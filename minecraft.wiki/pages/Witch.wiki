'''Witches''' are [[hostile mob|hostile mobs]] that use potions in [[combat]], using various [[Splash Potion|splash potions]] for offense and [[Potion|drinkable potions]] for defense.

==Spawning==
{{main|Tutorial:Witch farming}}
A witch may [[Mob spawning|spawn]] in the [[Overworld]] above [[Opacity|opaque]] blocks at a [[Light#Light level|light level]] of 0 in all [[biome]]s except for [[mushroom fields]] and [[deep dark]]. {{IN|Bedrock}}, witches also do not spawn in [[River|rivers]], [[Frozen River|frozen rivers]], and [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]]. Witches always spawn individually. Witches are the only mobs that can spawn in the small area around a swamp hut. 

[[Swamp]] biomes feature [[swamp hut]]s, which spawn a witch and a black [[cat]] inside during [[world generation]], and both never despawn. After world generation, only witches can spawn in the hut, provided that the entire hut is inside a swamp biome. 

{{IN|java}}, only witches spawn in the 7×7×9 volume that is the hut, which is the size of the roof and one block over the porch, from one level below the floor of the hut to two blocks above the roof. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, the hut has a hardcoded spawn spot on which witches spawn: the spawn spot is the same for every hut.

Some witches always spawn as part of [[raids]] starting from wave 4 {{in|bedrock}} or wave 3 or 4 {{in|java}} depending on the world [[Difficulty#World settings|difficulty]].

A [[villager]] transforms into a witch when [[lightning]] strikes within four blocks from it. A witch transformed from a villager does not despawn naturally and cannot be changed back into a villager. This witch attacks the player with its potions even if the player [[trading|traded]] with it before.

A witch has an 8.5% chance of dropping a [[potion]], if it is killed while drinking it and kill credit is given to a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]]. The chance is increased by 1% for every level of Looting. The following potions can be drank by a witch and can therefore be dropped:
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Healing}}
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Fire Resistance}}
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Swiftness}}
*{{ItemLink|Potion of Water Breathing}}

{{xp|5}} [[experience]] is dropped when kill credit is given to a player or tamed wolf.

==Behavior==
[[File:WitchParticles.png|thumb|The magical effect made of purple [[particle]]s that witches emit from time to time.]]
A witch is occasionally surrounded by purple morning star-shaped particles.  Every second, there is a 1.5% chance for 10 to 44 ornamental particles to appear above its head, representing shining stars named “witch” {{in|Java}} or “witchspell” {{in|Bedrock}}. 

{{IN|java}}, any witch is given the [[Glowing]] [[status effect]] for three seconds when the [[bell]] block is rung within 32 blocks of it, regardless of whether it participates in raids or not. A witch is neither an [[illager]] nor a villager, although it resembles one.

A witch cannot use housing or the equipment in their [[swamp hut]]s, and cannot open [[door]]s.

Witches don't attack villagers and [[wandering trader]]s when participating in raids, although their potions can hit one by accident. Witches that participate in a raid seek out [[illager]]s and [[ravager]]s to throw splash potions of [[Regeneration]] with a duration of 45 seconds near them or [[Instant Health]] if they have a low health of {{hp|4}} points or less.

The [[poison]], [[instant damage]], [[evoker fangs]], [[Warden#Attacks|warden's sonic boom]], and [[Thorns]] Enchantment magical sources are 85% less effective against witches {{In|Java}} and 95% less effective {{in|Bedrock}}

A witch pursues the player within 16 blocks and uses potions of the first level in [[combat]], throwing [[splash potion]]s offensively and drinking [[potion]]s defensively. These potions are the same as ones obtainable through [[brewing]], with the same duration. A witch has an infinite stock of potions, even when transformed from a villager or not having had any potions equipped in their [[inventory]]. Each potion chosen by the witch depends on the circumstance and is thrown within ten blocks and in a three-second interval.
*The witch throws a splash potion of [[Slowness]] if the target is eight, nine or ten blocks away and does not already have the Slowness effect. This makes it harder for the player or mob to escape if they attempt to.
*The witch throws a splash potion of [[Poison]] if the target's health is at least {{hp|8}} and is not already poisoned.
*The witch has a 25% chance of throwing a [[splash potion]] of [[Weakness]] if a target is less than three blocks away and does not already have the Weakness effect. Also, the target's [[health]] has to be at {{hp|8}} or less, or the target has to have the [[Poison]] effect. This is used to weaken the player or mob's [[melee attack]]s on the witch if they attempt to attack the witch. This can be used to cure a [[zombie villager]] into a [[villager]], if the zombie villager is in the range of the splash potion.
*If none of the above conditions are true, the witch defaults to using a splash potion of [[Harming]], which does {{hp|6}} magical [[damage]].

A witch can choose to equip and drink a potion each [[game tick]] ({{frac|1|20}} second) if it is not already drinking a potion. Drinking the potion takes 1.6 seconds<ref>In the [[Java Edition Combat Test 8c|current Java combat test]] "8c" version, the witch drinks in one second.</ref> and slows down its moving speed a little. The witch does not attack during this time.
*When the [[hitbox]] of the witch is 80% under [[water]] and the witch is lacking the [[Water Breathing]] status effect, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of Water Breathing.
*When the witch is on fire or the last damage taken by it in the past two seconds was fire damage, there is a 15% chance of drinking a potion of [[Fire Resistance]].
*When the witch is not at full health, there is a 5% chance of drinking a [[potion of Healing]] which heals {{hp|4}}.<ref>It heals {{hp|6}} in the [[Java Edition Combat Test 8c|current Java combat test]] version.</ref>
*When the witch is eleven or more blocks from a target and does not have the [[Speed]] effect, there is a 50% chance of drinking a potion of Swiftness.

Witches still can be killed through [[suffocation]], [[cacti]], or [[wither rose]]s, but due to their frequent use of potions of Healing, this requires constant damage output for 40–50 seconds. Additionally, witches cannot drown or die from fire unless they already are at low health. Witches usually die in lava, even at full health, when drinking a potion of Healing first instead of [[potion of Fire Resistance]].

When in a raid, if all the villagers in a [[village]] die or all the village [[bed]]s are destroyed, witches jump and play unique sound effects in commemoration to their victory. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, witches attack [[iron golem]]s and [[snow golem]]s or any mob that attacks it, including other witches and illagers, throwing harmful splash potions.

{{IN|Java}}, witches drink a beneficial potion, often an instant-health healing potion, when they are attacked by [[evoker fangs]], illager mobs or harming potions from other witches and join an illager patrol if sufficiently near to the [[pillager]], [[vindicator]], [[evoker]] and [[illusioner]] patrol captain mobs. Even though witches do not attack villagers or wandering traders during raids, the witches that join a [[patrol]] are hostile toward villagers, wandering traders and iron golems in the patrol sight.  

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the green "lamp" in the witch's hat is emissive similar to spider and enderman eyes.

|Witches use [[splash potion]]s, such as [[Poison]], [[Weakness]], [[Instant Damage|Instant Harming]] or [[Slowness]] to fight [[the player]].
|When drinking a potion, a witch's nose lifts and points forward. A witch's nose slightly wiggles when idle. Witches have small mouths hidden under their noses.
