The '''Nether portal''' block is the translucent part of the [[Nether portal]] that teleports the player to and from [[the Nether]].

== Obtaining ==
The Nether portal block cannot be obtained as an item even by using the {{cmd|give}} command. The item form is completely non-existent {{in|java}}, but it can be obtained through [[add-on]]s, external editors or by using bugs {{in|bedrock}}.

The Nether portal block can be placed using commands such as {{cmd|fill}} or {{cmd|setblock}} and is generated when lighting a [[Nether portal]].

== Usage ==
{{see also|Nether portal}}

Nether portal blocks can stably exist only within a Nether portal structure, unlike [[End Portal (block)|End portal block]]s. When the block is updated and detects it is not part of such a structure, it is destroyed. However, using [[update suppression]] glitches, it is possible to obtain a standalone portal block without a frame, but the portal is destroyed once it receives an update, i.e. placing a block next to the portal or moving a piston next to or into the portal.

Nether portal blocks can be used to teleport entities between [[the Nether]] and the [[Overworld]]. When a player in the Overworld or the Nether stands in a Nether portal block for 4 seconds, the player is taken to the other dimension. While in the Nether portal block, the player can neither open their [[inventory]] nor interact with blocks with GUI. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. However, in Creative mode there is no wait time—the player immediately transfers between dimensions. If there is already an ''active'' portal within range (125 blocks) in the other world, the player appears in that portal. Otherwise, a portal is created at or near the corresponding coordinates. If a single portal block is placed using commands, it can still be used to travel to the Nether.

Nether portal blocks make distinctive sounds, and emit the same purple particles produced by [[endermen]], [[endermite]]s, and [[ender chest]]s. Portal blocks emit a [[light level]] of 11, dimmer than a [[torch]].

[[Falling block]] entities can be teleported through a portal, but a piston cannot push a block through.

Much like [[water]] or [[lava]], portal blocks cannot be broken by tools except in Creative. However, portal blocks ''can'' be destroyed by [[explosion]]s (even weak ones) and can be replaced by placing [[water]] or [[lava]] sources in the same block (can also be done by [[dispenser]]s). If any portal block is destroyed, the whole portal is deactivated as adjacent portal blocks are updated and detect that the portal structure is no longer complete.

While Nether portals themselves cannot be lit in [[the End]], a portal block set in the End and in [[custom dimension]]s behave exactly like in the Overworld, calculating coordinates in the Nether with the same 1:8 ratio. They teleport players to the Nether {{in|java}}, and to the Overworld {{in|bedrock}}.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Nether portal blocks cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s. They also cannot be pushed or pulled by sticky pistons.

* "It is now possible to smash Nether portals by simply punching them." was listed as a change that happened at some point in 1.0.0. Testing reveals it doesn't happen at all in Survival mode, so was this meant to refer to Creative and that detail was left out?
* "The Nether portal has been changed, having a slightly darker look." listed for Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4 in the main Nether portal page. I can't seem to find any visual changes to Nether portals in this version at all.}}
