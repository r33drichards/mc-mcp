An '''other portal''' is a joke [[block]] which was added as part of the 2023 [[Java Edition]] [[April Fools' Day jokes|April Fools' Day joke]] snapshot [[Java Edition 23w13a or b|23w13a_or_b]]. It was added as a reference to the [https://aether.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Aether Aether], a popular mod for Minecraft which added a fourth [[dimension]] to the game. This became a joke when players would attempt to build portals to the Aether in vanilla Minecraft and fail.<ref>https://imgflip.com/m/gaming/tag/aether+portal?sort=top-2020</ref>

== Obtaining ==
The shape of the [[other portal]] is similar to a [[Nether portal]], except that it uses [[glowstone]] instead.

It also uses a [[water bucket]] instead of a [[flint and steel]] to light the portal.

The Other Portal must be enabled by having <code>minecraft:other_portal</code>

== Usage ==
When entering the Other Portal, the player is teleported 500 blocks upward, and the message "'''''Error 404 Terrain Not Found'''''" is displayed.

If the portal is created above Y=200, it teleports players to Y=650 instead, so they aren't teleported to [[the Moon]].
