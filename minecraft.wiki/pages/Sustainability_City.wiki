'''Sustainability City''', also known as '''Sustainability Town''', is a ''[[Minecraft Education]]'' map designed to teach renewable resources.<ref>{{Cite|url=https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/resources/science-subject-kit/sustainability|title=Explore Energy Efficiency in the Urban Space|website=education.minecraft.net}}</ref> It can also be played through the [[Marketplace]].

== Summary ==
The map begins inside a classroom, with upturned [[stairs]] for desks, a chalkboard <!-- The chalkboard is not a board, but it is actually a painting --> on a [[bricks|brick]] wall, and a [[NPC|teacher]]. {{control|Interacting}} with them gives six choices for different lessons. Upon selecting one, orange [[particles]] appear beside the [[door]], leading to the setting of the lesson. If the player wishes to return to the classroom, in the [[inventory]] is an item that can [[teleport]] them back, alongside a stack of [[steak]] and a [[written book]] giving additional tips.

{{Collapse|content=Welcome to Sustainability Town!

TIPS

-The teacher can send you on lessons.

-Follow the sparkles when on a lesson.

-Interact with people to talk to them and move the lesson along.

-You have a blackboard in your hotbar, you can use it to return to the classroom.

-There are electric busses in each area, you can use them to travel around town.}}

Outside the classroom is an alleyway of [[smooth stone]], with an office directly opposing the building holding the class, containing a desk and [[sea lanterns]] inside, and three sets of [[oak door]]s. Behind both is a playground, with a jungle gym made of recycled [[fence|wood]] and a nearby [[stone slab]]. Beside it is a swingset, made of similar materials with added [[iron bars]] and [[slabs]]. Standing on the seats give one second of [[levitation]] to replicate swinging. At the edge of the playground is a teeter totter, which dynamically turns relative to a player's position. All three installations have nearby [[signs]] crediting them for being made of recycled materials.

=== Food Production ===
Food Production is a short walk to the left, into a market building with "fruit blocks" displayed in windows. Inside is an NPC named ''Where does your food come from?'' They ask the question again, and wonders if there is a farm anywhere. After finishing the interaction, players are led to the back, near [[honey bottle]]s, to an NPC named ''Produce Clerk''. Saying "don't tell the boss but I'll let you through here," players can leave the building and travel across the street to a farmer NPC's house. The farmer greets the player and lets them into the house.

Entering through [[dark oak door]]s, players are led down a hallway, past a living room with a [[brick]] [[campfire|fireplace]] and kitchen with [[shulker box]] fridge, out into a farm. If the player is interested, they can also explore a three story house, with [[beds]] and chests on the second floor and [[barrels]] in the attic. Outside on a bridge is an NPC named ''Agricultural Runoff'', who explains irrigation, and points the player to two NPCs named ''Irrigation Tech'' by a large machine watering [[carrot crop]]s. Behind them is another NPC, ''Cover Crops'', amongst several [[ferns]] on [[farmland]], and after speaking to them the player is led to two NPCs named ''Crop Rotation''. Speaking to the second NPC causes the time to flux, rapidly shifting between [[day]] and [[night]] as crops are grown and replaced. Not far from there is an NPC named ''Compost Spreading'', standing before a tractor dispelling [[compost]].

An NPC labeled simply ''Compost'' stands behind a [[fence]], standing in front of a large pile of compost, who suggests the player to follow a series of trucks to "see how compost is made." Beside the trucks is an NPC, ''What is Compost?'', who greets the player and welcomes them to the Composting Facility. Amongst compost is an NPC named ''Finished Compost'', who explains the windrow has been sitting for 12 weeks and only now finished. Another NPC, near podzol windrows, named ''Windrows'' stands behind them, and talking to them leads to Mixing and ''Aeration'', ''Decomposition'', ''Shredding'', and finally ''Biosolids'', who transports the player to another facility.

=== Water Treatment ===
Water Treatment is a walk to the right of the classroom, beyond a crosswalk into a [[granite]] building. Players interact with an NPC named ''Out-flow Reclamation'', who explains that the building is the "out-flow reclamation site" and that tout-flow is sink water. Another nearby NPC, ''Bar Screens'', explains that screens are used to prevent contamination from wipes and lumber. Behind them are five NPCs standing in a line: ''Grit Chambers'', ''Preventing Clogs'', ''Primary Clarification'', a second ''Primary Clarification'', and ''Aeration''. Around the corner are two more, ''Secondary Clarification'' and ''Disinfection''.

After interacting with every NPC, players can progress over to a hedge of [[birch leaves]] up stairs to another NPC, ''Irrigation''. Irrigation explains that a plant behind them is used to distribute water to a farm. Following the trail of water leads to a [[river]], being watched by an NPC named ''Return to the Water System'', who explains that the water is returned to the water system. Around the corner is an NPC named ''Bio-Solids'', who after asking the player to "compost" teleports them to an area made of [[coarse dirt]] and [[podzol]], before another NPC, ''Biosolids''. After speaking to Biosolids, the player is sent back to Bio-Solids, concluding the lesson.

=== Green Building ===
Green Building is a short walk from the school, passing by a brick building with a [[nether quartz]] fountain and an electric bus, leading up to two NPCs. On the left is ''Heat'', who explains energy requirements and that a nearby building is heated by pipes, and on the right is ''Geo-Thermal'' who explains how seasons affect building temperatures. Upon speaking to both NPCs, the building behind them is miraculously finished, a new trail of particles leading the player inside of the building.

After walking through a [[glass]] entrance, players must advance across a black [[carpet]]ed up a small stairway, and meet an NPC labeled ''Wonderful Stairway''. Wonderful Stairway explains the buildings stairways are surrounded by glass and made from "beautiful materials so that you can't resist climbing them." What matters is that they take less energy than elevators. Upon finishing the interaction, the player and Wonderful Stairway are transported up a flight of stairs, and a new trail of orange particles leading the player up another, where an NPC explains the greywater system. In order to progress, the player must jump into the greywater system themselves, which is right next to the NPC.

Inside the greywater system, players must {{control|swim}} upward into a narrow shaft lined with [[soul sand]] at the bottom, being deposited into a balcony garden. Standing guard before the garden is Synthetic Wetland, who explains how greywater is cleaned. Progressing past them is ''Composting Toilets'', who establishes that toilet waste is transported into [[composters]], and that these specific toilets use 96% less water than normal ones. From there players must return to the stairway, and meet the NPC ''Regenerating Elevator'' on the above floor, where they explain what a regenerator is. Inside the elevator is a red [[button]], which when {{control|used}} leads to another floor, where the player meets an NPC called ''Lighting and Windows'' that explains that the exterior windows are designed to maximize natural light, reducing energy costs for artificial lights. Talking to them causes the windows to appear.

Following another trail up stairs, the player ends up on the roof of the building and meets an NPC called ''Heat Exchange'' who explains the importance of ventilation while standing in front of a visual representation using orange and cyan orbs. After that the player is tasked with climbing up [[scaffolding]] into a crane to meet with ''Solar Roof'', who explains the goal of the building project: to produce as much energy as they use. The roof of the building is lined with solar panels that collects most of its energy in summer to use during winter. Speaking to Solar Roof again reveals the crane is ready to be dismantled, asking to "walk you out."

=== Sustainable Forestry ===
This lesson is reached across the street from the school, passing through a hedge maze. Inside the maze is an NPC named ''Huh?'', who says they are hiding and gives the player an [[oak planks]] block after being spoken to. Opposite the school and maze is a lumber yard, where an NPC named ''Lumber Yard'' welcomes the player. At the end of the mill is another NPC named ''Lumber Yard'', who says they store lumber in the facility. Behind them is a stairway with [[wood|wooden]] [[slabs]], near several extra tall [[spruce sapling]]s, at the top an NPC named ''Sustainable Forestry and Management Cycle''. The latter demonstrates the 40-year life cycle of trees, causing 40 years to occur within a moment.

After watching that unfold, the player walks up a road to an NPC named ''Conservation'', who recommends an overlook of the town at the end of a trail. Passing through a nature trail of [[spruce]] trees, [[tall grass]], a [[poppy]], and [[stone]], at the top is a hiker, complementing the view. After speaking to them, players are led back to the road, where a Hectares rests. Speaking to them, the lesson is finished.

=== Energy Efficient Housing ===
In order to reach this lesson, players must take a bus, selecting the House option. Appearing at a house, players can approach an NPC named ''Sustainable Materials'' beside slabs and [[gravel]], explaining the use of renewable resources from previous lessons. Another NPC, ''Energy Efficient Housing'', explains their plan to build a new house with less impact on the environment. The proceeding trail of particles lead into the house, with an NPC explaining drains off the path, and an NPC named ''Insulation'' at the end. On the second floor is an NPC named Ventilation, and two more NPCs both named ''Window Film and Smart Blinds''. Speaking to them adds window film to the walls, represented by [[trapdoors]], and binds, represented by closing the trapdoor while time cycles around them.

Dropping down onto the ground, players climb scaffolding up to an NPC named ''Passive Energy Collection'', working on solar panels on a roof. After speaking to them, players enter into the house through a hole in the roof, passing into a [[pink wool]] floored room down a [[ladder]] into another room before climbing scaffolding down to an NPC named ''Furnace'', standing near two [[blast furnace]]s. Pulling a lever turn on the furnace.

=== Power Grid ===
Much like the fifth lesson, this mission begins by having to use the bus. Players arrive at a large curved, slanted building made of gray [[concrete]], with the NPC ''Hydro-Electric Power'' standing outside, holding a book, who welcomes the player into a power plant, inviting the player inside. At the top of a cold set of stairs is an NPC named ''Penstock, Reservoir, and Turbine'', who explains penstocks, reservoirs, and turbines. Slightly above is the NPC called ''Mechanical Energy'', who explains nearby spinning gears. Through an [[acacia door]] lies a bridge with the NPC ''Generator'', and slightly elevated is an optional second Generator.

Passing by Generator leads to the NPC ''Pumped Storage'', standing inside a room full of machines. At the end of the room is a balcony with the NPC ''Clean Energy'', directing the player up to a wind turbine. Climbing a ladder, players can be explained how wind power works, by an NPC named Wind Power. After speaking to them, a trail of particles lead the player up a ladder, however another NPC, ''Power Grid'', lays slightly out of view by a stairway below the ladder. At the top is an NPC named ''How does wind make Electricity?'' who gives the players instructions to climb up and press a button. Pressing the button requires {{control|sneaking}} on the edge of [[blocks of iron]] against a [[wall]], before the player returns to Power Grid and has to summon a [[minecart]] to ride across a power grid.

Riding across the [[rails|electrical lines]] leads the player to ''Water Treatment Plant'', who can summon an additional minecart if needed. Continuing on the path leads to ''Sustainable Farming'', ''Waste to Energy Plant'', and ''Energy Efficient House'', with similar capabilities. Ultimately, players reach ''Landfill Bioreactor'', who recommends climbing down to the ground to "find a very interesting way of returning energy to the grid." Following a trail of particles on the ground leads to three NPCs named ''Decomposition'', ''Aerobic Bioreactor'', and ''Methane Gas Collection'', standing in front of a bioreactor emitting green smoke out of [[slime block|non-recyclable materials]]. Upon interacting with them, players can return to the line, and meet ''Green City'', who directs the player to ''Waste to Energy Plant''.

Once again climbing down, players arrive in a paved area, meeting ''Collection Bunkers'' before a large animated claw, who tells the player to head inside to learn more about energy power. Climbing up a walkway, the player can find ''Furnace Hoppers'', ''Incineration'', ''Boiler'', ''More to Learn'', ''Air Scrubbers'', and ''Closed Water System''. Climbing down a ladder by Boiler, players can meet ''Steam Power'', then climb up and find ''Energy Surplus''.
