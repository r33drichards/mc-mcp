'''Fields''' are a grassy biome, added in [[Java Edition 24w14potato|24w14potato]]. They generate in the [[Potato dimension]].

== Description ==
There are almost no trees in this biome, only [[oak]]s generate sparsely. 

Surface of the fields is covered in [[Peelgrass Block|peelgrass]] block. [[Short Grass|Short]] and [[Tall Grass|tall grass]], many [[flower]]s (including [[potato flower]]s) and normal [[potato]] plants grow on top of it. 

"Potato field" features generate commonly, making up a large percentage of the biome's surface. Here, potato plants grow on top of [[Poison Farmland|poison farmland]], which is hydrated by water blocks (although hydration doesn't reach every farmland block), with [[Poison Path|poison paths]] and sometimes [[Potato Fence|potato fences]] between fields. Some [[lantern]]s can also generate, lighting up the biome.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs naturally spawn here:
