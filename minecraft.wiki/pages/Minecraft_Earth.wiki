'''''Minecraft Earth''''' was<!-- do not change this to "is"; the game is no longer downloadable or playable --> a free-to-play {{w|augmented reality}} (AR) spin-off mobile game developed by [[Mojang Studios]] and published by {{w|Xbox Game Studios}} for {{w|iOS}}, {{w|iPadOS}}, and {{w|Android (operating system)|Android}}. The game was about building structures and collecting materials by traveling to real-life locations. The first closed beta in the US released on July 16, 2019, and was released worldwide on December 11, 2019. It received its [[MCE:0.33.0|last update]] on January 5, 2021, and was officially shut down on June 30, 2021 as a result of the {{w|COVID-19 pandemic}}.<ref name=":3">{{Mcnet|minecraft-earth-coming-end|Minecraft Earth is coming to an end|January 5, 2021}}</ref> All players who made a purchase in the game received a free copy of {{BE}}, even if they had one already, and any remaining paid balance of [[MCE:Ruby|rubies]] were exchanged for [[Minecoin]]s.<ref name=":3" />

== Design ==
''Minecraft Earth'' was an adaptation of the traditional ''[[Minecraft]]'' experience to an augmented-reality setting, similarly to ''Ingress'' and ''Pokémon GO''.<ref name=":0" /> The game itself was the first ''Minecraft'' spin-off that was built on the [[Bedrock Edition|''Bedrock'']] engine, and featured many unique gameplay aspects and similar interactions to the main game.<ref name=":0">{{citation|url=https://theverge.com/2019/5/17/18627341/minecraft-earth-ios-android-free-ar-game-features-pokemon-go|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://theverge.com/2019/5/17/18627341/minecraft-earth-ios-android-free-ar-game-features-pokemon-go|title=Minecraft Earth goes a step beyond Pokémon Go to cover the world in blocks|website=The Verge|author=Tom Warren|date=May 17, 2019}}</ref>

''Minecraft Earth'' required an Xbox Live account to play the game<ref name=":1">{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://earth.minecraft.net/en-us/sign-up|title=Minecraft Earth &vert; Sign Up for Updates|website=earth.minecraft.net}}</ref> and used Microsoft Azure Spatial Anchors along with {{w|OpenStreetMap}} to power location-based gameplay. The technology synced the position of buildplates in multi-player by referencing objects in the real world, creating a seamless experience.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{citation|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/how-minecraft-earth-gameplay-works|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.windowscentral.com/how-minecraft-earth-gameplay-works|title=Minecraft Earth gameplay detailed: Adventures, world map, hunger, Tappables, and Build Plates|website=Windows Central|author=Jez Corden}}</ref><ref name="FAQ">{{link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101015541/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360033744412-Minecraft-Earth-FAQs|title=Minecraft Earth FAQs|website=help.minecraft.net}}</ref>

It was announced that [[the Nether]] and [[the End]] were planned for ''Minecraft Earth'' in a future update,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212211551/https://playminecraftearth.com/minecraft-earth-q-and-a-nether-end-breeding-adventures-crafting/|title=The Nether, Breeding, Adventures And More. Minecraft Earth Q&A 2 Summary|website=playminecraftearth.com|author=Jack Hullis}}</ref> but these plans were scrapped due to the game being discontinued.<ref name=":3" />

== Gameplay ==
{{see also|MCE:Exclusive features}}
[[File:MC Earth gameplay.jpg|thumb|Gameplay of ''Minecraft Earth''.]]
In ''Minecraft Earth'', players were allowed to build structures with other players and "place them in the real world at life-size".<ref name="FAQ" />

In the [[MCE:Map|map view]], players were allowed to see their character, which was able to be changed with skins owned from the marketplace or generated using the Character Creator. Scattered around the maps were [[MCE:Tappable|tappables]]. If a [[MCE:Tappable|tappable]] was within a player's collection range, the player could tap it and collect items. There were multiple types of tappables, including stone, grass, ponds, chests, and mobs.

=== Adventures ===
{{main|MCE:Adventure}}
Adventures appeared on the map but were also allowed to be spawned using Adventure Crystals. Adventures were the survival aspect of ''Minecraft Earth''. Players were allowed to fight mobs, collect additional resources that are unavailable with [[MCE:Tappable|tappables]], and collect rewards. Adventures were only allowed to be played in life-size mode.

=== Buildplates ===
{{main|MCE:Buildplate}}
Buildplates were worlds that players used to build on. They were shared remotely for viewing, and worked on by invited players in the same location.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

Buildplates were 8&times;8, 16&times;16 or 32&times;32 blocks in size, and their build height limit was 221 blocks.<ref>{{Cite Discord|url=https://discordapp.com/channels/579700549780242492/584117454775779329/646068053427224606|title=Buildplate height limit is 221|channel=minecraft-earth|server=Minecraft Earth|invite=https://discord.gg/minecraftearth|user=Pyroclasm|date=18 November, 2019|ss=Pyroclasm on Build Plate Height.png}}</ref> From ground level, a buildplate also extended downward in varying depth, depending on the buildplate. The minimum depth before bedrock appeared after digging down was 3 blocks and the buildplate with the maximum recorded depth was 12 blocks<ref name="jungle_plate">This was the default 8x8 jungle buildplate rewarded for reaching level 15.</ref>

Using the shop, players were allowed to buy new plots using [[MCE:Ruby|rubies]]. Plots were also earned via a leveling system.

Buildplates functioned like personal realms and were used anywhere. They ran in the ''Bedrock'' Engine, meaning redstone, physics, and other mechanics were identical to ''Bedrock Edition''. Players were allowed to invite friends to build with them locally and then share the world to others via a link.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

A player was allowed to interact with a buildplate in miniature and life-size modes. In miniature mode, the buildplate functioned the same as [[Creative]] mode in ''[[Minecraft]]'', allowing the player to build structures and populate the buildplate with mobs. In life-size mode, the buildplate functioned the same as [[Survival]] mode, in which the player must use tools to interact with blocks. Hostile mobs on the buildplate attacked the player, and the player could lose health and life.

A planned feature for buildplates that was announced but never implemented was the ability to pin buildplates on the map for other players to view publicly.

Buildplates were also allowed to be shared via a link, so players were not required to be in the same location as the creator to see creations.<ref name=":0" /> The links shared were either temporary or never expired.<ref name=":0" /> Mojang Studios claimed to have a 24/7 moderation team, reviewing and looking at reports of inappropriate builds.<ref name=":0" />

[[MCE:Adventure|''Minecraft Earth'' adventures]] had their own buildplates, with predefined above-ground and underground structures and hostile mobs. Like user buildplates, an adventure plate was only allowed to be placed somewhere on the ground before interacting with it. Adventure buildplates weren't able to be saved or moved by a player although multiple players were allowed to interact with the same adventure at the same time.

=== Challenges ===
Similar to [[advancement]]s {{in|Java}} and [[achievement]]s {{in|Bedrock}}, challenges were tasks given to player to guide the player. Unlike [[advancement]]s, there were 3 types of challenges: Daily, Seasonal, and Tappable challenges. These challenges involved individual tasks; the player obtained rubies, experience, and credit after completing, i.e. if the player's task is to collect 6 ferns, and another challenge is to collect 4 ferns, and the player gets 2 ferns, it would apply to both tasks.

=== Gameplay differences from regular ''Minecraft'' ===
[[File:Inventory ME.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Inventory in ''Minecraft Earth'', showing that stacks of items and mobs appeared unlimited in size and quantity.]]
''Minecraft Earth'' offered somewhat different mechanics to players more familiar with ''Java'' or Bedrock editions of ''Minecraft''. These differences included:

* While players could build upward and dig downward, one could not climb or descend unless a real-world structure was available for said activity.
* There was no [[daylight cycle]]; buildplates and adventures always had the same lighting regardless of the real-world time of day. Some buildplates were available with night illumination.
* [[MCE:Inventory|Inventory]]:
** Inventory was effectively unlimited, both in inventory slots and the stack size of items or blocks.
** There was no inventory crafting grid, and no way to repair damaged items by combining them.
** There were no armor slots in the inventory.
** Mobs were allowed to be collected, and achievements were earned for collecting them. Occasionally a [[MCE:tappable|tappable]] dropped a hostile mob that was allowed to be collected and placed on a buildplate.
** Inventory was unaffected by death, as it was inaccessible during adventures. Only items in the [[hotbar]] and backpack (the items collected during an [[MCE:adventure|adventure]]) were lost.
* [[MCE:Make Stuff#Crafting|Crafting]]:
** Both crafting and smelting required a considerable amount of time, taking up to several minutes (or even hours) depending on the item. Like smelting in regular ''Minecraft'', the player was allowed to exit the crafting or smelting interface to do other things while the process completes.
** Several items could not be crafted, such as chests, crafting tables, armor, villager workstations, fishing rods, and anything related to enchantments or potions (anvils, enchanting tables, brewing stands, etc.).
* Tools and melee weapons had infinite range.
* Health and hunger were combined into one [[MCE:Health|health gauge bar]]. Health was depleted by mob attacks, and restored by eating food.
* Food could not be cooked in Survival mode (i.e. during an [[MCE:adventure|adventure]]), and was only allowed to be cooked outside of an adventure. Food was allowed to be eaten during an adventure and outside of an adventure.
* [[MCE:Iron Ingot|Iron ingot]]s were available only by smelting [[MCE:Iron Ore|iron ore]], which was rare and never dropped by tappables. Iron ore was obtained only via mining during an adventure, provided the adventure included any iron at all, and rarely when killing zombies, similar to ''Minecraft''.
* There was no way to craft or wear armor in the game. A player used tactics rather than armor for protection. Players were also allowed to obtain different clothing items, but these offer no armor protection.
* It was not possible to find chests as items, craft them, or store them in the player's inventory. They existed only as [[MCE:Tappable|tappables]].
* [[MCE:Ladder|Ladder]]s were available for construction, but they could not be climbed.
* [[MCE:Obsidian|Obsidian]] did not exist and could not be created. [[MCE:Lava|Lava]] flowing into [[MCE:Water|water]] formed [[MCE:cobblestone|cobblestone]], but lava was unaffected by water flowing onto it.

Other differences:

* Mini boosts were figurines that were tapped to the device's NFC reader giving temporary boosts to stats in-game, such as better defense or attack strength. Only five can be used at a time and the same boost.
* Adventure crystals were added for people isolating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adventure crystals allowed a player to experience a small, medium, large or huge adventure without having to go outside, provided the adventure had enough open area. They later ended by being a permanent feature to the game.<ref>[https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360061373332/comments/360010241151 "Hey, we absolutely will keep them! We added them because they're a great experience and we know players are really enjoying them!" - SevralTimez]</ref>

== Microtransactions ==
The game had full microtransactions.
The in game currency was ''[[MCE:Ruby|rubies]]'', which was not to be confused with ''Minecoins''.<ref name=":0" />

Rubies were used to:<ref>https://playminecraftearth.com/how-to-find-rubies-in-minecraft-earth-for-free</ref>

* Purchase [[MCE:Buildplate|buildplates]]
* Purchase [[MCE:Boost|boosts]]
* Purchase second and third slots for crafting and smelting
* Speed up [[MCE:Make Stuff|crafting and smelting]] tasks

''Minecoins'' were also used as a secondary currency in ''Minecraft Earth'', for purchasing skins and clothing.

In [[MCE:0.33.0|0.33.0]], the final update to ''Minecraft Earth'', all microtransactions had been removed in preparation for the game's shutting down on June 30, 2021.<ref name=":3" />

== Development ==
During Microsoft Build 2015, Microsoft's HoloLens team unveiled an augmented reality version of ''Minecraft'',<ref>{{link |title=HoloLens games are too good for HoloLens |url=https://theverge.com/2015/6/17/8794971/microsoft-hololens-minecraft-project-xray-hands-on-e3-2015 |website=The Verge |date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> internally codenamed "{{MCE|Minecraft Genoa}}". On May 6, 2019, Microsoft released a video on {{w|YouTube}}, where some features from ''Minecraft Earth'' were shown.<ref>{{YouTubeLink|UiX0dVXiGa8|What's Minecraft up to?}}</ref> On May 8, 2019, a trailer was released, showing some AR mods in ''Minecraft Earth''. On ''Minecraft'''s 10th anniversary (May 17, 2019), ''Minecraft Earth'' was officially announced.<ref>{{tweet|minecraftearth|1129372933565108224|Here’s the full-length, first-ever, look at Minecraft Earth!

=== Shutdown ===
On January 5, 2021, Mojang Studios released the final update to ''Minecraft Earth'', [[MCE:0.33.0|0.33.0]], and announced that the game's servers would be taken offline after June 30, 2021, with the reason being the global COVID-19 situation. On that day, the game was removed from the respective app stores.<ref name=":3" /> Players who open the app after that date are greeted with this message, which includes a link to information about the shutdown:
{{Q|Dear Minecraft Earth players,<br />We have been on an amazing adventure together, bringing the wonder of Minecraft into the real world. We have built masterpieces, collected amazing new mobs, and even dug deep into the ground on incredible Epic{{sic}} adventures.<br />We have made the difficult discussion{{sic}} to end support for Minecraft Earth as of June 30th, 2021.<br>Thanks for playing and we hope to see you in Minecraft.<br />– The Minecraft Earth Team}}
Returning players who logged in before the discontinuation received an exclusive [[Character Creator]] "Hero" outfit set. Moreover, any returning player who had a remaining paid ruby balance before the shutdown would receive a free copy of {{BE}}.

* Due to using the ''Bedrock'' engine, all of the textures in {{BE}} during the [[Village & Pillage]] update can be found in the files despite many being unused.
* One of the game's songs, "Earth", was featured as a newly arranged track in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as part of Challenger Pack 7.
