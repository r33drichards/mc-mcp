'''Pumpkin seeds''' are items obtained from pumpkins that can be used to grow pumpkin stems.

'''Pumpkin stems''' are plants grown on [[farmland]] that, over time, grow [[pumpkin]]s on dirt, mud and moss blocks adjacent to them.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{Breaking row|Pumpkin Stem, Attached Pumpkin Stem|link=none|horizontal=1}}

When broken, a pumpkin stem drops 0–3 pumpkin seeds. The chance for pumpkin seeds to drop increases with the stem's age.

=== Natural generation ===
Pumpkin stems generate naturally in stem farm rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s.

Pumpkin stems generate in [[taiga]] and [[snowy taiga]]{{only|be|short=1}} [[village]] farms.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|pumpkin-seeds}}

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|Pumpkin
|Output= Pumpkin Seeds,4
|type= Material
}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell pumpkin seeds for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
Shearing an uncarved pumpkin yields 4 pumpkin seeds {{in|java}}, and 1 {{in|bedrock}}.

== Usage ==
=== Farming ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Pumpkin and Melon farming}}
Pumpkin seeds can be planted only on [[farmland]], as stems. Pumpkin stems need a [[Light|light level]] of 9 or above to grow (in [[Bedrock Edition]] they need at least an [[Light#Internal light level|internal light level]] of 9). Over time, a stem grows through several stages and, at its final growth stage, produces [[pumpkin]]s on any adjacent [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[grass block]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]], [[pale moss block]], [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]. If a pumpkin is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem, it does not grow more pumpkins until the pumpkin is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of pumpkins. Pumpkin seeds are affected by [[bone meal]] only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual pumpkins.

=== Breeding ===
Like other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to breed [[chicken]]s, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.

=== Taming ===
Like other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to tame [[parrot]]s.

=== Composting ===
Placing pumpkin seeds into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Pumpkin stem ==
A '''pumpkin stem''' is the block that is planted on [[farmland]] when pumpkin seeds are used on it. It starts underground, and rises up as the plant grows. The stem is colored green when young, and then yellow once fully grown.

The stem curves once a pumpkin has grown from it. A fully-grown single stem connects to any [[pumpkin]] in an adjacent square, thus there are 5 possible appearances to a stem. If there are multiple pumpkins it can connect to, it favors the east, then west, north, and south. When the pumpkin is removed, the stem returns to its straight shape.

|From this version up until 14w08a, overgrown pumpkin stems start to draw from the texture below them on <samp>[[blocks-atlas]]</samp>, in much the same way they previously did with terrain.png. However, as texture atlases are unstable and textures tend to change positions as new blocks and textures are added, overgrown stems change the texture they draw from almost every time new textures are added or existing textures are resized.}}
