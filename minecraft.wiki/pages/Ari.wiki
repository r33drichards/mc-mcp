}}'''Ari''' is one of the nine [[Skin#Default skins|default]] skins [[player]]s can use in ''[[Minecraft]]'', and the sixth to be introduced. Introduced alongside several diverse skins, Ari is a common sight in ''Minecraft'' media, helping promote content such as [[Trails & Tales]] and annual events.

== Appearance ==
Ari is typically depicted with wide arms, and peach skin. They bear a strong resemblance to [[Alex]], with a similar tunic (in this case reddish yellow), and long brown braided hair hanging down their right shoulder, as opposed to long red hair hanging down their left shoulder. Their pupils are black with white eyes, and a noticeable blush, whereas their pants are dark turquoise, their belt is brown, and their shoes are gray.

In the [[Character Creator|character creator]], Ari has approximately five unique items.
