A '''farmer''' is a [[villager]] that [[trade]]s crops and natural foods, such as bread and cookies. Farmers wear a straw hat and have a small bag roped around their waist.

== Spawning ==
An unemployed [[villager]] turns into an farmer when an unclaimed [[composter]] is nearby.

=== Natural generation ===
The workstation of farmers, the [[composter]], generates in farms in [[village]]s.

== Drops ==
{{IN|java}}, a farmer can drop various items by throwing them as a gift towards a nearby player with the [[Hero of the Village]] effect. The gift is randomly selected from the following list:
*{{ItemLink|Bread}}
*{{ItemLink|Cookie}}
*{{ItemLink|Pumpkin Pie}}

== Behavior ==
=== Farming ===
[[File:Villagerpickingup.gif|thumb|Farmer villager picking and planting carrots.]]

{{IN|Java}}, during the "work" portion of their schedule, farmers tend nearby crops.

* Farmers sometimes move to random [[farmland]] blocks they detect within ±4 on the X and Z axes and ±2 on the Y axis, rather than going to their job site.
* If there are fully-grown crop blocks or air above farmland within ±1 of the farmer on each axis, the farmer spends 10 seconds tending them (not counting time spent walking to the next block), one per second. The block is harvested if necessary and (re-)planted if the farmer has any plantable crop, crop seed, or flower seed items.
** If {{cmd|/gamerule mobGriefing}} is <code>false</code>, farmers cannot farm.
** Harvesting is done regardless of the farmer's current inventory, even if they lack space to pick up the results.
** Planting takes the item from the first eligible inventory slot, independently of any previously harvested crop type.
* If there is at least one non-fully-grown crop block within ±1 of the farmer on each axis, the farmer has [[bone meal]], and it has been at least 8 seconds since the farmer last did some fertilization, then the farmer fertilizes up to four crop blocks (one every two seconds).
* When the farmer works at their composter, it can perform all of the following tasks in this order in the same work session. The composter always plays the composting sound as the workstation sound, even if nothing is actually put into the composter.
** If the farmer has at most 36 [[bread]] and enough [[wheat]], it crafts up to 3 bread from the available wheat. Any bread that does not fit into the farmer's inventory is dropped as item entity.
** If possible, the farmer extracts a [[bone meal]] item to empty the composter. The item drops as usual and may be picked up separately later.
** If wheat seeds or beetroot seeds are available, the farmer composts excess seeds. Up to 20 total seeds are composted in one work session, but at least 10 of each type of seed are retained. Inventory slots are checked in reverse order. ([[Sniffer]] seeds are never composted.)

{{IN|Bedrock}}, farmers tend crops within the village boundary. Farmers far enough outside the boundary of ''any'' village also tend nearby crops. Farmland to be tended is found by seeking for certain blocks up to 9 blocks away from the farmer in the X and Z coordinates and up to 1 away in the Y coordinate (a 19×19×3 volume total).

* If a farmer does not have enough food in one stack in its inventory (15 bread, 60 carrots, 60 potatoes, 60 beetroots, or 45 wheat) and finds fully-grown wheat, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot, the farmer moves to the crop block and harvests it.
* If a farmer has any seeds, carrots, potatoes, or beetroot seeds in its inventory and finds an air block above farmland, the farmer moves to it and plants a crop. They always plant from the first eligible slot in their inventory.
* Farmers use and pick up [[bone meal]]. They also fill their [[composter]] with [[seeds]].
* Farmers start farming only if a crop is planted on farmland previously. 
* Farmers continue to plant on the farmland even if all crops are destroyed.

For both editions:

* Farmers ''cannot'' turn [[dirt]], [[grass block]]s, or [[dirt path]]s into farmland, nor they pick up any hoes to till the blocks.
** If a hoe is placed into a farmer's mainhand or offhand via commands, they still cannot till any blocks.
