'''Shears''' are a [[tool]] crafted from [[iron ingots]]. They are required to obtain some organic blocks or otherwise mine them faster as well as to shear certain entities and blocks.

== Usage ==
=== Shearing ===
Shears lose 1 [[durability]] when used to shear something.

Shears can be {{Control|used}} on a [[sheep]] to remove its coat and drop 1–3 [[wool]] of the corresponding color. The same sheep can be sheared again after it eats from a [[grass block]] or [[short grass]] to regenerate its coat.

Shearing a [[mooshroom]] drops 5 [[mushroom]]s of the corresponding color and irreversibly turns it into a normal [[cow]].

Shearing a [[snow golem]] irreversibly removes its carved pumpkin, dropping the item and revealing its face.

Shearing a [[bogged]] drops 2 [[mushroom]]s, which can be 2 red mushrooms, 2 brown mushrooms or one of each. 

Shearing a [[copper golem]] with a [[poppy]] planted on it drops the flower.

Shearing either a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]] that is full of honey makes it drop 3 [[honeycomb]]s and resets it to honey level 0. The same beehive or bee nest can be sheared again if it is able to reach full honey again. If sheared by hand without a [[campfire]] or [[soul campfire]] below the hive or nest, all bees within exit and all nearby bees attack the offending player. 

[[Dispenser]]s can use shears in any of the above listed ways, interacting with any valid block or entity in front of the dispenser's face. This decreases the shears' [[durability]]. Durability is only consumed if the shearing action is successful. Failed attempts, such as when a sheep has no wool, do not damage the shears, which can be useful for [[Tutorial:Wool farming|automated wool farms]]. A dispenser shearing a beehive or bee nest does not anger bees or cause them to leave, even if there is not a campfire or soul campfire below it.

Shearing a [[pumpkin]] turns it into a [[carved pumpkin]], dropping 4 [[pumpkin seeds]] {{in|java}} and 1 {{in|bedrock}}. If the pumpkin was attached to a [[pumpkin stem]], the stem detaches. Shearing a correctly positioned pumpkin can [[Carved Pumpkin#Building golems|summon a golem]] as if placing a carved pumpkin.

Shearing the tip of [[cave vines]], [[kelp]], [[weeping vines]], or [[twisting vines]] stops further growth by setting its age value to 25.

==== Removing equipment from mobs ====
Shears can be {{control|used}} on an armored tamed [[wolf]] to remove its [[wolf armor]]. Only the owner of the wolf can remove armor.<ref>{{bug|MC-268781||Can't dispense wolf armor on wolves|WAI}}.</ref>

Shears can be {{control|used}} on a harnessed [[happy ghast]] to remove its [[harness]]. It is not possible to remove the harness from a happy ghast that is currently being ridden.

Shears can be {{ctrl|used}} to remove [[saddle]]s, [[horse armor]] and [[carpet]]s from mobs wearing them. This is the only way to remove the saddle from a [[pig]] or [[strider]] without killing the mob. It is not possible to remove equipment from a mob that is currently being ridden or to remove the saddle from a [[ravager]].

=== Breaking blocks ===
Shears use 1 [[durability]] when they are used to break any block (except [[fire]] and [[soul fire]]).

Shears can be used to harvest [[cobweb]]s, [[leaves]], [[short grass]], [[short dry grass]], [[tall dry grass]], [[seagrass]], [[fern]]s, [[bush]]es, [[dead bush]]es, [[nether sprouts]], [[small dripleaves]], [[vines]], [[glow lichen]] or [[hanging roots]] and obtain them in item form. If used to break [[tall grass]], [[tall seagrass]] or [[large fern]]s, 2 units of the respective small plant are dropped instead.

When shears are used to break [[weeping vines]] or [[twisting vines]] they are guaranteed to drop in item form instead of the usual 33% chance. This applies to vines directly broken by shears and not vines that are broken due to the destruction of their supporting vines.

Shears can also be used to break [[tripwire]] connected to a [[tripwire hook]] without activating it. Additionally, shears can be used to break [[wool]] faster than other tools.

The following table shows information about blocks that can be broken with shears. Colors indicate what gets dropped when the block is broken:

* White on light mode, gray on dark mode: The original block.
* Blue: The block's normal drop (i.e. string, sticks, seeds, saplings, apples).
* Yellow: two units of the corresponding small plant (short grass, seagrass, or ferns)
* Red: Nothing.
