'''GNU Unifont''' (referred to {{in|JE}} as '''uniform''') is a [[font]] used by ''Minecraft'', primarily as a fallback option for when characters are not defined in the [[Mojangles|default game font]].

== Definition ==
This is a fallback font to support characters not defined in [[Mojangles]], such as CJK and Tamil characters. When the "Force Unicode Font" option in [[Options#Font_Settings|Font Settings]] is ON {{in|java}}, it is the only font used by default.

It references {{cd|unifont.zip}}.

The .json file with the pointer to the [[Tutorial:Sound directory#Locating specific sound files|location of {{cd|minecraft/font/unifont.zip}} in {{cd|.minecraft/assets/objects}}]] is located at {{cd|.minecraft/assets/indexes/5.json}}, or a higher numbered .json file, like <code>/25.json</code>.

Also located in the same file is the pointer the location of <code>minecraft/font/unifont_jp.zip</code>.

== Supported characters ==
; {{cd|unifont.zip}}

This contains the "unihex" characters. Inside of it are 2 files: a copy of the [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html GNU General Public License version 2], and {{mono|unifont_all_no_pua-16.0.03.hex}}. The latter file is a copy of GNU Unifont 16.0.03 and contains glyph definitions for 114,398 characters.
