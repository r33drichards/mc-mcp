A '''golden spear''' is a variant of [[spear]] crafted from [[gold ingot]]s. It can be used to perform slow jab attacks or held forward to deal increasing [[damage]] based on how quickly the wielder is moving. It is the seventh-highest [[tier]] of spear, dealing the same damage as a [[wooden spear]] but with lower attack speed and durability. It can be [[Piglin#Piglin loved items|admired]] by piglins, and has the highest [[enchantability]].

=== Mob loot ===
[[Piglin]]s and [[zombified piglin]]s have a 5% chance to spawn with golden spears, and those holding one have an 8.5% chance (+1% for each level of [[Looting]], up to a maximum of 11.5% with Looting III) to drop it when killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]].

== Usage ==
=== Attacking ===
==== Jab attack ====
A golden spear can be {{control|attack|text=used}} while standing on the ground to perform a jab attack, dealing damage, and afterwards entering a recharge cooldown similar to that of an ender pearl or chorus fruit on Bedrock Edition, or a version of the normal attack cooldown on Java Edition.

==== Charge attack ====
When holding down the {{control|attack|text=use}} key, the spear is lowered into an attack position, where colliding with a target deals damage depending on the velocity of the user, and the attack dismounts attacked targets from their mounts. After being held out for too long, the charge attack goes into a shaking state where attacks no longer dismount targets from their mounts. After even longer, the charge attack goes into a dropped down state where attacks no longer deal [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]], but still deal full damage.

=== Piglins ===
[[Piglin]]s are attracted to golden spears and run toward any golden spear on the ground, inspecting it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.
