A '''wooden sword''' is an early-game variant of [[sword]] crafted from [[planks]]. It is the sixth-highest [[tier]] of sword, dealing the same damage as a [[golden sword]] but having more durability. It can be used as [[fuel]] in a [[furnace]], [[smoker]], or [[blast furnace]].

== Obtaining ==
Wooden swords are crafted with two [[planks]] of any kind and one [[stick]]. 

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
  |B1 = Any Planks
  |B2 = Any Planks
  |B3 = Stick
  |Output = Wooden Sword
  |type = Combat
}}

== Usage ==
=== Breaking ===
{{main|Sword#Breaking}}

A wooden sword can also be used to destroy some blocks quicker than with fists. All swords have the same mining speed, so the wooden sword is just as useful for breaking blocks as any other sword.

If an wooden sword is enchanted with [[Silk Touch]], either using [[Creative]] or [[commands]], it can be used to obtain a cobweb as an item by breaking it.

=== Attacking ===
{{Main|Sword#Attacking}}
Pressing {{control|attack}} while holding a wooden sword deals damage to the entity the player is looking at. This reduces the durability of the wooden sword by 1.

=== Damage ===
{{Main|Damage}}

==== ''Java Edition'' ====
Wooden swords have an attack speed of 1.6 and take {{convert|12|game tick|second}} to [[Damage#Attack cooldown|recover]].

=== Repairing ===

==== Anvil repair ====
{{main|Anvil mechanics#Unit repair}}
{{Repairing
| head=1
| Damaged Wooden Sword
| Damaged Wooden Sword; Any Planks
| Wooden Sword
| tail=1
}}

A wooden sword can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[wood planks]] of any kind, with each repair material restoring 25% the sword's maximum durability, rounded down. Two wooden swords can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the sword's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
{{Main|Sword#Enchantments}}
The wooden sword can receive all the same [[enchantment]]s as any other sword.

=== Fuel ===
Wooden swords can be used as fuel in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1 item per sword.

== Sounds ==
{{main|Sword#Sounds}}
<!--Please don't add the sound tables. They belong on the future sword overview page anyways.-->
Wooden swords make a sound when used to attack an [[entity]]. The sound depends on how the attack is landed. All sounds are the same as every other sword.

== Trivia ==
*The wooden sword's traditional (first) [[texture]] came from [[Notch]]'s abandoned RPG, ''[[Legend of the Chambered]]''. The [[iron sword]]'s texture was created first, as it was from the game, and the rest of the swords, including the wooden sword, followed.
