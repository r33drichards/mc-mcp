'''A Tale of Two Friends''' is a comedic short film presented at [[Minecraft Live 2023]], exploring the adventures of a [[camel]] as it tries to protect a [[snifflet]] found by [[Efe]].  

== Summary ==
A snifflet hatches in a camp used by Efe during the middle of the night, waking up Efe's camel in the process. The camel tries to keep the snifflet from wandering off, but is bound by a [[leash]] while the snifflet approaches a [[river]]. Breaking off, the camel rushes over to save it, only for the snifflet to leap backwards into it. The camel rushes over to save it, only to realize it's just a single block down in front of the river, getting caught up in the stream itself. Getting itself out, the camel realizes the snifflet has walked into a pack of various [[monster]]s. The snifflet walks right through, the monsters not recognizing it and shrugging it off. The camel is beaten to a pulp.

The snifflet next finds itself in a [[minecart]], receding into a [[cave]]. The camel tries to catch up, but falls running down the tracks into a [[Dripstone Caves|dripstone cave]] below the [[mineshaft]]. Climbing back up, the camel finds itself in a [[desert]], and realizes the snifflet is missing; it has now wandered through a [[Nether portal]]. The camel is now getting irritated, but follows through nonetheless, finding itself on a [[blackstone]] structure on top of the [[Lava ocean|ocean]]. Somehow, the snifflet is now on top of a [[ghast]], gently being carried up to a cliff. The camel follows by jumping across various [[Strider|striders]], but falls into the [[lava]]. Meanwhile, the snifflet wanders into a [[Warped Forest|warped forest]], where another [[Ruined Portal|ruined portal]] lies. Before the camel can follow through that portal, it has to run away from a ghast's [[fireball]], which propels it into a [[jungle]].

As the [[sun]] begins to rise, the camel realizes Efe is going to notice two pets missing, and decides to return back to the camp alone. After going through every previous obstacle again, the camel returns to the camp defeated and covered in [[Arrow|arrows]]. Efe awakens gracefully, mystified by the now vacant [[Moss Block|moss block]] where the [[Sniffer Egg|sniffer egg]] sat. To their surprise, the snifflet has returned as well, and sniffs the camel, before walking up to Efe and dropping [[Torchflower Seeds|torchflower seeds]]. Efe and the camel are overjoyed, the latter running around them and plays with its new snifflet friend.
