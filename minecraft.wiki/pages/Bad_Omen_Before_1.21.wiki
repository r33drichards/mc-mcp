Prior to the [[Tricky Trials]] update, '''Bad Omen''' was a [[status effect]] that caused a raid when an affected player entered a [[village]].

== Effect ==
Bad Omen could be obtained by killing an illager captain.

If a player entered a village with Bad Omen, a [[raid]] was triggered. The enchantment level of the incoming raiders' equipment was increased depending on the level of the omen, and the resulting [[Hero of the Village]] effect matched the level of the omen, if all raiders had been defeated with villagers still alive.

[[File:BadOmenInventory.png|thumb|The status effect showing up on the player's inventory.]]
Bad Omen's potency determined the chance for [[illager]]s to be equipped with enchanted weapons when the player triggered a [[raid]] by entering a certain radius around a villager-claimed POI ([[bed]], [[job site]], or [[bell]]). If the raid resulted in player victory, the [[Hero of the Village]]'s potency equaled the Bad Omen's potency (capped at level 5). Bad Omen levels past the first also gave a single extra raid wave, given the [[difficulty]] level. For example, with Bad Omen II-V in Easy difficulty raid had four waves instead of three, Normal difficulty had six waves instead of five, and Hard difficulty had eight waves instead of seven.{{only|java|short=1}}

As a [[status effect]], Bad Omen could be removed through all conventional methods, such as drinking [[milk]] or dying.

The player could still receive the Bad Omen effect in Peaceful difficulty via commands (all pillager captains despawn in Peaceful), but it did not trigger a raid.

== Trivia ==
*If the player leaved a village during a raid, received Bad Omen, and returned to the village, the effect was removed but did not affect the existing raid.
*A player could not receive Bad Omen when indirectly killing a patrol captain. This included burning with [[fire]] or [[lava]], Thorns damage, [[drowning]], [[explosion]]s, and [[suffocation]], among other things. This also included killing a captain with [[firework]]s shot from a [[crossbow]].
*If the player killed a captain while in a [[village]] {{in|Bedrock}}, the raid bar and Bad Omen effect appeared simultaneously. The effect disappeared immediately after, then "flashes" again approximately 1 second later.
