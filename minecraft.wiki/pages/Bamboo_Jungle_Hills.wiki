The '''bamboo jungle hills''' biome was a hills variant of the [[bamboo jungle]] biome that no longer generates as of [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
The bamboo jungle hills was similar to the bamboo jungle, though with steeper terrain like the regular [[Jungle Hills|jungle hills]]. Large amounts of bamboo covered the landscape, and patches of [[podzol]] replaced most [[grass block]]s. Naturally-generated [[tree]]s were always large variants, and pandas spawned here, like in the bamboo jungle. [[Jungle pyramid]]s also generated here {{in|je}}.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], bamboo jungle hills use a strong humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which fades the distance in an orange tint. Bamboo jungle hills have warm atmospherics, lighting, and color grading, which makes the biome look more humid and warm.

== Mobs ==
{{IN|Java}}, bamboo jungle hills used the same mob spawning chances as jungle hills for hostile and ambient categories, and had different chances for passive categories.

The following mobs naturally spawned here:

{{Spawn table
|passive=
{{Spawn row|Sheep|weight=12|size=4}}
{{Spawn row|Pig|weight=10|size=4}}
{{Spawn row|Chicken|weight=10|size=4}}
{{Spawn row|Cow|weight=8|size=4}}
{{Spawn row|Parrot|weight=10|size=1}}
