[[File:Sprinting Steve.png|right|200px]]
'''Sprinting''' is a method of [[transportation]] that allows the [[player]] to move faster, at the expense of depleting [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]]. While sprinting, the player's field of view expands slightly. Players who attack while sprinting deal a [[sprint-knockback]] attack, inflicting additional [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]] and canceling the sprint.

== Activating ==
To sprint, the player can press {{control|sprint}} while moving, or double tap {{control|forward}}. The player cannot sprint if their [[hunger|hunger bar]] is at {{hunger|6}} or below, or when they are under the [[Blindness]] effect.

Hostile mobs that can sprint:
* {{EntityLink|Evoker}}
* {{EntityLink|Hoglin}}
* {{EntityLink|Illusioner}}{{only|java|short=1}}
* {{EntityLink|Pillager}}
* {{EntityLink|Vindicator}}
* {{EntityLink|Witch}}
* {{EntityLink|Wither Skeleton}}
* {{EntityLink|Zoglin}}

Neutral mobs that can sprint:
* {{EntityLink|Enderman}}
* {{EntityLink|Fox}}
* {{EntityLink|Iron Golem}}

Passive mobs that can sprint:
* {{EntityLink|Cat}}
* {{EntityLink|Camel}} 
* {{EntityLink|Camel Husk}}
* {{EntityLink|Ocelot}}
* {{EntityLink|Villager}}
* {{EntityLink|Wandering Trader}}

== Usage ==
[[File:sprinting_anim.gif|thumb|right|Particles coming out of the ground while sprinting.]]
Sprinting allows the player to move at around 5.612&nbsp;meters/second, which is 30 percent faster than the normal walking speed of around 4.317&nbsp;m/s, [[jumping]] while sprinting allows the player to move with an average speed of 7.127&nbsp;m/s. The player can turn while sprinting, resulting in slightly reduced speed. Sprinting also increases the speed of [[flying]] in [[Creative]] mode, and the speed of [[swimming]]. Although "sprinting" while mounted on a [[minecart]], [[boat]], [[horse]], [[pig]], or [[strider]] increases the field of vision like actual sprinting, it does not increase the entity's speed. Sprinting and jumping while under a 2-block high ceiling causes a player to move at a speed almost twice as fast as regular sprinting speed, but it consumes a hunger point per second, and these rates increase if the ceiling height is further decreased with [[trapdoor]]s. A similar effect occurs if the player sprints and rapidly hits {{control|jump}} at the same time on a set of stairs.

While sprinting, it is possible to jump across up to four [[block]]s horizontally,<ref>{{ytl|cPWyGGA0mLk|Length of Sprint Jump in Minecraft Beta 1.8|Minecraft|September 2, 2011}}</ref> instead of the usual two blocks, although sprinting does not cause the player to jump higher. Jumping out of a 2-block high ceiling increases the jump reach to five blocks.

Sprinting reduces the player's [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]]. When saturation reaches zero, the [[hunger bar]] depletes at a rate of {{frac|1|2}} every 40 meters, or 7 seconds.

Sprinting produces particles at the player's feet corresponding to the block type they are running on. Sprinting and holding down jump at the same time is usually faster, but actually becomes slower when under the effect of [[Speed]] II or higher.

Sprinting ends when the player collides with a solid block at an angle of greater than 8 degrees<ref group="note">In the Bedrock version, there is a short window of time in which the player can move away from the solid block in order to continue sprinting. In the Java version, sprinting ends immediately upon colliding.</ref>, [[Blocking|blocks]], or attacks a mob. Sprinting also ends if the hunger bar reduces to {{hunger|6}} or less.

Sprinting pauses when the player eats [[food]] or drinks [[potion]]s, but pressing {{control|sprint}} while eating food or potions does not start sprinting.

=== Sprint-knockback attack ===
{{main|Knockback (mechanic)}}
Players who attack while sprinting deal a [[sprint-knockback]] attack, inflicting additional [[Knockback (mechanic)|knockback]] and canceling the sprint.

== Videos ==
{{video note|Sprint keys were added in [[Java Edition 1.7.2]]. Also, the video does not mention that sprinting automatically stops after 30 seconds (although that has since been removed).}}

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Sprint-jumping actually costs less [[Hunger#Exhaustion level increase|exhaustion]] per block travelled compared to pure sprinting, despite being faster. This is because exhaustion increases while the player is on the ground. While sprint-jumping, most of the distance is covered in mid-air.
