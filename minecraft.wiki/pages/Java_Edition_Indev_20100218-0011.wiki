== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File: Oak Leaves JE2.png|32px]] [[Leaves]]'''
* Leaves ''don't'' decay if:
** They are on top of a solid block.
** They are on top of a leaf block.
** There is a log within a 5×5×2 box around the leaf. (Note that the leaf does not have to touch the log.)
* If any of these conditions are not met, the leaf decays.

'''[[File: Water JE6.png|32px]] [[Water]]'''
* Still water is no longer lighter than flowing water.

=== Items ===
'''{{Animate|Chainmail Armor JE1 BE1.png; Diamond Armor JE1 BE1.png; Golden Armor JE1 BE1.png; Iron Armor JE1 BE1.png; Leather Armor JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Armor]]'''
* Now has durability based on the material.
* Is now fully functional.

'''[[File:Arrow (item) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Arrow]]s'''
* Now bounce off the player on Peaceful difficulty instead of dealing ghost damage.

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* If an entity is missing its {{nbt|short|Health}} tag, now they set it to 10 health points by default.

'''[[File:Skeleton JE1.png|32px]] [[Skeleton]]s'''
* Tweaked chances of catching on [[fire]] while in [[sunlight]].
** Now burned only when the sunlight level is greater than 7, and not due to torches at night.

'''[[File:Zombie JE1.png|32px]] [[Zombie]]s'''
* Tweaked chances of catching on [[fire]] while in [[sunlight]].
** Now burned only when the sunlight level is greater than 7, and not due to torches at night.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Only armor items can now be placed in the slots next to the player miniature.
* [[File:Empty Armor Slot Helmet.png|32px]] [[File:Empty Armor Slot Chestplate.png|32px]] [[File:Empty Armor Slot Leggings.png|32px]] [[File:Empty Armor Slot Boots.png|32px]] Added empty armor icons to the inventory.
** Previously they were unused sprites in {{mono|[[items.png]]}}.
* Armor slots are now stored in slots 100, 101, 102 and 103 in the save file, instead of slots 36, 37, 38 and 39.
** This means that items placed in these slots in older world are lost after loading level starting from this version.

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* Entities no longer produce step sounds when moving above liquids.
* Players' health saves now. Reloading a save no longer makes the player have full health again.

== Bugs ==
'''1 bug reported'''
* Lava now deals {{Health|1}} damage per hit instead of {{Health|10}} to players.
** This is caused by the addition of an additional invincibility time to players, which causes them to not receive damage from lava since it also took damage from burning on the same tick.
** This bug remained in the game until [[Java Edition Alpha v1.2.2|Alpha v1.2.2]].
