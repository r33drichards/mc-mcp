[[File:List of Java Edition snapshots.png|thumb|A list of snapshots per year.]]

A '''snapshot''' is the term used to describe development versions for {{JE}} updates. Every major update, and many minor updates, have snapshots released roughly weekly for player feedback on in-development features and changes.

== Purpose ==
Snapshots are unstable development versions for updates, which focus on adding features and new content to the game. Once an update is feature complete, the update cycle moves from the snapshot phase to the [[pre-release]] phase.

== Availability ==
Snapshots are available in the ''[[Minecraft Launcher]]'' under the default "Latest snapshot" profile.

{{For|instructions on how to install a snapshot|Tutorial:Installing a version}}

== Naming ==
Current snapshots are named using the scheme '''''VersionNumber'' Snapshot ''SnapshotNumber'''''. For example, the first snapshot for version 26.1 is [[26.1 Snapshot 1]].<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-new-version-numbering-system|Minecraft’s new version numbering system|December 2, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-26-1-snapshot-1|Minecraft 26.1 Snapshot 1|December 16, 2025}}</ref>

Before 2026, snapshots used a unique naming format, unrelated to the 1.''x'' version numbering used elsewhere. Snapshots used the format "'''''YY''w''WWn'''''". '''''YY''''' was the two-digit year, "'''w'''" simply standed for "week", '''''WW''''' was the two-digit week number within the year, and '''''n''''' was a unique letter identifier – starting with "'''a'''", then "'''b'''", and so on – which incremented when there was more than one release in a given week. For example, [[18w10d]] was the fourth snapshot ("'''d'''") released in the '''10'''th '''w'''eek of 20'''18'''. The highest letter reached is "'''e'''", a tie between [[12w30e]], [[13w47e]] and [[15w35e]]. The naming convention was only broken by [[13w12~]] and April Fools' snapshots.

== Release schedule ==
Modern snapshots are set to be released on Tuesdays.<ref>{{tweet|gnembon_mc|1907558244685373483|Yes, snapshots are moving to Tuesdays.|April 2, 2025}}</ref> Prior to [[Minecraft LIVE - March 2025]], they were released on Wednesdays, barring delays.<ref>{{snap|24w20a}}</ref> The day had been Thursday until the release of [[14w25a]] on June 18, 2014, in the middle of development for [[Java Edition 1.8|1.8]].<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|481369603281809408|The Minecraft weekly snapshots will no longer have their regular debuts on Thursdays, we are moving them to Wednesdays starting this week.|June 24, 2014}}</ref><ref name="mojang">{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624075744/https://mojang.com/2014/06/minecraft-snapshot-14w26a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w26c|date=June 25, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]|quote=Wednesday is the new Thursday!

[[April Fools' Day jokes|April Fools' Day snapshots]] can be released on any day of the week, depending on what day April 1st falls on.
