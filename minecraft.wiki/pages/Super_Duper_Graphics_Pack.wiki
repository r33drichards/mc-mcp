The pack was intended to add dynamic shadows, lighting that streams through fog, movement in leaves, grass and other foliage, new textures for blocks, items, mobs and villagers, directional lighting, edge highlighting, specular maps, additional 3D geometry, emissive maps, tone mapping, dynamic exposure, increased draw distance, parallax occlusion mapping, and other graphical improvements. It would have cost around [[w:United States dollar|US$]]10.00.<ref name="sdgp" />
