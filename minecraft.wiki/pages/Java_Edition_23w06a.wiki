'''23w06a''' is the fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.19.4]], released on February 8, 2023,<ref>{{snap|23w06a|February 8, 2023}}</ref> which introduces [[display]] entities, {{cmd|damage}} command, damage types and [[tag]]s, and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Display]] entities'''
* Including block display, item display, and text display.
** Like [[marker]]s, don't tick and have no collisions or physics.
** Models render at entity position, with normal rotation around X and Y axis (so it can be controlled by teleport commands), but also with additional arbitrary model transform.
* 2 new data types added, each of them has 2 forms, but only one for saving, as following:
** <code>rotation</code>
*** Quaternion form (used for saving): array of 4 numbers, describing components (x, y, z, w).
*** Axis-angle form: object with following fields:
**** <code>axis</code>: 3D vector.
**** <code>angle</code>: Angle in radians.
** <code>transformation</code>: Arbitrary affine transform, composed as following fields and following order:
*** Matrix form: array of 16 numbers, describing row-major matrix.
*** Decomposed form (used for saving): object with following fields:
**** <code>translation</code>: 3D vector.
**** <code>left_rotation</code>: <code>rotation</code> object.
**** <code>scale</code>: 3D vector.
**** <code>right_rotation</code>: <code>rotation</code> object.
* Some properties of display entities can be interpolated, to create gradual changes over time for clients, instead of instantaneous jumps.
** Display entities keep track of current and previous values of interpolated values:
*** All properties marked as "interpolated" are part of a single interpolation set.
*** Any update to interpolated property cause all values of interpolation set to be saved as "current".
**** Data command executions that do not change value of property (even if it's present in NBT) do not count as updates.
**** Updates are synchronized to clients at most once per tick, so multiple updates within command still count as single update.
*** Previous current values are saved as "previous".
*** If interpolation is enabled, entity transitions between "previous" and "current" values over time.
*** Start of interpolation (entity fully in "previous" state) is defined by field <code>interpolation_start</code> (game time, in ticks).
**** Set to -1 to load current game time instead.
*** End of interpolation (entity fully in "current" state) is defined as <code>interpolation_start</code> + <code>interpolation_duration</code> (in ticks).
* Every entity in family has the following fields:
** <code>transformation</code>: transformation applied to model (after normal entity orientation). Defaults to identity. Interpolated.
** <code>billboard</code>: option to control if entity should pivot to face player when rendered:
*** <code>fixed</code>: No rotation (default).
*** <code>vertical</code>: Entity can pivot around vertical axis.
*** <code>horizontal</code>: Entity can pivot around horizontal axis.
*** <code>center</code>: Entity can pivot around center point.
** <code>brightness</code>: If present, overrides light values used for rendering. Omitted by default (which means rendering uses values from entity position). Object has two fields:
*** <code>sky</code>: Value of skylight, from 0 to 15.
*** <code>block</code>: Value of block light, from 0 to 15.
** <code>view_range</code>: Maximum view range of this entity. Actual distance depends on client-side render distance and entity distance scalling. Default value 1.0 (roughly the same as fireball).
** <code>shadow_radius</code>: Size of shadow. Defaults to 0 (no shadow). Interpolated.
** <code>shadow_strength</code>: Strength of the shadow. Controls the opacity of the shadow as a function of distance to block below. Defaults to 1. Interpolated.
** <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>: Describe size of culling bounding box. Bounding box spans vertically <code>y</code> to <code>y+height</code> and horizontally <code>width/2</code> in all directions from entity position. If either field is set to 0, culling is disabled. Both default to 0.
** <code>glow_color_override</code>: Override glow border color. Defaults to 0 (use team color).
* Besides common fields, these entity types also have some exclusive fields for their different usages:
** Item display (<code>item_display</code>): Displays a single item stack (stack can be changed with commands by setting slot <code>inventory.0</code>).
*** <code>item</code>: Item stack to display. Same format as in inventory.
**** Example: <code>{id: "minecraft:dirt", Count: 1}</code>
*** <code>item_display</code>: Describes item model transform applied to item (as defined in <code>display</code> section in model JSON)
**** Values: <code>none</code> (default), {{cd|d=,|thirdperson_lefthand|thirdperson_righthand|firstperson_lefthand|firstperson_righthand|head|gui|ground|fixed}}.
** Block display (<code>block_display</code>): Displays a block state, does not display block entities, even if they would normally be created on block placement (like [[chest]]).
*** <code>block_state</code>: Block state to display. Same format as item held by [[endermen]].
**** Example: <code>{Name:"minecraft:dirt"}</code>.
** Text display (<code>text_display</code>): Displays a text component (backgrounds uses new shader types <code>rendertype_text_background</code> and <code>rendertype_text_background_see_through</code>).
*** <code>text</code>: Text to display. Components are resolved with the context of the display entity.
*** <code>line_width</code>: Line width used to split lines (note: new line can be also added with <code>\n</code> characters). Defaults to 200.
*** <code>text_opacity</code>: Opacity (alpha component) of rendered text. Defaults to 255. Interpolated.
*** <code>background</code>: Color of background. Includes alpha channel. Defaults to 0x40000000. Interpolated.
*** <code>default_background</code>: If true, rendering uses default text background color (same as in chat). Defaults to false.
*** <code>shadow</code>: Should text be displayed with shadow. Defaults to false.
*** <code>see_through</code>: Should text be visible through blocks. Defaults to false.
*** <code>alignment</code>: How text should be aligned.
**** Values: <code>center</code> (default), <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Game rule]]'''
* Added <code>doVinesSpread</code>.
** Defaults to <code>true</code>.
** Determines if [[vines]] spread to nearby blocks.
** Does not affect [[cave vines]], [[twisting vines]] and [[weeping vines]].

'''{{cmd|damage}}'''
* A new command to apply damage to entities, with following syntaxes:
** {{cmd|link=none|damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [at <location>]}}
** {{cmd|link=none|damage <target> <amount> [<damageType>] [by <entity>] [from <cause>]}}
* Parameters:
** <code>target</code>: The entity to damage.
** <code>amount</code>: Amount of damage to inflict.
** <code>damageType</code>: The type of damage to inflict.
*** This determines how the damage affects the entity as well as which [[death message]] is displayed.
** <code>location</code>: The location the damage originated at (when no entity caused the damage).
*** For instance, it might represent the location of a [[bed]] exploding in [[the Nether]].
** <code>entity</code>: The entity inflicting the damage.
** <code>cause</code>: The cause of the damage, in the case of indirect damage.
*** Example: When shot by an arrow, the <code>entity</code> is the [[arrow]] projectile while <code>cause</code> might be a [[skeleton]].

'''{{cmd|execute}}'''
* Added {{cmd|link=none|execute summon}} sub-command, with the following syntax:
** {{cmd|link=none|execute summon <entity> -> execute}}
* This sub-command is for summoning new entity and binding context (<code>@s</code>) to it. Meant to simplify entity setup and reduce need for raw NBT editing.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]'''
* Added [[damage type]]s, which are a new registry.
** Determines how damage is handled by the game.
** Includes which attributes the damage has as well as which death message is used when an entity dies due to that type of damage, example: <syntaxhighlight lang="json">
{
	"exhaustion": 0.1,
 	"message_id": "arrow",
	"scaling": "when_caused_by_living_non_player"
}</syntaxhighlight>
** Fields:
*** <code>message_id</code>: The message id used for deaths caused by this damage type.
**** Combined with other string fragments to form a translation key.
*** <code>exhaustion</code>: The amount of hunger [[exhaustion]] caused by this damage type.
*** <code>scaling</code>: Whether this damage type scales with difficulty levels. Possible values:
**** <code>never</code>: Damage is always the same.
**** <code>always</code>: Damage always scales with difficulty.
**** <code>when_caused_by_living_non_player</code>: Damage scales with difficulty if it was caused by a living entity who is not a player.
*** <code>effects</code>: Optional field controlling how damage manifests when inflicted on players. Possible values:
**** <code>hurt</code> (default): The default hurt sound.
**** <code>thorns</code>: Thorns hurt sound.
**** <code>drowning</code>: Drowning sound.
**** <code>burning</code>: A single tick of burning sound.
**** <code>poking</code>: Berry bush poke sound.
**** <code>freezing</code>: Freeze tick sound.
*** <code>death_message_type</code>: Optional field that controls if special death message variants are used. Possible values:
**** <code>default</code> (default): No special death message logic is applied.
**** <code>fall_variants</code>: Show a variant of fall damage death instead of a regular death message, e.g. <code>death.fell.assist.item</code>.
**** <code>intentional_game_design</code>: Show the intentional game design message instead of a regular death message.
** Damage type [[tag]]s control many aspects of how damage from different sources are interpreted.
