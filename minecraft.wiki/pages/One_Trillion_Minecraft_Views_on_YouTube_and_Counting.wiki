'''One Trillion Minecraft Views on YouTube and Counting''' is a collaboration between the video sharing platform {{Wikipedia|YouTube}}, [[Spark Universe]]<ref>https://sparkuniverse.com/project/one-trillion-views</ref>, and ''[[Minecraft]]'' celebrating one trillion views of ''Minecraft'' videos on the platform, featuring various references to the ''Minecraft'' community. It was uploaded to the official YouTube channel on December 14, 2021 and has since been delisted.<ref>{{Cite|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215041724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXY74kWderc|title=One Trillion Minecraft Views on YouTube and Counting|website=YouTube|author=YouTube|date=December 14, 2021}}</ref>

The video features a cover version of the popular single ''{{W|We Built This City}}'' by American rock band {{W|Starship (band)|Starship}} with altered, ''Minecraft'' related lyrics.

== Summary ==
The video starts on a rising counter accumulating to one trillion with the YouTube logo. Then, the camera pans down to a red-cloaked wandering trader and llama, signaling the iconic YouTube red. Two predominantly blue and orange players clamber on the side of grass blocks looking towards for aforementioned entities.

It cuts towards the trader with it hastily tracking side to side with its eyes as red, cuboid-shaped shulker box is placed down. A glowing red light sources emerges from inside and the top half rises with a unique music disc.

The predominantly blue player grabs hold of the floating, red disc and inserts it in the jukebox, cueing the music. Motifs of "We built this city" is played throughout the video.

The video cuts to be more zoomed out as a red beacon glow is placed on top of the mountain from the music disc as two YouTubers, Preston and Briana in the Minecraft skins look towards it.

The predominantly blue player then uses a spyglass to watch a crowd of people and entitles to literally build a city. Renowned YouTubers work together to build their first structure: an enderdragon statue with the pedestal stating "<u>1,000,000,000,000</u>."

A ginormous slime, flying machine from a video by Mumbo Jumbo is shown.<ref name="mumbo_walking_house">{{YouTube link|yhtGo8XkUT4|I made a Walking House in Minecraft 1.14|Mumbo Jumbo|June 11, 2019}}</ref> The machine is called a "walking house" in Mumbo's video, and is piloted by him and Grian in this video. Afterwards, Grian sings the line "We built this city." Then, a wide shot is presented with the identical redstone surrounded by players, either building colosseums or riding the machines.

Aphmau is then presented running between the legs of the redstone machine with her pet dog as she sings "Wolves and bones!" and throws the bone into the air with her pet leaping towards it.

The next scene transitioned into [[Villager News]], with [[Villager No. 5]] singing along. During this segment, an image of 3 players holding blocks, a wolf leaping and a ship is shown with the caption of "PEOPLE BUILD CITY."

Introduced to a circling shot of Jerome firing a bow and arrow in the middle of a desert, he shoots a player who then grabs onto the chest. Jerome, seconds later, body charges the player out of the way to open the chest, with the lid covering most of the screen.

During the transition, it shows Dream hooking to a strider in the Nether, (referencing his "Manhunt video") as he enters through a nether portal on top of lava, displaying an immediate changeover to the Overworld.

Three "derp" faces show one building on the left, one tilling on the right, and the centre digging straight down with a golden pickaxe. This features lucky blocks from [[mod]]s and eventually falling straight into a cave with lava.

This blacks out into a Fallen Kingdom scene as the king transitions into the iconic dropper map with PewDiePie.
