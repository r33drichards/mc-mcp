It is based on [[Java Edition 1.2.5]].

0.982 was reuploaded on July 25, 2012, to change the logo, main menu, position of buttons, add WorldEdit, add new skins, and more.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
* Added WorldEdit plugin & support for it. 
* All skins improved, 8 new skins!
* Added custom keybindings menu for menus and commands.
* Added serverside custom texturepack support.
* Added helpful Information box to the server.
* Greatly improved performance.
* Tweaks and fixes.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''Main menu'''
* Changed logo from [[File:MinecraftEdu logo 3.png|width=133x133]] to [[File:MinecraftEdu logo 4.png|width=133x133]].
* New logo style changed so as to not confuse the logo with ''[[Java Edition]]''.
* "Back to start menu" button moved from bottom left.
* Added transparency behind buttons.
* Now the text of the version on the main menu screen is across the top, instead of the top left corner.
