'''Chiseled purpur''' is an unobtainable block in the [[purpur]] family, which looks identical to standard [[purpur block]]s.

== Obtaining ==
This block is not normally obtainable, and commands are therefore required; e.g. {{cmd|give @s purpur_block 1 1}}

=== Breaking ===
Chiseled purpur be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Chiseled Purpur|Pickaxe|Wood}}

== Usage ==
Chiseled purpur can be used as a construction material much like regular purpur blocks.

=== Note Blocks ===
Chiseled purpur can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass drum" sounds.
