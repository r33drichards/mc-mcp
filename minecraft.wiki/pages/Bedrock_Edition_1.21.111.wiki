'''[[API]]'''
:{{cd|@minecraft/server}}
* Added {{cd|@minecraft/server}} version {{cd|2.3.0-beta}}.

'''[[Biome]]s'''
* Added content errors in server side biome components that were missing them to more easily identify issues and how to fix them.
* Pre Caves and Cliffs components {{cd|minecraft:overworld_generation_rules}} and {{cd|minecraft:multinoise_generation_rules}} do nothing with biome generation and will return a content error when used in custom biomes.
* Custom biomes are now out of experimental.
* Added {{cd|underwater_music}} parameter to {{cd|minecraft:biome_music}} client biome component that enables the underwater music for the biome.
* Added {{cd|max_puddle_depth_below_sea_level}} to the {{cd|surface_builder}} biome component for the swamp builder type. The component will set the search depth for how far below sea level to search for a surface to add a puddle.
* Removed support for loading custom biomes for base game versions 1.21.100 and below.
* Removed the 1.20.60 format version for server side biome JSON files. All server side biome JSON files should be version 1.21.110 or higher.
* Updated the server side biome file format version to be 1.21.110.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* Custom block geometry no longer produces a warning when fully contained within the first or last 1/16ths of the unit cube volume in any axis.
** A warning is still produced if the geometry doesn't have at least one corner overlapping the unit cube volume, not counting its boundary.
* Added {{cd|mossy_stone_brick_double_slab}}, {{cd|smooth_quartz_double_slab}}, {{cd|normal_stone_double_slab}}, {{cd|cut_sandstone_double_slab}}, and {{cd|cut_red_sandstone_double_slab}} definitions to {{cd|blocks.json}}.

** Y axis is more accurate to exactly where the biome is.

'''Components'''
* Content warnings will log missing references in {{cd|Jigsaw Structure}}, {{cd|Processor List}}, {{cd|Template Pool}}, and {{cd|Structure Sets}} JSON.
* Content warnings will log missing references in {{cd|Camera Preset}}, {{cd|Camera List}}, {{cd|Aim Assist Preset}}, and {{cd|Aim Assist Categories}} JSON.
* Content warnings will log missing item references in {{cd|Crafting Items Catalog}} JSON.
* Changes to {{cd|minecraft:input_air_controlled}}.
** Renamed to {{cd|minecraft:free_camera_controlled}}.
** Removed upward movement behavior when holding the jump action from this component.
* Added new component {{cd|minecraft:vertical_movement_action}}.
** Adds the functionality of upward or downward movement when holding the jump action.
** This component is automatically added to any entity that uses the old {{cd|minecraft:input_air_controlled}} with format version 1.21.100 or older.
* Updates to {{cd|minecraft:dash}}.
** Renamed to {{cd|minecraft:dash_action}} to improve clarity.
* Updates to {{cd|minecraft:dash_action}}:
** Added new field {{cd|direction}} taking either {{cd|entity}} or {{cd|passenger}} as its value. Defaults to {{cd|entity}}:
*** {{cd|entity}}:
**** Behaves like before.
*** {{cd|passenger}}:
**** Momentum applied from the dash action will now instead be applied in the view direction of the passenger entity, using the {{cd|horizontal_momentum}} as forward momentum and {{cd|vertical_momentum}} as upward momentum in the direction of the passenger. Short of it: looking up with horizontal momentum will launch you upward.
*** Old schemas with format version older than {{cd|1.21.110}} will automatically receive the {{cd|entity}} direction.

'''Entity Components'''
* Added {{cd|slot.weapon.mainhand}} and {{cd|slot.weapon.offhand}} as valid slots for {{cd|minecraft:interact}} component operations.
* Changed the schema for the {{cd|minecraft:experience_reward}} entity component so that the {{cd|on_bred}} and {{cd|on_death}} members no longer accept arrays; only single Molang expressions are now supported for each member.

'''Entity Event Responses'''
* Added the {{cd|drop_item}} entity event response, which allows an entity to drop its item in a given slot.

'''Experimental'''
* Camera custom FOV command no longer requires the "Experimental Creator Cameras" experimental toggle.
* The experimental "Custom Biomes" option has been removed.
** This change has not been mentioned in the changelog.

'''[[Gameplay]]'''
* From {{cd|1.21.110}} onward, the free camera and fixed boom cameras use camera relative strafe as default scheme.

'''General'''
* Adding custom biomes to a world that already has custom biomes is more stable now.

'''Graphical'''
* Changed defaults for color grading contrast and saturation fields to 1. Previously the defaults were 1.2 and 1.05 respectively.

'''Item Components'''
* Repairing an item using the {{cd|minecraft:repairable}} item component no longer fails when a stack larger than strictly needed is used as repair material.
* Added the new {{cd|minecraft:fire_resistant}} item component, which determines whether an item is immune to burning when dropped in fire or lava.
** Functions like [[netherite]] items.

'''[[Item]]s'''
* Setting the {{cd|minecraft:use_modifiers}} component's {{cd|movement_modifier}} field to 1.0 now allows using the item while sprinting, and starting to sprint while using the item.
* {{cd|poly_mesh}} is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature.
* {{cd|texture_meshes}} is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature.
* The {{cd|scale}} field can now adjust the depth of {{cd|texture_meshes}}, since its value is no longer ignored.
* Added the {{cd|use_pixel_depth}} option to {{cd|texture_meshes}} to control how geometry depth relates to texture resolution.
** If set to {{cd|true}}, the geometry will have a depth of one pixel (in entity space, not texture space).
*** This causes textures with a resolution different from 16×16 to appear stretched.
** If set to {{cd|false}}, the geometry will be built from perfectly cubic voxels, regardless of the texture's aspect ratio.
** Defaults to {{cd|true}} to ensure backward compatibility.
* {{cd|poly_mesh}} is now documented as a deprecated feature:
** It was already treated as deprecated, but the documentation did not reflect this.
* {{cd|texture_meshes}} is no longer documented as an experimental feature:
** It was already treated as non-experimental, but the documentation did not reflect this.
* All items that can be eaten now have the [[item tag (Bedrock Edition)|tag]] {{cd|minecraft:is_food}}, except {{cd|glow_berries}}.
* Merged the inventory item for the iron chain ({{cd|chain}}) with the direct item form of the iron chain block ({{cd|item.chain}}). The merged item now has the ID {{cd|iron_chain}} (due to the renaming of the chain to iron chain) and has the numeric ID of the former {{cd|item.chain}}.

'''[[Mob]]s'''
* The {{cd|minecraft:shareables}} component now also accepts item entries specifying item tags to name all items tagged as that to become shareable with the given settings.
* Foxes now use the {{cd|minecraft:is_food}} tag instead of listing all foods manually, except {{cd|glow_berries}} which is still listed manually.

'''Molang'''
* Renamed {{cd|query.is_cooldown_type}} to {{cd|query.is_cooldown_category}}, to better reflect what it does.

'''Network Protocol'''
* Modified the binary format of {{cd|PlayerArmorDamagePacket}}.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "Upcoming Creator Features" [[experimental]] toggles.

=== Additions ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
:{{cd|@minecraft/server}}
* Added methods to {{cd|Dimension}} scripting API that allows creators to get the total light level and the sky light level at a specific position.

** Optional parameter {{cd|blockFilter?: BlockFilter}} filters the block being returned.
** Optional parameter {{cd|ignoreThinBlocks?: boolean}} determines if blocks of height 0.2 or lower are ignored.
* Added method {{cd|Camera.setCameraWithEase(cameraPreset: string, easeOptions: EaseOptions): void}} to {{cd|beta}}.
:{{cd|@minecraft/diagnostics}}
* Added method {{cd|captureException}} to Sentry which allows capturing of exceptions that are gracefully caught with a try/catch block.
* Added methods {{cd|setAfterBatchMethod}} and {{cd|setBeforeBatchMethod}} to {{cd|GameTest}}, which can be used to add methods that will be run before and after test batches.
* Added methods to Block scripting API that allows creators to get the total light level and the sky light level at a specific position.
* Added {{cd|InvalidPotionDeliveryTypeError}} and {{cd|InvalidPotionEffectTypeError}} errors to {{cd|beta}}.
* Potions
** Added {{cd|resolve(potionEffectType: PotionEffectType {{!}} T, potionDeliveryType: PotionDeliveryType {{!}} U): ItemStack}} method to {{cd|beta}}.
*** This replaces the {{cd|createPotion(options: PotionOptions): ItemStack}} that was removed from {{cd|ItemStack}}.
** Added {{cd|getAllDeliveryTypes(): PotionDeliveryType[]}} method to {{cd|beta}}.
*** This returns all the potion delivery types.
** Added {{cd|getAllEffectTypes(): PotionEffectType[]}} method to {{cd|beta}}.
*** This returns all the potion effect types.
* {{cd|PotionEffectType}}
** Added {{cd|readonly durationTicks?: number}} property to {{cd|beta}}.
*** This is the number of ticks the effect will last for. Undefined means the effect does not expire.
* Added new method {{cd|isChunkLoaded}} to {{cd|Dimension}} which returns true if a chunk at an area is loaded and ticking.
* Added enum {{cd|HeldItemOption}} to {{cd|beta}} for {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions}}. This specifies options related to the item currently being held at the time of a player swing:
<syntaxhighlight lang="c++">
export enum HeldItemOption {  
    AnyItem = 'AnyItem',       
    NoItem = 'NoItem'  
}
</syntaxhighlight>
* Added interface {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions}} to {{cd|beta}}. Event options/filters for {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent}}. - Field {{cd|heldItemOption?: HeldItemOption}}
** Added class {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent}} to {{cd|beta}}. This contains information regarding a player starting to swing their arm:
*** Field {{cd|heldItemStack?: ItemStack}}.
*** Field {{cd|player: Player}}.
** Added class {{cd|PlayerSwingStartAfter.EventSignal}} to {{cd|beta}}. This event is fired at the start of a player's swing (e.g. attacking, using an item, interacting). It can be subscribed/unsubscribed via {{cd|world.afterEvents.playerSwingStart}} and optionally filtered by passing in {{cd|PlayerSwingEventOptions}}.

'''[[Block]]s'''
* Added component {{cd|minecraft:redstone_producer}} behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.

'''Components'''
* Added new block component {{cd|minecraft:flower_pottable}}:
** It is an empty component defined as such: {{cd|minecraft:flower_pottable: <nowiki>{}</nowiki>}}.
** When the component is present on the block, > a player can interact with an empty flowerpot when holding the block in order to embed it.
** Similar to other Vanilla pottable blocks, a player can remove the potted block by interacting with the pot with an empty hand.
** The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.
** Pottable not potable.
* Added new block component {{cd|minecraft:embedded_visual}}:
** The component has two required fields, {{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}}, similarly to {{cd|minecraft:item_visual}}.
** When the component is present on the block, it defines which {{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}} to use when the block is embedded into another block, eg. into a flowerpot.
*** If the component is not present, embedded blocks fallback to their innate {{cd|geometry}} and {{cd|material_instances}}.
*** The component cannot be defined in the {{cd|permutations}} section; only one embedded visual can be achieved per block type.
** The component requires the Upcoming Creator Features toggle.
* Added new field {{cd|embedded}} to the {{cd|item_display_transforms}} object:
** The field defines the overall transformation this geometry should be subject to when embedded into a block, eg. a flowerpot.
** If the field is not defined, the default transformation is a 0.75x scale, similar to the one applied to most Vanilla flowers.

* Fixed a bug where the {{cd|minecraft:shareables}} component would mix attributes of duplicated entries in its {{cd|items}} list. E.g. the {{cd|priority}} would be taken from the first duplicated element and the {{cd|max_amount}} from the last, now the first {{cd|matching}} entry will fully shadow those coming after it. Consider this items list in a {{cd|minecraft:shareables}} using the new {{cd|tag}} functionality:<syntaxhighlight lang="json">
"items": [  
  { "item": "minecraft:apple", "priority": 1, "max_amount": 2 },
  { "item": "minecraft:is_food", "priority": 0, "max_amount": 1 }]
</syntaxhighlight> Previously {{cd|minecraft:apple}} would have had {{cd|priority}} 1 but {{cd|max_amount}} 1 instead of 2, now it will correctly use all data from that first item apple entry.

* Fixed issue where a default surface builder was not chosen leading to bare surfaces in some biomes.
* Fixed a bug where setting the precipitation of a biome to 0 in {{cd|biome.json}} files would not stop rain from occurring in the biome.
* Fixed a bug where putting items in a bundle as it is being transferred from one Hopper to another would delete the item.
* Fixed a crash that occurred when treatment packs were removed while loading game or loading into a world.
* Fixed a crash when downloading packs from a multiplayer world on Xbox.

:'''Updates for Creators'''
{{yt|1=WQzKqgwhfhM}}

== Trivia ==
* 1.21.111 is the first non-experimental content update named {{BE}} with a version number that does not end with a 0 on any platform.
** If including {{PE}}, it is the first such version to be released since [[Pocket Edition 1.1.3]].
** According to Mojang employee [[David Carlton]], the reason for this is that there was "one more fix to add".
* 1.21.110 is the 8th skipped version after 1.3.0, 1.15.0, 1.16.230, 1.17.20, 1.18.20, 1.20.20, and 1.21.10 being skipped.<ref>{{tweet|CornerHardMC|1973553144413167712|We had one more fix to add|October 2, 2025}}</ref>
