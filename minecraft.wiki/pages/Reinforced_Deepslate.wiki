'''Reinforced deepslate''' is a [[block]] that generates exclusively in [[ancient cities]]. It has high [[Breaking#Blocks by hardness|hardness]], is immune to [[explosion]]s, and cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s or obtained in [[Survival]] mode.

== Obtaining ==
Reinforced deepslate is not obtainable in Survival, even with [[Silk Touch]], and is only available through the Creative inventory, [[pick block]], or [[commands]].

=== Breaking ===
Reinforced deepslate has no tool associated with it, meaning it is mined at the exact same speed regardless of the tool used.

Reinforced deepslate drops nothing when destroyed. It also cannot be destroyed by the [[ender dragon]] and [[wither]].

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Reinforced Deepslate|drop=0}}

== Usage ==
Reinforced deepslate has no uses besides decoration.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Reinforced deepslate cannot be pushed by [[piston]]s or pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.
