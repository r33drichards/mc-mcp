A '''resin clump''' is a [[block]] generated by a [[creaking heart]] on [[pale oak]]s in any biome when a [[creaking]] is attacked. It also drops when a creaking heart is mined or destroyed. It can be used to craft decorative [[blocks of resin]], and can also be [[smelt]]ed to produce [[resin brick]]s, which in turn can be crafted into the whole resin brick block family.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Resin clump can be [[instant mining|instantly mined]] with any tool, including punching it.

=== Post-generation ===
{{main|Tutorial:Resin farming}}
When a [[creaking]] is attacked during night-time (between 12600 and 23400 ticks) by a player, a [[wolf]] owned by a player, or a player-caused [[explosion]], its associated [[creaking heart]] attempts to place 2 or 3 resin clumps on the sides of [[pale oak log]]s, [[stripped pale oak log]]s, [[pale oak wood]], and [[stripped pale oak wood]] blocks that are connected to the creaking heart and within 2 blocks [[taxicab distance]] from it, starting from the closest blocks. There is a 5-second cooldown before hitting a creaking can generate resin clumps again. Attacking a named creaking during the day does ''not'' produce resin clumps.

=== Block loot ===
1-3 resin clumps are dropped when a [[creaking heart]] is mined without [[Silk Touch]] or destroyed by an explosion. [[Fortune]] can increase the maximum drops by 1 per level (up to 6 with Fortune 3).

=== Generated loot ===
Resin clumps are found in [[woodland mansion]] chests.

=== Crafting ===

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Multiple resin clumps can be placed in the area of one solid block, such as covering three sides of a corner. When such resin clumps are mined, all resin clumps occupying the same block are also mined.

== Trivia ==
* Prior to the addition of resin to the game, [[toxic resin]] was part of the "[[Poisonous Potato Update]]" April Fools' earlier the same year. It could be turned into [[amber gem]]s for use as an armor trim material similar in color to [[resin brick]]s.
