'''[[File:Ender Chest JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[Ender chest]]'''

'''[[File:Sandstone Stairs JE1.png|36px]] [[Sandstone stairs]]'''

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Emerald JE1 BE1.png|36px]] [[Emerald]]'''
* Dropped when mining an [[emerald ore]] block.
* Used in villager [[trading]].

'''[[File:Enchanted Golden Apple JE1 BE1.gif|35px]] [[Enchanted golden apple]]'''
* A second type of golden apple made with [[blocks of gold]].
* After being consumed, the player receives 30 seconds of Regeneration IV, plus Resistance and Fire Resistance for 5 minutes.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Desert temple]]s'''
* New generated structure in desert biomes that resemble pyramids.
* Have a [[TNT]] trap and loot chests inside.

'''Desert [[village]]s'''
* Villages that generate in desert biomes now are made of sandstone rather than wood and cobblestone.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Trading]]'''
* Villagers buy or sell the player [[emerald]]s in exchange for certain items.
* Trade with villagers by right-clicking on them, opening up a GUI with one buying slot and one selling slot.

=== Command format ===
'''[[Command]]s'''
* {{cmd|seed}}
** Displays the current world seed.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:Dispenser_(S)_JE2_BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Dispenser]]s'''

* Also take water and lava source blocks if there is an empty bucket inside.

[[File:Gravel_JE4_BE3.png|36px]] '''[[Gravel]]'''
* Changed texture from [[File:Gravel_JE3_BE2.png|36px]].

[[File:Placeholder_Block_JE1_BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Locked chest]]'''

[[File:Minecart_JE3_BE1.png|36px]] '''[[Minecart]]s'''
