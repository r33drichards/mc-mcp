{{DISPLAYTITLE:Randy Peters ''Minecraft'' advertisements}}
The '''Randy Peters Minecraft advertisements''' are a series of humorous sketch videos, made to promote various miscellaneous ''Minecraft'' collaborations. They were created as a joint venture between [[Mojang Studios]], Swim Club<ref>{{Citation|url=https://swim.club/Minecraft-Randy-Peters|title=MINECRAFT – Randy Peters|website=swim.club|archive=1}}</ref>, and Kurppa Hosk Communications.{{TOC limit|3}}

[[File:Lose the Spoon.mp4|thumb|The Go-Gurt commercial.]]

=== LOSE THE SPOON ===
{{Main|Go-Gurt}}
==== Summary ====
A parody of infomercials, the video begins with black and white footage of [[Cool Cat]] typing on a keyboard, asking if the viewer "still eats your ''yogurt'' like this?" before showing a bowl of yogurt being spilled over the keys. A studio audience announces that it is time to "lose the spoon," as they cheer and one person fist pumps, seguing into the introduction of [[Randy Peters]]. "The Most Enthusiastic Guy We Could Find," Randy walks on stage by jumping and cheering as opposed to walking, and excitedly unveils ''Minecraft'' collaborating with the company ''Sodiaal''.

Announcing that {{Wikipedia|Go-Gurt|Go-Gurt}} "makes spoons a thing of the past," Randy begins to list various benefits of switching to the practice and credits [[Mojang Studios]] and the Go-Gurt brand for the collaboration. Taking a sip of a Go-Gurt himself, specifically the vanilla [[Nether Quartz|quartz]] variety, the [[Editor (character)|editor]] clarifies that there is no literal quartz in the product. Randy then approaches Cool Cat, who is eating yogurt on a skateboard, who he and the audience encourage to lose the spoon as well. In an instant, the spoon is replaced with a Go-Gurt, and the yogurt vanishing without explanation. Randy says that Cool Cat is now "ready to shred that gnar" while the editor clarifies that the character is portrayed by a stunt double and to not imitate their behavior. 

Announcing that the Go-Gurt is now available in stores, Randy once again encourages the viewer to "lose the spoon" and "find your favorite, now!" As the audience cheers, Randy says he will be promoting [[The Crafter's Kitchen: An Official Minecraft Cookbook|The Crafter's Kitchen]] "up next." He never does, as the video ends.

=== CANT.STOP.BRUSHING ===
{{Main|Colgate}}
==== Summary ====
A black and white child screams, as narration of Randy Peters asks if parents are having difficulty getting their kids to brush their teeth. Randy proceeds to elaborate, asking if they are hurling insults and/or slang at their parents, promoting the ''Minecraft'' toothbrush as a solution to this problem. Now credited as "being paid to say things," Randy rushes onto the stage, and promises great news, in the form of the toothbrush. Amazing the audience, Randy boasts that it "turns bedtime, into funtime!"

Explaining it as "science," Randy makes up a fantastical nonscientific method for powering the toothbrush, which the editor has to specify is hyperbolic. To back up these proven to be false claims, Randy brings over a caller, Mary McCorstin, and promptly shuts down her concerns that "the brushing never stops." Randy claims everyone is going wild over the toothbrush venture, and promises "more," referring to a vibration function and several bullet points. Urging the viewer to "not miss the boat on this one," as they are reportedly in very high demand, Randy suggests buying the product being promoted. While the audience cheers, the disclaimer editor gives their personal opinion on the claims made in the video, before explaining a long and complex story involving their mother.

As the editor elaborates on the story, blaming a character named Derrick, an awkward silence fills the room as the audience seemingly doesn't expect the video to continue as it does. The video then abruptly ends as many people stare confused and make forced smiles.

{{Collapse|content='''Girl''': ''screams''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Are you having trouble getting your kids to brush their teeth?"

A mother tries to hand her daughter a toothbrush, she begins squirming in fear.

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Are they calling you ''cringe''?"

'''Girl''': ''The word cringe appears from her mouth''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Scrub?! Griefer!?"

'''Girl''': ''The words scrub and griefer appear from her mouth''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Or other generational slang that you don't understand?"

'''Girl''': ''The phrases YOU SALTY!, THAT'S CAP!, and BET! appear as she lays on the ground, wailing''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Fear not!"

'''Audience''': ''Clapping''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Minecraft, together with Colgates, has just the thing for you!"

Randy Peters leisurely jogs into the room, with the caption "paid to say things"

'''Randy Peters''': "WHOOO! Hello, folks!"

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Man, do I got some great news for you guys today."

'''Randy Peters''': "You're gonna LOVE this! Introducing, the ALL-NEW, Minecraft, TOOTH BRUSH!"

'''Audience''': "Woooow."

The audience claps.

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "It turns bedtime..."

'''Randy Peters''': "...Into funtime! BUT HOW DOES IT WORK?!"

Screen turns to a blue screen with the following bullet points

''Boring stuff: Removed''

''Enjoyocules: Added''

''Toothbrushing: Affected in a positive manner''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Thanks to... science, we've removed the Snore McBore of brushing your teeth, and added the Enjoyocules of the Minecraft video game to create the perfect toothbrushing experience!"

'''Editor''' (disclaimer): * The existence of Enjoyocules has yet to be scientifically proven and remains a theoretical speculation.

'''Randy Peters''': "But don't take my word for it, I think we've got a caller on the line!"

Screen changes to an image of a phone on a brown backdrop, with a photo of Mary McCorstin, a 28 year old woman and mother of 4

'''Mary McCorstin''' (off screen): "Hi, Randy. My kids love the toothbrush, but they brush too much, Randy! The brushing never stops-"

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "OKAY! Thanks for the call!"

'''Randy Peters''': "ANOTHER happy customer! Everyone is going WILD over this thing!"

Jump cut to Randy in front of a potted plant.

'''Randy Peters''': "But wait, there's more!"

Screen changes to a toothbrush vibrating standing up, and then falling.

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "Equipped with a neat, vibration mechanism-"

The text "IT VIBRATES!" appears.

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "-this brush is tough on plaque but gentle on the gums."

The screen changes to another set of bullet points, such as:

''Cool vibrating mechanism''

''Amazing slim grip''

''Easy ON/OFF buttons''

''Effortless toothpaste application''

''Enjoyable Minecraft-inspired designs''

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "And with batteries included-"

The text "AA Batteries Included" then appear in green.

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "It's ready to go straight out of the box!"

'''Randy Peters''': "DO NOT MISS THE BOAT ON THIS ONE, THESE THINGS ARE FLYING OFF THE SHELF!"

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "GET YOURS NOW!"

'''Audience''': ''clapping''

Disclaimer appears specifying that it's available in select stores.

'''Editor''' (disclaimer): DISCLAIMER: The correlation between toothbrushing and Enjoyecules (Genu alapas moleculis) has yet to be proven and remains a theoretical speculation with very little scientific proof. The existence of Enjoyecules (Genu alapas moleculis) is as well unproven. Ok, nothing said here has any scientific barring. This brush is just fun or "more fun"  than your regular toothbrush. Maybe a connection to Minecraft makes it more fun? I don't know. They just made up some scientific stuff as a joke. Was it a funny joke? Who knows? Humor is subjective and all that. Personally, I got myself a giggle. But my sense of humor has never been my strong side. Look at me rambling on. My mom always said that i talked too much. It's ironic when we don't talk much these days. I should call.  But I know it will just be all "You don't call anymore?", "Why aren't you married?", "Why don't you get a better job?". I'M NEVER GONNA BE LIKE DERRICK, MOM; GET OVER IT!!! Like, get off my back already! Derrick was my next-door neighbor growing up. He's on his way to becoming a state attorney general. How do you compete with that? I'm writing disclaimers that nobody reads and coming home to an empty apartment with a tower of unwashed dishes. They've started to smell. But I bought a jasmine-scented candle yesterday, so it's not that bad now. I would clean more often, but I don't have the energy, you know. And a spider has claimed the cleaning cupboard, and it's very territorial, so I don't go there anymore. Only if the spider could pay part of the rent would this not be a problem. But sadly my landlord doesn't consider webbed-up flies and half-eaten moths to be valid payments. Oh well, life, it's a pickle. Anyway, the stuff being said here is not based on anything scientific. Have a good day, and so on.

'''Audience''': ''cheering that slowly devolves into confusion''

'''Editor''' (disclaimer): Hello, me again! I'm sorry to lay all my problems on you like that. It was maybe a tad too much. It's not your burden to bear, I know that. But I'm thankful that you listened. If you read this, that is. Maybe no one did. Who knows? Again, sorry and goodbye!

'''Audience''': ''bafflement''

'''Editor''' (disclaimer): Do you also imagine these people are clapping for you? That's what I do sometimes here in my editing room. Feels nice to feel appreciated sometimes. My boss says my paycheck is appreciation enough. I kinda disagree. Sorry, there I go again. Rambling. What to do, what to do? I will stop now. Anyway, goodbye! For real, this time.

'''Audience''': ''blinks''}}

=== CROCHET ALL DAY ===
[[File:Crochet All Day.mp4|thumb|The ''The Woobles'' commercial.]]{{Main|The Woobles}}

==== Summary ====
Unlike the others, this video opens in media res, on an informal interview with a biker named Wayne Wheeler. He is in the process of crying, having apparently told a somber story to Randy Peters before an ad break. Wishing to cheer him up, Randy unveils the ''Minecraft Woobles'' collaboration, revealing himself to be a "doctor of yarn." Cool Cat arrives, removing a basket of fruit with the crochet kits, receiving an ovation from the audience. Explaining what ''the Woobles'' is, Randy assures the viewer that anyone can make one.

To Wayne's delight, he is not only getting one set of ''Minecraft'' ''Woobles'', but every set released up to that point. The audience cheers again, as Randy proceeds to reveal that he had placed ''Woobles'' kits underneath their seats. Declaring that "we all become Wooblers today!," the audience begins to come at odds over the gift. Randy instigates the conflict by jumping onto his seat and chanting "CROCHET ALL DAY" as Wayne joins him, before people begin chanting as well and several start to fight. The editor chimes in to stress this is not a real fight.

'''Audience''': ''claps''

A man wearing a blue buttoned shirt smiles, and then a bald man with shades smiles.

Man in gray striped shirt looks envious.

'''Randy Peters''': "And he's not the only one getting some yarn. Check under your seats, folks!"

'''Audience''': ''check under seats in unison''

The audience begin to get their kits, beginning with the gray shirted man.

'''Randy Peters''' (off screen): "That's right-"

'''Randy Peters''': "You get a kit, and you get a kit! We all become Wooblers today!"

A boom operator looks on in horror.

'''Audience''': ''making noises of panic''

'''Randy Peters''': "Just look at all the fun we're having! Visit your local [[computer]], and click your way to the Minecraft Woobles, today!"

[[File:Pez the Mic.mp4|thumb|The ''PEZ'' dispenser commercial.]]

=== PEZ THE MIC ===
{{Main|PEZ}}

==== Summary ====
The video opens in media res, with Randy explaining that "the fork goes in the right hand," and promising to explain where the knife goes after a sponsor break, sponsored by ''{{Wikipedia|PEZ}}''. As the audience cheers, the scene transitions to Cool Cat using a turntable, as Randy Peters begins a rap number and an audience member stares on baffled. The song is about the ''Minecraft'' collaboration with ''PEZ'', introducing each individual ''PEZ'' dispenser. He begins with [[Steve]], then [[Alex]], a [[creeper]], and a "friendly face," a [[pig]]. As Cool Cat begins a solo, the editor writes a lengthy citation emphasizing that eating ''PEZ'' does not enhance the consumer's ability to rap and does another monologue about his father, a fantasy novel he was developing, and Derrick.

As the editor rambles, Randy and an audience member do extensive dance choreography together, culminating in several filters. Once the rambling concludes, Randy begins to list off "PEZ-ential info," and then tells the viewer to get them "at home, online, or at the mall!" A final bit of information is given: an exclusive [[enderman]] ''PEZ'' dispenser is in a gift box.

== Trivia ==
* The [[Creeper Head|creeper head]] that Cool Cat wears is a popular piece of existing merchandise, beginning production very early into the franchise history.
** Their appearance also resembles various skins from various texture packs, such as [[Skin Pack 4|Creeper Suit]] and [[1st Birthday Skin Pack|Steve Creeper Boxhead]].
*The series was created in part due to a large budget being allocated for a promotion of Go-Gurt, as well as "targeting the household buying power (millennials/gen X) and their fond memories of terrible '00s infomercials".<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chad-oetken_lifeswork-losethespoon-activity-7173511459296014336-yRMQ|title=Chad, we've got budget for a Go-Gurt ad. Any ideas?|author=Chad Oetken|website=LinkedIn|date=March 13, 2024|archive=1}}</ref>
*The scene in ''CROCHET ALL DAY'' where Randy gives everyone in attendance ''the Woobles'' is a reference to the September 13th, 2004 episode of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', where everyone in attendance was given a car.<ref>{{YouTube link|pviYWzu0dzk|Oprah you get a car|Blake Uhlenbrock|December 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|8CAscBCdaQg|Oprah's Ultimate Car Giveaway {{!}} Oprah's Life Class {{!}} Oprah Winfrey Network|OWN|October 15, 2011}}</ref>
