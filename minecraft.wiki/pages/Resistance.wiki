'''Resistance''' is a [[status effect]] that reduces incoming [[damage]].

== Effect ==
Resistance reduces incoming [[damage]] by 20% × level from all sources except for [[starvation]], the [[void]], and {{cmd|kill}}.

Resistance is applied only to the remaining damage after all other damage reductions ([[Armor#Damage protection|armor]] and [[Armor#Enchantments|enchantments]]), but ''before'' rounding down to a whole number. This means any equipped armor pieces still lose the usual amount of durability, even at level 5+ where the potion effect grants complete immunity to most sources.

== Immune mobs ==
*[[Wither]]s and [[ender dragon]]s are immune to Resistance.
*[[Creaking]]s that spawn from [[creaking heart]] are unaffected by Resistance, because they are already 100% resistant to all type of damage (except for [[void]] and {{cmd|kill}}). Creakings spawned from a spawn egg or using commands are still affected by this effect.
