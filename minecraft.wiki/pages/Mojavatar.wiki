A '''Mojavatar''' (a portmanteau of "Mojang" and "Avatar") is an avatar created to represent a [[Mojang Studios]] employee.<ref name=marathonjnkboy>{{Tweet|jnkboy|158236760340578307|Only 1 day left to bid on all the @MC_Marathon auctions.

(will showcase more later!) ❤️|January 28, 2021}}</ref> Mojavatars can usually be seen in news articles on [[minecraft.net]] or on the Mojang Staff's social media profiles.

The current Mojavatars are made with the ''Mojavatar Maker'', an internal private program for creating 3D avatars in a style similar to the ''[[Minecraft]]'' look. While this current iteration is most common, the two previous styles are still in use by some developers to this day, and can still be seen in some news articles.

== Mojavatar Maker ==
The '''Mojavatar Maker''' is the avatar creator program made by Mojang Studios to help themselves create new avatar images for the new or current staff, it uses a 3D Minecraft Chibi style with a low pixel resolution for the avatars and include a large variety of cosmetics, hair styles, etc.

It is for internal use only by Mojang Studios staff and there's currently no public version for public use.<ref>{{Tweet|artofsully|1354914833842507776|And alas no sorry friends, this isn't going to be a public tool since that would kindaaa defeat the purpose of giving Mojang staff our unique identity haha! That said, do check our jobs page and join us if u wanna be a part of the family! 😄<br><br>(or open Photoshop 😉)|January 28, 2021}}</ref>

== History ==
=== 2010–2016: The original Mojang AB drawings ===
Mojang avatars were initially created as 2D hand-drawn illustrations by [[Markus Toivonen]]<ref name=seargetweet>{{Tweet|SeargeDP|425578584359833600|@notch @_andrio That's a cool one. I'm still looking forward to get my Mojang avatar from @jnkboy, he'll have time for it eventually :)|January 21, 2014}}</ref> as 2D hand-drawn illustrations for the core Mojang AB team in 2010.

=== 2016–2021: 3D renders ===
Starting in 2016, Mojavatars transitioned to a 3D format, also hand-crafted, featuring a Minecraft-inspired chibi style with higher pixel resolution, similar to the [[Super Duper Graphics Pack]].

=== 2021–present: Mojavatar Maker ===
As the number of employees at Mojang grew, it became no longer viable to create avatars manually. In 2021 after the Mojang Studios rebrand, a group of developers therefore created an internal program, the Mojavatar Maker, to make the avatars more quickly and easily.<ref>{{Tweet|artofsully|1355587750855118854|Wow - thanks for the warm response to the Mojavatar project guys! Very much a side gig to normal work, it's nice to see it completed! ❤️<br><br>Traditionally avi's were made by hand but since Mojang has grown so much it's not as viable to do that anymore, thus Mojavatar Maker was born!|January 30, 2021}}</ref><ref name=sullytweet />

This is the current version of the Mojavatars. They are presented as a 3D model with a chibi and low pixel resolution style that almost all employees use currently.
