'''1.21.9 Pre-Release 1''' (known as '''1.21.9-pre1''' in the [[launcher]]) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.21.9]], released on September 16, 2025 with some changes to the mannequins and several bug fixes.<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-21-9-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.21.9 Pre-Release 1|September 16, 2025}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Copper golem]]'''
* Lightning bolts now clean oxidation off copper golems.
* Now only tries to open [[chest]]s that are neighboring blocks when it's a passenger.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Mannequin]]'''
* Mannequins' description text can now be configured.
* Now accept {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component from spawner items.
** Modified data fields:
*** {{cd|profile}} - now has the same format as a {{cd|minecraft:profile}} component (which has been extended to allow overrides).
**** Defaults to <code>{}</code> (i.e. static profile with both {{cd|id}} and {{cd|name}} missing).
** New data fields:
*** {{cd|pose}} - The pose of the mannequin.
**** Valid entries: {{cd|standing}}, {{cd|crouching}}, {{cd|swimming}}, {{cd|fall_flying}}, {{cd|sleeping}}.
*** {{cd|immovable}} - Optional boolean specifying that the mannequin cannot be moved (defaults to {{cd|false}}).
*** {{cd|description}} - Optional text component shown where a player's {{cd|below_score}} score would show.
**** The default "NPC" ({{cd|entity.minecraft.mannequin.label}}) text is shown if omitted.
*** {{cd|hide_description}} - Optional boolean specifying that no description should be shown at all.
**** A mannequin with the description hidden displays as if a player had no {{cd|below_score}} display.

=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Server commands now run from the respawn dimension by default instead of always the [[Overworld]].

'''{{cmd|fetchprofile}}'''
* Now also prints a clickable text to summon a [[mannequin]] with the resolved profile.

'''{{cmd|setworldspawn}}'''
* Is no longer limited to the Overworld.
** This means players can respawn e.g. in the Nether when they have no [[bed]] or [[respawn anchor]].
* It now also takes in an optional {{cd|pitch}} argument.

'''{{cmd|spawnpoint}}'''
* Now optionally takes in a pitch argument.

=== General ===
'''[[Data component format]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:profile}}
** Profiles can now also have additional fields that can replace various values used for rendering.
** If any of the fields are omitted, the value from the resolved profile is used, even if the profile resolved to the default skin.
** New fields:
*** {{cd|texture}} - Optional namespaced ID of the skin texture to use for rendering.
**** The skin is specified relative to the {{cd|textures}} folder and with a {{samp|.png}} suffix.
**** e.g. {{cd|entity/player/wide/steve}} will use the default wide Steve skin.
*** {{cd|cape}} - Optional namespaced ID of the cape texture to use for rendering.
**** When specified, uses the same format as the {{cd|texture}} field.
*** {{cd|elytra}} - Optional namespaced ID of the [[elytra]] texture to use for rendering.
**** When specified, uses the same format as the {{cd|texture}} field.
**** If this value is not present either as override or in player profile, mannequins using this profile will use the cape texture, or if that is also not present, the default elytra texture when wearing elytra.
*** {{cd|model}} - Optional model type, one of {{cd|wide}} and {{cd|slim}}.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|87.1}}.

'''[[Entity data]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:player}}
** Changes to the {{cd|respawn}} object
*** {{cd|angle}} has been renamed to {{cd|yaw}} and is now a required field.
*** {{cd|pitch}} has been added as a required field.
*** {{cd|dimension}} is now a required field.

'''[[Loot functions]]'''
* {{cd|minecraft:copy_name}}
** The {{cd|source}} field now accepts new context values:
*** {{cd|direct_attacker}}
*** {{cd|target_entity}}
*** {{cd|interacting_entity}}
* {{cd|minecraft:copy_components}}
** The {{cd|source}} field now accepts new context values:
*** {{cd|this}}
*** {{cd|attacker}}
*** {{cd|direct_attacker}}
*** {{cd|attacking_player}}
*** {{cd|target_entity}}
*** {{cd|interacting_entity}}
*** {{cd|tool}}

'''[[Minecraft Server Management Protocol]]'''
* Notifications now use {{cd|minecraft:notification/}} prefix instead of {{cd|notification:}}.
