'''18w06a''' is the seventeenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on February 9, 2018<ref name=":0">{{snap|18w06a|February 9, 2018}}</ref>, which mostly added two new [[air]] variants, added new biomes for the End, re-added {{cmd|enchant}}, added a furnace recipe book, and the rewrite of the world generation system which resulted in the removal of the [[Old Customized|Customized]] world type.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Air (shown) JE2.png|32px]] [[Air]]'''
* Added <code>minecraft:cave_air</code> and <code>minecraft:void_air</code>.
* Both have the exact same properties as regular air.
** <code>minecraft:cave_air</code> generates in caves.
** <code>minecraft:void_air</code> is used internally for blocks below or above the world and in unloaded chunks.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Biome]]s'''
* Added <code>minecraft:sky_island_low</code> (The End - Floating Islands), <code>minecraft:sky_island_medium</code> (The End - Medium island), <code>minecraft:sky_island_high</code> (The End - High island), and <code>minecraft:sky_island_barren</code> (The End - Barren island).

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|enchant}}'''
* Re-added the command into the game.

'''Entity selectors'''
* Added command suggestions for entity selectors.

=== General ===
'''[[Recipe book]]'''
* Recipe book icon now is a separate file, it's stored in the <code>recipe_button.png</code>.
* Added a recipe book for the furnace.
** Furnace recipes have been moved to JSON files.
*** They use <code>"type": "smelting"</code>.
*** <code>cookingtime</code> is used to determine the time it should take to smelt an item in the furnace.
*** <code>experience</code> is used to determine the amount of experience a player should get when picking the resulting item out of the furnace manually.
*** Fuel is not included and is still hardcoded.
* "Unlocked recipe" toasts now show an icon in the top left to specify whether the unlocked recipe is a crafting or smelting recipe.

=== [[Tag]]s ===
* Added new vanilla block tags:
** <code>minecraft:banners</code>, <code>minecraft:wooden_pressure_plates</code>, <code>minecraft:wooden_slabs</code>, and <code>minecraft:wooden_stairs</code>.
* Added new vanilla item tags:
** <code>minecraft:banners</code>, <code>minecraft:boats</code>, <code>minecraft:wooden_pressure_plates</code>, <code>minecraft:wooden_slabs</code>, and <code>minecraft:wooden_stairs</code>.

== Changes ==
=== Items ===
'''[[Crops]]'''
* Wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, melons, and pumpkins now can grow at night. Previously, they needed at least an [[internal light level]] of 9, but this was changed so that they needed only a sky or block light of the same level.

=== World generation ===
'''General'''
* Rewrote the world generation system.
* Structures previously grouped under "Temple" have their spawning locations changed, this allowed {{cmd|/locate}} to differentiate between the structures.
* In [[the Nether]], vertical air cavities — stretching from bedrock level to as far as Y=35, and filled with [[lava]] from bedrock level to Y=10 – now occur in chains across the bottom of the Nether, often forming extensive ravines.

'''[[Old Customized|Customized]] world type'''
* Removed as a result of the world generation changes.

'''[[Tree]]s'''
* Large [[spruce tree]]s now transform nearby [[grass block]]s into [[podzol]] when they grow.
* Trees occasionally generated upside down.<ref>{{Bug|MC-124897}}</ref>

=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Whitespaces are now allowed in entity selectors & blockstate arguments.

'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Now accepts different structure names for all structures previously grouped under <code>Temple</code>.
** <code>Desert_Pyramid</code>, <code>Igloo</code>, <code>Jungle_Pyramid</code>, and <code>Swamp_Hut</code>.
