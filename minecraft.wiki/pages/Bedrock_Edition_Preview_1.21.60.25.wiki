**{{cd|:_input_key.use:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.chat:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.attack:}}
**{{cd|:_input_key.sprint:}}
*The icons for these strings are updated in diverse areas of the game that support contextual glyphs, such as: signs, signed books, tags, chat, commands.
*Also, as improvement, replacement of these values depends on the interaction/control mode when using touch as input mode. These modes are Joystick & tap to interact, D-Pad & tap to interact, and Joystick & aim crosshair.
