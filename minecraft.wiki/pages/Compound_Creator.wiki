The '''compound creator''' is a [[block]] used in chemistry. It allows over 30 [[compound]]s to be created by combining [[element]]s. This includes certain [[item]]s which are available in the game normally.

== Obtaining ==
Compound creators can be obtained from the [[Creative inventory]]. They cannot be obtained in [[Survival]] without [[commands]]. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the world must also have the "Education Edition" setting enabled.

=== Breaking ===
A compound creator can be mined with any tool, but [[pickaxe]]s are faster.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Compound Creator|pickaxe|drop=1}}

== Usage ==
{{main|Compound}}
{{control|Using}} the compound creator opens up a 3×3 grid, where [[element]]s can be inserted to create [[compound]]s. By inputting the appropriate type and number of elements, the creator outputs the component in the slot to the right of the grid. All compound recipes are shapeless, and unlike the [[crafting table]], the stack sizes are taken into consideration. Also, unlike with most blocks with an interface, the elements are not consumed.
