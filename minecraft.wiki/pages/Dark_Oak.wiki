'''Dark oak''' is a type of [[tree]] with dark bark and wood, being a dark variant of [[oak]]. Dark oaks have thick trunks (2&times;2 blocks) and are found in the [[dark forest]] biome.

== Appearance ==
Dark oak trees generate with thick 2×2 trunks. [[Dirt]] blocks appear under the trunk if generated on a steep cliff. Dark oak trees nearly always generate with irregular [[log]]s connected to the trunk – these represent large branches.

Dark oak trees with trunks consisting of 1×1 dark oak logs, instead of 2×2, can be found in two types of rooms in [[woodland mansion]]s: the [[Woodland mansion#1x2 a6|tree chopping room]], and the [[Woodland Mansion/Structure/Trophy Rooms#Tree Room With Water|nature room]]. These are not generated elsewhere in the world, and cannot be grown from saplings.

== Generation ==
Dark oaks spawn naturally only in the [[dark forest]] biome. A dark oak always generates with [[dirt]] under its trunk, even if it spawns partly or wholly over [[air]] or [[water]] blocks.

== Blocks and items ==
These items can be obtained from all variants of dark oak:
*{{BlockLink|Dark Oak Log}} (harvested with any tool including hands)
*{{BlockLink|Dark Oak Leaves}} (harvested with [[shears]])
*{{ItemLink|Stick}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
*{{BlockLink|Dark Oak Planks}} (created from a log in the inventory crafting grid)
*{{BlockLink|Stripped Dark Oak Log}} (created by {{control|using}} an [[axe]] on a log)
*{{BlockLink|Dark Oak Sapling}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
*{{ItemLink|Apple}} (chance of dropping when breaking leaves)
*{{BlockLink|Vines}}{{only|be}} (harvested with [[shears]] from a dying tree)

== Planting ==
Dark oak [[sapling]]s can be planted on:
{{columns-list|
*{{BlockLink|Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Podzol}}
*{{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
*{{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
*{{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
*{{BlockLink|Farmland}}
*{{BlockLink|Mud}}
*{{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
}}
Growing these trees requires four dark oak saplings arranged in a 2×2 grid; they do ''not'' grow if planted individually. Dark oak trees grow at a much faster rate than most other trees. They require a 3×3 column of unobstructed space at least 7 blocks above the northwestern sapling to grow (8 blocks including the sapling itself). Additionally, dark oak trees require 5×5 layers without obstruction for the top 3 layers of its final height. No horizontal clearance is needed at the base of the tree (saplings planted in a 2×2 hole 1 block deep still grow).

== Dying dark oaks ==
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}[[File:Dying Trees.jpg|thumb|The different dying tree types.]]
{{IN|bedrock}}, dark oaks can generate as a dying tree. Dying dark oaks generate naturally, and can be grown from normal saplings.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190711143349/http://i.imgur.com/hTg0N8J.gifv</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-21304}}</ref> A dying dark oak has the standard growth pattern of any other tree, however, all exposed logs in the main trunk are covered with [[vines]].
