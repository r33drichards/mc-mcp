'''Beta 1.17.20.22''' is the third beta version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.30]], released on July 14, 2021,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4404997186189|title=Minecraft Beta - 1.17.20.22 (Xbox One/Windows 10/Android)|website=feedback.minecraft.net|date=July 14, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-beta-1-17-20-22|Minecraft Beta 1.17.20.22|14 July 2021|Jay Wells}}</ref> which made mob spawning changes behind experimental toggle, and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Light Block]]'''
* Light blocks now reveal a particle when the player is holding the item.
** Unlike in ''[[Java Edition]]'', the respective item texture is used as the particle instead of four yellow stars.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Axolotl]]s'''
* Axolotls now spawn only where there's a stone block less than 10 blocks below the spawning space.

=== General ===
[[File:Beta 1.17.20.22 Logo Difference.jpg|thumb|150px|Difference of the old logo and the new logo of the loading screen.]]
'''User Interface'''
* Slightly changed the Minecraft logo on the loading screen and main menu (before Beta panorama loaded).

=== Technical ===
'''Commands '''
* Target selectors {{cd|ry}} and {{cd|rym}} now support wrapping around north 
 
'''Spawning '''
* Similar to the {{cd|spawns_on_block_filter}}, the {{cd|spawns_above_block_filter}} specifies a list of blocks and a distance.
** The mob can then spawn only if the nearest block within the specified distance below the desired spawnpoint is in that list (water and air not included).

== Experimental ==
These changes are accessible by enabling the "[[Caves & Cliffs]]" and "Enable GameTest Framework" experimental toggle.

=== Blocks ===
'''[[Glow Lichen]]'''
* Can now generate below Y=0 to Y=-64.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Axolotl]]'''
* Now only spawn in lush caves.
* Can now spawn below Y=0 to Y=-64.

'''[[Glow Squid]]'''
* Can now spawn below Y=0 to Y=-64.

'''[[Goat]]'''
* Now only spawn in [[mountain meadow]] biome.

'''General '''
* [[Block light]] level now must be 0 for [[Light#Mobs|many hostile mobs]] to spawn.<ref>{{tweet|_Ulraf_|1414985600273428480|Some more information about: "Monsters will only spawn in complete darkness" * This means that generic monster spawning is now only in complete darkness. (Mobs that have special rules like slimes or phantoms are unaffected by this) * This only affects block-light, not sky-light}}</ref>

=== World generation ===
'''[[Dripstone Cluster]]'''
* Can now generate below Y=0 to Y=-64.

'''[[Dripstone Caves]] and [[Lush Caves]] biome'''
* Can now generate below Y=0 to Y=-64.

=== Technical ===
'''GameTest Framework'''
* Renamed {{cd|BlockTypes}} class to {{cd|MinecraftBlockTypes}} 
* Renamed {{cd|Effects}} class to {{cd|MinecraftEffectTypes}} 
* Renamed {{cd|Items}} class to {{cd|MinecraftItemTypes}} 
* Events 
** Added read-only property currentTick to tick event - Returns the current server tick 
** Renamed event {{cd|createEntity}} to {{cd|entityCreate}} 
** Renamed event {{cd|addEffect}} to {{cd|effectAdd}} 
** Renamed event {{cd|activatePiston}} to {{cd|pistonActivate}}
** Renamed event {{cd|beforeActivatePiston}} to {{cd|beforePistonActivate}}
** Renamed event {{cd|explodeBlock}} to {{cd|blockExplode}} 
** Renamed event {{cd|changeWeather}} to {{cd|weatherChange}}
