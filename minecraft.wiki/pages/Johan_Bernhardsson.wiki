'''Johan Bernhardsson''' is a former game developer at [[Mojang Studios]], who worked extensively on ''[[Minecraft: Pocket Edition]]'', and over a year by himself. Johan resigned from Mojang on September 11, 2015.
In his last few weeks at Mojang, he worked on the OS X Launcher for ''[[Minecraft]]''.

Being interested in IT, Johan taught himself to program and has ever since become enthusiastic about it.<ref>{{ytl|vhs|t=25m45s}}</ref>

Previously, Bernhardsson worked as a ''[[wikipedia:Half-Life 2|Half-Life 2]]'' modder, a minigame developer and a software engineer. Before becoming involved with Mojang, he worked as a programmer for Stunlock Studios on the action real-time strategy game ''Bloodline Champions'', which became a minor electronic sports title.

On September 3, 2015, Jeb posted on Instagram that Johan was leaving Mojang.<ref>https://instagram.com/p/7LMcAGpMNn/</ref>

A week later, on September 11, 2015, Johan officially tweeted<ref>{{tweet|jbernhardsson|642352348979982336|Today was my last day at Mojang. I have moved to Malmö and will keep making games. Maybe not as big as Minecraft. :)|September 11, 2015}}</ref> that he had finished his last day at Mojang.

On January 28, 2016, Johan announced that he started a new game studio, Midnight Hub, and a new horror game called Lake Ridden.<ref>{{tweet|jbernhardsson|692740218391236608|Today we finally announce our new game studio Midnight Hub!
