'''Nuggets''' are minimum pieces of [[metal]] that can be crafted into [[ingot]]s and used in the crafting of [[name tag]]s{{upcoming|First Drop 2026}}. They can also be crafted into other items, depending on the type of nugget.

All nuggets can be obtained by being crafted from ingots or from [[smelting]] their respective [[tool]]s, [[sword]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[armor]].

Since all nuggets can be both crafted from and crafted into ingots, which can be further crafted into [[Mineral block|blocks of metal]], one nugget is equivalent of {{frac|1|9}} of the corresponding ingot and {{frac|1|81}} of the corresponding block of metal.
