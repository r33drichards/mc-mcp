'''SoulSteel''' is a dungeon crawler [[server]] for {{BE}} created by [[Noxcrew]]. It is a [[featured server]].

== Summary ==
=== Learning ===
The player begins the game in the starting location with low health and a notification that the airship they were on has been broken. The player then needs to go straight ahead and pick up a skimitar. Further along, the player can pick up a regeneration potion and restore their health. Next, the player needs to cross an obstacle into a cave inhabited by angry lizards. After exiting the cave, the player needs to talk to Aurano and complete his tasks in the dungeon Ruined Temple, near Aurano. First, the player will need to collect coins, then some chrono essence, and then open a chest with a key. The player initially has only 30 seconds to spend in the dungeon, but the more the player collects chrono essence, the more time increases. After completing all the tasks, the player will need to walk into an activated cannon, which will transport the player to another location. In this location, the player will meet Dana. She will offer the player a deal, and the player will need to enter the treasure room and fight off lizards. The player must defeat several enemies to open the treasure. After defeating the lizards and claiming the treasure, the player will need to go through a portal that will take them to Port Fortuna. Dana will send the player to Isabella and Paulo, from whom they can choose one weapon: Poisoned Blade or Arcane Halberd. Then the player needs to go to the Travel Master to get to the Old Kingdom.

=== Port Fortuna ===
Port Fortuna is the main hub. Here you can find all the NPCs and workbenches to process materials and upgrade equipment. The square contains workshops where you can craft and upgrade weapons, armor, runes, and accessories. Directly from the spawn is a Travel Master, through which you can travel to other locations. Further on are traders with ingots, thread, gems, and ink. Next to them are workbenches where you can refine and purchase items for the item dust. There is also Ms Camp which sells camp decorations.
==== Pyramid Parkour ====
To the right of the spawn is a huge pyramid full of obstacles. To get to the parkour by going behind the armor workshop. Near Ms. Camp's shop, there's a ladder leading up to the pyramid. Climbing to the top will yield valuable rewards.

=== Camp ===
The camp is where you spawn in a dungeon or the Old Kingdom. The player can customize their camp with cosmetics they can buy with minecoins or scrip.

=== Old Kingdom ===
Traveling to this location is free. After teleporting, if the player goes right, they can reach a portal to the Valley of Wealth, and if they go left, to the cannon, which will shoot the player to the beginning of the old kingdom. Rubble Lizards and Drybone Lackeys appear throughout the old kingdom, with other enemies like the Praetorian or Rattlebone appearing in more remote and special areas. Every few minutes, one of three events takes place, each taking two minutes to prepare.

[[File:Old Kingdom Map.png|500px|thumb]]

==== Challenges ====
* Monster Invasion
** Defeat 40 Drybone Lackeys
* Supply Delivery
** Deliver supplies from point A to point B
* Elemental Mining
** Collect 25 Earthen Stones, which drops from Earth Elementals.
Before the event starts, a message appears in the chat indicating the location of the event, and the event locations themselves are marked with beacons. Monster Invasion has a red beacon, Supply Delivery has a blue beacon, and Elemental Mining has a yellow beacon. The events themselves last a few minutes, during which the player must complete a task, and upon completion, a reward is awarded. Near the start of the area, on the right, there's an excavated hole with a shovel sticking out of it, containing a chest the player can open to get some resources. In the Gardens of Semkaris, there's a portal to the Temple of Semkaris. In the Ruined City, the player can find a mystic creature that can be sheared. In the center of a small lake not far from the gate, the player can collect some ink from a black flower.
==== Relic altar ====
A level 99 Empowered mob will spawn at one of four locations on the map. The location and mob rotate daily. The Relic Boss can be a Shieldguard, Undying Lictor, Praetorian, or Tombguard, and the boss can appear in one of four locations:
*Pit near the spawn
*Under Ruined Gardens
*Colleseum
*Palace Quarry
After killing the boss, a Relic Altar will appear. You can use this altar to open any relics in your inventory for great loot, including artifact weapon fragments and parts, surging runes, artifact armor fragments, high-tier resources, etc. The altar has a cooldown of 3 minutes and can not be used until the cooldown ends. Although the Empowered mob has level 99, it is weaker than a mob with level 50.

==== Enemies ====
*Rubble Lizards
*Drybone Lackeys
*Lord's Apprentices
*Tombguards (can be a Relic Boss)
*Rattleblades
*Earth Elementals
*Royal Archers
*Shieldguards (can be a Relic Boss)
*Shrikeback Turtles 
*Praetorians (can be a Relic Boss)
*Undying Lictors (can be a Relic Boss)

==== Other mobs ====
*Mystical Creature

=== Valley of Wealth ===
To unlock it, you need to complete the tutorial. You can find this portal near Spawn. This is an easy dungeon, with more advanced enemies only being found in select places, like the Dark Altar room. This is a great place to try new weapons and upgrade them before tougher dungeons. An easy way to get B tier in about 3 minutes is to solve the animal puzzle, go to the gold hoard directly in front of spawn, and then go up the stairs to the third gold hoard on the right side of the starting portal. This will allow you to quickly upgrade your basic weapon and armor abilities. This dungeon is easy.

==== Challenges ====
*Symbol Dial Puzzle

In the Valley of Wealth, there is a puzzle room located in the center of the dungeon. Inside, players will find four spinning dials, each placed on a distinct patterned block. These dials can be rotated to display different symbols. Throughout the dungeon, players can find these same symbols placed on patterned blocks that match the ones in the central room. To solve the puzzle, players must explore the dungeon, locate each symbol, and remember which one belongs with which patterned block. Once all four have been identified, return to the central room and rotate the dials so that each block shows the correct symbol. Completing the puzzle rewards the party with 800 gold.

A quick way to solve this puzzle is to locate the first three symbols in the dungeon, then spin the final dial until the puzzle unlocks. You could also do the puzzle only knowing two of the symbols, systematically checking each of the 16 remaining options. Bear in mind that symbols can repeat.

*Crystal Puzzle

The Crystal Puzzle can be found in an area off to the right of the spawn point. To begin, players must defeat a wave of enemies to obtain a Crystal Heart. The heart will randomly appear as blue, green, orange, or pink. Once the Crystal Heart has been collected, it must be carried to the matching colored crystal in the dungeon within a certain timeframe. Depositing the Heart at the correct crystal completes the puzzle and gives 1,200 gold.

This gold can be used to get the needed amount for the dark altar quickly.

*Dark Altar

The Dark Altar is a special mechanic in the Valley of Wealth dungeon. Throughout the dungeon, players will encounter large stone slabs called Darkwells. One of these slabs will allow the player to offer 1,000 gold in exchange for a Dark Offering. The Dark Offering has limited durability and begins decaying immediately after being obtained, so players must move quickly. The closer the Darkwell is to the Dark Altar, the faster the Dark Offering will decay. With the offering, players can head to the rooftop of the dungeon and fight waves of enemies. From there, a cannon can be used to reach a hidden section of the map with stronger enemies.

At the far end of this area is the Dark Altar, marked by a dark brown pyramid. Placing the offering on the altar begins a ritual where players must defeat multiple enemies. Completing the ritual rewards 3,000 gold. Please note: altogether, you only receive 2,000 gold, as you need to subtract the 1,000 gold offering you made to the Darkwell. If the Dark Altar is empowered before entering the dungeon (by using Soul Essence), completing the ritual will also grant a Valley of Wealth Relic in addition to the gold, with a chance for a Doomed Legion or Burning Devotion Relic instead.

==== Enemies ====
*Rubble Lizards
*Drybone Lackeys
*Lord's Apprentices
*Tombguards
*Praetorians
*Shieldguards
*Undying Lictors
*Royal Archers

=== Temple of Semkaris ===
To get to this place, the player first needs to reach level 15 in the Valley of Wealth dungeon. Then the player has to find the Temple of Semkaris in the Old Kingdom. This temple is a medium level dungeon.

[[File:Temple of Semkaris Map.png|300px|thumb|Unnoficial map made by Hammy/Dungeon Cartografer on Discord.]]

==== Challenges ====
:Symbol Dial Puzzle

The concept of the puzzle is the same as in Valley of Wealth. The only difference here is that all 4 symbols are also located in the same room as the dials: the 4 dials are in the middle, and each symbol is behind one of the 4 pillars surrounding it. Usually, it is fastest to look at 2 of these symbols while running towards the center, and quickly rotate the other 2 dials to finish the puzzle.

:Crystal Puzzle

The Crystal Puzzle also works identically as in Valley of Wealth, with one small variation: Temple of Semkaris only has 3 crystals, instead of 4. The Crystal Heart is located directly across the inner section of the dungeon, but it requires a little parkour to access.

:Dark Altar

The Dark Altar functions as in the Valley of Wealth. However, on completing an empowered ritual, with multiple enemies of level 30, the default relic given is a Temple of Semkaris Relic, and there is also a chance to obtain a Lost Order Relic. The Dark Altar is on the exact opposite side of the map from the portal, being a part of the outer section.

==== Enemies ====
*Rubble Lizards
*Drybone Lackeys
*Lord's Apprentices
*Tombguards
*Praetorians
*Shrikeback Turtles
*Royal Archers

=== Sundered City ===
To get to this place, the player first needs to reach level 15 in the Temple of Semkaris dungeon. Then the player has to find the Sundered City in the Old Kingdom. There are very few health potions in this dungeon, and the enemies are high-level in the game, so this is classified as a hard dungeon.

[[File:Sundered City Map.png|300px|thumb|Unnoficial map made by Hammy/Dungeon Cartografer on Discord.]]

==== Challenges ====
:Symbol Dial Puzzle

The concept of the puzzle is the same as in Valley of Wealth, near the spawn. The only difference here is that all 4 symbols are farther than Valley of Wealth, making it slower to brute force.

:Crystal Puzzle

The Crystal Puzzle also works identically as in Valley of Wealth, with 4 crystals. The Crystal Heart is located near the spawn. The reward is 1500 coins.

:Dark Altar

The Dark Altar once again functions as in the Valley of Wealth. However, on completing an empowered ritual, the default relic given is a Sundered City Relic, and there is also a chance to obtain a Lost Order Relic. The Dark Altar is on the opposite side of the map from the portal, being deep in the back section.

==== Enemies ====
*Rubble Lizards
*Drybone Lackeys
*Royal Archers
*Rattleblades
*Tombguards
*Praetorians
*Lord’s Apprentices

=== Palace of Kings ===
To get to this place, the player first needs to reach level 15 in the Sundered City dungeon. Then the player has to find the Palace of Kings in the Old Kingdom. This dungeon has the Nightmare difficulty.

[[File:Palace of Kings Map.png|300px|thumb|Unnoficial map made by Hammy/Dungeon Cartografer on Discord.]]

==== Challenges ====
:Symbol Dial Puzzle

For the Palace of Kings, the Symbol Dial Puzzle is once again unique. The 4 symbols are all next to each other, and the hoard, and you have to look for the dials themselves, so be sure to memorize the symbols. The dials are in the higher parts of the map: one left of spawn, one right, and the other two are just slightly further into the dungeon, with one on each side.

:Crystal Puzzle

The Crystal Puzzle also has 4 possible Crystal Hearts, but the heart is trivial to access; it’s right down a hole located in the middle of the map. Each crystal’s respective area is only accessible via a cannon (except for the green crystal. Orange and blue crystals also have an alternative route that avoids the cannon but is much harder). Another large change is that it now gives 2500 coins instead of 1200.

:Dark Altar

In Palace of Kings, we have our first larger change to the Dark Altar mechanic: each Darkwell now requires a sacrifice of 1,500 gold, and the Dark Altar rewards 4,500, giving 3000 coins. The default relic is the Palace of Kings Relic, with no new special relic yet known. It is in a big room with small spikes and praetorians of level 50, acessible through a vault.

==== Enemies ====
*Drybone Lackeys
*Royal Archers
*Rattleblades
*Tombguards
*Rubble Lizards
*Praetorians
*Stubborn Sentries

=== Dread Pass ===
The Dread Pass is the hardest dungeon. To unlock it, you need to get to level 15 in the Palace of Kings dungeon. Then the player has to find the Dread Pass in the old kingdom. The Dread Pass has the Impossible difficulty.

==== Challenges ====

* Symbol Dial Puzzle

The symbol puzzle continues to be unique with the Dread Pass. The most notable change is that there are 6 symbols and 6 dials, instead of the previous 4. They are all located in a large hall with the gold hoard and a darkwell. The reward has also been increased to 1500 gold. The hall is located on the left path, near a different gold hoard.

* Crystal Puzzle

The Crystal Puzzle is similar to the Palace of Kings. There are still 4 crystals. Green and purple are located mildly deep into the dungeon, and blue and orange are located deeper into the dungeon. The heart itself is located in a room just off the left path, not far into the dungeon. The reward is still 2500 gold.

* Dark Altar

The dark altar is located at the top of the dungeon, in a room that has big stones and enemies with level 60. The Darkwell cost remains the same as the Palace of Kings (1500 for the Darkwell, the reward of 4500, also giving 3000 coins). The default relic is the
Dread Pass relic, without a new relic added.

==== Enemies ====
* Lost Delvers
* Lord's Apprentice
* Praetorian
* Royal Archer
* Undying Lictor
* Tombguard
* Shieldguard
* Rattlebone
* Rubble Lizard
* Stubborn Sentries
