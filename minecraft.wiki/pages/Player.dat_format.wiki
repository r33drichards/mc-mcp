{{exclusive|java}}

'''<player>.dat''' files are used by [[server]]s to store the state of individual [[player]]s. The format is also used within [[Java Edition level format#level.dat format|level.dat]] files to store the state of the [[singleplayer]] player, which overrides any <player>.dat files with the same name as the singleplayer player. These files are in [[NBT format]].

== NBT structure ==

Items are used both in the player's inventory and ender chest.

== Inventory slot numbers ==

The image below shows the slot numbers of the player's inventory slots as of [[Java Edition 1.21.5]].

In versions prior to [[Java Edition 25w03a|25w03a]] (including [[Java Edition 1.21.4|1.21.4]]), the head, chest, legs, feet, and offhand slots were stored in the Inventory tag. In 1.21.4 and most prior versions these slots are numbered 103, 102, 101, 100 and -106 respectively.

== Trivia ==
* Pre-1.7.10 player data files were named as the player's username rather than their UUID, this meant if the server was running on Windows and the player had a reserved filename as a player name they would not have their player data saved. List of Reserved Windows Filenames:
** <code>AUX</code>
** <code>COM<n></code> where n is a digit from 1-9 (inclusive)
** <code>CON</code>
** <code>LPT<n></code> where n is a digit from 1-9 (inclusive)
** <code>NUL</code>
** <code>PRN</code>
