A '''tundra''' is a  removed snow-covered [[biome]] which the precursor of the current [[snowy plains]], but with fewer trees and no [[tall grass]]. Tundras existed in the game prior to the [[Adventure Update]] (Beta 1.8 for ''[[Java Edition]]'') or in versions before Alpha 0.9.0 for  ''[[Pocket Edition]]''.

== Description ==
All [[grass block]]s are covered in [[Snow|top snow]]. The terrain is barren and has few oak [[tree]]s and [[dandelion]]s or poppies. [[Ice]] is commonly found over [[water]]. Snowfalls occur and is the [[weather]] of tundras. Tundras generate when the temperature is below 50% and rainfall is less than 20%. They can often be found near [[snowy taiga]]s, which have a higher rainfall value. They usually consist of low plains and gentle hills but in some cases, the terrain could be mountainous. [[Survival]] in this biome could be difficult, especially if the tundra is large as trees are rare. [[Chicken]]s, [[sheep]], [[cow]]s and [[pig]]s spawn in tundras.
