'''15w38a''' is the twenty-fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on September 16, 2015,<ref name="mojangblog">https://www.mojang.com/2015/09/minecraft-snapshot-15w38a/</ref> which adds skeleton horsemen.

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Skeleton Trap Revision 1.png|36px]] [[Skeleton horsemen]]'''
* Added "skeleton trap" horses. When a player approaches to within 10 blocks, the following happens:
** The <code>SkeletonTrap</code> flag is cleared.
** [[Lightning]] strikes the horse.
** The horse becomes skeletal if it isn't already.
** The horse becomes tamed.
** The horse becomes fully grown (if a baby) and the breeding cooldown is reset.
** A skeleton is spawned riding the horse.
*** If on Peaceful, the skeleton doesn't spawn, while the horse does.
*** The skeleton has [[Damage#Damage immunity|damage immunity]] for 3 seconds.
*** The skeleton doesn't despawn, since it has the tag <code>PersistenceRequired</code> set to true.
*** The skeleton is wearing an iron helmet, unless it randomly spawned with some other headgear.
*** The skeleton's bow and helmet are [[enchanted]] as if on an enchantment table at level 5–22.
**** The level is higher depending on [[regional difficulty]]; on Easy it is always a level-5 enchantment.
** Three additional skeletal horses with riders are spawned in the vicinity.

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* <code>SkeletonTrap</code> (byte): Indicates whether the horse is a skeleton trap (i.e. whether or not the horse will spawn 4 undead horsemen in its place when a player gets within 10 blocks of it).
** <code>/summon EntityHorse ~ ~1 ~10 {SkeletonTrap:1b}</code>.
* <code>SkeletonTrapTime</code> (integer), incremented each tick when <code>SkeletonTrap</code> is set to 1. The mob automatically de-spawns when it reaches 18000 (15 minutes). This will prevent the hostile horses from overflowing the world, similar to chicken jockeys.
** <code>/summon EntityHorse ~ ~1 ~10 {SkeletonTrap:1b,SkeletonTrapTime:17980}</code>.

'''[[Statistics]]'''
* Added "Times Slept in a Bed" (<code>stat.sleepInBed</code>) to track the amount of times a player has used a [[bed]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''All sloped [[rail]] types'''
* Hitbox heights are decreased from 10 pixels of block to about 2.5 pixels of a block.

'''Crops'''
* Improved drop chances for [[Wheat Seeds|seeds]] (average {{frac|1|5|7}} per crop harvested instead of {{frac|1|3|5}}), [[potato]]es and [[carrot]]s (average {{frac|2|5|7}} per crop harvested instead of {{frac|2|3|5}}), and [[beetroot seeds]] (average 2 per crop harvested instead of {{frac|4|5}}).

'''[[End rod]]'''
* The player can no longer step up onto an end rod as if it was a [[slab]] or [[stairs]].

'''[[Fire]]'''
* Goes out less often under the rain.
** The chance of going out each fire tick is reduced from 100% to 0–45%, depending on the <code>age</code> property.

=== Mobs ===
'''General'''
* Improvements to mob AI.

'''[[Skeleton]]s'''
* Have new idle sounds.
* Skeletons can now walk, strafe and shoot at the same time.
** They walk away from players that are too close and towards players that are too far.
*** They also sprint towards the player when very far away.
* Now can spawn riding "skeletal horses" through the new "skeleton trap" horse.

'''Tamed [[ocelot]]s & [[wolves]]'''
* Deaths (and killers) are now announced to their owners on [[chat]], even if unnamed.

'''[[Villager]]s'''
* Now pick up and plant [[beetroot seeds]].
* Now pick up [[beetroot]] and use it in the same way as they do [[carrot]]s and [[potato]]es.

=== Non-mob [[entities]] ===
'''[[Lightning]]'''
* Natural lightning strikes may spawn a "skeleton trap" style skeletal horses.
** Chance is calculated from the [[regional difficulty]] score: 5% * raw regional difficulty score.
*** 3.75–7.5% chance on Easy, 7.5–20% chance on Normal, 11.25–33.75% chance on Hard.
