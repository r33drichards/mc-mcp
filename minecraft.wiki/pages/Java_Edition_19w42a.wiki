'''19w42a''' is the tenth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.15]], released on October 16, 2019,<ref name="19w42a">{{snap|19w42a|October 16, 2019}}</ref> which makes [[slime block]]s and [[honey block]]s no longer stick together and fixes many rendering bugs, as well as several other bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>lectern_books</code> item tag.
** Contains [[written book]] and [[book and quill]].

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Dispenser]]s'''
* Now eject empty [[glass bottle]]s "properly" (likely not, due to {{bug|MC-114111}}) when not facing [[water]].
* [[Fire charge]]s launched from a dispenser now light [[campfire]]s.
* Can now place [[armor stand]]s.

'''[[Honey block]]s and [[slime block]]s'''
* No longer stick to each other.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Elytra]]'''
* Can now start gliding even rise in immediately after the jump up, not only during the descent after the jump.

=== General ===
'''Textures'''
* Removed wax block and crystallized honey textures.
