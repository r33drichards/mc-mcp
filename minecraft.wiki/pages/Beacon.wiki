A '''beacon''' is a [[block]] that can be placed in view of the [[sky]], on top of a pyramid made of valuable [[mineral]] blocks, to activate it. Once active, it projects a beam upward and can be {{Control|use|text=set}} to provide constant [[status effect]]s to all [[player]]s in a radius around it. A beacon's range and available effects depend on the size of its pyramid base, between one and four layers.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A beacon can be mined successfully by hand or with any [[tool]]. When destroyed by an [[explosion]], the block always drops as an [[item (entity)|item]].

== Usage ==
When "activated", beacon blocks provide two unique functions: 

* A landmark beam reaching into the sky which is visible from far away.
* Powers, which give players status effects within a certain range.

Additionally, {{in|bedrock}} beacons can also be [[waterlogged]].

=== Activation ===
[[File:Beacon multitype pyramid.webp|alt=The beacon base can be made of the different mineral blocks combined.|thumb|The beacon base can be made of the different mineral blocks combined.]]
In order to activate a beacon, the beacon must meet the following requirements:

* Beacons require an unobstructed view of the sky.<br> All the blocks that let light pass through (glass, water, leaves, slabs, etc.) and [[bedrock]] (the Nether ceiling) <!-- works in vanilla since 1.8.2, do not remove without reason --> are allowed.
* The beacon is on top of a pyramid constructed from [[iron block]]s, [[gold block]]s, [[emerald block]]s, [[diamond block]]s, and/or [[netherite block]]s. <br>
The type of block used is purely cosmetic, having no effect on the pyramid's power level or the range and strength of the [[status effect]]. A mixture of blocks of different types can also be used in any orientation, so long as they form a pyramid structure, like the ones listed below.

Status effect range can be improved by increasing the pyramid power level (see chart below). At level 4, the pyramid gives the option to increase the primary effect's strength to Level II in the beacon's GUI.

==== Pyramids ====
{{for|other pyramid structures|Pyramid}}
[[File:Beacon Pyramid.png|thumb|right|The four possible pyramid arrangements when using the beacon block. From left to right the pyramid structures decrease in complexity and strength.]]
Pyramids are the structures required to activate beacons. There are four possible pyramid heights. More pyramid levels make more powers available in a wider affected vicinity. The type of mineral block used to build the pyramid is entirely cosmetic and has no functional effect. Several different block types can be mixed without affecting functionality. If the pyramid is damaged so that the beacon deactivates, the previously-set powers resume their effects upon reactivation when the pyramid is repaired. This applies to [[piston]]-altered pyramids as well.

Multiple beacons can make use of the same specific mineral blocks below them. Combined pyramids do not need to be symmetrical. The image to the right shows a 6-beacon (2 by 3) pyramid. It requires a total of 244 mineral blocks, with a base layer of 10 by 11.

=== Beam ===
A vertical beam appears from a beacon if the beacon is activated, extending from the beacon block, up to height 2048. 

Horizontally, the beam is visible from any loaded chunk, which can be up to 512 blocks {{in|Java}} and 2048 blocks {{in|Bedrock}}.

==== Colors ====
The color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of [[stained glass]] or [[stained glass pane]]s anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as [[Dye#Color values|those for the corresponding dye]]. This also works using [[hardened stained glass]] and [[hardened stained glass pane]]s.{{only|bedrock|education}} Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks.

The resulting beam color can be found as <math>\vec{C} = \frac{1}{2^{n}}\left(\vec{c_0} + \sum_{i=1}^n{2^{i-1}\vec{c_i}}\right)</math> where <math>\vec{c_i}</math> is the sequence of glass colors (<math>\vec{c_0}</math> corresponds to the lowest block and <math>\vec{c_n}</math> to the highest one).

Beacon beams cannot go through most blocks, but can go through [[bedrock]] (to allow beacons to be used in [[the Nether]]) and [[end portal frame]]s.

{{Calculator|beaconColor}}

=== Powers ===
{{see also|Effect}}

[[File:Beacon GUI.png|thumb|right|The GUI shown when pressing {{control|use}} on the block.]]
Once the beacon is emitting a beam, it can then be ''fed'' one [[iron ingot]], [[gold ingot]], [[emerald]], [[diamond]], or [[netherite ingot]] to select the status effects given to players within range of the beacon. This is done through the beacon's GUI, displayed by pressing {{control|use}} while looking at the beacon block. It doesn't matter which of the items is fed into the beacon.

In the GUI, the player places the item to be fed in the empty slot and clicks an effect from the "Primary Power" section on the left. If the beacon is sitting on a 4-level pyramid, the "Secondary Power" section on the right also becomes active. The player can then choose either to turn on the [[Regeneration]] power in addition to the Primary Power or to raise the primary power to Level II. The user clicks the "Done" button (green checkmark), the item is consumed, and the power(s) become activated, with the outline of the effect on the [[HUD]] being blue. To change the beacon's powers, this process must be followed again, consuming another ingot or gem.

If the pyramid is broken, effects deactivate or weaken depending on the level of the pyramid that is no longer complete. Upon restoration of the pyramid, the originally selected power returns without the need to spend another item. If a smaller pyramid is upgraded, the effect range increases to that of the new pyramid without the need of reactivating it, however upgrading to level 4 does not modify the effect power (to increase the power, the player must use the beacon's GUI).

The five primary powers are: 
*{{EffectLink|Speed}} I: Increased movement speed.
*{{EffectLink|Haste}} I: Increased mining and attack speed.
*{{EffectLink|Resistance}} I: Decreased nearly all incoming damage (2-level pyramid required).
*{{EffectLink|Jump Boost}} I: Increased jumping distance and height (2-level pyramid required).
*{{EffectLink|Strength}} I: Increased melee damage (3-level pyramid required).

The secondary powers only available with a 4-level pyramid are:
*{{EffectLink|Regeneration}} I: Regenerates health.
*Increasing the primary power to level II.

{{IN|java}}, it is also possible to combine two different primary Level I powers:
*select a primary power in the left panel
*select the Level II option in the right panel
*select the second desired power back in the left panel
Only one of the two powers appears to be selected, although both effects are active.<ref>{{bug|MC-174630||Secondary beacon effect remains when switching primary effect}}</ref>

Every 4 seconds, the selected powers are applied with a duration of 9 seconds, plus 2 seconds per pyramid level, to all players in range. Thus, when powers are changed or a player travels outside the area of effect, the powers persist for 5–9 seconds, or 13–17 seconds with a full pyramid.

==== Range ====
The beacon affects an area in the shape of a square column, which reaches downward and out to each side at a range determined by the size of the pyramid base (see table below), and upward a distance of that range + the height of this dimension blocks.

The effect duration from the beacon is also determined by the size of the pyramid base (Pyramid size &times; 2 + 9).

The range of the beacon effect is limited by the simulation distance. As such, on simulation distance of 4 with a level 4 pyramid, the effect does not reach the chunks on the corners of the beacon range.

The distance from the player to the beacon block does not affect the intensity of the status effect.

=== Light source ===
Beacon blocks can function as light sources, emitting a light level 15. Like other [[light]] sources, they melt [[snow]] and [[ice]]. A beacon produces this light even when it doesn't emit a beam.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Beacons cannot be pushed nor pulled by [[piston]]s or [[sticky piston]]s.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Beam 12w38a.png|thumb|The map icon texture is hidden in the transparent part of the beacon beam texture in [[Java Edition 12w38a]].]]
*The texture of the beacon is 16×16 but renders only the 10×10 area in the center.
*It is possible to see the beacon beam on the bottom of an activated beacon.<ref>{{bug|MC-106124||Beacon beam appears on bottom of block|WF}}</ref>
*A fully powered beacon can fit within the upper level of the [[desert pyramid]] with the beacon’s beam perfectly being placed in the hole at the top.
