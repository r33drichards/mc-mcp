The adventures continue in the fifth official [[Minecraft]] chapter book based on the most popular video games of all time. When [[Po Chen|Po]], [[Morgan]], and three of their fellow Minecraft players track the [[Evoker King]] to his home in the heart of a perilous dungeon, they have to gear up for an epic fantasy quest filled with danger, dragons, and hostile mobs.
