== Generation ==
{{main|World generation#Features and structures}}

Features are generated for a given chunk after the terrain has been formed. When features are generated, they can spill over into neighboring chunks that have been previously generated. Thus, a tree at the edge of the generated world may be overwritten by a village before the player reaches it. It is also theoretically possible for two worlds generated with the same seed, from the same version of ''Minecraft'', to differ slightly depending on the players' travel routes, because the chunk generation order may determine which of two conflicting features overwrite or suppress the other.
