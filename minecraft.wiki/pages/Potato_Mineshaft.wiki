A '''potato mineshaft''' is a version of the [[mineshaft]] for the [[Potato dimension]] in the [[24w14potato]].

== Generation ==
Potato mineshafts generate below Y = 60 in all of the biomes in the [[Potato dimension]]. Because most of this dimension is empty, large portions of potato mineshafts hang over the void.

== Structure ==
Potato mineshafts are made up of blocks related to potato wood: [[Potato Planks|planks]], [[Potato Fence|fences]], and [[Potato Stem|stems]]. Instead of chains, they are held by [[potato pedicule]]s that connect them to the terrain above. [[Monster spawner]]s, which spawn [[cave spider]]s, generate in the same way as in regular mineshafts, surrounded by [[cobweb]]s.

Some terrain features, like clusters of [[ancient debris]] in [[wasteland]] [[biome]]s, can generate on the structure.

== Loot ==
This structure very rarely generates with [[minecart with chest]]s. These minecarts cannot spawn in "tunnels" hovering over the void, which usually make up over 90% of any given potato mineshaft. However they can spawn in the actual tunnels carving through the terrain. Loot in these rare chest minecarts is exactly the same as loot found in normal [[mineshaft]]s.
