<div class="treeview">
<onlyinclude>** {{nbt|list|minecraft:bees}}: A list of the entities currently in the beehive or bee nest. If present, this component will add text to the item's tooltip that says how many entries are in the list (e.g. if there are two entries, the tooltip will say "Bees: 2 / 3"). Despite the tooltip suggesting there is a maximum of 3 entries, there is no limit to the size of this component.
*** {{nbt|compound}}: A single entity.
**** {{nbt|compound|entity_data}}: Must include {{cd|id}} tag. If the {{cd|id}} is not {{cd|minecraft:bee}} then the entity will never leave the hive. The {{cd|Passengers}}, {{cd|Pos}}, {{cd|Rotation}}, and {{cd|UUID}} tags are ignored when the bee spawns (the bee will always spawn in front of the hive with a random UUID, facing south, and without any passengers).
***** See [[Entity format]].
**** {{nbt|int|min_ticks_in_hive}}: The minimum amount of time in ticks for this entity to stay in the hive.
**** {{nbt|int|ticks_in_hive}}: The amount of ticks the entity has stayed in the hive.<!--
