'''''Bureaucrap''''' is a game created by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Blockjam Bundle]] game jam.

== Gameplay ==

The player begins in a room with a hangman game board present on the wall. The board has as many underscores as the randomly picked word. The room has one exit, which leads to one of the many near-identical office rooms. Most of the rooms have four exits, leading to other rooms.

In the rooms, letters can be found, which can be used to complete the hangman game. Carrying a letter to the board makes it disappear, and reveals all the instances of the letter on the board, replacing the underscores. If the word is completed, the game resets with a new random word.

NPCs can be found in the office rooms. Interacting with them displays "Hello Person" above their heads.

=== Controls ===

The game is played with mouse and keyboard. While some controls are bound or can be bound to a controller, the game is not playable with a controller alone.
