'''1.21 Release Candidate 1''' (known as '''1.21-rc1''' in the [[launcher]]) is the first and only release candidate for [[Java Edition 1.21]], released on June 10, 2024,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-release-candidate-1|title=Minecraft 1.21 Release Candidate 1|date=June 10, 2024|website=Minecraft.net}}</ref> which reverts changes to [[Fire Protection]] and [[Blast Protection]] and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchantment]]s'''
* Changes to "Burning Time" reduction effect of [[Fire Protection]] and "Knockback Resistance" effect of [[Blast Protection]] in [[1.21-pre4]] have been reverted.
** The values are the same as in [[1.20.6]] except that these effects still stack from wearing multiple pieces.
** These two enchantments are expected to be rebalanced in the future.
