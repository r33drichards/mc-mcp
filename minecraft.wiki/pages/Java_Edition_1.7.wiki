'''1.7''' is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.7.2]], released on October 22, 2013.<ref>{{link|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20131022162644/https://mojang.com/2013/10/minecraft-1-7-the-update-that-changed-the-world/|title=Minecraft 1.7: The Update that Changed the World|website=Mojang.com via the Wayback Machine}}</ref> It adds acacia and dark oak [[planks]], [[Wooden Slab|slab]]s, and [[Wooden Stairs|stairs]] and re-textures the tops of most wood blocks.

The 1.7 pre-release was re-uploaded. The reupload of the server changed the language data file from Unix-style to Windows-style line endings. Changes to the client are unknown as the client JAR is [[Missing versions|lost]].
