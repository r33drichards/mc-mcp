The '''Server Test''' was an [[event server]] which was a limited-time server introduced in [[Bedrock Edition]], designed to trial experimental features, mini-games, and server mechanics. It served as a platform for testing [[multiplayer]] scalability and gathering community feedback to refine [[gameplay]] elements for broader implementation.<ref>{{ytl|zyQZWr2oreI|Minecraft Preview: Secret Server Test!|The Minecraft Architect|April 12, 2023}}</ref> The server reused the previously released [[Realms Celebration|Realms Celebration Map]] for its world.

== Main Event ==
=== Gameplay Features ===
The event focused on letting players try out new mini-games and challenges. These were special modes that weren’t available on regular servers, giving players a chance to experience something different and exciting.

=== Player Interaction ===
Players could work together, compete, and share their thoughts about the games. This feedback helped improve the features being tested, making them better for future use on other event servers.

=== Technical Testing ===
The event was to test how well the server could handle many players at the same time. Things like connection stability, speed, and gameplay performance were checked to see if everything worked as expected.
