The '''windswept forest''' or '''extreme hills plus trees''' is a more humid variant of the [[windswept hills]] biome filled with [[spruce]] and [[oak]] trees.

== Description ==
Windswept forests lack a stony terrain surface, but generate hilly and rugged terrain just like regular windswept hills. [[Tall Grass|Tall grass]] and both [[spruce]] and [[oak]] trees appear more often, forming a sparse forest, and [[Bush|bushes]] occasionally spawn in patches around the biome. [[Dandelion|Dandelions]] and [[Poppy|poppies]] are the only flowers that grow in windswept forests. This biome is one of the few to contain [[Emerald Ore|emerald ore]], and [[Coal Ore|coal ore]] along with [[Iron Ore|iron ore]] often generates exposed to sunlight. [[Infested Block|Infested stone]] with [[silverfish]] may also be found here underground. While the increased wood supply can be useful, the risk of fatal fall damage still exists, especially if this variant generates on the edge of a tall hill.  

[[Llama|Llamas]] inhabit windswept forests, along with the usual farm animals and [[hostile mobs]]. [[Pigs]], [[cows]] and [[chickens]] appear as cold variants here.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], windswept forests use a coolish humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which slightly fades the distance in an orange tint. Windswept forests have default atmospherics and lighting similar to temperate biomes, but coolish color grading tints the environment with a colder blue color.

Windswept forests generate instead of windswept hills in areas with high [[humidity]]. [[Taiga]]s, [[Snowy Taiga|snowy taigas]], [[Dark Forest|dark forests]], [[Windswept Hills|windswept hills]], [[Old Growth Pine Taiga|old growth pine taigas]], [[Old Growth Spruce Taiga|old growth spruce taigas]], [[Swamp|swamps]], [[Forest|forests]], [[birch forest]]s and [[Old Growth Birch Forest|old growth birch forests]] often border windswept forests, with rarer bordering biomes being [[Jungle|jungles]], [[Sparse Jungle|sparse jungles]], [[Bamboo Jungle|bamboo jungles]] and [[plains]]. A [[Lush Caves|lush cave]] may also generate under windswept forests due to its high humidity, but when the biome generates far inland, [[dripstone caves]] may generate beneath it instead.

== Mobs ==
The following mobs, excluding silverfish that spawn from infested blocks, naturally spawn here:
