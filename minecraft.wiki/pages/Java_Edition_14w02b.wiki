'''14w02b''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on January 9, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109163141/https://mojang.com/2014/01/minecraft-snapshot-14w02a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w02b|date=January 9, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref> to fix some of the bugs and crashes in the [[14w02a]] snapshot.

== Trivia ==
* 14w02b was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
* As with [[14w02a]] and [[14w02c]], this snapshot has the same protocol version as 1.7.6&ndash;1.7.10. Crossplay is therefore technically compatible between these versions but can cause issues.
