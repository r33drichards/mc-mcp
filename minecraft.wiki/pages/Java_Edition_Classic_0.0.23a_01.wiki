== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Controls]]'''
* Added a keymapping to control render distance.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A9:32:05 <08Notch> moving it to an F-key, though [...] well, I could just make it mappable..''" (14:32:05 UTC)</ref>
** Players can once again press {{key|F}} to toggle render distance.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "''A9:39:26 <CheeToS> yay, thank you for putting the f key back''" (14:39:26 UTC)</ref>

== Remake ==
{{main|Minecraft Classic (JavaScript remake)}}
To celebrate 10 years of ''Minecraft'', a JavaScript remake of this version was uploaded to the ''Minecraft'' website and made it possible to play multiplayer with up to 9 others through the browser. This version can be played at [https://classic.minecraft.net classic.minecraft.net] for free.<ref name="classic.minecraft.net">{{Mcnet|embrace-past-minecraft-classic|Embrace the Past with Minecraft Classic|May 7, 2019|Tom Stone}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* [[Notch]] planned to refactor the [[Version formats|version naming system]] after this version, removing the second zero and the "a", becoming the format "<''major version''>.<''release number''>[_<''patch number''>]". As an example, since this was the most recent version at the time, "0.0.23a_01" would be called "0.23_1" with such a system.<ref name=change/> However, this version was never actually given this name outside of this example.
** This format was also used somewhat in [[Java Edition Beta|Beta]].
* Despite being the last [[Multiplayer test]] version, [[Multiplayer]] is still accessible in late classic until it no longer functions in Indev.
