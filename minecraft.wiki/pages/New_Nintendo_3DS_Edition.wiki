'''''Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition''''' is a discontinued, heavily modified, and stripped down fork of ''[[Pocket Edition]]'' (though functionally its own edition) developed by [[Other Ocean Interactive]] and [[Mojang Studios]] for the {{w|New Nintendo 3DS|New Nintendo 3DS}}/{{w|New Nintendo 2DS XL|2DS}} systems, but was not compatible with the original {{w|Nintendo 3DS}}/{{w|Nintendo 2DS|2DS}} systems. It was released on the Nintendo eShop simultaneously in North America and Japan on September 13, 2017,<ref name="mc-website">{{Mcnet|minecraft-new-3ds|Minecraft on new 3DS!|September 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/13/16304978/minecraft-nintendo-3ds-release-date|title=Minecraft is out today for the New Nintendo 3DS|website=Polygon|author=Charlie Hall|date=September 13, 2017}}</ref> hours after its announcement during a {{wikipedia|Nintendo Direct}}, and later received a physical release only in North America on November 10, 2017.<ref name="noa" /> The game was digitally released in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand on September 20, 2018, one year and seven days after the original release.<ref>{{cite|url=https://nintendo.com/en-gb/Minecraft-New-Nintendo-3DS-Edition-1275925.html|title=Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition|date=July 27, 2018}}</ref> The internal name for this game is "Proteus".

As of 1.9.19, the ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'''s most recent feature update is the [[Discovery Update]].<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/articles/360022028351|title=Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition - 1.9}}</ref> It has not received newer feature updates, such as the [[Update Aquatic]], [[Village & Pillage]], [[Buzzy Bees]], the [[Nether Update]], and so on. It is one of the shortest-lived versions of ''Minecraft'', lasting 1 year, 4 months, and 3 days in NA/JP, or just 3 months and 27 days in Europe/AU/NZ, before receiving its final update on January 15th, 2019. Despite being stated to receive support for stereoscopic 3D "in a future update", such support was never added.<ref>[[Special:Diff/1147139|Talk page edit by HelenAngel]]</ref>

As of the shutdown of the Nintendo 3DS eShop on March 27, 2023, it is no longer possible to digitally purchase this version of the game, though the game can be redownloaded if it was previously purchased and physical copies still function normally.

== Development ==
The idea of ''[[Minecraft]]'' releasing on the {{wikipedia|Nintendo 3DS|3DS}} was first teased in June 2014 when {{wikipedia|Shigeru Miyamoto}} and [https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Shinya_Takahashi Shinya Takahashi] were asked about the possibility of ''Minecraft'' coming to the {{wikipedia|Wii U}}. Takahashi stated:
{{Quote|We've always thought internally that using the <nowiki>[Wii U]</nowiki> GamePad would probably make for a Minecraft that's very easy to play. And, of course, if we were to do something with Minecraft on the 3DS, similarly we would probably do it where it would be easier to play and could probably reach a lot of kids.<br />What's interesting is that, in Japan, Minecraft is not popular in the way it is in the U.S. and Europe, so we've also thought that, if we were able to do a partnership like that, it might bring opportunity to help make Minecraft more popular in Japan.|Shinya Takahashi|porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U<ref>{{cite|url=https://kotaku.com/what-nintendos-top-game-creators-think-of-minecraft-1593839008|title=What Nintendo's Top Game Creators Think Of Minecraft|author=Stephen Totilo|website=Kotaku|date=June 20, 2014}}</ref>}}
Minecraft on the 3DS was teased again at [[MINECON 2015]] when Mojang's COO stated: 
{{Quote|If I had my way, we'd be on everything. We want to continue to be available to all players, and that means being on new platforms because everyone uses something different.<br />I've never heard a reason why we haven't ended up on Wii U or 3DS. It just hasn't happened yet.|[[Vu Bui]]|porting ''Minecraft'' to the Wii U<ref>{{link|title=Minecraft Wii U: Mojang COO Teases That Nintendo Could Actually Still Get Minecraft|website=idigitaltimes.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701182636/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/minecraft-wii-u-mojang-coo-teases-nintendo-could-actually-still-get-minecraft-457794}}</ref>}}
The game was confirmed during a Nintendo Direct on September 13, 2017 and became available digitally shortly after the presentation.<ref>{{ytl|ztMGTTAjsAQ|Nintendo Direct 9.13.2017|Nintendo of America|Sep 13, 2017|t=7m10s}}</ref> A physical copy was released exclusively in North America a month later, on November 10, 2017.<ref>{{tweet|NintendoAmerica|924320074592333826|The adventure lives wherever you go with @Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition, available at stores on November 10th! bit.ly/2wNZ0nK|Oct 28, 2017}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
{{main|New Nintendo 3DS Edition exclusive features}}
''Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' had the following differences from other editions:
* ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' lacks online [[multiplayer]]. Instead it supports 2-player local multiplayer, which was added in update [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.4.23|1.4]].<ref name="mc-website" /> It does not use the Download Play app, requiring both players to own a full copy of ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition''.
** This makes this edition the third console version of ''Minecraft'' (alongside {{el|vita}} and {{el|ns}}) to allow players to play together without an Internet connection with one person per system.
* The game's save file is stored in "Extra Data" on the system's microSD card rather than as "Save Data" in the system's memory or on the Game Card.
* World types are "Default" and "[[Superflat|Flat]]". Default [[world size]]s are Small (672×672), Medium (1344×1344), and Large (2016×2016). The size of a world cannot be changed after it is created. The ratio of the [[Nether]] to the [[Overworld]] is 1:3.
** The medium and large sizes are larger than the {{el|wii}}'s world size of 864×864, despite the New Nintendo 3DS being a much less powerful console.
** This edition has a larger Nether area (672×672) and End area (2016×2016) than the {{el|xbone}} and the {{el|ps4}} world sizes of 640×640 in the Nether and the End.
* Although the height limit is only 128 blocks, worlds can be larger than the [[World size|Small]] world type from [[Legacy Console Edition]].
** There is no fall barrier at Y=-40 in the void, allowing the player to fall indefinitely.
* There was a [[spawn limit|mob cap]] that was much stricter than [[Legacy Console Edition]], where a maximum of 24 enemies, 24 animals, 16 [[squid]], and 16 [[villager]]s could exist at one time. However, there was initially no cap on [[Experience|experience orb]]s, so it was possible to crash the game by throwing too many [[bottles o' enchanting]]. This was fixed in update [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition 1.1.06|1.1]].
* Instead of including the [[map]] item, the map and the player's [[coordinates]] were displayed on the Touch Screen. Due to this, it was impossible to map [[The Nether]] in this version. The touch screen was also used for [[inventory]] management and [[crafting]]. The Woodland Mansion and Ocean Monument maps from update 1.9 were the only map items in the ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition''. They did not display the map in the player’s hand, but rather is held in the hotbar, and was displayed on the map in the touch screen.
* Due to the lack of an [[Dual wield|off-hand slot]] in this version, the [[totem of undying]] can be activated as long as it is in the player's hotbar (not necessarily in the player's hand).
* ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' targeted 60 frames per second in standard worlds and 30 frames per second in Mash-up worlds.
* Some early copies of the physical version had a misprinted amiibo logo on the box.<ref>https://x.com/__mcfacts__/status/1497628727383048194?s=46</ref>
* The render distance in ''New Nintendo 3DS Edition'' is 4 chunks, including 1 chunk of fog. It's possible to fully see the last chunk using a bug that disables fog.<ref>{{ytl|MwExs00trdw|t=2268|<nowiki>The Minecraft New Nintendo 3DS Experience | Bearman3600 [50,000 SUB SPECIAL]</nowiki>|Bearman3600|March 13, 2025}}</ref>

== Splashes ==
This edition included 20 platform-specific splash texts, oddly displayed directly below the logo and not slanted.<ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|908880941665406976|10 new splashes were added by the rad and mad @ablitter representing the flavor and in-jokes of Other Ocean. 10 were left up to me.|September 15, 2017}}</ref> 10 were selected by an Other Ocean engineer:<ref>{{tweet|ablitter|908882524348149760|Oh mine weren't in-jokes. Some of them are easily recognizable but others are *incredibly* obscure refs. Hoping fans will find them first ;)|September 15, 2017}}</ref>
* "A skeleton popped out!"
* "Casual gaming!"
* "Whoa, dude!"

Of the remaining 10, they were:<ref>{{tweet|TheMogMiner|908881672057311234|Of those 10|September 15, 2017}} (All splashes listed in the thread)</ref>
