Saves limits was a feature which existed in old versions of ''Java Edition'', where there was a limit to the number of worlds which could be saved.

In [[Minecraft Classic]], only 5 levels (worlds) could be saved online (except for 0.30 which worlds can also be saved offline) until 2012 where the Classic online saving servers where removed.

In [[Minecraft Indev]], only 5 levels (worlds) could be saved online expect for later Indev versions which worlds can be saved offline as well. The time when the online Indev saving stopped working is unknown.

From [[Java Edition Infdev 20100327|Infdev-20100327]] to [[Java Edition Beta 1.2_02|Beta 1.2_02]], only 5 worlds could be saved in [[Java Edition Alpha|Alpha]] save format (and [[Zone file format]]/[[Java Edition Infdev 20100624|Infdev-20100624]] level format) until [[Java Edition Beta 1.3|Beta 1.3]] which removed Alpha save format for Region file format which allows for infinite worlds.
