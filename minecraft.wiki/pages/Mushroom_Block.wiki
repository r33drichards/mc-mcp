A '''mushroom block''' is a solid [[block]] that makes up a [[huge mushroom]], which consists of a '''mushroom stem''' and '''brown mushroom blocks''' or '''red mushroom blocks''', depending on the color of the huge mushroom.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Mushroom blocks are most quickly broken with an [[axe]], with a chance of 77.77% of dropping 0 and respectively a chance of 11.11% to drop 1 or 2 [[mushroom]] items of the respective type. When mining a naturally generated [[huge mushroom]] structure, only the cap blocks drop mushroom items; the stem blocks drop nothing. [[Fortune]] does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.<ref>{{bug|MC-156657||Fortune doesn't work on mushroom blocks|Invalid}}</ref>

The blocks themselves can be retrieved only by using a [[tool]] enchanted with [[Silk Touch]]. Mining the mushroom cap or stem yields a block with the cap or stem texture, respectively, on all faces.

Additionally, {{in|java}}, if two similar mushroom blocks are placed next to each other and one of them is broken, the side of the other block that it was facing reveals the pore texture. This is because the side of these blocks change texture if they touch another block of the same type.

Mushroom blocks can be moved and are not broken by pistons.

=== Natural generation ===
{{main|Huge mushroom}}
Mushroom blocks generate as part of [[huge mushroom]] structures.

{{block distribution}}

=== Creative inventory ===
The brown and red mushroom blocks (with the cap texture on all faces) as well as the mushroom stem are available in the [[Creative inventory]].

=== Commands ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, commands can be used to obtain legacy variants of brown and red mushroom blocks with additional texture arrangements, including a block with the pore texture on all sides and 9 blocks with the cap texture on top, one or two cap textures on (adjacent) sides, and the pore texture on the remaining sides and bottom. The all-pores blocks, of which there are 4 distinct variants for each color, all look identical but retain the color and variant number distinctions internally (hence they do not stack together). If broken with a [[Silk Touch]] tool, all these variants drop cap blocks of the appropriate color. Otherwise, they have a chance of dropping mushroom items of the appropriate color.

== Usage ==
=== Composting ===
Mushroom blocks can be used in the [[composter]] with an 85% chance to make a new layer.

Mushroom stems can be used in the [[composter]] with a 65% chance to make a new layer.

=== Note Blocks ===
Mushroom blocks can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sound.

{{HistoryTable
|{{HistoryLine||June 14, 2011|link={{tweet|notch|80654817512525825}}|[[Notch]] showed a picture of a [[Java Edition Beta 1.7|Beta 1.7]] change-list. Although it was completely blurred out and was at first thought of as a joke, Notch later stated that one of the pictures with the new [[light]]ing system and the change list had a secret in them.
|One place where people discussed it was on the [https://www.minecraftforum.net Minecraft Forums], where it was discovered that the tabs at the top of the change list, which were partly covered, could be decoded based on the one-pixel tall pattern available in the image.<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/379958-</ref>
|After a user named "tmcaffeine" on the forums successfully decoded the image, the tabs read: ExperienceOrb.java, changelist.txt, Level.java, Tile.java, '''HugeMushroomTile'''.jav(a?), HugeMushroomFeature.(java?), RandomLevelSource(cut).<ref>https://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/380498-</ref>
|This led people to believe that huge mushrooms would be added, and indeed, later on, [[Notch]] revealed a screenshot on [[wikipedia:Google+|Google+]] in which two huge mushrooms could be seen as well as a [[village]].}}
