A version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''March 30, 2010''', at 12:03 UTC.<ref>[[wordofnotch:484051625|"Infdev's been updated, bugs have been fixed"]] – [[The Word of Notch]], March 30, 2010</ref>

== Changes == 
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Furnace (S) JE1.png; Lit Furnace (S) JE1.png|32px}} [[Furnace]]'''
* The smelting time of furnaces has been increased from 4 seconds to 8 seconds.

== Technical ==
'''Level format'''
* {{nbt|byte|TerrainPopulated}} tag
** Set to 1 if the chunk is populated (trees and ores have been generated).
** Chunks generated during inf-20100327 do not have this tag, so they generate new trees and ores.
** This fixes the bug causing trees and ores to regenerate under the right conditions.

== Fixes ==
'''5 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed a bug which caused the contents of containers (i.e. [[chest]]s and [[furnace]]s) to sometimes not be saved.
* Fixed the broken lighting on [[slab]]s.
* The top of the world is no longer fully lit, and it no longer temporarily hangs the game while mass updating lighting.{{verify|edition=java|type=change|The light bug has been confirmed but the crashes may never have occured in 20100327 (as mentioned in the verify on that page) and so if they never occured then this would not have been fixed.}}
* Fixed a bug that caused [[tree]]s and [[ore]]s to regenerate if the world was reloaded.
* Blocks no longer keep their data value when being broken, which was resulted in newly-planted crops to take on the block data (and therefore growth stage) of block previously occupying that space.
