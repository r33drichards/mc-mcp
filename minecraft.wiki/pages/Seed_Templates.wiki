[[File:Ore UI - Create New World Screen "Advanced" Tab Settings - Templates Button - Seed Templates Screen Menu (Bedrock).png|thumb|The seed templates]]
The '''seed templates''' is an interface {{in|bedrock|lc=}} that allows the player to choose from a number of preset [[Seed (world generation)|seeds]] for generating worlds with specific features or landscapes near the [[world spawn]]. There are 25 different seed templates.

== Usage ==
To get to the seed template interface, from the "Worlds" tab in the [[play screen]], select "[[Create New World]]" twice. Go to the "Advanced" section, and next to the "Seed" input field, there is an button named "Templates". Clicking on this button opens the seed templates screen. This screen shows a scroll-able region of named thumbnails to browse the preset seeds. Clicking on a thumbnail returns to the "Create New World" page with the applicable seed filled in.

Seed templates are only accessible with an Intenet connection, even though world creation does not require this.

== Templates ==
In the table below, the spawn point is not always the same every time a world is generated, varying by a few blocks in any direction.

<!--    ---- Missing Seeds ----
"some seed still not listed here, such as surface dungeon in forest near spawn" -->

{{info needed section|Several old seeds are missing.}}

Seeds in the seed templates are discontinued when changes in the world generating algorithms cause the seed to appear differently.

Starting in [[Bedrock Edition 1.10.0]], strongholds have less chance of spawning under a village, and with [[Bedrock Edition 1.11.0]], generated structures such as villages and temples spawn at different locations from previous editions. Therefore, the stronghold near the spawn point disappeared from the "Stronghold Village" seed, and there is no longer a village nearby in most seeds that were named for a village.

In [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.40]], several seeds were removed in preparation for the [[Caves & Cliffs]] Part II update ([[Bedrock Edition 1.18.0]]), because they were made obsolete by the introduction of significant changes in the terrain generation algorithm.<ref>{{citation
