The '''Minecraft Wiki''' is an online encyclopedia that covers the ''Minecraft'' franchise and is maintained by the game's voluntary community.

== Description ==
{{see also|Minecraft Wiki:About|Minecraft Wiki:How to help}}

The Minecraft Wiki runs on the [[wikipedia:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]] software, also used by Wikipedia and many other large [[wikipedia:wiki|wikis]]. The content on the Minecraft Wiki is created by volunteers, and almost all pages are open to be edited by anyone. There are also several administrators with certain capabilities such as being able to delete pages, but otherwise behave like other editors.

Recent edits on the wiki are shown in the [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent Changes]] page, where they can be reviewed and corrected if necessary. Every edit to a page is also listed in its "History" view (accessible under the dropdown next to the "Edit" or "View source" button on desktop view).

Content on the wiki is divided into different "namespaces", which are specified as prefixes in the page title. Articles about ''[[Minecraft]]'' are in the "default namespace" and do not have any prefix, while ''[[Minecraft Dungeons]]'' articles are in a separate namespace and have a "Dungeons:" prefix, and ''[[Minecraft Legends]]'' and ''[[A Minecraft Movie]]'' similarly have their own namespace and prefix. Many other namespaces are "behind the scenes" and do not directly serve content to readers, including "File", containing all of the images, audio and other files uploaded to the wiki; "Template", containing code that allows complex content to be more added and modified on articles; and "Category", which allows pages to be organized into categories.

Every page also has an attached "Talk:" page for discussion on that particular page. This allows wiki editors to participate in discussions without having to use a different platform, and for past discussions to be searchable on the wiki itself. The majority of larger decisions are reached through community discussion rather than being decided by a single administrator or editor.

== History ==
{{for|more detailed history about the wiki's internal processes|Minecraft Wiki:History}}

The Minecraft Wiki was founded on June 17, 2009, by [[User:Citricsquid|citricsquid]] (Samuel Ryan, a British student who got to know Minecraft during his last school year in May 2009), who also created the [[Minecraft Forum]]. It was originally named ''Minepedia'' and hosted at <nowiki>http://minecraftwiki.net</nowiki>. In August 2009, the wiki went offline for three weeks due to a lack of financial resources for hosting. With financial support provided by community member [[User:Andrewgodwin|aera]], the wiki came back online on August 28, 2009. After this, the wiki has been growing quickly along with the growth of ''Minecraft'' itself, doubling in visitors every month.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407065746/http://rmbls.net/post/16577257153/history-of-minecraftforumnet-and|title=History of minecraftforum.net and minecraftwiki.net|date=January 27, 2012|author=citricsquid|website=rmbls.net}}</ref>

On August 19, 2010, a backup failure caused edits since August 3, 2010 to be lost, resulting in discussions about a new hosting plan. Despite hardware update attempts and the creation of a legal entity ([[Redstone Wire Ltd]]) to handle finances, the wiki continued to suffer from performance issues. Around the same time, a company called ''Curse Inc.'' approached ''Redstone Wire Ltd'' about acquiring the wiki and forums. On November 15, 2010, the offer was closed, and since then, both have been owned by Curse. 

In December 2010, Minepedia was forced to rename to the Minecraft Wiki due to legal issues.

In August 2013, Curse migrated the Minecraft Wiki over to its new wiki farm, "Gamepedia", where other gaming-related wikis were hosted. Besides some technical changes, this also meant that the wiki URL changed from <nowiki>http://minecraftwiki.net</nowiki> to <nowiki>http://minecraft.gamepedia.com</nowiki>.

On August 26, 2016, Curse was acquired by Amazon through its subsidiary "Twitch Interactive", introducing new forms of advertisements. On November 24, 2017, Minecraft Wiki was moved to [[wikipedia:Amazon Web Services|Amazon Web Services]].

In June 2018, the wiki's [[Minecraft Wiki:Discord|Discord server]] was launched.

On December 12, 2018, it was announced that Fandom acquired Gamepedia, including the Minecraft Wiki.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://community.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:Brandon_Rhea/Fandom_and_Curse_Media_are_joining_forces|title=Fandom and Curse Media are joining forces|author=Brandon Rhea|website=Fandom Community Central|date=December 12, 2018}}</ref> While Gamepedia initially stayed a separate part of Fandom, over time it was fully incorporated into Fandom. This included, among other changes, a new layout for the wiki, disabling of anonymous editing, as well as the new URL <nowiki>https://minecraft.fandom.com</nowiki>.

On September 24, 2023, after growing frustrations with the Fandom platform, the wiki completed its process of [[Minecraft Wiki:Moving from Fandom|moving from Fandom]] and is now hosted independently at https://minecraft.wiki by Weird Gloop, with the old Fandom wiki now deprecated. The move also re-introduced a skin similar to the one used on Gamepedia, re-enabled anonymous editing, and introduced a new logo. On September 13, 2024, [[meta:Block & Quill Ltd|Block & Quill Ltd]], a new legal entity responsible for operating the Minecraft Wiki, was founded.
