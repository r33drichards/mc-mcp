'''Randy Peters''' is a character appearing in [[Randy Peters Minecraft advertisements|infomercials]], made to promote various ''Minecraft'' products and collaborations.

== Appearance ==
Randy Peters is a light skinned, older man with a bald head and white beard. In most of his appearances, he is depicted with a light blue buttoned shirt, beige pants, and black office shoes. However, he can occasionally be seen in different outfits, wearing a brown jacket and necktie in ''CROCHET ALL DAY'', and sunglasses in PEZ THE MIC.

== Personality ==
A parody of infomercial personalities such as [[w:Billy Mays|Billy Mays]], Randy Peters is very excitable and loud in his delivery. His job is to promote various products released under the ''Minecraft'' brand, often explaining the creative process behind them, such as the use of "Enjoyecules." However, the videos' [[Editor (character)|editor]] repeatedly sheds doubt on these claims, insinuating that they are merely hyperbolic jokes and commercial speak used to hype the products. In spite of this, Randy is also shown to have a compassionate side, using his show to support a man named Wayne Wheeler and gifting him the complete collection of [[Minecraft x The Woobles|Minecraft Woobles]].

Unlike others his age, Randy also appears to be quite knowledgeable on slang and encouraging trends. At the beginning of ''CANT.STOP.BRUSHING'', he acknowledges many contemporary slang terms, such as cringe, bet, and shrub. In ''LOSE THE SPOON'', he is also encouraging of [[Cool Cat]]'s interest in skateboarding, telling them to "shred that gnar," which apparently required a stunt double. This is taken to the extreme in PEZ THE MIC, which is almost entirely comprised of an extended rap number about the ''Minecraft'' branded ''PEZ'' dispensers, complete with name drops of [[Steve]] and [[Alex]] adjoined with slang.
