'''Leather horse armor''' is the weakest [[tier]] of [[horse armor]]. It is the only type that is [[craftable]]. Similarly to [[leather armor]], leather horse armor can be [[dye]]d and protects the wearer from [[freezing]].

=== Trading ===

== Usage ==
Only regular adult [[horse]]s and [[zombie horse]]s can wear leather horse armor; baby horses, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s and [[skeleton horse]]s cannot be equipped with armor.

=== Equipping ===
Leather horse armor can be equipped to a horse either by manually placing it in its respective slot ({{SlotSprite|Horse Armor}}) in the horse’s inventory, or by pressing [[control|Use]] on the horse while holding it.

The leather horse armor can be removed either by manually removing it from the armor slot or by using [[shears]] on the horse.

=== Protection ===
When equipped, leather horse armor gives {{armor|3}} [[armor point]]s.

Leather horse armor protects horses from freezing in [[powder snow]], but it does not negate other powder snow effects (e.g. falling through, inability to jump).

Horse armor prevents [[zombie horses]] from burning in sunlight.

If a horse dies while equipped with leather horse armor, it drops its normal loot and the horse armor.

=== Durability ===
Unlike player armor or wolf armor, horse armor does not have [[durability]]. This means a single leather horse armor can be used infinitely unless it is destroyed through other means.

=== Enchanting ===
Unlike [[Armor|player armor]], horse armor cannot be enchanted in Survival mode. However, {{in|java}} Creative mode, horse armor can be used with an [[anvil]] to enchant with [[Thorns]], [[Feather Falling]], [[Protection]], [[Fire Protection]], [[Projectile Protection]], [[Blast Protection]], [[Curse of Binding]], and [[Curse of Vanishing]]. Other enchantments can be applied, but they have no effect.

=== Dyeing ===
{{main|Dyeing#Dyeing armor}}Leather horse armor can be dyed by combining it with [[dye]](s) through crafting{{only|je|short=1}} or by {{control|using}} it on a [[cauldron]] containing dyed water.{{only|be|short=1}} {{control|Using}} leather horse armor on a cauldron containing ordinary water removes any dye from it.
