'''Performance metrics''' are timed recordings that report the game's performance in various measurements. They report [[tick]] durations, memory heap sizes, event loops, rendering statistics, and other information.

The number and details about which metrics are recorded is not solidified, and may be subject to change between versions.

== Generating the log ==
Pressing {{key|F3+L}} begins the debug log process. The process defaults to 10 seconds, but may be stopped at any time by pressing {{key|F3+L}} again.
