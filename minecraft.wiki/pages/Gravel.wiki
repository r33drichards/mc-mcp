'''Gravel''' is a gravity-affected [[block]] found in the [[Overworld]] and [[the Nether]]. It is a source of [[flint]], which has a chance to drop when gravel is broken.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
The suitable tool to break gravel is [[shovel]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Gravel|Shovel}}
When destroyed using a tool without [[Silk Touch]], gravel has a 10% chance to drop [[flint]] if this tool isn't enchanted with [[Fortune]]; It has a 14.2857……% ({{frac|1|7}}) to drop flint if the tool is enchanted with Fortune I, 25% for Fortune II, and 100% for Fortune III. If the flint is not dropped, gravel drops itself instead. <ref>{{bug|MC-94860||Fortune 3 shovel does not drop gravel|Duplicate}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-44744||Fortune 3 in a pickaxe on gravel only drops flint|WAI}}</ref><br>
Gravel drops itself when destroyed using a tool with Silk Touch.

=== Natural generation ===
Gravel is generated in [[disk]]s in [[river]]s, shallow oceans and small pools of water; in [[windswept gravelly hills]] biomes covering most of the surface; underwater covering the bottom of sufficiently deep rivers and normal, cold, and frozen [[ocean]] biomes, as well as their deep variants; and in the form of [[strip]]s in [[stony shore]]s.

Gravel can generate in the [[Overworld]] in the form of [[ore feature]]s. Gravel attempts to generate 14 times per [[chunk]] in ore features of size 0-160, at all [[altitude|level]]s and in all biomes. It can replace [[stone]], [[granite]], [[andesite]], [[diorite]], polished granite{{only|be|short=1}}, polished andesite{{only|be|short=1}}, polished diorite{{only|be|short=1}}, [[tuff]]{{only|je|short=1}}, and [[deepslate]]{{only|je|short=1}}.

Gravel can also generate as part of cold [[ocean ruins]], some warm ocean ruins, and in [[trail ruins]].

In [[the Nether]], gravel generates naturally in layers along the shores of the [[lava sea]], in all biomes except [[Crimson Forest|crimson]] and [[warped forest]]s. The layers are one block deep in [[Nether wastes]], and 3-5 blocks deep in [[soul sand valley]] and [[basalt deltas]].

Ore features of gravel in the Nether attempt to replace [[netherrack]] 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-160, from levels 5 to 41{{only|java|short=1}} or 36{{only|bedrock|short=1}}, in all Nether biomes except [[basalt deltas]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding gravel always drops the block upon death.

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s may [[barter]] 8-16 gravel with a chance of ~8.53% ({{frac|40|469}}) when given a [[gold ingot]].

== Usage ==
=== Falling Block ===
{{main|Falling Block}}
If the supporting block below a block of gravel is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the gravel block turns into a "falling block" [[entity]], which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity is available in the main article listed above.

When gravel falls on a player or mob, it can result in suffocation inside gravel until the destruction of the block, or moving out of it, or dying. If falling gravel lands in a space occupied by a non-solid block (such as [[torch]]es, [[rail]]s, or [[redstone dust]]) or non-full block (such as [[slab]]s or [[soul sand]]<ref>{{bug|MC-77079|||WAI}}</ref>), it breaks, then drops itself and never drops flint.<ref>{{bug|MC-118095||Dropping gravel on a torch never yields flint}}</ref><ref>{{bug|MCPE-120366||Gravel never drops flint when falling on a non-solid block. (such as a torch)}}</ref>

Gravel can be placed on a non-solid block without falling.

=== Bamboo ===
[[Bamboo]] can be placed and grown on gravel.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Note blocks ===
Gravel can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce snare drum sounds.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* Explosions launch falling gravel.
* If a player stands on a stack of sand or gravel and the stack falls onto a non-solid block, the player can fall fast enough to take damage or even die.
* Gravel often falls into caves, making a mock dead end. If a player encounters a gravel dead-end while mining, removing the gravel may reveal additional passageways.
