'''Muddy mangrove roots''' are a decorative variant of [[mangrove roots]] with [[dirt]]-like properties.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Muddy mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using a [[shovel]] speeds up the process. They have the highest [[hardness]] value of all blocks having the shovel as the suitable tool.

Muddy mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.

=== Natural generation ===
Muddy mangrove roots naturally generate in [[mangrove swamp]]s where [[mud]] blocks intersect with normal [[mangrove roots]] at the bottom of [[mangrove tree]]s. They can also generate in some entrance rooms of [[trial chambers]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding muddy mangrove roots drops the block upon death.

=== Crafting ===

}}

=== Post-generation ===
When a [[mangrove propagule]] grows into a tree, if the tree roots intersect with nearby mud blocks, those mud blocks are converted into muddy mangrove roots.

== Usage ==
Muddy mangrove roots are primarily used as decoration. They are orientable and can be rotated on any axis, facing perpendicular to whichever side of a block they are placed on.

=== Farming ===
Muddy mangrove roots have the ability to grow [[sapling]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[sweet berries]], and [[bamboo]], which can be planted directly on them under appropriate conditions. Saplings convert muddy mangrove roots into [[dirt]] when grown,{{only|be}} and [[azalea tree]]s grown on muddy mangrove roots convert them into [[rooted dirt]].
