A '''husk''' is a variant of [[zombie]] that spawns in [[desert]]s. They function similarly to zombies, except they do not burn in [[sun]]light, and they inflict [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] with their unarmed attacks.

== Spawning ==
Husks spawn at a light level of 0 in the [[desert]], mostly replacing zombies in these biomes.

{{IN|java}}, husks spawn directly under the sky in groups of 4 in place of 80% of all zombies and zombie villagers spawned in desert biomes.

{{IN|bedrock}}, husks spawn on the surface in groups of 2-4 in place of 70% of all zombies and zombie villagers spawned in desert biomes.<!--
Zombies weight in the desert (BE)
Husk weight: 240 (70.6%) 
Zombie weight: 95 (27.9%) 
Zombie villager weight: 5 (1.5%)
-->

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Camel husk jockeys ===
When spawning [[spawn cycle|naturally]], husks have a 10% chance to spawn as [[camel husk jockey]] if they spawn in a space that does not block the collision box required for a [[camel husk]]. This can only happen for up to one husk in each [[pack spawning|spawning pack]]. This can happen even when the husk spawns as a baby and was supposed to spawn as a [[chicken jockey]]. In that case, the chicken is spawned as a "jockey chicken" (i.e. it doesn't lay eggs and can despawn) but the husk spawns riding the camel husk instead.

=== Trial spawners ===
Husks have a {{frac|1|3}} chance to be selected as the "melee" mob for [[trial spawner]]s in [[trial chambers]].

=== Reinforcements ===
{{main|Zombie#Reinforcements 2|title1=Zombie § Reinforcements}}{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
On Hard [[difficulty]], all husks have a 0-10% chance to spawn other husks as reinforcements when receiving [[damage]] while targeting an [[entity]]. Additionally, up to 5% of husks spawn as leaders, getting a 50-75% boost to that chance. Just like for regular husk spawning, reinforcement husks can only spawn in places with direct sky exposure.

== Variants ==
=== Baby husks and jockeys ===
[[File:HuskAndBaby.png|thumb|Three adult husks and one baby husk.]]
[[File:Baby Husk Jockeys.png|thumb|All mobs that can be ridden by baby husks in Bedrock Edition.]]
{{IN|java}}, there is a 5% chance for husks to spawn as babies, and baby husks have a chance to spawn as a [[chicken jockey]].

{{IN|bedrock}}, 15% of naturally spawned baby husks can start riding a mob and become a jockey when it tries attacking a [[villager]], player, or [[golem]]. They can ride:
{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s

}}

Husks spawn with random values of [[knockback resistance]] between 0% and 5%.

=== Camel husk jockeys ===
Adult husks have a chance to spawn riding a [[camel husk]], along with a [[parched]], whilst holding an [[iron spear]].

=== Geared husks ===
{{Main|Geared mobs}}
Some husks spawn wearing [[armor]] or holding weapons, both of which may be [[enchant]]ed. In addition, husks may also spawn with the ability to pick up loot that is on the ground. The chances of each of these events occurring are listed below. If a husk spawns wearing multiple pieces of armor, the armor is never mismatched (i.e. all pieces are made of the same material). Husks cannot naturally spawn with [[netherite]] armor.

{{IN|java}}, the armor is not damaged by any damage source; it cannot "wear out" the way [[player]] armor does. Unlike other zombies, [[helmet]]s worn by husks do not break if the husk is exposed to daylight. {{IN|bedrock}}, any armor piece is damaged as if the player is wearing it.{{Verify|Does this happen in other editions, not including Java?}}

Husks also have a natural armor rating of {{armor|2}}, giving 1.6 to 8% damage reduction from [[Armor#Effects|most sources]]. Husks can also wear mob [[heads]], although they need to be dropped by the player before the husk can pick one up and put it on.

On {{w|Halloween}}, husks {{in|java}} may spawn wearing a [[carved pumpkin]] or [[jack o'lantern]]. They are never dropped, even when the husks are killed with [[Looting]].

camel_husk = Only if riding a [[camel husk]].
}}

=== Taken equipment ===
Any picked-up equipment has a 100% chance of dropping and drops with the same damage level it had when picked up.

=== Naturally-spawned equipment ===
Husks have an 8.5% chance of dropping their naturally-spawned equipment (other than Halloween pumpkins), with random durability. Each level of [[Looting]] increases the chance 1 percentage point (11.5% with Looting III). They cannot drop the [[diamond sword]]s that they occasionally wield during [[ominous trial]]s. These items include:
* {{ItemLink|Iron Shovel}}
* {{ItemLink|Iron Sword}}
* {{ItemLink|Iron Spear}} (sometimes [[enchanted]])
* {{ItemLink|Diamond Sword}} (in [[ominous trial]]s)
* {{ItemLink|Iron Chestplate|Random Armor|link=Armor}} (sometimes [[enchanted]], made from leather, gold, copper, chainmail, iron or diamond)

Additionally, {{in|bedrock}}, all naturally spawned equipment always drops at full durability when the husk converts to a zombie.

=== Experience ===
Adult husks drop {{xp|5}} and an additional {{xp|1|3}} per naturally-spawned equipment. Baby husks drop {{xp|12}}.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Husk becoming Zombie.gif|thumb|right|upright|A husk that drowns converts to a zombie (which can convert to a drowned).]]
Like zombies, husks are hostile toward the player, [[iron golem]]s, [[villager]]s, baby [[turtle]]s, and [[wandering trader]]s. They pursue these mobs on sight from up to 40 blocks away, as opposed to 16 blocks like most other hostile mobs. If any other mob attacks a husk on purpose, all other husks and zombie variants (except [[zombified piglin]]s) within a 67×67×21 to 111×111×21 area become hostile toward the attacker. They attempt to avoid obstacles, including sheer cliffs, water, and lava, and try to find the shortest path to the player.

{{anchor|Hunger effect}}Husks apply [[Hunger (effect)|Hunger]] to any player or mob they hit using a melee attack, unless the husk is holding an item in its main hand or the player blocks the attack with a [[shield]]. This effect lasts for 7 × floor ([[Difficulty#Regional difficulty|regional difficulty]]) seconds.

Husks are one of the few [[undead]] mobs that are immune to burning in sunlight, which allows them to stay around during the day.

Husks have a chance to spawn with the ability to break down [[door]]s on Hard [[difficulty]].

Husks seek out any nearby [[turtle egg]]s and trample them.

Husks can pick up [[item]]s if the game rule {{cd|mobGriefing}} is set to true, which prevents them from [[despawning]].

Husks attempt to avoid [[water]], only entering it when there is no other path to their target.

A husk that is fully submerged in water for 30 seconds begins converting to a normal [[zombie]], which takes an additional 15 seconds and cannot be stopped even if the husk leaves water. Once this process finishes, the zombie that it becomes has full health even if the husk has been damaged, and may further convert into a [[drowned]] if it remains submerged.

{{IN|Java}}, husks are never spawned as part of a [[zombie siege]], but if a husk naturally spawns nearby, it will join the siege and behave like all other zombies.

Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* Damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* Unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* Ignored by the [[wither]].
* Affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* Unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* A threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

=== Jockey ===
{{Exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
[[File:Baby Zombie Riding Husk.png|thumb|width=165x165|An unarmed husk ridden by a baby zombie]]
15% of nearby baby [[zombies]], [[husks]], or {{InUpcoming|bedrock 26.0}} [[zombie villagers]], [[drowned]], or [[zombified piglins]] may ride an adult husk to form a [[jockey]].
