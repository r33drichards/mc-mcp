'''{{PAGENAME}}''' is a [[Marketplace]] map made to promote various ''[[MINECON]]'' events.

== Summary ==
The map begins on a platform made of [[obsidian]] and [[white concrete]], with three paths to chose from. Before the player are two [[sign]]s, labeling an area as belonging to [[MINECON Earth 2018]] and instructing the player to collect all colors of [[wool]]. Below it a second level with a [[chest]]<ref group="note">Containing 64 oak planks, 4 pairs of [[elytra]], 3 [[beetroot seeds]], 3 [[melon seeds]], 3 [[pumpkin seeds]], 3 [[wheat seeds]], a lava bucket, a [[water bucket]], and a [[white bed]].</ref>. Next to the chest is a collection of signs labeling each color, as well as guidance from Jigarbov.

Climbing up [[ladders]] can return the player to the top of the platform, where they could also choose between two [[command block]]s. One is labeled Go to 2017, returning the player to an area based off ''[[MINECON Earth 2017]]'', where the player must collect [[concrete powder]], with a similar supply chest<ref group="note">Containing 4 pairs of [[elytra]], 3 [[beetroot seeds]], 3 [[melon seeds]], 3 [[pumpkin seeds]], 3 [[wheat seeds]], a lava bucket, a [[water bucket]], and a [[white bed]].</ref>. To the right is one labeled "Go to ???" which is a special posthumous area made after ''MINECON Earth'' was discontinued, with another supply chest<ref group="note">Containing 64 [[oak planks]], 4 pairs of [[elytra]], 3 [[beetroot seeds]], 3 [[melon seeds]], 3 [[pumpkin seeds]], 3 [[wheat seeds]], a lava bucket, a [[water bucket]], and a [[black bed]].</ref>. In order to reach the areas, the player must glide.

=== 2017 ===
The player glides right onto the top of a large [[Earth]], onto a [[plains]] [[biome]] with a [[Water lake|pond]], [[oak]] and [[birch]] [[tree]]s, and a large [[cave]]. A [[donkey]], [[cow]], [[pig]], and several [[zombified piglin]]s can be found. Hidden in the leaves of the oak tree is a chest<ref group="note">Containing 9 grass blocks, 3 oak saplings, 2 [[chicken]]  [[spawn egg]]s, and 2 [[rabbit]] spawn eggs.</ref>, and inside the cave is another chest.<ref group="note">Containing 9 [[short grass]], 2 [[oak fence]]s, 2 [[cow]] [[spawn egg]]s, 2 [[pig]] spawn eggs, and 2 [[sheep]] spawn eggs.</ref> Passing by [[Coal Ore|coal]], [[Gold Ore|gold]], and [[iron ore]]s, as well as lava, the player can delve into the cave. Inside, the first concrete powder, cyan, can be found in a chest, as well as a stack of [[dye]].

Nearby is a [[monster spawner]] spawning [[stray]]s, built into a patch of [[snow block]]s. Venturing downward the player will find [[end stone]] and [[netherrack]], with a zombified piglin spawner built into the latter. Above the spawner is another chest, in front of lava, however it can't be opened with how it's placed. Opening the chest reveals it holds the pink powder, however if the netherracking blocking it is removed lava will spill into the room. Beside the chest is a [[glowstone blob]], which leads into an intersection on a hole into the [[void]]. To the left is the chest for white powder, suspended over the void by [[dirt]]. To the right is a [[sandstone]] blob, with a [[husk]] spawner. Continuing past the blob is an out of reach chest covered in endstone, revealing the magneta powder when uncovered.

Returning to the surface, several more paths and secrets can be found. Going over to the pond where a donkey could be found, a hole can be discovered, leading to a [[Monster Room]]. Inside the chests are a collection of items,<ref group="note">Containing 8 [[sand]], 3 [[sugar cane]], and 3 [[water bottle]]s.</ref> and the blue powder. On the front side of the cube is a [[Nether wastes]] biome, with the gray powder hidden under [[soul sand]] growing [[Nether wart]]s. In order to reach the chest, the player can simply drop down from a ledge near a pond with ores. Hidden below, near the white chest, is a double chest containing Nether themed items, including [[Nether bricks]] and spawn eggs for [[blaze]]s, [[ghast]]s, [[wither skeleton]]s, and [[magma cube]]s.

On the left side of the cube is a [[desert]], with [[dark oak leaves]] serving as [[cacti]]. A [[desert well]] is visible from the top, identifiable by its fence posts. Dropping down to the well will reveal the inside is a room, containing the yellow chest, as well as a second.<ref group="note">Containing 9 [[grass block]]s, 3 [[acacia sapling]]s, 3 [[acacia slab]]s, 2 [[acacia log]]s, an [[acacia fence gate]], and a [[horse spawn egg]].</ref> Hidden behind a wall is the light gray powder, identifiable by the sounds of husks. Below the well is another chest, tied up to several floating sand blocks.<ref group="note">Containing 5 [[terracotta]], 5 [[yellow stained terracotta]], 3 [[red stained terracotta]], 3 [[red sand]], 2 [[rail]]s, and a [[powered rail]].</ref> On the back of the cube is a [[snowy plains]] biome, where strays will spawn from the inside. The light blue chest can be found frozen inside [[ice]]. On the right is [[the End]], with miniaturized [[end spike]]s and [[exit portal]]. On the pillar in the portal is a conspicuous block of coal, hinting at the location of the black powder. However, due to the surrounding bedrock, it can only be obtained by {{Control|breaking}} the chest. Similarly, inside an end spike is the orange powder (in this map becomes an [[eye armor trim]] in one of the spikes, and an empty [[shulker box]] in another one), reached by breaking an [[End crystal]] made of [[glowstone]] (now the chests are under the spikes).

Nearby the cube are several smaller, satellite cubes, containing additional items. Before the End side is a [[mycelium]] cube growing [[Huge mushroom|giant mushrooms]], with a chest containing the lime powder. Below the mycelium cube is a [[bamboo jungle]] in the shape of a branch, with a chest.<ref group="note">Containing 9 [[bamboo]], 5 [[jungle sapling]]s, 5 [[jungle leaves]], 2 [[cocoa beans]], 2 [[ocelot]] [[spawn eggs]], 2 [[panda]] spawn eggs, 2 [[parrot]] spawn eggs, and a [[wild armor trim]].</ref> The brown chest is at the bottom, hanging from a [[jungle log]]. To the left is a [[conduit]]-like planet with guardian spawners and a chest.<ref group="note">Containing 40 [[prismarine]], 25 [[prismarine bricks]], 11 [[sea lantern]]s, 5 [[wet sponge]]s, 4 [[guardian]] [[spawn egg]]s, 2 [[elder guardian]] spawn eggs, and 1 [[squid]] spawn egg.</ref> The final planet is themed after [[End cities]], with [[purpur block]] and [[end stone brick]] supports. Two chests can be found there, the more easily reachable being below a [[chorus plant]], containing [[dark forest]] blocks.<ref group="note">Containing 6 [[cobblestone]], 5 [[dark oak planks]], 4 [[dark oak sapling]]s, 4 [[grass block]]s, a [[red carpet]], a [[brown mushroom]], a [[red mushroom]], and a [[vindicator]] spawn egg.</ref> The purple powder chest can be found hidden below, identifiable by a [[purple stained glass]] block. Inside are the powder and dye, along with [[endermen]] and [[endermite]] spawn eggs.

The final powder, red, can be found underneath the starting platform, where a sign saying "something to do... Collect one of each color of any block" can be found. Behind the entirety of the experience is the logo for the convention, with [[creeper]]s and [[skeleton]]s on top. Behind the logo is an [[End portal]] missing a few [[eyes of ender]].

=== 2018 ===
The planet begins similarly to 2017's, with a plains biome. Instead of an empty field, however, is a collection of [[river]]s or [[lake]]s with a large house in the center. Before it are three [[villager]]s, a chicken, and a horse, with cow and pig spawners subtly integrated into scenery. Approaching the house, players can find a unique dark oak design with a hidden chest containing [[phantom]] spawn eggs, [[phantom membrane]]s, and a purple [[bed]], then climb up several [[wooden stairs]] up into two different entrances. Inside is a [[crafting table]], [[furnace]], a ladder up into a second floor, and [[stone brick stairs]] down into a basement. Climbing up to the top leads to a cramp cellar with no floors and two chests. The first contains the first wool, white, and second two cat spawn eggs, boarded up by a block of concrete.

The basement is more spacious, containing a small library with an enchanting table and several bookshelves. Below two of them are more chests, one containing a monster spawner, and the other the light gray. Beside the table is a birch door into a cramped room, with a white bed beside a bookshelf, a [[blue orchid]] in a [[flower pot]], and stained glass window. Beside the stairs is a [[brewing stand]], and beside it is a hole into a small tunnel made of [[stone bricks]]. Going past exposed dirt and iron ore, the player can find a monster room, leaking water.  Inside the room are two chests and a double chest, the first containing four ladders and an [[enchanted golden apple]], the second the purple wool and dye, and the third a wide variety of valuable items. These include [[golden apple]]s, [[diamond]]s, a [[saddle]], [[iron ingot]]s, [[iron nugget]]s, [[dragon's breath]], [[diamond horse armor]], and [[Music Disc 11|11]].

Swimming into the hole in the wall will lead to the left side of the cube, a coral reef swarming with [[cod]] and [[drowned]]. Swimming counter clockwise leads to a drowned spawner surrounded by [[magma block]]s and the blue wool chest. In the opposite direction is a conduit, with a chest full of [[prismarine bricks]]. Swimming farther will lead to soul sand, which propels entities up into a nook of a cave with a [[zombie]] spawner. Climbing up from there, the player can find a chest with the light blue wool, and exit through a waterfall behind the house. Above is the lime chest, hidden inside of a tree, with minor chests nearby hidden under a port and in a bush. The former contains [[turtle]] spawn eggs, [[turtle egg]]s, and [[scutes]], the latter saplings. Crossing over a bridge to a farm at the back of the cube, the player can find a Nether biome, identifiable by netherrack arches. Maunuvering down, the player can find a chest for the orange wool. Traversing down the player will discover a [[Nether fortress]].

Entering into the fortress, the player can find a zombified piglin spawner, and then a fork. One path will lead down a long hallway and appear to end at a dead end, but actually has an obscured higher level with a chest containing the magenta wool, protected by blazes. The opposing path leads to the opposite, a drop into a chamber containing as [[coral]], [[pufferfish]] spawn eggs, [[nautilus shell]]s, and a [[heart of the sea]]. A final chest can be found under the bridge leading into the structure, containing more aquatic items such as [[salmon]] spawn egg, [[sea pickle]]s and [[seagrass]].

A similar setup is present on the right side of the cube, set in both desert and [[badlands]] biomes. The badlands chest contains the green wool, identifiable by a nearby cactus. Two additional chests can be found in a river underneath, reachable by {{Control|swimming}}, in a creeper face shaped mound. The first contains drowned spawn eggs, more nautilus shells, and another heart of the sea, while the other contains the yellow wool. A desert pyramid leads to another catacomb, which can be accessed through either a sideways door or a hole in the front side of the cube. The doorway can be flown through using elytra with enough precision. 

If entered through the door, the player will discover a husk spawner, drop down into a hallway, and then drop down again to a [[spider]] spawner surrounded by [[cobweb]]s. At the end of the chamber is a chest containing cod spawn eggs, [[kelp]], and seagrass. Hidden above the hole entrance is a fourth floor, containing the pink wool. The rest of the front side is an [[old growth spruce taiga]], where the cyan wool can be found hidden behind a lake, identified by a [[pumpkin]] crop in front of it and stray spawner below it. Inside the tree beside it is the brown wool, while the red wool is hidden inside of a mountain covered in lava. However there does not appear to be a direct entrance, leaving it completely encased in [[stone]].{{Needs testing}} The black wool is even more obscured, being encased in sea lanterns close to the cyan wool.  

The gray wool can be found inside of a rock on the top of the cube, reachable by swimming. The only satellite in the area is a downsized [[pillager outpost]], with a [[pillager]] spawner inside. At the top is a chest containing illager centric items.<ref group="note">Containing [[crossbow]]s, pillager spawn eggs, [[allay]]s, [[fox]]es, and [[ravager]]s, as well as [[enchanted book]]s with [[Piercing]] and [[Multishot]].</ref> 

=== ??? ===
{{Missing information|Lapis ore location}}
Unlike the preceding area, there are four cubes of moderate size, not in the shape of Earth. Instead, the highest cube has a large [[Azalea tree|azalea]] on top, with a patch of moss underneath and a [[pale oak]] tree and a [[cherry]] tree. Also unlike the previous areas, the accompanying challenge is to locate [[deepslate ore]]s. Digging down into it reveals a [[lush caves]] biome. Slightly above a [[spring]] is a skeleton spawner, to the right, a [[zombie]] spawner, and inside the water, a [[drowned]] spawner and an [[axolotl]] spawner. Beside the latter in the water is a chest.<ref group="note">Containing 192 [[calcite]], 13 [[blocks of amethyst]], 5 [[budding amethyst]], 2 [[amethyst cluster]]s, 2 [[glow ink sac]]s, an enchanted book with [[Silk Touch]], and a [[goat]] spawn egg.</ref>

The final cube resembles a [[trial chamber]] and has a hanging [[decorated pot]] like building underground it. Inside the cube, four [[trial spawner]]s can been found (one of each of these mobs: [[breeze]], [[bogged]], [[husk]] and [[silverfish]]) with a chest in the middle containing trial Chamber themed items. Above the chest 4 [[vault]]s can been found. Inside the pot, the final chest can be found containing 4 different armor trims and 1 [[sniffer egg]].
