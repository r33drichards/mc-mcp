The first version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]'''<ref>{{ytl|bFigFw17hXg|Minecraft InfDev. Huge Temple Of Brick!|DRMB|February 27, 2010}}</ref> was released on '''February 27, 2010''', at 14:14 UTC.<ref name="maps">[[wordofnotch:415398931|"Here, try some infinite maps"]] – [[The Word of Notch]], February 27, 2010</ref> 

In order to test infinite world generation, the height limit was reduced and many parts of the game were temporarily removed, such as caves, ores, music, and mobs.

'''[[File:Golden Apple JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Golden Apple]]'''

=== World generation ===
{{see also|Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects}}
''' General '''
* Worlds can now generate infinitely.
** At X/Z +1,024/-512, the skybox around the world stops rendering, giving way to a blank light blue sky.
** At around X/Z ±65,536 blocks away, the hitbox begins to lose its shape.
** At X/Z ±131,072, the gaps between chunks begin to become jumpy and distorted. These effects begin to double every exponent of two that the player walks from here.
** At X/Z ±2,097,152, the effects become so severe that the world seems to not render completely at certain angles.
** At X/Z ±16,777,216, blocks are no longer solid, allowing the player to fall and hit a layer of lava, however the player can still swim through water.
** At X/Z ±2,147,483,647 (32-bit integer limit), terrain disappears completely and the game crashes.
* The terrain generates much like it did during [[Java Edition Classic|Classic]].
* The world now only generates grass, dirt, stone, water and dandelions for the terrain, and bricks and obsidian for generated structures.

'''[[File:Brick Pyramid.png|40px]] [[Brick Pyramid]]'''
* Generates at the exact same positions regardless of world seed.
* Top of it is cut off due to height limit change.

'''[[File:Eyc0bj7pr4w51.jpg|40px]] [[Java Edition Far Lands/Up to Infdev 20100325-1640|Far Lands]]'''
* As the world now generates infinitely (or at least to 32-bit integer limit), the world generation breaks at X/Z ±33,554,432, making all terrain go to maximum possible height.
* Are a giant wall of stone blocks that go from sea level to the height limit.

'''[[File:Obsidian Wall.png|40px]] [[Obsidian wall]]'''
* Generate at 0 on X and Z axes.
* Used to mark the center of a world.

=== General ===
'''[[Sky]]'''
* A 1536×1536 test skybox, which is completely blue (hex: {{color|#0000FF}}).

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* Blocks no longer update on their own.
** This means that sand and gravel do not fall, crops and saplings do not grow, sponges do not work, and liquids do not spread.

'''[[File:Gravel JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Gravel]]'''
* No longer generate in the map and is now unobtainable by normal means.

'''[[File:Sand JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Sand]]'''
* No longer generate in the map and is now unobtainable by normal means.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Apple JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Apple]]s'''
* Texture changed from [[File:Golden Helmet (item) JE1 BE1.png|32px]].
* Drops out after the death of players with a nickname Notch.

'''[[File:Painting JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Painting]]s'''
* Now crafted with [[stick]] instead of [[planks]].
{{Crafting table
|A1=Stick
|A2=Stick
|A3=Stick
|B1=Stick
|B2=Light Gray Cloth
|B3=Stick
|C1=Stick
|C2=Stick
|C3=Stick
|Output=Painting}}

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Hotbar]]'''
{{Hotbar
|Glass, 999
|Oak Planks, 990
}}
* The player now spawns with 999 [[glass]] and 990 [[planks]] in new worlds.

'''Map configuration'''
* [[Map theme]], [[map shape]], and [[map type]] no longer have any effect, as all Infdev maps are of the same type.

'''Level saving'''
* No longer functional, as saving a level produces an empty <samp>[[.mclevel]]</samp> file.

'''[[Creative]]'''
* Player can take damage

=== General ===
'''[[Height limit]]'''
* Changed world height from 256 to 128.

== Technical ==
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* "T" value no longer displays values.
** "O", "E", "B". and "I" values no longer function.
* Removed "L" lighting update value.

== Removals ==
=== Mobs===
'''[[File:Creeper JE3 BE1.png|32px]] [[Creeper]]s'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:Pig JE1.png|32px]] [[Pig]]s'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:White Sheep JE1.png|32px]] [[Sheep]]'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:Skeleton JE1.png|32px]] [[Skeleton]]s'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:Spider JE2 BE1.png|32px]] [[Spider]]s'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:Zombie JE1.png|32px]] [[Zombie]]s'''

=== World generation ===
'''[[Cave]]s'''
* Removed.

'''[[Ore]] generation'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:Starting House JE2.png|40px]] [[Starting House]]'''
* Removed.

'''[[File:Oak JE3.png|32px]] [[Tree]]s'''
* Removed.

'''[[World boundary]]'''
* Removed.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Daylight cycle]]'''
* Removed.

=== General===
'''Dynamic lighting'''
* Removed.

'''[[Music]]'''
* Removed.

=== Distance effects ===
* Entities (including the player) no longer use single-precision floating point arithmetic for positions.

== Bugs ==
'''7 bugs reported'''
* The [[player]] can place a [[block]] inside themselves.
* The skybox cuts off after a while.
* [[Chest]]s and [[furnaces]] crash the game when opened.
* Some blocks do not display their textures when placed (fire, gears, torches, crops). (They can still be selected however.)
* [[Furnace]]s do not have a face.
* [[Fire]] cannot be extinguished normally. Punching the fire instead punches the block behind it. Mining the block below it turns the fire invisible, though it is still there. Placing a block on the fire (replacing the fire with the block) removes the fire.
* [[Torch]]es cannot be placed on the sides of a block.

== Trivia ==
* An early developer screenshot showed this version marked as "[[Minecraft Indev]]".<ref>[[wordofnotch:414322017|Progress update on infinite maps]] – The Word of Notch, February 27, 2010</ref>
* This is the first time the world height was decreased.
