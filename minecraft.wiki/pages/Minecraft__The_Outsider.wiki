== Synopsis ==

[[Jeremy]] has never brewed a single [[potion]], but he knows what it’s like to be invisible. He lives in the biggest city in the [[Overworld]], surrounded by tall buildings, [[redstone]] wonders, and tons of people. So why does he feel so lonely? Why is it so hard to find a friend?

When Jeremy’s family meets a family from out in the wilderness, it looks like it’s going to be the same old story. The outsiders’ kid, [[Valda]], acts like Jeremy is a helpless little baby. Sure, he’s never caught a [[fish]] or fought a hostile [[mob]], and maybe at school they only let you read about [[crafting]] and never try it yourself. But that doesn’t mean Valda has to be so rude!

But that’s not the only trouble Valda’s family has brought with them. They’re here with a terrifying story: A new kind of [[zombie]] has appeared, one that can do things no zombie should be able to do—working together, stealing resources, and terrorizing the folks who live outside the city’s walls. To stop them, Jeremy and Valda are going to need to put aside their differences, team up, and learn from each other’s cultures—or the Overworld may never be the same!<ref name=MCOutsider/>
