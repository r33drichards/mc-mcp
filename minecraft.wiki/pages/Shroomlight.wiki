'''Shroomlights''' are [[light]]-emitting [[block]]s that generate in [[huge fungus|huge fungi]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Shroomlight blocks can be [[breaking|broken]] with any tool, and always drop as an item, but a [[hoe]] is the fastest.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Shroomlight|hoe|sword=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Both crimson and warped [[huge fungi]] can generate shroomlights near the top. This includes both naturally generated huge fungi and huge fungi grown with [[bone meal]].

== Usage ==
=== Light source ===
Shroomlights provide a light level of 15, the highest level in the game. Unlike glowstone, shroomlights also allow redstone signals to pass through them, as they are treated like a solid block. 

=== Composting ===
Placing a shroomlight into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
