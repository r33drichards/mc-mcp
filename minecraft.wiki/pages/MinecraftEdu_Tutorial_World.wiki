The '''tutorial world''' of [[MinecraftEdu]] is a map available to the teacher, meant to teach the students how to play ''[[Minecraft]]''.

==Areas==
The map walks the player through a few areas, each one focused on other part of the game:
* '''Starting Area''' - Shows how to use game controls.
* '''Obstacle Course''' - Teaches the player about long jumps, ladders and water.
* '''The Brickyard''' - Place to explore, practice, and find the exit.
* '''Dig and Build''' - Shows the player how to mine and place blocks.
* '''Shapes''' - Teaches the player about different blocks and tools.
* '''The Campgrounds''' - A free area, to explore, play and learn about crafting.

There is also the '''Teacher's Lounge''', that shows the teacher some MinecraftEdu features.

From the Teacher's Lounge, the teacher can teleport to '''Super Double Secret Lounge''', a secret beach with a store.

The teacher can also teleport to an empty lighthouse.

==Jack o' Lanterns ==
In the map there are ten hidden [[Jack o'Lantern]]s:
* Inside a house in the starting area.
* In a cave, between the starting area and the obstacle course.

==Trivia==
* In the bottom of the sea, there is a cave where at the end, there is a sign, saying: "What are you doing down here?".
* The biomes in world doesn't match the map, because the map was built on another world and then pasted into the world.{{verify}}
* There are a lot of ways to escape the map and skip parts of it.
* There is a level 1 [[beacon]] in the campgrounds, but it doesn't provide any effects.
