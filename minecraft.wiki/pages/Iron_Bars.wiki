'''Iron bars''' are the [[iron]] variant of [[bars]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Iron bars can be mined using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Iron Bars|Pickaxe|Wood}}

=== Natural generation ===
Iron bars can generate in [[stronghold]]s, [[woodland mansion]]s, [[savanna]] [[village]]s, [[desert]] villages, [[plains]] villages, [[igloo]] basements, [[ruined portal]]s, and [[trail ruins]].

In [[the End]], there are two [[End spike]]s that have iron bars around their [[End crystal]]s.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|A1= Iron Ingot
|B1= Iron Ingot
|C1= Iron Ingot
|A2= Iron Ingot
|B2= Iron Ingot
|C2= Iron Ingot
|Output= Iron Bars,16
|type= Decoration block
}}
Iron bars are not a source of iron. Once crafted, iron bars cannot be [[smelt]]ed into [[iron nugget]]s or ingots.

=== Post-generation ===
Iron bars regenerate on the [[end spike]]s whenever the [[ender dragon]] is respawned.

== Usage ==
{{for|information about the placement mechanics of all bars|Bars#Usage}}

=== Curing ===
Iron bars speed up the curing process of [[zombie villager]]s.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* {{IN|java}}, a 2×2 area made of iron bars can make a square-shaped hole big enough for the [[player]] and most [[mob]]s to fit through, but not [[rain]], [[water]], etc. that can be used as an easy entrance for an underwater house, and even an exit if [[piston]]s are used. [[Glass pane]]s work in the same way.
* If a [[sign]] or a [[painting]] is placed on iron bars, it appears to float in the air.
* Despite apparently being thin enough to do so, iron bars do not let a [[ghast]]'s explosion touch the block beneath them as long as the block is protected from other angles of the explosion affecting it.
* If an iron bar is connected to a block and a [[rail]] is placed on the block, the top texture of the iron bar disappears.
* While curing a [[zombie villager]], iron bars placed nearby speed up the healing process. The same happens with [[bed]]s, and both these things occur in the stereotypical prison cell.
* [[Arrow]]s cannot be shot through iron bars in Bedrock Edition.
* Because iron bars are 1 block high, the player can normally jump over iron bars, unlike fences.
