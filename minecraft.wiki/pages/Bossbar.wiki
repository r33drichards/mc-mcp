A '''bossbar''' is a bar at the top of the screen that can track [[health]] of a [[Mob#Boss mobs|boss mob]] or the total health of [[raid]] mobs.

The bossbar appears naturally in the game through three means: during a [[raid]], after constructing a [[wither]], and upon entering the End if the [[ender dragon]] has not yet been defeated.

==Creation==
===Manual===
{{main|Commands/bossbar}}
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
{{IN|java}}, a bossbar can be created manually using the {{Command|bossbar}} command.

===Natural===
====Boss mobs====
A bossbar appears in the top center of the screen when near a [[wither]] or [[ender dragon]]. For the ender dragon's bossbar to appear, the player must be within a [[Euclidean distance]] of 192 blocks from the [[coordinates]] (0.0, 192, 0.0) in [[the End]] dimension.<sup>[''[[Java Edition|JE]] only'']</sup>, For the wither's bossbar to appear, the player must be loading the [[chunk]] the wither is in and be within 24 chunks and 3.5 blocks of a chunk the wither is in. For the bossbar to update after taking damage, a mob has to have the [[NBT tag|NBT-Tag]] NoAI set to 0b. <ref name="A">{{bug|MC-84243|||WAI}}</ref>

====Raids====
When a player is within a 93 block radius of the center of a [[raid]], a raid bossbar appears, showing the total health of all raid mobs present during the current wave.

==Components==
===Color===
The bossbar has colors depending on which boss mob or event is active:
*the ender dragon has a color of pink,
*the wither has a light purple bossbar {{in|java}}, or a dark purple bossbar {{in|bedrock}},
*the raid bossbar has a color of red.

===Style===
A bossbar has a style attribute. It can be either "progress", "notched_6", "notched_10", "notched_12" or "notched_20". The value "progress" creates a clean bar, while the other ones create a notched bar with 6, 10, 12 or 20 segments.

The ender dragon and wither own a "progress" bossbar. The bossbar shown during a raid uses the "notched_10" style {{in|java}}, and the "progress" style {{in|bedrock}}.

===ID system===
A bossbar has an ID, which can be used to do certain actions with one bossbar. An ID is not shown on the bossbar{{Verify}}.

==Removal==
{{Expand section}}
===Manual===
A bossbar can be disabled by using {{Command|bossbar remove ''<id>''}}.
===Natural===
A bossbar for the [[ender dragon]] or [[wither]] can be removed by killing it. A bossbar for a [[raid]] can be removed by completing the raid, which is to kill all the raiders involved in this raid.
