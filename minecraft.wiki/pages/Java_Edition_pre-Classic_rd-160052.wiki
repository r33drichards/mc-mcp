'''rd-160052''' is a [[pre-Classic]] version made on May 15, 2009, at 22:42 UTC.<ref>{{link|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140911065544/https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/rd-160052/rd-160052.json|title=rd-160052.json|date=May 15, 2009}}</ref><ref group="note">While the name implies that this build is from May 16, it was actually made very late on May 15 (which was May 16 in Sweden time). Additionally, despite the name implying this version was compiled at the 52nd minute of the hour, the last-modified date in the launcher JAR is actually from the 42nd minute.</ref>

This version is available in the [[launcher]]; however, the copy in the launcher was last modified on August 6, 2013, making it technically not original.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Added block particle entities.
** Appear when [[block]]s are broken.
** Falls to the ground before disappearing.
** Exactly 64 particles are generated when a block is broken.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
* The name of the game is changed from "''Minecraft: Order of the Stone''" to simply just "''Minecraft''".

== Bugs ==
'''2 bugs reported'''
* When alt-tabbing, the GUI disappears (Linux).{{cn}}
* Rendering glitches occur every so often over time, due to misaligned vertex arrays. To resolve this issue, restart the game.{{cn}}

== Trivia ==
* The "rd" before the version number stands for [[RubyDung]], a game Notch was working on before ''Minecraft'', whose codebase was later reused for ''Minecraft''.
* The name of this version is incorrect: it was actually compiled at 00:42 Sweden time, not 00:52 as implied by the name.<ref>See inside launcher client JAR.</ref>
* When taking a screenshot with the 'Print Screen' key, it takes a screenshot of the frame that the program first showed on the screen. Each time the player runs or alt-tabs into the program, it updates that image in memory. When the player hits 'print screen', it does not take what is shown on the player's screen, but pulls it from that memory.
