'''Ice deserts''' are a removed snow-covered [[biome]], which existed prior to the [[Adventure Update]]. The biome consisted of large [[sand]] flats, with a snow layer cover.

== Description ==
Ice deserts were similar in appearance to [[tundra]]s, with fairly flat land and small hills. However, instead of [[grass]], the surface was primarily made up of sand. Flowers, trees and passive mobs were non-existent in this biome. Ice deserts were meant to generate surrounded by the tundra as well. It only existed as an unused biome; it was in the code, but never got implemented into the temperature/rainfall table and thus did not actually generate without the use of mods. It would be the coldest biome to spawn, as it generates if the temperature is below 10%.
