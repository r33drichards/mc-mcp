{{about|credit sequence in [[Minecraft]]|other namesakes|Credits}}

The '''credit sequence''' is the lines of text and music that play after the the [[End Poem]]. The credits serve to recognize those that have contributed to the game.

== Accessing ==
After entering the [[the End]] dimension and killing the [[ender dragon]], the [[exit portal]] is activated, allowing the player to enter and view the End Poem, followed by the credits. The player is then teleported to their spawn point if available, or the world spawn if not. The credits only show upon the player's first entry of the exit portal. The player can also trigger the credits to show by entering an End portal built using [[Creative]] mode or [[commands]].

The credits can be successively sped up by holding {{key|Space}}, then additionally {{key|Ctrl}}, then the other {{key|Ctrl}}.{{only|je}} It can be skipped entirely by pressing {{key|Esc}} {{in|je}} or "skip" {{in|be}}.

The credits can also be accessed by clicking on the copyright information on the [[title screen]] {{in|je}} or by pressing the "credits" button in the "profile" section of the Settings screen {{in|be}}. They can also be viewed on the ''Minecraft'' website.<ref>[https://minecraft.net/credits Minecraft credits]</ref>

== Contents ==
The credits last 68 minutes and 38 seconds and appear below the End Poem. During the credits, the track "[[Alpha (song)|Alpha]]" in the [[Minecraft - Volume Beta|official soundtrack]] (<code>alpha.ogg</code>{{only|java}}/<code>credits.ogg</code>{{only|bedrock}}) plays.

=== Technical details ===
{{IN|java}}, the credits are stored in [[client.jar]]; the text of the credits is in <code>assets/minecraft/texts/credits.json</code>, and the text of the quote is in <code>assets/minecraft/texts/postcredits.txt</code>. {{IN|bedrock}}, the text of the credits is in <code>data/credits/credits.json</code> and the text of the quote is in <code>data/credits/quote.txt</code>. They can both be edited with a [[resource pack]]. The credits is shown the first time the player enters the exit portal based on their {{nbt|byte|seenCredits}}{{only|je|short=1}} ({{nbt|bool|hasSeenCredits}}{{only|be|short=1}}) tag being 0 ({{cd|false}}), after which it is changed to 1 ({{cd|true}}) once the player first enters an End portal while in the End.
