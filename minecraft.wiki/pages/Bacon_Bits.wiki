'''Bacon Bits''' is a [[character]] in the novels published by [[Max Brooks]], briefly serving as a minor antagonist in [[Minecraft: The Mountain|''Minecraft: The Mountain'']]. Formerly a [[piglin brute]], Bacon Bits was zombified following an altercation with Guy, and took on a new life as the sole inhabitant of [[The Mountain (location)|the Mountain]].

== Appearance ==
When first introduced, Bacon Bits is not described to look any different from other piglin brute. Upon entering the [[Overworld]], Bacon Bits becomes a zombified piglin, and is also not implied to have any particular distinction. However, it is described as specifically having a rotted face, and emits purple gases while decaying.

== Personality ==
When first encountering [[Guy]], Bacon Bits behaves much like the archetypal piglin brute, being a hostile [[mob]] that attacks on sight. From Guy's perspective, however, Bacon Bits is perceived as a malevolent figure, sneaking up on him. When zombifying, Guy is concerned and reaches out, but gets attacked once again, making him see it as pigheaded. 

Despite this, the animosity does not appear to last long, Guy happily accepting Bacon Bits into his routine. Guy goes on to describe Bacon Bits as harmless, if intrusive, doing nothing but walking around all day and smelling.

== Biography ==
Bacon Bits began life as a piglin brute within a region of the [[Nether]] that manifested overnight. As [[Guy]] and [[Summer]] explored, they happened upon the [[bastion remnant]] Bits originated from. Quickly, they got overwhelmed by swarms of piglins, and attempt to retreat back through a [[ruined portal]] by their base, [[the Ice Cube]]. As Guy rushed to the portal, he got attacked by Bits, narrowly avoiding a hit with his [[shield]]. This  crosses him back into the Overworld, Bacon Bits zombifies, to Guy's shock.

An unknown amount of time later, Bacon Bits has been named and settled down in [[The Mountain (location)|the Mountain]]. This proved beneficial to both of them, Guy enjoying the company. However, at some point he forgot to lock his bedroom door, and thus was greeted with Bacon Bits' face first thing in the morning. After finishing several projects, Guy decides to leave the Mountain behind and explore the wider world. Initially, he opts to leave a newly named Bacon Bits behind in his place, but Summer agrees to come along with him. Bacon Bits would inhabit the Mountain for an unknown span of time, before being discovered by an unidentified [[Minecraft: The Mountain (map)|third person]].
