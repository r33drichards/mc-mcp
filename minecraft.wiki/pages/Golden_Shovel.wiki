A '''golden shovel''' is a variant of [[shovel]] that is crafted from [[gold ingot]]s. It is used to break [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[gravel]] and other related blocks faster, to create [[dirt path]]s from [[Dirt (disambiguation)|dirt-related]] blocks, and to [[Shovel#Campfire|extinguish]] [[campfire]]s. It is the sixth-highest [[tier]] of shovel, having the lowest durability, and having the lowest [[attack damage]] alongside [[wooden shovel]]s, despite having the highest [[mining efficiency]]. It can be [[Piglin#Piglin loved items|admired]] by piglins, and has the highest [[enchantability]].

A golden shovel can be repaired in an [[anvil]] by adding [[gold ingot]]s, with each ingot restoring 25% of the shovel's maximum durability, rounded down. Two golden shovels can also be combined in an anvil. Both methods preserve the shovel's [[enchantment]]s.

=== Enchantments ===
A golden shovel can receive the following [[enchantment]]s:
