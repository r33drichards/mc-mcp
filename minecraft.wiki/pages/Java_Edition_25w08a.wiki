'''25w08a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.5]], released on February 19, 2025, which adds new sound personalities for wolves, overhauls spawn egg textures, and fixes bugs.<ref>{{snap|25w08a|id=a|February 19, 2025}}</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Mobs ===
'''[[Wolf]]'''
* Added six new sound variants.
** The variants are called Classic, Big, Cute, Puglin, Angry, Grumpy, and Sad. The existing wolf sounds are used for the Classic variant.
** Wolves receive a random sound variant when they spawn.
** Sound variants are not related to texture variants.

=== General ===
'''Entity components'''
* <code>wolf/sound_variant</code>
** Namespaced ID from <code>wolf_sound_variant</code> registry.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Leaf litter]]'''
* Leaf litter is now tinted based on which biome it is in.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
[[File:Spawn egg wall.jpg|thumb|A collection of the new spawn egg textures.]]
* Changed the visuals of all spawn eggs to make them easier to distinguish: each type of spawn egg now has its own unique icon instead of all just being colored variants of the same spotted egg.
** Each egg visual varies in shape to reflect the in-world properties of the mob it spawns: for example, smaller mobs tend to have a smaller Spawn Egg icon.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Sheep]]'''
* Reverted the change from [[25w07a]] that allowed blue, light blue, cyan, yellow, orange and red sheep to spawn naturally in different biomes.
** Common sheep color in cold biomes remains black, and uncommon colors are now gray, light gray, white and brown.
** Common sheep color in warm biomes remains brown, and uncommon colors are now gray, light gray, white and black.
** Pink sheep will still be very rare and able to spawn anywhere where sheep can spawn.
* The wool undercoat of sheep is now also colored when dyed, matching existing behavior in {{el|be}}.
* Sheep can now eat [[fern]]s, matching ''Bedrock Edition''.

'''[[Wandering trader]]'''
* Some of the new trades have changed from a stock of one single trade to a stock of two trades.<!-- Elaborate on what this means, does it refer to buy/sell etc. -->
** This applies to the following trades:
***{{ItemLink|Water Bottle}}
***{{ItemLink|Water Bucket}}
***{{ItemLink|Milk Bucket}}
***{{ItemLink|Fermented Spider Eye}}
***{{ItemLink|Baked Potato}}
***{{BlockLink|Hay Bale}}

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Creative]] mode'''
* The tab icon for the Spawn Eggs inventory tab has changed from the [[pig]] spawn egg to the [[creeper]] spawn egg.

=== General ===
'''Biome effects'''
* {{cd|dry_foliage_color}} field
** Defines the color used for tinting blocks using dry foliage tinting.

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* {{cd|blocks_attacks}}
** If the blocked damage has no position, the compared angle will be assumed to be the maximum 180 for {{cd|horizontal_blocking_angle}} field of {{cd|damage_reductions}}.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|68}}.

'''Equipment Assets'''
* Equipment layers configured to be <code>dyeable</code> will now show if the <code>dyed_color</code> component is present on the item, even if the item is not in the <code>#dyeable</code> tag.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|53}}.
* Added the possibility to tint blocks based on a dry foliage color map.
* Added colormap texture for tinting dry foliage tinted blocks.
* Removed {{cd|spawn_egg.png}} and {{cd|spawn_egg_overlay.png}}.
* The texture <code>sheep_fur</code> has been renamed to <code>sheep_wool</code>.

'''[[Tags]]'''
* Added {{cd|fern}} to the {{cd|#edible_for_sheep}} block tag.
* Added {{cd|d=and|cactus|campfire|dry_out|hot_floor|in_fire|lava|lightning_bolt|sweet_berry_bush}} to the {{cd|#bypasses_shield}} damage type tag.
