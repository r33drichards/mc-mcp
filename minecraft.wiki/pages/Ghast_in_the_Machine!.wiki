== Synopsis ==
{{quote|
The adventures continue in the fourth [[Minecraft]] chapter book based on one of the most popular video games of all time. [[Jodi]], [[Ash Kapoor|Ash]], [[Morgan]] and their fellow Minecraft players go out into the real world to find clues to the identity of the mysterious and sinister [[Evoker King]]. Not only do they need to find out who–or what–he is, but they need to know if it’s really possible for him to escape the game! Because if he can, that could spell big trouble both in the game and out!|author=Description<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/602181/ghast-in-the-machine-minecraft-woodsword-chronicles-4-by-nick-eliopulos-illustrated-by-alan-batson/|title=Ghast in the Machine!
