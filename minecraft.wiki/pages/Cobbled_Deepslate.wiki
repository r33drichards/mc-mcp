'''Cobbled deepslate''' is a [[Stone (disambiguation)#Blocks|stone variant]] that functions similar to [[cobblestone]] or [[blackstone]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Cobbled deepslate can be obtained by mining [[deepslate]] using a [[pickaxe]] without [[Silk Touch]] or by mining cobbled deepslate with any pickaxe. When mined using any other tool, it drops nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Cobbled deepslate generates naturally in [[ancient cities]] and [[trial chambers]].

== Usage ==
Cobbled deepslate can be used as a substitute for [[cobblestone]] in crafting stone tools, [[brewing stand]]s, and [[furnace]]s as well as to repair stone tools with an [[anvil]]. It is also used to craft [[polished deepslate]].

Cobbled deepslate cannot be used for making most [[Cobblestone#Crafting ingredient|blocks that use cobblestone in their recipes]], such as [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, and [[piston]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-177904|||WAI}}</ref>

The quickest way to get derivative blocks such as deepslate tile walls from cobbled deepslate is to use a [[stonecutter]]. Using a crafting table requires multiple steps.
