|-
| [[File:Incorrect chunk translucency.png|64px]]
| Distant individual chunks don't order translucent elements correctly according to the player's viewpoint.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-38022}}
|
|-
| [[File:Waterlogged stained glass pane rendering.png|64px]]
| Waterlogged [[stained glass pane]]s occlude some of the faces of the water they're in.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-131203}}<br>{{bug|MC-167319}}
|
|-
| [[File:Honey block inner cube rendering.png|64px]]
| Some blocks such as [[honey block]]s and [[slime block]]s may not fully render inner planes.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-163098}}
| This can be triggered (and fix itself) in response to player movement and rotation.
|-
| [[File:High distance stained glass rendering.png|64px]]
| At high distances (see [[Java Edition distance effects]]), translucent planes become disordered and render wrongly.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-186362}}
| Does not appear to affect Sodium.
|-
| [[File:Block outline occlusion.png|64px]]
| The outline when targeting blocks is occluded by translucent items and experience orbs.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-262088}}
|
|-
| [[File:Item occlusion by other item.png|64px]]
| Translucent items and experience orbs can occlude each other.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-166359}}<br>{{bug|MC-249146}}
| This appears to depend on the order in which the entities spawned: older entities take priority over newer entities and render on top.
|-
| [[File:Three layer ordering.png|64px]]
| Particles, clouds and translucent entities behind one translucent layer and in front of another render behind both.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-186538}}
|
|-
| [[File:Beacon outer beam with outline behind.png|64px]]
| The outer, translucent beam of a [[beacon]] or [[end gateway]] render behind certain things it is in front of.
| style="text-align:center; background-color:red" | No
| {{bug|MC-262087}}
| This issue is much more obvious when using the resource pack provided in the ticket.
