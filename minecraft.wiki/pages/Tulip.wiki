'''Tulips''' are a kind of [[flower]] found in [[plains]] and [[flower forest]]s that come in multiple colored variants: red, orange, white, and pink. They yield dyes of their respective colors, with the exception of white tulips, which yield light gray dye, and all of them are used to craft [[suspicious stew]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A tulip can be broken instantly with any item or by hand, dropping itself.

A tulip also breaks if [[water]] or [[lava]] runs over its location, if a [[piston]] extends or pushes a block into its location, or if a block under the plant is moved or destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Flower gradients}}

[[File:Plains gradient ultra.png|thumb|Tulip/Non-tulip gradient in plains]]

Tulips of any color generate naturally on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s in [[plains]] and [[sunflower plains]], exclusively in rare tulip-only areas. All kinds of tulips also generate in [[flower forest]] biomes as part of the gradient. {{IN|java}}, tulips are also technically capable of growing in [[dripstone caves]] and [[deep dark]] biomes, though it is very unlikely because grass blocks are rare in these biomes.

[[Flower Pot|Potted]] red and white tulips can also be found in [[woodland mansion]]s.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{Main|Flower#Post-generation}}

When [[bone meal]] is applied to a [[grass block]] in a plains, sunflower plains, and flower forest biome (as well as dripstone caves and deep dark biomes {{in|java}}), tulips have a chance of generating on the targeted [[block]] and adjacent grass blocks in a 15×5×15 area {{in|java}}, or a 7×5×7 area {{in|bedrock}}. In flower forests, whether a tulip can generate and the specific color depend on the flower gradient. In plains and sunflower plains (as well as dripstone cave and deep dark {{in|java}}), tulips of any color can generate exclusively in tulip-only areas.

{{IN|Bedrock}}, when [[bone meal]] is applied to a tulip in any biome, more tulips of the same color appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7×7 square.

=== Mob loot ===
{{IN|java}}, [[endermen]] can pick up tulips, like any other one-block-tall flower, and [[drop]] it if killed while holding it.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell a tulip of any color for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources|Red Tulip|Orange Tulip|White Tulip|Pink Tulip}}

== Usage ==
{{Main|Flower#Usage}}

Like other flowers, tulips can be used as decoration and planted on [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]]s, [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]].

Tulips can also be placed inside [[flower pot]]s.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{Crafting usage|Red Tulip, Orange Tulip, White Tulip, Pink Tulip}}

=== Suspicious stew ===
{{Main|Suspicious Stew}}

Suspicious stew that is created using any tulip imparts the {{EffectLink|Weakness}} effect for 7 seconds. It can be crafted using a tulip or produced by feeding a tulip to a brown [[mooshroom]] and then milking it with a [[bowl]].

=== Bees ===
[[Bee]]s engage in a pollinating behavior with tulips, increasing the honey level in [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s by 1.

=== Breeding ===
Tulips can be used to [[breed]], grow, and lead [[bee]]s.

=== Bee nests ===
[[Oak]], [[birch]], and [[cherry]] trees grown from [[sapling]]s that are within 2 blocks of a tulip have a 5% chance to grow with a [[bee nest]] and 2-3 [[bee]]s in it.

=== Composting ===
Placing a tulip into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of tulips yields an average of 5.94 [[bone meal]].

== Trivia ==
* In real life, a tulip is any member of the [[w:Tulip|''Tulipa'']] genus of flowering plants.
* Despite its name, white tulips give [[Light Gray Dye|light gray dye]] when crafted instead of [[White Dye|white dye]].
* There are two sperate textures for all tulips, which are mirrored on the orange and pink tulips to create four unique textures.
* In merchandise there exists yellow, maroon, light blue, and blue tulips that are not seen in-game. They all have the same stem texture, which is unique from existing tulips.
