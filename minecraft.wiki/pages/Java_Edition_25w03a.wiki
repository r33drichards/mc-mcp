<onlyinclude>'''25w03a''' is the second [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.5]] released on January 15, 2025,<ref>{{snap|25w03a|id=a|January 15, 2025}}</ref> which adds [[Test Block|test block]], [[Test Instance Block|test instance block]] and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Test Block start JE1.png;Test Block log JE1.png;Test Block fail JE1.png;Test Block accept JE1.png|32px}} [[Test block]]'''
* A technical block used in game test.
* Can be obtained by {{cmd|setblock}}, {{cmd|fill}}, or {{cmd|give}} commands, or through the [[Operator Items Tab]].
* The test block is a block used for implementing block-based tests. It has four modes:
** {{cd|start}}: Triggers a redstone pulse when the test starts
** {{cd|log}}: Logs a message to the server log file when powered by redstone (prints twice, due to a bug<ref name="youtube-6elLSg0y7X4">{{Citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6elLSg0y7X4|title=Mojang just added some WEIRD new blocks. Here's how they work.|author=Conure [@conure512]|website=YouTube|date=2025-01-15|archive-url=https://preservetube.com/watch?v=6elLSg0y7X4}}</ref><!-- 9:10 - 9:30 -->)
** {{cd|fail}}: Fails the test when powered by redstone
** {{cd|accept}}: Completes the test when powered by redstone
* Block-based tests are required to have at least one start block and one accept block in the structure.

'''[[File:Test Instance Block JE1.png|32px]] [[Test instance block]]'''
* A technical block used in game test.
* Can be obtained by {{cmd|setblock}}, {{cmd|fill}}, or {{cmd|give}} commands, or through the [[Operator Items Tab]].
* To run a test in a world, a test instance block is used. This type of block represents the test as placed in the world and is used to interact with that test, to save the structure, reset or run the test.
* Using the {{cmd|test}} command to run or create a test will also place a test instance block to control that test.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|test}}'''
* A new command used to create and run tests.
** Syntax:
*** {{cmd|test clearall [<radius>]}}
*** {{cmd|test clearthat}}
*** {{cmd|test clearthese}}

*** {{cd|depth}}: 
**** The depth of the test structure.
***** If omitted, the {{cd|width}} is used.
*** {{cd|variable}}: 
**** The variable name to include in the copied code snippet.
*** {{cd|numberOfTimes}}: 
**** The number of times to repeat each test.
***** If omitted, {{cd|1}} is used.
*** {{cd|untilFailed}}: 
**** Boolean (default false) noting that the test should be stopped as soon as one iteration fails.
*** {{cd|rotationSteps}}: 
**** Number of extra 90 degree steps to apply to the test.

* {{cmd|test clear*}}
** These subcommands clear the structures and blocks associated with the selected tests.

** This gives a starting point for creating the structure for the test.
* {{cmd|test locate}}
** Attempts to locate the given test. 
*** Note that only loaded chunks are searched.
* {{cmd|test reset*}}
** These subcommands reset the structures for the selected tests, removing any surrounding barriers and placing the structure in from scatch.
* {{cmd|test pos}}
** Shows the local coordinates to the block pointed at in the test. 
** If the optional variable name is specified, this variable name is used in a code fragment obtained by clicking on the coordinates in the output message.
* {{cmd|test run*}}
** Runs one or more tests. 
*** If multiple tests are run at once, they are placed in a grid and run in parallel, although only up to a certain limit. Beyond that limit, tests are run in rounds where each round completes before any tests from the next round are started.
*** For each test, loads the given structure and runs the associated test. Each test location will have a beacon beam showcasing the test status.
**** Gray beacon = in progress
**** Red = fail (required test)
**** Orange = fail (optional test)

*** Note that gameplay events triggered by tests may still remain.
* {{cmd|test verify*}}
** Verifies one or more tests by running multiple instances of the same test.

*** Possible values: depends on component type.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the {{cd|#can_equip_saddle}} entity tag.
