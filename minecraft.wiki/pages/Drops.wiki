[[File:Skeleton drops.png|thumb|right|Drops from a [[skeleton]]: [[experience orb]]s, [[arrow]]s, a [[bone]], and a [[bow]].]]

'''Drops''' are [[item (entity)|items]] that appear when [[mob]]s and some other [[entities]] die or when most kinds of [[block]]s are broken.

== Types of drops ==
Mobs do not drop any of the following if the [[game rule]] {{cd|doMobLoot}} is set to {{cd|false}}.

=== Common drops ===
'''Common drops''' may appear at the location of a [[mob]] at the moment it receives [[Health#Death|fatal damage]]. Most mobs have certain items that they may drop when killed. Some common drops, such as [[leather]], don't always drop, but have a large chance (at least 50%, depending on the drop range) to do so. Some common drops, such as [[blaze rod]]s, don't drop at all if the mob was not killed by the [[player]].

Each of these items has a drop range, which is a random [[wikipedia:Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]] of numbers of items that drop. For example, a [[cow]] drops 0–2 leather items and 1–3 [[raw beef]] items. Because the range for leather includes 0, there is a {{frac|1|3}} chance of no leather being dropped.

A [[baby animal]] does not drop any common drops upon death. 

==== Looting ====
Some common and uncommon drops are affected by the [[Looting]] enchantment. At most, a number of additional items equal to enchantment level are dropped.

More specifically, the game generates a fractional number ranging from 0 to the Looting level, which is then rounded to the nearest integer. This causes the numbers in the middle of drop range to occur twice as often. The probabilities are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Looting extra items
|-
! Looting level
! No items
! 1 item
! 2 items
! 3 items
|-
| Looting I
| {{frac|1|2}}
| {{frac|1|2}}
| --
| --
|-
| Looting II
| {{frac|1|4}}
| {{frac|1|2}}
| {{frac|1|4}}
| --
|-
| Looting III
| {{frac|1|6}}
| {{frac|1|3}}
| {{frac|1|3}}
| {{frac|1|6}}
|}

A [[stray]]'s tipped [[arrow]] is a special case: while Looting can attempt to increase arrow drop amount, the final number of dropped arrows is capped at 1. So, Looting effectively increases arrow dropping odds, up to {{frac|11|12}} with Looting III.
<!-- only common and rare drop shown at table 
=== Uncommon drops ===
''Uncommon drops'' normally consist of a single item that has less than 50% chance of dropping. Technically, they're just common drops that have a negative drop range minimum. For example, a spider's eye has a drop range of -1–1, so there's a {{frac|1|3}} chance of dropping one eye and {{frac|2|3}} chance to drop either zero or "negative one", i.e. nothing. They otherwise behave just like common drops.

The Looting enchantment technically works just like it does for common drops, however, if "negative" number of items would drop before Looting bonus, it is subtracted from the bonus instead of being added to it, potentially bringing it down to zero.
-->
=== Rare drops ===
''Rare drops'' normally appear if the monster is killed by a player (see {{Slink|Player kills}} below), although some rare drops can also be obtained by other means. Rare drops are always a single item, but may appear in conjunction with other common drops. A drop is considered rare if they are accompanied by the <code>random_chance_with_looting</code> condition in the mob's [[loot table]].

Rare drops typically have a 2.5% chance of dropping, plus 1 percentage point per level of [[Looting]] on the weapon used (up to a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III). An exception to this is that a [[rabbit]] drops a [[rabbit's foot]] with a 10% chance, plus 3 percentage points per level of Looting (to a maximum of 19% with Looting III). {{In|Bedrock}} there are other exceptions: a [[wither skeleton]] drops a [[wither skeleton skull]] with a 2.5% chance plus 2 percentage points per level of Looting (to a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III), and a [[drowned]] drops a [[copper ingot]] with an 11% chance plus 2 percentage points per level of looting (to a maximum of 17% with Looting III).

Note that in case of multiple rare drops ([[guardian]] and [[zombie]] types) the 2.5% chance is split between them, instead of being rolled for each item.

The [[shulker shell]] is technically also a rare drop, only ever dropping in singles from [[shulker]]s, although they don't require a player kill, have a 50% base chance, and increase by 6.25% per Looting level.{{only|java|short=1}}

=== Equipped items ===
[[File:Power Bow Rare Drop.png|thumb|250px|An enchanted bow received from a skeleton's drops.]]

When killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]], a mob can drop equipment and armor that it spawned with. Each piece of equipment the mob was spawned with is dropped with an 8.5% chance {{in|java}} or 25% chance {{in|bedrock}}. [[Potion]]s and [[milk bucket]]s temporarily held by [[witch]]es or [[wandering trader]]s also have a 8.5% chance of dropping if the mob is killed while holding one; a [[vex]]'s [[iron sword]], and [[carved pumpkin]]s and [[jack o'lantern]]s worn during Halloween in ''Java Edition'' have a 0% chance instead. This value is determined by the mob's [[Chunk format/Mob|<code>drop_chances</code> tag]].

The [[Looting]] enchantment increases this chance by 1% per level (up to 11.5% in ''Java Edition'' or 28% in ''Bedrock Edition'' with Looting III). The chance is rolled for each piece of equipment, so it is possible for a mob to drop more than one piece of equipment upon death.

If the item has durability, its damage is defined by the formula: <code>MaxDamage - randomInt(1+ randomInt(Max(MaxDamage-3,1)))</code> where MaxDamage is the item's maximum damage and randomInt(x) is is an integer between 0 and x-1. Thus the damage varies between 4 and the maximum damage, being more likely to have greater damage.

There are also some equipped items that are guaranteed to drop. In all of these cases, the items are dropped even if the mob is not killed by a player or a tamed wolf.

* All items a mob picks up after spawning are always dropped, even when it isn't killed by a player and even if it is a baby [[zombie]].
** This is not the case for [[villager]]s.
* The item a [[fox]] spawns with is always dropped.
* A [[drowned]] spawned with a [[nautilus shell]] in the off-hand always drops it.
* An ominous banner is always dropped by [[illager]]s wearing it.
* [[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[llama]]s, [[camel]]s, [[happy ghast]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[strider]]s drop any [[item]]s equipped to them by players, like [[saddle]]s, [[carpet]]s or [[chest]]s.

=== Experience orbs ===
{{Main|Experience}}

''Experience orbs'' drop only if a [[mob]] dies less than three seconds after being attacked (melee, bow, snowballs, eggs, and potions causing instant damage) by a player or by a player's pet [[wolf]], though not by a player-activated [[dispenser]]. Their total value is the specific amount of experience granted by killing that mob. They are also dropped from a thrown [[bottle o' enchanting]]. Collected experience accumulates into levels which can be used for [[enchanting]] or [[repairing]], or is split equally between accumulating levels and repairing the held tool if said tool is enchanted with [[mending]].

Unlike other drops, such as [[item (entity)|items]], experience orbs appear at the location of the mob's corpse at the moment it disappears in a puff of smoke.{{only|be|short=1}} Experience orbs move toward any nearby players.

=== Monsters ===
Weapons, tools, and armor dropped by mobs have at least 25 durability remaining, which is also the most common. Less-damaged items are increasingly rare.

Except for gold swords and tools, items always have at least 26 points of damage taken. Gold items can be dropped un-damaged.

== Block drops ==
Most blocks drop themselves when broken - sometimes [[Silk Touch]] enchantment or a specific [[tool]] is required. All other cases, when blocks drop something different (or don't drop anything), are listed below. Unbreakable blocks, like [[bedrock]], are not listed. "Obtainable with Silk Touch" column indicates if the block can be collected using the Silk Touch enchantment. See [[Silk Touch#Obtainable blocks]] for more information. [[Fortune]] enchantment can affect number of block drops and probabilities (but not the type) as well, see [[Fortune#Usage]] for more information.

* Blocks marked with "T" need to be broken with a specific tool to drop anything (including [[experience]]). The [[Silk Touch]] enchantment doesn't remove this requirement.
* Where noted, [[Fortune]] can increase the number of dropped items or multiply it. Increase simply gives 0-lvl extra items. Multiplication happen with the following chances:
** Fortune I: 33% * 2 (33% more on average)
** Fortune II: 25% * 2, 25% * 3 (75% more on average)
** Fortune III: 20% * 2, 20% * 3, 20% * 4 (120% more on average)
* Container blocks ([[barrel]]s, [[blast furnace]]s, [[brewing stand]]s, [[campfire]]s, [[chest]]s, [[chiseled bookshelves]], [[decorated pot]]s, [[dispenser]]s, [[dropper]]s, [[flower pot]]s, [[furnace]]s, [[glow item frame]]s{{only|BE|short=1}}, [[hopper]]s, [[item frame]]s{{only|BE|short=1}}, [[jukebox]]es, [[lectern]]s, [[smoker]]s, [[soul campfire]]s, and [[trapped chest]]s) drop themselves when broken along with their content.
