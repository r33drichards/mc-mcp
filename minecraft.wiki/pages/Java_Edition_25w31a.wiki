'''25w31a''' is the first [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.9]], released on July 29, 2025.<ref>{{snap|25w31a|id=a|July 29, 2025}}</ref>  It adds new features such as [[copper armor]] and [[tool]]s, [[copper nugget]]s, [[copper horse armor]], [[copper chest]]s, [[copper golem]]s, and [[shelves]].

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{animate|Copper Chest.png; Exposed Copper Chest.png; Weathered Copper Chest.png; Oxidized Copper Chest.png|32px}} [[Copper chest]]'''
* A new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants.
* Copper chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other copper blocks.
* Copper chests can be crafted using a [[chest]] and [[copper ingot]]s.

'''{{animate|Copper Golem Statue.png; Exposed Copper Golem Statue.png; Weathered Copper Golem Statue.png; Oxidized Copper Golem Statue.png|32px}} [[Copper golem statue]]'''
* A decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants.
* Copper golem statue oxidizes over time and can be waxed like [[copper block]]s.
* The pose of the block can be changed by interacting with it.
* If the copper golem statue has no oxidation when interacted with using an [[axe]], the block will turn into a copper golem again.
* When connected to a [[redstone comparator]], the copper golem statue block emits a redstone signal based on its current pose.

'''{{animate|Exposed Lightning Rod (U) JE1.png; Weathered Lightning Rod (U) JE1.png; Oxidized Lightning Rod (U) JE1.png|32px}} [[Lightning rod]]'''
* Added exposed, weathered, and oxidized variants and their respective waxed variants.

'''{{animate|Spruce Shelf.png; Oak Shelf.png; Birch Shelf.png; Dark Oak Shelf.png; Pale Oak Shelf.png; Mangrove Shelf.png; Cherry Shelf.png; Crimson Shelf.png; Warped Shelf.png; Bamboo Shelf.png|32px}} [[Shelf]]'''
* A decorative block which comes in all wood variants.
* Can be crafted from six matching blocks of any [[stripped log]], [[stripped stem]], or [[block of stripped bamboo]], filling the top and bottom row, producing 6 shelves.
{{Crafting
|A1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|B1 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem

|C3 = Matching Stripped Log; Block of Stripped Bamboo; Matching Stripped Stem
|Output = Matching Shelf, 6
|type = Decoration block
|ignoreusage=1
}}
* The shelf can store up to 3 item stacks:
** Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot.
** The shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an item frame.
* While a shelf is powered by redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered shelves will connect.
** Interacting with a single powered shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar.
** Interacting with two connected shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar.
** Interacting with three connected shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar.
** It does not matter which of the connected shelves the player interacts with.
* They provide a signal value to [[redstone comparator]]s placed at the back: the strength of the signal is a binary number based on the filling state of the slot, with the left slot being the least significant bit and the right slot being the most significant bit.

=== Items ===
'''{{animate|Copper Helmet (item).png;Copper Chestplate (item).png;Copper Leggings (item).png;Copper Boots (item).png|32px}} [[Copper armor]]'''
* Added [[copper helmet]]s, [[copper chestplate]]s, [[copper leggings]], and [[copper boots]].
** Copper armor has higher durability than leather and gold, but less than iron. Copper armor enchantability sits slightly lower than with iron.

'''[[File:Copper_Horse_Armor_(item)_JE1.png|32px]] [[Copper horse armor]]'''
* A new variant of [[horse armor]].
* Has the same loot table and chance of generating as [[iron horse armor]].
* Has an armor value of {{armor|4}}.
* Cannot be crafted.

'''[[File:Copper Nugget.png|32px]] [[Copper nugget]]'''
* Added copper nuggets.
** Copper equipment turns into copper nuggets when smelted.
* Copper nuggets can be crafted by using a copper ingot.
{{crafting

|Output = Copper Nugget,9
|ignoreusage=1
}}

'''{{animate|Copper Sword.png;Copper Axe.png;Copper Pickaxe.png;Copper Shovel.png;Copper Hoe.png|32px}} [[Copper tools]]'''
* Added [[copper axe]]s, [[copper hoe]]s, [[copper pickaxe]]s, [[copper shovel]]s, and [[copper sword]]s.
** Mine faster and are more durable than stone tools, but not iron tools.
** More enchantable than diamond tools, but slightly less than iron tools.
** Possess identical damage and attack speed to stone tools.
** Cannot mine any more blocks than stone tools can.

[[File:Copper Golem Spawn Egg BE1.png|32px]] '''[[Copper golem spawn egg]]'''
*Added copper golem spawn egg.

=== Mobs ===
'''{{Animate|Copper Golem BE1.png;Exposed Copper Golem BE1.png;Weathered Copper Golem BE1.png;Oxidized Copper Golem BE1.png|32px}} [[Copper golem]]'''
* A new mob which can be spawned by placing a [[jack o'lantern]] or [[carved pumpkin]] on top of a [[copper block]].
* Has {{hp|12}} health points.
* Drops 1 to 3 [[copper ingot]]s when killed.
* They are immune to fall damage, and do not drown underwater.
* Copper golems oxidize over time and can be waxed like copper blocks.
* Copper golems take on the oxidization state of the [[copper block]] used to make them.
* If the copper golem has fully oxidized and is not waxed, it will turn into a [[copper golem statue]] block.
** When turned into a copper golem statue, the copper golem will drop any item it may be holding.
** A copper golem turned into a copper golem statue will keep its name if named with a [[name tag]].
* Copper golems can help with sorting items into [[chest]]s.
* If it is not holding an item, it will look for a nearby [[copper chest]] and pick up items from that chest.
** The copper golem will look in any oxidized and waxed copper chest variant to pick up items.
** It can pick up at most 16 items in a stack at a time.
** Any item in a copper chest can be picked up.
* Interacting with the copper golem with an empty hand will make it drop its carried item.
* If it is holding an item, it will look for nearby wooden [[chest]]s to try to place the item into.
** The copper golem will look in chests and trapped chests to try to place items.
** It can only place an item in a chest if the chest is empty or contains the same type, name and enchantments of item the golem is holding in its hand.
* It will visit a max of 10 copper chests when looking for items to pick up, and a max of 10 chests when looking for somewhere to put the items.
* If no matching chest is found, the copper golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again.
* The search area for chests from the copper golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks.

=== General ===
'''[[Options]]'''
* Added "Invert Mouse X" option to the Mouse Settings screen, which inverts the mouse x-axis.
* Added "Sprint Window" option to the Controls screen, which represents the time window in ticks where double-tapping the forward key activates sprint.

* Dye colors now have updated icons.
** The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility.

'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''

** The mob no longer spawns for one tick when an attempt is made to use the spawn egg.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Happy ghast]]'''

* Riding sound volume is slightly increased.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|summon}}'''
* Now fails when trying to summon monsters while the difficulty is set to Peaceful.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Sound]]s'''
* Sounds for chests now play at a lower volume.
* The volume at which a sound is played at now respects the sound source volume value.
* The "Voice/Speech" sound source has been renamed to "Narrator/Voice".
* Added new sound events: {{cd|block.copper_chest.open}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest.close}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_weathered.open}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_weathered.close}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_oxidized.open}}, {{cd|block.copper_chest_oxidized.close}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.step}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.hurt}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.death}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.spin}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.step}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.hurt}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.death}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_weathered.spin}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.step}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.hurt}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.death}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_oxidized.spin}}, {{cd|item.armor.equip_copper}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.spawn}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.no_item_get}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.no_item_not_get}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.item_drop}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem.item_no_drop}}, {{cd|entity.copper_golem_become_statue}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.break}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.place}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.hit}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.fall}}, {{cd|block.copper_golem_statue.step}}, {{cd|block.shelf.activate}}, {{cd|block.shelf.deactivate}}, {{cd|block.shelf.multi_swap}}, {{cd|block.shelf.place_item}}, {{cd|block.shelf.single_swap}}

=== General ===
'''[[Chunks]]'''
* The concept of fixed "spawn chunks" has been removed.
* A dimension that has any player activity, forceloaded chunks, active portals, or ender pearls in flight will be considered "active" and will keep processing chunks and entities.
** Previously, this would only apply if a player was in the dimension or a chunk was forceloaded.
* The game will ensure that the following chunks are fully loaded before the player joins or the server starts, in the same way as spawn chunks formerly were:
** Chunks loaded by the {{cmd|forceload}} command.
** Chunks active due to portal activity.
** Thrown ender pearls (Singleplayer only).
** The small area of chunks around the player (Singleplayer only).
** Chunks required to assign the global world spawn (World creation only).

'''[[Data component format]]'''
* {{cd|blocks_attacks}} item component.
** If the damage reduced in an attack is {{cd|0}}, for example by angle threshold not matching, the item can no longer get disabled in the attack, nor cause knockback due to blocking.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now {{cd|82.0}}.

'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* Was reworked to be less cluttered and more configurable.
* It can now be accessed from everywhere in the game, not only when in a game world.
** It now displays less information by default.
* Added a new Debug Options screen which can be opened by pressing {{Key|F3 + F5}}.
** It can be used to configure which debug information should be displayed.
** For each item the player can choose if it should be turned off, visible when the debug screen (F3) is open, or it should always be visible, even when the debug screen is closed.
** Some debug features that were previously available, like chunk border rendering or entity hitbox rendering, can now be toggled through this debug options screen.
** Some debug features that were not previously available to the community, like Octree visualization, are now accessible through the debug options screen.
** The state of the debug options screen is saved between the launches of the game.
** The debug options screen has the following preset profiles:
*** {{cd|Default}} resets everything to the default state.
*** {{cd|Performance}} shows simple performance metrics, including the FPS meter always visible on screen.

'''[[Density function]]'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:find_top_surface}}
** Approximates the topmost surface of a given density function.
** It scans from an upper bound to a lower bound to find the point at which the density changes from negative to positive.
*** The upper bound should be as close to the actual surface for best performance.
*** The upper bound should never be lower than the actual surface.
** Fields:
*** {{cd|density}} - density function to approximate the surface of.
*** {{cd|upper_bound}} - 2D density function providing the highest possible y-value.
*** {{cd|lower_bound}} - integer, lowest possible y-value.
*** {{cd|cell_height}} - positive integer defining the grid resolution on which to scan.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:invert}}
** Resolves to {{cd|1/argument}}
** Fields:
*** {{cd|argument}} - density function.

'''[[Game rule]]'''
* The game rule {{cd|spawnChunkRadius}} was removed.

'''[[Jigsaw structure]]s'''
* The {{cd|max_distance_from_center}} field may now specify a different restriction on the vertical axis from horizontal.
** This can be specified by an object with fields:
*** {{cd|horizontal}} - required integer between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|128}}.
*** {{cd|vertical}} - optional integer between {{cd|1}} and {{cd|4096}} (default: {{cd|4096}}).
**** e.g: <code>"max_distance_from_center": { "horizontal": 20, "vertical": 500 }</code>.
** The previous format of a single inline value specifying both horizontal and vertical distance is still supported.

'''[[Loading world screen]]'''
* The world loading screen now shows the chunks that the player is about to be placed into, rather than chunks loaded around world spawn.
* The loading screen additionally now includes a progress bar.
** This progress bar accounts for all kinds of chunk loading as mentioned above.
** It was in versions before [[Java Edition 1.3.1|1.3.1]] with a slightly different texture.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added {{cd|minecraft:entity_interact}} loot table type which takes the following parameters:
** {{cd|target_entity}}, the entity being interacted with.
** {{cd|interacting_entity}}, the optional entity that is interacting with the {{cd|target_entity}}.
** {{cd|tool}}, the tool used to interact with {{cd|target_entity}}.
* Added {{cd|minecraft:block_interact}} loot table type which takes the following parameters:
** {{cd|block_state}}, the block state of the block entity being interacted with.
** {{cd|block_entity}}, the optional block entity being interacted with.
** {{cd|interacting_entity}}, the optional entity that is interacting with the {{cd|block_state}}.
** {{cd|tool}}, the optional tool used to interact with {{cd|block_state}}.
* Fields that specify a target entity in a loot table, such as {{cd|entity_properties.entity}}, can additionally target the {{cd|target_entity}} and {{cd|interacting_entity}} parameter types.
* Added {{cd|charged_creeper/root}} loot table for drops when an entity is killed by a [[charged creeper]].
** This loot table dispatches on the mob that was killed, to the following loot tables:
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/piglin}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/creeper}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/skeleton}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/wither_skeleton}}
*** {{cd|charged_creeper/zombie}}
** Once any mob killed drops an item from this loot table, other mobs killed by the same [[creeper]] will not drop from this loot table.
* Added {{cd|brush/armadillo}} loot table for drops when an [[armadillo]] is brushed.
* Added {{cd|gameplay/turtle_grow}} loot table for drops when a [[turtle]] grows into an adult.
* Added {{cd|harvest/beehive}} loot table for drops when a [[beehive]] or [[bee nest]] is harvested using [[shears]].
* Added {{cd|harvest/cave_vine}} loot table for drops when a [[cave vine]] with [[glowberries]] is harvested by interacting with it.
* Added {{cd|carve/pumpkin}} loot table for drops when a [[pumpkin]] is carved using [[shears]].

'''[[Options]]'''
* A button leading to the Controls screen has been added to the Accessibility Settings screen.
** The "Auto-Jump" option, as well as the "Sneak" and "Sprint" toggles have been removed from the Accessibility Settings screen.
* The "Show Subtitles" option has been renamed to "Closed Captions".
* The "Attack/Destroy" and "Use Item/Place Block" keybinds are now toggleable, meaning they can be set to either "Hold" or "Toggle" in the Controls screen.

'''[[Pack format]]'''
* The pack versions for data packs and resource packs now have minor versions.
** A minor version increment of the game's pack version is backwards-compatible, meaning all packs made for previous iterations of the same major version will keep working.
* Packs can set compatibility requirements on minor versions in case they rely on resources introduced in a minor version.

'''[[Pack.mcmeta]]'''
* The {{cd|pack.mcmeta}} format has been updated:
** The {{cd|supported_formats}} field has been removed.
*** If the pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < {{cd|82}}, resource pack < {{cd|65}}), it is still required.
*** Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed.
** The {{cd|pack_format}} field is now optional.
*** If the pack declares support for a pack version with the previous format (data pack < {{cd|82}}, resource pack < {{cd|65}}), it is still required.
** Added required field {{cd|min_format}} - specifies the minimum version supported.
*** A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g {{cd|[74, 1]}}
*** Specifying a single integer is interpreted as that major version, e.g. {{cd|74}} is the same thing as {{cd|[74, 0]}}.
*** Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone.
** Added required field {{cd|max_format}} - specified the maximum version supported.
*** A full version is specified as a list of two integers, e.g {{cd|[74, 1]}}
*** Specifying a single integer is interpreted as any minor version, i.e. the minor version is {{cd|0x7fffffff}}.
*** Specifying a list of a single integer is interpreted the same as specifying that integer alone.
** For overlay entries:
*** The {{cd|formats}} field has been removed.
**** If the pack includes any overlay range that includes a pack version with the previous format (data pack < 82, resource pack < 65), it is still required for all overlay definitions.
**** Otherwise, it is not allowed and must be removed.
*** Added required field {{cd|min_format}} and {{cd|max_format}} with the same formats the fields above with the same name for the {{cd|pack}} section.

'''[[Rendering]]'''
* Entity rendering order was improved for significantly better performance.
** Areas with lots of mobs, like mob farms, will have a smoother gameplay.
** FPS will not improve much if most of the lag comes from things other than entities, like playing with high render distance while not being near many mobs.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The version is now {{cd|65.0}}.
* Added new block sprites: {{cd|copper}}, {{cd|copper_left}}, {{cd|copper_right}}, {{cd|exposed_copper}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_left}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_right}}, {{cd|weathered_copper}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_left}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_right}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_left}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_right}}, {{cd|acacia_shelf}}, {{cd|bamboo_shelf}}, {{cd|birch_shelf}}, {{cd|cherry_shelf}}, {{cd|crimson_shelf}}, {{cd|dark_oak_shelf}}, {{cd|jungle_shelf}}, {{cd|mangrove_shelf}}, {{cd|oak_shelf}}, {{cd|pale_oak_shelf}}, {{cd|spruce_shelf}}, {{cd|warped_shelf}}
* Added new entity sprites: {{cd|copper_golem}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_golem}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_golem}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_golem}}, {{cd|copper_golem_eyes}}, {{cd|exposed_copper_golem_eyes}}, {{cd|weathered_copper_golem_eyes}}, {{cd|oxidized_copper_golem_eyes}}
* Added new item sprites: {{cd|copper_axe}}, {{cd|copper_boots}}, {{cd|copper_chestplate}}, {{cd|copper_golem_spawn_egg}}, {{cd|copper_helmet}}, {{cd|copper_hoe}}, {{cd|copper_leggings}}, {{cd|copper_nugget}}, {{cd|copper_pickaxe}}, {{cd|copper_shovel}}, {{cd|copper_sword}}

'''[[Shader]]s''' & '''Post-process effects'''
* Full Screen Passes
** The following vertex shaders have been removed, and replaced by {{samp|core/screenquad.vsh}}:
*** {{samp|core/blit_screen.vsh}}
*** {{samp|post/blit.vsh}}
*** {{samp|post/blur.vsh}}
*** {{samp|post/invert.vsh}}
*** {{samp|post/sobel.vsh}}
*** {{samp|post/screenquad.vsh}}
** Vertex shaders for post-processing effects, as well as lightmap generation and full screen blits are no longer are passed the {{cd|Position}} attribute, and instead must assign vertex coordinates by {{cd|gl_VertexID}}.
** These passes furthermore are only executed with 3 vertices, instead of a full quad

'''[[Tags]]'''
* Biome Tags
** Added {{cd|cherry_grove}} to {{cd|#stronghold_biased_to}} tag.
* Block Tags
** Added {{cd|#copper_chests}} to {{cd|#guarded_by_piglins}} tag.

'''[[World Generation]]'''
* The {{cd|initial_density_without_jaggedness}} field in {{cd|noise_settings}} definitions has been replaced with a {{cd|preliminary_surface_level}} field.
** {{cd|initial_density_without_jaggedness}} was a 3D density function that was used to determine an approximate surface level by scanning for the first point with a density greater than {{cd|0.390625}}.
** {{cd|preliminary_surface_level}} is a 2D density function that should produce the y-level of the approximate surface.
** The {{cd|minecraft:find_top_surface}} density function can be used to replicate the previous scanning.
