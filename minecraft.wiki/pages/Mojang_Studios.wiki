== History ==
[[Markus Persson]] and Rolf Jansson started development on the massively multiplayer online role-playing game ''[[Wurm Online]]'' in 2003,<ref>{{link|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/76896/wurm-online-hitting-version-10-after-almost-a-decade|title=Wurm Online hitting version 1.0 after almost a decade|website=ShackNews|author=Alice O'Connor|date=December 4, 2012}}</ref> using the name Mojang Specifications.<ref>{{link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/2003/http://www.wurmonline.com/|title=Wurm Online}}</ref> Persson and Jansson incorporated their business under the name Mojang Specifications AB in 2007. Persson soon left and wished to reuse the name "Mojang"; Jansson renamed his company to Onetoofree AB, and later to {{w|Code Club AB}}.

During early development on ''Minecraft'', Persson reused the name Mojang Specifications. After declining a job offer at {{w|Valve Corporation|Valve}}, Persson incorporated Mojang Specifications as Mojang AB ("Mojäng Aktiebolag", Swedish for "Gadget Ltd.") with [[Jakob Porsér]].<ref>{{link|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/the-history-of-minecraft|website=TechRadar|title=The history of Minecraft|author=Alex Cox|date=June 13, 2018}}</ref> Persson then hired [[Carl Manneh]] as CEO, since both wanted to focus on ''Minecraft''{{hairsp}}'s development.

Mojang publicly announced on September 15, 2014 that they would be bought by {{w|Microsoft}} for US$2.5 billion,<ref>{{link|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140915131835/https://mojang.com/2014/09/yes-were-being-bought-by-microsoft/|website=mojang.com|title=Yes, we’re being bought by Microsoft|author=[[Owen Jones]]|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{link|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2014/09/15/minecraft-to-join-microsoft/|website=Microsoft News|title=Minecraft to join Microsoft|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{link|url=https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2014/09/15/games-minecraft-to-join-microsoft/|website=Xbox News|title=Minecraft to Join Microsoft|author=Phil Spencer|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|lXNWchwDiG8|Minecraft to Join Microsoft|Xbox|September 15, 2014}}</ref> and they subsequently became a subsidiary of Microsoft Studios (now known as Xbox Game Studios) on November 6, 2014.<ref>{{tweet|XboxP3|530368089418784768|It's official, today we welcome Mojang to the Microsoft Studios family.

{{hatnote|Main Wiki: [https://callersbane.fandom.com/wiki/Caller%27s_Bane_Wiki Caller's Bane Wiki]}}

''Caller's Bane'' (originally known as ''Scrolls'') is a Mojang-developed game first conceived and developed by [[Jakob Porsér]],<ref>[https://scrolls.com/ Caller's Bane]</ref> with [[Måns Olson]] and [[Henrik Pettersson]] joining later on.<ref>{{tumblr|ScrollsDev|75801791192|Team changes|February 6, 2014}}</ref> Announced on March 2, 2011,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314015932/https://www.mojang.com/2011/03/introducing-our-new-game-scrolls/|title=Introducing our New Game: Scrolls|website=Mojang.com|author=Jakob Porsér|date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> it aims to combine elements from trading card games and traditional board games in the strategy genre.

In August 2011, Mojang had been threatened with legal action by the legal team representing {{w|ZeniMax Media}} with the accusation being that the original title "''Scrolls''" infringes on the ''{{w|The Elder Scrolls}}'' trademark, a series of role-playing video games published by {{w|Bethesda Softworks}} (a ZeniMax Media subsidiary). In mid-October 2011, the court case was won by Mojang,<ref>{{tweet|notch|126196998826242048|We won the interim injunction! We can keep using the name "Scrolls".|October 18, 2011}}</ref> and one employee described the outcome as "the court saw it from our side". No further action was taken against Mojang, and the name "''Scrolls''" was allowed to remain.

The game was first made available to a limited number of people through alpha key giveaways, starting from July 5, 2012.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707221618/https://scrolls.com/2012/07/ready-set-alpha/|title=Ready, Set, Alpha!|website=Caller's Bane|author=Jakob Porsér|date=July 5, 2012}}</ref> It then hit beta on June 3, 2013,<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905101848/https://scrolls.com/2013/06/weve-hit-open-beta-scrolls-is-now-on-sale/|title=We've hit open beta!

The game puts the player in control of a nation warring against others on a tile-based map. Each turn, the player earns income based on how many conquered tiles they have, and can spend earned money to conquer other tiles or improve their own through the construction of structures like forts, villages, and universities, which all provide different bonuses. The player wins a map once they have vanquished all enemies, regardless of actual remaining neutral tiles.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/04/22/crown-council-free-strategy-game-from-minecraft-devs-mojang/|title=Minecraft Devs Release Crown And Council Free|website=Rock Paper Shotgun|author=Alice O'Connor|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mojang-strategy-game-crown-and-council/|title=Mojang releases a free strategy game called Crown and Council|website=PC Gamer|author=Andy Chalk|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> There are 75 maps, with additional maps being procedurally generated.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-dev-releases-surprise-free-game-on-steam/1100-6439094/|title=Minecraft Dev Releases Surprise Free Game on Steam|website=GameSpot|author=Chris Pereira|date=April 22, 2016}}</ref>

{{hatnote|Main Wiki: [https://catacombsnatch.fandom.com/wiki/Catacomb_snatch_Wiki Catacomb Snatch Wiki]}}

''Catacomb Snatch'' is a game developed by Mojang as part of the first annual [[Mojam]] charity event, which took place on February 17, 2012, and lasted for 60 hours.<ref>https://catacombsnatch.net/index.html</ref> During this time, Mojang Studios created a brand-new game from scratch, called Catacomb Snatch. Using the results of a poll in which both the most and least voted for categories were mixed, the game features an "RTS-shoot 'em up" genre and "steampunk-Ancient Egypt" theme. The Humble Indie Bundle website featured live-stream footage of the development, and took donations; those who donated received access to the game not only once it was completed, but when the developers released stable builds during the event.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120222201020/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/40321/Mojang_Humble_Indie_Bundle_team_up_to_make_charity_game.php</ref>

The objective of the game is to collect 50 batches of treasure from a Treasure Trove located somewhere on the randomly generated map before your opponent. Players can gather money by destroying enemies such as bats, cobras, mummies, and pharaohs, and collecting the coins that they drop. These coins can then be used to buy automatic turrets, coin harvesters, bombs, and rails and railcarts from your Base Camp, to help you defend and expand your territory, earn money, destroy obstacles, and build railways.<ref>https://catacombsnatch.net/about.html</ref> The game can be played both against an AI opponent in singleplayer or against another player in multiplayer.

Catacomb Snatch features a soundtrack created by [[C418]] in collaboration with artist Anosou, or Mattias Häggström Gerdt,<ref>https://c418.org/albums/catacomb-snatch/</ref> who also created the music for ''Cobalt''. The game can be downloaded and played for free [https://catacombsnatch.net/index.html here].

{{main|RubyDung}}<!-- Please add a brief description to RubyDung -->
''RubyDung'', short for "Rubylands Dungeon Game",<ref>{{tweet|notch|1019752622947950592|Dunno if I told anyone this, but that version was called "rubydung", as a placeholder name for a dungeon game in the rubylands rough gameworld i had in my head.|July 18, 2018}}</ref> was a ''Dwarf Fortress''-inspired game being developed by Notch in early 2009. The game would have focused on being easier to play and more accessible than its predecessor, and would have featured both isometric and first-person viewing modes. Upon discovering ''[[Infiniminer]]'', Notch decided a first-person block-based game would be a better choice for the kind of gameplay he had in mind,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20210513102920/https://notch.tumblr.com/post/227922045/the-origins-of-minecraft#_=_</ref> and code and art from ''RubyDung'' were reused to create ''Minecraft''.

===== ''Zombie Town'' =====
{{main|Zombie Town}}
''Zombie Town'' was a ''GTA: Chinatown Wars''-inspired game being developed by Notch in early 2009. It would have been a zombie game based on one of Notch’s earlier projects, ''Left 4k Dead''. The game was never completed, but Notch later reused its character models and textures for the player character in ''Minecraft''.
