A '''hardened stained glass pane''' is the dyed variant of [[hardened glass pane]] obtained by crafting with [[stained glass pane]]s and several [[compound]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Unlike a normal stained glass pane, a hardened stained glass pane drops as an [[item]] to be picked up again when broken with any tool or by hand. It also takes significantly longer to break.
