'''17w46a''' is the fifth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.13]], released on November 15, 2017<ref>{{snap|17w46a|November 15, 2017}}</ref>, which added the {{cmd|datapack}} command.

== Additions ==
=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|datapack}}'''
* A command to control loaded [[data pack]]s.
* Has the following subcommands:
** <code>enable <name></code> - enables the specific pack.
** <code>disable <name></code> - disables the specific pack.
** <code>list [available{{!}}enabled]</code> - lists all data packs, or only the available/enabled ones. Hovering over the data packs in this list shows their description defined in their pack.mcmeta.
* Data packs are enabled by default, but if the player have disabled it they can re-enable it with these commands:
** <code>enable <name></code> - enables the specific pack, putting it in its default position.
** <code>enable <name> first</code> - enables the specific pack, putting it before any other pack (lowest priority).
** <code>enable <name> last</code> - enables the specific pack, putting it after any other pack (highest priority).
** <code>enable <name> before <existing></code> - enables the specific pack, putting it before (lower priority) <existing> pack.
** <code>enable <name> after <existing></code> - enables the specific pack, putting it after (higher priority) <existing> pack.
