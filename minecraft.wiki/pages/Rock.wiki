The entries on this annotated, structured '''list of rocks''' all are items and blocks in ''[[Minecraft]]'' that:
# Are similar to real-world rocks;
# Share a name with real-world rocks;
# Are fictitious but fulfill a similar role to rocks.
A few fictitious blocks are included in this list; namely, [[blackstone]], [[deepslate]], [[End stone]], [[glowstone]], [[netherrack]], and [[redstone]]. Their actual nature is up to the player's imagination.

<!--For simplicity's sake, do not add stonecutter products to this list (stairs, slabs, bricks, etc.)
-->
