'''[[Effect]]s'''<ref name=noexp>{{bug|MC-270954|||Won't Fix}}</ref>
* [[File:Infested JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Infested]]
** Affected entities have a 5% chance to spawn 1&ndash;2 [[silverfish]] when hurt.

** Affected entities spawn two [[slime]]s upon death.
** Slimes cannot get this effect.

** It has a duration of 30 seconds.
** Once the Raid Omen expires, a raid starts at the location the player gained the Raid Omen.
* [[File:Trial Omen JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Trial Omen]]
** A variant that Bad Omen can transform into if the player is within detection range of a [[trial spawner]] that is not ominous.
** The Trial Omen has a duration of 15 minutes multiplied by the transformed Bad Omen's level.

'''[[Enchantments]]'''<ref name=noexp>{{bug|MC-270954|||Won't Fix}}</ref>
* Three new enchantments have been introduced that are unique to the [[mace]].
* [[Breach]]
** Rare enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
** Has 4 levels.
** Maces enchanted with Breach reduce the effectiveness of armor on the target.
*** The effectiveness of the armor is reduced by 15% per Breach level.
* [[Density]]
** Common enchantment, accessible in the [[enchanting table]] and on [[enchanted book]]s in loot.
** Has 5 levels.
** Maces enchanted with Density do more damage per fallen block per Density level.
*** Damage dealt per fallen block is increased by 1 per level of Density.
* [[Wind Burst]]
** Unique enchantment which can only be found in [[ominous vault]]s.
** Has 3 levels.
** Maces enchanted with Wind Burst emit a burst of wind upon hitting an enemy, launching the attacker upward and enabling the linking of smash attacks one after the other.
** Each level bounces the attacker higher up in the air; however any level above the default maximum of 3 obtained through commands makes the player simply lose all downward momentum and begin falling again, without gaining any upward momentum.

=== Command format ===
'''Entity sub-predicates'''
* Added <code>raider</code> sub entity predicate.
** New sub-predicate has been added to match raidersFields:
*** <code>has_raid</code> - Match whether the raider is in an active raid.
*** <code>is_captain</code> - Match whether the raider is a captain.

'''Item stack components'''
* Added <code>item_name</code> item stack component.
** When present, replaces default item name with contained chat component.
** Differences from <code>custom_name</code>:
*** <code>item_name</code> can't be changed or removed in anvil.
*** <code>item_name</code> is not styled with italics when displayed to player.
*** <code>item_name</code> does not show labels where applicable (for example: banner markers, names in item frames).

'''Loot tables'''
* Added new loot table type <code>minecraft:equipment</code>.
** Has required parameters of <code>this_entity</code> and <code>origin</code>. 
*** <code>this_entity</code>: the mob that is about to be given equipment.
*** <code>origin</code>: the position of the mob.
* Added optional <code>equipment_loot_table</code> to the spawn data present in the <code>SpawnPotentials</code> of monster spawners and <code>spawn_potentials</code> of trial spawner configs.
** If present, rolled items from the specified loot table are equipped to the mob that spawns.

=== General ===
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>minecraft:is_player_attack</code> damage type tag: for attacks performed by the player.
* Added the <code>#enchantable/fire_aspect</code>, and <code>#enchantable/sharp_weapon</code> item tags.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cobweb]]'''
* Added unique sounds.

=== Command format ===
'''Item stack components'''
* Non-default components on item stacks containing block items are now stored on block entities when placed.
* Component removals from defaults are currently not preserved.
* Placing and breaking non-block entity blocks remains unchanged - nothing is preserved.
* Does not automatically cause preserved components to be restored on drops - this requires addition of <code>copy_components</code> function to loot table.
* Components are stored in field called <code>components</code>.
** Some components (like <code>custom_name</code>) are still handled by legacy serialization, which means they might not be present in there.
** Contains map of component id to component value.

'''Loot functions'''
* Changed <code>copy_components</code> loot function.
** Removed field <code>components</code> and replaced it with: 
*** <code>include</code> - optional list of data components to be copied from source.
**** If omitted, all components present are included.
*** <code>exclude</code> - optional list of data components to be excluded from copying.
**** If omitted, defaults to empty.
*** Only components that are included (explicitly or implicitly) but not excluded are copied.
* Changed <code>set_name</code> loot function.
** Added optional field <code>target</code> to specify which name should be set.
** Values:
*** <code>custom_name</code> - sets <code>custom_name</code> component (default).
*** <code>item_name</code> - sets <code>item_name</code> component.

=== General ===
'''Chat'''
* Client chat state (on-screen messages and chat input history) is now preserved by client when entering and exiting configuration phase.
* Message signature chain handling remains unchanged - going into configuration phase starts new session.
* If client has message delay configured, pending messages are delivered immediately before leaving world.
* Server can clear chat state by sending <code>reset_chat</code> packet in configuration phase.

'''[[Data pack]]'''
* The data pack version is now <code>37</code>.
* Int and float providers used in worldgen definitions are no longer wrapped in an extra <code>value</code> field next to <code>type</code>
** For example, <code><nowiki>{"type":"minecraft:uniform","value":{"min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}}</nowiki></code> becomes <code>{"type":"minecraft:uniform","min_inclusive":0.0,"max_inclusive":1.0}</code>. 

'''Protocol'''
* The <code>minecraft:chat_command_signed</code> packet has been split from <code>minecraft:chat_command</code>.
** Commands that do not accept any signed arguments use the unsigned packet, and don't pass any 'last seen' chat updates. 

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The resource pack version is now <code>31</code>.
* Added the following particle types: {{cd|d=and|infested|item_cobweb|small_gust|raid_omen|trial_omen|trial_spawner_detection_ominous|ominous_spawning}}.
* Added the following sound events: {{cd|d=and|block.cobweb.break|block.cobweb.step|block.cobweb.place|block.cobweb.hit|block.cobweb.fall|block.trial_spawner.about_to_spawn_item|block.trial_spawner.spawn_item|block.trial_spawner.spawn_item_begin|block.trial_spawner.charge_activate|block.trial_spawner.ambient_charged|item.ominous_bottle.dispose|event.mob_effect.bad_omen|event.mob_effect.trial_omen|event.mob_effect.raid_omen}}.
* Added textures for the following blocks and items: ominous vault, ominous trial spawner, ominous bottle.
* Updated textures for normal vault block.
* Added the following mob effect icon textures: {{cd|d=and|infested|oozing|weaving|wind_charged|raid_omen|trial_omen|bad_omen_121}}.
* Added new models for ominous state of vault block. 

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Fixed the <code>#parrot_poisonous_food</code> item tag to contain <code>cookie</code> instead of <code>carrot</code>.

== Experimental ==
=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[File:Ominous Trial Spawner (active) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Ominous trial spawner]]'''
* A more powerful active phase of the [[trial spawner]] with unique challenges and rewards. 
** Provides a more challenging experience that advanced players can opt into for better rewards.
* A trial spawner becomes ominous when it detects a [[player]] with the [[Trial Omen]] effect if:
** Either it is not in [[Trial Spawner#Cooldown|cooldown]].
** Or, it is in cooldown but was not ominous during its last activation. This bypasses the cooldown.
* While active, it:
** Glows blue instead of orange.
** Emits soul flames instead of normal flames.
** Spawns mobs, usually with equipment if they can wear it.
*** The [[armor]] these mobs wear have [[armor trim]]s applied from the [[trial chambers]].
*** Known issue: these mobs can currently drop their equipment on death, but they will not in the future.
** Periodically spawns potions and projectiles on top of unsuspecting players and mobs. 
*** Based on their location, spawners in an area select a random set of projectiles to spawn.
*** These projectiles always include a single type of [[lingering potion]] from a set of possible status effects.
* Becoming ominous despawns any existing mobs it spawned and resets its challenge.
** It stays ominous until it has been defeated and its cooldown has finished.
* When defeated, it ejects a different set of loot to normal trial spawners.
* An [[ominous trial key]] has a 30% chance of ejecting from a defeated ominous trial spawner, replacing the usual 50% chance to eject a [[trial key]].

'''[[File:Ominous Vault (active) JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Ominous vault]] '''
* A variant of the [[vault]], with a different texture, that emits soul flames instead of normal flames.
* Can be found throughout the [[trial chambers]] in harder to find places.

==== Gameplay ====
'''{{Animate|Bad Omen JE3 BE3.png; Raid Omen JE1.png; Bad Omen JE3 BE3.png; Trial Omen JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Ominous event]]s'''
* Bad Omen has been expanded to give access to an optional experience in trial chambers.
* These optional experiences accessed through Bad Omen are now known as ominous events.
** They are more challenging than usual, and are designed to shake up the experience in unique ways.
** Illager raids are an example of an existing ominous event.
* Bad Omen is getting some changes with this redesign:
** It has a new, shadowy icon and a sound for being applied to the player.
** It no longer triggers a raid directly when entering a village.
*** Instead, it transforms into a Raid Omen variant with a duration of 30 seconds.
*** Once the Raid Omen expires, a raid starts at the location the player gained the Raid Omen.
*** Like any other effect, players can drink a bucket of milk to clear the Raid Omen to prevent the raid from starting.
** It is no longer given to players that defeat a raid captain outside a raid.
*** Instead, players can gain access to Bad Omen by consuming a new ominous bottle.

==== General ==== 
'''[[Tag]]s '''

** Flow banner pattern, flow armor trim smithing template, and heavy core can no longer be obtained.
