'''Skyblock''' is a community created {{MC}} game mode, revolving around constructing a world from minimal resources, typically starting off with an island, a [[chest]], and a single [[tree]].

== Gameplay ==
In typical skyblock, the player spawns on a small floating island made of dirt and grass, which contains only a tree for the player to use for [[wood]] and a chest containing at least the resources for a [[cobblestone generator]] ([[water]]/[[ice]] and [[lava]]), and some [[Seeds#Item|seed]]s to grow food. The challenge is to either sustain oneself using these resources, or, in some variants of the game mode, to venture out onto further islands that may contain the resources necessary to enter [[the Nether]] and [[the End]] to properly complete the game.

== Background ==
The game mode was created by [[Minecraft Forum]] member Noobcrew.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/1473433-surv-skyblock|title=<nowiki>[Surv] Skyblock</nowiki>|author=[https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Noobcrew Noobcrew]|website=[[Minecraft Forum]]|date=September 4, 2011}}</ref> It has gone on to become a prolific genre of content with [[YouTube]]rs such as [[CaptainSparklez]] and [[Technoblade]],<ref>{{YouTube link|Hl41sTALR4c|Minecraft: SkyBlock Survival Ep. 1 - Cobblestone Generator|CaptainSparklez|October 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube link|i3NXPk4ROao|I Became the Mayor of Skyblock|Technoblade|May 26, 2021}}</ref> with many different iterations being created by fans.
