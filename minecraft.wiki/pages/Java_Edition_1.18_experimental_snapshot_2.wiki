'''1.18 Experimental Snapshot 2''' (known as '''1_18_experimental-snapshot-2''' in the launcher) is the second experimental snapshot for [[Java Edition 1.18]], released on July 20, 2021,<ref>{{Mcnet|new-world-generation-java-available-testing|New world generation in Java available for testing|July 20, 2021|Henrik Kniberg}}</ref><ref>{{reddit|oo3pvy/minecraft_118_experimental_snapshot_2_is_out||Minecraft 1.18 experimental snapshot 2 is out!|MrHenrik2|July 20, 2021}}</ref> which makes numerous changes to world generation and mob spawning functionality related to [[monster spawner]]s.

== Additions ==
[[File:Snapshot 1 Map.png|thumb|256px|A map of biome placement in the first snapshot.]]
[[File:Snapshot 2 Map.png|thumb|256px|A map of biome placement in this snaphot.]]

=== General ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* Spawners now have a new {{nbt|compound|CustomeSpawnRules}}{{sic}} tag, which lets players override the spawn rules of the spawned mob.
** In the tag, players can specify {{nbt|int|BlockLightLimit}}, which indicates the highest block-light the spawner spawns mobs at.

== Changes ==
=== Mobs ===
'''General '''
* [[Zombie]], [[skeleton]], [[spider]], and [[cave spider]] spawners now spawn mobs up to block-light level 11.

=== World generation ===
'''[[Beach]]es'''
* Beaches are generally wider.
** In some places there is a chance where no beaches generate at all, to provide some variation.

'''[[Extreme hills]]'''
* Renamed mountains to extreme hills, and gravelly mountains to gravelly hills.

'''[[Mountains]]'''
* Sheep now spawn in meadows.
* Rabbits now spawn more frequently in meadows.
* Donkeys now spawn less frequently in meadows.
* Blue orchid no longer spawns in meadows.
* Meadows sometimes spawn a lone oak or birch, often with a bee nest.
* Hostile mobs now spawn in the new mountain biomes.
* Infested stone now generate in the new mountain biomes.

'''[[Ore]] distribution'''
* Emerald ores now generate in the new mountain biomes.

'''[[Ore vein]]s'''
* Made ore veins slightly larger and more frequent.

'''[[Biome]]s'''
*  [[Ice spikes]], [[eroded badlands]], and [[savanna plateau]] generate naturally.

'''[[Swamp]]'''
* Swamps now generate properly.

'''[[Lush caves]]'''
* Are now slightly smaller and slightly less common.

'''General'''
* Biome placement is a bit smoother and less noisy. Fewer microbiomes dotting the terrain. Biomes tend to be a bit larger and less fragmented.
* Underground biomes interfere less with surface biomes. They can still leak out of cave entrances sometimes.
* Increased the height of some of the peaks.
** Now can rarely reach up to Y=260.
* Slightly increased the chance of finding large areas with flat terrain.
* Structures now mostly show up in the right biomes. 
* Toned down the megacave entrances a little bit, and made them less likely to go all the way down to deepslate level.
* Made cheese caves a little bit smaller on average, and a bit less likely to intersect the surface.
* Reduced the chance of sand and gravel being placed in such a way that they immediately fall down on generation. 
** Some are now replaced with sandstone or stone.

=== General ===
'''[[Cloud]]s'''
* Raised cloud level from 128 to 192.</onlyinclude>
