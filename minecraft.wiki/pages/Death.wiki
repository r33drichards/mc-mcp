'''Death''' is a game mechanic related to [[health]], which occurs when the health of an [[entity]] reaches {{hp|0}}.
[[File:Mob corpses.png|250px|thumb|Mobs leaving red corpses and fire (because of daylight and player-made lightning) in multiplayer.]]

== Occurrence ==
Death occurs usually as the result of taking enough [[damage]].

Setting the maximum health of an entity to {{hp|0}} makes it immediately die.

Executing {{cmd|kill}} causes entities to die immediately, including non-mob entities.

{{IN|java}}, a [[parrot]] dies immediately when it is fed a [[cookie]].

Upon the death of a [[player]], a [[death message]] describing the cause of death is shown in [[chat]] to everyone in that world if the {{gmr|show_death_messages|showdeathmessages}} [[game rule]] is set to {{cd|true}}. The death of a player's pet also creates a death message if the same game rule is set to {{cd|true}}: {{IN|java}}, this is shown only to its owner; {{in|bedrock}}, this is shown to every present player in the [[world]]. {{IN|java}}, the death of a player, villager, or renamed mob is recorded in the game's logs.

When killed, mobs can [[drop]] their [[item]]s and [[experience]] at their location.
* {{IN|Java}}, players and mobs drop their experience immediately.
* {{IN|Bedrock}}, players and mobs first play out their animation (see below), then they [[Particles|turn to dust]] and drop their experience.

== Animation ==
When an entity dies, it performs a death animation, if it has one:
* Players and most mobs fall on their left side to the ground.
* [[Squid]] do not have death animations.
* [[Spider]]s, [[endermite]]s, and [[silverfish]] flip upside-down.
* The [[ender dragon]] flies to the highest dragon-immune block in the (0,0) column,  which is typically the top of the exit portal, and then ascends and explodes.

For players and mobs, the death animation lasts {{convert|20|gt|s}}. After the death animation has completed, the mob or player's body immediately disappears and creates white smoke particles.

{{IN|Java}}, mobs still count toward the [[mob cap]] during their death animation.<ref>{{bug|MC-183240}}</ref>

{{IN|Bedrock}}, [[armor stand]]s have a brief death animation when killed with a [[harming]], [[Wither (effect)|wither]], or [[poison]] potion. {{IN|Java}}, summoning an armor stand with no health causes the death animation.<ref>{{bug|MC-93206|||Won't Fix}}</ref>

{{IN|Education}}, [[tripod camera]]s have a death animation when killed by a potion effect.

== Player effects ==

[[File:Ore UI - Death Screen Menu - Survival and Adventure Mode - You Died (Bedrock).png|thumb|250px|The death screen in [[Survival]] and [[Adventure]] mode {{in|be}}]]

[[File:Ore UI - Death Screen Menu - Hardcore Mode - Game Over (Bedrock).png|thumb|250px|The death screen in [[Hardcore]] mode {{in|be}}]]

For players, a "You Died!" screen (or "Game Over!" in [[Hardcore]] mode) appears, displaying a [[death message]]; {{in|java}}, the player's [[score]] is also displayed. {{IN|Java}}, the view of the world is tinted red, render distance is reduced to default, the camera-view slowly tilts as if falling over, shudders, and zooms in slightly. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the screen is slightly darkened, a maroon vignette appears and closes around the screen, render distance is set to default, camera switches to third-person view and zooms out for the purpose of allowing the player to see their cause of death. The following options appear on the screen:

* Respawn — Respawn, either in the last [[bed]] the [[player]] interacted with, at their [[world spawn point|default spawn point]] (their first spawn point in the game), their [[respawn anchor]], or at the spawn point [[World Spawn#Individual spawn|set by commands]]. In [[Hardcore]] mode, the player can [[respawn]] only in [[Spectator]] mode, and cannot continue because [[cheats]] are disabled.
* Title Screen — Return to the [[title screen]].

The death screen is not shown upon death if:

* The player holds a [[totem of undying]] in the main hand or off-hand and died without falling into the [[void]], in which case the player resurrects upon death. Resurrection does not happen if the player fell into the void.
* The [[game rule]] {{gmr|immediate_respawn|doimmediaterespawn}} is set to {{cd|true}}, in which case the player instantly respawns upon death without the death screen appearing, but still shows death message.

Any items or blocks that were in the player's [[inventory]] (except items enchanted with [[Curse of Vanishing]]) are [[drop]]ped from their head, and scattered around the spot where the player died (unless the game rule {{gmr|keep_inventory|keepinventory}} is set to {{cd|true}}). Like any dropped item, these drops decay after five minutes while that [[chunk]] is loaded.

The player also loses any [[experience]] accumulated, reverting the level back to 0 (unless the game rule {{gmr|keep_inventory|keepinventory}} is set to {{cd|true}}) and drops experience orbs with a precise total value of ''player last level'' × 7 ''experience points'' (with a maximum of 100). After reaching level 15, the player always drops only 100 [[Experience|experience points]] regardless of level.

The player also loses all [[effect]]s upon respawning, even when the game rule {{gmr|keep_inventory|keepinventory}} is set to {{cd|true}}.<ref>{{bug|MC-67352|||WAI}}</ref>

{{IN|java}}, despite the fact that dead players disappear like all other mobs, it is still possible for the player to see their own hand while in the first-person mode.<ref name=:0>{{bug|MC-88781||Hand visible in death screen after player entity despawns|WF}}</ref>
