== Small House ==

[[File:OakHouse.png|thumb|Small House (Plains, Old)]]

This house has the walk-on roof. Never spawns with a door (confirmed using a custom flatland level with village size and proximity set to extremes, giving tons of examples of every building to examine). Sometimes spawns as a variant with no ladders and no fences.
