The '''badlands''' or '''mesa''' are arid-land mountainuous [[biomes]], featuring [[red sand]] and mounds of [[terracotta]] bands, coming in various colors.

== Description ==
Badlands biomes feature large mounds of [[terracotta]] bands, in layers of various colors; specifically, red, orange, yellow, white, light gray, brown, and regular terracotta may all naturally generate. At high altitudes, the topmost layer of stained terracotta is often weathered into regular terracotta, most often on plateau tops. At low altitudes, the terrain surface is weathered into a layer of [[red sand]] (or [[red sandstone]] if floating), with orange terracotta under it extending to Y=63. The underwater surface is covered with a layer of orange terracotta, and in shallow water, sometimes interspersed with some white terracotta; in deep water, sometimes interspersed with some [[gravel]].

Badlands biomes can usually be found bordering [[desert]]s, and they usually do not border [[ocean]]s, but they can also generate by the ocean in areas with mountain peaks. Badlands biomes can border [[Wooded Badlands|wooded badlands]], [[savanna]]s, [[savanna plateau]]s, [[forest]]s, [[plains]], and can generate close to [[jungle]]s. Normal badlands and [[Eroded Badlands|eroded badlands]] often appear on the two banks of a river, or on the two sides of a valley without a river. Badlands can also generate in [[Mountains|mountain]] peaks, where they can elevate up to Y=256 and rarely border [[Stony Peaks|stony peaks]].

[[Cacti]] and [[dead bush]]es generate frequently across the landscape, similarly to [[desert]]s, but dead bushes are more common than in deserts, and cacti are rarer. [[Sugar cane]]s may generate along water. Cacti have a chance of generating a [[Cactus Flower|cactus flower]] on top.

[[Mineshaft]]s generate at much higher elevations in these biomes, often exposed to fresh air. Their supporting [[planks]] and [[fence]]s are made of dark oak rather than oak. Additionally, extra [[gold ore]] generates up to elevation Y=255 (rather than the normal Y=32), and at much higher rates than the rest of the world, making badlands tunnels excellent sources of gold. [[Ruined Portal|Ruined portals]] can generate as well.

While all badlands biomes are rich in unique [[Terracotta|building materials]] and [[gold ore]], [[armadillos]] and warm animal variants are the only [[passive mobs]] that can spawn in it, though animals can only spawn on player-created [[grass blocks]]. The player should also be careful when exploring underground; as a highland biome, the [[Deep Dark|deep dark]] can generate underneath badlands.

Badlands biomes never [[rain]], meaning [[lightning]] strikes are impossible. The exceptions are the [[river]]s that cut through the badlands, where it can still rain and cast lightning.

The colors of specific [[terracotta]] layers in these biomes are almost the same throughout all badlands biomes for any particular world. Each world seed generates 192 layers of terracotta for each Y-coordinate to pick from<ref>layers[(noiseValue + Y + 192) % 192]</ref>. At each horizontal coordinate, each layer may shift up and down by at most ±7 blocks based on a noise.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], badlands have unique atmospherics, lighting, and color grading which appears dry and yellow with slightly more color than deserts, although they use default volumetric [[fog]].

==Issues==
{{issue list|Badlands|Mesa}}

== Trivia ==
*Regular oak mineshafts do not generate in the badlands biomes, but they can generate into one if a neighboring biome generates the mineshaft.
*Although dark oak mineshafts generate in badlands, dark oaks do not grow in this biome.
*If a badlands biome generates above y level 256, it generates orange terracotta as the default rather than undyed terracotta. This cannot be seen through normal gameplay as the game cuts off any terrain above y level 256, however it can be seen on ''[[Java Edition]]'' using an [[amplified]] world.
