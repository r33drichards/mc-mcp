'''14w27b''' is the thirty-third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.8]], released on July 2, 2014,<ref>{{cite|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708105022/https://mojang.com/2014/07/minecraft-snapshot-14w27a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 14w27b|date=July 2, 2014|website=Mojang.com|author=[[Dinnerbone]]}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|484375685960450048|Minecraft snapshot 14w27b has been released!|July 2, 2014}}</ref> to fix some bugs and crashes in the [[14w27a]] snapshot.

14w27b was reuploaded as the original version featured an incorrect version label of '14w27<u>a</u>'.<ref>{{tweet|makzk_|484376757123158016|The window title and the version on the title screen still says "14w27a"|July 2, 2014}}</ref>

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Block models]]'''
* The block state files now support an array of models allowing for random models.
** As a result of this, [[grass block]]s, [[dirt]], [[sand]], [[red sand]], [[stone]], [[netherrack]], [[bedrock]], and [[TNT]] all have their top texture randomly rotated.
