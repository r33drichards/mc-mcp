'''Potato sprouts''' are a joke [[block]] added in [[24w14potato]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Potato sprouts can be broken instantly using anything, including the player's fist, and always drop themselves as an item.

=== Natural generation ===
Potato sprouts generate commonly on the surface of a [[corruption]] biome in the [[Potato dimension]].

=== Post-generation ===
When [[potato leaves]] decay, or are broken by any tool except [[shears]], they have a 5% chance of dropping potato sprouts. The [[Fortune]] enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II, and 10% at level III.

== Usage ==
If placed on [[peelgrass block]]s or [[corrupted peelgrass block]]s, potato sprouts can grow into [[potato tree]]s. Potato sprouts function similarly to [[Nether fungi]]: they don't grow into trees on their own, [[bone meal]] must be applied.

Potato sprouts are randomly offset based on the coordinates of the block they are placed on, which can be used to create unusual hitbox patterns.
