A '''displacement wand''' is an item introduced in [[25w14craftmine]]. Its description reads: "Jera Isaz Berkanan".

== Obtaining ==
The Displacement Wand is only obtainable without commands if the player gets the upgrade "Enigma", by default this upgrade is obfuscated, however if the player defeats an enderman the upgrade will be readable.

Upgrading in this order is necessary to get the Displacement Wand: Crafting → Pockets → Enchanting → Magic Kit → Master Magic Kit → Runemaster → Enigma

== Usage ==
The displacement wand shoots out a special [[ender pearl]] when used. It has different properties to the normal one, instead of going on a curved trajectory, it goes on a straight line when shot, as well as when the player gets teleported, they don't take [[damage]].
