A '''stick''' is an item used for [[crafting]] many [[tool]]s and [[item]]s.

== Obtaining ==

}}
Crafting a stick using bamboo planks requires 2.25 bamboo per stick (because 9 bamboo are required to make 2 bamboo planks), which is less efficient than crafting a stick directly from 2 sticks of bamboo.

}}

=== Fishing ===

Sticks can be obtained as a "junk" item while [[fishing]].

=== Block loot ===

[[Dead bush]]es drop between 0–2 sticks when destroyed.

All [[leaf]] types have a 2% chance to drop 1–2 sticks when they decay or when broken using a tool without [[Silk Touch]]. Using a tool with [[Fortune]] increases these chances to 2.2%, 2.5%, and 3.3% for Fortune I, II, and III respectively.

== Trivia ==

* The stick is used in 49 recipes in ''Java Edition'', and 50 recipes in ''Bedrock Edition'', more than any other item in the game. [[Iron ingot]] takes second place with 35 recipes, and [[planks]] take third place with 34 recipes.
* To craft each recipe once, a player would need 111 sticks, including 1 for the [[redstone torch]] in an [[activator rail]], while using the extra tripwire hook for the [[crossbow]]. This would require 56 [[planks]], or 14 [[logs]], for the sticks, and an extra 29 planks for the [[tool|wooden tools]], [[tripwire hook]], [[signs]], [[fences]], [[fence gate]], [[grindstone]], and slabs for the [[barrel]]. This means that the player needs a total of 85 planks, or 22 logs, plus 6 more for the [[campfire]] and [[soul campfire]].
