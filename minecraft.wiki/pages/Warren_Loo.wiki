'''Warren 'EvilSeph' Loo''' is a game developer who formerly worked for [[Mojang Studios]]. The former leader of the [[mcservers:Bukkit|Bukkit]] team, Loo was hired by Mojang to maintain the ''[[Minecraft]]'' servers and develop the official mod API. Before this was complete, his job capacity was broadened, to include general development. He announced his departure from Mojang on October 2, 2013, stating that he was looking to pursue other interests.<ref>{{tweet|EvilSeph|385537792794959872|Had a great time working for Mojang but it's time for me to pursue other interests. As of yesterday, I am no longer working for Mojang.|October 2, 2013}}</ref>

On August 21, 2014, he announced that the Bukkit project would be discontinued due to undisclosed reasons, citing changes to the Minecraft EULA and poor support from Mojang as contributing factors.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140821103657/http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/bukkit-its-time-to-say.305106/</ref> This decision was later reversed by Mojang claiming to own the project.<ref>{{tweet|jeb_|502380018216206336|Warren over at bukkit seems to have forgotten that the project was bought by Mojang over two years ago, and isn't his to discontinue.|August 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|502389963606867968|To make this clear: Mojang owns Bukkit.
