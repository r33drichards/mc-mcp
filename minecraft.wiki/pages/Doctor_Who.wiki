'''''Doctor Who'' x ''Minecraft'''''<ref>{{Cite|url=https://www.bbcstudiosgamesandinteractive.com/portfolio/doctor-who-minecraft|title=Doctor Who x Minecraft|author=BBC Studios Games & Interactive|website=www.bbcstudiosgamesandinteractive.com|date=August 12, 2020}}</ref> is a collaboration between ''[[Minecraft]]'' and the ''{{Wikipedia|Doctor Who}}'' television franchise, primarily released a year after the 50th anniversary of the TV show. The collaboration added two Legacy Console Edition skin packs in 2014.

== Background ==
''Doctor Who'' is a British science fiction television show created by the BBC which first aired in November 1963. The stories follow the Doctor, an alien called a Time Lord, and his companions who travel in the TARDIS (Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space). It can travel through space and time and is disguised as a 1960s blue police box. It is also known to be bigger on the inside than the outside

The original series known as "classic" Doctor Who aired 1963–1989. Classic Doctor Who includes the first seven Doctors. The TV show's eventual decline led to suspension in 1989. A 1996 TV movie, which Introduced Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor, helped keep the brand alive during the “Wilderness Years.” BBC Wales, with the help of Russell T. Davies, revived the series in 2005. The show continued the continuity from the classic series and the movie. The 50th anniversary special was in 2013 with the episode "The Day of the Doctor". The episode introduced the War Doctor and celebrated the franchise.

Doctor Who is one of the longest‑running and most influential sci‑fi franchises. In Minecraft, the franchise appeared in two Legacy Console Edition skin packs (2014 and 2015), featuring all Doctors up to the Twelfth, new and old companions, and villains from the show.
