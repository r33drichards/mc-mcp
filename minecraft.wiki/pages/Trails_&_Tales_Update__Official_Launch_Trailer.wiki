'''Trails & Tales Update: Official Launch Trailer''' is a trailer made to promote the [[Trails & Tales]] update, showing four stories of the game's heroes going on different adventures.

== Summary ==
[[Steve]] is reading a [[book]] on a [[lectern]], before leaping off to adventure and putting on [[trimmed]] [[armor]]. Meanwhile, [[Ari]] is walking in a [[desert]] with a [[brush]], [[Alex]] is wearing a different set of trimmed armor in a desert [[cave]], and [[Zuri]] is escorting a [[sniffer egg]] through a [[cherry grove]]. Steve opens a hidden door from a [[chiseled bookshelf]], rushing off into a waterfall with a [[trident]]. They consider riding a [[camel]], before venturing out to an [[Ocean monument]] and slaying an [[elder guardian]] for its [[tide armor trim]].

Ari is then shown brushing [[suspicious sand]] and almost excavating a [[skull pottery sherd]], but a horde of monsters emerge from the [[sand]] from behind. As Ari runs away, Alex emerges along with them and runs off to their [[camel]]. Luckily for Ari, the monsters burn in daylight. In a cherry grove, Zuri has hatched a number of [[sniffers]], and is busy working on a house. Alex then arrives and is greeted by Zuri from the roof of the build, while a calf and [[snifflet]] become acquainted. Hard cut to Steve on a cliff in a [[storm]], almost falling off as a [[creeper]] creeps behind them. As Steve is creeped out and inches closer to the edge, the creeper becomes [[Charged Creeper|charged]]. In the nick of time, Alex arrives riding the camel, and saves them by dashing off the cliff. Safe and sound, Steve and Alex return to the beach where Steve was based, petting the camel calf. Meanwhile, Ari returns to a desert base with the sherd and crafts a [[pot]], Zuri hangs a [[hanging sign]], and Alex places a [[skull]] on a [[note block]].

Steve pulls a book out of another chiseled bookshelf, before pulling out another, opening a door into a [[dripstone cave]]. Rushing in they pull out their sword and start battling with the monsters in the cave.

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|The Trails & Tales Update brings your stories to life! Ride a camel with a companion to find archeological sites or a cherry grove. Hatch a sniffer egg to bring it back from extinction. Create playable mob sounds, craft with bamboo, trim your armor, and hang your signs. Write and store your books in the chiseled bookshelf, because every story matters!|YouTube description}}{{Quote|In this trailer we get to follow four individual characters on four different journeys in the Minecraft world, showcasing how Minecraft can be played in a multitude of ways. Steve is on a never-ending search for action, sometimes biting off more than he can chew. Ari is role-playing an archaeologist on the look-out for ancient pottery shards in the desert. Zuri has settled down in a quiet cherry grove and built a magnificent sniffer sanctuary, whilst Alex acts like the explorer binding the individuals trails together. On her quest collecting mob heads, she travels vast distances, bumping into the other players along the road.|Behance description<ref name="behancetales">https://www.behance.net/gallery/176743459/Minecraft-Trails-Tales</ref>}}

== Trivia ==

* During production, there was an added section of Zuri's Sniffer Sanctuary, referred to by [[Samuel Fast Hurtigkarl]] as a "Sniffer Spa." However, it ended up not being visible in the trailer itself.<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samuelfast_minecraft-behindthescenes-gametrailers-activity-7093205339893841921-dr5C?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop</ref>
* While animating the trailer, Brikk Animation had to put a considerable effort into the position of the sun, specifically mentioning wanting Ari to be "nicely lit in each shot," and undead mobs burning in sunlight.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/brikk.se/posts/pfbid02UjiLR3rbnALJJnaQ55HvLwwkcVTjyAQvKk2KgSq1TDReM52RtjKbFGoBd7RPU8MNl</ref>
