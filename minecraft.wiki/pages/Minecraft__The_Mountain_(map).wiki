'''Minecraft: The Mountain''' is a [[Marketplace]] map developed by ''[[Blockception]]'' that promotes the official {{MC}} [[Minecraft Novels|novel]] of the [[Minecraft: The Mountain|same name]].

== Summary ==
The map begins in an info room set inside a [[compass]], floating above a recreation of [[the Island (location)|the Island]], visible through [[stained glass]]. The player directly faces an [[entity]] of the book the map is based off, in front of the book's cover and notices of the book's availability. On the walls are promotions for the developers' [https://x.com/blockception Twitter], [https://www.facebook.com/Blockception/ Facebook], [https://www.instagram.com/blockception/ Instagram], and [https://www.youtube.com/blockception YouTube] accounts. Upon approaching the book, the player will be propelled into the [[paper]] and begin the story.
=== Foreign Land ===
A narrator recaps the story of [[Guy]], a figure who spawned in the [[ocean]] and has now left the Island in search of answers. Players begin the narrative in a [[boat]], with only an [[iron sword]], 28 [[steak]]s, an [[iron shovel]], a compass, and a set of [[iron armor]]. The first objective is to simply go west, rowing through a [[cold ocean]] around [[iceberg]]s up to a [[snowy beach]]. Upon making it to shore, the player has to climb up [[snow]], where four [[zombie]]s spawn and ambush the player. After defeating those, four [[stray]]s spawn in their place.

Upon defeating the strays, a much larger group of monsters appear, the player being encouraged to flee. Crossing over a [[frozen river]], players will stumble upon a weak spot in the ground, falling into a [[canyon]]. Behind a [[spring]] is a [[torch]], which leads down a [[cobblestone stairs|stairway]] to an underground chamber, holding a [[bed]], [[furnaces]], [[chests]], [[bookshelves]], and [[stone bricks]]. On an [[anvil]] is a [[book]], a journal to be exact, which gives backstory to the area. Progressing outside a [[spruce door]] leads to a strip mined tunnel leads back to the outside, where the narrative player eyes [[lava]], coming from the titular [[mountain]].

Reaching the top of the mountain reveals the lava to be unnaturally wide, covering a side of the mountain, with a single [[poppy]] on nearby [[dirt]]. Digging the dirt reveals a [[lever]] under the flower, which when {{control|used}} triggers a cinematic revealing [[The Mountain]], as the lava vanishes.

=== The Mountain ===
Behind the lava are a set of doors, which when opened reveal en expansive corridor made of [[polished andesite]]. Two levers are placed next to the doors, one reactivating the lava, the other turning on [[redstone lamps]] throughout the hall. Beneath an [[armor stand]] wearing [[gold armor]] is a second journal from Guy and [[Summer]], explaining that they are giving the Mountain to whoever finds it, and that it has several tasks left to be fulfilled. A door on the right leads to a command room, with [[double chest]]s, a [[fletching table]], a [[cartography table]], a [[jukebox]], and [[tools]] in [[item frames]]. Another room to the left is a bedroom, with a [[bricks|brick]] [[campfire|fireplace]] with a display of [[chainmail armor]] and gray beds, a second journal from Guy alone sitting on the floor.

The player is tasked with lighting up the fortress, with a lever on a [[spruce log]] pillar in the command room and next to the door in the "luxury hotel" bedroom. To the left of the command room is a bathroom, with a working "hot tub," the light switch placed next to a [[Graham]] [[painting]]. Behind the [[workstations]] in the command room is a lever that opens "binds," in the form of [[gravel]] being pushed up and down by [[piston]]s. Beyond those rooms is a main chamber, three stories tall, with a light switch and maintenance switch next to its entrance. Going down to the first floor and passing by several indoor farms, the player finds a fully stocked kitchen lined with [[jungle log]]s, where a journal written by Summer is found. She tasks the player with finding 8 [[pumpkins]], 18 [[melon slices]], 32 [[carrots]] and [[potatoes]], and 64 [[beetroots]].

9 carrots, 12 beetroots, and 14 potatoes can be found in chests inside the kitchen, while 7 pumpkins are inside a [[barrel]] in a closet. The remaining crops can be culled in the nearby farm, the closest to the kitchen being melons. Upon collecting the required foods, the player is instructed to find 24 of each [[mushroom]], which are found in a room on the opposite side of the main chamber. Entering the hall, players can find another light switch and gold armor display, as well as a double chest holding several unreadable books. The mushrooms can be found inside of a dark room lined with [[redstone torches]], growing off [[stone]]. Passing by a chest full of paper, the player is brought to a [[chicken]] coop, where they must cull 5 [[raw chicken]].

After collecting all the harvest, the player is ordered to enter the "Tool Room," which is across from the kitchen. Inside the Tool Room is another task from Summer, this time to trek to an [[igloo]] near a [[river]] for supplies. The igloo can be found west of the Mountain, identifiable by a [[cobblestone wall|chimney]] and [[cauldron|well]]. Inside is a third journal from Guy, and then instructions to collect 3 [[rabbit hide]]s, 3 [[raw rabbit]]s, 5 [[mutton]]s, 5 [[leather]], and 5 [[raw beef]], found in various chests inside the igloo. Upon collecting all the needed items, monsters will begin to spawn outside, including zombies, strays, and [[spiders]], incentivizing the player to rest until morning.

=== The Ice Cube ===
Upon waking up, the player is ordered to investigate a mysterious room in the Mountain locked with [[iron door]]s, a pair of [[flint and steel]] appearing in the player's inventory overnight. Sure enough, behind the doors is a [[nether portal]], with a third task from Summer below. Entering [[the Nether]], the player will find themselves in a [[basalt delta]], with a path of [[nether bricks]] and [[soul lanterns]]. Traversing [[blackstone]] and avoiding [[magma blocks]] leads the player to an expansive bridge, passing by a [[zombified piglin]] and at the end [[the Ice Cube]].

Feeling a change in temperature, the player will try to loot the building, requiring 4 [[ghast tear]]s, 8 [[magma cream]]s, 32 [[blaze rod]]s, 32 [[glowstone dust]]s, and 32 [[nether warts]]. Upon collecting the resources needed for [[potions]], the player character overhears a [[ghast]], and is so terrified that they decide to return to the [[Overworld]]. On the way back, the player runs into several [[piglins]] and [[piglin brutes]].

=== Epilogue ===
Upon returning to the Mountain, a hidden area, the "Collector's Room" is opened inside the building. At the entrance are several [[hoppers]], marked with items, and a final task from Summer. Upon collecting the book, the player is now allowed to continue the map in [[survival mode]], with the incentive to find the needed items to open a secret door in the Collector's Room. The ideas needed include [[polished blackstone bricks]], an [[eye of ender]], [[quartz stairs]], an [[empty map]], a book, and a [[diamond]].

The fetch quest allows the player to explore previously unnecessary areas of the Mountain. Advancing up a stairway connected to the kitchen and Tool Room is a master bedroom, with a jukebox, hanging [[lanterns]], a map of the surrounding area, and a journal written by Summer of her perspective on meeting Guy. On the opposite side of the bedroom is an entrance to the third floor of the Mountain, which includes a potion lab with [[flower pot|potted]] [[Nether fungi]] and an automated [[brewing stand]]. Close by on the stairway is a master bathroom lined with [[polished granite]].

Upon collecting all 6 items, the [[chiseled stone brick]] door will open, revealing a treasure chamber containing items such as [[nether gold ore]], [[dried kelp block]]s, [[bamboo]], and [[blocks of emerald]]. In several barrels lie uncommon items, such as [[coral]], [[honey bottle]]s, and [[bottles o' enchanting]]. At the end is a final book from Summer, and next to it a double chest holding [[diamond armor]] and a [[block of diamond]].

{{Quote|A thrilling adventure map inspired by the all-new novel Minecraft: The Mountain by [[Max Brooks]], bestselling author of Minecraft: The Island! Explore the world from the book and the mountain base that Guy and Summer leave behind. Defeat mobs, complete mini-games, and complete a scavenger hunt to unlock the rewards that will make their base your own!|Minecraft Marketplace description}}{{Quote|When you go into the map, it’s way after Summer and Guy have moved on, so the mountain you’re seeing is not exactly as it was in the book. Actually, that was another huge challenge. I was two-thirds of the way through writing The Mountain and I sat down to play the game, and the whole Nether had changed, top to bottom! But instead of getting angry, I realized that was probably the greatest life lesson! When the world changes, you gotta change with it.|Max Brooks describing the plot of the map<ref name=":interview" />}}

=== Internal ===
{{Quote|If you've found yourself here, then you may know about the strange, block-built world around you.<br>
Our adventurer spawned in the ocean, all alone.<br>
Learning to survive on an island not only taught them about this world but also about themselves.<br>
And, if you didn't know that, now you do.<br>
But enough of the past. Let's talk about the here and now.<br>
Our journey starts with venturing west to find answers.<br>
Where did our adventurer go? You'll be following in their footsteps.<br>
Somewhere out there must be answers to my questions... your questions.<br>
That's why you've left the comfort of the Island.<br>
Who knows what you will find or discover? Here is where your journey begins.|Opening narration}}
{{Quote|What are you?! At least you're not trying to attack me.|The player's reaction to Bacon Bits}}

=== Books ===
{{Quote|Cold!<br>
Again!<br>
Digging wasn't a conscious thought, just pure instinct. How many times in the past had burrowing saved my life?<br>
A short time later, I had a hollowed-out bunker. With cobblestone sealed up behind me, I set my torches on the wall, my bed back on the smooth, hard floor, and jumped right in for a good night's rest.<br>
Safer and warmer.|''Journal 1'' by Guy |image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|Welcome to the place we called home. Now you may wish to call it your home. We just ask you to respect these walls and imbue your skills & knowledge you have learnt along the way into this space.<br>
Before we let you have free reign of the place, there are several tasks that will need to be completed to help the upkeep. There will be signs in the room where the tasks are located.<br>
P.S. the whole place is rigged with lighting. You can turn everything on with the switches on the walls. Cool right?|''Welcome'' by Guy & Summer|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|Body warmed and belly full, I slipped between the soft, comforting blankets of my bed, staring at the 'whiffy' fire as sleep wrapped me in protective arms.<br>
"I'm not alone anymore," I yawned, closing my eyes,<br>
"I'm not alone."|''Journal 2'' by Guy|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|Hey, you've found the kitchen. Here we cooked up eveyrthing from rabbit stew to double chocolate chip cookies. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we did<br>
We became entirely self-sufficient with our own crops & even chickens.<br>
It might have been a while since any harvesting was done through so can you please go around to the farm, coup and mushroom room and harvest & replant.<br>
You'll need these supplies from this chest to do everything.|''First Task'' by Summer|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|Hey, welcome to the tool room. You can see on the walls we have one of everything, from pickaxes to helmets.<br>
All this takes a lot of work, and sometimes we have to go hunting & gathering.<br>
I discovered a hunting igloo towards the western river where I used to stash supplies & rest before going out again.<br>
I'm pretty sure there are still a bunch of supplies left there. Head over there and bring some of them back.<br>
Becareful about going there near sundown.<br>
It's further to travel than it looks...<br>
Good luck!|''Second Task'' by Summer|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|Cold.<br>
The feeling changed everything.<br>
Running with all my might, leaping in, slamming the door behind me, and looking in amazement at this tiny, semi-frunished room!<br>
A crafting table, a furnace, even a bed and, wouldn't you know it, carpet!<br>
White wool carpet I almost mistook for snow.<br>
And there were windows, too. Windows of ice that I'd missed from the outside because they must have been blocked by falling snow.|''Journal 3'' by Guy|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|If you're reading this, then you survived. YOU SURVIVED!<br>
Against all the odds stacked against you, you made it out: not to get all soppy but we're really proud of you.<br>
If you feel up it there's one final task to be completed in the mountain. When I was there, I collected rare items, all sorts of things.<br>
A few of these might be tricky to make, but I promise there's an awesome reward if you get all 6.|''Final Task'' by Summer|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|Well, today didn't go as I'd planned.<br>
There I was, out for supplies, when I stumble on a person hiding away in my hunting cabin.<br>
A whole other thinking, breathing human being. Well, the blocky version of a human.<br>
Boy, does he ask questions like it's going out of fashion. Did he not read the same books I did?<br>
It was nice to show off all my work to someone though.<br>
OH, I almost forgot, we gave each other names! I called him "Guy," and he called me "Summer".<br>
I'm Summer.|''Journal 1'' by Summer|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}
{{Quote|This strange blocky world has taught us lessons we never thought we would learn.<br>
We even have a Fresson List, incase you're wondering: a friendship-lesson.<br>
We've learnt that the most crucial thing is not giving up on yourself & even more importantly, each other.|''Well Done'' by Summer|image=The Mountain book drop.png}}

== Trivia ==
* Although never part of the map's narrative, [[Bacon Bits]], a [[zombified piglin]] character from the novel, is present in the Mountain with a [[name tag]] and unique dialogue from the player character, reacting in horror.
** Curiously, the character can appear as both an adult or child.{{Needs testing}}
*Although the map parallels Guy's discovery of the Mountain, down to taking the same route to it, the player character is an unnamed third entity. Similarly, the story of the map is set "well after" Guy and Summer had moved out, so it's not necessarily the same as they had left it.<ref name=":interview">{{Mcnet|the-mountain|The Mountain|March 2, 2021|[[Alex Wiltshire]]}}</ref>
