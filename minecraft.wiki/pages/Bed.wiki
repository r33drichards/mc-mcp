A '''bed''' is a [[dyeable]] utility [[block]] that allows a [[player]] in the [[Overworld]] to sleep through the [[night]] and reset their [[spawn point]] to within a few blocks of the bed, as long as it is not broken or obstructed.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of bed.<ref>{{bug|MC-192722||Beds have no assigned tool}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Bed|sprite=all-beds|any}}
Bed drops itself when it's destroyed.

=== Natural generation ===
'''Igloo'''
* A red bed naturally generates in each [[igloo]].

'''Village'''
* Beds of various colors generate in [[village]] houses, depending on the specific structure and [[biome]]:
** [[Village#Desert|Desert village]] houses have cyan, green, or lime beds.
** [[Village#Plains|Plains village]] houses have white or yellow beds.
** [[Village#Savanna|Savanna village]] houses have orange, red, or yellow beds.
** [[Village#Snowy|Snowy taiga]]{{only|bedrock|short=1}} and [[Village#Taiga|taiga village]] houses have blue or purple beds.
** [[Village#Snowy|Snowy tundra village]] houses have blue, red, or white beds.

'''Trial chambers'''
* Beds can generate inside the [[trial chambers]] as any color inside various intersections. Each bed has its color randomized.

[[File:Ore UI - Sleep Screen Animation (Bedrock).gif|380px|thumb|Player falling asleep {{in|be}}.]]

Beds are used by pressing the {{control|use item}} button while looking at the bed.

A player sleeps by {{control|using|using}} a bed during a [[thunderstorm]], or at [[night]] (between 12523 and 23477 ticks in clear weather, when stars appear in the sky, or between 12002 and 23998 ticks in rainy weather). Players can sleep during a thunderstorm even if they are in a biome where it does not rain (e.g. desert). Attempting to use a bed at any other time results in the message "You can sleep only at night or during thunderstorms" {{in|Java}} or "You can only sleep at night and during thunderstorms" {{in|Bedrock}}. A player sleeps in a bed for 101 in-game [[tick]]s, or 5.05 seconds before the time skips to the next day. Sleeping in a bed with the {{cmd|gamerule doDaylightCycle}} set to <code>false</code> results in the player being kicked out of the bed after the 101 ticks, but does not change time of the world to day.

Sleeping in a bed is possible only in the [[Overworld]]. Attempting to sleep in a bed in [[the Nether]], [[the End]], and [[custom dimension]]s{{only|java|short=1}} in which they are disabled causes it to [[explode]] and set [[fire]] to surrounding blocks.<ref>{{bug|mcpe-28723||Exploding bed in the Nether!?|WAI}} This is referenced {{in|Java}} when a player is killed by "Intentional Game Design".</ref> The explosion has power 5, which is stronger than [[TNT]] (4), but not as strong as a charged [[creeper]] or [[end crystal]] (6). The explosion centers on the head part of the bed. [[Villager]]s can sleep normally in any dimension without the bed being blown up.<ref name="villager">{{bug|MC-146515||Villagers can sleep in all dimensions|WAI}}</ref> Upon death from a bed explosion, the [[Death messages|message]] "'''(Player) was killed by <span class="minetip" title=MCPE-28723>{{bug|MCPE-28723|[Intentional Game Design]}}</span>'''" appears. {{IN|Bedrock}}, bed explosions can be disabled by setting {{cmd|gamerule respawnBlocksExplode}} to <code>false</code>; this still prevents beds to be used in invalid dimensions.

The player must be close to the bed to sleep. If the player is close enough to interact with the bed, but not close enough to sleep in it, the message "You may not rest now, the bed is too far away" {{in|Java}} or "Bed is too far away" {{in|Bedrock}} appears. To use a bed, a player must be within a distance of 3 blocks {{in|Java}} or 2 blocks {{in|Bedrock}} from the bed.

If a [[monster]] is within 8 blocks of the bed head horizontally (in the X- and Z-axis), and 5 blocks vertically (in the Y-axis), the message "You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby" appears and the player is prevented from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed. Most hostile mobs, as well as some neutral mobs prevent players from sleeping, as shown in the table below.

If the player has not entered a bed and didn't die for 3 in-game days, [[phantom]]s can spawn unless {{cmd|gamerule doInsomnia}} is set to {{cd|false}}. {{IN|Java}}, this can be verified by checking if the "Time Since Last Rest" [[statistic]] is greater than 1.00 h.

Taking damage from any source while in a bed causes the player to wake; this means players cannot sleep while on fire, while poisoned, or while starving, because the damage wakes them before they can fully fall asleep. Attacks from [[PVP|other players]] and hostile mobs also wake the player in this way, although the latter is rarely seen due to hostile mobs typically preventing the bed from being entered in the first place.

The player also cannot sleep in a bed occupied by another player, resulting in the message, "This bed is occupied".

A player can, however, sleep in a bed being used by a villager. The player may first wake the villager (pressing {{control|use}} on the villager) and then quickly enter the bed before the villager can lie down again. The villager reclaims the bed after the player wakes. The villager is kicked out of its bed when a player attempts to sleep there.

If all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player is positioned in the bed. The player falls asleep as the screen fades to black. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into bed.

Once all players in a world are asleep, after 5 seconds (100 ticks) the time of day changes to sunrise. (time 0)

During this time, the chat window is focused, and the player can leave the bed by clicking the {{btn|Leave Bed}} button.

[[Waterlogging|Waterlog]]ged beds{{only|bedrock}} cannot be slept in unless the player or villager has the {{EffectLink|Water Breathing}} or {{EffectLink|Conduit Power}} status effects. Attempting to use a waterlogged bed otherwise does not display any message.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-35802||Attempting to use a waterlogged bed without the Conduit Power/Water Breathing effect will not give an error message}}</ref>

{{IN|java}}, beds displaying an error above the hotbar is a feature exclusive to beds. {{IN|Bedrock}}, the bed sends the message in the [[chat]]; other blocks that cannot be used do not display such a message.<ref>{{bug|MC-160479||Attempting to use an obstructed bed gives an error message above the hotbar but attempting to use an obstructed chest or shulker box does not|WAI}}</ref>

The process for determining where to put the player after waking up is the same as for determining where to respawn the player after death (see below). The player attempting to sleep in a bed with no suitable wakeup positions (achievable by interacting with the bed from underneath it), such that the player will suffocate upon waking up, will result in the message "This bed is obstructed". The player always wakes up facing the head of the bed. 

Villagers always wake up on top of the bed, meaning they can suffocate if there isn't enough room above the bed.

==== Passing the night ====
Sleeping changes the [[Daylight cycle|time of day]] to sunrise and resets the [[weather]] cycle, changing the weather to clear conditions. {{IN|Java}}, the weather cycle resets only during rainy or snowy weather.

Sleeping does not accelerate processes that take place over time such as the growth of [[crops]] or [[smelting]].

To skip the night in multiplayer, all players in the [[Overworld]] must be in bed at the same time. Pressing the {{btn|Leave Bed}} button is not necessary in this case. The percentage of players that need to sleep to skip the night can be customized with the game rule {{cd|playersSleepingPercentage}}. Sleeping in a bed while {{cd|playersSleepingPercentage}} is set to higher than 100 displays the message "No amount of rest can pass this night." and disables passing the night.

Villagers are unable to skip the night by sleeping in beds, unlike players.

Players and villagers do not drown or take damage from lava while in a bed, even if the bed is covered in lava. However, if the bed is destroyed while the player is in it, due to for example an explosion or by another player, the player wakes prematurely and the night does not pass.

{{IN|bedrock}}, on [[Peaceful]] difficulty only, sleeping in a bed fully restores the player's [[health]].

==== Setting the spawn point ====
Once a player has entered a bed (or right clicked the bed during daytime), their spawn point is set to the location of that bed. Multiple players can set their spawn point on a single bed.

{{ctrl|Using}} a bed in the daytime likewise sets the spawn point, without actually entering the bed. 

When a bed explodes, it does not set the spawn point. 

The message "Respawn point set" is displayed in chat when the respawn point is successfully changed.

The check for a bed is made only when the player respawns. This means that the bed can be destroyed and replaced or even reoriented, but as long as there is a bed present in the same location, the player can respawn there. If a player's bed is absent, or if the area around the bed is made unsuitable for respawning (see below), a message is displayed saying "You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed" {{in|Java}} or "Your home bed was missing or obstructed" {{in|Bedrock}}, and the player respawns at the [[world spawn]] point. 

When choosing where to respawn the player, the two blocks to the immediate left and right of the head of the bed are considered first. Which block is chosen between the two corresponds to which direction the player was facing when they last interacted with the bed to set their spawn point; For example, a bed facing west will respawn the player on the south side of the bed if they are facing towards the north while setting their spawn point, and vice versa. If the player is perfectly aligned with the bed when the spawn point is set, the right side of the bed takes priority. Interacting with the bed again will still update which side of the bed is chosen for respawning, even if the location of the spawn point itself does not change. 

Once a side is chosen, if the block immediately on the chosen side of the head of the bed is obstructed, the next block to be checked is chosen moving in a clockwise (right side) or counterclockwise (left side) direction around the bed. If all of the 10 blocks immediately adjacent to the bed are obstructed, the block above the head of the bed is checked, followed by the block above the foot of the bed. The player is always respawned facing the head of the bed, the same as for waking up. 

For a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again. 

Specifically, when interacting with it, the location of the ''head'' of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works. This can be observed by reorienting the bed with its head in the same location. Interacting with it does not produce a "Respawn point set" message as the game doesn't change the saved spawn point. If a bed is reoriented so that its foot is in this space, it still functions on the next respawn, but it can also be interacted with to update the spawn point to the new head of the bed and cause a "Respawn point set" message. Attempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn. However, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved. If the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning. It is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way.

=== Bouncing ===
Falling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength – the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity. The player also takes less [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]] when bouncing on a bed. The player's fall distance is set to 50% of the actual distance fallen, which results in the player taking half of the normal fall damage.

Baby villagers bounce on beds during the day.

If the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses {{control|use}} on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes.

A player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up.

Villagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.

=== Curing ===
Each bed in the vicinity of a zombie villager has a chance to speed up the [[Zombie Villager#Curing|process of curing the zombie villager]]. [[Iron bars]] (such as in a prison cell) also have this effect.

=== Placement ===
Beds require two blocks of floor space. Placement requires at least 2 blocks from the player's facing direction. When placed, the foot of the bed is placed on the block selected and the head of the bed on the block farther away from the player. {{IN|Bedrock}}, beds require solid blocks below them when placed. However, the bed remains in place if its supporting blocks are later removed. They also cannot be placed on transparent blocks. {{IN|Java}}, beds do not require supporting blocks and can be placed anywhere, provided there is enough room.

=== Explosions ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Ancient Debris#The bed method|Tutorial:Defeating the Ender Dragon#Beds}}
Because beds explode when a player attempts to sleep in [[the Nether]] or [[the End]], they can be used as any other explosion, to demolish blocks or deal damage, with the advantage of being extremely cheap compared to [[TNT]] or [[end crystal]]s, and being instantaneous. Explosions can be used, for example, to mine for [[ancient debris]] or to kill the [[ender dragon]]. 

{{IN|Bedrock}}, beds do not explode if {{cd|[[commands/gamerule|/gamerule]] respawnBlocksExplode}} is set to {{cd|false}}.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Beds are destroyed when a [[piston]] tries to push them. They are not pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.

|The ability to leave beds is currently only intentionally available in multiplayer. However, in singleplayer it is possible for the player to aim at the bed they are sleeping in by moving the mouse in the right way, and then break it, which will forcibly wake them up.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The reason beds explode in the Nether and the End is because Notch found it was the easiest solution to dimension-unique respawning.<ref>{{tweet|Notch|1259681657793077250|duh|11 May 2020}}, in response to {{tweet|NoahBandito|1259681319392550912|So you're telling me the "Inteded Game Design" should actually be "Sorry, I was too lazy to code"?|11 May 2020}}</ref>
** Dimension-unique respawning was eventually implemented via the [[respawn anchor]], and gained command support at the same time. Despite this, beds and respawn anchors still explode in invalid dimensions.
* If the player quits the game while sleeping, upon return the player wakes up beside the bed.
* Using the {{cmd|teleport}} command while another player is sleeping still teleports the sleeping player, but the player wakes immediately.{{only|java}}
* If the player places a bed on [[ice]], running over the bed acts like running over ice, similar to slabs.
* When placed using the {{cmd|setblock}} command, only one half of a bed is placed, because beds are two blocks long. A single half can be slept in like a whole bed.
* Villagers can sleep in the Nether and the End without causing the bed to explode.<ref name="villager"/>
* While the block state used to determine the half of a two-block block such as [[door]]s and double-tall [[flower]]s is called ''half'', in the case of beds this is called ''part''.
* The red bed was the original default bed color. In [[Java Edition 1.12]] and [[Pocket Edition 1.1.0]] version of the game, the default color was changed to white.
* This is the only item to have a 3D inventory texture in [[Java Edition]], but a 2D texture in [[Bedrock Edition]].
