A '''new thing banner pattern''' is a joke [[banner pattern]] from [[Java Edition 23w13a_or_b]]. It is used to customize [[banner]]s with a symbol that is based on an orientation of the M from the [[Mojang Studios|Mojang]] logo, which resembles an abstraction of a crewmate from ''[[w:Among Us|Among Us]]''.
