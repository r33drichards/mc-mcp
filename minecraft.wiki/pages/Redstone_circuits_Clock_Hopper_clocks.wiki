= THIS IS A STAGIN/TEST PAGE =
I want to re-organize the hopper timer page/circuits.
Currently, with only nearly all schematics separated in a single sub-page, it's terrible and I for one wont add any new variations in this mess.

My aim is a small general technical overview of hopper clocks on the clocks page with image gallery of the clocks and this subpage either just as a subpage or in a loadbox (or both?)

== Single-item hopper clocks ==

A '''single-item hopper clock''' simply moves a single item in a loop of hoppers.

A '''multi-item hopper clock''' achieves longer clock periods by using multiple items in the hoppers, and using a latch to keep the items flowing first one way then the other (rather than just bouncing back and forth between two hoppers).

For most of the multi-item hopper clocks, see the ''Items Required for Common Clock Periods'' table (right).

:When the items finish moving in one direction, the empty hopper's comparator turns off, allowing the associated sticky piston to pull the block of redstone to the other hopper, reversing the direction of item movement. The movement of the block of redstone also updates the other sticky piston (which has been powered for a while) causing it to extend and prevent the first sticky piston from extending again when its comparator turns back on.

:Powering the hoppers will freeze the clock. Powering one of the blocks or the redstone dust will allow the clock to finish its current cycle before halting.

:There are a number of useful outputs from this clock:
:* ''Normal output:'' a regular on/off clock signal can be taken from one position of the block of redstone. The signal will last for half the clock period.
:* ''Comparator output:'' taking the output from one of the comparators results into an on-pulse that's <code>[(n-1)*8+2]*2-2</code>gt{{only|java|short=1}} | <code>[(n-1)*8+4]*2-2</code>gt{{only|bedrock|short=1}} long and an off-pulse that's 2gt(1rt) long (when there's more than one item in the clock).

: The repeaters in the middle keep the bottom hopper clock from transferring items except for the brief period when the top hopper clock reverses direction. Thus, the bottom hopper clock will transfer 1 item every time the top hopper clock completes a full cycle (except when the bottom clock reverses direction, when the bottom clock transfers an item after only half a cycle).

: The bottom clock will have a clock period of X × (2Y - 1) × 0.8 seconds, where X is the number of items in the top clock and Y is the number of items in the bottom clock (both max. 320 items).

Once per cycle, the block of redstone will move left and activate both of the droppers in the second stage (the left dropper is powered directly, while the right dropper is activated because it's next to a powered block: the left dropper). The block of redstone in the second stage ensures that only one dropper will actually push an item, forcing the items to move in one direction until the block of redstone moves.

: The dropper clock multiplier will have a clock period of X × Y × 1.6 seconds, where X is the number of items in the hoppers (max. 320 items) and Y is the number of items in the droppers (max. 576 items).

: ''Variations:'' The most compact version of this circuit (2×6×4 = 48 block volume) can be achieved by moving the first stage above the second stage, and rotated 180°, with a single piece of redstone on one of the droppers. Each additional dropper stage should be rotated 180° to the one above.

: Each additional dropper stage can multiply the previous stage's clock period by up to 1,152 (twice the number of items a dropper can hold). Adding just one additional dropper stage increases the maximum clock period to over 10 years. In practice, this may only be needed for clock periods measured in weeks or months (longer than the 2-stage version can provide), generally on servers.

=== Multiplicative Hopper-Latch Clock (MHLC) ===
[[File:2-stage mhlc.png|thumb|'''Multiplicative Hopper-Latch Clock''']]
: 4×5×3 (60 block volume)
: silent
: ''clock period:'' up to 81.9 hours (3.4 real-life days)

: The MHLC uses [[#hopper-latch_hopper_clock|hopper-latch hopper clocks]] for each stage, replacing the top hoppers in the secondary stage with droppers, and connecting the stages with a comparator to pulse the secondary stage.

: The MHLC uses the same number of items as the [[#mhdc|MHDC]] for the same clock periods, with a similar volume, but is silent.

: ''Variations:'' Each additional dropper stage can multiply the previous stage's clock period by up to 1,152 (twice the number of items a dropper can hold).
