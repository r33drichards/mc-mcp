'''Tyler''' '''Collins''', also known by his username '''TYLER-the-MAGE''', is the main character of the [[Minecraft (Dark Horse Comics)|Minecraft]] graphic novel series.

== Appearance ==
Tyler is a young child typically seen wearing indigo clothing, and a pair of round glasses. His skin is dark, with a round nose, thick eyebrows, and a hi-top fade. In the real world, he is commonly seen wearing a hoodie, worn over a school uniform, consisting of a pine green buttoned shirt and neck tie, with a white buttoned undershirt. While playing games, he wears a muted purple headset, with pinkish white highlights and a visible microphone.

In {{MC}}, he is represented by a fantastical version of his real self, as opposed to a traditional [[skin]]. His hoodie is exchanged for a cloaked outfit, with four different pockets, navy blue sleeves with yellow trims, black pants, and gilded boots similar to [[Efe]]. On his waist is a sash on top of strings resembling those on his hoodie, with a satchel holding a [[sword]]. On his wristband is a mechanical wristband, which appears to embody the in-game [[chat]].

== Personality ==
{{Expand section}}
From his introduction, Tyler is shown to deeply care for his friends, seemingly once being inseparable from them. Since moving away from their hometown they've only been able to regularly meet through {{MC}}, and thus deeply values their adventures. 

Tyler is an avid fan of ''Minecraft'', playing regularly and owning several pieces of memorabilia, including a [[creeper]] poster, a drawing of a [[sheep]], a mug of the [[Overworld]], and a creeper keychain. He is also a fan of a fictional comic book known as [[Catman]], and has an interest in dinosaurs, as well as astronomy.

== Powers and abilities ==
{{Expand section}}
During the first issue of the series, Tyler displays the ability to completely kill a [[Wither (Dark Horse Comics)|wither]], using nothing more than a single strike from a [[diamond sword]] by slicing it vertically in half. As the [[wither]] has a minimum health of {{Hp|300}} and maximum of {{Hp|600}}, this would mean Tyler owns a sword stronger than any that exists in the base game.

== Biography ==
{{Expand section}}
At some point in the past, Tyler discovered a [[server]] by the name of the [[Ever Realm]], where he played with several of his [[The Gang|friends]]. However, his family ended up moving away to another state across the country.

After his first day at the new school, he returned home to find his [[Tyler's mother|mother]] unpacking their belongings. She asked how it was, but he declines to talk, wanting to go up to his room and reconnect with his friends. He logs into the server, and quickly updates his friend group chat to tell them he's heading to their [[Hibiscus House|base]], reaching it via [[ender pearl]]. Upon arriving, he discovers his friends have prepared a surprise party for him, welcoming him back into the server; this was their first time seeing him since he moved. He's delighted to see them again, and gets quickly asked about his new situation, annoyed about the school and its uniform policy.

In an effort to cheer him up, [[Evan]] offers to show him the group's current projects. He becomes very impressed with their work, but is even more surprised to learn that they've acquired a second [[wither skeleton skull]], hoping to create a [[Wither (Dark Horse Comics)|wither]]. However, by the time they reach the arena he has to leave to bed. By the time he logs back on, he's shocked to discover the wither already constructed, and swoops in at the last minute to save [[Candace]] from it. Although his friends try to explain the situation, he takes this as them trying to reach a milestone without him, and he logs off upset.

An unknown amount of time passes, Tyler neglecting to respond to text messages from Evan. However, he eventually relents as  he insists he needs him for something important. He discovers a [[sign]] telling him to go up to the balcony, and when he reaches there discovers an incomplete [[beacon]], Evan offering to let him finish it. 

== Relationships ==

=== Evan ===
Tyler and Evan are shown to be good friends, frequently chatting over The Gang group chat. When Tyler is lead to believe his friends made in-game progress without him, he becomes immediately heartbroken, seemingly putting most of the blame on Evan. In truth, Evan had been forced to complete the wither against his will, being manipulated by tentacles emerging from the soul sand. It's unclear if Tyler had known about this or simply had suspicions. After exiting the server angry, Evan continued to text him again and again, until he egged him into discovering their beacon.
