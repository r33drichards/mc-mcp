'''19w09a''' is the twenty-fourth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.14]], released on February 27, 2019<ref>{{snap|19w09a|February 27, 2019}}</ref>, which adds new [[note block]] sounds.

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Note Block JE2 BE2.png|32px]] [[Note block]]s'''
* Five new note block sounds have been added: "iron xylophone", "cow bell", "didgeridoo", "bit", and "banjo".
** The new sounds can be heard by using [[iron block]]s, [[soul sand]], [[pumpkin]]s, [[emerald block]]s, and [[hay bale]]s respectively.
* A previously unused note block sound has now been fully implemented: "pling".
** Can be played using [[glowstone]].

=== General ===
'''Sounds'''
* Added two new sounds for [[wandering trader]]s drinking Invisibility potions and milk.

'''Tags'''
* Added <code>minecraft:arrows</code> item tag.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Blocks of quartz]]'''
* Now uses the top texture on both the top and bottom face.

'''[[Crops]]'''
* The blocks that have to be lit up for growth and survivability of wheat, carrots, potatoes, and beetroots have been merged into a single one. Previously, the block above the crop dictated growth and the crop's block itself dictated survivability, both being merged now into the crop's block.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Pillager]]s'''
* Can now use [[tipped arrow]]s and [[firework]]s in their offhand when shooting their crossbow.

'''[[Fox]]es'''
* The effects of certain food items such as [[chorus fruit]]s and [[spider eye]]s now apply to foxes when the fox consumes them.
* Now attack [[tropical fish]] and [[pufferfish]].

=== General ===
'''[[Particles (Java Edition)|Particles]]'''
* Sprites for particles can now be configured in resource packs.
