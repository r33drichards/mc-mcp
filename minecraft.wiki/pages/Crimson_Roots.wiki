'''Crimson roots''' are a non-solid "plant" block that generate naturally on [[nylium]] and [[soul soil]] in few [[Nether]] biomes. They resemble a colony of tall, thin mushrooms.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Crimson roots can be [[instant mining|mined instantly]] with any tool. They drop themselves when broken. Flower pots containing crimson roots drop both the flower pot and crimson roots when broken.

=== Natural generation ===
Crimson roots generate often in the [[crimson forest]] biome and rarely in the [[warped forest]] biome and in the [[soul sand valley]] biome.

{{block distribution}}

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding crimson roots drops the block upon death.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|crimson-roots}}

=== Post-generation ===
Applying [[bone meal]] to [[crimson nylium]] causes crimson roots to appear on nearby crimson or [[warped nylium]]. There is also a low chance for bone meal applied to warped nylium to generate crimson roots.

== Usage ==
=== Decoration ===
[[File:RootsSproutsPlaceBlock.png|thumb|All of the blocks that crimson roots can be placed on.]]
Crimson roots are decorative blocks. They can be planted on the same blocks that [[crimson fungi]] can be placed on. Crimson roots can be planted in a [[flower pot]], which gives them a different texture.

=== Composting ===
Crimson roots can also be used on a [[composter]], with a 65% chance of increasing the level by 1.
