'''Minecon Live: Rush Race!''' is a  [[Marketplace]] map made as part of [[Minecon Live 2019|''Minecon Live 2019'']], centered around a race through various ''Minecraft'' locations.

== Summary ==
The map begins in a miniature hub world or info room, containing controls for the map and small bonuses. Below the map's logo is a picture of the [[fancy graphics]] and [[field of view|FOV]] Can Be Altered By Gameplay options in the [[menu]], reminding players to activate them if not already turned on. Underneath that are several [[buttons]] marked by [[signs]], including options for normal and "PRO" difficulty, and the ability to see the [[scoreboard]] for either. At the bottom of the wall are promotions for Everbloom Games' [https://www.youtube.com/c/everbloomgames YouTube], [https://www.instagram.com/everbloomgames/ Instagram], [https://www.facebook.com/everbloomgames/ Facebook], and [https://x.com/everbloomgames/ Twitter] accounts.

On the left side of the room is a promotion for Everbloom Games' other projects, in the form of a search bar with their name in it. On the right side is a link to their bug tracker, while on the back is a button to reset high scores, a notice to leave a rating for the map, and [[chests]] containing [[books]] holding the credits.
=== Normal ===
Upon entering the race, the player will find themself in a molten cave, surrounded by [[lava]], [[magma block]]s and [[black concrete]]. If they desire to exit the minigame, there is a button behind them that can end the match, but if they commit they can approach [[iron bars]] and begin the race. After the race begins and an announcer declares the name of the section, several [[creepers]] will fall down with parachutes and [[explode]] on top of a [[nether quartz|quartz]] bridge, turning it into a platforming challenge. The section ends by entering a ring of [[note block]]s, leading into a room designed like the inside of a [[jukebox]], where many [[parrots]] are dancing to a song, with [[music discs]] laying on the ground.

Exiting the jukebox leads to a [[magenta concrete]] tunnel, leading to a white [[horse]]. The name of the section is given, as many [[ravagers]] rush forward, while [[villagers]] cheer by jumping up and down on nearby bleachers. The goal of the section is to win a race against the ravagers, first being propelled by [[slime blocks]] up to a [[wool]] statue of a [[pig]]'s face with [[wither skeleton skull]] eyes. Jumping off more slime into a [[sheep]]'s head leads to a [[mineshaft]] with branching paths.

Above the two paths is a [[shepherd]] on a bridge, seemingly cornered by several [[zombies]], with other villagers continue cheering in the background. The paths reunite near immediately, with the left going underneath the track while the right is a curve, the former showing a comedic sight of one ravager stuck bouncing between several slime blocks. The player will use a similar device to pass through a mock [[nether portal]] into fortress with [[red nether brick]] roads. Passing by a third set of villagers and propelled up by more slime, players will leave the Nether to enter a cave made of [[blue ice]], passing by an [[enderman]]. From there the player will enter into a technicolor, swirling tunnel back into the raceway, now filled by several [[skeletons]] who all get shot by [[arrows]] and fall apart.

At the end of the raceway is Whack-a-Fox, a parody of [[w:Whack-a-Mole]]. Several [[foxes]] will sprout out of [[dirt]], with players expected to {{control|hit}} at least five. If they hit [[chickens]], which also appear, they will lose a point. Once the game is cleared, players can enter into a mineshaft infested with [[cobweb]]s, given a [[diamond pickaxe]] and instructed to {{control|mine}} a single [[stone]] block, "digging straight down." Doing this will send the player down an expansive tunnel, passing by mobs such as [[spider]]s and a [[witch]], leading to a [[stronghold]]-like area where endermen dynamically build a [[End Gateway (block)|portal]] out of [[stone bricks]] and [[polished andesite]]. Entering it will end the map.

=== PRO ===
Pro difficulty is very similar to the Normal difficulty, however with added difficulty. This version of the race begins very similarly, with the player in the same chasm, given the same options. However, when Creeper Chasm begins, the creepers will be [[charged creeper]]s, and continue to fall down during the platforming. Once the player begins Ravager Run, they will be riding a pig instead of a horse, although without a [[carrot on a stick]], behaving identical to the horse.

When the player enters the sheep head, the right path will be closed by [[cobblestone|debris]], forcing the player to take the left. The path will now lead to a [[gravel]] wall, which will collapse and lead the player into the [[End]]. The are is a cross between the center island and [[end cities]], with villagers continuing to spectate. A ravager will die, before the player enters back into the Nether. The ice cave and rainbow tunnel perform near identically, if not exactly the same.

The Whack-a-Fox reprise is similar, but harder due to a higher number of holes, effectively every single spot they could be on the walls. Once the player digs down in the mine, they will fall into a pool of lava, the narrator laughing manically and saying "never dig straight down!" The track will end the same way.
