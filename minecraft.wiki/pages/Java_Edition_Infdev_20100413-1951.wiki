A version of '''[[Minecraft Infdev]]''' was released on '''April 13, 2010''', announced by Notch at 19:51 UTC.<ref>[[#logs|IRC logs]]: "(15:51:10) <Notch> I think infdev's been updated"..."(15:52:13) <revenant> nice new trees Notch..."</ref> It was announced on [[The Word of Notch|TWoN]] at 19:59 UTC<ref>[[wordofnotch:518911403|Infdev update, time to sleep]] – The Word of Notch, April 13, 2010</ref>, by which time the [[Java Edition Infdev 20100413-1953|next version]] had already been released.

== Additions ==
=== World generation ===
''' General '''
* The world generator has been updated to include [[sand]] and [[gravel]] [[beach]]es, as well as [[erosion]]s.

'''[[File:Notch-Tumblr-Newtrees.jpg|32px]] [[Oak|Fancy Tree]]'''
* Big [[tree]]s from Paul Spooner's script have been added.<ref>[http://www.peripheralarbor.com/minecraft/minecraftscriptphotojournal.html Paul Spooner's Minecraft Scripting Story]</ref><ref>[[wordofnotch:506311060|Still going slow, but here's a new screenshot!]] – The Word of Notch, April 8, 2010</ref>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Oak Leaves JE2.png|32px]] [[Leaves]]'''
* No longer decay.

=== Items ===
[[File:Arrow JE2 BE1.png|32px]] '''[[Arrow]]s'''
* [[Arrow]]s no longer spawn [[mob]]s upon hitting [[block]]s.

=== World generation ===
'''[[File:Oak JE3.png|32px]] [[Tree]]s'''
* Naturally generated small trees now have a different shape as they are in fact the smallest possible large tree.

== Technical ==
'''[[Debug screen]]'''
* "All" and "Counted" have been added.
** "All" displays the total of loaded entities.
** "Counted" seemingly does the same.

'''Level format'''
* Removed the player's {{nbt|string|id}}:LocalPlayer tag.

== Fixes ==
'''6 bugs fixed'''
* Blocks can no longer be placed in the same space as the [[player]].
* Placing blocks would sometimes cause two blocks to be placed, this has been fixed.
* Lighting code has been fixed. Light level in some areas used be too dark, unless block updated. This fix only applies to newly generated chunks.
* Dying in-game now doesn't leave the body, which doesn't leave until the player relogs into the world.
* Pressing the respawn button multiple times now doesn't spawn multiple players, which can't be controlled anymore.
* Saplings can now grow into small trees again.

== Bugs ==
'''5 bugs reported'''
* Placing [[torch]]es, [[sapling]]s and [[flower]]s crashes the game.
* Pressing F5 results in water particles surrounding the player. Apparently, this seems to happen only when the player is at the same layer as the water. One possible explanation for why this glitch occurs is possibly due to some remaining code from previous versions where F5 used to toggle rain.
* Placing [[sand]] or [[gravel]] above the [[lava]] void causes the lava to go up to where that block is.
* Random lag spikes happen when updating chunks.
* As a result of the player now being removed from the level after death, the player's <code>deathTime</code> stops being incremented causing the death tilt and zoom to stop after a few seconds. This was never fixed and is one of the oldest bugs in the game.
