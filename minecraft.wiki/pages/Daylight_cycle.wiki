[[File:Day Night.gif|320px|thumb|right|A time-lapse of the daylight cycle.]]

The '''daylight cycle''' is a 20-minute-long cycle between two main [[light]] settings: day and night.

== Behavior ==
During the daylight cycle, the [[sun]] and [[moon]] appear to rotate around the player, appearing directly overhead at midday and midnight, respectively. The sun and moon always remain in the same position relative to the [[stars]], and to each other. Solar eclipses are therefore impossible, and technically the moon would constantly be eclipsed by the world, even though it exhibits phases depending on the number of nights elapsed. 

The daylight cycle pauses when a single-player game is paused, but it does not when a GUI window (such as the inventory) is opened. In multiplayer, time proceeds normally as long as the server is running.

The daylight cycle continues while the player is in [[the Nether]] or [[The End]], although the world itself does not change until the [[Overworld]] is loaded again. A [[village]] created in another dimension observes a normal village schedule.

== Conversions ==
In ''[[Minecraft]]'', time is approximately 72 times faster than normal time. This can be easily calculated as the proportion {{frac|1440|20}} = 72, since there are 1440 minutes (86400 seconds) in a real day (3600sec × 24hr) and 20 minutes (1200 seconds) in a full ''Minecraft'' day, assuming the [[tick]] speed is maintained at 20 ticks/second. A collection of time unit conversions is listed below:[[File:Day Night Clock 24h.png|240px|thumb|right|A chart showing the approximations of Minecraft time to real time.]]

{{Anchor|Day}}
=== Daytime ===
[[File:Survival.png|thumb|right|300px|This is the start of a new day.]]

Daytime, not including sunset and sunrise, is equal in length to nighttime, lasting 9 minutes and 10 seconds.

* Start: 1000 ticks (07:00:00.0)
* Mid: 6000 ticks (12:00:00.0)
* End: 12000 ticks (18:00:00.0)

When a [[player]] first [[World Spawn|spawn]]s in [[singleplayer]], the daylight cycle always starts at the beginning of the daytime (0:00). Most [[multiplayer]] servers also start at the beginning of the daytime, but the daylight cycle continues regardless of any new players joining.

During the daytime, the [[sun]] rises up to its peak in a light blue sky. The exact color of the sky depends on the current [[biome]]; for example, [[desert]] skies are a lighter shade of blue than [[plains]] skies. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], biomes have more unique sky colors and sunlight is also colored depending on the biome. The [[moon]] is not visible below the world during daytime {{In|be}}.

All blocks that are in direct vertical view of the sky receive sunlight at the [[internal sky light]] level 15, which is the maximum. Sunlight provides ample light for the growth of [[sapling]]s and [[grass block]]s. Most [[undead]] mobs (including [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s) exposed to direct sunlight (and are not in shade, in [[water]], or wearing [[helmet]]s) are set on fire. Additionally, sunlight renders [[spider]]s neutral, unless they are currently chasing a [[player]], and any [[endermen]] exposed to sunlight teleport randomly when near the player and randomly become neutral if having been aggressive for at least 30 seconds. For more details see [[Effects of light|Light § Effects of light]].

{{Anchor|Dusk|Sunset}}

=== Sunset/dusk ===
[[File:A sunset.png|300px|thumb|Example sunset seen from a high spot on the map.]]

Sunset is the period between daytime and nighttime, and always lasts 50 seconds.

*Start: 12000 ticks (18:00:00.0)
*End: 13000 ticks (19:00:00.0)

During sunset, the sun descends on the western horizon, and the [[moon]] rises on the eastern horizon. The sky and [[clouds]]{{Only|be|short=1}} near the setting sun turn into a vibrant orange-red, which is a set region of the sky {{In|je}}, or the whole horizon while the camera is facing near the sun {{In|be}}. With Vibrant Visuals, more different sky and sun colors are applied depending on the biome. The [[internal sky light]] level decreases. Eventually, undead mobs exposed to direct sunlight are set not to burn.

Between dusk and dawn, players may sleep in a [[bed]]. In singleplayer mode, doing so advances the daylight cycle to dawn and sets the [[weather]] to clear. This also occurs in multiplayer as long as every player online is in a bed simultaneously. Time does not pass for other aspects of the world, however; for example, crops do not grow and [[furnace]]s do not cook or smelt as they would when players are awake.

{{Anchor|Night}}
[[File:TundraNight.png|300px|thumb|A snowy tundra biome during the night; various mobs can be seen.]]
=== Nighttime ===
{{Redirect|Night|night in ''Minecraft Dungeons''|MCD:Night}}Nighttime lasts 9 minutes and 10 seconds.

*Start: 13000 ticks (19:00:00.0)
*Mid: 18000 ticks (00:00:00.0)
*End: 24000 ticks (06:00:00.0)

During the night, the moon rises to its peak in a dark blue sky dotted with small white [[stars]], while the sun isn't visible below the world in ''Bedrock Edition''. The stars appear to move with the moon and can be first seen toward the end of the sunset.

During the nighttime, the world is covered in darkness; the [[internal sky light]] level falls to a minimum of 4, which allows [[hostile mob]]s to spawn on the surface. The exact duration for which hostile mobs are able to spawn in exposed areas is 13188 ticks.<ref group="note" name="spawn-before-redstone" />

Regardless of the low [[internal sky light]] level, crops continue to grow during the night as long as they have sufficient [[client light|client]]{{Only|short=1|Java}} or [[Internal light level|internal]]{{Only|short=1|Bedrock}} light level, and at least one player is not sleeping to avoid skipping the night.<ref group="note">The percentage of players that need to be asleep to skip a night is controlled by the gamerule {{cd|playersSleepingPercentage}}.</ref>

[[File:Sunrise.png|300px|thumb|Example of the sun rising in the horizon.]]

{{Anchor|Dawn|Sunrise}}

=== Sunrise/dawn ===
{{Distinguish|Movie:Dawn Runcie}}
Sunrise is the period between nighttime and daytime, and always lasts 50 seconds.

*Start: 0 ticks (06:00:00.0)
*End: 1000 ticks (07:00:00.0)

During sunrise, the moon sets on the western horizon and the sun rises on the eastern horizon. The same graphical effects are applied to the sky as with sunset, but in reverse.

The [[internal sky light]] level increases. Eventually, the effects of sunlight return, dissipating the threat of most hostile mobs.

== Clocks ==
[[File:WatchCycle.gif|class=pixel-image drop-shadow-dark|right|100px|Clock animation]]
{{main|Clock}}

A [[clock]] allows players to determine ''Minecraft'' time. A clock is useful while underground where the current day/night cycle is not visible, as they can help the player avoid mistakenly surfacing at night and falling prey to night-spawned mobs on the surface.

Clocks spin uselessly in [[the Nether]] and [[the End]], because there is no daylight cycle in those [[dimension]]s.

== Commands ==
If [[commands]] are enabled, then it is possible to change the current time with the {{cmd|time}} commands, as detailed below. To enable or disable the daylight cycle, use the following command: {{cmd|gamerule advance_time}}{{only|JE|short=1}}{{cmd|gamerule dodaylightcycle}}{{only|BE|short=1}} {{cd|true{{!}}false}}

=== Set time ===
Specific times can be set with the {{cmd|time set}} command.

: Syntax: <code>'''/time''' set <''number''{{!}}day{{!}}noon{{!}}sunset{{!}}night{{!}}midnight{{!}}sunrise></code>

Examples:
:{{cmd|time set 0}} – Sets the time to the beginning of the Minecraft day.
:{{cmd|time set day}} – Sets the time to 1000.
:{{cmd|time set 12000}} – Sets the time to dusk/sunset.
:{{cmd|time set sunrise}}{{only|bedrock}} - Sets the time to 23000.
:{{cmd|time set noon}} - Sets the time to 6000.

=== Moon phases ===
Each day that progresses adds 24000 ticks to the time counter. While each day looks the same, the [[Moon]] appears in one of eight different phases each night. The phase of the moon can also alter some events in game such as [[Slime]] spawning and [[Spider]] effects. Although there is no explicit command to change the Moon's phase, using {{cmd|time add 24000}} advances the Moon to its next phase. Using {{cmd|/time set midnight}} also sets the moon's phase to full moon no matter what. Furthermore, any of the phases can be accessed with the use of one of the following commands:

*{{cmd|time set 14000}} – Full moon
*{{cmd|time set 38000}} – Waning gibbous
* {{cmd|time set 62000}} – Third quarter
*{{cmd|time set 86000}} – Waning crescent
*{{cmd|time set 110000}} – New moon
*{{cmd|time set 134000}} – Waxing crescent
*{{cmd|time set 158000}} – First quarter
*{{cmd|time set 182000}} – Waxing gibbous

== Trivia ==
*The sun and moon are both visible when standing or [[flying]] at a height above the terrain at approximately 1.4× the set render distance.
*The highest value of time that can be set with the {{cmd|time set}} command is 2,147,483,647 (2<sup>31</sup>−1; the 32-bit integer limit). This is equivalent to 89478 days and 11647 ticks. A real-time equivalent counting from January 1, 1 [[Wikipedia:Common era|CE]]<ref group="note">There was no [[Wikipedia:Year zero|year 0]], the year starts at 1.</ref> would be December 25, 1581 CE at 11:28:58.8 (or January 1, 1582 CE at 17:28:58.8 if leap years are ignored).
*In [[A Minecraft Movie]], while [[Movie:Steve|Steve]] was resting in his wool house, his narration describes the day as about "20 minutes".
*Using NBT editors, the largest time value that can be set is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (2<sup>63</sup>−1; the 64-bit integer limit). After this point, the value overflows to be &minus;2<sup>63</sup>, at which point the morning and evening horizon swap and the daylight cycle progresses backward. Undead mobs burn at night instead at day. At this time, 384,307,168,202,282 days, 7 hours, 48 minutes and 25.2 Minecraft seconds would have elapsed, or 14,613,851,231 real-life years.
