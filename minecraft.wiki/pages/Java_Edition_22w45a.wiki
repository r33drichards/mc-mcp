== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Scaffolding]]'''

'''[[Vex]]'''

=== Gameplay ===
'''Creative inventory'''
* The textures for the tabs are now skinnier.
* Operator-only items now appear in a new "Operator Utilities" tab if the player has both the "Operator Items Tab" option in controls menu set to <code>ON</code> and the required operator permissions.
** The tab is hidden if operator permissions are lost while inventory is open.
** Now also includes [[structure block]]s and all light levels of [[light block]]s.
* Added a "Colored Blocks" tab.
** Contains all blocks with 16 color variants.
** Moved all colored blocks from "Building Blocks" tab to this tab instead to make that tab less sizeable.
* "Consumables" tab has been renamed to "Food & Drinks" tab to have a more straightforward name.
* "Crafting" tab has been renamed to "Ingredients" tab since not all items are used in crafting.
* Reordered:
** Natural blocks
*** More consistency between types for the top section.
*** Moved eggs to be between seeds and single-block plants.
*** Placed climbable plants above double-block plants.
** Food & drinks
*** Cooked versions of raw food are now right next to each other.
** Redstone blocks
*** Less cluttered.
*** Higher importance items up the top.
*** Removed variants of [[boat with chest]]s, [[button]]s, [[door]]s, [[fence gate]]s, [[pressure plate]]s and [[trapdoor]]s that don't have any functional difference.
** Ingredients
*** Placed lapis in the same order as ore blocks.
* Moved [[bottle o' enchanting]] from the "Tools & Utilities" tab to the ingredients tab next to enchanting books.
* Added:
** All [[axe]]s to the "Combat" tab (they still remain in the tools & utilities tab as well).
** All possible [[suspicious stew]]s to the food & drinks tab.
*** The tooltip shows the effect of a stew before it's picked up from the creative inventory.
*** Only stews with effects available via crafting or [[mooshroom]]s are listed.
** [[Pressure plate]]s and [[button]]s of each type to the building blocks tab.
** Almost all lighting blocks to the top of the functional blocks tab.
** All 3 flight durations of [[firework]]s to tools & utilities tab, and the combat tab next to [[crossbow]].
** [[Eye of ender]] next to [[end portal frame]] block in functional tab for better ease of use.
* Tooltips for all items in creative menu outside single-category tabs show categories where this item can be found.
** Previously this only happened on the search tab.

'''[[Spectator]]'''
* "Teleport to Team Member" option in spectator menu now only shows up for teams with viable target players.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|publish}}'''
* Now has new arguments to enable commands and set the default game mode.
** New syntax: {{cmd|publish [<allowCommands>] [<gamemode>] [<port>]}}

=== General ===
'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* Made changes to the "Open to LAN" screen.
* Now allows selecting the port on which to host the LAN world.
* The game mode and allow cheats buttons are now initialized with the default values of the world.

'''[[Music]]'''
* The Wild Update music has been tweaked to be slightly less loud.

'''[[Recipes]]'''
* Many recipe files were made to be formatted more consistently.
* Blocks and items that are crafted using nine of a single item are now considered shapeless recipes, though this has no impact on gameplay.

'''[[Resource pack]]'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>12</code>.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* The <code>#overworld_natural_logs</code> item tag was removed.

* Two new log-like blocks.
* Block of bamboo can be crafted from 9 [[bamboo]] and can be stripped like other logs.
* Bamboo planks crafted from block of bamboo yield only 2 planks compared to 4 for logs.

==== General ====
