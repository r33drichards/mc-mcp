=== Composting ===
{{Main|Composter#Composting}}
When a [[composter]] is completely filled, a single bone meal drops the next time the composter is {{ctrl|used}}.

To fill the composter, almost any plant-like item can be used, including [[vines]], [[leaves]], and [[mushroom]]s.

Bone meal can also be used on the following [[plant]]s to have a chance to increase their growth stage:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Plant
!Action
|-
|{{BlockLink|Wheat}}<br>{{BlockLink|Carrots}}<br>{{BlockLink|Potatoes}}
|The plant matures 2–5 growth stages.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Beetroots}}
|The plant has a 75% chance of growing to the next growth stage.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Bamboo}}
|Grows the [[bamboo]] by 1-2 stems.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Melon Stem|link=Melon Seeds}}<br>{{BlockLink|Pumpkin Stem|link=Pumpkin Seeds}}
|The planted stem matures 2–5 growth stages. Bone meal affects only the stem's growth; it does not cause [[melon]]s or [[pumpkin]]s to sprout from a mature stem.

|The [[sapling]] has a 45% chance of growing to the next growth stage, if possible. Saplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into [[tree]]s as the third stage. A tree cannot grow unless the sapling is planted in proper ground and sufficient space is available. Using bone meal on such an obstructed sapling with no chance of growing wastes the bone meal.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Sunflower}}<br>{{BlockLink|Lilac}}<br>{{BlockLink|Rose Bush}}<br>{{BlockLink|Peony}}
|The corresponding item form drops, without destroying the original plant.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Short Grass}}<br>{{BlockLink|Fern}}<br>{{BlockLink|Seagrass}}
|A one-block-high tall [[short grass]], [[fern]], or [[seagrass]] (that is on [[grass block]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]], [[mud]], or [[muddy mangrove roots]]) grows into a two-block-high [[tall grass]], [[large fern]], or [[tall seagrass]].
|-
|{{BlockLink|Mushrooms}}

|The bush matures 1 growth stage.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Sea Pickle}}
|If the [[sea pickle]] is on a [[coral block]] and in [[water]] at least 2 blocks deep, the sea pickle colony grows, and additional sea pickles generate nearby.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Sugar Cane}}{{only|bedrock|short=1}}
|The sugar cane grows to maximum height (three blocks tall).
|-
|{{BlockLink|Kelp}}
|The kelp plant grows by 1 block per bone meal used, up to its maximum height.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Flower|id=poppy}} (excluding [[wither rose]] and [[torchflower]]){{only|bedrock|short=1}}
|One-block-high flowers make more flowers of the same type grow in the surrounding area.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Nether Fungus|id=fungi}}
|Has a 40% chance of growing into [[huge fungi]], but only if on the respective [[nylium]].
|-
|{{BlockLink|Weeping Vines}}

|-
|{{BlockLink|Glow Lichen}}
|The [[glow lichen]] spreads to a random adjacent block.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
|The [[moss block]] causes nearby [[stone]], [[cave vines]], and [[dirt]] to become moss blocks. Additionally, those moss blocks may grow [[azalea]]s, [[flowering azalea]]s, [[short grass]], [[tall grass]], or [[moss carpet]]s.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
|The [[pale moss block]] causes nearby [[stone]], [[cave vines]], and [[dirt]] to become pale moss blocks, and turns into a [[pale moss patch]].
|-
|{{BlockLink|Big Dripleaf}}<br>{{BlockLink|Small Dripleaf}}
|A [[big dripleaf]] grows one block higher, and a [[small dripleaf]] becomes a [[big dripleaf]].
|-
|{{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
|Causes [[hanging roots]] to grow underneath the [[rooted dirt]] if there is space.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Mangrove Leaves}}
|Creates a hanging [[mangrove propagule]] under the [[mangrove leaves]].
|-
|{{BlockLink|Mangrove Propagule}} (hanging)
|The [[mangrove propagule]] matures 1 growth age.
|-
|{{BlockLink|Pink Petals}}

Bone meal does not affect:
* [[Cactus]]
* [[Vines]]
* [[Nether wart]]
* [[Sugar cane]]{{only|JE}}
* [[Chorus plant]]s, or other plants not listed above.

==== Wasting bone meal ====
Bone meal can be used on the following objects in the following situations, consuming it without any real effect:

* On [[short grass]], [[fern]]s, and [[seagrass]] that do not have enough space to grow.{{verify|Is this outdated? According to the bug report, this has been fixed}}<ref>{{bug|MC-125642||Bone meal is consumed when used on fern, grass and seagrass even if it cannot grow|Fixed}}</ref>
* On [[seagrass]] that doesn't have [[water]] above.
* On a [[dark oak sapling]] or a [[pale oak sapling]] that is not in a group of four.<ref>{{bug|MC-168446||Single dark oak and pale oak saplings accept bone meal despite not being able to grow}}</ref>
* On a [[mushroom]] that is not on a block that allows it to grow into a huge mushroom.<ref>{{bug|MC-173213||Red and brown mushrooms accept bone meal even on blocks not in #minecraft:mushroom_grow_block}}</ref>
* On a [[sea pickle]] that is already in a group of four and has no valid locations to expand to.<ref>{{bug|MC-127995}}</ref>
* On a [[sea pickle]] that is not on a [[coral block]].
* On a [[bamboo]] (not [[bamboo shoot]]) that is blocked in the way.<ref>{{bug|MC-254785||Bone meal is used when clicked on a bamboo stalk with a block above it}}</ref>
* On a [[Nether fungus]] that is not on its respective [[nylium]].
* Any [[plant]]s whose growth is blocked by the [[build limit]].

=== Creating new plants ===
{{ctrl|Using}} bone meal on a [[grass block]] causes foliage to sprout on and around the targeted block. Grass blocks within a 15×5×15{{only|java|short=1}} or 7×5×7{{only|bedrock|short=1}} area of the target block randomly chooses which type of foliage to grow, if any (provided there is adequate space for the plant to grow). The types of foliage that can be created in this way are [[short grass]], [[fern]]{{only|be|short=1}}, [[tall grass]]{{only|je|short=1}}, [[flower]]s, and [[pink petals]], with the latter two being dependent on external factors like the biome and coordinates. See {{slink|Flower|Flower biomes}} and {{slink|Flower|Post-generation}} for more information.

Using bone meal on a 2-block flower ([[rose bush]]es, [[sunflower]]s, [[lilac]]s or [[peonies]]) cause one of the same type of flower to drop, without breaking the original. This is the only way to reproduce these flowers, since they cannot generate from using bone meal on grass blocks.

Using bone meal on a [[Placement#Surface_and_block_types|full square solid surface]] that is adjacent to a water source can generates [[seagrass]] on that block and surrounding blocks. {{IN|java}}, [[coral]] and [[coral fan]]s may have a chance to generate in [[warm ocean]] biomes; {{in|bedrock}}, coral and coral fans can be generated in any biome. {{IN|bedrock}}, in order to successfully use bone meal underwater, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water.

Using bone meal on a [[sea pickle]] on a [[coral block]] creates sea pickles. This generates sea pickles up to 3 [[block]]s (of coral) away, so a 7 × 7 square (49 blocks) of coral may be necessary, to return the most sea pickles per given bone meal attempt (more attempts grows them more numerously, exactly - including the range of it growing, like grass with heights on grass blocks - as coral and coral fans, though those others being non-solid blocks).

Using bone meal on [[netherrack]] adjacent to [[nylium]] converts the netherrack into nylium of the same type. If both crimson and warped nylium are adjacent to the netherrack that was applied with bone meal, there is a 50% chance that either type of nylium is created.

Using bone meal on [[nylium]] causes the corresponding [[roots|nether roots]] and both types of [[Nether fungi]] to appear on the nylium block and other nylium, [[netherrack]], [[dirt]] or [[grass block]]s nearby (in a 5 × 5 total area), with the type of fungi matching the type of nylium being more common. In addition, using bone meal on warped nylium creates [[nether sprouts]] and [[twisting vines]].

=== Farmer villagers ===
[[Villager]]s with the farmer profession can collect bone meal from a full [[composter]], with which they can make their [[crop farming|crops]] grow faster.

== Trivia ==
* Bone meal can be used on the sides or bottom of a [[grass block]], as well as on a grass block with [[plant]]s already on top of it.
* Regardless of if it succeeds in fertilizing, bone meal makes green sparkles. However, like smoke from a [[torch]], the sparkles appear only if the [[player]] has [[particles]] set All or Decreased.
* In real life, [[Wikipedia:bone meal|bone meal]] is used as a fertilizer to provide nitrogen and phosphorus to plants.
