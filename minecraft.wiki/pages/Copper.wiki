'''Copper''' is a [[metal]] found in the [[Overworld]] that is used to craft [[copper armor]], [[copper tool]]s, building blocks and other [[item]]s, as well as to create [[copper golem]]s. Most blocks made from copper [[oxidize]] slowly over time, changing their appearance.

Copper [[World generation|generates]] naturally as [[copper ore]], which drops [[raw copper]] that can be smelted into [[Copper ingot|ingots]]. Additionally, [[copper block]]s - many of which are fully oxidized - can be found abundantly in [[trial chambers]].

== Items ==
* {{ItemLink|Raw Copper}} – an item dropped from mining copper ore.
* {{ItemLink|Copper Ingot}} – an [[item]] created by smelting raw copper or by killing [[drowned]] and [[copper golem]]s.
* {{ItemLink|Copper Nugget}} – obtained by smelting copper tools and armor.
* {{ItemLink|Bolt Armor Trim}} – an item that is duplicated using a [[block of copper]].

=== Gear and tools ===
* {{ItemLink|Spyglass}} – an item crafted with copper ingots and an [[amethyst shard]] that can be used to zoom in on distant objects.
* {{ItemLink|Brush}} – a tool crafted with a [[stick]], a  copper ingot and a [[feather]]. It can be used to brush [[suspicious block]]s and can also be used on [[armadillo]]s to obtain [[armadillo scute]]s.
* {{ItemLink|Copper Axe}}
* {{ItemLink|Copper Hoe}}
* {{ItemLink|Copper Pickaxe}}
* {{ItemLink|Copper Shovel}}

== Blocks ==
* {{BlockLink|Copper Torch}}

* {{BlockLink|Copper Ore}} – an ore that can be found underground.
* {{BlockLink|Deepslate Copper Ore}} – the [[deepslate]] variant of copper ore.

=== Oxidizing blocks ===
Blocks made from copper can [[oxidize]] over time, gaining a verdigris appearance over four stages:
* {{BlockSprite|block-of-copper}} Unoxidized
* {{BlockSprite|exposed-copper}} Exposed
* {{BlockSprite|weathered-copper}} Weathered
* {{BlockSprite|oxidized-copper}} Oxidized

They can be prevented from oxidizing by being waxed with [[honeycomb]]s, and returned to previous oxidation stages using an [[axe]]. [[Lightning|Lightning strikes]] also remove oxidation stages. This brings the number of variants for each block listed below up to eight.
