{{Q|“Blind Spots” is the first song I wrote with the clear intention of having a unique soundtrack for Minecraft’s “creative mode”. I tried to create a piece that doesn’t particularly change much, but keeps reiterating on itself, like a constant remixing of its core theme. As the piece ends, it becomes very melancholic and solemn, but quickly returns to being positive. Things end, but that’s not bad.|C418|c418.org}}

== Track description ==
{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Blind spots.ogg]]

"Blind Spots" starts off primarily featuring a major seven chord, and later introduces darker minor chords. The entire track is a piano song dominated by a repeated quarter note rhythm. The piano, which has an echo effect on it, plays a bright melody before it is joined by a synth orchestra, with some quiet synth percussion.

At some points, there are chiptune-style synthesizers playing chords that support the main melody, and at other points, there is a distorted bell or chime sound (possibly a [[wikipedia:Mbira|kalimba]]) that plays [[wikipedia:Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] chords. There is also a synth bass that plays arpeggiated chords throughout.
