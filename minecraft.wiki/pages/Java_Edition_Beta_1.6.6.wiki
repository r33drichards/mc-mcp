=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[File:Oak Boat JE1.png|32px]]  [[Boat]]s'''
* Float up to the surface quicker.
* When falling down into water, they lose vertical momentum much faster.
* Crashing into soul sand on a boat now kills the player, but keeps the boat intact.

== Fixes ==
'''3 bugs fixed'''
* Fixed [[bed]]s not working very well in [[multiplayer]].
* Destroying a [[boat]] no longer spawns the player too low, causing them to sometimes fall through the ground.
* {{key|Shift}}+ clicking a [[tool]] into a chest no longer restores it to new.
