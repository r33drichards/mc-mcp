'''15w42a''' is the thirty-third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on October 14, 2015.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.mojang.com/2015/10/minecraft-snapshot-15w42a/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''{{Animate|Frosted Ice JE1.png; Frosted Ice 1 JE1 BE1.png; Frosted Ice 2 JE1 BE1.png; Frosted Ice 3 JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Frosted ice]]'''
* Created when using "Frost Walker" enchantment.
* Cannot be obtained in inventory, neither with Silk Touch, pick block nor with commands. (Can only be placed using {{cmd|setblock}}, {{cmd|fill}} etc.)
* Despawns after a few seconds.
** Despawning takes place in four breaking stages (blockstates: <code>age:0, age:1, age:2, age:3</code>). Still decays with <code>randomTickSpeed</code> set to 0, but a higher number makes it decay faster.
** Despawns faster with a higher light level (doesn't despawn at night).

=== Command format ===
'''[[NBT format]]'''
* [[Brewing stand]]s
** <code>Fuel</code> (byte): Stores how much fuel is remaining in a brewing stand.
*** e.g. <code>/setblock ~ ~1 ~ minecraft:brewing_stand 0 replace {Fuel:127b}</code>.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* "Treasure" enchantments.
** Can only be obtained from [[chest loot]], [[fishing]], or [[trading]] for enchanted books.
* New treasure enchantment: [[Frost Walker]].
** Turns water into [[frosted ice]].
** Different tiers:
*** Level I creates a circle of frosted ice around the player with a radius of 2 blocks.
*** Each additional level adds 1 to that radius.
** Works while riding mobs.
** Doesn't turn water into frosted ice if an entity is in that spot.
** Works as long as the [[player]] is within one block above a solid block.
** Flowing water also turns into frosted ice, making one bucket of water enough to make an infinite water source.
** Cannot be combined with [[Depth Strider]] enchantment.
* New treasure enchantment: [[Mending]].
** Any experience collected while holding the item repairs it instead of going to the experience bar.
*** Mainhand, offhand, and armor slots all count as held.
*** If multiple held items have the enchantment, one is chosen at random for each XP orb collected.
*** Repairs at a rate of 2 durability per XP.
*** If the amount of repair needed is less than the value of the XP orb, the extra XP goes to the experience bar.
*** [[Shield]]s cannot be enchanted with Mending using {{command|enchant}} or an anvil in Survival.
**** Mending enchantment '''does''' affect the shield when using anvil in Creative or NBT commands.

=== General ===
'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added the following splashes:
** "Falling with style!"
** "There's no stopping the Trollmaso"
** "Throw yourself at the ground and miss"

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Brewing stand]]'''
* Requires [[blaze powder]] to be able to use.
** One piece of blaze powder allows for 30 ingredients to be brewed in the brewing stand (tag: <code>Fuel:30b</code>).
*** To be exact, it removes 1 from fuel (1 blaze powder = 30 fuel) every time the [[player]] puts an ingredient in (if the player takes it out and puts it back in, it takes another fuel).
** Can be automated by putting a hopper feeding in the side of the block like water bottles.

=== Items ===
'''[[Elytra]]'''
* Nerfed - the player is no longer able to go higher than where they started.
* New sneaking animation.
* The player can now fit through one block high gaps while gliding.
* Horizontal collisions now deal damage, new death message: "Player experienced kinetic energy".

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Boat]]s'''
* Now slightly faster than sprinting.
** This makes them similar in speed to the old boats, though with less momentum.
* Players can now {{control|use}} items and {{control|attack}} immediately after they stop rowing.
* All types of boats are now craftable, except for dark oak boats.<ref>{{bug|MC-90590}}</ref>

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Anvil]] repairing'''
* Renaming an item does not increase the repair cost for a future repair/rename any more.

'''[[Enchanting]]'''
* Enchantments with maximum level I no longer display the level, e.g. "Infinity" rather than "Infinity I".
* When multiple pieces of Thorns armor are worn, one is now chosen at random instead of always using the "bottommost" piece.

=== General ===
'''[[Player]]s'''
* When crouching, players are 1.65 blocks tall (versus 1.8 blocks normally).
* When flying with elytra, players are now only 0.6 blocks tall.
* When laying in bed, players are as tall as a 0.2 blocks cube.

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Changed "0% sugar" to "1% sugar".
* Removed "SOPA means LOSER in Swedish!".
