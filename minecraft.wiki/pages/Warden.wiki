A '''warden''' is a completely blind [[hostile mob]], summoned by [[sculk shrieker]]s in the [[deep dark]]. It relies on [[vibrations]] and its sense of smell to detect [[player]]s and [[entities]] to attack, and will despawn if it does not detect anything for long enough. If a warden successfully detects a target, it will rapidly strike them with its arms, or fire damaging sonic beams which pass through [[block]]s and ignore [[armor]].

== Spawning ==
[[File:Warden emerging.gif|thumb|upright|A warden emerges from the ground after being summoned by [[sculk shrieker]]s.]]Wardens do not follow the standard [[mob spawning]] rules. Instead, a warden is spawned when a player in [[Survival]], [[Adventure]] or [[Creative]] mode activates any number of naturally generated [[sculk shrieker]]s four times (see details below).

Each player has a ''warning level'', which increases every time that player activates a naturally generated sculk shrieker. This is not specific to any sculk shrieker. A sculk shrieker that has already been activated by a player before activates the same way it does normally, and the warning level does not reset if the player were to activate a new sculk shrieker. The distance between the shriekers doesn't matter. The shrieker spawns a warden 4.5 seconds after the warning level reaches 4, or immediately if the sculk shrieker is destroyed. If the warning level is already at 4, it stays at 4 and spawns another warden.

The [[light level]] does not have an effect on shrieker activation or warden spawning, regardless of the warning level.

When a shrieker attempts to spawn a warden, it makes up to 20 attempts to spawn the warden within an 11×13×11 cubic area centered on the shrieker. During each attempt, the game picks a random column (i.e. a stack of blocks parallel to the Y axis), and then picks the highest valid block in that column. A valid block is any block that has a complete top surface (i.e. the top face is a grid-aligned square meter surface with no holes), and that a warden can be placed directly on top of without having the warden collide with any existing blocks or entities. A warden can't spawn if the bottom block that it would occupy has a [[liquid]] inside it, but it can spawn with 1 or more liquids in the blocks above that. So, a [[pressure plate]] with [[water]] flowing on top would be a valid location for the shrieker to spawn the warden (this would place the warden with its feet in the water, one block above the pressure plate).

{{IN|java}}, warden spawning can be toggled on or off with the [[game rule]] {{cd|doWardenSpawning}}.

== Behavior ==
[[File:Warden sniffing.gif|thumb|upright|A warden is blind and seeks out targets by sensing vibrations and by sniffing.]]
After spawning, wardens wander randomly and move toward nearby vibrations originating from players, mobs, and non-mob sources including projectiles and [[minecart]]s. A warden also periodically sniffs the area around it, allowing it to zero in on targets even if they don't create vibrations. As wardens sniff, pick up vibrations, or are touched by other players or mobs, they become increasingly agitated.

Similar to sculk, the bright blue parts of the warden's texture are emissive with [[Vibrant Visuals]], easily noticable in the dark where they spawn.

=== Idle ===
A warden can fit inside any space that is 1 block wide and 3 blocks tall, allowing it to chase players and mobs through small corridors.

Wardens are immune to damage from [[fire]] or [[lava]], and are immune to [[Damage#Knockback|knockback]]. They pursue through blocks that are usually avoided by other mobs, including [[rail]]s<ref name="MC-249642">{{bug|MC-249642||Wardens can't pass over rails|Fixed}}</ref>, [[cacti]], or [[magma block]]s.

A warden listens to all vibrations within a 15 block radius ovoid shape, except those from other wardens, [[armor stand]]s, dying mobs, and players in [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] mode. Like with [[sculk sensor]]s, they cannot detect vibrations from a [[sneaking]] player that is moving, [[jumping]], falling or shooting a projectile. A warden has a 2-second cooldown between detecting vibrations.

A warden is aware of all targetable entities within a 49×51×49 box around itself. If the warden has a targetable entity, is not investigating any disturbances, and is otherwise idle, it pathfinds toward the closest entity, prioritizing players over mobs. While pathfinding, the warden can begin a 'sniff' behavior and animation. This takes around 4.2 seconds and has a 5-10 seconds cooldown. A warden can still sniff out sneaking players, despite not being able to detect vibrations from them.

A warden prefers to track down the most suspicious targets, rather than the ones closest to it.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1464376942791213059|Also currently it sniffs out the mob/player that it is most suspicious of, rather than the nearest mob/player.|November 26, 2021}}</ref>

=== Inflicting Darkness ===
A warden, whether angered or not, gives 13 seconds of [[Darkness]] to all players within a 20 block ovoid radius of it every 6 seconds. The souls in its chest make a low heartbeat that occurs in tandem with the Darkness effect.{{info needed|Does this heartbeat effect require the player to have Darkness? Does it play in Creative mode?}} The heartbeat speeds up as the warden becomes increasingly agitated.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1449816849655472128|Currently the Warden's heartbeat gets faster the angrier or "close" it is to find its prey. In real time, this has really felt like it mimics the panic level of the player itself &mdash; the closer the Warden is to finding you, the more anxious you're probably going to be.|October 17, 2021}}</ref>

=== Suspense ===
Wardens keep track of how angry they are at each suspect as a number from 0 to 150. When a warden notices a vibration, it adds anger to the player or mob that caused the vibration. It adds 10 anger if the vibration was from a projectile or 35 anger for other vibrations. However, if two projectiles from the same player/mob are heard by the warden within five seconds, it instead adds the full 35 anger toward that player/mob. Wardens do not add anger toward a mob/player if the projectile was shot from more than 30 blocks away, although the projectile does count toward the counter of two projectiles. Anger decays at a rate of 1 per second and immediately clears if the targeted player switches to [[Creative]] or [[Spectator]] modes, the target or warden leaves the dimension, or if the target dies.

A warden adds 35 anger toward any mob that directly touches it. This effect has a 1-second cooldown.

When it finishes sniffing, a warden adds 35 anger to the nearest mob or player within a 6 block radius horizontally and 20 blocks vertically, a cylindrical volume centered on the warden.
[[File:Warden roar.gif|thumb|upright|A warden roars before pursuing its target.]]
Once a warden reaches 80 anger with a target, it roars for 4.2 seconds, adds another 20 anger, and pursues the target. In this angered state, the warden chases the target normally despite being blind. A warden also enters its hostile state and adds 100 anger if directly attacked by a mob. If the attacking player or mob is within 5 blocks, it skips its roaring animation altogether and immediately gives chase.

A warden is biased toward player vibrations, attacks, and contact - even if a warden is angrier at another mob, it still attacks the player first as long as they have angered the warden as well. This is not true of any other [[mob]].<ref>{{bug|MC-251045|||WAI}}</ref>

After 60 seconds of being "calm" and not detecting any vibrations or sniffing any mobs, as well as immediately after being spawned by a command block with status effects, a warden burrows back into the ground and despawns. If the warden is floating on a liquid, it instead immediately despawns without any burrowing animation. During its emerging/burrowing animation, a warden cannot detect any vibrations and can take damage only from {{cmd|kill}}, though it can still be pushed by entities, [[piston]]s, or liquids. [[Name Tag|Named]] wardens do not despawn.

Unlike most hostile mobs, wardens do not despawn randomly when more than 32 blocks from a player, nor do they immediately despawn when more than 128 blocks from a player.

=== Attacks ===
A warden's melee attack has a cooldown of 36 ticks (1.8 seconds) and disables [[shield]]s for 5 seconds, dealing {{hp|16}} to {{hp|45}} health points depending on the difficulty.
[[File:Warden sonic boom.jpg|thumb|left|The warden's sonic boom attack on a [[chicken]]]]
If a warden cannot reach its target, it switches to its ranged attack: a sonic boom. It does so when the following are true:
*It has been 10 seconds since the warden detected the target
*It has been 5 seconds since the warden last used a melee or ranged attack
*The target is within a 14 block radius horizontally and 20 blocks vertically of the warden in an ovoid shape.

The sonic boom aims directly at the '''only''' target, making it impossible to dodge, passing through all blocks and entities. A warden takes 1.7 seconds to charge and unleashes the attack, which instantly hits the target as long as the target is within attack range. The attack takes an additional 1.3 seconds to cool down before the warden can use melee attacks again for a total of 3 seconds. The sonic boom is visible via green-blue [[particles]] that are projected out of the warden's chest. This attack bypasses all forms of [[armor]], including: [[shield]]s, armor [[enchantment]]s (such as [[Protection]]), the shell of a closed [[shulker]] (the shell on the living [[mob]], not the [[shulker shell]] item), the wind armor of a [[breeze]], and the natural armor of a [[wither]].{{Verify|type=current|Does this only apply to the wither, or does it include all natural armor points?}} [[Wolf armor]] loses durability when hit by a sonic boom, but normal armor does not. Only the 85%{{only|je}} or 95%{{only|be}} magic damage resistance of a [[witch]] and the [[Resistance]] effect can reduce the damage from a sonic boom.

For the [[Nether Update]], Mojang planned to add a "blind [[piglin]] that could only respond to sounds" that could be found within a "new biome".<ref name="meet-warden">{{mcnet|meet-warden|Meet the Warden|June 3, 2022|Per Landin}}</ref> This idea was then later reused for the warden instead.

The warden was developed by [[Brandon Pearce]]. During early development, the planned mechanics and abilities of the warden were significantly different to the final version. Planned and then scrapped ideas for the warden include:
* If the player managed to get out of the warden's attack and pathfinding range but still be within its detection range, the warden would use a "mind-altering" attack that would cause the player to move erratically (walking forward would cause the player to go backward, etc.) and deal damage overtime. The mechanic was eventually scrapped due to being deemed too complicated.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1320772725066076165|I think something a little more.. mind altering.|October 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name="cheesingthewarden">{{ytl|uraHCIYRjsM|Podcast: Warden Iterations with kingbdogz|Minecraft Ideas Academy @ 1:15:31|November 22, 2022|t=4531s}}</ref>
* The warden would destroy blocks or burrow through them. The former was rejected due to the developers wanting to limit the number of "destructive" mobs there are in the game and the latter was rejected due to being too difficult to implement.<ref name="cheesingthewarden"/>
* The warden could hide the player's hunger bar and health bar.<ref>{{Tweet|CagilMartin|1554743654182715392|Fun fact: One warden prototype hid your hunger and health bar. That would have been scary Source: Minecraft Ideas Academy|August 3, 2022}}</ref>
* Brandon wanted the warden to be immune to damage to discourage players from fighting it, but he didn't think that would work for a sandbox game.<ref>{{Tweet|CagilMartin|1556533751571947520|Fun fact: Kingbdogz originally wanted the warden to be invincible to discourage combat but he scrapped that idea.

* The warden originally burned when exposed to daylight.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1395834612191006726|1. It will not.

Probably the most concepted and worked through entity(s) in Minecraft, in sound design.

=== Early concepts and prototypes ===
There were multiple prototypes for what ultimately became the warden.<ref name=wardeninfo>{{ytl|cd7cVNeb0Uk|The Secrets of Minecraft: How We're Making the Warden|Minecraft|January 21, 2022}}</ref> According to [[Jasper Boerstra]], it went through 175 different concept iterations to ensure that the warden was "something really special".<ref>{{Ytl|pI6HFSu2W8Y|Minecraft Now: The Warden and Mangroves|Minecraft|June 30, 2022|t=657}}</ref> The very first warden iteration created was a modified cow that made the lights and torches flicker and served as the main prototype for the darkness effect.<ref>{{ytl|PiGKxxvCkUw|The Scariest Cow Ever Created The Story Of The Warden|Minecraft @ 4:36|Mar 30, 2024|t=276}}</ref>

Some known concepts and names for the warden from this time were the "shade",<ref>{{ytl|n9TpuPGH9hk|Minecraft Now: Wild Update and Farlands ft AntVenom!|Minecraft|May 19, 2022|t=1285s}}</ref> the "stalker" and the "hollowed".<ref name=wardeninfo />

==== Shade ====
The '''shade''' was a vaguely humanoid translucent mob with glowing eyes. It was meant to be a more ambient mob, which would stand in darkness with only its eyes visible and would slowly fade away as the player approached it. It would also imitate the noise of other mobs, making it sound as though they were right behind the player.

Rather than an iteration on the warden, by then called the "stalker", the shade had come to be a completely separate mob to the stalker, though in some concepts it was meant to be sort of complementary, living in the [[ancient cities]] and helping the stalker by tricking players into alerting it. It was eventually scrapped due to a feeling that it would grow to become annoying rather than creepy, and so the team could better focus on developing the stalker.<ref>{{ytl|uraHCIYRjsM|Podcast: Warden Iterations with kingbdogz|Minecraft Ideas Academy|November 22, 2022|t=2860s}}</ref>

It is unknown whether the shade was ever implemented into the game as a prototype.

<gallery>
Warden concept art 6.png|Concept art of the early "shade" prototype.

==== Stalker ====
Another early prototype was the '''stalker'''. Several pieces of concept art were created for this iteration of the mob, and a prototype of the original stalker design was programmed into the game.

The first stalker iteration was a mob that could spawn anywhere deep underground. Stalkers could make torches flicker off and on when nearby.<ref>{{ytl|PiGKxxvCkUw|The Scariest Cow Ever Created The Story Of The Warden|Minecraft @ 1:32|Mar 30, 2024|t=92}}</ref> The stalker was tall and asymmetrical with a glowing core, sometimes referred to as a chest crystal.<ref name="meet-warden"/> It occurred in totems throughout the deep dark. The stalker would stand completely still to trick players into taking its core and aggravating it.

A later version of the stalker could transform into a form that was less wide and tall when chasing an entity or player, while its regular form was meant to disguise as a treasure totem. This iteration got scrapped as it was considered too clunky and goofy, and was insufficiently scary.

The vibration-sensing aspect, which was developed in this version, however, was passed down to and refined in the later iterations.<ref>{{tweet|kingbdogz|1484953764205318147|Some ideas we had for early iterations of the Warden. Stalkers were going to have a glowing item in the middle of its chest that you would also randomly find throughout the biome floating on totems.

</gallery>

==== Hollowed ====
Later on, the stalker was renamed to hollowed. Several pieces of concept art were also created for the hollowed design iteration. A prototype of the hollowed design was programmed into the game.

The hollowed was designed with the intent of inciting [[Wikipedia:Trypophobia|trypophobia]] and had white flesh with holes in it. According to [[Brandon Pearce]], its design was an experiment to see how far the boundaries of ''Minecraft '' could be pushed and to try and draw a line as to what would be acceptable. The design had to ultimately be toned down multiple times due to said metaphorical line being crossed. The visuals for this iteration were ultimately scrapped, as they were considered too uncanny and overall frightening for ''Minecraft''. After many back-and-forths between the developers, the directors and art team, a design similar to the current one was landed on, with the mechanics remaining mostly the same.<ref>{{ytl|9leQqqlWwU0|146 - From Modding to Mojang with Kingbdogz // The Spawn Chunks: A Minecraft Podcast|The Spawn Chunks @ 2:55|June 21, 2021|t=5264}}</ref><ref>{{ytl|uraHCIYRjsM|Podcast: Warden Iterations with kingbdogz|Minecraft Ideas Academy @ 1:07:47|November 22, 2022|t=4067s}}</ref>

The sounds created for the hollowed were even more unsettling and scarier than what had been created for the current warden iteration.<ref>{{ytl|PiGKxxvCkUw|The Scariest Cow Ever Created The Story Of The Warden|Minecraft @ 2:48|Mar 30, 2024|t=171}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* The warden is the most iterated mob in terms of designs with it having 175 iterations.<ref>{{Ytl|pI6HFSu2W8Y|Minecraft Now: The Warden and Mangroves|Minecraft|June 30, 2022|t=657}}</ref> The second being the [[Bee#Concept Artwork|bee]] with it having 13 iterations as seen in [[The World of Minecraft]] book. 
* Although the warden is supposed to be blind, [[Spectator#Mob view|spectating]] it reveals that it still has normal vision.<ref>{{bug|MC-249500|||WAI}}</ref>
* [[Brandon Pearce]] considers the warden as something entirely new, as it isn't a boss, a mini boss or a regular enemy, but a force of nature: "when a tornado is barreling towards you, you don't try to kill it - you run away! The warden is exactly the same."<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1312579202076626944|I'd actually consider it something entirely new. The Warden is a force of a nature, not a boss. When a tornado is barreling towards you, you don't try to kill it - you run away! The Warden is exactly the same.|October 4, 2020}}</ref>
* Brandon's thought process on finally giving the warden a drop after he was heavily against it was the warden should never drop something that is important or hard to get that would be worth going through the trouble of fighting it. In this case, fighting a warden is not worth a [[sculk catalyst]]. This change was made for renewability farms and tech players.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1519355948518854656|The key is that the Warden should never drop something that is important or hard to get that would be worth going through the trouble of fighting it. In this case though, fighting a Warden is not worth a Sculk Catalyst. This change is only made for renewability farms/tech players|April 28, 2022}}</ref>
* The warden and sculk were inspired by {{w|Lovecraftian horror}}, as the developers wanted to make something that wasn't traditionally scary (like jumpscares), but scary in a "mysterious and unknown" way.<ref>{{ytl|rpKieiahBBU|Minecraft 1.19: The Deep Dark – Not So Scary After All! (If You’re The Warden)|Minecraft|August 12, 2022}}</ref>
* In the sixth episode of ''[[The Secrets of Minecraft]]'', it was joked that the warden's personal names are "Jonathan" and "William", depending on the scene, similar to how the [[player]], the [[ender dragon]] or the [[wither]] all have personal joke names.<ref name="wardeninfo" /> "Warden" itself was also jokingly broken down into "War! Dens!" in the description.
** "Jonathan" can be seen on a blackboard for name suggestions alongside "the stalker" and "the hollowed".
** It is also joked that the name "warden" was the result of calling it "William" and spelling it wrong.
** In the tenth episode, both names were used when [[Narrator (YouTube)|Narrator]] spotted the warden behind him.<ref>{{Ytl|Z4haZTbU9ZA|The Secrets of Minecraft's Deep Dark|Minecraft|June 24, 2022|t=310s}}</ref> He mistakenly called the warden Jonathan before correcting himself as William, foreshadowing [[Jonathan Minecraft]], who appears in the eleventh and final episode leading into ''[[Around the Minecraft World in 80 Biomes]]''.<ref>{{Ytl|CSdQ61dEizI|The FINAL Secrets of Minecraft!!|Minecraft|July 22, 2022|t=15s}}</ref>
* [[Brandon Pearce]] stated in a tweet that the souls in the warden's chest is important to its lore.<ref>{{Tweet|kingbdogz|1484988496876126210|In terms of character, the souls in its chest were incredibly important to its lore and, likewise with the color palette. It all comes together to tell a story that I think can be really more unsettling than any of these previous iterations, despite it being less "gory".|January 23, 2022}}</ref> 
** He also said that the warden is inspired by the mystery heard at the end of the [[Music Disc 11]].<ref>{{ytl|pH_6-ZVOUAk|Ask Mojang #11: All About Caves & Cliffs|Minecraft|OCtober 30, 2020}}</ref>
