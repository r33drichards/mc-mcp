The '''End platform''' is a 5×1×5 square of [[obsidian]] that generates when an [[entity]] enters [[the End]] through an [[End Portal (block)|End portal block]].

== Generation ==
[[File:Obsidian portal blocks broken item forms.png|thumb|Blocks are broken as if mined by the player when the End platform is regenerated.]]

The End platform always generates at [[coordinates]] (100, 48, 0), mostly far away from the island, which may make it difficult to get there. [[Player]]s who enter the End spawn at coordinates (100, 49, 0), facing west toward the main island; other entities that enter the End spawn at coordinates (100.5, 50, 0.5), in the middle of and 1 block higher than the platform. Whenever a new entity enters the End, the platform is regenerated, and all blocks within 3 blocks above the platform are destroyed and dropped as items.{{verify|edition=bedrock}} Sometimes the platform generates inside a case of [[End stone]]; enough End stone is broken in this case so that the player can walk around, with 3 blocks high of breathing space. Occasionally the platform may generate in midair, forcing the player to bridge or throw an [[ender pearl]] toward the main island.

{{IN|java}}, The End platform generates as part of the world generation, but {{in|bedrock}}, it generates only when an entity uses an [[End Portal (block)|End portal block]], not when teleporting with {{cmd|execute in minecraft:the_end}}. [[End gateway]]s on the outer End islands also teleport entities to the platform, but do not cause the platform to regenerate.
