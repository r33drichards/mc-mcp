{{relevant guide|Java Edition guides/Beta 1.0 releases}}<onlyinclude>
'''Beta 1.0''' is the first version of [[Java Edition Beta]], released on December 20, 2010,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mnlhAxap7E</ref><ref>{{twon|2389820531|Minecraft Beta|December 20, 2010}}</ref> which adds a working server-side inventory and includes other changes and fixes.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Skin]]s'''
* Added support for [[cape]]s.
** Initially known as cloaks.
** Only the Mojang cape existed at the time, but any capes are supported, as capes are loaded from minecraft.net in the same way as skins. This can be seen today if a player owns a cape, and an unofficial proxy is used to redirect skin requests to the modern server.
* Added support for [[Easter_eggs#deadmau5's ears|deadmau5's ears]]

'''[[Splash]]'''
* Added new splashes:
** Finally Beta!
** Woo, reddit!
** Twittered about!
** Jump up, jump up, and get down!
** Joel is neat!
** A riddle, wrapped in a mystery!
** Huge tracts of land!
** Welcome to your Doom!
** Stay a while, stay forever!
** Stay a while and listen!
** Treatment for your rash!
** "Noun" is an autonym!
** Information wants to be free!
** "Almost never" is an interesting concept!

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Chest (S) JE1.png|32px]][[File:Large Chest JE1.png|52px]] [[Chest]]s'''
* Moving too far away from a chest, or having it blow up, closes the inventory screen.

'''[[File:Oak Leaves JE3 BE4.png|32px]] [[Leaves]]'''
* Introduced leaf decay again. It acts differently from before.

=== Items ===
'''[[File:Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Egg]]s'''
* Now stack to 16 instead of 64.
* Can now be thrown.
** Throwing an egg has a {{Frac|1|8}} (12.5%) chance of spawning a chicken.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Inventory]]'''
* Working server-side inventory.
* Items now show their names while hovering the mouse over them.
* Removed armor outlines in the armor slots in the inventory.
* The player can't store items in the inventories' crafting fields anymore.
** If this is attempted in this version, the items simply drop to the ground.

=== General ===
'''[[Multiplayer]]'''
* Made servers save chunks way less often in most cases.
** Chunks don't resave if they got saved in the last 30 seconds.

'''[[Splash]]'''
* The splash "Play Minecraft, Watch Topgear, Get Pig" was changed to "Play Minecraft, Watch Topgear, Get Pig!".
** Excluding "Merry X-Mas!" and "Happy New Year!", "Finally Beta!" is the only splash shown.

'''[[Controls]]'''
* The appearance of the buttons of the key settings has been changed.

== Fixes ==
'''3 bugs fixed'''
* Many issues fixed as a result of a working server-side inventory.
* Fixed {{cmd|/kill}}.
* Tools thrown on the ground do not repair themselves anymore.</onlyinclude>
