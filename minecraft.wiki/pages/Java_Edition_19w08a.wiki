=== Command format ===
* <code>'text'</code> can once again be used for string quotes in commands in addition to the double quote <code>"text"</code>.<ref>{{Link|url=https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier/pull/52|title=Allow single quote in strings by boq · Pull Request #52 |website=Mojang/brigadier – GitHub}}</ref>
** Inside single-quoted strings, double quotes are handled as a normal character and requires no escaping (and vice-versa), making it easier to input text components in NBT.
