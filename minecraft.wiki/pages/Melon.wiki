A '''melon''' is a fruit block that grows from a fully-grown melon stem, which in turn is grown from [[melon seeds]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
{{See also|Fortune#Discrete random}}
A melon drops 3–7 [[melon slice]]s when broken by hand, using tools, or pushing with a [[piston]]. [[Silk Touch]] causes the block itself to drop. [[Fortune]] increases the maximum number of melon slices dropped, increasing the average yield to 6.4314 with Fortune III. The actual amount is capped at 9, so Fortune III simply increases the chance of getting 9 slices, which is sufficient to craft the melon again from the slices.

=== Natural generation ===
Melons are naturally generated in [[jungle]] biomes, as a [[pile]] (and in some farms) in savanna [[village]]s and inside tillage rooms of [[woodland mansion]]s.

=== Mob loot ===
An [[enderman]] holding a melon drops the block upon death.

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting

|A3= Melon Slice |B3= Melon Slice |C3= Melon Slice
|Output= Melon
|type= Building block
}}

== Usage ==
=== Farming ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Pumpkin and Melon farming}}

[[Melon seeds]] can be planted, placing a small stem that grows over time. Once the stem reaches maturity, it attempts to generate a melon block in one of the four immediately adjacent blocks; however, this attempt may fail if the chosen adjacent block is not empty or the block beneath is not an appropriate block ([[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[grass block]], [[farmland]], [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[moss block]], [[pale moss block]], [[mud]] or [[muddy mangrove roots]]). Melons take 10 to 30 minutes to grow, which is equal to 0.5 to 1.5 times the length of a [[daylight cycle]]. Once a stem has produced a melon, that stem does not produce any further melons until the existing melon is harvested. Melon stems connect only to the melons they produce. For example, if stem A generates a melon adjacent to stem B, stem B does not connect and can still produce another melon. Similarly, if a melon is placed adjacent to stem B, stem B would still be able to produce another melon. The same principle applies for [[pumpkin]]s. Melons require a light level of 9 or higher to grow.

=== Trading ===
{{Trade uses}}

=== Composting ===
Placing a melon into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1, but it is more efficient to compost melon slices.  Composted melon blocks produce about 7 times less [[bone meal]] than the melon slices needed to craft them, and about 4 times less than the melon slices that could be obtained by breaking them.

* Unlike other versions, the [[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]] is the only version that has a reversible crafting recipe for the melon.
*Minecraft melons greatly resemble square watermelons in real life.
