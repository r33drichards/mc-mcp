'''Minecraft Live 2021: Announcement Trailer''' is the announcement trailer for [[Minecraft Live 2021]].
== Summary ==
The trailer begins with a booming announcer with a 1980s-adjacent vocal filter, describing [[Minecraft Live]] as "pushing the boundaries of what was thought to be possible." Showing a film of [[Alex]] riding a [[horse]], they showcase the progress of the medium, starting with color, then sound, then "3D and cinemascope." Finally, they promise to show Minecraft Live in "the most exciting cinema technique in broadcast history," titling it "Quadramorphic Endervision" in front of a large audience of [[zombies]] and [[husks]], one of which reaching out to the viewer.

The announcer continues, promising "four times more color" with a flock of several [[parrots]]. "Four times the entertainment," represented when the parrots begin dancing on [[jukeboxes]]. "Four times more unpredictable," when a [[piglin]] is caught dancing, to its own embarrassment. After giving the date of the event, the announcer reveals "what our experts have been working on," a massive stereo contraption called the "[[Pillager]] [[Raid]]-eo Sound." A [[chicken]] steps on a [[pressure plate]], which activates the machine, making it play a screeching [[horn]]. After the chicken is sent flying by the sheer volume of the horn, the announcer promises the yearly [[Mob Vote]], before promising the show will be broadcasted live through our state of the art broadcasting system, [[beacon|BEACON]]."
