'''Buzzy Bees''' is the official trailer for the [[Buzzy Bees]] update, showing a day in the life of three bees.

== Summary ==
The video opens on a shot of three [[bee]]s resting inside of a [[bee nest]], waking up after being asleep for the night. They fly out to begin pollinating several [[flower]]s, and we get a first person perspective of one of the bees. It flies over a colony of [[rabbit]]s, then flies down a colossal waterfall. Two bees eye a [[poppy]], and playfully race to pollinate it first before the opposing bee knocks into the protagonist one. The bee falls onto the ground, shakes itself, dusts itself off, and then pollinates the flower anyway.

The video climaxes at a diagonal shot of several bees rushing to help out a [[Village|farm]], pollinating dozens if not hundreds of crops. The bees pass by an [[iron golem]] giving a poppy to [[Villager|children]], fly over a store selling [[honeycomb]]s, fly under a villager drinking a [[Honey Bottle|bottle of honey]], sidestep many more mobs, before knocking into a [[pillager]]. The collision catches the illager off guard, causing them to fire their [[crossbow]] at a [[witch]], exposing them for trying to steal honey. Several angry bees emerge from the [[beehive]] to confront the illagers, and they run away horrified into the wheat fields. A job well done, the bees all return to their homes and fall asleep again.

* The three bees featured in the video make a cameo in [[15 Year Journey]], appropriately in the area named Buzzy Bees.
* At 1:16, the eyes of the [[Rabbit|rabbits]] seen at the start of the video turned glowing red like the [[The Killer Bunny]] easter egg in the game.
