During his time at school, [[Evan]] frequently got harassed by an unnamed '''bully'''.

== Appearance ==
The bully is a noticeably bulky Caucasian teenager, either muscular or overweight. He has slightly brownish blonde hair, with detailed eyebrows and a sharp nose. When introduced, his clothes are gray, with rolled up sleeves and tattered jeans, both of a neutral gray color. A later scene depicts him in a blue jacket, then a magenta t-shirt, a gym uniform consisting of a white shirt and gray shorts, and then a denim jacket over a black hoodie.

== Personality ==
True to his moniker, the bully is a delinquent who enjoys harassment of people he deems beneath him. From his introduction, he is shown to berate victims with childish insults he presumably doesn't believe in, visibly enjoying his mockery of a child. Evan is his only known victim, and frequently harassed both verbally and physically, to the point he tries to destroy his belongings on more than one occasion. However, the bully is not particularly intelligent or wise, and can be defeated. When asked "why don't ''you'' make a friend for a change," he says nothing, and visibly blushes.

== Biography ==
At an unknown time, the bully set his sights on Evan, finding him pathetic and fun to mess with. Prior to the series, he had met (or at least been made aware of) [[Tyler]].

On a Monday, he eyed Evan texting his [[The Gang|friends]] on a smartphone, and began teasing him. He accused him of driving Tyler away from school repeatedly, loving how much he got under his skin. Before things could escalate, the bully decided to leave him be, but not without mocking him once again. However, he would later continue to mock Evan, taping a piece of paper to his locker, labeled "loser." These incidents would continue throughout the week. On Tuesday, he knocked over his books, while on Wednesday he physically assaulted him, and threw his clothes into a gym shower on Thursday.

On Friday, he would go as far as to take Evan's smartphone, holding it over his head. Although he relents, he leaves with another tease to get under his skin, calling his friends imaginary. All these experiences really got to Evan, weighing him down even when playing on the [[Ever Realm]]. After investigating a kidnapping on the server, Evan learned a valuable lesson, and confronted the bully the next day. This time, he had his friends to back him up, with [[Grace]] confronting the bully herself. The group end up winning the conversation, and walk off to class in a positive mood.
