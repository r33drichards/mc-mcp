A '''sticky piston''' is a variant of the [[piston]] that can additionally pull most blocks when it retracts.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A sticky piston can be broken using any [[tool]] with equal efficiency, and always drops itself.
{{IN|java}}, it is faster to break them with a [[pickaxe]]. The pickaxe is also the preferred tool for breaking the head when extended.<ref>{{bug|MC-171370|||WAI}}</ref>
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Sticky Piston|Pickaxe}}

=== Natural generation ===
Three sticky pistons generate as part of each [[jungle pyramid]]. Five sticky pistons also generate in each [[ancient city]].

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|B1 = Slimeball
|B2 = Piston
|Output = Sticky Piston
|type = Redstone
}}

== Usage ==
{{see also|Piston}}
A sticky piston behaves the same way as a [[Piston|normal piston]], except when pulling. A sticky piston pulls when it is [[Redstone circuits|unpowered]].

{{IN|be}}, the start delay is fixed at 1 [[redstone tick]] which is {{convert|2|game tick|second}}, meaning that the sticky piston starts to extend or retract 1 redstone tick (2 game ticks) after it is activated. Sticky pistons can only activate on the input/consumer redstone tick ([[C-tick]]).

==== Soft Inversion ====
{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|be}}, a unique mechanic known as "soft inversion" occurs when a sticky piston is "soft-powered" by redstone. A [[redstone torch]] attached to such a [[soft-powered]] sticky piston will be deactivated, deviating from the normal rule that requires a block to be "[[hard-powered]]" to deactivate an attached torch. This piston-specific behavior allows for circuit designs where the torch is turned off by a dust line running into the side of the sticky piston's block, a feature exclusive to this edition.

=== Pulling ===
A sticky piston also pulls the block attached to its head and any blocks attached to the head via [[Slime Block|slime]]- or [[Honey Block|honey blocks]], but not any of the other blocks it may have pushed.

A sticky piston cannot pull a [[Falling Block|falling block]].

==== Block dropping ====
{{exclusive|java|section=1}}
Sticky pistons finish extending early and start retracting if they lose power before the extension process is over; most 2[[Tick#Game tick | game tick]] long pulses, some 3 game tick long pulses (when [[Piston#Start delay|start delay]] is present) and all pulses equal to or shorter than 1 game tick that pistons can react to allow this to happen. This causes a sticky piston to "drop" the blocks it's pushing, leaving them behind when it starts to retract. Also, the first out of the blocks that are being moved ends up in its final position as soon as the piston starts retracting. This behavior is referred to as "block dropping"<ref> Jeb has once said that the observer block's pulse "Allows tricking sticky pistons into dropping blocks" - https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/5c752g</ref> or sometimes "block spitting".

A sticky piston still pulls a block back if the piston extended through an air gap to contact the block.

== Limitations ==
Sticky pistons have the same [[piston#Limitations|limitations for pushing]] as normal pistons. These limitations also apply for pulling: when a sticky piston is unpowered but cannot pull a block, it retracts without doing so.

The table below lists which blocks can be pushed or pulled.

{{:Sticky_Piston/Table}}

== Technical components ==
{{main|Piston/Technical components}}
Sticky pistons have 2 technical blocks that cannot be obtained. These include the '''piston head''' and '''moving piston''' blocks.

{{exclusive|bedrock|section=1}}
{{IN|be}}, a sticky piston has a [[block entity]] associated with it that holds additional data about the block.

== Trivia ==
* Mojang stated that the 12-block push limit for sticky pistons would not be changed, because "the current limitations are by design".<ref>
{{cite

</ref>
* When toggled between on and off rapidly with a gravity affected block (such as sand) above it, a sticky piston can eventually break the block, which can be picked up as a resource. However, gravel broken this way never drops flint.
* If a sticky piston powered by a short pulse directly pushes a waterlogged block, the block remains waterlogged at its new position.
* Carpet can be placed on the sticky piston extension block, and remains even if it is replaced with a solid block using {{cmd|setblock}}.
