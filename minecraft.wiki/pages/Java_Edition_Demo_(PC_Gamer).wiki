'''Minecraft Demo (PC Gamer)''', commonly referred to as the '''PC Gamer Demo''', is a [[wikipedia:Game demo|demo]] version of [[Java Edition Beta 1.3_01]], that was bundled with issue 214 of the American edition of ''[[wikipedia:PC Gamer|PC Gamer]]'' magazine. It provides 100 minutes (equal to five [[Daylight cycle|days]] in-game) of gameplay, after which the player is required to buy the game in order to continue playing on the current world.

== Features ==
The demo gives access to all the features found in the full version of the game, except that the [[player]] can access one world called the demo world. The demo world, which uses the [[World seed|seed]] <code>glacier</code> (or <code>108181935</code> when hashed), has been altered slightly to help guide newcomers to ''Minecraft''. The demo [[World Spawn|spawn]]s the player at x = 166, y = 65, and z = -57. 

The demo adds the following to the world:
{{columns-list|
* 54 red [[wool]]
* 90 [[snow block]]s
* 122 black wool
* 3 [[chest]]s
* a [[sign]]
* 22 [[gunpowder]]
* a nearly broken iron [[pickaxe]]
* a nearly broken iron [[axe]]
* a nearly broken [[flint and steel]]
* 4 [[coal]]
* 5 [[bread]]
* 4 [[string]]
* 12 [[torch]]es
* 2 [[stick]]s
* 3 [[compass]]es
}}

While the player cannot interact with most blocks, items, or mobs after the demo expires, they can still interact with existing [[boat]]s, and can milk cows if they have a [[bucket]].

The player's save game is saved in the standard game directory and is fully compatible with the full version, making it playable after purchase.

The demo contains an exclusive [[cow]] skin branded with the ''PC Gamer'' logo.

== Changes ==
=== General ===
'''[[Control]]s'''
* Backported the default [[inventory]] hotkey change from [[Java Edition Beta 1.4|Beta 1.4]]. It is now {{key|E}}.
*{{key|Shift}} + {{key|F2}} no longer creates a 36450×17700 pixel screenshot.
* Pressing {{key|F3}} no longer shows the [[debug screen]].

'''[[Splash]]es'''
* Added "PC Gamer Demo!".
* Removed all other splashes.

== Fixes ==
'''2 bugs fixed'''
* [[Pumpkin]] and [[Jack o'Lantern]] [[inventory]] texture now correctly faces forward.
* Pumpkins are no longer worn backward on the [[player]].

== Bugs ==
* If the player's game window is at its smallest size at time of playing, upon enlargement of said window, all blocks become transparent until the mouse is moved or until the player interacts with their keyboard. This reveals all underground caves, thus revealing where ores and other valued blocks can be found without the need to dig.
* If the player opens two windows of the demo, one of them playing the world, but paused, and the other one, on the home menu, reset the demo world and then click back to game on the other window, an error message occurs, and if the player plays the demo, the time is reset, but not the world, and their inventory items are lost, but not the items in the [[block entity|block entities]].

==Trivia==
* Purchased versions of ''Minecraft'' have code from the demo, which was not used until [[Java Edition 1.3]].
* If the [[player]] digs directly underneath the [[sign]] telling them how to open the [[chest]], they can find a [[chest]] that contains 22 [[gunpowder]]. The amount of gunpowder in this chest is supposed to be randomly determined (anywhere from 1 - 88), but the random number generator that determines how much gunpowder is given is seeded with the same number (19) for each new world, thus meaning that it generates the same amount of gunpowder in the same positions each time.

* If the player goes to sleep in a [[bed]] and skips the night, it removes that time from their clock, decreasing their play time.
* While mining, if the player opens and closes their inventory without releasing the {{control|attack}} key, the pickaxe does not move until they stop mining.
* The "PC Gamer" logo can be mined. It is composed of snow blocks, red wool and black wool.
* By editing the level.dat file, it's possible to change the time. Positive number means less time. Negative number means more time. Entering a huge negative value as the time causes the demo timer to show 0:00 but the time still counts.
* The demo disables the F3 [[debug screen]], the F8 [[Cinematic Camera|cinematic camera]], and Shift + F2 to take an extremely high resolution screenshot (a feature of retail Minecraft between Beta 1.2_02 and Beta 1.5). These are all fairly obscure and experimental features, which were likely disabled to avoid confusing new players.
* The player's score (which is always 0 in the retail Beta 1.3) is not shown upon death.
* Debug code that prints the player's position into a log or command line (if one can be printed to) is present. The message "Spawnpos: (a number which is the X location that you spawn at), (a number which is the Z location that you spawn at)" is output to the log every time the player is spawned. An example of this message is "Spawnpos: 166, -57" when spawning into the demo world for the first time.
* The second hint message has a link to the old Minecraft Wiki, at [https://web.archive.org/web/20110412004510/http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki http://www.minecraftwiki.net].
* The screenshots showing what other players have made that appear when the demo runs out were made by users in this reddit thread: https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/g2rd8/i_need_your_help_making_screenshots
