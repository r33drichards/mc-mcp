[[File:Alpha.ogg]]

"Alpha" is a emotional orchestral reprise of some tracks from ''[[Minecraft - Volume Alpha]]''. The song begins with a soft, piano chords playing "[[Minecraft (song)|Minecraft]]" (0:00 - 2:59) with a gradual build-up of strings. Later, a wind instrument plays the main melody of "[[Mice on Venus]]"(3:00), before a full-string orchestra plays out the remainder of the song. Mid-way through, the orchestra slows and stops, while a piano plays another part of "Mice on Venus". The string orchestra then returns to finish out the remaining portion of the song.

A piano once again plays parts of "Mice on Venus" as the song rises into [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imt1rM8WDCo Battlemode 2 from Legacy Console](4:56 - 6:06) which is then transitioned over to a [[wikipedia:Moog synthesizer|Moog synthesizer]] playing "[[Moog City]]" (6:07). The song gradually builds up the Moog synthesizer and piano chords, before a drop causes the Moog synthesizer to become quiet. The piano chords once again build up, joined together by strings. After a final piano drop, the Moog synthesizer plays quietly in the background, as the piano plays the beginning notes of "[[Sweden]]" (8:14). An individual can then be heard getting on a piano and playing the main melody of "Sweden". The song then fades out, as an echoey Moog-like synthesizer plays repeatedly.
