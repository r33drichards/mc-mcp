'''[[Sounds]]'''
* Added new sound events:
** <code>block.coral_block.break</code>, <code>block.coral_block.fall</code>, <code>block.coral_block.hit</code>, <code>block.coral_block.place</code>, and <code>block.coral_block.step</code>
*** Used for the living [[coral block]]s.
*** Most of these sound like mixture of rocky<ref group="note">Rocky sounds are mainly used for stones.</ref> and high-pitched slimy<ref group="note">Slimy sounds are mainly used for [[slime block]]s and [[sea pickle]]s</ref> sounds.
** <code>block.wet_grass.break</code>, <code>block.wet_grass.fall</code>, <code>block.wet_grass.hit</code>, <code>block.wet_grass.place</code>, and <code>block.wet_grass.step</code>

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Seagrass]]'''
* Now deleted by [[kelp]] and [[conduit]]s placed within it. Prior to this update, these were the only blocks which could not replace it.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Dolphin]]s'''
* Changed treasure finding behavior to bring the player more accurately to [[buried treasure]].

=== General ===
'''[[Title screen]]'''
* The comma is replaced with a dot in the copyright notice.

* Many non-Latin alphabet characters and some emoji have been given their own "textured" font. However, some characters (such as kanji and script) still use the unicode font.{{checkthecode|which characters, exactly, were added?}}
* Some non-alphanumeric ascii characters are slightly tweaked to be less wide.

[[File:Font Fix Update Aquatic.gif|thumb|right|300px]]
