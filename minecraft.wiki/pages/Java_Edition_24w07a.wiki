'''24w07a''' is the ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.20.5]], released on February 14, 2024,<ref>{{snap|24w07a|February 14, 2024}}</ref> which adds the [[bogged]] and fixes bugs.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Added <code>gameplay/panda_sneeze</code> loot table for drops when [[panda]]s sneeze.

'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added the <code>#does_not_block_hoppers</code> block tag: contains <code>beehive</code> and <code>bee_nest</code>.
** Controls which blocks never disable a hopper when placed above one.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Hopper]]s'''
* Can now once again pick up items from [[beehive]]s and [[bee nest]]s, but other full blocks still block them.<ref>{{bug|MC-268451||Hoppers can't pull honey bottles from bee hives or bee nests|Fixed}}</ref>

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* The data pack version is now <code>32</code>.

== Experimental ==
=== Additions ===
==== Items ====
'''[[Spawn eggs]]'''
* [[File:Bogged Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bogged spawn egg]]

==== Mobs ====
'''[[File:Bogged JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Bogged]]'''
* A new, mossy and mushroom covered variant of the [[skeleton]] that shoots poisonous arrows.
** Is faster to take down with {{hp|16}} health instead of {{hp|20}} health.
** Attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of skeletons' 2 seconds.
* Has a chance to drop [[arrows of Poison]] when killed by a [[player]].
* Spawns naturally in [[swamp]]s and [[mangrove swamp]]s.
** They're somewhat rare, with their spawn chance being half of that of the skeleton.
** As opposed to [[stray]]s and [[husk]]s, bogged do not require sky access to spawn, and they can also spawn in caves.
* Can spawn from [[trial spawner]]s in some [[trial chambers]].

=== Changes ===
==== Mobs ====
'''[[Parrot]]'''
* Can now imitate bogged sounds.

==== World generation ====
'''[[Trial chambers]]'''
* The spawners that used to spawn skeletons holding arrows of Poison now spawn bogged.

==== Gameplay ====
'''[[Advancement]]s'''
* Killing a bogged now counts for the "Monster Hunter" advancement.
* Bogged are now required for the "Monsters Hunted" advancement.

==== General ====
'''[[Tag]]s'''
* Added <code>bogged</code> to the <code>#no_anger_from_wind_charge</code>, and <code>#skeletons</code> entity type tags.
