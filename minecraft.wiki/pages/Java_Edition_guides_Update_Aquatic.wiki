This guide is a simplified overview of all the changes in [[Update Aquatic]] ({{JE}} 1.13.x releases), which assumes at least some familiarity with the [[World of Color Update]] (''Java Edition'' 1.12.x releases).

|-
| [[Drowned]]
| [[File:Drowned.png|128px|center]]
| Spawn in all ocean, swamp and river biomes. Additionally, groups of drowned spawn in [[ocean ruins]] when the structures are first generated.
|
{{drop|1=item|2=Rotten Flesh|3=0|4=2}}
{{drop|1=item|2=Gold Ingot|3=0|4=1}}
*{{xp|5}} ({{xp|12}} if it's a baby), plus {{xp|1|3}} per equipment piece (when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]])
'''Spawned equipment'''
{{drop|1=item|2=Trident|3=1}}
{{drop|1=item|2=Nautilus Shell|3=1}}
{{drop|1=item|2=Fishing Rod|3=1}}
| During the day, drowned stay on the ground underwater, ignoring players on land no matter how close they may get, they only become hostile during daytime if the player touches [[water]].
|-
| [[Phantom]]
| [[File:Phantom.png|184px|center]]
| Spawn at night and during thunderstorms high above players who are above sea level, have no obstructions above them, and have not entered a bed for at least three ingame days.
| {{drop|1=item|2=Phantom Membrane|3=0|4=1}}
*{{xp|5}} (when killed by a [[player]] or tamed [[wolf]])
|
* Phantoms are the fastest mob in the Overworld. Players are unable to outrun them. A good strategy versus phantoms is to obstruct their path, since they fly up if they collide with any block during an attack.
* [[Cat]]s hiss at phantoms that are currently attacking players, and phantoms try to stay at least 16 blocks away from them.
* Phantoms do not spawn if the player has a solid block above them, meaning they do not spawn around players underground or within enclosed structures. Additionally, they do not spawn if the player is below sea level.
* Sleeping through the night is not actually required. The statistic that controls their spawning is reset when the player leaves a bed, so simply entering and then leaving a bed is enough.

== Advancements ==
{{load advancements|Fishy Business; Tactical Fishing; A Throwaway Joke; Very Very Frightening}}

== Water ==
The physics for [[water]] have also been changed, and the way the player interacts with water has also changed.

=== Swimming ===
There is now an actual swimming animation used by the player while underwater, which can be activated by sprinting underwater. This also allows the player to move in any direction they are looking including down. Players who cannot sprint, i.e. are too hungry to sprint, cannot swim. Crouching underwater also allows the player to descend at a faster rate.

While swimming, players can go through one block gaps similar to when using an [[elytra]].

=== Item and experience ===
Items and experience orbs now float to the surface of water rather than sink, this makes dying underwater easier to deal with because all of the player's items now wait at the surface. This also allows for easy vertical item transportation.

=== Bubble columns ===
[[Magma]] and [[soul sand]] now make [[bubble column]]s when placed underwater. Magma naturally generates in [[underwater ruins]] and where underwater ravines meet lava, while soul sand does not currently generate naturally in oceans. Players are able to breathe while in bubble columns.

Magma bubble columns pull things down to the bottom; this includes items, players, mobs, and boats. Soul sand bubble columns rapidly push all entities, including players, to the surface.

=== Breath ===
The breath meter no longer instantly refills when entering air from underwater; this means it is no longer possible to instantly refill the air meter with a torch while underwater.

=== Vision ===
Water has been given unique colors depending on the biome they are in. Water is also now clearer, and the longer the player is underwater the clearer it becomes.
