'''Mangrove roots''' are blocks that form as part of [[mangrove]] trees. Unlike similar blocks such as [[copper grate]]s, mangrove roots are capable of [[Conductivity|conducting redstone power]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Mangrove roots can be broken by hand, but using an [[axe]] is quickest. Mangrove roots drop themselves when broken with any tool.

{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Mangrove Roots|Axe|link=none}}

=== Natural generation ===
Mangrove roots are generated in [[mangrove swamp]] biomes. They can also generate in some entrance rooms of [[trial chambers]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
When [[mangrove propagule]]s grow, they develop roots that can vary in size.

== Usage ==
Mangrove roots can be [[waterlogged]], despite being a full block. Water does not spread out{{only|je}} and waterlogged mangrove roots follow the same mechanics as any other waterlogged block.

{{IN|Java}}, mobs can spawn on mangrove roots.<ref>{{bug|MC-260628||resolution=WAI}}</ref>

=== Redstone ===
Redstone circuits can pass their power level through mangrove roots and power other redstone components that are adjacent to the block, even when waterlogged. This block is notable in this behavior because it is transparent and both mobs and players will not suffocate while they are inside of it.

=== Crafting ingredient ===
{{crafting usage}}

=== Composting ===
Mangrove roots have a 30% chance of increasing the compost level in a [[composter]] by 1.

=== Fuel ===
Mangrove roots can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s. A block of mangrove roots lasts 15 seconds (smelting up to 1.5 items).

=== Note blocks ===
Mangrove roots can be placed under [[note block]]s to produce "bass" sounds.
