A '''dried ghast''' is an immobile, shriveled, harmless [[ghast]] in the form of a [[block]]. It can be found near [[Nether fossil]]s or obtained through [[bartering]] or [[crafting]]. Placing it in [[water]] will cause it to hydrate over time until it becomes a [[ghastling]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
A dried ghast can be [[instant mining|instantly mined]] with any tool or by hand, and it always drops itself when mined. If mined while waterlogged, it reverts to its "dry" state regardless of which state it has reached while waterlogged.

=== Natural generation ===
Dried ghasts naturally generate in [[soul sand valley]]s as part of [[Nether fossil]]s and have a {{Fraction|1|3}} (~33.3%) chance of spawning next to one.

=== Bartering ===
[[Piglin]]s have a {{frac|10|469}} (~2.13%) chance to [[barter]] a dried ghast when given a [[gold ingot]].

== Usage ==
When a dried ghast is [[waterlogged]], it initiates a rehydration process: green particles appear, and the ghast gradually develops a smiling expression and becomes brighter in color. These visual changes appear in stages, becoming noticeable after about 5 minutes (partially hydrated), more pronounced after about 10 minutes (mostly hydrated), and visually complete (hydrated) after about 15 minutes. After about 20 minutes, it transforms into a [[ghastling]], which matures over time into a [[happy ghast]].

If the water is removed during the process, the ghast slowly reverts to the original, dried state at the same rate as it hydrates. Breaking a dried ghast instantly reverts it to the dried state.

The exact timings are somewhat randomized: To reach the next stage of hydration or dehydration, a 250 second delay (5000 [[ticks]]) must run out, but that delay does not start automatically. Instead, it begins when the dried ghast receives a [[random tick]], i.e. on average after about 68 seconds, for a total of about 5.3 minutes on average.

=== Ambient sounds ===
A non-waterlogged dried ghast emits cracking ambient sounds when it is placed on [[soul sand]] or [[soul soil]].
