'''Torchflower seeds''' are ancient<ref> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJ2dzVcOgg</ref> seeds that have a chance to be dropped by [[sniffer]]s when they finish digging. It is the seed of [[torchflower]]s.

== Obtaining ==
[[Sniffer]]s occasionally bury their nose in the ground and start digging. Once the sniffer has finished digging, there is a 50% chance for one torchflower seed to be dropped as an item.

Sniffers can dig for torchflower seeds in the following blocks:

* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
Sniffers cannot dig for torchflower seeds on [[mycelium]].<ref>{{bug|MC-260259||Sniffers cannot dig nor find seeds on mycelium|WAI}}</ref>

=== Breaking ===
{{Breaking row|Torchflower Crop|link=none|horizontal=1}}

== Usage ==
=== Crop ===
{{main|Tutorial:Crop farming|title1=Crop farming}}

Torchflower seeds can be {{control|placed}} on [[farmland]], where they grow through three stages. Breaking the torchflower crop before it matures drops the seed, while breaking the final stage produces one [[torchflower]] and does not yield the seed.

Crops break if pushed by a [[piston]] or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

Farmer [[villager]]s can plant torchflower seeds, but cannot harvest them after they have fully grown.<ref>{{bug|MC-263382||Villagers can plant torchflower crops and pitcher crops but cannot harvest them once they've fully grown|WAI}}</ref>

=== Feeding ===
Torchflower seeds can be used to [[breed]] [[sniffer]]s and [[chicken]]s, and to reduce the remaining growth duration of snifflets and chicks by 10%. {{IN|be}}, feeding a sniffer a torchflower seed heals it by {{hp|2}} health points.

=== Taming ===
Torchflower seeds can be used to tame [[parrot]]s.

=== Composting ===
Placing torchflower seeds into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

== Trivia ==
* The final growth stage of the torchflower crop uses the same ID as the actual torchflower. This causes some side effects, such as the plant becoming offset and randomly jumping to the side.<ref>{{bug|MC-260472||Torchflowers have a random position offset but its crops do not|WAI}}</ref>
