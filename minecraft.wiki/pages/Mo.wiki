'''Mo''' is a character in the ''[[Minecraft Mini-Series]]'' and part of Team Mooshroom with [[Slugger]].

== Appearance ==
Mo has a red and white mushroom hat covering her black colored eyes, brown hair, light skin, gray [[mycelium]] colored tunic, a red belt, brown wrist pads, dark gray pants, and bare feet.

== Biography ==
Before the series began, Mo was mushroom hunter.

Mo was once teleported along with [[Slugger]] by [[CommuniKate]] using a [[command block]]. During the challenges, she dug many tunnels under the islands, and then triggered her own death by explosion to save her friends. Mo then appears in the finale and discusses a sabotage plan to return home with the other heroes. Their sabotage succeeds, but instead of going home, they are teleported to the [[Greek Isles]]. [[Poseidon]] teleported Mo to a sand pillar in the [[Kraken]] Sea along with the other heroes, and she spent most of the season there. Then at the end, all the heroes escape and try to stop Poseidon. After a while, [[Zeus]] comes, stops Poseidon, and asks heroes to help him. After helping the god, Mo and Slugger apparently returned home.

== Personality ==
Mo is fairly reserved and quiet. She enjoys helping people and finding alternative ways to get out of situations or fix problems and mistakes.

== Relationships ==
=== Slugger ===
Apparently, Mo and Slugger were friends before the series began, and maintained this relationship until the end of the series.

=== Quinn ===
They've been friends since Episode 2, always helping each other out during challenges and eventually stopping CommunitKate's gameshow.

== Trivia ==
* Mo is based on the "Mushroom Hunter" from Mattel which in turn was based on a skin by the same name in the [[Biome Settlers Skin Pack 2]].
