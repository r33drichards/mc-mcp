'''Conductivity''' is a [[block property]] that determines whether redstone signals can be conducted through them (i.e. [[powered]]). When conductive blocks receive a redstone signal, they are able to activate redstone [[Redstone components#Mechanism components|mechanism components]], and may be able to power adjacent redstone dust. Conductive and non-conductive blocks also have properties not related to redstone; for example, mob spawning, and suffocation.

Conductive blocks are often called '''opaque blocks''' because many common blocks that can be powered are [[opaque]]; for example, [[stone]], [[dirt]], [[wood]]. Non-conductive blocks are often called '''transparent blocks''' because the most common example is [[glass]]. However, whether or not you can see through the block does not determine whether a block can be powered. Most opaque blocks share a similar set of properties, and most transparent blocks share their own set.

== Properties ==
[[Opaque]] [[full block]]s (like [[stone]]) tend to be conductive while partial blocks (like [[slabs]]) or [[transparent]] blocks (like [[glass]]) tend to be non-conductive. However, there are numerous exceptions (see below).

Many effects of conductivity are non-obvious. ''Minecraft'' [[Block properties#Solid properties|does not have a single "solid" property for blocks]], and for historical reasons, conductivity is sometimes used when a test for solidity is needed.

[[File:Cut Redstone 1.png|thumb|The conductive gold block cuts the redstone dust, preventing it from connecting vertically and does not transmit a signal; the non-conductive tinted glass does not cut the redstone dust, allowing it to connect vertically and transmit a signal]]

'''Common properties of conductive blocks:'''

*can be [[powered]]
*prevent [[chest]]s from opening when placed on top of them
*[[suffocate]]s [[mob]]s inside them
*can "cut" [[redstone dust]] (prevent redstone dust from connecting vertically, see image)
*redstone dust can transmit a signal up or down a conductive block
*[[redstone comparator]]s can measure block state through a conductive block unless its power level is 15.

Other properties may include:
*[[bat]]s can hang upside down on conductive blocks
*[[ghast]] fireballs start fires on conductive blocks
*[[minecart]]s "bounce off" conductive blocks if a minecart passes over a powered rail pointing into a conductive block

'''Common properties of non-conductive blocks:'''

*cannot be powered
*do not prevent chest from opening when placed on top of them
*do not suffocate mobs inside them
*mobs cannot [[Mob spawning|spawn]] inside conductive blocks. Conductive blocks also play a part in the [[Mob spawning#Pack spawning|pack spawning]] algorithm{{only|je}}.
*do not cut redstone dust (prevent from connecting vertically)
*redstone dust can only transmit a signal up a non-conductive block, not down {{only|je}}
*redstone comparators cannot measure block state through non-conductive blocks

Other properties may include:
*bats cannot hang upside down on them
*ghast fireballs do not start fires on them
*minecarts stop when passing over a powered rail and colliding with a non-conductive block

'''Unique conductive blocks'''

As noted above, most conductive blocks are full solid blocks with the exception of [[soul sand]] and [[mud]] (7/8 of a block tall). 

[[Mangrove roots]], [[monster spawner]]s{{only|bedrock}}, [[trial spawner]]s{{only|bedrock}}, closed [[shulker box]]es{{only|bedrock}} and [[barrier]]s are the only conductive blocks that can be waterlogged.

[[Target]] blocks and [[jukebox]]es are unique in that they attract redstone dust.

'''Unique non-conductive blocks'''

[[Blocks of redstone]], [[observer]]s, and [[piston]]s are full solid blocks made of materials with the solid-blocking property, but are non-conductive.

'''Non-conductive block placement behavior'''

Many non-conductive blocks exhibit their own unique behavior regarding what blocks can be placed on them, and what blocks they can be placed on. See [[Opacity/Placement]].

For example, leaves are a full solid non-conductive block, but certain redstone-related blocks cannot be placed on them: 

*{{BlockLink|Redstone dust}}
*{{BlockLink|Redstone repeater}}
*{{BlockLink|Redstone comparator}}
*{{BlockLink|Button}}
*{{BlockLink|Lever}}
*{{BlockLink|Tripwire hook}}
*{{BlockLink|Rail}}, and its varieties
