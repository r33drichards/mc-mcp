'''1.17.1 Pre-release 1''' (known as '''1.17.1-pre1''' in the launcher) is the first pre-release for [[Java Edition 1.17.1]], released on June 18, 2021,<ref>{{Mcnet|minecraft-1-17-1-pre-release-1|Minecraft 1.17.1 Pre-Release 1|June 18, 2021}}</ref> which tweaks some game mechanics and fixes bugs.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Cauldron]]s'''
* [[Powder snow]] now fills cauldrons twice as fast as before.

=== Items ===
'''[[Spyglass]]'''
* Tweaked held model texture to include glass on the backside.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Axolotl]]'''
* Blue axolotls now only spawn through [[breeding]].

'''[[Drowned]]'''
* Increased the drop probability of [[copper ingot]] from 5% to 11%, and increased the drop rate boost with each level of the [[Looting]] enchantment from 1% to 2%.
** This change is to match {{BE}}'s drop rates.

'''[[Goat]]s'''
* Breeding common goats now has a chance to produce screaming goats.
* Status effects applied to goats now also apply when the goat is jumping or ramming.

'''[[Zombie]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s and [[drowned]]'''
* No longer pick up [[glow ink sac]]s.
** This prevents zombies from persisting after picking up the loot of a dead [[glow squid]].

=== General ===
'''Protocol'''
* Handshake packet padding method for "hostname" and "port" field has reverted to pre-1.17 when the server address which used is a SRV record.
** Now, data padded in these field will use the address and port which SRV record pointed at, instead of using "server address" as "hostname" and 25565 as "port".

'''Fonts'''
* Some new characters have been added.
** Includes several currency symbols and some new emoji.
** The new characters are: <span style="word-break:break-all;">₺✂🍖🪣🔔⏳⚑₠₡₢₣₤₥₦₩₫₭₮₰₱₲₳₵₶₷₸₹₺₻₼₿</span>
