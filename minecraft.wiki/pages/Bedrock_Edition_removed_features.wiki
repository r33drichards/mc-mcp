{{cleanup|Remove redundant information}}
{{outdated|edition=bedrock|These features only exist in outdated versions of Bedrock Edition.}}

Since the beginning of the development of {{els|pe|be}}, there have been a number of features that were removed from the game. These features may have been replaced, or a developer decided against the feature later on.

'''Note:''' This page only documents game features that were removed; features of an existing game element that were removed are noted in that element's history. See [[Bedrock Edition unused features]] for features that are still currently in the game.

{{main|Copper Horn}}
The '''copper horn''' was an item used to play sound. There were 10 variations of copper horns, and each of them played 3 different sounds: when looking up, crouching, or doing neither of those. In total, there were 30 different sounds that could be played using copper horns. 

In the [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.19.0.24|beta 1.19.0.24]], the Copper Horn was removed. Mojang in the [[Feedback site|Minecraft Feedback]]'s Knowledge Base saids "the Copper Horn was a fun experiment that didn't quite live up to our design goals, so we decided to remove it".<ref>[https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/5540500564365-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-19-0-24-25#:~:text=Removed%20Copper%20Horn,better%20features%20in%20the%20future! https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/5540500564365-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-19-0-24-25#Removed%20Copper%20Horn]</ref>

== Structures ==

=== Nether reactor ===
[[File:Nether Reactor.png|125px|right]]
{{main|Nether Reactor}}

Prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha]], a Nether reactor could be activated in survival by tapping its core, sending the client message "Active!". Immediately after activation, a massive 35×17×17 structure of [[netherrack]] with multiple rooms, unofficially referred to as a "Nether Spire",<ref name="johan 0.5.0 vid2">https://www.twitch.tv/jbernhardsson/b/337680976</ref> was generated around the reactor, then the cobblestone would turn to glowing obsidian and pigmen would start spawning along with Nether related items such as quartz. Over time the reactor would cool, and once it diminished the glowing obsidian would turn into normal obsidian. The reactor was constructed by placing [[gold block]]s, [[cobblestone]], and a [[Nether reactor core]] in the 3×3×3 arrangement shown below. The Nether Reactor's functions were removed after the Nether was added into Pocket Edition, but can still be obtained, without its functionality, using an external editor.

== Gameplay ==
=== Powered rail ===

Prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.13.0 alpha build 1]], any placed [[powered rail]] would be always active. This was because [[redstone]] mechanics did not exist at the time.

=== Splashes ===
When a splash is removed, the line it occupied in splashes.json is deleted, meaning the line number of all subsequent splashes lowers by one.

It is unknown why most of the splashes were removed. Most were following the purchase of Minecraft by Microsoft.

=== Sprinting in water ===

Prior to [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.13.8]] the [[player]] could [[sprint]] in [[water]]. This feature was removed soon after due to the new [[swimming]] mechanic.  In Mobile on Bedrock Edition however, you can still do that by sprinting first then hold sprint and one of the buttons that uses to go up in the water simultaneously.

=== UI ===
There have been many UIs that have been changed, such as the [[crafting table]]. The crafting table UI has changed since [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0]], but before that version, the crafting table had already previously been changed. Early UI for the crafting table had text showing item information could be crafted. This is similar to the [[Stonecutter (old)|stonecutter]] UI, which later changed in [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha build 1]]. From [[Pocket Edition v0.13.0 alpha|v0.13.0]], when the crafting table's UI was changed, the stonecutter UI was completely removed and its use was re-purposed to a decorative block. Also, the [[furnace]] text of output items and information of that item could be used.

=== UI text information ===
As the old UI was removed, text information showed in that UI was also removed.

=== Enhanced underwater visibility ===

Before [[Bedrock Edition 1.4.0]], wearing an enchanted [[helmet]] with the [[Respiration]] enchantment would boost underwater vision. The higher the level, the better it improved the [[player]]'s vision. This enhanced vision has since been removed, due to the [[water]] texture being changed and because the player can now see clearly underwater without effects or enchantments. However, [[Night Vision]] is still required for better visibility. Also, enhanced underwater vision is still obtainable from other methods, such as [[Conduit Power]] from [[conduit]]s added in [[Bedrock Edition 1.5.0]].

=== Full hotbar ===
Before the [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0|Better Together update]], creating a world in [[Creative mode]] always had a full hotbar, which included oak saplings, bricks, oak planks, spruce planks, cobblestone walls, dirt, etc. (dependent on the sixth to ninth hotbar slots).

=== Tilling grass ===
In older versions, tilling a [[grass block]] with a [[hoe]] had a small chance of dropping wheat seeds. This feature was removed in [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha|alpha v0.12.1]].

== Accidental Education Edition additions ==

Several features intended to be exclusive to {{el|ee}} were accidentally added in the [[Pocket Edition v0.16.0 alpha build 1|first build]] of [[Pocket Edition v0.16.0 alpha]], and were removed shortly after. Among these features were the [[Allow]] block, [[Deny]] block, [[chalkboard]] block, [[border]] block and the [[portfolio]] item. Some of these items were readded in [[Bedrock Edition 1.12.0|1.12.0]], [[bedrock Edition 1.13.0|1.13.0]], and [[bedrock Edition 1.16.0|1.16.0]].

== Entities ==

=== Instant chicken jockeys ===
Prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1]], [[chicken jockey]]s had a chance of spawning from [[zombie]]s, [[zombified piglin]]s, and their [[spawn egg]]s. At that time, [[baby zombie]]s and [[baby zombified piglin]]s had a 5% chance to spawn as a chicken jockey. However, as of [[Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1|v0.14.0 build 1]], chicken jockeys were partially removed and no longer spawn naturally, but [[baby zombie]]s, [[baby zombie villager]]s and [[baby husk]]s  have a 15% chance to spawn as a jockey when trying to attack the [[player]], [[villager]]s, [[iron golem]]s or [[snow golem]]s. Said jockeys will seek and mount nearby [[mob]]s that can be ridden, such as [[cow]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[horse]]s. However, baby zombified piglins did not have the ability to mount nearby mobs, causing zombified piglin chicken jockeys to be completely removed.

=== Chickens spawning in the Nether ===
Due to the natural zombified piglin chicken jockey removal, [[chicken]]s are no longer able to spawn naturally in the [[Nether]], as zombified piglins will no longer spawn as zombified piglin chicken jockeys.

=== Hostile zombified piglin drops and behavior ===
Before [[Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha]], [[zombified piglin]]s dropped [[feather]]s as common drops and [[potato]]es or [[carrot]]s as rare drops. This was changed in [[Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha build 1|v0.11.0 build 1]]; in this update, the zombified piglin's common drop was changed to [[rotten flesh]] and its rare drop was changed to [[gold ingot]]s. In Alpha 0.12.1 build 1, [[gold nugget]]s were also added as common drops.

Before Alpha 0.12.1 build 1, zombified piglins were hostile mobs that burned in sunlight but were also immune to fire. However, during this time, fire particles would still be shown around them, even though the zombified piglins themselves did not take any damage. During this time, they also lacked a hat layer, moved slowly, and both of their hands did not draw up. In Alpha 0.11.0 build 1, they had a [[chicken jockey]] variant, but in [[Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1|v0.14.0 build 1]], their chicken jockey variant was removed and prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha build 1|v0.12.1 build 1]], the only way to make the variant spawn naturally was from an active [[Nether reactor core]]. In [[Pocket Edition v0.14.0 alpha build 1|v0.14.0 build 1]], adult zombified piglins were mountable by the baby zombified variants. In [[Pocket Edition v0.12.0 alpha|v0.12.0]], zombie pigmen had a small chance to spawn with armor but then removed.

=== Tamed ocelots ===
[[Ocelot]]s were tameable by feeding them raw cod or raw salmon to transform them into cats. However, in [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.8.0.8|Beta 1.8.0.8]], ocelots and cats became separate mobs, and giving them any type of fish will just breed them and gain the trust of the player and increase baby ocelot growth speed by 10% rather than taming them.

== Mob behavior ==

=== Magma cubes taking damage when wet ===
[[Magma cube]]s previously took damage when they became wet, as the vanilla behavior pack had the magma cube's behavior <code>magma_cube_hurt_when_wet</code> set to <code>true</code>. Magma cubes would also take damage if exposed to sunlight or moonlight during rain and while in the water. However, as of an unknown build in 1.1, this feature was considered a bug and removed, as its vanilla behavior of taking damage when wet was set to <code>false</code> again.

=== Horses ===
When [[horse]]s were added, they used an older model, which was replaced with a newer model in [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.6.2]]. In the earlier versions of [[Pocket Edition v0.15.0 alpha/Development versions|v0.15.0 builds]], horses could be tamed by feeding them food, although this feature was removed and now the [[player]] is required to mount the horse to tame it.

=== Breedable dolphins ===
When the [[dolphin]] was added in [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.20.1]], it was breedable by feeding them [[raw cod]] or [[raw salmon]]. However, in [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.5.0.0|beta 1.5.0.0]], feeding a dolphin with raw fish will make it swim toward the nearest [[ocean ruins]] or [[shipwreck]]. Baby dolphins can only spawn naturally in the ocean and not via breeding.

=== Villagers avoiding monsters ===

At an earlier version where [[villager]]s were added to the game, they would avoid any type of monster, including neutral mobs such as endermen and spiders. However, in [[Pocket Edition v0.12.0 alpha]], this feature was removed, as villagers now only avoid zombie variants and [[illager]]s as of [[Pocket Edition 1.1.0]]

=== Baby mobs with adult sounds ===
In earlier versions of [[Pocket Edition Alpha]], all baby versions of mobs used the same sounds as their adult counterparts, rather than the high-pitched versions that they use now.

=== Burning attack ===
In [[Pocket Edition Alpha]], if a mob that is set on fire attacks another mob, the mob would always transfer its burning effect to the mob it attacked. For mobs that could fire a projectile, such as the [[Snow Golem]], its projectiles would always be set on fire. However, as of an [[Pocket Edition v0.16.0 alpha build 1]], burning attacks now depend on regional difficulty.

=== Mobs always dropping armor but not items ===
In [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha]], mobs could spawn with equipment, but if the mob was killed, it would always drop its armor, even when killed from [[cacti]], falling, [[drowning]], or otherwise dying. However, they would never drop an item held in their hand (an exception was the [[witch]], which would always drop whichever potion it was drinking upon death).

As of [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0|1.2.0]], this feature was removed, and now a mob with a weapon and/or armor equipped will drop any of its equipped items when killed by a player, and only at an 8.5% chance for each item. This includes potions dropped by [[witch]]es.

=== Mobs breathing in lava ===
Previously, any mobs under the Fire Resistance effect could stay submerged under lava without suffocation. As of an unknown update, this feature was removed and only some mobs, such as the [[Blaze]] and the [[Ghast]], are able to breathe in lava. Now, the player and most other mobs require either the Water Breathing or Conduit Power status effects in order to breathe in lava.

=== Old mob death animation ===
Before [[Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha]], mobs would jump and then disappear when killed by the player; this was later changed to the mob falling into the ground and then disappearing, just like in Java Edition.

=== Guardians attacking fish ===

In [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.2.14.2|beta 1.2.14.2]], [[guardian]]s were hostile toward [[cod]], [[salmon]], [[pufferfish]], and [[tropical fish]], but this feature was removed in the [[Bedrock Edition 1.6.0/Development versions|1.6.0 betas]] due to a performance issue with low-end devices when the player is near a [[monument]].

== Particles ==
For testing purposes, some particles which couldn't generate naturally were added in several versions.<ref>{{tweet|HelenAngel|1056075978647064576|If you were wondering about some of the cool stuff you can do with Bedrock’s new particle system...|October 26, 2018}}</ref> However, these particles have since been removed.

== Food ==

=== Healing ===
Prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha build 1]], eating food would heal the [[player]] directly. With the addition of the [[hunger bar]], this feature was removed.

=== Pufferfish ===
Before [[Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha build 1]], eating [[pufferfish]] would not inflict the [[poison]] status effect.

== World generation ==

=== Biomes ===
;Biomes prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha]]

Before Alpha 0.9.0, many biomes existed, most of which were removed. Biomes prior to Alpha 0.9.0 are identical to Java Edition's biomes between the [[Halloween Update]] and the [[Adventure Update]], as well as [[Legacy Console Edition]]'s biomes before [[Legacy Console Edition version history|TU5]].

Biomes that got removed in Alpha 0.9.0:
*[[Rainforest]]
*[[Seasonal Forest]]
*[[Shrubland]]
*[[Swamp]]land (Older version)
*[[Savanna]] (Older version)
*[[Tundra]]
*[[Beach]]es ([[Sand]] and [[Gravel]], prior to [[Adventure Update]]).

Before [[Bedrock Edition 1.2.0]], [[temperature]] didn't reduce with height, as a result, [[rain]] always occurred regardless of altitude and [[extreme hills]] and its variants didn't generate snow above Y=90.

=== Villages ===
;Gravel paths
Before [[Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha build 1]], [[village]]s used [[gravel]] paths; however, this was changed and [[dirt path]]s are now used instead.

;Oak savanna villages
Prior to [[Pocket Edition v0.15.0 alpha build 1]], [[village]]s that would generate in [[savanna]] biomes used oak [[wood]], oak wood [[planks]], oak [[fence]]s, and oak [[stair]]s, but this village was later replaced with the acacia village.

=== Trees ===
;"Cold-en" oak trees
Cold-en oak trees were a bugged tree with the shape of an oak but the blocks of a spruce that would generate on the borders of warm and cold biomes in early {{PE}} versions.

<gallery>
ColdenOak.jpg
ColdenOakTree.png
</gallery>

;Old oak trees

At the same time that cold-en oak trees existed, [[oak tree]]s at the time would only generate with 2 [[log]]s in a canopy rather than 3.

=== Mineshafts ===
;Spider spawners
When [[mineshaft]]s were added to [[Pocket Edition]] in [[Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha build 1|v0.9.0 build 1]], it would generate a [[monster spawner]] with a [[spider]] inside of it instead of a [[cave spider]], which was because cave spiders didn't exist in Pocket Edition yet.

=== Nether Spires ===
{{see also|Nether Spire/Structure}}
[[File:Nether Spire Revision 1.png|thumb|A Nether Spire in [[Pocket Edition v0.5.0 alpha|v0.5.0]].]]
[[File:Nether Spire.jpg|thumb|A Nether Spire as it appeared in [[Pocket Edition v0.6.0 alpha|v0.6.0]] onwards.]]
The Nether Spire (referred to as <code>Dome</code> in the code) was a huge structure consisting of [[netherrack]] that generated when a [[Nether reactor core]] was activated. It would replace many blocks and started spawning multiple rare items and [[zombie pigmen]]. When the [[Nether reactor core]] stopped working, all the reactor blocks that had already become [[glowing obsidian]] transformed into normal [[obsidian]]. The Nether Spire structure would start to break, causing holes to form on the outside. It also set the time to night. The Nether Spire consisted of many floors and would destroy many blocks in its path.

If the Nether Spire generated in a high place, the upper part of the Nether spire would not generate properly and become cut off due to the then-128 block height limit. Activating the Nether Reactor Core at Y=1 would cause the bedrock to be replaced with netherrack (making it possible to fall into the Void).

=== Far Lands ===
{{main|Far Lands (Bedrock Edition)}}
[[File:FarLandsEdge PocketEdition.jpg|thumb|The Far Lands at X=+12,550,821.]]
[[File:Cornerfarlands pe.png|thumb|The "corner" of the Far Lands, at +12,550,821 on both X and Z axes, forming the skygrid.]]
[[File:Negative Far Lands2.jpg|thumb|The Far Lands at X=-12,550,821, forming an endless ocean.]]
The Far Lands was the area that formed the "edge" of the "infinite" map {{in|be}} versions prior to [[Bedrock Edition 1.17.30|1.17.30]]. They initiated approximately 12,550,821 blocks from the center of the world, at X/Z 0. The Far Lands had three variations: The Edge Far Lands, the skygrid, and nothingness.

The Edge Far Lands and the skygrid both featured extremely strange terrain. The Edge Far Lands formed a solid wall that extended up to Y=127, with extremely long, large holes perpendicular to the edge. This wall pattern continued below ground level to the bottom of the map. The Edge Far Lands became less dense as the player ventured further out, transitioning completely into nothingness by X/Z +12,758,545.

The skygrid consisted of a 3D pattern of surface layer blocks that extended from Y=127 to the bottom of the map. In later versions of the game prior to their removal, the skygrid only generated in the Nether and the End, with the same areas in the Overworld being occupied by nothingness.

In nothingness, terrain stopped generating entirely, with the only features being the ocean and the bedrock layer. Certain structures could still generate in this area, and the surface of the ocean was frozen in cold biomes.

The Edge Far Lands, the skygrid, and nothingness were all removed in [[Bedrock Edition beta 1.17.20.20]].
{{-}}

===Old world type===
{{main|Old}}

The Old world type was created to provide smaller worlds on older or low-end devices that did not perform well with infinite worlds. As of [[beta 1.18.0.22]], the Old world type was removed from being created.

=== Nether in Old world type ===
Nether Portals cannot be activated in the [[Old]] world type unless converted to the Infinite world type. 

As of Alpha 0.16.0 build 5, commands can be used by players to access the Nether in the Old world type without converting it to Infinite by using commands {{cmd|setblock}} or {{cmd|fill}} with the Nether Portal.

The Nether in the Old world type looks like the normal Nether but is limited in size. It is the same size as the Overworld, which is 256×256 with a 128 block height. However, since the Nether and the Overworld have the same size, and traveling 1 block in the Nether is still equal to traveling 8 blocks in the Overworld, this leads to a problem that can make the game freeze or crash. This is the reason why the Nether can not be accessed in the Old world type. When the [[player]] goes to the Nether, a new [[Nether portal]] generates naturally in the Overworld, because a portal placed with commands is not counted. However, the player cannot make a Nether portal normally.

=== End in Old world type ===
The End Dimension was added, and alongside it the End in the Old world type. The End is inaccessible because strongholds never generate in the Old world type and building an end portal also does not work. The only way to access it is via block-placement commands such as {{cmd|setblock}} and {{cmd|fill}}.

Unlike the Nether in Old worlds, which can generate all structures, The End here generates just the main island and not the outer islands, due to the size limit of 256×256 blocks.

However, sometimes the End in the Old world type generates improperly, resulting in the central island not generating due to the border. If this happens, the [[ender dragon]] may get stuck in mid-air at the border, and the exit portal generates halfway or does not appear. The [[end gateway portal]] is also nonfunctional, due to the size limit.

These problems are the reasons why the End dimension is normally inaccessible, as the only way to go back to the Overworld is via cheats or death.

== Sounds ==
Many sounds were removed in Bedrock Edition, such as old footsteps, old breaking block sounds, old [[glass]] and metal block sounds, old sounds for [[cow]]s, [[zombie villager]]s, [[husk]]s, [[stray]]s, [[explosion]] sounds, [[water]], and [[squid]]s, along with others.

"Old Hurt" still exists with the {{cmd|playsound random.hurt @s}} command.

=== Crying Obsidian texture ===
{{main|Crying Obsidian}}
[[File:Crying Obsidian (texture) JE0 BE0.png|right|alt=|Old crying obsidian texture]]
The old texture of Crying Obsidian was added in [[Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha]] with [[terrain.png]] what matches [[Java Edition Beta 1.3]]. It was removed in [[Pocket Edition v0.2.0 alpha|v0.2.0]], as terrain.png has now been changed to match up with [[Java Edition 1.1]].

As of [[Bedrock Edition 1.16.0|1.16]], these blocks were added to the game. For ''[[Java Edition]]'' since [[Java Edition 1.16|1.16]] ([[20w10a]]), this texture was re-added in [[Programmer Art]].
