'''Air''' is an [[Invisible block|invisible]] [[block]] used to define unoccupied space where other blocks and [[items]] could exist; it represents the absence of a block or an item. It is one of the few blocks in the game that players cannot normally interact with.

'''Cave air'''{{only|java}} is a variant found only underground in [[carver cave]]s and some [[Structure|generated structure]]s along with [[feature]]s like [[lava lake]]s.

'''Void air'''{{only|java}} is a variant used internally for the 'air' in unloaded chunks and outside of the world height limits (above Y=319 and below Y=-64 in the [[Overworld]], and above Y=255 and below Y=0 in [[the Nether]] and [[the End]] dimensions).

== Appearance ==
All types of air are completely invisible.

The only exception is that air can be visualized with the use of [[structure block]]s in [[Structure Block#Save|Save mode]]: when "Show invisible blocks" is enabled, air is represented as small blue cubes. Air, cave air, and void air are all displayed identically.

== Obtaining ==
{{IN|Bedrock}}, air cannot be obtained in the [[inventory]] without editing.

{{IN|Java}}, the block is completely unobtainable as an item. When attempting to use commmands with air as an item ID:

* Using {{cmd|give}} does nothing.
* Using {{cmd|clear}} will always always fail to find any matching items.
* Using {{cmd|item replace}} deletes the item in the specified slot.
* Using {{cmd|summon}} to attempt to create an item entity (i.e. <code>/summon item ~ ~ ~ {Item:{id:"air"}}</code>) does nothing.

As a block, air can be destroyed or created only by the placement or removal of other [[block]]s respectively. When using commands such as {{cmd|fill}}, specifying air deletes other blocks.

=== Natural generation ===
Upon world generation, all otherwise empty spaces are occupied by air.

{{IN|java}}, carver caves and some underground structures generate containing cave air instead, including [[mineshaft]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-125112||Surface mineshafts in mesas use cave_air|WF}}</ref>, [[stronghold]]s, [[monster room]]s, and [[lava lake]]s<ref>{{bug|MC-128250||Surface water and lava ponds use cave_air|WF}}</ref>, and void air is used in place of unloaded chunks and above or below the [[world]]'s buildable area to denote illegal locations for blocks to be put.

{{block distribution}}

=== Post-generation ===
When other [[block]]s are destroyed by any means, air is created.

== Usage ==
[[File:Shown Invisible Blocks.png|thumb|250px|Air, shown at left, is represented by blue cubes within structures. Cave air and void air are also shown as such.]]

Air shares some properties with non-[[solid block]]s, including allowing the [[player]] or [[mob]] to move within that space without [[suffocating]], and also to catch their breath if they are [[drowning]] in [[water]].

Cave air and void air have no special properties; they function the same as normal air.

=== Piston interactivity ===
Air and its variants are destroyed when pushed by a [[piston]]. They cannot be pulled by [[sticky piston]]s.
