[[File:Spleefplayshot.png|thumb|400px|Two players playing Spleef in [[Java Edition Beta 1.7.3]].]]

'''Spleef''' is a community created competitive [[minigame]] played within ''[[Minecraft]]''. When playing spleef, [[player]]s destroy [[hardness|easily breakable]] [[block]]s (typically [[snow]] or [[wool]]) below other players, allowing them to fall off the playing field into a pit. The object of the game is to stay as the last player on the field.

The name is a combination of the word ''splat'', referring to the sound of players hitting the ground below, and the word ''grief'', as the game involves destroying blocks.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/words-from-minecraft/|title=Words From Minecraft: What Are Your Kids Saying?|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>

== Background ==
Spleef was started on a server before June 23, 2009 soon after the [[Java Edition Classic]] Multiplayer [[Creative]] Mode release. The rules and name were created by Greenslimy, Pentaclam, and Maulrus.{{cn}} It first gained popularity after [[Notch]] blogged about this article on his Tumblr.<ref>[[wordofnotch:128905625]]</ref> Soon after, a plethora of spleef servers and variations sprung up. Spleef instantly caught on in ''[[Minecraft]]'' Classic, while slowly also gaining popularity in Alpha, which soon became Beta. It is considerably popular in the latest version of ''Minecraft'' today, with a lot of public servers having some kind of Spleef arena.
<!--
It is questionable, but it could have started as a port from Blockland to ''Minecraft''. In 2004, Blockland was a "spleef" where you would throw spears at the blocks and they would disappear, thus killing anyone on them. Someone who played this may have re-created it in ''Minecraft'' and others started doing it too.

Tron 2.0 featured a similar game mode in 2002, with opposing teams using the Tron disc to destroy platforms on either side of a chasm.

== Playing field ==
Spleef is played on platforms consisting of easily-destructible blocks such as [[snow]], [[leaves]], or [[TNT]], with a pit located under the playing field to collect players when they lose. Players destroy blocks on the platform near or under opponents to cause them to fall, while avoiding falling themselves. Those who fall from the platform lose the round, while the remaining players win. Spleef can be played on teams, in 1v1 scenarios, or with multiple players all against each other.

== Rules ==
Spleef has a few basic rules to ensure a fair experience without being too restrictive, but as with many activities, rules vary greatly from one server to another.

* Creating blocks between the game's start and end is forbidden.
* Creating or destroying blocks after you have lost the round is not allowed.
* The losers must replace the blocks that were deleted during the game after the round is over. (Optional, occasionally a script or [[commands]] / [[command block]]s are used instead)
* If players have entered a stalemate and are all on separate "islands", and unable to access each other to continue to play, either the person with the most space wins, or the arena is reset to continue play. Usually, the latter happens only in arenas that use a script to reset the play field.
* Hitting players is against the rules, except in variations.

== Spleef arena ==

Since spleef requires the playing field to be easily broken, most arenas use [[snow]] or [[clay]] blocks as they can be broken relatively quickly. Some basic arenas use dirt if better materials are not available. [[Wool]] can also be used.

Spleef players should be equipped with a [[shovel]] (or [[shears]], for wool) to ensure fast block destruction.

Walls surrounding the arena are usually made to prevent players from evading gameplay. The walls are often made with hard to mine materials, such as [[cobblestone]], [[bricks]], [[obsidian]], or even [[bedrock]]. There is often seating for spectators located on the side of the field, so that they can view the players in the arena.

There is usually a pit located below the arena with a tunnel or stairway out for losers to exit the arena. On longer drops, arena builders can use [[water]] to prevent the losers from taking [[Damage#Fall damage|fall damage]].

Many stadium builders fill the pit with [[lava]] as an intimidating consequence for losing. Often they provide chests for participants to store their items so they do not lose their items if they die.

== Variations ==
Due to the flexible nature of spleef, the game mode can be altered in many ways. A common variation is to create multiple levels of playing fields, and upon losing on one arena, you descend to the next. A common theme among variations is incorporating gameplay elements such as [[fire]], [[explosion]]s, or [[mob]]s. Some versions allow someone to destroy blocks from under the players, and others incorporate challenges such as not allowing players to jump. As stated in the rules above, hitting other players may occasionally be allowed as well.

Instead of having to break down blocks manually, players may be given items that have the special ability to shoot projectiles. When the projectile hits a block, the block disappears. When players are on separate islands, they can still shoot those projectiles in order to cause other players to fall.
