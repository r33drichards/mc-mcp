'''''Blackout''''' is a puzzle action game created by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Blockjam Bundle]] game jam.

== Gameplay ==

The player is tasked with escaping a mental asylum by completing multiple levels. On their way there stand lethal, often unavoidable obstactles, in the form of electrocution traps and pill-shooting guards. Each time the player is killed ("blacked out"), they respawn, along with shadows of all their past lives. Those shadows are able to interact with the environment, triggering traps and distracting guards. By doing multiple runs, the level can finally be made possible or easier to win.
