== Trivia ==

* Similar to Steve's beard being confused for a smile, many players mistake Sunny's hair for a hat, such as a beanie.
** By extension, it is also commonly called a bowler cut, which wasn't the intention.<ref>{{Cite Discord|url=https://discord.com/Channels/321736665058115604/1025258935663480863/1032210729224376340|title=Its like those asian hair styles<br>Not exactly a bowl cut actually<br>Like this|channel=Minecraft|server=MC Idea Academy|invite=https://discord.gg/mcideasacademy|user=Uhhh|date=October 19, 2022}}</ref> Despite this, it is referred to as one in the character creator.
* Of all nine default skins, Sunny is [[Jasper Boerstra]]'s personal favorite.<ref>{{YouTube link|qIrmhRHuW08|The History of Minecraft Skins|Minecraft|November 30, 2022}}</ref>
* Although not usable in the map itself, Sunny and Noor are used to promote the map [[Trial Chamber Legends]].<ref>{{Mcnet|the-summer-celebration-returns|The Summer Celebration returns|July 2, 2024|Linn Viberg}}</ref>
* Despite there being an arm category, Sunny's prosthetic is actually a part of their base in Bedrock Edition.
* In a [[Minecraft Monthly]] video announcing the [[Beyond the Pale Garden]] event, Sunny can briefly be seen without their overalls, before suddenly regaining them. This is due to the fact that they are wearing different pants instead of their normal overalls.<ref>{{YouTube link|u63KYFsNC44|NEWEST GAME DROP! + LIVE EVENT IN MINECRAFT? {{!}} MINECRAFT MONTHLY|Minecraft|December 4, 2024}}</ref>
* In multiple [[Mojang shorts|YouTube shorts]], Sunny is usually depicted having a masculine voice.<ref>{{ytl|Qta0Lc3wimM|FRIEND WITH TOO MUCH FREE TIME|Minecraft|December 23, 2024}}</ref>
* Prior to Sunny's introduction, the character {{MCD|Greta}} in {{MCD}} also had a prosthetic arm, designed as an intentional connection between the two.<ref>{{Cite Discord|url=https://discord.com/channels/321736665058115604/424021395601620993/1031975987468046457|user=Uhhh|invite=https://discord.gg/UejgrBn|server=MC Ideas Academy|channel=minecraft|title=Yep, no one noticed though 😦|date=October 18, 2022}}</ref>
