'''Beta 1.21.100.23''' (ChromeOS, Android) or '''Preview 1.21.100.23''' (Windows, iOS, iPadOS, Xbox, PlayStation) is the fourth beta/''Preview'' version for [[Bedrock Edition 1.21.100]], released on July 1, 2025,<ref>{{cite|url=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/37741189879821-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-100-23|title=Minecraft Beta & Preview - 1.21.100.23|website=Minecraft Feedback|date=July 1, 2025}}</ref> which fixes some bugs. It also adds [[copper golem]]s, [[copper chest]]s, [[copper tools]] and [[copper armor]], as part of the "Drop 3 2025" [[experiment]]. <!--I was trying to word it like this, but it just sounds too wordy: It is also the first preview to add content for "Drop 3 2025", under an experiment with the same name, which includes [[copper golem]]s, [[copper chest]]s and copper tools and armor.-->

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''[[Flat]] world presets'''
*Added "The Void" as a flat world preset.

== Changes ==
=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Hotbar]]'''
*Hotbar can always be hit in any touch device. The detection area matches the texture even if you have customise controls enabled.

'''[[Leash]]ed mobs'''
*Updated the way leashed mobs interact with [[Riding|vehicles]].
**Leashed mobs can now be pulled into [[boat]]s, [[minecart]]s, and other rideable entities if the leash is slackened when close to those entities.
**Leashed mobs will now automatically dismount their vehicle if the leash is stretched far enough.

=== General ===
'''[[UI]]'''
*Made some adjustments to the spacing of items in the settings menu.

=== Technical ===
'''[[Add-on]]s and Script Engine'''
*Biomes client settings now look up settings based on the biome's full name, including its namespace. Vanilla biomes will fall back on their name without a namespace if an exact match is not found before falling back on default settings (for example, {{cd|minecraft:plains}} will match itself, then {{cd|plains}} if no setting was found)

'''[[API]]'''
*Added new error class {{cd|UnsupportedFunctionalityError}} which is thrown for certain cases where a particular functionality such as a method, or part of a method based on the parameters, is not supported. An example is calling the {{cd|Entity}} method {{cd|remove}} on a player.
*Added new error class {{cd|EntitySpawnError}} which is thrown when an entity fails to spawn via the {{cd|spawnEntity}} method on {{cd|Dimension}}.
*Updated many methods to throw custom errors to provide better context and information of the problem that occurred.

'''[[Block]]s'''
*Blocks with improperly configured textures will now show additional content errors.
*Released the particle count field for the block destruction particles component out of experimental.

== Experimental ==
These additions and changes are accessible by enabling the "Beta APIs", and "[[Drop 3 2025]]" [[experimental]] toggles.

=== Additions ===
==== Blocks ====
'''[[Copper Chest]]'''
*Copper chest is a new type of chest that has waxed and oxidized variants.
*Copper chests oxidize over time and can be waxed like other copper blocks.
*Copper chests can be crafted using a chest and copper ingots.

==== Items ====
'''[[Copper Armor]]'''
*Added [[copper helmet]]s, [[copper chestplate]]s, [[copper leggings]], and [[copper boots]].
**Copper armor has higher durability than leather but less than iron. Copper armor enchantability sits slightly lower than with iron.

'''[[Copper Nugget]]'''
*Added copper nuggets.
**Copper equipment turns into copper nuggets when smelted.
*Copper nuggets can be crafted by using a copper ingot.
{{crafting
|B2 = Copper Ingot
|Output = Copper Nugget,9
|ignoreusage=1
}}

'''[[Copper Tools]]'''
*Added [[copper axe]]s, [[copper hoe]]s, [[copper pickaxe]]s, [[copper shovel]]s, and [[copper sword]]s.
**Copper tools and weapons are crafted and repaired using copper ingots. They do the same amount of damage as stone but have higher durability. Copper tools work faster than stone tools, but they are slower than their iron counterparts. Copper tools have higher enchantability than diamond, but slightly less than iron.

'''[[File:Copper_Golem_Spawn_Egg_JE1_BE1.png|class=pixel-image|width=32x32]] [[Copper Golem Spawn Egg]]'''
* Used to spawn a [[copper golem]].

==== Mobs ====
'''[[Copper Golem]]'''
*Drops 1 to 3 [[copper ingot]]s when killed.
*It can help with sorting items into chests.
*If it is not holding an item, it will look for a nearby [[copper chest]]s and pick up items from that chest.
*It can pick up max 16 items in a stack at the time.
*Any item in a copper chest can be picked up.
*If it is holding an item, it will look for nearby wooden [[chest]]s to try to place the item into.
*It can only place an item in a chest if the chest is empty or contains the same type of item the golem is holding in its hand.
*It will visit a max of 10 copper chests when looking for items to pick up, and a max of 10 chests when looking for somewhere to put the items.
*If no matching chest is found the copper golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again.
*The search area for chests from the copper golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks.

==== Technical ====
'''AI Goals'''
*Added the {{cd|minecraft:behavior.transport_items}} AI goal, allows a mob to transport items from and to containers.
**Description:
***If the mob is not carrying an item it will try to find a container matching {{cd|source_container_types}} and will attempt to take an item from the first non-empty slot. It will take the largest of {{cd|max_stack_size}} and the size of the stack in that slot. If the container is empty or it does not find a match it will remember this container as visited and search for the next container from which to pick up an item. If it fails to find an unvisited container from which to pick up items it will disable the goal for {{cd|idle_cooldown}} seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has picked up an item it resets what containers it has visited.
***If the mob is carrying an item it will try to find a container matching {{cd|destination_container_types}} and attempt to put its carried item in it. It will put as much of the carried item as possible into the container. If it is still carrying an item (the container is full) it will remember the container as visited and try to find the next container to put items in. If it fails to find an unvisited container in which to put items it will disable the goal for {{cd|idle_cooldown}} seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has stored items and is empty handed again it resets what containers it has visited.
***If at any point the target container becomes an invalid target (the block could be removed or a chest could have a cat sit on it for example), the mob will mark the position as visited and move to the next target.
**Fields:
***{{cd|source_container_types}}: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to get items from. Default is any container.
***{{cd|destination_container_types}}: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to put items in. Default is any container.
***{{cd|max_stack_size}}: The maximum stack size that the mob will try to take from a container. Default is 16.
***{{cd|interaction_time}}: The amount of time spent interacting with the containers in seconds. Default is 3.0.
***{{cd|allow_simultaneous_interaction}}: Whether the entity is allowed to simultaneously interact with a container that another non-player entity is already interacting with. Default is {{cd|false}}.
***{{cd|search_strategy}}: Whether to select the nearest valid container or a random valid container in range. valid values are {{cd|nearest}} or {{cd|random}} (default).
***{{cd|search_distance}}: The maximum horizontal and vertical distance at which to find containers for taking or placing items. Default {{cd|[62, 32]}}.
***{{cd|max_visited_containers}}: The maximum number of containers the mob will visit before resetting. 0 is unlimited and default is 16.
***{{cd|initial_cooldown}}: Time, in seconds, the mob will wait after spawning or after its available goals have changed (e.g. due to a component group update). Default is 0.
***{{cd|idle_cooldown}}: When the mob cannot find a valid container to interact with, the goal will be disabled for this amount of time in seconds. Default is 20.
***{{cd|place_strategy}}: governs which container contents the goal is allowed to add to:
****{{cd|with_matching}}: Only allows placing item in a container already having stack(s) of item.
****{{cd|with_matching_or_empty}}: Like the above, but additionally allows placement in empty containers.
****{{cd|any}}: Puts no restriction, allows placement of item in container as long as there is space. This is the default behavior.
***{{cd|allowed_items}}: A list of item descriptors that are the only items the mob is allowed to transport. If non-empty {{cd|disallowed_items}} must be empty. Default is {{cd|empty}} (all items allowed).
***{{cd|disallowed_items}}: A list of item descriptors that are the mob is not allowed to transport. If non-empty {{cd|allowed_items}} must be empty. Default is {{cd|empty}} (no items disallowed).
**Requirements and limitations:
***Initially the component requires the 2025 Drop 3 experiment to be enabled but it will be generally available in a later update.
***A navigation component is needed to enable the mob to navigate to the container. E.g. {{cd|minecraft:navigation.walk}}
***At the moment chests, copper chests, barrels, and shulker boxes are the only supported containers.

'''API'''
*Added {{cd|setFov}} with {{cd|CameraFovOptions}} parameter. This can be used to modify the FOV of the current camera.
**Added class {{cd|LootTableManager}} to {{cd|beta}}, which allows for generation of loot from entities and blocks.
*Added easing options for clearing a custom FOV. Clearing without valid easing values will instantly clear the custom FOV value.

=== Changes ===
==== Technical ====
'''API'''
*Moved type {{cd|EntityHungerComponent}}, {{cd|EntitySaturationComponent}}, {{cd|EntityExhaustionComponent}} from {{cd|beta}} into {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Moved {{cd|EntityEquippableComponent}} properties {{cd|totalArmor}} and {{cd|totalToughnes}}s from {{cd|beta}} into {{cd|2.1.0}}.
*Class {{cd|ModalFormDataTextFieldOptions}}.
**Field {{cd|defaultValue}} type changed from {{cd|string}} to {{cd|minecraftserver.RawMessage | string}}.
