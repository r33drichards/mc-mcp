{{Missing information|the JSON format, which is likely outdated for the latest launcher}}
'''launcher_profiles.json''' ('''launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json''' for the Minecraft Launcher installed from Microsoft Store) is a [[JSON]] file located in [[.minecraft]], which contains all of the [[Minecraft Launcher]]'s settings, profiles, selected user/profile as well as the cached user information (email, access token, etc.). This file allows flexible updating from older launcher versions to newer builds and vice versa, without having to worry about things like profiles and login session getting lost.
