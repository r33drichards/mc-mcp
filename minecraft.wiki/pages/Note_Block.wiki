A '''note block''' is a [[block]] that emits sounds when {{Control|attacked}}, {{Control|used}}, or [[powered]]. The sound produced can be altered in various ways by using it or putting certain blocks directly above or below it. [[Allay]]s are affected by note blocks, staying nearby and dropping held items next to it for a short while upon hearing its sound.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Note blocks are most quickly broken with an [[axe]].

Note blocks can generate in [[ancient cities]].

==== Notes ====
[[File:Note-Block.png|thumb|right|upright|A note block being triggered and playing a note.]]

A note block will produce a sound and spawn a colored musical note [[particle]] whenever any of the following conditions are met: 

* It is {{Control|attack|text=attacked}} by a [[player]] in [[Survival mode]]
* It receives a [[redstone signal]]
* It is {{Control|use|text=used}} by a player. {{Control|use|text=Using}} a note block also changes its pitch.

A note block must have either [[air]] or a [[mob head]] in the space directly above it to play a sound, though {{Control|use|text=using}} a silenced note block will still change its pitch. Note block sounds can be heard from up to 48 blocks away, and can be independently controlled by the [[Jukebox]]/Note Blocks slider in the audio [[settings]].

Each time a note block plays a sound, a note [[particle]] will appear from the top. The color of the particle depends on the pitch of the note block. Note particles do not appear for silenced note blocks or mob head instruments.

Excluding mob heads, there are 16 different instruments and 25 different pitches per instrument (a total of 400 notes with different sounds). {{control|use|text=Using}} a note block increases the instrument's pitch up a [[Wikipedia:Semitone|semitone]], with a total of two full [[Wikipedia:Octave|octaves]] (24 semitones in total) being available for each instrument. The standard range (for harp and pling instruments) of notes span from F♯<sub>3</sub> to F♯<sub>5</sub>. After reaching the highest note (24 presses of the {{control|use|text=use button}}), pressing use again (25th press of the {{control|use|text=use button}}) resets the pitch back to F♯<sub>3</sub>, as does breaking the block. The note block's pitch is ignored for [[Player Head|player heads]] and the six [[mob heads]].

The string bass and didgeridoo are two octaves (24 semitones) lower than the standard range, the guitar is one octave (12 semitones) lower than the standard range, the flute is one octave above the standard range, and the bell, chime, and xylophone are 2 octaves above the standard range. This gives six octaves (72 semitones) of effective range to combine instruments for greater pitch coverage.

The exact pitch can be found from its {{control|use}}-count by using the following formula: <code>2 ^ ((use count - 12) / 12)</code>.

The exact pitch to {{control|use}}-count assignment is shown below,<ref>[http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1020&t=136347 Original chart by cookingfat]</ref><ref>[http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/resource-pack-discussion/1255570 Original /playsound pitch chart by kwerti]</ref> along with the note's color, which is rendered with shading using the particle's texture.

Alternatively, there is a graphical version available:
[[File:Noteblock reference.png|class=pixel-image]]

The current pitch of a note block can be roughly estimated by {{Control|attack|text=attacking}} it and looking at the color of the note particle.
[[File:Note colors.png|class=pixel-image]]

{{IN|java}}, the tuning can also be checked by looking at the [[debug screen]] (accessed by pressing {{key|F3}}). It is denoted as "note:" followed by a number from 0 to 24.

==== Instruments ====
The instrument played depends on the block placed directly underneath the note block. Mob heads must instead be placed on top of the note block. 

Mob head instruments take priority over block instruments, and play the corresponding mob's {{cd|ambient}} sound, except for creeper heads, which instead trigger the {{cd|primed}} sound. Mob head sounds are not affected by the note block's pitch.

==== Activating note blocks ====
[[File:NoteBlockRedstone.png|thumb|A pair of note blocks wired to a [[clock circuit]] to play alternately.]]

Note blocks can be activated in a variety of different ways following normal redstone principles. Note blocks [[conductive block|conduct]] redstone power, which means they activate blocks next to them when directly powered, including other note blocks. 

{{IN|je}} after activating the note block, or changing the note block's pitch (via {{control|use}}) is treated as a block state change, which successfully generates a block update and plays a sound after a [[Piston/Usage#Start delay|start delay]]. This update is detectable by both [[observer]]s and traditional piston-based [[block update detector]]s (BUDs).

{{IN|je}}, an [[observer]] facing a note block will trigger whenever the note block is {{Control|use|text=used}}, activated with redstone power or the note block's instrument changes. This makes note blocks very flexible when used with observers, especially since note blocks can conduct power to other redstone devices. They can serve as activation switches or a means to control how and when observers are triggered in circuits. 

{{IN|be}}, the musical pitch and instrument data are handled on a separate process (tile entity data) that is independent of the main world update loop. As a result, right-clicking to change the note does not trigger a block update. Because no update signal is generated, neither [[observer]]s nor [[BUD]]s can detect the change. This is a known bug.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-53919}}</ref>

==== Sculk detection ====
[[Sculk sensors]] and [[calibrated sculk sensors]] can detect both note block activations and pitch changes because these actions generate vibration events. {{IN|be}}, sculk sensors provide the only reliable method to detect both note block activations and pitch changes for redstone, since observers and BUDs cannot register these events.

==== Interaction with allays ====
If an [[allay]] hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location, it tries to pathfind to it. It will then spend 30 seconds near that particular note block, seeking items around it and dropping them near the note block instead of its player. After 30 seconds, the allay returns to targeting its player unless the note block is played again. A [[Particles#vibration|vibration particle]] emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing [[wool]] between the note block and the allay can prevent this [[Sculk Sensor#Vibration detection|interaction]]. Allays ignore note blocks which do not make sounds, with the exception of note blocks with [[Player Head|player heads]] on top.

=== Fuel ===
Note blocks can be used as [[fuel]] in [[furnace]]s, smelting 1.5 items per block.

== Trivia ==
* Because a note block is a wooden-type block, a note block directly on top of another one produces a string bass sound when playing notes.
* {{IN|java}}, note blocks have the second highest number of possible block state combinations, at 1150, beating [[fire]]'s 512 and behind [[redstone dust]]'s 1296.
