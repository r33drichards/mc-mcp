=== Harvesting ===
Mushroom stew can be obtained by “milking” a [[mooshroom]] with an empty [[bowl]]. This is accomplished by {{Control|using}} a bowl on a mooshroom. The bowl gets replaced by the mushroom stew item. There is no cooldown for doing so.

If a stack of more than one bowl is used on a mooshroom, only one bowl is consumed, and the mushroom stew goes into an empty inventory slot, or is dropped if the player's inventory is full.

== Usage ==
=== Food ===
{{see also|Tutorial:Hunger management|title1=Hunger management}}
To eat mushroom stew, press and hold {{control|use}} while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores {{hunger|6}} [[hunger]] and 7.2 hunger [[Hunger#Mechanics|saturation]].

The bowl is returned to the player empty after the mushroom stew has been eaten, and can be reused to craft more, similarly to [[Rabbit Stew|rabbit stew]] and [[Beetroot Soup|beetroot soup]].
