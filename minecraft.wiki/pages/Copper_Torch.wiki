A '''copper torch''' is a non-solid block that emits light. Copper torches can also be used to craft [[copper lantern]]s.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Copper torches can be [[instant mining|broken instantly]] using anything, and drop themselves as an item.
{{breaking row|Copper Torch|horizontal=1}}
A copper torch is removed and drops itself as an item if:
*Its attachment block is moved, removed, or destroyed
*[[Water]] or [[lava]] flows into its space
*A [[piston]] pushes it or moves a block into its space

=== Crafting ===
{{Crafting
|B1= Copper Nugget
|B2= Coal; Charcoal
|B3= Stick
|Output= Copper Torch, 4
|type= Decoration block
|foot=1}}

== Usage ==
Copper torches can be placed on the top or the sides of most solid blocks, although some blocks require {{control|sneaking}}. Being non-solid, copper torches have no collision box. More information about placement can be found at [[Opacity/Placement]].

Gravity-affected blocks like [[sand]] and [[gravel]] do not start falling if the space immediately beneath is occupied by a copper torch. Falling blocks break if they fall onto a solid block with a copper torch above it. If there is an [[air]] block under the copper torch, the falling blocks fall through the copper torch onto the surface below.<ref>{{bug|MC-3262|||WAI}}</ref>

Copper torches do not [[oxidize]]. The copper is being used as part of the torch's fuel and not the base.

=== Light ===
Copper torches give off a light level of 14. Copper torches also melt [[snow layer]]s within 2 blocks and [[ice]] within 3 blocks ([[taxicab distance]]).

When the [[Render Dragon Features for Creators]] experiment is enabled in ''[[Minecraft Preview]]'', the top part of copper torches emits colored [[Vibrant Visuals#Point lighting|point lighting]] with {{Color|#86ca59}}. This causes the bottom part of the copper torch to render a small square shadow.

== Issues ==
{{Issue list}}

== Trivia ==
* In real life, green fire can be produced by introducing copper(II) salts such as {{w|copper(II) sulfate}} and {{w|copper(II) chloride}} into a flame, in a process called {{w|flame test}}.
** Copper in its metal form does not reliably work for this purpose, as the flame color is produced by metal ions.
