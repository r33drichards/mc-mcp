'''Bedrock Editor v0.6.2''' is a minor alpha release for the [[Bedrock Editor]] released on April 24, 2024, which fixes bugs.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor/discussions/173</ref><ref>https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/26100457790093-Minecraft-Beta-Preview-1-21-0-23#h_01HW8AJJBBG813TVNNXY4NP1NN</ref>

== Fixes ==
* Selection volumes can no longer be created when they would exceed the world height limits.
* When filling up a volume and dragging the volume during the filling operation the filling volume would also change. Now the filling operation happens in the original volume.
* Fixed a bug where camera collision caused third-person view to display inside the player's head in Crosshair mode.
