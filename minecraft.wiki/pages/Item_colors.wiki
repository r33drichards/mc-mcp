{{wip}} 
The following page lists [[color]]s that are applied to [[item]]s in the game.

There are many colors in ''Minecraft'' as players can see by looking at blocks or mobs. But by dyeing leather armor, players can get unique colors as there are 12,326,391 different possible colors.

== Both editions ==
=== Spawn eggs ===
{{main|Spawn Egg colors}}

=== Potions ===
{{main|Effect colors}}

=== Item forms of colored blocks ===
The inventory color of the grass is calculated with {{cd|temperature:0.5}} and {{cd|rainfall:1.0}}. The result is {{cd|AdjTemp:0.5, AdjRainfall:0.5}}, We can get the color ({{color|#7CBD6B}}) for the middle of center (x: 127, y: 127) of the {{cd|grass.png}}.

These are exclusive to ''Java Edition''; ''Bedrock Edition'' instead has pre-colored textures used for items, distinct from the textures actually used for blocks in placed form (see [[Bedrock Edition history of textures/Items]]).

=== Maps ===
{{IN|java}}, the item icons for [[Map|filled]] and [[explorer map]]s use two different textures: <code>filled_map.png</code>, which is the base texture, and <code>filled_map_markings.png</code>, which is overlaid onto the base texture and colored differently depending on the type of map. The color is defined in the <code>minecraft:map_color</code> component as an integer; if not defined, it defaults to {{color|#46402E}} (dec: 4603950).

* {{ItemLink|Map|Filled Map}}: {{color|#46402E}} (dec: 4603950)
* {{ItemLink|Buried Treasure Map}}: {{color|#46402E}} (dec: 4603950)
* {{ItemLink|Woodland Explorer Map}}: {{color|#524C44}} (dec: 5393476)
* {{ItemLink|Ocean Explorer Map}}: {{color|#3A7265}} (dec: 3830373)
* {{ItemLink|Trial Explorer Map}}: {{color|#C26B4C}} (dec: 12741452)
* {{ItemLink|Plains Village Map|Village Maps; Jungle Explorer Map; Swamp Explorer Map}}: {{color|#999999}} (dec: 10066329)

{{IN|bedrock}}, pre-colored textures are instead used for each map type.

=== Dyed leather armor ===
[[File:DyeGraph3.png|thumb|Leather armor color codes]]
{{main|Dye#Color_values}}

The default color is {{color|#A06540}} (Dec: 10511680). This is used for leather horse armor, and leather helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots.

=== Firework stars ===
{{main|Dye#Color_values}}

The default color is {{color|#8A8A8A}} (Dec: 9079434). When dyes are applied, the final color is different from that used for leather armor. They do not match one to one.
