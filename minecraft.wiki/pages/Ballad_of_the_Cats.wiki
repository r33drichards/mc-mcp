{{C418 agreement}}
[[File:Ballad of the Cats.ogg]]

"Ballad of the Cats" is a very heavy piece with a low-pitched piano part that keeps the pulse throughout, blended with dire-sounding string chords and occasional synthesizers. The track begins with a period of techno-sounding music and then a break. Later, there is a second period of peaceful music and then a techno-style ending. Near the beginning and end are distant, echoing ghast sounds.
