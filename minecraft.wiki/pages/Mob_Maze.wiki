}}'''Mob Maze''' is a {{w|roguelike}} [[server]] for {{BE}} created by [[Gamemode One]]. It is a [[featured server]].<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mob-maze|title=Mob Maze|author=Staff|website=Minecraft.net|date=12/16/25}}</ref>

== Summary ==
=== The Plot ===
Upon entering the server, the player is put into a small, 3x3 tube of glitchy-appearing blocks, with, at the end of the tunnel, the Mob Maze logo pointed towards the player. Leaving the tube, the player is thrust into a tutorial with The Host, a robot character wearing a suit and a top hat. Ahead of the spawn is the entrance to the maze.
To the left of the spawn is a shop where the player can buy costumes, VIP, titles, glyphs, and pets using Cubits and [[minecoin]]s.
Various Taters are roaming the map that you can talk to. Glitch chests are also scattered throughout the map, which grant 150 Cubits when opened.
To the right of the spawn is a forge containing a toolsmith. Not far is a Ninja NPC named KU, who will offer the player a parkour challenge. After completing the parkour, the player will reach the roof of the forge, where a glitch chest containing 150 Cubits can be found. In a mine in the Plot, there is hard parkour, with a Ninja NPC named RO. Beat it will go to the hardest parkour, the "EXTREME DEADLY PARKOUR" called in-game by another Ninja NPC called DA.
Further to the left of spawn is an empty chunk with an NPC in front of it. Speaking to that NPC allows the player to play a minigame. In the minigame, the player has 20 seconds to reach the exit of a small parkour challenge. There are 10 rounds, each with a layout randomly chosen from a pool, and the player has 3 lives. Playing the minigame rewards cubits based on the number of rounds completed.

=== Lab ===
To the right of the labyrinth entrance is a laboratory where various NPCs sell abilities:
*Slime Bounce - 12000 Cubits
**When activated, allows the player to jump higher than normal (about the height of a giant block) for a few seconds.
*Shield Totem - 12000 Cubits
**When activated, the player does not receive damage from spikes and magma for a few seconds.
*Swift Boot - 6000 Cubits
**When activated, it speeds up the player for a few seconds.
*X-Ray Hack - 1500 Cubits
**When activated, allows the player to see chests, pots, pressure plates, and doors through walls for a few seconds.
Every ability has a cooldown.
Near these NPCs are small labyrinths where player can test these abilities. Abilities can be upgraded and additional slots for new abilities can be purchased using Cubits.

=== Maze ===
Before the maze run begins, players wait in the lobby until 10 players join, then for about 30 seconds, during which time you can take abilities if they are unlocked, and after which the gates open and the run begins. The maze maps change every day.

'''Deprecated maze maps:'''
*Crafty Challenges
*Forbidden Fortress
*Chambers of Chaos
*Maze of the Many
*Maze of Mysteries
*Powder Keg
*Redstone Riddles
*Shattered Stronghold
*Tunnels of Terror
*The Broken Monument

'''Maze maps:'''
*Crafty Trials
*Forsaken Fortress
*Halls of Havoc
*Maze of the Masses
*Maze of Mastery
*Creeper Keg
*Redstone Run
*Splintered Stronghold
*Terrifying Tunnels
*The Broken Monolith

Chests and pots are scattered throughout the map. Chests can drop coal, iron, gold, and diamonds. Cookie jars can also be found, dropping a cookie when broken. There are several types of chests: regular, green, blue, and purple. Regular and green chests are scattered throughout the map, while blue and purple ones are found only in specific locations. Two golden shulker boxes can also be found within the map, giving more resources than chests, and give a yellow object as the last item. Some chests are locked, requiring several players to stand on a pressure plate in front of it before it can be opened. Sometimes chests are hidden behind a wall, and to open the way to them, several players need to stand on a nearby pressure plate. Chests and pots can be seen through walls from a distance using the X-Ray ability. The higher the chest, the larger and better the rewards it drops, and the more times it must be hit to open it. There are also three types of pots: large, small and cookie jars. Pots are low in resources and usually drop coal and iron, but cookie jars drop cookies, which, when eaten, can restore 2 hearts ({{hp|4}}.

Spikes are scattered throughout the map, dealing 1 damage when you step on them. There can be large pistons located near the spikes that cyclically extend and retract, which can knock the player onto the spikes and cause damage. When the piston is extended, its retractable portion can be jumped over. If the piston retracts while the player is between the head and the block, the player will take damage. Occasionally, there are areas with lava and magma blocks. Unlike in the original game, if the player adopts a sneaking stance, the player will continue to take damage from the magma. The map features green paths where giant zombies walk and special rooms with giant creepers.

When completing a maze, the collected loot, doors opened, puzzle steps completed, secrets found, and escape bonus are totaled, and Cubits and ability XP are awarded. Upon death, progress is not lost, and the player still receives Cubits and ability XP, but in smaller quantities since there will be no escape bonus.
==== Challenges ====
The maze has 5 puzzle rooms: two after start, one after 2 normal chests facing each other (always pressure plates; also marks the halfway point), and two more after that.
Puzzle rooms can have one of four challenges:

'''Complete the monument:'''

Three to eight empty wool slots are located near the center of the room. Players need to find one of each wool color from dispensers in the room somewhere, and move it to its empty slot.

'''Complete the crafting recipe:'''

A crafting grid is located near the center of the room, displaying the target recipe above it. Players will need to find the required blocks for the recipe in nearby dispensers, and move them to the correct slots of the crafting grid. 

'''Find the pressure plates:'''

Multiple pressure plates are located around the room. Players will need to press all the pressure plates to open the door.

'''Find the correct path:'''

The room is filled with checkered tiles. When stepped on by a player, they will either turn purple to indicate the correct path, or disappear and cause the player to fall through the floor. The path forward will be opened when at least 2 players step on each of the side pressure plates of the door.

Outside of puzzle rooms, locked doors can be found often, requiring one or more players to find a nearby pressure plate to open the door.

'''Danger! Evacuate!'''

This occurs when the Miasma reaches the section of the maze that the player is in. The player's hearts will turn pink or white ([[file:MM Miasma heart.png]]), and the player will begin to slowly take damage. Players in the Miasma will need to quickly reach the next section of the maze in order to survive.

==== Secrets ====
Hidden chests can commonly be found in the maze, coming in a few forms. Some chests can be found hidden behind a fake block, which will disappear when the player moves near it. Some chests can be found hidden in a wall, requiring multiple players to press a nearby pressure plate to reveal them. Chests can also be found on the other side of an impossible jump, such as a large spike pit or a high jump, requiring the player to use a specific ability to reach it.

== Trivia ==
* The Speed ability is similar the {{MCD|Boots of Swiftness}} from {{MCD}}.
**The Shield boost is a reference to the {{MCD|Totem of Shielding}} in the same game.
** Also, Tater, who is standing in the lab next to the Speed ​​ability, has a suit that makes him look like the {{AMCM|Super Iron Golem}} from {{AMCM}}.
* There is a Mob Maze thread on the official ''Minecraft'' Discord server.
