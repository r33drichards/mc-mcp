{{Infobox video|image=10things mc village&pillage.jpg|length=4:56|date=April 30, 2019}}{{YouTube|EbPrkqn9PMA}}

==== Summary ====
The video begins inside of a broom closet for the first time, as M.A.R.I.L.L.A. boots up in the wake of a door closing. Introducing herself as "Mojang's favorite piece of obsolete hardware," she establishes that she's long out of use, and segues into a list of ten trivia facts on [[Village & Pillage]]. The tenth fact is the introduction of [[panda]]s to the game, highlighting an issue wherein pandas startled by sneezing would become stuck in midair. This culminates in a gag of the cover for [[Xbox 360 Edition]] being changed to include a warning prohibiting players from touching the game if they have a common cold. A panda then sneezes again, corrupting the footage.

The ninth fact is about [[cat]]s, joking about how they tend to spawn inside of [[Village|libraries]] and are perceived to flee. This culminates in a joke list of books to add to the game, so they can "appeal" to the cats.<ref group="note">This includes ''Nineteen Eighty-Paw'', ''The Great Catsby'', ''To Kill a Mockingbird AND THEN BURY IT IN THE NEIGHBOUR'S GARDEN'', ''The Handmaid's Tail'', ''The Cat-Cher in the Rye'', ''Eat, Purr, Love'', ''Napping in Leaves of Grass'', ''Cat 22'', and ''Cats: The Script of the Hit Musical - It Makes Great Kitty Litter!''</ref> The eight fact is about another glitch, highlighting an issue where baby [[villager]]s would lose their heads thanks to complications with the profession overlays. Similarly, the seventh fact is about the "fox box," a corruption of the [[fox]] model, which M.A.R.I.L.L.A. calls nightmare fuel and proceeds to make puns about. From there M.A.R.I.L.L.A. explains that the introduction of "attics" to the [[Village|forge]] building allowed for [[monster]]s to spawn, expressing gratitude for there not being any hostile mobs in the real world.

The fifth fact touches on villagers utilizing [[bed]]s, joking that they are suffering from insomnia due to sporadic head movements, and at one point another decapitation glitch. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. then takes a pot shot at [[phantom]]s, before sneezing herself. The fourth fact touches on the worldbuilding exercised by the village redesigns, where they're made entirely out of local materials such as [[sandstone]] and the colors of beds. The third fact is about [[pillager]]s, highlighting their [[Dungeons:Pillager|appearance]] in {{MCD}}. She refers to them in unkind terms, and credits their conception to [[Jens Bergensten]]. The penultimate fact touches on the sound design of the horn used at the start of [[raid]]s. She said it was designed to be easy to understand but also to feel "odd", in order to match the "unique characteristics" of the pillagers. The final fact touches on villagers without an associated village, particularly those that can spawn in [[swamp]]s, which M.A.R.I.L.L.A. finds to be cute.

Hello! My name is [OLD MODEM SOUND] and I'm Mojang's favourite piece of obsolete hardware!
At least, that's what they told me when they dumped me in here! Anyway, here's 10
things you didn't know about Village and Pillage.


[TEN]

We added pandas to Minecraft!
They're so happy to be part of the game, that they're dancing! Umm... in the sky. This
glorious glitch occurred because adult pandas were developed to jump up when
baby panda sneeze. Problem is, they didn't really come back down again...
But just don't sneeze around pandas and they'll be fine. In fact, we're just gonna
change the Minecraft box art from this,
to this. Problem solved!

[NINE]

In desert villages, sometimes cats spawn in libraries,
but then they immediately run away. [MEOW] Clearly
the problem here is that the libraries don't offer books that appeal directly
to cats. [MEOW] So developers, add these to the next Minecraft update please:
[CHEESY MUSIC]

[EIGHT]

See anything wrong with this picture?
When the developers added the profession textures,
for no reason the babies' head's disappeared! But come on, who really
needs a head anyway? I don't have a head and I'm great, right? ... Please like and subscribe.

[SEVEN]

Awww, aren't foxes cute? My heart would be melting
right now - if I had one. But when we first made foxes for the game they turned out
like this.
Not so much a cute fox, as a nightmare-fuel of a box. This is a totally
understandable mistake. After all, the word "fox" and the word "box", rhyme. Here's a
list of other potential rhyming-based errors I've calculated together.
[MORE CHEESY MUSIC]
Hey that last one sounds fun!

[SIX]

When we were designing new buildings, we decided
to add attics. Unfortunately, dark attics inadvertently
became a popular hangout spot for monstrous hostile mobs. Phew! Good thing
there are no hostile mobs in here. Probably.

[FIVE]

When we gave villagers the ability to use beds, we must have accidentally typed "insomnia for the win"
into the game's code, because the villagers just wouldn't get along with
their beds. They'd shift around, talk in their sleep and... oh no, please don't start
losing your heads again! I simply can't understand why the villagers would have
trouble getting a good night's sleep. It's not like Minecraft has anything
that punishes you for not sleeping --
[HORRIBLE PHANTOM NOISE]
Ooh, sorry about that. Must have a virus.

[FOUR]

Don't the new villages look nice? I think they look fantastic,
and I'm not just saying that because I've had nothing to look at but the
inside of a broom closet for almost two decades [WIND SOUND]. All the new villages are built
using materials from the biome they're in, right down to the colours used to dye
the bedsheets. See?
Oh, is this really the only clip of the bedsheets I have?

[THREE]

Recognise this fellow? It's a Pillager, and it's a real charmer.
I'm only joking, it's a total jerk.
JERK ALERT
They're in our upcoming game, Minecraft: Dungeons, and now they're being added to Minecraft!
It's a concept from Lead Creative Designer Jens Bergensten.

[TWO]

[RAID HORN SOUND]
Hear that war horn? That's the sound of trouble.
The sound needed to be somewhat unusual to match the Pillagers' unusual
characteristics. Special, but also easily recognised as an alarm. For example,
Currently you are not alarmed. But now...
[RAID HORN SOUND]

[ONE]

Has it always been your dream to live in a swamp? Mine too!
And with the Village & Pillage update, Mojang is about to make both our
disgusting dreams come true. See, if you build a village in a swamp,
you'll get special swamp villagers! Just look at them! A bit like a sneezing kitten,
they're both gross, and adorable.
Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you
next month for 10 things you didn't know about don't [MODEM SOUND]. Don't forget to like and subscribe,
and to pick up Minecraft at your local games emporium.

=== The Last Ten Years ===
{{Infobox video|length=5:16|date=May 31, 2019|image=10things mc last10yrs.jpg}}{{YouTube|sriHoJkuDUw}}
==== Summary ====
M.A.R.I.L.L.A., having apparently been trapped inside of a closet for ten years, decides to list off ten pieces of trivia for the [[10th anniversary]] of ''Minecraft''. The first piece of trivia is that the game "almost never existed!", meaning it had several precursors, such as [[RubyDung]]. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. finds this name preferable, and creates a list of other names that she feels would have been more profitable.<ref group="note">These include ''Craftmine'', ''Minecraft: Battle Royale'', [[Cave game tech test|Cave Game]], ''Fifty Shades of [[Clay]]'', ''Buy This Game and You'll Never Feel Sadness Again!!!'', ''{{Wikipedia|Avengers: Endgame}}'', and Jeff.</ref> The second piece discusses the introduction of [[crafting]] to the game in 2010, and then discusses [[MATTIS]], the crafting system in [[Pocket Edition Alpha]]. While she explains the acronym, a contradictory one is spelled out on-screen, "Maybe Another Top Ten is Stupid." She then talks about how MATTIS is named after a Mojang employee, who apparently distracted the writer of the video over a stamp collection.

The video cuts to a sponsorship from "Squiggly Farms Home-Spawned Squid Milk," which leads to the fact that [[squid]] used to be [[Milk Bucket|milkable]]. The fourth trivia is about witches, who aren't milkable, but are based off the {{Wikipedia|Russian}} folklore [[Baba Yaga]], which they refuse to show an image of. The next trivia is about horses, which originated from the mod ''Mo' Creatures''. Upon seeing the rest of the mobs in the mod, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. has an episode. The next scene talks about [[Spectator|spectator mode]], originally just a developer tool. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. uses it to go into Baba Yaga's house.

After showing off various achievements from human history, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. segues into the sixth fact, the 2015 world record of "most people dressed as Steve." After that, M.A.R.I.L.LA. tells a story about a revolution over a refusal to restore squid milk to the game, endangering millions of actual squids, ending with the annihilation of mankind. However, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. says this will happen in 2019, not 2016. The real fact is that Minecraft won the ''{{Wikipedia|BAFTA Children's Award}}''. In 2017, talks about a limited edition {{Wikipedia|Xbox One S}} made to look like a [[dirt]] block, which she initially confuses with an actual block of dirt, before talking about several [[easter eggs]], such as a hidden message in the [[Standard Galactic Alphabet]]. The final segment is about the [[Update Aquatic]], and how [[bubble column]]s could jettison squids out of the ocean, and scout locations for the uprising.

==== Transcript ====
Hello again! My name is [OLD MODEM SOUND] and I haven't seen the outside of this closet for ten
years! That's the perfect segue into today's video, Ten Things You Didn't Know
About The Last Ten Years of Minecraft.
Minecraft almost never existed

[TEN]

Minecraft almost never existed!
Originally, the studio that would become Mojang was making a top-down strategy
game called "Rubydung". Wow! That's a great name! We definitely should have
called Minecraft "Rubydung". In fact, I've computed together alternative names
which would have made the game 1 million percent more successful.
[CHEESY MUSIC]

[NINE]

In 2010, we added crafting to Minecraft.
But what you might not know is that the crafting system we
later added for Pocket Edition Alpha was called MATTIS, which stands for Minecraft
Advanced Touch Technology Interface System. MATTIS is named after a Mojang
employee of the same name, who kept trying to distract the person who was
writing the script for this video, which is why the next line is "Mattis, go away.
No, I don't want to see your stamp collection!"

[EIGHT]

And now, for a quick word from our sponsor!
Squid milk! The delicious taste of rotting squid, now finally
available as a drink! Yes, 2011 was the year we added squid
milking to the game. Because squid were based on cow behaviour, players soon
realised you could get milk from them, just like a cow!

[SEVEN]

In 2012, we added the witch to Minecraft,
as part of the Pretty Scary Update. And you can't
milk the witch, so don't even try. But did you know the witch is based on a Russian
folklore called Baba Yaga? Baba is cute right? No, Baba is this:
Baba Yaga lives in a hut which has chicken legs. That's nice,
I have no follow-up questions!

[SIX]

Horses galloped into Minecraft! But did you know
that they came from a player mod called Mo' Creatures? I wonder what other
adorable mobs we could potentially add from it to Minecraft? Let's take a
lovely look at the other cuties that ...no! no! no! no! Ctrl-Z! Ctrl-Z! Escape!
Escape! Escape!

[FIVE]

Spectator Mode was originally just a developer tool, but
Spectator Mode was such a smash they left it in for the players. I love
Spectator Mode! It lets me check in on this cool house I built to stave off my
crushing loneliness! Here, I'll give you a tour.

[FOUR]

Humanity has achieved some great and impressive feats,
none of which we'll be talking about today. Instead, let's forever remember
2015 as the year the world record was set for the most people dressed as Steve.
Bravo to all 337 people who took part, you're all 337 % more brilliant than
anyone else alive.

[THREE]

2016 was a slightly bad year for Minecraft. We refused to
re-add squid milking, so millions of Minecraft players took to the actual
seas, desperate for a squid milking fix. The squid had no choice but to fight
back, and within minutes they'd taken over the planet.
The streets ran black with ink, for the age of the squid was... oh hang on, oh I'm sorry
I've accessed the wrong year! This squid uprising isn't due to happen till 2019.
No, 2016 was actually the year where we won the BAFTA Children's Award again.
(Laughs) Don't worry about 2019....

[TWO]

In 2017 we released a special Minecraft version of
the Xbox One S, designed to look like a dirt block. Wow! It's so realistic!
Oh, that makes more sense.
This lean, green, Minecraft-playing
machine may look all innocent, but this dirt box is actually hiding some dirty
secrets. For example, on the outside, there's a message written in the
galactic alphabet. According to my translation circuits, it says "Your
translation software has expired, please purchase a new license." Fascinating!
That's not the only hidden message buried within this dirt block Xbox One S,
but if I tell you how to find the others they'll unplug me....

[ONE]

In 2018 we released the Update Aquatic, that filled the oceans with new life! Unfortunately, we
also accidentally booted a lot of the old life out of the ocean. The developers
made bubble columns too powerful, so they blasted squids right out of the seas
where they'll now be free to explore the overworld. Oh, and begin the squid
uprising. Umm....best of luck, humanity!
Thank you so much for watching.
Don't forget to like and subscribe, and I'll see you next time
for 10 ways you can appease our new squid overlords.

=== Update Aquatic ===
{{Infobox video|date=June 28, 2019|length=5:54|image=10things mc updateaquatic.jpg}}{{YouTube|z8fF4yb0aGc}}

==== Summary ====
As the video begins, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. voices an unwillingness to continue the show. The first piece of trivia this time is that, "uniquely," a bug was almost added, in the form of [[salmon]] "raining from the sky!" This reminds M.A.R.I.L.L.A. of the bubble column glitch from the previous episode, and ponders about renaming the update to the "It-Shouldn't-Be-In-The-Sky Update." The next segment is about [[Tropical Fish|tropical fish]], going over their many variations, of which M.A.R.I.L.L.A.'s favorite is "variation 3583" and least favorite is variation 3582. After offending 3582, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. begins talking about [[pufferfish]], hyping it up as a force to be reckoned with. However, she then discovers they only hurt non-aquatic mobs, as it kills Steve.

The seventh fact is about [[turtle]]s, showing one getting electrocuted by [[Thunderstorm|lightning]] and turned into a [[bowl]]. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. finds this relatable, claiming that she gained sentience from being hit by lightning, and as a reward got a bowl labeled "congratulations on becoming sentient." From there the video explains why [[polar bear]]s don't spawn on icebergs directly; they would slide away from each other, ruining packs. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. finds this so sad that she "downloaded the ability to cry."<ref group="note">In truth a file named "blubbering-mess.exe."</ref> After crying, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. begins talking about [[kelp]], calling it the only reason people play the game, while becoming hypnotized by it. After nearly leaking the next update, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. explains why it's animated, and shows newspapers to prove the world "went crazy for kelp!"

The fourth fact is about [[phantom]]s, the winner of the first [[Community Vote|Mob Vote]]. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. scolds the players' choices, before calling its early designs primitive and like a sock puppet, which ironically she is afraid of. After this, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. discusses the design process for dolphins, which they recorded in person, one of which hoping they'll be in [[Scrolls]]. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. then asks for {{Wikipedia|lions}} to stop being requested, and segues into how the [[drowned]]'s sounds were recorded; by gurgling milk, since it sounds "better" than actual water. The final fact is about turtles returning to where they spawned, which is based off real life, illustrated by a Minecraft turtle traveling on land across many vehicles. As the video wraps up, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. reveals she's not waterproof.

Hello once again! My name is [OLD MODEM SOUND] and I can't seem to stop listing Minecraft trivia
no matter how much I want to stop!
Anyway, here's ten things you probably didn't know about Update Aquatic.

[TEN]

In a first for Minecraft, this update almost introduced a bug to the game!
Salmon could rain from the sky. You know, considering we almost accidentally made
salmon skyborne, and we originally made bubble columns too powerful and sent
squid flying into the sky,
maybe we should have just scrapped this Update Aquatic and remarketed it as this.

[NINE]

We found a way to fill the ocean with colour -
without just pouring paint into it! Instead, we filled it with tropical fish.
Because of all the different colours and types we included, there are actually
3584 variants of tropical fish. Wow!
What's your favourite tropical fish variation?
Mine's variation 3583.
Because variation 3582 is the WORST.

[EIGHT]

The Update Aquatic introduced a mob of incredible power. All other mobs tremble in fear
before the ocean's deadliest cuboid...
The PUFFERFISH.
Yes, this spiky gasbag can harm any other mob. Creepers flee, spiders scatter,
skeletons run crying to their mothers! And all the underwater mobs are...
completely fine.
Oh, it seems the pufferfish can only hurt mobs that aren't of the undersea
variety, and since the pufferfish can't leave the sea, I guess it's no threat to anyone! Hooray!
Oh, except you.

[SEVEN]

Everybody loves turtles! Well, except the god of thunder.
When turtles get hit by lightning, you don't just get a load of emails from
angry parents asking why this game is marketed to children, no - lightning strikes
also turn turtles into bowls! This is actually a very relatable fact because
when I got struck by lightning, I gained sentience!
Oh, and I also got this nifty bowl.

[SIX]

Polar bears can only spawn on flat ice, because when we
originally let them spawn on icebergs, the mother polar bear and child polar bear
would be ....separated!
Noooo!
This revelation is so sad that I've just downloaded the ability to cry.
Hope I'm waterproof!
[SOBS LOUDLY]
It should've been meeee!

[FIVE]

Kelp! It's basically the only reason anyone plays Minecraft! Just look at it....dancing away....
It's so...... hypnotic...
What were we talking about again? The next update to Minecraft? Which is The --
Oh, er, no, sorry. We're talking kelp! Because this is an undersea plant,
Papel Burn
the developers decided it couldn't just be stationary like plants you see in the
Overworld. So kelp became the first animated plant in Minecraft!
Needless to say, the world went crazy for kelp!

[FOUR]

This was the first major update to
feature a mob voted for by you, the players. And you chose a terrifying
sky monster! Thank you SO much!
This is the Phantom, and it went through a lot of
changes during development. It originally had a mouth, but the developers thought
it made the mob look too much like a sock puppet.
Yes, for some reason they thought this mouthless monstrosity was scarier than
THIS.

[THREE]

Because Minecraft is the most realistic game in the world, when we added dolphins
we didn't just guess what dolphins sound like then put those sounds into the game.
Nope, we recorded real dolphins. Coincidentally, our sound team would like
you to stop asking us to add lions to the game.
We had to use special underwater microphones called hydrophones.
But it was all worth it though,
because now Minecraft is full of authentically-researched dolphin sounds. I wonder what they're saying?

[TWO]

We also needed sounds for our new underwater undead, the Drowned.
Sadly, zombies don't exist,
so we created the sounds of the Drowned by gurgling milk.
Gross!
Yes we didn't record water to get the sounds of the sea, we
always recorded milk. It just sounds better! So, the oceans of
Minecraft should actually look like this.
Wait-- if we do that we can't see all that magnificent kelp!

[ONE]

Turtles in Minecraft will always return
to the place where they first spawned to lay their eggs, no matter how far they
need to travel. This is because in real life
sea turtles swim to their birthplace to lay their eggs. Turtles find their way
home by relying on unique magnetic signatures across the coast.

=== Hostile Mobs ===
{{Infobox video|image=10 Things Minecraft Hostile Mobs Thumbnail.jpg|date=August 2, 2019|length=5:53}}{{YouTube|V6eDuYKCrZ8}}

==== Summary ====
The episode opens with M.A.R.I.L.L.A. expressing love toward an [[enderman]], before correcting the topic to being about hostile mobs, beginning with baby [[zombie]]s. Pointing out that babies are faster than adults, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. questions if this makes adults unhealthy, generating a list of advice for their health and safety.<ref group="note">This includes "only eat brains of healthy people," "try to stick to organic rotten flesh," "get at least five fruit, vegetables, or villagers a day," "gain some healthy vitamin D by standing in the sunlight!" and "oh wait definitely don't do that last one."</ref> From there the topic changes to slimes, which M.A.R.I.L.L.A. expresses immense distaste for, before explaining that they can be [[Name Tag|nametagged]] and split when killed, dedicating a memorial to a slime she named Jens. Afterwards, the video talks about the introduction of [[ravager]]s, mentioning their original name of "[[illager]] beast," before showing several design drafts deemed to be quite hideous, before finally settling on a design that was both intimidating and goofy. It's explained [[Jens Bergensten]] was inspired by the [https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Manticore manticore] from ''{{Wikipedia|Dungeons & Dragons}}''.

Afterwards, the topic becomes about [[endermite]]s, the smallest hostile mob at the time. M.A.R.I.L.L.A. names them various things, all of which insulting the mob for being useless and annoying. The sixth fact is dedicated to spiders, because M.A.R.I.L.L.A. is a self-proclaimed arachnid expert due to her time banished to a closet. The fact is that they used to be brown. The fifth fact is about how endermen used to have green eyes, which is why [[eyes of ender]] are green. From there several magazine parodies are shown. The fourth segment is devoted to [[ghast]]s, which is insulted and deemed unpopular, before M.A.R.I.L.L.A. is reprimanded by hearing ghast sounds. The fact becomes that [[fireball]]s could theoretically go on, and on, forever, if it never hits anything. This culminates in it flying up into the [[sky]], past an {{Wikipedia|airplane}}, out of the atmosphere into space, past an alien {{Wikipedia|Generation ship|spacecraft}}, and into a {{Wikipedia|black hole}}, only to just hit [[cobblestone]]. 

For the next fact, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. confesses to wanting to live in a [[swamp]], praying for an enderman to take her there. From there she discusses how slime spawning is affected by the phases of the [[moon]], before suffering a psychotic episode at the sight of a [[pig]]. The penultimate fact is about [[silverfish]] being able to see through walls, which is apparently unimpressive, before M.A.R.I.L.L.A. kills the silverfish in service to an enderman. The final fact is about the [[Mob (entity)|mob]] [[mob]], showing a chart of their biology with several facts.<ref group="note">'''FACIAL EXPRESSION MUST NEVER CHANGE'''<br />When I asked Jens why, his facial expression became one of horror. Too afraid to ask again.</ref><ref group="note">'''LIMBS MUST ROTATE IN UNNATURAL, CREEPY WAYS'''

Hello there! My name is [OLD MODEM SOUND] and welcome to Ten Reasons The Enderman Is A Total Cutie [wolf-whistle]
Oh, wait - wrong video. I mean, welcome to Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Hostile Mobs.

[TEN]

What's deadlier? A fully grown adult zombie, or an adorable baby
zombie. If you thought it was the adult zombie, then congratulations! You're
already DEAD. Baby zombies are 30% faster than adult zombies. How terrible!
What could be causing the adult undead to be so slow and unhealthy?
I've computed together a list of tips to improve the health of all our adult zombie viewers.
You're welcome, middle-aged flesh munchers!

[NINE]

Everybody loves the -- slimes? Seriously? Ughhh. Fine. [Clears throat]
Everybody loves slimes! And if you put a name tag on them, you can name them!
But what you might not know is that if this creepy cube somehow croaked, it
sometimes spawns several smaller slimes, and those will have the same name too!
They'll bounce off to spread your good name through the overworld. Hey, maybe
this will be your legacy now Jens?

[EIGHT]

Every new update brings new threats, and
the Village and Pillage update was no exception. It introduced the Ravager.
Originally known as the Illager Beast, the Ravager went through several redesigns.
Thing is, we didn't want an evil- looking mob, we wanted a goofy-looking mob.
Lead Creative Designer Jens Bergensten
took a lot of inspiration from older games when
designing the Ravager, like Dungeons and Dragons. So clever!

[SEVEN]

Endermites are the smallest hostile mob in Minecraft.
They sometimes spawn when an ender pearl
is thrown, and then they despawn after a couple of minutes. Good! However, if you
put name tags on endermites they won't despawn. Um, why would you want to do that?

[SIX]

As someone who's been trapped in a closet full of spiders for ten years, I
am quite the arachnid expert. Minecraft spiders are plenty horrible, but way back
in the earliest days of Minecraft, they were very different.
They used to be brown.

[FIVE]

Originally, the Enderman had green eyes. That's why the item Eye of Ender
is green! However, the Enderman's eye colour was swiftly changed to purple. Cute!
This was most likely done so the Enderman's eyes would match the purple of the
portals and portal particles. After all, it's important that our terrifying
creatures of pure nightmare learn to coordinate, darling.

[FOUR]

Everybody loves the Ghast! And by everybody, I mean presumably somebody?
Yes this poor little poltergeist has a little bit of an image problem, and a
huge bit of a sound problem. [Ghast Screeching] No, not the noise! I will stop the video if you keep making that noise.
Ghasts can spit fireballs.
But what you might not know is what happens if that fireball doesn't hit anything.
Theoretically it could keep going on forever. Minecraft's worlds can generate
infinitely, so if a Ghast spat a fireball at a high enough altitude and
you can somehow keep the chunks it was passing through active, it would keep going,
and going, and going.....
[EPIC MUSIC]
Oh. Unless it hits cobblestone.

[THREE]

I've said it before, and I will say it again.
I want to live in a swamp. When will some handsome Enderman teleport me from my
closet and dump me in a swamp? Sigh. Someday....
Anyway, slimes spawn in swamp biomes.
But did you know the number of slimes that spawn depends on how full the moon is?
During a full moon you get the most slimes, and during a new moon, no slimes will spawn at all. Wow.
I wonder if any other mobs are affected by moonlight?
Like this little fellow, oh so cute....
Oh -- no, no no no! Onwards, to number two! silverfish there everybody sixty-seventh

[TWO]

Silverfish!
They're everybody's sixty-seventh favourite mob in Minecraft.
But did you know they can see through walls?
That means a silverfish could be watching you, not being impressed by that fact,
RIGHT NOW! Also, did you know that they won't drop anything apart from
experience? Here, I'll show you!
Did the Enderman see that? Did it look impressed?

[ONE]

Why are all these Steves spinning? Is it because their minds have
been blown by the fact that spiders used to be brown? Actually, this is from an
earlier version of Minecraft where we introduced humans to the game for the
first time. Um, maybe we should have done more research into human behaviour.
No idea why we took these out of the game. Who wouldn't want to see this every
time they play Minecraft?

Thank you SO much for watching.
Don't forget to like and
subscribe and...[gasp] oh my goodness!
I don't believe it! [giggles]
They wrote a nice-ish comment on my video!
This is like living in a fairy tale, I can't believe it....

=== Passive & Neutral Mobs ===
{{Infobox video|image=10 Things Minecraft Neutral & Passive Mobs Thumbnail.jpg|date=August 30, 2019|length=6:39}}{{YouTube|2zrD0ijjbUk}}

==== Summary ====
Beginning on startup, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. tells a story where a witch tricked her into giving up her body, before moving on to talk about ''Minecraft'' again. The first fact is about pigs, and the [[When Pigs Fly]] [[achievement]], which is deemed cruel and injures Steve. Inspired, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. makes up an achievement for subscribing to the channel. The second fact is about whether squids have an idle sound, which turns out to be frequency used by the Squid Overlords. The third is about cows, with M.A.R.I.L.L.A. claiming they originally used a kazoo to make their moos. However, she also claims to have lost the sound effect, so instead she shows a fan letter claiming the current version is beloved by fans.

The third fact talks about the introduction of new villager professions, a butcher claiming to want to be a dancer. A sheep that spawns in a house. A message is then shown for vegetarian and vegan players, asking if they'd like animals to use weapons to balance meat consumption. The fourth fact is M.A.R.I.L.L.A.  asking for the viewer's "favorite gift," coldly condemning "that malware Jens got [her] for Christmas." This segues to an overview of cats gifting players when they [[Bed|sleep]], a cat giving Steve [[rotten flesh]]. The joke of wishing for a dog instead helps transition to a segment about [[wolves]], about a bug which caused shot players to be hunted by tamed wolves. The next fact is about correcting a mistake from the previous video; that enderman are neutral, not hostile, which was pointed out by many viewers. However, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. proceeds to claim they are hostile, because one rejected on a date.

The seventh fact is about how parrots can mimic voices, which leads to a joke where one parrots a Squid Overlord. The parrot then scares Steve, which causes footage to repeat from the pig segment. The penultimate fact is about lightning, and how it affects [[mooshroom]]s, turning them brown or red. This segues to M.A.R.I.L.LA. [[Skeleton Horse|killing]] a [[horse]]. The final fact is about foxes holding items, such as enchanted [[sword]]s, as well as once [[armor]]. This is represented by foxes with diamond bodies, which creep up on skeletons. They are then sent after the enderman that dismissed M.A.R.I.L.LA., who receives comeuppance by getting swarmed with comments again.

Hello again! My name is [OLD MODEM SOUND] and if a witch offers you three magic beans in exchange
for your body being trapped in a computer for all eternity, I strongly
recommend you turn her down. Anyway, here's ten things you probably didn't know about neutral and passive mobs.

[TEN]

Pigs are the oldest passive mob in Minecraft.
But did you also know they're necessary to get one of Minecraft's meanest
Achievements? To get the "When Pigs Fly" Achievement, you need to ride a pig off a
cliff and take fall damage. That poor porker!
Oh, and you I guess.
Achievements are brilliant, aren't they? Why not try and get the "Like and Subscribe to our YouTube Channel" Achievement?

[NINE]

Minecraft squid! They're my favourite silent sea-life.
But what if ... they're not silent at all?
It's true!
Squid do have an idle noise in Minecraft,
it's just very quiet. Let's give it a listen!
[Squid Noise]
Let's turn that up a bit.
[Louder Squid Noise]
Not bad, but let's turn it up six thousand percent, treble the bass, loop
it through a synthesizer, and play it backwards.
"The squid uprising is in motion,
soon the world will be in our tendrils."
Let's move on!

[EIGHT]

Don't cows sound lovely? [moo, moo] Cow sounds weren't always this
pleasant. Originally, we used a kazoo to make them, and so the
cows sounded like this.
[SOUND OF CAR ENGINE STARTING]
Okay, so I seem to have deleted the original cow sound,
but who cares? Because the modern cow sound we use today is easily everyone's
favourite part of Minecraft. Just look at our fan mail!

[SEVEN]

The Village & Pillage update brought loads of new villager professions, like
the fisherman,
the librarian,
and the butcher.
And sometimes, sheep spawn in
butcher's houses. [Chuckling] Oh dear. Anyway, we now interrupt this video for a
quick message for our vegetarian and vegan viewers.

[SIX]

What's the most disappointing present you've ever gotten?
Mine was that malware Jens got me for Christmas.
But did you know that a mob in Minecraft could potentially bring you gifts? Tame a cat,
and every dawn will feel like Christmas morning! Simply sleep in a bed, and your
tamed cat will greet you and the new day with a gift. What did you get me today
Mr. Whiskers? It's rotten flesh again. I knew I should have got a dog!

[FIVE]

Cats can keep their pathetic presents! Everyone knows the tamed wolf is the perfect
Minecraft companion. However, that wasn't always the case. Say you're out hunting
with your wolf pals, and you brought a bow and arrow.
Oh, looks like you've accidentally shot yourself there! Not to worry, it doesn't take
off too much health. Except... this bug, which we promise we've probably fixed,
meant that if you hit yourself with an arrow, your tamed wolves would suddenly want to
attack, well....you.

[FOUR]

Everyone knows that this series is known for its flawless accuracy,
incredible attention to detail, and 100% true Minecraft facts. That's why we've won
thousands of awards!
[SOUND OF WIND IN A VAST LONELY DESERT]
However, in our last episode about hostile mobs, we said
Endermen were a hostile mob, but they're actually a neutral mob. A mistake one or
two of you pointed out...
Luckily, I have proof that the Enderman *is* hostile.
We recently hung out for a nice meal. Sure, they teleported away as soon as the
bill arrived but, nobody's perfect! But ever since, they haven't responded to my
DMs, my emails, my phone calls, and I've heard nothing back. If that isn't hostile
behaviour, I don't know what is.

[THREE]

In Minecraft, parrots have the fun habit of
imitating nearby mobs. They'd never use that power for evil, would they?
Of course not!....often.
Usually, parrrots imitate nearby mobs, but there's a teeny tiny chance they
might imitate the sound of a random mob.
"The squid uprising is in motion, soon the world will be in our tendrils."
So there you are, enjoying a spot of gardening, when suddenly you hear -
[SPIDER SOUNDS]
Run! Run! Forget the garden, it's too late for it now, save yourself!

[TWO]

Have you ever been struck by lightning? Irritating, isn't it? Look what happens
when a red mooshroom get struck by lightning - it turns into a brown mooshroom,
just like in real life! Getting hit by lightning gives the horse a makeover too.
Let's see what happens. Ooh, I hope it's a perm!
Aww, cute!

[ONE]

Foxes can carry stuff in their mouths. This isn't just a super-gross saliva-stuffed
storage solution, it can help you in fights! Drop an enchanted sword and a fox
that picks it up will attack things with the same attack damage as the sword!
Plus, a bug used to even let you dress foxes in diamond armor!
[FOX SCREECH]
[WILHELM SCREAM]
Outro
Actually.... I think I know a certain Enderman that you adorable orange
avengers should visit next ....(creepy laughter).

Thank you SO much for watching! Don't forget to like and
subscribe, and I'll see you next time for Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About -
oh, I've left my comments analyzer on...
Slow down, one at a time, one at a time!

Hello there! My name is [OLD MODEM NOISE], Mojang's beloved computer.
And every time you try and unplug me, I just get stronger...
Here's ten things you probably didn't know about Minecraft blocks.

[TEN]

The Crafting Table wasn't always called the Crafting Table. [Gasps]
Originally it was called the Workbench. A classic example of somebody changing
their job title to make it sound like they do more work than they actually do.
You can even find Crafting Tables in the wild! In villager libraries, in igloos and
even in witch huts. What sinister things could the witches be crafting?
Well actually, they're crafting lovely Valentine's cards that are only slightly sinister.
Awwww!

[NINE]


In 2019, Minecraft changed forever, when we added lecterns as part of the Lecterns & Lecterns update.
Oh hang on, we scrapped that rubbish
and went with Village & Pillage. It took us six years from ideation to
development to put lecterns into Minecraft. Lecterns are actually the
hardest feature to add to a video game. Just look at our failed attempts!

[EIGHT]

Oh good! My new Netherrack block arrived! I hope it lasts long than my last one...
Oh gosh darnit!!
Did you know that if a Netherrack block catches fire,
it'll keep burning forever?A bit like that DVD player I have to share this
closet with, that can't even play my copy of Short Circuit 2!
Netherrack isn't the only block that will burn forever.
So does Bedrock,
the Magma block, and the Blue Wool block.
Okay, not Blue Wool blocks, I just don't like 'em.
Burn!

[SEVEN]

Netherrack wasn't always called Netherrack. It was originally called
BLOODSTONE.
Here, I'll digitally compose some much nicer names.
Coarse Dirt
[SIX]
Coarse Dirt is nobody's favourite Minecraft block,
apart from the editors of this Coarse Dirt magazine.
I'm not shallow, but even I'll admit that when I found out we'd be looking at the course dirt block
today, I did try to delete my own eyes.
Oh please don't cry Coarsey.
Why don't you try growing some grass on your head and giving yourself a cool haircut?
[Gasps] Oh, that's right.
The Coarse Dirt block will never ever let grass grow on it, and you know what?
That's the kind of commitment to staying hideous that I respect!

[FIVE]

Bedrock! It's the stuff surrounding the core of your world, and our friendly way of stopping
you digging right through it. But did you know that Bedrock used to give off a cool
particle effect? Why did we remove that? Well it's because we felt guilty, okay?
The more time you spend cooped up inside admiring Bedrock, is less time you spend
in the great outdoors enjoying the wonders of the Overworld.
...Actually, maybe the great outdoors isn't so great.

[FOUR]

Yeah, sorry I've got nothing.

[THREE]

I love Birch Wood blocks! They're like if granite was interesting.
But did you know about the super rare biome Birch Forest M?
This biome contains extremely tall birch trees. Many have searched for this biome,
only to never be seen again. Probably just cos it's really nice there!
Those rumours about a lonely computer who lurks in Birch Forest M and doesn't let
people leave until they like and subscribe to the Minecraft YouTube
channel are simply absurd!

[TWO]

Quiz time!
What were the first blocks ever added to Minecraft?
Ready? If you guessed the cobblestone block, the grass block, and the Block of
Eternal Screaming, then I'm sorry but you were only two-thirds right. Good guess though!
Thanks for trying. [Screaming]
But did you know that you could travel back
in time to see what Minecraft was like way back in 2009?
You can run Minecraft Classic in your browser, and enjoy a gameplay experience
that truly stretches the definition of the word "classic" to breaking point!
You can find a link for it in the description of this video.
Minecraft Classic is so user-friendly, even I can almost run it without crashing more than on---

[ONE]

Note Blocks are the greatest musical instrument the human race has
ever seen! If only The Beatles had learnt how to play Note Blocks instead
of guitars, they probably would have been a lot more successful! But did you know
that Note Blocks are tuned to F-sharp? All planets emit an audible modulation
and every planet has a dominant note. The note emitted by Earth is tuned to
F-sharp. Our poor planet doesn't get nearly
enough respect for the audio it emits... just morons mining through it.
So Mother Earth, we hope this incredibly small gesture from us makes up for every bad
thing the human race has ever done to you. You're welcome!

Thank you SO much for watching! Don't forget to like and subscribe, and I'll see you next time,
when I'm exclusively revealing the next update to Minecraft! I don't know
what it is yet, but I've just downloaded this teaser image!
Oh, NO....

== Trivia ==

* Throughout the series, M.A.R.I.L.L.A. makes several pop culture references and puns.
** In ''Village & Pillage'',  M.A.R.I.L.L.A. lists off several books made to appeal to cats. These are largely puns on existing media, including ''{{Wikipedia|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|The Great Gatsby}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|To Kill a Mockingbird}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|The Handmai'd Tail}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|The Catcher in the Rye}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|Eat, Pray, Love}}'', ''{{Wikipedia|Leaves of Grass}}'', {{Wikipedia|Catch-22}}, and the musical ''{{Wikipedia|Cats (musical)|Cats}}''.
** In ''The Last Ten Years'', "Avengers Engame" is listed as an alternative name for ''Minecraft'', referencing the {{Wikipedia|Avengers: Endgame|2019 film}} of the same name. Another name, ''Fifty Shades of [[Clay]]'', is a pun on the 2011 erotic fiction novel ''{{Wikipedia|Fifty Shades of Grey}}''. The name ''Minecraft: Battle Royale'' is also a reference to the {{Wikipedia|Battle royale game|battle royale}} genre of video games, which became popular in 2019 due to games such as ''{{Wikipedia|Fortnite}}''. Later in the video, a picture of the {{Wikipedia|Space Shuttle Columbia}} is shown, which became infamous for an {{Wikipedia|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|accident}} that resulted in the death of eleven astronauts onboard.
** During Hostile Mobs, a magazine can be seen labeled "Magnificent Mobs Monthly, 35" a parody of tabloids. On the cover, "Selena Gamez" is quoted saying "Enderman is Mine," referencing actress and pop singer {{Wikipedia|Selena Gomez}}.
