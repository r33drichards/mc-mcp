=== Blocks ===
'''[[Azalea]]'''
* Bush block which can be planted on [[dirt]] and [[grass block]]s.

'''[[Dripleaf]] '''
* Allows an entity to stay on it for 1.5 seconds (30 [[tick]]s), before the entity will fall through it.
** The tilt happens in 3 stages: unstable, partial and full.
*** All the stages are solid except the full stage, which is when the player falls through.
*** When nobody is standing on it, it is set to none stage.
* Comes in two sizes: small and big. Small can be applied [[bone meal]] to grow into big.
** Small Dripleaf can only be obtained with [[shears]] (otherwise breaks), and can only be planted on [[clay]] or underwater on clay and [[dirt]] blocks.
** Big Dripleaf can be obtained with any [[tool]] or by hand as well as breaking it using [[projectile]]s and can be planted on grass and dirt blocks.
* The tilt can also be triggered by hitting the plant with a projectile.
* The tilt can be prevented by powering it with [[redstone]], but hitting it with a projectile still tilts.
* Available under Experimental Gameplay.

'''[[Hanging Roots]]'''
* Decorative blocks that can only be placed on the underside of a block.
* Obtained with [[shears]], otherwise breaks.
* Available under Experimental Gameplay.

'''[[Moss Block]]'''

* Uses the same texture as the moss block, but one pixel thick.
* Crafted with moss blocks.
* Available under Experimental Gameplay.

'''[[Rooted Dirt]]'''
* Decorative block with roots on its texture.

'''[[Block of Copper]], [[Cut Copper]], and variants'''

* [[Axe]]s can now be {{Control|used}} to scrape off wax and oxidation (one stage at a time).
** Scraping off the wax from the block emits white particles.
* [[Lightning]] can now clean oxidation, reverting the oxidation process by one or several stages.
** Chances of cleaning and number of reverted stages are higher the closer to the struck block.
* The Copper Block variant names are now changed to match ''Java Edition''.
** Renamed Copper Block to Block of Copper.

=== World generation ===     
'''[[Lush Caves]] generation'''
* Currently added as a feature code file, does not generate in the overworld yet, and can only be generated using [[add-ons]].
* Adaptive to the environment: every type of cave generation can be a lush cave.
* [[Moss Block|Moss]] covers the floors and ceilings, along with [[moss carpet]]s and [[grass]] on the floors.
* [[Spore Blossom]]s grow from the ceiling and drip particles.
* Contains [[clay]] pools where [[dripleaf]] plants grow out of them.
** [[Clay]] pools will sometimes generate [[water]] sources over [[air]], and the water is suspended and does not flow. This has yet to be fixed.
* Contains [[azalea]] bushes (both variants).
* [[Cave vines]] with [[glow berries]] grow from the ceiling and light up the caves.
[[File:World Gen Changes Bedrock 1.16.220.jpg|thumb|World generation changes, with Bedrock layers going all the way down to y=-64 on the old chunks.]]
'''[[Altitude]]'''
* Generation range and build limits have been expanded by 64 blocks down, to a total range of 384 blocks.
** To allow old world to generate with the new build limits, old chunks will generate Bedrock layers all the way to Y=-64 to fill up the void gap between Y=0 and Y=-64.
'''[[Generated structures|Structures]]'''
* Underground [[cave]]s, [[canyon]]s and structures now generate all the way down to Y=-64.
