[[File:Banjo_&_Kazooie_SSBU.png|right|frameless]]
Beginning in 1998, ''{{Wikipedia|Banjo-Kazooie}}'' is a series of platformer games developed by {{Wikipedia|Rare (company)|Rare}}, revolving around the bear [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Banjo Banjo] and the breegull [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Kazooie Kazooie] fighting the evil witch [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Gruntilda Gruntilda]. Secondary to the protagonists are the mole [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Bottles Bottles], the shaman [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Mumbo_Jumbo Mumbo Jumbo], Gruntilda's minion [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Klungo Klungo], and Banjo's little sister [https://banjokazooiewiki.com/wiki/Tooty Tooty]. The series is known for its dry sense of humor, numerous collectibles, and influence on later platformers. 

After a long hiatus, the series briefly returned in 2008 with the game ''{{Wikipedia|Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts}}'', which was considered a radical departure from the rest of the franchise, focusing more on vehicle creation over platforming. As part of the promotion for the game, the prior two entries were rereleased on the {{Wikipedia|Xbox 360}}, remade by [[4J Studios]]. In 2012, several characters from the franchise made an appearance as skins in [[Skin Pack 1]]. Updated skins would later appear in the [[2nd Birthday Skin Pack]]. Coincidentally, both [[Steve]] and Banjo would be represented in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'']] as part of the Fighter Pass.{{-}}

Released in 2001, ''{{Wikipedia|Conker's Bad Fur Day}}'' is a platform game created by Rare. The project originated as ''Twelve Tales: Conker 64'', a conventional "cutesy" platforming game, however following initial feedback the game was overhauled into a raunchy comedy aimed at adult audiences. The final release follows [https://conkerwiki.com/wiki/Conker Conker], a cynical alcoholic squirrel who awakens in the [https://conkerwiki.com/wiki/Panther_Kingdom Panther Kingdom] after a hangover, and has to go on an adventure home or else risk becoming the leg of a table. The game received critical acclaim for its sense of humor, but ended up underperforming due to releasing late into the lifespan of the {{Wikipedia|Nintendo 64}}.

In 2005, a remake of the game was released on the original {{Wikipedia|Xbox (console)|Xbox}}, titled ''{{Wikipedia|Conker: Live & Reloaded}}''. This iteration of Conker would appear in the [[skin packs]] [[Skin Pack 3]] and [[2nd Birthday Skin Pack]].
