'''15w45a''' is the thirty-ninth [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.9]], released on November 5, 2015.<ref>{{link|url=https://www.mojang.com/2015/11/minecraft-snapshot-15w45a/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106035422/https://www.mojang.com/2015/11/minecraft-snapshot-15w45a/|title=Minecraft snapshot 15w45a|author=Searge|website=Mojang.com|date=Nov 5, 2015}}</ref> The development team's aim had been to have the 1.9 release feature-complete by the end of October 2015, followed by a period of bug-fixing,<ref>{{tweet|Dinnerbone|654679981029593088|We are aiming to get Minecraft 1.9 feature complete at end of this month. Feature complete doesn't mean bug free & ready to release, though!|Oct 15, 2015}}</ref> and this snapshot was the first snapshot during that planned time period of bug-fixing.

== Additions ==
=== General ===
'''Realms'''
* Added a "Realms Notifications" toggle to the options menu.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Lily pad]]s'''
* Collision box was raised from {{frac|1|4}} of a pixel to 1 pixel in height.

=== Items ===
'''[[Map]]s'''
* Are crafted at a zoom level of 1:1, as was the case before [[15w34a]].
** Can no longer be zoomed in.
* This reverts maps to 1.8 behavior.

'''[[Shield]]s'''
* Placing a pattern on a shield now consumes the [[banner]].

=== Mobs ===
'''[[Elder guardian]]s'''
* Rare drops now only provide fish, as they had in 1.8 versions, eliminating fishing treasure and fishing junk that had been seen in snapshots.

'''[[Shulker]]'''
* Added sounds for shulkers getting damaged.

=== Non-mob entities ===
'''[[Boat]]s'''
* The dark oak boat can now be crafted.

=== Command format ===
'''General'''
* Tab-completed coordinate arguments now become tildes if no block is in focus.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
* The <code>Linger</code> byte tag on <code>ThrownPotion</code> entities has been removed. 
** Instead, the potion lingers if the stored item has an ID of <code>minecraft:lingering_potion</code>.
** The following command creates a <code>ThrownPotion</code> lingering potion: <code>/summon ThrownPotion ~ ~5 ~ {Potion:{id:"minecraft:lingering_potion",tag:{Potion:"minecraft:swiftness"}}}</code>.
* The <code>ThrownPotion</code> renders as its stored item, no matter the item.
** For instance, if the stored item has an ID of <code>minecraft:diamond_sword</code>, the potion appears as a diamond sword while being thrown.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Achievement]]s'''
* ''Overpowered'' is changed from "Build a Notch Apple" to "Eat a Notch Apple".

'''[[Jumping]]'''
* Jump height increased from {{frac|1|3|16}} blocks to {{frac|1|4|16}} blocks.

=== General ===
'''Optimizations'''
* Tweaks to pathfinding and monster AI.
* Some performance optimizations.
