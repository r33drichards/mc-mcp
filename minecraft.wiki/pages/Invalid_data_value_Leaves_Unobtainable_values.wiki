From versions in-20100131 to 14w05b, the historical appearances of leaves with damage 16 and above can be treated identically to those of damage 0 to 15, as the only visual difference is the durability bar in versions prior to Beta 1.4. There is currently no known way to obtain any of these in Survival mode; commands or inventory editors must be used.

Currently, the only tested items have damage values from 0 to 383. The behavior of values from 384 to 2147483647 is yet to be documented; from versions up to 14w08a as well as versions 14w25a and later they appear to be predictable.

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w10a|Invalid data value leaves now appear to have far more unpredictable models as damage values increase. This is due to the item picking model data from higher block IDs, however not all block models are copied. This complex behavior does not seem to repeat at any scale which has currently been checked.
|{{pximg|Leaves 16 (inventory) JE15.png|32px}} Leaves with a damage value of 16, 48, 64, 80, 96 or 104 now appear 3D and untinted.{{info needed|Do these correspond to blocks which do not use metadata?}}
|Most other damage values which were previously 2D and colored 17 to 31 remain as such. However, some groups exist of leaves which become 3D and uncolored, such as 82-85, 90-93, 114-117 and 122-125.{{info needed|Do these correspond to dispensers?}}

|{{HistoryLine|||dev=14w25a|{{pximg|Missing Model (inventory) JE1.png|32px}} All leaves with damage values above 3, therefore including those above 15, no longer have a model. Refer to the previous history sections for more information on how the missing item model changed.}}
