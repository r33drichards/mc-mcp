'''Ferns''' are a non-solid plant [[block]] found only in certain biomes and have the same characteristics as grass.

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
When [[Breaking|broken]] normally, ferns have a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 unit of [[wheat seeds]] when destroyed. This is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1-3, 1-5, or 1-7 wheat seeds respectively with Fortune I, II, and III. 

Ferns can be obtained as an item if mined by [[shears]]. [[Large fern]]s also drop two ferns when broken using shears.
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Fern|drop=0|shears=1}}

=== Natural generation ===
Ferns occur naturally only in [[jungle]], [[taiga]], [[snowy taiga]] and [[old growth taiga]] biomes.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|fern}}

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell ferns for 1 [[emerald]].
{{Trade sources}}

=== Post-generation ===
{{IN|bedrock}}, [[bone meal]] can be used on a [[grass block]] to grow ferns.

== Usage ==
=== Placement ===
Ferns can be placed on [[grass block]]s, [[podzol]], [[mycelium]], [[dirt]], [[coarse dirt]], [[rooted dirt]], [[mud]], [[muddy mangrove roots]], [[moss block]]s, [[pale moss block]]s and [[farmland]].

Ferns can also be placed in [[flower pot]]s.

[[File:Ferns placeable on.png|thumb|All the blocks that ferns can be placed on.]]

=== Grazing ===
When a [[sheep]] eats a fern, the block is destroyed, and a [[shear]]ed sheep regrows its [[wool]]. Baby sheep graze grass and ferns much more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

=== Composting ===
Placing a fern into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

=== Bone meal ===
[[Bone meal]] can be used on a fern to create a [[large fern]].
