A '''version banner''' is an image, usually a game screenshot, released alongside a development version or game release.

A list of all version banners can be found at [[:Category:Version banners]].

== ''Java Edition'' ==
Since {{vl|13w01a}}, the first snapshot for {{vl|Java Edition 1.5}}, most official changelogs for development and release versions of ''[[Java Edition]]'' are accompanied with a banner image showcasing some of the changes from that version. Some versions share the same banner image, especially if they have been released in the same week and share an official changelog blog post on [[minecraft.net]].

For development versions and minor releases, the banners usually consist of a screenshot taken ingame. Occasionally these screenshots include easter eggs, for example the developers being featured in a hidden way. For major releases, often promotional artwork in a more simplified look is used instead.
