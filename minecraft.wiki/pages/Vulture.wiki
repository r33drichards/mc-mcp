The '''vulture''' was a proposed mob that was featured in the [[Mob Vote]] at [[MINECON Live 2019]], alongside the [[frog]] and [[goat]]. It was a bird mob that would spawn in badlands, and mark where a [[player]] had died by circling their [[drops]]. Despite some confusion, it would not interact with the drops themselves, only flying above them.<ref>{{YouTube link|OZqNaEX8208|MINECON Live 2019|Minecraft|September 28, 2019|t=1h21m29s}}</ref>

It, along with the rest of the badlands features, lost with only 14% of the vote. Although the [[swamp]] features were later added in the [[The Wild Update|Wild Update]], the badlands have not.
