== Technical ==
=== General ===
'''Performance'''
* Huge performance improvements for old and slow computers.

== Fixes ==
'''14 bugs fixed'''
* Players are only 'on' a ladder (can climb it/fall slowly) if the lower half is in the ladder block, rather than any part of the player.
** It is no longer possible to climb with a one-block gap in a ladder, or a ladder that starts at eye level.
* On fancy graphics, the sides of grass blocks are now biome-specific and match the shade on the top.
* Player movement through water has been fixed to previous speed.
* Wolves' pathfinding now has a better understanding of doors. They go through doors most of the time, but sometimes get stuck on the 3-pixel thickness of the door.
* The lighting on portals and ice has been fixed when using smooth lighting.
* [[Stairs]] are no longer transparent to light.
* On multiplayer, the health of wolves are now synchronized between server and client, causing wolves to only whimper when low on health, as opposed to all of the time.
* Redstone in off state is red again.
* Crops hit with water now drop seeds and wheat, as opposed to just wheat.
* Moving minecarts continue to move if the world is closed.
* The Mojang logo is the correct size when the client is maximized.
* The exploit to make chests three or more side by side by placing a water source and placing a chest in that source has been fixed.
* Sugar cane can now only be placed on dirt.

== Trivia ==
* At 13:29 UTC (8 minutes before the compilation of the client.jar file for this version) there were reports on IRC about a new update<ref>Scaevolus' #risucraft IRC logs{{tag|nocat=1|link pending}}: 13:30:45 <crow> Minecraft last updated on Tue, 19 Apr 2011 13:29:14 GMT</ref><ref>[https://kealper.com/irclogs/2011-04-19 Kealper IRC logs]: [09:32] <_303> 1.5 is out</ref>, but it has not been confirmed whether that version was a reupload of the [[Java Edition Beta 1.4_01|previous version]] or a pre-reupload of this version.
