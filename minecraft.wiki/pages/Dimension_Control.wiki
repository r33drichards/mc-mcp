'''Dimension control''' is a block added in the [[25w14craftmine]] update that lets the player change the dimension's [[sky box]].

== Obtaining ==
The dimension control can be found by unlocking a [[shimmering door]] with a [[shimmering key]], which has a chance to be a boiler room depending on the key. Inside an iron bar cage is the dimension control and a chest with seven [[sky box]]es.
=== Breaking ===
No tool can accelerate the breaking process of the dimension control. It drops itself when destroyed.

== Usage ==
Right clicking on the dimension control opens a GUI with the [[sky box]] of the current dimension already inside. If a different skybox is inserted that skybox will replace the sky of the dimension. If no skybox is inside the dimension control then the sky will be solid black.

== Trivia ==
* The dimension control uses the texture of a [[crafting table]], and when placed down uses the same blue shimmering that [[shimmering door]]s use.
