'''''Docktor''''' is a game created by [[Mojang]] for the [[Humble Bundle Games Against Ebola]] game jam.

== Gameplay ==

The player controls a ship in space, which is continously running out of fuel. Their goal is to keep the ship fueled for as long as it's possible. Replenishing fuel is accomplished by moving asteroids close to the dock using a harpoon. The dock will consume nearby asteroids, which refuels the ship and increases the size of the dock. The indicators of fuel, as well as the time the player survived so far are located on the top of the screen.

Running out of fuel or getting out of range (indicated by a red line on the map) will end the game, with the total time survived displayed on the end screen.

=== Controls ===

The game is played with a gamepad.

* Left-right on {{Psbutton|thumb-right}}: Rotate
* {{Psbutton|thumb-left}}: Move
* Up or down on {{Psbutton|thumb-right}}: Shoot harpoon
* {{Psbutton|3dpad-up}}, {{Psbutton|3dpad-down}}, {{Psbutton|3dpad-left}}, {{Psbutton|3dpad-right}}, {{Psbutton|3l2}} or {{Psbutton|3r2}}: Retract harpoon

* {{Psbutton|3r1}}: Zoom in

* {{Psbutton|3circle}}: Spawn small asteroid

== Trivia ==

* The controls to spawn asteroids appear to be a debug feature, as it allows to easily cheat through the game.
* Movement of the ship seems to be buggy, causing the game to be nearly unplayable.
