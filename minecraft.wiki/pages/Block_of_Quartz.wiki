A '''block of quartz''', internally known as a '''quartz block''', is a mineral [[block]] used for decoration. It can be turned into a [[Quartz Slab|quartz slab]], [[chiseled quartz block]], [[quartz pillar]], [[quartz bricks]], or [[smooth quartz block]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Blocks of quartz can be [[breaking|mined]] using any [[pickaxe]]. If mined without a pickaxe, it [[drops]] nothing.

=== Natural generation ===
Four quartz blocks generate naturally as part of each bridge in the [[bastion remnant]].

== Usage ==
Quartz blocks cannot be used to store [[Nether quartz]] because they cannot be [[craft]]ed back into it, unlike blocks made from other [[ore]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-6797|||WAI}}</ref>

== Issues ==
{{Issue list|Block of Quartz|Quartz Block}}

== Trivia ==
* Because of the low blast resistance of regular quartz blocks, it may be preferable to use two quartz slabs or smooth quartz blocks when making fortifications using quartz, as their blast resistance is higher than the other quartz block variants.
* In real life, a 1-cubic-meter block of quartz (the size of a Minecraft block) is practically harder than the real life [[block of iron]], while the hardness of a block of quartz in Minecraft is quite low.
