'''16w39a''' is the seventh [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.11]], released on September 28, 2016.<ref name="blogpost_16w39a">https://www.mojang.com/2016/09/minecraft-snapshot-16w39a-the-exploration-update/</ref>

== Additions ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[File:Observer JE1.png|32px]] [[Observer]]s'''
* Ported from the ''[[Pocket]]'' and ''[[Windows 10]]'' editions.
** Has slight behavior differences due to how [[redstone]] works in the ''Java Edition'' compared to Pocket and Windows 10 Edition.
*** Check the observer page for said differences.
* Outputs a redstone signal when it detects a block update.
** Normal BUDs still remain.

'''{{Animate|White Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Light Gray Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Gray Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Black Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Brown Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Red Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Orange Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Yellow Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Lime Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Green Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Cyan Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Light Blue Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Blue Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Purple Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Magenta Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png; Pink Shulker Box JE1 BE1.png|32px}} [[Shulker box]]es'''
* Crafted in a [[crafting table]] as a single column, with a [[chest]] in the middle row and a [[shulker shell]] both above and below the chest.
** In this snapshot, there is a bug that makes the [[player]] unable to craft it in the right and left columns.
* Works similar to a chest, but keeps its content when broken.
** If it has any content inside, it drops itself in [[Creative]] mode as well.
** Cannot be placed inside another shulker box.
** When hovered over in the inventory, it shows up to 5 slots of its content.
** Breaks when being pushed by a piston.
* Uses the same opening and closing animations as the [[shulker]].
* Can be placed on different sides of a block to open in different directions.
** When opening, its hitbox changes from 1 block to 1.5 blocks in its opening direction.
*** Because of this, it doesn't open if there is a block of any kind within the closest half-block area in its opening direction.
* Can be [[dye]]d in any of the available dye colors.
** Dyed shulker boxes have a slightly darker bottom part than the normal one.
** In this snapshot, there is a bug with obtaining the dyed versions, so currently it is only possible to get them through Creative or commands.
* Dispensers can place the block on the ground.
* Can be mined with anything, but is mined faster with a [[pickaxe]].

=== Items ===
'''[[Spawn egg]]s'''
* [[File:Llama Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Llama]]s
* [[File:Evoker Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Evoker]]s
* [[File:Vex Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Vex]]es
* [[File:Vindicator Spawn Egg JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Vindicator]]s

'''[[File:Shulker Shell JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Shulker shell]]s'''
* Has a 50% chance of being dropped by a [[shulker]] upon death.
* Crafted together with a [[chest]] in a column to make [[shulker box]]es.

'''[[File:Totem of Undying JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Totems of undying]]'''
* [[Evoker]]s always drop one of these upon death.
* Holding it in either hand when the [[player]] dies activates it and saves their life.
** Gives players the Absorption and Regeneration effects when activated.
** Does not prevent death by {{cmd|kill}} or the [[void]].
** Has an animation when activated, which uses the item's texture and model.

'''[[File:Village Map JE1.png|32px]] [[Explorer map]]s'''
* Can only be obtained from cartographer villagers.
* Used to locate [[ocean monument]]s and the new [[woodland mansion]]s.
** Ocean explorer maps are slightly blue, while woodland explorer maps are slightly brown.
* Works like a map, but shows the outlines of land and a single structure icon.
** Fills in the map with blocks once the [[player]] starts exploring the area shown.
* When resized, it still shows the structure icon, but loses the outlines.
* When outside the area on the map, the player icon is smaller the further away the player is.
** When 1024 blocks away from the structure, the dot changes from a small icon to a bigger one.

=== Mobs ===
'''[[File:Creamy Llama.png|32px]] [[Llama]]s'''
* Spawn in [[extreme hills]].
* Drop [[leather]].
* Have multiple skins, like [[cat]]s and [[horse]]s.
* Attack by spitting.
** If the [[player]] hits them, llamas spit at the player once, dealing {{Health|1}} damage.
** If not in a caravan group, they are always aggressive toward [[wolves]].
* Can be equipped with a carpet for decoration and a chest for storage.
** Differently colored carpets have different textures when placed on llamas.
** The amount of storage slots available depends on the strength of the llama.
* If the player puts a leash on one, up to 10 llamas are attracted and try to form a caravan.
** Caravan groups are passive to all mobs.
* Tamed llamas can be bred with [[hay bale]]s.

'''[[Illager]]s'''
* Being relatives to the [[villager]]s, they look similar but have pale gray skin and wear dark clothes.
* Two kinds of illagers are introduced: [[evoker]]s and [[vindicator]]s.

'''[[File:Vindicator JE1.png|32px]] [[Vindicator]]s'''
* Separate their arms when aggravated, and hold an [[iron axe]] in their main hand.
* Hostile towards [[player]]s and [[villager]]s.
* If given the name <code>Johnny</code> they attack any nearby mobs, with the exception of other illagers.
* Spawn in the [[woodland mansion]]s upon generation. They don't respawn.
* May drop [[emerald]]s and an [[iron axe]] upon death.

'''[[File:Evoker JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Evoker]]s'''

'''[[File:Evoker Fangs JE1 BE1.png|32px]] [[Evocation fangs]]'''
* Are summoned by the evoker when they perform their fang attack.
* There are two kinds of offensive bite and defensive bite.
* Fangs in warmup still have a visible [[hitbox]].
* Damages {{hp|6}} deals to mobs that were in place.
* Naturally spawned fangs do not harm illagers.
** But player-spawned ones do.

=== World generation ===
'''{{EnvLink|End gateway|Return portal}}'''
* Teleport the [[player]] to the main island's spawn platform.
* Generate randomly throughout [[the End]]'s outer islands.

'''{{EnvLink|Woodland Mansion|Woodland Mansion}}'''
* Generate in [[roofed forest]] biomes.
* Home to the [[illager]]s.
* Have three floors, where the bottom two are larger and the third is smaller.
* Use procedural generation and [[structure block]]s for random layouts.
** Because of this, some rooms may be completely surrounded by walls and have no entrance.
* Consist mostly of [[cobblestone]], [[dark oak planks]], and blocks crafted from them.
* Can be located with a [[woodland explorer map]]s.

=== Gameplay ===
'''Curses'''
* Enchantments with negative effects.
* Two curses added: the [[Curse of Binding]] (enchantment ID 10) and the [[Curse of Vanishing]] (enchantment ID 71).
** Curse of Binding binds the item to the player, making them unable to drop it or take it off if it is an armor item, although it drops when they die. Players in Creative mode are unaffected by this curse.
** Curse of Vanishing makes the item disappear if the player dies. <code>/gamerule keepInventory true</code> prevents this.
* Cursed tools, armor and books can be found as loot in some generated structures.

=== Command format ===
'''{{cmd|locate}}'''
* Syntax: {{cmd|locate <StructureType>}}
** Accepts: <code>EndCity</code>, <code>Fortress</code>, <code>Mansion</code>, <code>Mineshaft</code>, <code>Monument</code>, <code>Stronghold</code>, <code>Temple</code> and <code>Village</code>.
** Desert temples, jungle temples, witch huts and igloos all go under the <code>Temple</code> category.
* Pushes coordinates for the closest structure of given type in the chat for the player who executed the command.
** Returns the message "Located [Structure] at [x] [y] [z]".
** Displays the Y coordinates as "(y?)" for some structures.
** If a structure is not located nearby (i.e. in a different dimension), it responds with "Unable to locate any [StructureType] feature."

=== General ===
'''[[Old Customized|Customized world generation]]'''
* Added an option to disable the generation of woodland mansions.

'''[[Particles]]'''
* <code>spit</code>
** Used when [[llama]]s spit.
* <code>totem</code>
** Used when the [[totem of undying]] is activated.

'''[[NBT format]]'''
* New display tag entry for items: {{nbt|string|LocName}} for translation strings.
* {{nbt|int|CustomPotionColor}} integer tag for potions and potion arrows to overwrite/set the color.
* {{nbt|int|ColorMap}} integer tag for filled maps to overwrite/set the color of the marks in the item texture.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
[[File:End Gateway JE2 BE1.png|width=32x32]] '''[[End Gateway (block)|End Gateway Blocks]]'''
* Now use a magenta-colored beam when teleporting entities, rather than yellow.
