== Description ==
These hills were no taller than most other hill biomes in the game, despite the name 'mountains'. As a hills variant, the biome was almost similar to the [[Snowy Plains|snowy plains]]. However, [[River|rivers]] generated inside this biome were not replaced by [[Frozen River|frozen rivers]]. No structures generated in this biome, though polar bears, rabbits and strays spawned. Caves frequently generated on the sides of the mountains. {{IN|Bedrock}}, no hostile mobs other than strays, skeletons and slimes spawned here.

== Mobs ==
Snowy mountains used the same mob spawning chances as snowy plains.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
