The '''modified jungle''' or '''jungle mutated''' was a rare variant of the [[jungle]] that no longer generates since [[Caves & Cliffs: Part II]], and was removed in ''Java Edition''.

== Description ==
The modified jungle featured much more mountainous terrain, being taller and steeper than [[Jungle Hills|jungle hills]]. Overhangs, ravines, floating islands, and large cliffs were very common here. The heights, combined with the thick foliage, rendered the ground below almost entirely out of sight. The folliage was similar to the jungle biome. [[Ocelot|Ocelots]], [[Parrot|parrots]], and [[Panda|pandas]] spawned in this biome, but [[Jungle Pyramid|jungle pyramids]] didn't generate here.

With [[Vibrant Visuals]], modified jungles use a strong humid [[Fog#Volumetric fog|volumetric fog]] setting, which fades the distance in an orange tint. Modified jungles have warm atmospherics, lighting, and color grading, which makes the biome look more humid and warm.

== Mobs ==
{{IN|Java}}, modified jungles used the same mob spawning chances as jungle hills for hostile and ambient categories, and had different chances for passive categories, while {{in|Bedrock}}, modified jungles used the same mob spawning chances as jungles.

The following mobs spawned naturally here:
