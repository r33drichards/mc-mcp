'''Beta 1.6 Test Build 3''' is a version used to test [[Java Edition Beta 1.6]] the day before its release. It was never officially released to the public; however, both the client and the server are packed in an archive that can be found on the legacy update server.<ref>https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/prerelease/build.zip ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150826024721/https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/prerelease/build.zip Archive])</ref> This is the first and only known test build released in 2011.

=== Blocks ===
'''General'''
* Blocks destroyed by other players in multiplayer now show the breaking block particle effect.

'''[[Dispenser]]s'''
* Now make sounds and particles in multiplayer when activated.

'''[[Door]]s'''
* Now make sound for other players in multiplayer.

'''[[Mushroom]]s'''
* Now spread, albeit slowly.

'''[[Lighting]]'''
* The lighting on block icons in the inventory has been changed to appear brighter.

'''[[Player]]s'''
* When stuck in walls, slide towards the nearest gap if there is one.

=== General ===
'''[[Control]]s'''
* {{key|Shift}}+clicking while crafting makes as much as possible and moves it straight to the player's inventory.
* {{key|Shift}}+clicking something in the player's inventory pushes it directly in the player's hotbar and vice-versa.

'''Network traffic'''
* Compressed network traffic more aggressively.

'''[[Texture pack]]s'''
* Added support for <code>misc\grasscolor.png</code> and <code>misc\foliagecolor.png</code> images.

=== World generation ===
* A line of 11 chests generates near the spawn point, containing all the blocks and items with unique IDs. These include blocks and items that are normally unobtainable, but exclude data value variants (such as colored wool or charcoal). The game ''always'' generates a line of 11 chests, but some of them are sometimes placed at Y=0, making the line on the surface seem incomplete. The content of the chests is the following:

== Trivia ==
* <!--The previous Beta 1.6 Test Builds (1 & 2) were released privately.{{cn}} Beta 1.6 Test Build 3 was accidentally released to the public.-->
* Advanced OpenGL is enabled by default in this version. In [[Beta 1.6]] Advanced OpenGL was removed temporarily until [[Beta 1.6.5]] due to bugs.
** Advanced OpenGL crashes [[Minecraft]] on some computers.
* Picking up multiple stacks of items takes a few ticks to finish, unlike the final version where it only takes one.
* The fix for the crash when riding a vehicle or animal through a nether portal is done differently.{{Verify|type=change|edition=java|In what way?}}
* Session requests are performed over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
** Session requests fail on any code other than HTTP 200, instead of only with HTTP 400.
* Connection to the server is closed differently; no thread is used in this build.
* GL state when rendering items is not properly reset, which may lead to graphical artifacts.{{Verify|type=change|edition=java|In what way?}}
* Tall grass renders differently:

=== Validity ===
While modern versions of ''Minecraft'' are hosted on <code>s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download</code>, this version is hosted on <code>s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload</code> (without the period). At first it may seem that this site is not owned by [[Mojang Studios]], but it can be verified as Mojang-owned in several ways:

* The legacy ''Minecraft'' [[launcher]] (from 2013) uses this site to update, which can be verified through a decompiler.
* [[Java Edition Classic]] was loaded from <code>s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/classic/minecraft.jar</code> when it could still be accessed on [[minecraft.net]].<ref>While the page for classic is no longer accessible, [http://web.archive.org/web/20150910183326/https://minecraft.net/classic/play archived versions] do include this link.</ref></onlyinclude>
