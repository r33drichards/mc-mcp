== Changes ==

* Uses [http://netty.io/ Netty] now.
* Most packets won't change. 
** Handshake and ping procedure is being redone.
* There is a packet length header.

'''[[Server list]]'''
* Reworked the list.
* Added server icons.
* Lists the current players on a server when you hover over the player number.
* Added support for multi-line MOTD comments.
* Removed support for MOTD comments going offscreen.
* Reset the protocol version.

'''[[Video settings]]'''
* Changes to the menu.

== Removals ==
=== General ===
'''[[Java Edition distance effects/Historical effects|Distance effects]]'''
* [[Item frame]]s no longer follow the camera and jitter with camera rotation at extreme coordinates.
* [[Painting]]s also no longer follow the camera and jitter with camera rotation at extreme coordinates.
* Fixed a desynchronisation issue that appeared at high coordinates; this varied depending on hardware.
** In some cases, this simply caused entities, water, ice and the wireframe block outline box to appear slightly desynchronised from the world itself. However, in others, the former grouping would jitter severely.

== Trivia ==
* [[13w41b]] has the same protocol version as 13w41a, but they are not compatible with each other.
* 13w41a was previously removed from the [[launcher]] for some time, but was added back in September 2018.
