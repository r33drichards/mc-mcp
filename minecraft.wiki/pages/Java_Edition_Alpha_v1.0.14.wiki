'''Alpha v1.0.14''', also known as '''Seecret Friday 7''', is a version of [[Java Edition Alpha]] released on July 30, 2010. It is the seventh [[seecret update]]. It added [[chicken]]s, [[egg]]s, [[jukebox]]es, [[music disc]]s, [[minecarts with furnaces]], [[minecarts with chests]] and new splashes, and re-added music.

Two main different versions of Alpha v1.0.14 exist. Only the second is available in the launcher. The reupload fixed the jukebox recipe giving a [[bookshelf]] in the pre-reupload version and added the splash "Switches and ores!".

== Trivia ==
* The blog post for Alpha v1.0.15 is mislabeled as being for "Minecraft Alpha v1.0.14".<ref>{{link|url=https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/archive/alpha/alpha-survival-single-player/800775-alpha-1-0-15|title=Alpha 1.0.15?|author=Darerd11|website=Minecraft Forum|date=August 3, 2010}}</ref> The date of the jar and the timestamp of the post both show that it is Alpha v1.0.15 instead.
* In the pre-reupload version, the jukebox crafting recipe was wrong. It gave bookshelves.
