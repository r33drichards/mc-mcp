'''24w35a''' is the third [[snapshot]] for [[Java Edition 1.21.2]], released on August 28, 2024.<ref>{{snap|24w35a|August 28, 2024}}</ref> It contains improvements to bundle interactions, as well as some technical changes and bug fixes.

== Changes ==
=== Blocks ===
'''[[Bee nest]]s and [[beehive]]s'''
* Now show information about their level of honey and number of [[bee]]s.
* Now use their "full" texture when held or in the inventory, and they are at max level of honey.

=== Gameplay ===
'''[[Raid]]s'''
* Raiders must find a place to spawn no more than 96 blocks vertically above or below the village center, or a raid cannot start.
* It is now much less likely for raiders to not find a valid place to spawn when raiding.

=== General ===
'''[[Data pack]]s'''
* The [[pack format]] version is now <code>51</code>.
** [[Trial spawner]] configurations in fields <code>normal_config</code> and <code>ominous_config</code> are now defined in registry <code>trial_spawner</code>.
*** This allows for easier customization of trial spawner configurations in data packs.
*** Inlined configuration data is still supported.
** Entities' rotation on the x axis is now clamped between -90 and 90.
** {{cmd|loot}} command now returns an error when trying to drop from a block without a loot table (like [[air]]).
** The <code>cooldownGroup</code> field in <code>food</code> item stack component has been renamed to <code>cooldown_group</code>.

'''[[Loot table]]s'''
* Special loot table empty has been removed and is no longer defined in vanilla data pack.
* Sheep now always uses a single loot table <code>entities/sheep</code>.
* Wool drops are still defined in sub-tables in <code>entities/sheep/{{ph|color}}</code>, but they are now just dispatched from the main table.
** Note: mutton drop is now controlled by the main table, while sub-tables are responsible only for wool drop.
* Sheep shearing is now controlled by loot table found as <code>shearing/sheep</code>.
* Mooshroom shearing is now controlled by loot table found as <code>shearing/mooshroom</code>.

'''[[Predicate]]'''
* New entity sub-predicate for testing sheep wool.
** Fields:
*** <code>sheared</code> - optional boolean.
*** <code>color</code> - optional wool dye color.

== Experimental ==
'''[[Bundle]]s '''
* The number keys can no longer be used to select items in a bundle.
* The bundle fullness bar and its fill color now have new separate textures that can be overridden in a resource pack.
