'''Can a Mojang Employee Survive the Night in a REAL Forest?''' is a comedic skit presented at [[MINECON Earth 2017]], revolving around a [[Mojang Studios]] employee attempting to survive in a real forest.

== Summary ==
<onlyinclude>Beginning in footage of a [[taiga]] [[biome]], a narrator discusses how ''[[Minecraft]]'' is more than a game about creativity, but survival. They then ask the question, how would one of the people behind the game fare in a real world situation? The employee selected for the initiative is [[Marsh Davies]], who introduces himself and claims he's "the least likely to survive." He intends to prove them wrong, boasting that he plays ''Minecraft'' and thus knows everything about survival. To assist him in his quest, Marsh is handed a backpack of supplies, but unfortunately, said supplies are various pieces of ''Minecraft'' merchandise.

As he embarks into the wilderness, the stakes are established; he's several miles away from civilization, in the "{{Wikipedia|Sweden|Swedish}} forests." His first thought is to build a shelter, contemplating [[Breaking|punching]] a [[tree]]. Instead, he decides to use a Styrofoam [[Iron Axe|iron axe]], and on a small shrub as opposed to a full tree. Venturing farther into the woods, he overhears the squeals of a pig, and begins hunting it down. He pulls out a [[bow]], using it to fire an [[arrow]], both fake. It fails to land him anything, despite functioning as an actual bow.

Later, sitting under a tree with a fidget spinner, he overhears a wolf howl. Hoping to prevent any injuries, he pulls out a [[Diamond Sword|diamond sword]] and hunts down the wolf. This time, he successfully finds it on a large rock, however he flees at the mere sight of it. The time jumps to the next day, the narrator arriving to check in on Marsh. He's found sleeping in a blanket, with his "equipment" scattered. He flees at the mere sight of the narrator, rushing over to a car to get back to civilization as quickly as possible.</onlyinclude>

== Quotes ==
{{Quote|Here at Mojang, we wanted to see if our Minecraft skills would make us better at surviving in real forests. So we voted to see who was the Mojang employee least likely to survive one night in the wild. The result? Marsh! The tools? Minecraft merch! How did he fare? Not great!|Video description}}

== Trivia ==

* Among Marsh's "survival equipment" is a copy of [[Minecraft: The Island|''Minecraft: The Island'']].
* The video claims ''Minecraft'' players have to build everything from scratch, and distinguish Marsh by giving him a backpack of supplies. This was not the case when the video was created, as the [[Bonus Chest|bonus chest]] had already been established.
