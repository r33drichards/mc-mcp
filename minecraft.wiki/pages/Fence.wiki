[[File:All Fences.png|thumb|All fences.]]
A '''fence''' is a barrier block that cannot normally be jumped over, similar to a [[wall]]. Unlike a wall, a player (but not [[mobs]]) can see through the openings in a fence.

== Usage ==
=== Barrier ===
[[File:FenceConnectivity.png|thumb|right|Wooden fences and Nether brick fences connected by fence gates. Notice that they do not form a connection directly between the two types of fences (in the middle).]]
While fences appear to be a single block tall and have a hitbox height of one block, their collision box (for entities) is 1.5 [[blocks tall]], meaning most mobs cannot jump over them without the [[Jump Boost]] status effect. They are transparent to light and have visual gaps in the model. [[Spider]]s can climb over a fence, just like any other vertical object. [[Camel]]s can walk over fences.

A fence occupies the center space of blocks and automatically connects to any [[solid block]] that is placed next to it. Wooden fences connect to other wooden fences, but do not connect to Nether brick fences. However, Nether brick fences connect to wooden [[Fence Gate|fence gate]]s.<ref>{{bug|MC-197992}}</ref> Mobs cannot pass between Nether brick fences and wooden fences, although players can.

Additionally, if a [[carpet]], [[trapdoor]], [[moss carpet]] or [[pale moss carpet]] is placed above a fence, players are able to jump over the fence while other mobs are unable to, including mobs like zombies with similar attributes to players.

=== Leads ===

Fences can be used to attach mobs with a [[lead]].

== Issues ==
{{issue list}}

== Trivia ==
*If a [[carpet]] is placed on top of a fence, a player can jump onto the carpet, while mobs cannot (except [[rabbit]]s).
**Placing a carpet on top of a fence does not reduce the fence or wall collision box down to one block, it just provides a platform one block high around the fence/wall to make it easier for climbing on the top of the fence.
*Getting hit by someone else (or shooting themselves with a Punch enchanted bow while sprinting forward) while in midair can cause the knockback to propel the player over a fence they would not be able to jump over normally.
*Projectiles get stuck in the collision box of the fence and remain there if shot from above.
