'''Zombified piglins''' are neutral, [[undead]] variants of [[piglin]]s that inhabit [[the Nether]]. Zombified piglins normally ignore [[player]]s, but if one is attacked, it and all zombified piglins in the vicinity become enraged and attack the aggressor. If, however, the attacked zombified piglin is killed in one hit, others won't become enraged.

== Spawning ==
Zombified piglins can spawn in several methods:
* In [[Nether wastes]] and [[crimson forest]] biomes, and [[Nether fortress]]es in [[the Nether]].
* When a [[strider]] spawns as a [[strider jockey]].
* From [[Nether portal]]s in the [[Overworld]].
** They spawn directly in the portal, meaning they do not require other mobs to go through the portal.
** Mobs going through a Nether portal are not considered "spawning" of any kind.
* When struck by [[lightning]], [[pig]]s transform into zombified piglins.
* From [[piglin]]s or [[piglin brute]]s zombifying in the [[Overworld]] or [[the End]].
** Zombification takes 15 seconds and starts as soon as the mob enters the dimension.
** The zombified piglin will retain any equipment that piglin or piglin brute had.
* As reinforcements from other zombified piglins.{{only|java|short=1}}

They have a 5% chance of spawning as baby zombified piglins. Zombified piglins do not spawn naturally on top of [[Nether wart block]]s. Like other naturally fireproof mobs, they can spawn on [[magma block]]s.

Zombified piglins do not spawn in [[Peaceful]] mode.

{{Mob spawn table}}

=== Equipment ===
95% of zombified piglins spawn with a [[golden sword]], which has up to a 25% chance of being enchanted in Normal or Hard [[difficulty]]. This chance varies depending on the [[regional difficulty]]. The sword's enchantment is from 5 to 23 levels.

5% of zombified piglins spawn with a [[golden spear]], which may be enchanted. They will use the jab attack if provoked. They can also use the charge attack when riding on a strider.

{{IN|java}}, on [[wikipedia:Halloween|Halloween]] (October 31), zombified piglins have a 22.5% chance of spawning with a [[carved pumpkin]] or a 2.5% chance of spawning with a [[jack o'lantern]] equipped as headgear. This is not dropped, even if killed with [[Looting]].

=== Chicken jockey ===
{{Exclusive|section=1|Java}}
Baby zombified piglins can spawn as a [[chicken jockey]], with the following probability:

* A baby zombified piglin has a chance of 9.75% to spawn as a chicken jockey if a chicken is present within a 5×3×5 block area centered on the spawn attempt location (5% to use the chicken nearby + 4.75% of summoning a new chicken).
* A baby zombified piglin has a 4.75% chance of spawning as a chicken jockey if no chicken is present within a 5×3×5 area.
** The combined chance of a zombified piglin independently spawning as a baby chicken jockey is 0.2375%.

=== Nether biomes and fortresses ===
Zombified piglins spawn in [[the Nether]] at light level 11 and below on most blocks other than [[Nether wart block]]s. They spawn most commonly in [[Nether wastes]] in groups of 4, frequently in [[Nether fortress]]es in groups of 4, and uncommonly in [[crimson forest]]s in groups of 2-4. {{IN|Bedrock}}, zombified piglins spawn in groups of 2-4 on both [[Nether waste]]s and [[crimson forest]]s and individually on [[Nether fortress]]es. 

=== Strider jockey ===
{{main|Strider Jockey}}
When an adult [[strider]] spawns, it has a 3.3% chance of spawning being ridden by a zombified piglin holding a [[warped fungus on a stick]]. The zombified piglin does not count towards the mob cap and does not despawn. {{IN|je}}, the zombified piglin has a 5% chance to spawn as a baby.

=== Nether portals ===
When a [[Nether portal block]] in the [[Overworld]] receives a [[random tick]], there is a chance of {{frac|1|2000}} (0.05%) on Easy, {{frac|1|1000}} (0.1%) on Normal and {{frac|3|2000}} (0.15%) on Hard for it to spawn a zombified piglin.

{{IN|java}}, they appear inside one of the portal blocks on the bottom. Zombified piglins who spawn in this way cannot travel to [[the Nether]] for a preset amount of time, whether they walk through the portal they spawned in or through nearby portals.

{{IN|bedrock}}, they spawn one block to the east or south of the portal (depending on which direction the portal is facing). Neither [[slab]]s nor lighting prevents this. Every portal block is immediately ticked when the portal is first activated; therefore, if a large portal is repeatedly activated and deactivated, zombified piglins can spawn rapidly<ref>{{bug|MCPE-98020}}</ref>. However, portals at negative heights do not spawn zombified piglins at all.

Zombified piglins spawning via this process is completely independent of the [[mob cap]], similar to the spawning of [[phantom]]s {{in|Java}}, which means they can still spawn if there are a sufficient number of hostile mobs in the world.

=== Pigs ===
A zombified piglin spawns when [[lightning]] strikes within 4 blocks of a [[pig]], up to 8 blocks down, and up to 4 blocks up, regardless of any obstruction between the pig and where the lightning strikes. If the pig is a piglet, it then transforms into a baby zombified piglin. 

=== Piglins ===
A [[piglin]] or [[piglin brute]] that enters the [[Overworld]] or [[the End]] transforms into a zombified piglin after 15 seconds. When piglins wielding [[crossbow]]s zombify, they keep their crossbows, but are unable to use them, and perform melee attacks like other zombified piglins. When baby piglins zombify, they do not have weapons, unlike baby zombified piglins that naturally spawn. When piglin brutes zombify, they keep their axes.

The newly zombified piglin gets the [[Nausea]] effect for 10 seconds. This is a purely visual effect, and does not affect the mob's behavior.

A zombified piglin keeps any armor or weapons collected before being zombified{{only|java|short=1}}.

Baby zombified piglins also have a 5% chance of becoming a chicken jockey{{only|java}}.

If a piglin is in the middle of bartering and gets zombified while inspecting a gold ingot, it drops the ingot when it turns into a zombified piglin.

=== Reinforcements ===
{{main|Zombie#Reinforcements 2|title1=Zombie § Reinforcements}}{{exclusive|Java|section=1}}
Unlike other zombie variants, only leader zombified piglins can spawn reinforcements.<ref>{{bug|MC-301000}}</ref>

On [[Hard]] difficulty, up to 5% zombified piglins of zombified piglins may spawn as a leader, which have a 50–75% plus 0–10% <!-- this makes the distribution have bias; please don't change to simply 50–85% --> chance to spawn other zombified piglins as reinforcements when receiving [[damage]] while targeting an [[entity]].

* There is an 8.5%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 25%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} chance to drop their original weapon if killed by a player or tamed [[wolf]]. The chance is increased by 1%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 5%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} per level of Looting, for a maximum of 11.5%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 40%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} with Looting III. The death animation does not include the weapon if it was dropped.

* After a piglin transforms into a zombified piglin, it drops any acquired armor and held weapons upon death.
* {{xp|5}} for adults or {{xp|12}} for babies if killed by a player or a tamed [[wolf]].
** An additional {{xp|1|3}} for each equipment it does ''not'' drop upon death.
** Additionally, {{in|be}}, zombified piglins that have spawned riding [[strider]]s don't drop any experience.

== Behavior ==
Zombified piglins wander aimlessly about when idle. They move at 2.28&nbsp;m/s and are immune to [[fire]] and [[lava]]. When provoked, their speed increases to 3.38&nbsp;m/s or faster for babies.

{{IN|java}}, like [[zombie]]s, some zombified piglins can attack [[wooden door|wooden]] and [[copper door]]s and may break them on Hard difficulty.<ref>{{bug|MC-62048}} marked 'Works As Intended'</ref> 

In Normal and Hard difficulties, up to 55%{{Only|java|short=y}} or 25%{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} of zombified piglins can pick up any [[armor]] pieces and [[sword]]s better than their golden one, which they always drop when killed. This also prevents them from despawning. 

{{IN|bedrock}}, zombified piglins may pick up an [[ominous banner]] next to it as [[pillager]]s do.<ref>{{bug|MCPE-89730}}</ref>

Zombified piglins try to destroy any [[turtle egg]]s they see within 23 blocks away horizontally and 3 blocks away vertically (10 blocks horizontally and 2 blocks vertically {{in|bedrock}}), not counting the block they are standing in. When a zombified piglin is first spawned, it always detects nearby turtle eggs after exactly 2 seconds, as long as there are two blocks of air above it. However, if the turtle egg is placed after the zombified piglin spawned, the zombified piglin takes some time to notice the turtle egg and try to break it. Unlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack baby [[turtle]]s.

Zombified piglins avoid walking near [[magma block]]s and cannot jump over magma blocks one block high. If a zombified piglin is surrounded by magma block wall one block height or higher, it gets near those surrounding magma blocks surrounding them. If a zombified piglin spawns on or is pushed onto magma blocks, it pathfinds normally on the magma.

Zombified piglins do not retreat from [[zoglin]]s, soul torches, soul lanterns, soul fire, or soul campfires. Zoglins attack zombified piglins on sight, causing a retaliation.

Zombified piglins are not distracted by gold and cannot barter, unlike piglins. They also do not follow players that are holding a gold ingot or another gold item.

[[Wandering trader]]s run away from zombified piglins, despite them being passive to them.{{Only|bedrock|short=y}} In addition, piglins squeal in distress and flee from zombified piglins if they get too close. Zombified piglins ignore piglins unless provoked.

[[Iron golem]]s attack zombified piglins, which causes other zombified piglins to attack the iron golem. A zombified piglin is neutral to every mob that can attack, but they retaliate and gang up on any mob that provokes them.

=== Mounting ===
{{In development|be|3=26.0|section=1}}
15% of naturally spawned baby zombified piglins can start riding a mob and become a [[jockey]] when it tries attacking. A jockey mob ridden by a baby zombified piglin will adapt to the speed of its rider. A baby zombified piglin can ride:{{columns-list|* {{EntitySprite|Chicken}} Adult [[chicken]]s

Due to an unreported bug, baby zombified piglins that are supposed to be jockeys spawn as an adult that drops no experience upon death.<ref>https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/blob/493f4ffc613f7335a2a7591971d6971f210aa049/behavior_pack/entities/zombie_pigman.json#L521C1-L521C43 - This is because of a [[spawn event]] not existing in the {{cd|events}} object in the zombified piglin's [[JSON]] file.</ref>

=== Mob type ===
Being an [[undead]] mob, they are: 
* damaged by the status effect [[Instant Health]] and healed by the status effect [[Instant Damage]].
* unaffected by the status effects [[Regeneration]] and [[Poison]].
* ignored by the [[wither]].
* affected by the [[Smite]] enchantment.
* unable to swim in [[water]], but do not drown.
* a threat to [[armadillo]]s, causing them to hide in their shell.

=== Hostility ===
Zombified piglins are not initially hostile, but all zombified piglins within a 67×22×67 to 111×22×111 area<!-- The horizontal "radius" is followRange: base value is 35, ±5% random spawn bonus (it's a Gaussian distribution, so it can be greater but unlikely, less than 20% chance), then plus 0–50% random zombie-spawn bonus (depend on the local difficulty, under 3 there is no bonus, over 4 there is 33% chance for a bonus with linear distribution of that bonus).

The vertical radius is 10 blocks, with an additional block because the zombified piglins are 2 blocks tall. -->{{only|java|short=1}} or a 20-block radius{{only|bedrock|short=1}} centered on an attacked zombified piglin become aggressive and converge on the attacker (another mob or player, except [[goats]] and [[ghast]]s) if any individual is attacked, unless the zombified piglin attacked is killed in one hit.<ref>{{bug|MC-2432|||WAI}}</ref> They make an aggressive sound when angered. In addition, some zombified piglins have the ability to spawn reinforcements when attacked ([[Zombie#Reinforcements|similar to zombies]]).{{only|java|short=1}} This applies to any hit registered as coming from the player or other mobs, including deflected [[ghast]] fireballs, [[sword|sweep attacks]], snowballs and eggs, [[firework]]s shot from [[crossbow]]s, TNT, [[wind charge]]s, and skeleton arrows. Arrows shot from dispensers or [[bed]] explosions<ref>{{bug|MC-208880}}</ref> don't provoke zombified piglins.

A zombified piglin can remain hostile indefinitely if it is both within the follow range of the zombified piglin (33 to 55 blocks) and has a direct line of sight to the player. However, breaking one of those conditions causes a hostile zombified piglin to return to being neutral after a "forgiveness timer" expires. {{IN|java}}, this timer ranges from 20 seconds to 55 seconds<!-- This timer is 20 seconds to 40 seconds if the player is out of the follow range. There is an additional 15 seconds added if the player is out of sight but in range. -->, whereas {{in|bedrock}} it is always 25 seconds. The forgiveness timer does ''not'' advance for zombified piglins in unloaded chunks. Therefore, if the player enters a [[Nether portal]] and returns, any provoked zombified piglins in the area remain aggressive (unless another player was nearby to keep the chunks loaded). A player's death causes zombified piglins to become neutral toward the player if the gamerule <code>forgiveDeadPlayers</code> (true by default) is true.{{only|java|short=1}} 

A hostile zombified piglin can also "sound an alarm", spreading the aggro to all zombified piglins within a 67×22×67 to 111×22×111 area <!-- Same as when hit. -->{{only|java|short=1}} or 20-block{{only|bedrock|short=1}} radius. A hostile zombified piglin does this whenever the targeted player is within their follow range (33 to 55 blocks) and has a constant line-of-sight with its target, then it does the same every 4–6 seconds (80-120 game ticks), recruiting any formerly-neutral peers. They pursue players even if they have the [[Invisibility]] effect.

{{IN|bedrock}}, a nearby neutral zombified piglin prevents a player from sleeping, as if it were a hostile mob.

Hostile zombified piglins have slightly different pathfinding than when they are neutral. For example, they fall off edges that would cause them to take fall damage in an attempt to reach their target where most other mobs would otherwise not.

When a zombified piglin is angered, the normal piglins do not get aggressive, and vice versa.

Unlike other zombie variants, zombified piglins do not attack [[villager]]s and [[wandering trader]]s. However, a villager that accidentally damages a zombified piglin with a firework rocket (after the player defeats a raid) will provoke any nearby zombified piglins to retaliate against the villager, and as a zombie variant, zombified piglins turn regular villagers into [[zombie villager]]s.{{only|JE|short=1}}<ref>This does not occur in {{BE}} because zombified piglins are not in the {{cd|zombie}} family, and mobs in the {{cd|zombie}} family can convert villagers into zombie villagers.</ref>

*The zombified piglin's angry sound is played twice the speed of the original sound file in the game.{{only|java|short=1}}
*Applying the Classic Texture Pack changes the zombified piglin's model and texture back to a zombie pigman.{{only|Bedrock}}
*There is a glitch where the zombified piglin texture appears as the zombie pigman even without the Classic Texture Pack.{{only|Bedrock}}
*In {{MCL}}, piglins don't zombify in the [[Overworld]] because they breathe in [[Nether wart]] spores.<ref>https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/craft-your-own-legend/piglin</ref>
* In the 2013 ''[[wikipedia:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode ''Girl in the Flower Dress'', Jemma Simmons mentions that another character "runs a rather nasty mob" of zombie pigmen.<ref>{{ytl|F_QDFf-WTVw|Marvel's Agents of SHIELD - Episode 5 - Minecraft Reference||October 23, 2013}}</ref>
