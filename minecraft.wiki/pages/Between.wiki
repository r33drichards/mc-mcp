'''Between''' is a joke [[biome]] introduced in [[Java Edition 20w14∞]]. It generates in the <code>fleet</code> dimension.

== Description ==
If created as a [[Buffet]] world, the between biome consists of somewhat hilly terrain made out of [[stone]]. Some hills can reach Y=90. The biome is filled with an infinite fleet of [[end ship]]s in a grid pattern, generating both in the sky and the underground. The fleet has three layers of end ships. The lowest blocks of the lowest end ships generate at Y=50, and the highest blocks of the highest end ships generate at Y=173. There are no caves or any other terrain features. No [[mob]]s spawn naturally in this biome.

The end ships are almost identical to those that spawn in [[end cities]], with two key differences:
*no [[shulker]]s spawn on them,
*there is no [[item frame]] with [[elytra]] or end city loot in the [[chest]]. Instead, each chest contain a single written book called [[Java_Edition_20w14%E2%88%9E#General|"orders"]].

[[Brewing stand]]s with [[Instant Health]] potions and [[dragon head]]s still generate.

In the <code>fleet</code> dimension, the end ship fleet is identical, but the dimension generates no terrain: all the ships hover over the void.
