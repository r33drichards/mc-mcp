A '''pale garden''' is a rare pale variant of the [[dark forest]] biome. It features [[pale oak]]s, [[pale moss block]]s, and [[pale moss carpet]]s. [[Creaking heart]]s that spawn [[creaking]]s at night can often be found here.

== Description ==
Pale gardens are a biome variant of [[dark forest]]s which generate adjacent to dark forests in areas of high [[continentalness]] and [[weirdness]]. They mainly consist of [[pale oak tree]]s, along with [[pale moss patch]]es made of [[pale moss block]]s and [[pale moss carpet]]s, and scattered [[eyeblossom]]s. [[Pale hanging moss]] can also be found hanging off the trees. Some of the pale oak trees contain a [[creaking heart]] block, which spawns a [[creaking]] when activated at night. [[Woodland mansion]]s can generate in pale gardens. The water, sky, and blocks of the biome are desaturated. With [[Vibrant Visuals]], the pale garden has an extremely dense pale fog that blocks all skylight and limits the view to only a few chunks.

Pale gardens are rare. Besides dark forests, pale gardens uncommonly border [[old growth pine taiga]]s, [[forest]]s, [[birch forest]]s, [[meadow]]s, [[jungle]]s and [[grove]]s, with an even smaller chance to border [[old growth birch forest]]s, [[taiga]]s, [[frozen peaks]], [[sparse jungle]]s and [[bamboo jungle]]s. Unlike most biome variants, pale gardens are not separated from dark forests by [[river]]s most of the time, though a river commonly generates nearby.

Ambient music does not play in pale gardens. If a music track is playing while the player enters the biome, it fades into silence. The music resumes when the player exits the biome.

== Mobs ==
[[Creaking]]s are found in this biome only at night, but their spawning is controlled by [[creaking heart]]s, not the biome. Since naturally generated Pale Oaks only have a 20% chance to include a creaking heart, it is possible to have Pale Gardens with no creaking hearts and no creakings, especially if they are smaller areas.

Regular passive mobs do not naturally spawn in the pale garden,<ref>{{mcnet|the-pale-garden|The pale garden|October 2, 2024|Sophie Austin}}</ref> but normal hostile mobs can spawn here, sometimes even during the day because of the thick foliage.<ref>{{ytl|rez5M40j5fg|Minecraft Live 2024: Developer After-Show|Minecraft|September 28, 2024|t=492s}}</ref>

== Trivia ==
* In a tweet, it is mentioned that the reason why the creaking and eyeblossoms are inactive during the day is because they are asleep.<ref>{{tweet|Minecraft|1863976836289466408|Something stirs in the pale garden!<br><br>Play the Garden Awakens drop today and explore a biome that's sleepy during the day – and unsettling at night. Follow the trail of blooming eyeblossoms deeper into the darkness and you might come face to face with the creaking.<br><br>Stay tuned for a new Minecraft Monthly for more unexpected surprises- including some rewards 👀 aka.ms/the-garden-awa|December 3, 2024}}</ref>
* Pale gardens have the least vibrant colors of any biome in the game.
