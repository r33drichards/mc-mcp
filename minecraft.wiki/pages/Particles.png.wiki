<samp>'''particles.png'''</samp> and related particle atlases are [[texture atlases]] found inside the game's internal [[resource packs]] used to load the majority of the game's [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particle]] textures, excluding those derived from other textures.

== Usage ==
These texture atlases are used for [[Particles (Bedrock Edition)|particle]] textures. The main file, <samp>particles.png</samp>, is used for the majority of particles. Some particles with dynamic textures, such as campfire smoke and falling leaves have their own texture atlases. Texture atlases can be found in {{Cd|[[Bedrock Edition installation files|Content]]/data/resource_packs/vanilla_''version''/textures/particle}} or <code>.../particles</code>, where the version number corresponds to the latest version the texture atlas has been modified. Each particle defines which texture atlas it uses in its JSON file in the same resource pack. Each particle atlas has an associated [[texture set]] which defines the MERS values used in [[Vibrant Visuals]].

The following particle atlases are currently in use:

Note that most pixels are transparent because they have a subsurface scattering value of 0, but other channels can still have values. See {{slink|Particles (Bedrock Edition)|Texture files}} for files edited to ignore the alpha channel.

Custom texture atlases may be created in [[resource packs]] for custom particles.

== Format ==
<samp>particles.png</samp> may have changed width with time. The file is split into different squares, usually 8×8 but bigger for some other cases, which correspond to the texture of many particles found in-game. Like with <samp>[[items.png]]</samp>, unused sections of the texture are completely transparent, unlike with <samp>[[terrain.png]]</samp> and [[kz.png|the paintings sheet]] where such regions are colored magenta.

== History ==
{{info needed section|[[Legacy Console Edition]] and changes of other texture atlases}}
=== ''Java Edition'' ===
<samp>particles.png</samp> was compressed in [[Java Edition 13w09c|13w09c]], [[Java Edition 15w49a|15w49a]], and [[Java Edition 1.11-pre1|1.11-pre1]]. <samp>explosion.png</samp> was compressed in 13w09c and 15w49a, and <samp>explosion.png</samp> and <samp>sweep.png</samp> in 1.11-pre1.
