The '''Foundation Stone''' is a powerful block representing the code of a {{MC}} world, appearing as a major plot point in ''[[Minecraft: Woodsword Chronicles]]''.

== Appearance ==
The block resembles a nondescript [[stone]] block, if not a generic block with no texture, save for a collection of light colored squiggles. Late into the book it is depicted with a fourth dimensional texture, similar to an [[End Portal (block)|end portal]], resembling a spiral galaxy.

== Properties ==
Anyone who claims the Stone gains ownership of a world, enabling them to freely manipulate and contort it to their liking. It appears to grant similar effects to [[creative]], with wielders being able to fly and build freely. However, it appears to grant greater capabilities than that, with the game itself being shown to become vulnerable and unstable. It can be used by both [[Evoker King|artificial intelligence]] and players using [[VR goggles]], with the latter feeling transcendental stimulation, suggesting it might hold some semblance of physical power. Only one person is able to use the power at a given time, physical contact being all that's needed to transfer ownership.

== History ==
At an unknown time, the Foundation Stone was created as a mod for a {{MC}} server hosted by [[Woodsword Middle School]]. This attracted the attention of an AI computer network, which quickly took on the identity of the [[Evoker King]] to try and claim the Stone. In order to protect the world, [[Theo Grayson]] placed the Foundation Stone inside of a [[Dungeon (Woodsword Chronicles)|dungeon]] of his own design, protected by several modded [[guards]].

While investigating the conspiracy, [[Ms. Minerva]] caught wind of the Foundation Stone and the dungeon created around it. While under the guise of the Librarian, she warned her [[BLOCK HEADZ|students]] and gave its location, incentivizing them to seek it out. They quickly manage to locate the dungeon at the center of the [[Overworld]], and after many hardships are able to open the vault containing the Foundation Stone. However, this turned out to be part of the Evoker King's plan, successfully tricking them into giving him what he wanted.

Now with the power of the whole world, the Evoker King constructs a colossal [[Evoker King's tower|tower]]. In spite of this power, he is quickly lured out of this lair by a petty remark, and summons an army of [[mobs]] to thwart his opposition. As the fight rages on, [[Po Chen]] is able to outsmart the King, taking on the guise of Theo as a distraction while the rest of the team infiltrate his fortress. It's then revealed that the Foundation Stone was built into the King's throne, which enables [[Jodi Mercado|Jodi]] to harness this power for herself. Now in control of the world, she choses to be merciful, refurbishing the Evoker King's room for him and sparing the AI.

In order to prevent the situation from repeating, the group collectively agreed to banish the Stone back into the dungeon.
