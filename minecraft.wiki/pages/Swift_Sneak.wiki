'''Swift Sneak''' is an [[enchantment]] applied to [[leggings]] that lessens the movement speed reduction that occurs when [[sneaking]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Loot chest ===
{{LootChestItem|enchanted-book-rnd-swift-sneak}}

Swift Sneak can be obtained only from loot chests in [[ancient cities]], making it non-renewable. The chests can contain [[enchanted book]]s with any level of Swift Sneak.

== Usage ==
=== Speed ===
Swift Sneak increases the player's [[sneaking speed]] by 15% per level. At Swift Sneak level 3, the player's crouch speed equals 75% of their normal walking speed. Swift Sneak 4 and 5 can further improve crouching speed, but the crouching speed can never be faster than the player's walking speed. Past Swift Sneak 4, the player can also [[sprint]] while they are already sneaking, even without the use of {{bug|MC-152728}}.{{only|je}} The player can sprint while sneaking with Swift Sneak 3 by pressing {{control|sprint}}.

This enchantment also increases the player's movement speed while they are [[crawling]].
