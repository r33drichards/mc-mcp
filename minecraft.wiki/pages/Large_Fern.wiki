The '''large fern''' is the 2-block tall variant of the [[fern]]. 

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
When [[broken]] normally, a large fern has a 12.5% chance of dropping 1 [[wheat seeds]] item. This is affected by the [[Fortune]] enchantment, dropping 1–3, 1–5, or 1–7 wheat seeds with Fortune I, II, and III respectively.

When broken using [[shears]], a large fern drops two [[fern]]s instead.

Placing any block on a large fern breaks the fern and causes it to not drop any [[wheat seeds]].
{{breaking row|horizontal=1|Large Fern|Shears=1|drop=0}}

=== Natural generation ===
Large ferns occur naturally only in [[taiga]], [[snowy taiga]], and [[old growth taiga]] biomes.

Large ferns can additionally be found around some taiga and snowy taiga{{only|be|short=1}} [[village]] houses.

=== Generated loot ===
{{LootChestItem|large-fern}}

=== Post-generation ===
[[Bone meal]] can be used on a [[fern]] to grow it into a large fern.

== Usage ==
Most 2-block tall plants, including large ferns, have a disproportionately large hitbox compared to other plants.<ref>{{bug|MC-33580||The hitbox of double-tall plants is inconsistently big|WAI}}</ref> The only exception to this rule is [[tall seagrass]].<ref>{{bug|MC-163896||Double tall seagrass's hitbox is inconsistent with that of other double tall plants|WAI}}</ref>

=== Composting ===
Placing a large fern into a [[composter]] has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.
