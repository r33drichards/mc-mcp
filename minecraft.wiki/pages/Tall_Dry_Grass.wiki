'''Tall dry grass''' is the tall variant of dry grass. Unlike other tall variants of foliage, this block is only one-block tall. It generates frequently in [[desert]]s and all types of [[badlands]], and looks like a more full version of short dry grass. It also grows on [[sand]] and [[terracotta]], and can be eaten by [[sheep]].

== Obtaining ==
=== Breaking ===
Tall dry grass can be broken instantly with any item or by hand. If broken with [[shears]] or any tool enchanted with [[Silk Touch]] it drops itself, otherwise it drops nothing.

Tall dry grass generates in [[desert]]s and [[badlands]].

{{Block distribution}}

=== Post generation ===
Using [[Bone Meal|bone meal]] on [[short dry grass]] turns it into tall dry grass.

=== Trading ===
[[Wandering trader]]s may sell 1 tall dry grass for 1 [[emerald]].

== Usage ==
Tall dry grass can be used for aesthetic decoration. Tall dry grass can be placed on any of the following blocks:
{{columns-list|style=column-count:2|
* {{BlockLink|Grass Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Mycelium}}
* {{BlockLink|Podzol}}
* {{BlockLink|Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Coarse Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Rooted Dirt}}
* {{BlockLink|Farmland}}
* {{BlockLink|Terracotta}}
* {{BlockLink|Sand}}
* {{BlockLink|Suspicious Sand}}
* {{BlockLink|Red Sand}}
* {{BlockLink|Mud}}
* {{BlockLink|Muddy Mangrove Roots}}
* {{BlockLink|Moss Block}}
* {{BlockLink|Pale Moss Block}}
}}

{{IN|bedrock}}, tall dry grass can be [[snowlogged]].

When a [[sheep]] eats tall dry grass, the block is removed, and a [[shear]]ed sheep regrows its [[wool]]. Baby sheep graze tall dry grass 20 times more often than adults and mature 1 minute faster when grazing.

=== Fuel ===
When used in a [[furnace]] as [[fuel]], a piece of tall dry grass lasts 5 seconds (smelting half an item).

=== Composting ===
Placing tall dry grass into a [[composter]] has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1, the lowest chance possible. On average, a stack of tall dry grass yields 2.74 [[Bone Meal|bone meal]].

=== Bone meal ===
Bone meal can be used on tall dry grass to place a [[Short Dry Grass|short dry grass]] on a neighboring block if possible.

=== Ambience ===
If placed on [[sand]], [[red sand]] or a [[terracotta]] block of any kind with at least one more corresponding block underneath it, tall dry grass produces [[Ambience|ambient sounds]] reminiscent of dry leaves rustling, wind howling and insects rattling. These ambient sounds can play anywhere if the given conditions are met, and naturally play in the [[badlands]] and [[desert]] biomes due to the abundance of dry grass on top of said blocks.
